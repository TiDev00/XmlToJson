   Mayor Marion Barry turned over ``the duties
and functions'' of his office to an aide Friday after being
formally charged with drug possession in an FBI sting that
officials said included a videotape of Barry smoking crack cocaine.
   Barry did not give up his office, which he has held for 11
years, and retained authority to sign and veto legislation and
approve contracts.
   The drug charge added to the turbulence of the political
situation in the nation's capital, where Barry had already been
under fire and the list of challengers for next November's election
had been growing. Jesse Jackson, the leader in early polls though
he has said he would not run against Barry, said Friday he felt
only sorrow about the new development and would not talk politics.
   Federal prosecutors said Barry tested positive for cocaine in
blood and urine tests after he was taken into custody Thursday
night at a Washington hotel. His lawyer said Friday he would plead
innocent to the charge.
   The FBI used a woman to get Barry to the hotel room, said a law
enforcement source who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The woman was identified by sources familiar with the case as
Rasheeda Moore. One source said Ms. Moore agreed to cooperate with
the FBI's investigation of Barry after she got into trouble with
state authorities in California.
   The Washington Times said in an extra edition Friday afternoon
that Ms. Moore, according to one law enforcement source, agreed to
cooperate with the FBI because she believed Barry ``needed help
because he had been addicted before and had been showing signs of
being addicted again.''
   According to the newspaper's account, she invited Barry to a
party at the hotel. But three of the party-goers were FBI agents.
   Barry, the newspaper said, was taking off his shirt when
arrested. But a narrative of the same events described by The
Washington Post in Saturday morning editions said Barry ``had just
started'' to put on his coat as if to leave when agents burst in to
announce, ``You are under arrest. Remain still.'' Sources for the
two accounts were not named.
   U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens denied that the mayor had been
unlawfully entrapped by the operation, saying prosecutors had found
evidence of Barry's predisposition to commit drug-related crimes.
   ``Wherever there is predisposition there is not entrapment,''
said Stephens. ``It was scrupulously fair to the subject of the
investigation, Mr. Barry.''
   After Friday's brief court hearing, in even briefer remarks to
reporters swarming around the Federal Courthouse, Barry said, ``I'm
going to leave here and go about the business of government.''
   But the mayor's office issued a statement later which said he
was temporarily giving up his day-to-day mayor's chores because of
a ``need for time to handle his legal matters, his concern for his
family, and because it is in the best interests of the citizens of
Washington, D.C.''
   He has been plagued in recent years by accusations of drug use
as well as the corruption convictions of several top city
officials. He has repeatedly denied ever using or buying drugs.
   Barry had indicated he would seek a fourth term this November,
though opposing candidates have proliferated as his troubles have
mounted. A formal Barry candidacy announcement, scheduled for
Sunday, was postponed indefinitely.
   Former Democratic presidential candidate Jackson, who has
campaigned against drugs across the country, fueled speculation he
would run for mayor when he moved to Washington last year. But
Jackson also has said he would not directly challenge Barry, a
former civil rights colleague.
   Jackson said Friday in Chicago that the Barry matter should be
``handled in a courtroom, not a newsroom'' and that he was ``in no
mood'' to deal with questions about politics.
   In the statement released by his office, Barry said, ``I want to
assure my friends, colleagues, supporters, fellow citizens, the
business community and the nation that this government will
continue to operate at maximum performance. I know I have a team of
competent professionals who will continue to run the affairs of
government while I devote some time to my legal case.''
   The statement, which said he was turning over day-to-day mayor's
duties to city administrator Carol Thompson, was released after he
huddled with cabinet members and political advisers.
   Sources commenting on condition they not be named said several
cabinet members threatened to resign if Barry did not step aside
from most city affairs.
   If convicted, the mayor could face penalties of up to one year
in jail and a $100,000 fine, said U.S. Attorney Stephens.
   Barry was arrested at an FBI-rented hotel room that was being
watched through a surveillance camera. He gave ``a quantity of
currency'' to a cooperating witness in return for the crack,
according to court papers filed by federal prosecutors.
   ``Mr. Barry put some of the crack cocaine in a smoking
apparatus, lit the crack cocaine and smoked it,'' FBI agent Ronald
Stern said in an affidavit. ``I observed Mr. Barry ... inhale on
the lit smoking apparatus.''
   Federal agents then entered the hotel room and arrested the
mayor, who officials said later tested positive for cocaine when
blood and urine tests were given under a warrant. He was taken to
FBI headquarters and released on his own recognizance.
   Officers also took samples of the mayor's hair, which law
enforcement authorities say can be used to determine drug use.
   Stephens said that Barry went to the Vista Hotel ``in his
limousine, accompanied by security guards. He entered on his own
volition. He went to the seventh floor on his own free will. He put
himself in that situation.''
   The prosecutor said the mayor's arrest was part of a continuing
investigation of a ``broad range of allegations'' against Barry. He
later specified that the probe deals with fraud and city contracts
as well as narcotics.
   U.S. Magistrate Deborah Robinson allowed the mayor to remain
free but ordered him to undergo drug tests every Monday. He also
must make weekly phone calls to a pretrial services agency and will
face another court appearance Feb. 5.
   Barry's court appearance came less than two hours before the
sentencing of Charles Lewis, a former friend of the mayor and now a
cooperating government witness against Barry, for conspiracy to
distribute cocaine. When Lewis pleaded guilty to the charge last
year, he told the judge he had given cocaine to the mayor.
   Lewis was sentenced to 15 months in prison, but was given credit
for time served and is to be released in May.

<HEAD>New Official Opposed by AIDS Activists</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Indiana state Health Commissioner Dr. Woodrow A.
Myers Jr. was named New York City's top health official Friday
despite opposition to his AIDS policies by gay rights activists and
a prominent AIDS researcher.
   Mayor David N. Dinkins announced the appointment of Myers as
city health commissioner just one day after several supporters on a
search committee withdrew their backing. Among those who stopped
supporting Myers was Dr. Mathilde Krim, co-founder of the American
Foundation on AIDS Research.
   Myers supports Indiana laws to keep government lists of those
infected with the AIDS virus and to quarantine people who knowingly
infect others.
   The Indiana official has said he wouldn't impose such policies
in New York and would support the policies of Dinkins, who opposes
quarantines and government lists.
   Despite the controversial AIDS policies in Indiana, Myers has a
national reputation as an AIDS expert. He is credited with
encouraging Indiana doctors to treat AIDS patients and was
instrumental in arranging schooling for Ryan White, a teen-age
AIDS-afflicted hemopheliac who received national attention when a
local school board refused to enroll him.
   Myers also made headlines by resigning from his post as vice
chairman of the President's Commission on HIV under Ronald Reagan
to protest what he said were inadequacies with the group. HIV, or
the human immunodeficiency virus, causes AIDS.
   On Thursday, Krim and several other members of the search
committee withdrew support from him. Krim cited ``profound
differences'' between Myers' views and ``desirable public health
policies.''
   ``I'm not the insensitive, brutish fiend that some people have
tried to make me out to be,'' Myers said this week.
   Myers on Friday underscored that, saying ``quarantine is not an
effective health strategy.''
   Myers, 35, will earn $110,000 a year as commissioner and also
get an annual $22,000 supplement as an assistant professor of
medicine at the Cornell University Medical School.
   In outlining the challenges facing the appointee, Dinkins
referred to a recent study that found a man in Bangladesh has a
better chance of living past age 40 than a man in Harlem.
   ``The causes of this shocking finding will set the agenda for
the new health commissioner: drug and alcohol abuse, cirrhosis,
violence and the spread of disease, including the AIDS epidemic,''
Dinkins said.
   There have been 23,000 AIDS cases in New York and 12,000 have
died. At least 200,000 New Yorkers, and perhaps nearly twice that
many, have been infected with the virus.
   Protests continued Friday afternoon, with about 75 members of
the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power picketing in front of City
Hall, chanting, ``No testing. No quarantine. No Myers. No way.''
There were no arrests.
   Indiana law requires the reporting by name of any person who
tests positive for the human immunodeficiency virus.
   The names of infected people are collected and stored in
confidential files at the state Board of Health. The information is
used to contact sex partners deemed at risk and to target state
prevention efforts.

<HEAD>South Florida Beaches Covered With Oil, Jellyfish</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sticky gobs of oil and grotesque
Portuguese men-of-war, blown ashore by an east wind, have made the
footing treacherous on some beaches in south Florida.
   The Coast Guard hadn't determined the source of the tar-like
glop washed by strong winds and surf onto beaches around Fort
Lauderdale.
   ``It's wet and clinging to everything that's floating,'' said
area resident Pauline Gerweck. ``Tourists are coming out covered
head to toe. ... This is scandalous.''
   The jellyfish-like men-of-war, whose sting can be dangerous to
the allergic, are flopping ashore from the Keys to Jupiter in Palm
Beach County, about a 200-mile stretch. But few stings have been
reported because bathers are staying out of the water, which has
been stirred by rainshowers and rough seas.
   ``I think with all the warnings, people are staying out of the
water,'' Bonnetta Kaplan, a lifeguard in Pompano Beach, said
Wednesday. ``When something like this happens, we load the beach
with signs.''
   Two weeks ago, hundreds of swimmers were stung in south Florida
when swarms of the jellyfish washed up on the beaches.
   ``That coincided with some real nice sunny weather,'' said Capt.
Bill Pallowick of the Fort Lauderdale Beach Patrol. ``There are
probably 10 times more of them out there today, but the weather is
not good.''
   It was harder for beach-going tourists to avoid the tar spots.
   Jim Haskell, a tourist from Newburyport, Mass., said the soles
of his feet were black with oil after he strolled near Anglin's
Pier in Lauderdale-by-the-Sea.
   ``There were some little kids in the surf and they were just
covered with it,'' Haskell said.
   Coast Guard officer Pete Thiel, in Fort Lauderdale, said the
Coast Guard twice inspected tankers anchored off the city's coast
on Wednesday but found no evidence of leaks.
   Huge oil tankers enter and leave Port Everglades daily and
frequently anchor off Fort Lauderdale. Thiel said tankers sometimes
pump oily bilge water into the ocean in violation of federal law.

   An FBI agent and a bank robbery suspect were
killed, and two FBI agents were wounded in a shootout at a home
Friday night, authorities said.
   The agents, who were members of a SWAT team, were executing a
search warrant about 7:15 p.m. in south St. Louis County when the
suspect opened fire with a shotgun, FBI spokesman David Binney said.
   The names of the agents weren't immediately available. The agent
who was killed was pronounced dead at 9 p.m. at St. Anthony's
Hospital, Binney said.
   Wounds to the other two agents weren't believed to be serious.
One of the agents was shot in the arm and the other was shot in the
leg. Both were taken to St. Anthony's Hospital, Binney said.
   The suspect was identified as James Price, 45.
   The agents were looking for money taken in a Jan. 3 robbery of
Community Savings &amp; Loan near Price's home, Binney said.
   ``We used a SWAT team because we had information that the man
was armed and dangerous,'' Binney said. ``The SWAT team penetrated
the door and shooting occurred.''

<HEAD>Barry Rose From Sharecropper's Son</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-DC Mayor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL PAGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Awssociated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marion Barry Jr. was a sharecropper's son who
used the streetwise bravado he learned as a civil rights activist
to become a savvy political insider who served more than a decade
as mayor of the nation's capital.
   Always claiming he could move as easily among royalty as among
the city's poor, Barry shrugged off scandals involving top aides
and allegations of drug abuse to win election three times to the
city's top position.
   During his tenure, Barry made the most of the limited power of
the city's home rule charter to make himself the undisputed leader
of the city government.
   But Barry was also under federal investigation during much of
the period between 1984 and 1990 for his ties to drug suspects.
Several of his friends have gone to jail and recent news reports
suggested the wall of silence that prosecutors had tried to
penetrate was crumbling as some former associates testified before
a grand jury.
   Barry has always called himself a survivor, pointing to the
gunshot wound he suffered in the city hall building in 1977 as an
example of how he could never be counted out.
   ``He is not going to go out quietly,'' said Max Berry, a former
key political adviser, after the arrest.
   Berry, who turned against Barry after the mayor's troubles last
year, added: ``If he has not been telling the truth to the people,
he's going to face the possibility of resigning, but he has always
been a strong campaigner and a proud person. What kind of effect
this will have on his ego, I don't know.''
   Indeed, Barry's most recent boasts of political power were
earlier this month.
   A Los Angeles Times profile got him into political hot water
when he was quoted as boasting that he would cut his opponents
``off at the kneecaps'' and that Jesse Jackson, whom Barry had
supported, ``don't wanna run nothing but his mouth.''
   Barry and his third wife, Effi, have one son, Christopher, who
is 10.
   Barry was born on March 6, 1936 to Marion and Mattie Barry, in
the small Mississippi delta town of Itta Bena, and was raised in
Memphis after the death of his father, a sharecropper.
   ``My background is one of survival,'' Barry told The Washington
Post a month before his first election as mayor in 1978. ``I mean I
was lucky, you know. I used to run around with guys who went to
prison or are dead. I was lucky. I was the one who didn't get
caught by the police when we were out shooting dice or something.''
   Barry did graduate work in chemistry at Fisk University in
Nashville, but was sidetracked on his way to a doctorate by the
growing civil rights movement and left school with a master's
degree. He was the first national chairman of the Student
Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, which sent young people into
the South to register black voters.
   It was SNCC that brought him to Washington, where he became
immersed in local issues, joining boycotts of the bus system.
   With his second wife, Mary Treadwell, he helped found a black
self-help group, Pride, Inc. Treadwell was convicted in 1983 of
misusing funds in connection with a real estate spinoff of Pride.
   It was Barry's high profile as an anti-establishment activist
that propelled him into local politics, first as a member of the
Board of Education and then in 1974 as a member of the first
elected City Council organized under the home rule legislation.
   He suffered his first personal crisis in 1977 when he was
wounded by a shotgun blast in the Hanafi Muslim takeover of the
District Building, the district's city hall. A young reporter was
killed.
   In 1978, he defeated incumbent Mayor Walter Washington in the
city's Democratic mayoral primary and went on to easily win the
general election, taking over a government he had railed against
only a decade before.
   ``I want to take the boards off of houses and put people in
them, I want to provide minimal care for all people, regardless of
their financial situation and I want to live out (Dr. Martin
Luther) King's legacy of peace, brotherhood and survival,'' he said
shortly after being sworn in.
   His tenure has been noted for extensive downtown office and
hotel development, a soaring murder rate among young drug users
and, critics charge, deterioration of services like housing despite
the largest city bureaucracy in the country on a per-capita basis.
   His troubles began shortly after his first re-election in 1982,
with the first of federal investigations he termed attempts to
``lynch black people another way.''
   In 1984, Karen Johnson, a convicted cocaine dealer with whom
Barry admitted having a ``personal'' relationship, served 11 months
in jail on contempt of court charges rather than tell investigators
whether she used drugs with or sold them to the mayor.
   The current round of investigation was touched off in December
1988, when Barry repeatedly visited the hotel room of a suspected
drug dealer. That man, Charles Lewis, was later convicted of
cocaine charges in the Virgin Islands and has pleaded guilty to a
drug conspiracy count in Washington. There have been recent news
reports that Lewis had told prosecutors he had provided drugs to
the mayor.

   The government tried Thursday to intimidate
witnesses who testified for one of Manuel Noriega's co-defendents
by threatening them with immigration agents who questioned their
legal status, a defense attorney charged.
   The agents demanded that three witnesses who testified for Luis
del Cid on Tuesday turn over all their immigration papers and give
information about how they obtained passports into the United
States, said Samuel Burstyn, del Cid's attorney.
   Burstyn filed a motion late Thursday asking U.S. District Judge
William Hoeveler to order the government to refrain from contacting
defense witnesses without their permission.
   Burstyn told the Associated Press that he hoped to hear Friday
morning when Hoeveler would grant a hearing on his emergency
motion. The U.S. Attorney's office had no immediate comment.
   Earlier Thursday, defense attorneys accused the government of
balking at court orders to turn over both secret and non-secret
documents to aid the defense in the case against Noriega and his
co-defendants.
   And a lawyer for convicted drug kingpin Carlos Lehder Rivas
strongly denied his client will cooperate with the government to
convict the deposed Panamanian leader, despite a taped interview
the imprisoned trafficker gave implicating Noriega.
   On Wednesday, Hoeveler announced a March 5 trial date for
Noriega and the other defendants after Burstyn demanded his
client's right to a speedy trial.
   Burstyn said he hoped the date _ far earlier than the nine
months to two years most attorneys had anticipated _ would force
the government to cease dragging its feet on documents.
   ``There is a desire to stonewall information,'' Burstyn said.
``It's an effort to hermetically seal off the guts and gore of the
early investigation.''
   He emphasized he has not yet requested CIA or other sensitive
records, only routine matters such as the prior criminal record of
Floyd Carlton Carceres, the former Noriega pilot whose testimony
helped bring about the February 1988 drug-trafficking indictment.
   U.S. attorney's office spokeswoman Diane Cossin refused to
comment, beyond saying defense attorneys ``should do as instructed
and not try this case in the media.''
   One attorney who has unsuccessfully sought secret material is
Michael O'Kane, lawyer for accused drug pilot Daniel Miranda. When
he requested information from a National Security Agency listening
post in Panama City, prosecutors threatened to try him just for
revealing its existence.
   ``I tend to think that a lot of this case is going to go away,
because I don't think that a lot of the intelligence agencies want
to reveal things,'' O'Kane said.
   He said Noriega was a CIA asset since at least the 1960s, and
noted the case of CIA agent Joe Fernandez, whose indictment in the
Iran-Contra affair was eventually dropped because the government
feared the trial would reveal too many secrets.
   ``Joe Fernandez's case had to be dismissed, and Joe Fernandez
was a pipsqueak compared to Noriega,'' O'Kane said.
   The lawyer said that from the reaction of the U.S. attorney's
office to requests for information, he suspected the prosecturs
were not receiving cooperation from Washington agencies.
   ``I don't think anyone is telling them just what the situation
is,'' he said.
   Speculation that the government may have the help of testimony
from convicted Medellin cartel trafficker Lehder was dismissed by
Lehder's attorney, Jose Quinon.
   In a prison interview with the West German magazine Stern,
recorded in November and broadcast Wednesday on NBC News, Lehder
said he had paid Noriega several million dollars for protection.
   Lehder also said Noriega confiscated drugs and processing
equipment, then sold it to drug dealers in Colombia, Panama and the
United States.
   Quinon said Thursday that the interview was Lehder's idea, and
was no indication he planned to cooperate with prosecutors trying
Noriega.
   ``He will be no witness against Noriega, there is no deal,
there's no cooperation with the government,'' Quinon said.
   The U.S. attorney's office spokeswoman, Ms. Cossin, said she
could not reveal the names of witnesses.

   Welcome to sophomore history, a look at
post-World War II global events. Now put on your headphones and
pump up the volume, dude.
   It's the classroom of the '90s, where Billy Joel's No. 1 single
``We Didn't Start the Fire'' will soon have teachers turning to
their turntables to help students learn about history from Harry
Truman to Tiananmen Square.
   A special cassette version of the rapid-fire single, including a
10-minute talk by Joel, will be provided to 40,000 junior and
senior high school students nationwide, according to the singer's
label, CBS Records.
   ``A lot of people tend to think history is just this drab series
of boring names and dates that you just have to connect to pass the
test,'' Joel says on the tape. ``Really, history is a living thing.
We are where we are today, and we are who we are today, because of
our history.''
   Joel says he's received letters from both teachers and students
about the song, his highest-charting single since ``Uptown Girl''
in November 1983. The Grammy-winning singer-songwriter also reveals
on the tape that he once considered a career as a history teacher.
   The cassette will be distributed in conjunction with Scholastic
magazine; teachers will receive a poster-sized copy of the lyrics
and a lesson plan to aid them.
   The tapes will be sent out with the Jan. 26 issue of Junior
Scholastic magazine, for junior high school students, and Update
magazine, for high schoolers, said Scholastic public relations
manager Stephanie Feuer.
   ``We're trying to create a bridge between the classroom and
what's going on in the outside world,'' said Ms. Feuer. ``We're
bringing their world into the classroom.''
   Joel packs enough images into the song to fill a few volumes of
the World Book: He begins with Harry Truman, touches on the Korean
War, ``trouble in the Suez,'' ``Belgians in the Congo,'' the JFK
assassination, then wraps it up with a string of current events
climaxing with ``rock and roller cola wars.''
   Each year from 1949 through 1963 gets a verse; USA Today
described it as ``musical Cliff Notes.''
   Joel, in an interview with Rolling Stone, said teachers have
told him the song is ``the greatest teaching tool to come down the
pike since Sesame Street, which means a lot to me.''
   A fifth-grade class at the Banta Elementary School in Menasha,
Wis., used the song lyrics last year to select topics for history
reports.
   The single is from Joel's ``Storm Front'' album; its success has
not been limited to the United States. ``We Didn't Start the Fire''
has gone Top Five in Canada, Australia, Japan and Germany, while
hitting the Top 10 in England, Holland, Norway and New Zealand.
   Joel's interests weren't strictly educational _ there is a
record to be sold, as Ms. Feuer noted.
   ``These kids are part of the record-buying public, and he hasn't
had a No. 1 record in six, seven years,'' she said. ``The record
company wanted to do something a little different.''

<HEAD>McMartin Child Abuse Case Changed Social, Legal Landscape</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MITCHELL LANDSBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   It began as the nation's largest child abuse case and ended as
the nation's longest trial. In the six years between, the McMartin
Pre-School case helped incite a revolution in the way society
treats its youngest victims.
   It was August 1983 when a woman named Judy Johnson called the
police in Manhattan Beach, Calif., to say that her son had a red
bottom and was talking about a man named Ray. Ray worked at the
McMartin Pre-School.
   What followed was a nightmare _ a legal case that became too
long, too cumbersome, too expensive and too traumatic. It ended
Thursday with the jury acquitting the defendants of 52 charges and
declaring themselves hopelessly deadlocked on the remaining 13.
   Regardless of the outcome, experts say the case has led to
fundamental changes in the way society looks at child abuse.
   ``McMartin made it evident to everyone working with kids and the
legal system that there had to be some changes,'' said Nancy
Peterson, a spokeswoman for the Chicago-based National Committee
for Prevention of Child Abuse.
   ``I think that it's safe to say that it has influenced a great
deal of reform on behalf of kids.''
   Some of those reforms have been in the regulation of child care.
Many states now require background checks, including fingerprints,
for all child care workers.
   There also is a growing emphasis on training, so that teachers
and child care workers, as well as parents and children, know how
to recognize the signs of sexual abuse.
   The unfortunate legacy of McMartin may be the suspicion it cast
on an overwhelmingly innocent group of people _ the adults who care
for children in day-care centers and nursery schools.
   A study by the American Association for Protecting Children
showed that about 65 percent of child abuse cases involved an older
relative of the child, and only about 5 percent involved baby
sitters or child care workers.
   Other studies have shown the percentage of sexual abuse cases
involving child care workers to be as low as half of 1 percent.
   It's hard to say just how many of the changes in child care
legislation can be traced to the McMartin case.
   Interest in child care had been rising as more women entered the
workplace. And there have been other notorious child abuse cases.
In one of the most recent, seven people in Edenton, N.C., were
charged with sexually abusing at least 70 children at a day-care
center.
   So the argument can be made that McMartin was only one of many
influences, and that change would have occurred anyway.
   ``The McMartin case was the first one to gain national
notoriety. I'm not sure still, though, that it had that much of an
impact,'' said Katie Bond of the Denver-based American Association
for Protecting Children.
   Others say its influence has been profound.
   ``First and foremost, there has been an enormous increase in
awareness of abuse of children under the age of 6. ... That is a
whole domain that didn't exist prior to McMartin, really,'' said
David Finklehor, co-director of the Family Research Laboratory at
the University of New Hampshire.
   ``Secondly, there's been quite a revolution in the investigation
and handling of sexual abuse cases in the criminal justice system,
and that can be traced to McMartin.''
   For instance, investigators, prosecutors and judges are now
frequently trained to deal with the victims of child abuse, and
some prosecutors employ counselors and other specialists to assist
them.
   In the McMartin case, hundreds of children initially told
investigators that they had been sexually abused, but many of their
accounts were later disregarded as false responses to leading
questions.
   Prosecutors were forced to whittle down their case from hundreds
of charges against seven defendants to 65 charges against two
defendants.
   Investigators since have been taught ``to be less leading, more
objective, and to avoid even the appearance of rewarding the
children for being forthcoming,'' Finklehor said.
   Courtroom procedures in some places have been tailored to the
very young, so they aren't intimidated by formality or legalese. In
some cases, children are allowed to sit on a parent's lap while
testifying.
   Some changes have been controversial. The U.S. Supreme Court
ruled in 1988 that an Iowa man was improperly convicted of sexual
assault because he wasn't allowed to face his 13-year-old accusers
_ they testified with a screen blocking their view of the defendant.
   This week, the court agreed to review two more sexual abuse
cases.
   In one, four children in Maryland were allowed to testify with
only a prosecutor and a defense lawyer present. In the other, in
Idaho, a pediatrician was allowed to describe what a 2-year-old
girl told him _ testimony that in adult cases would be considered
hearsay.

   South Korea's crime rate has declined
by about a third since the government ordered nightspots to close
before midnight starting this year, police said today.
   Police reported 7,859 crimes nationally in the first half of
this month, down 29 percent from the same period in December.
   Except for those at tourist hotels, terminals and railway
stations, nightspots were ordered to shut down before midnight this
year in an effort to halt a sudden increase in crime.
   Police and government officials have raided beer halls, discos,
bars, cabarets and nightclubs and punished owners who violate the
new regulations.

<HEAD>`Life After AIDS' Improving, Two Studies Indicate</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Life expectancies are improving for AIDS patients
diagnosed with a certain type of pneumonia, raising hope that the
once uniformly fatal disease is becoming a ``chronic, manageable''
one, researchers say.
   Two studies published in today's Journal of the American Medical
Association indicate adults initially diagnosed with AIDS and with
a pneumonia known as PCP are surviving significantly longer than
they did in the early 1980s.
   PCP, or pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, is the most common
AIDS-related infection and has been considered one of the most
quickly fatal diseases that can overwhelm the damaged immune
systems of people with AIDS.
   ``The data in these reports appear to confirm what clinicians,
investigators, and patients have known for several years: Life
after AIDS is improving and death is no longer as swift and as
certain as in the early years of the epidemic,'' said an editorial
accompanying the studies.
   But the dramatic improvement in two-year AIDS survival hasn't
been matched by a corresponding improvement in five-year survival,
which remains low, said the editorial by Dr. Richard E. Chaisson of
the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore.
   New antibiotics to prevent PCP in AIDS patients, and the highly
successful anti-AIDS drug zidovudine, formerly called AZT, have
produced hope that AIDS has become a ```chronic, manageable
disease,''' Chaisson wrote.
   His editorial accompanied a San Francisco study of 4,323 AIDS
patients that found those who were diagnosed in 1982 and who
initially had PCP survived a median of 10.3 months. Five years
later, that figure had risen to 17.9 months, researchers said.
   But survival worsened over the same period among AIDS patients
initially diagnosed with a type of skin cancer called Kaposi's
sarcoma, a common sign of AIDS. Survival declined from a median of
33.9 months to a median of 18 months, the researchers said.
   The finding may have resulted from a declining proportion of
AIDS patients with KS _ patients who are relatively healthy
compared with pneumonia patients _ reflecting a shift toward more
aggressive forms of AIDS, the researchers said.
   Among patients diagnosed with other opportunistic infections or
malignancies, survival remained the same, the researchers said.
   For 644 patients treated with zidovudine in the San Francisco
study, the drug was a ``significant predictor of survival,'' said
the researchers, led by George H. Lemp of the city's Department of
Public Health.
   Zidovudine was released for widespread use in 1986.
   Overall, in the seven years of the San Francisco study, the
median survival of AIDS patients was 12.5 months, and five-year
survival was 3.4 percent, said the authors.
   The other study published in today's Journal looked at adults
nationwide who were diagnosed with acquired immune deficiency
syndrome in the years 1984 through 1987 and in whom PCP was an
early sign of the disease.
   In patients diagnosed in 1984 and 1985, just 42.7 percent
survived a year, the researchers said. By 1986 and 1987, the
one-year survival rate had risen to 54.5 percent.
   ``The gain in survival was observed in homosexual men and
intravenous drug users of both sexes, in all age and racial groups,
in all geographic regions, and in patients with or without'' other
diseases at the time, said the study's author, Dr. Jeffrey E.
Harris of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.
   ``Better diagnosis and treatment, particularly the introduction
of zidovudine, may have contributed to the decline in mortality,''
he wrote.

   Party animals along fraternity row at the
University of Mississippi have new neighbors _ Methodists carrying
a code of behavior.
   The university's Wesley Foundation, a United Methodist group,
started moving into the former Beta Theta Pi house last week.
   The white Beta Theta Pi fraternity was dissolved by Chancellor
Gerald Turner after two members were dumped nude Sept. 18 at black
Rust College in Holly Springs. Racial slurs had been scrawled on
their bodies.
   ``We're glad something positive has come out of something so
negative and unfortunate,'' said Kerby Bowling II, Beta Theta Phi
House Corporation president at the university.
   The Methodist group had been looking for a place to set up a
student center when Beta Theta Pi inquired in October, said Wade
Holland, the foundation's adviser and associate pastor of Oxford
University United Methodist Church.
   After two months of negotiations, Beta Theta Pi agreed to lease
the house to the foundation until May 1991, when the fraternity
will be eligible to reapply to organize at Ole Miss.
   Sixteen male students will live in the house. No alcohol will be
allowed. Visitation times for women will be set, too. Each resident
will be responsible for cleaning a section of the house.
   ``I made sure they understood this is not a fraternity,''
Holland said. ``It's a Christian environment. They must agree to
the standards before they can live in this place.''

<HEAD>Study: Women Without Symptoms can Spread Genital Herpes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most of the 30 million Americans who have genital
herpes probably will never know they are infected, researchers
believe, and a new study indicates that women without symptoms can
easily spread the disease.
   In the study, 27 women with genital herpes simplex virus
infections that produced recurrent sores underwent daily home tests
to detect whether they were giving off the virus even when they
didn't have sores.
   Though such viral ``shedding'' in the absence of symptoms has
been detected in previous studies of women with genital herpes,
never before has a study tried to determine how often it occurs,
authors of the study said.
   Subjects self-tested themselves at home at least three times a
week for three weeks, and the tests revealed that seven were giving
off virus, the researchers said. The ``shedding'' occurred during 1
percent of the total days on which home tests were performed, the
researchers reported.
   ``These data suggest that all women with recurrent genital
herpes simplex virus infection should be instructed about the
possible risk, albeit infrequent, of asymptomatically shedding
virus from the genital tract,'' the authors said in today's Journal
of the American Medical Association.
   Men also can spread the virus in the absence of sores, previous
studies have shown.
   All women who underwent the home test on more than 100 days were
found to be shedding virus on at least one occasion, and the same
was true of 80 percent of women who underwent tests on more than 50
days, the researchers said.
   The researchers said if tested frequently, ``probably all
women'' with recurrent genital HSV infection would shed the virus
even if they didn't have sores.
   Shedding was not related to age, contraceptive practices or
frequency of recurrence of genital sores, the researchers said.
   Nor did it occur more often in any one location on the genitals,
said the researchers, led by Brigit V. Brock and Dr. Lawrence Corey
of the University of Washington at Seattle.
   ``What's new is that they (the researchers) looked at the sites
of shedding in women,'' said Dr. Stephen Straus, head of medical
virology at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases in Bethesda, Md.
   ``And they looked a little better than those (who) had done so
previously in terms of how long you have to test a person before
you find it,'' he said in a telephone interview Thursday.
   Genital herpes, an incurable and lifelong infection that is
spread through sexual contact, lies dormant most of the time but
can erupt in painful sores or blisters.
   ``Existing data suggest that about two-thirds of people who have
been infected never know it,'' Straus said. ``When they transmit
it, that is of course asymptomatic.''
   Genital herpes is usually mild in adults, but each year 250 to
500 U.S. babies are born with severe herpes simplex 2 infections
they inherit from a parent, Straus said. Some of the babies have
severe developmental problems, he said.

<TEXT>
   Mayor Marion Barry, his last years in office
tarnished by accusations of drug use, was arrested on a narcotics
charge Thursday night in what federal authorities described as ``an
ongoing public corruption probe.''
   A federal law enforcement source said authorities had a
videotape of Barry smoking cocaine.
   Barry's arrest at a downtown hotel came just three days before
the mayor planned to formally announce that he would seek
re-election to a fourth term and a day before long-time Barry
associate Charles Lewis was scheduled for sentencing on drug
charges.
   Lewis testified in federal court that he provided cocaine for
the mayor, but it was not clear whether Thursday night's arrest was
connected to the Lewis investigation.
   Barry has steadfastly denied that he used drugs.
   The law enforcement source, who spoke on condition he not be
identified, said the probe was designed to catch Barry with an
illegal drug, and that authorities had Barry on film.
   The source said cocaine was seized from the hotel room but that
specific charges would not be lodged until the substance could be
analyzed. He said enough cocaine was seized to charge the mayor
with possession for personal use.
   The U.S. attorney's office said Barry would appear before a
federal magistrate for arraignment on drug charges Friday.
   A second federal law enforcement source said the arrest was the
result of as ``sting'' operation in which FBI agents observed a
prearranged meeting between the mayor and an unidentified friend in
a downtown hotel, the Vista International, about six blocks from
the White House.
   The undercover operation, which had been in place for several
weeks, involved setting up film equipment to photograph and record
the mayor in the hotel room, sources said.
   Barry, 53, was arrested at the hotel shortly after 8 p.m. as a
result of an undercover operation conducted jointly by the city
police department's internal affairs division and the FBI,
according to a statement by U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens and Thomas
DuHadway, special agent in charge of the FBI's Washington office.
There was no word of additional arrests.
   City police officers barred access to upper floors of the hotel
to all but guests. A dozen or so teen-agers mixed with reporters,
discussing the arrest, outside.
   A city official who asked not to be identified said Barry had no
events on his schedule at the hotel Thursday night.
   First word of the arrest was broadcast shortly after 10 p.m. by
television station WRC, which said the mayor attempted to buy
cocaine on the seventh floor.
   The mayor, the city's second under home rule, was led away by
undercover police officers and FBI agents, the station said, and
his driver and bodyguard were led away separately.
   Barry was taken to the FBI's national headquarters, said federal
sources who asked not to be identified. He returned to his home in
the Southeast section of the city after midnight, accompanied by
FBI agents and Herbert O. Reid, a long-time adviser and the city's
attorney,
   Barry, who has repeatedly won re-election with large majorities,
has lost support over the past four years because of allegations of
drug use and corruption convictions against several members of his
administration.
   Jesse Jackson fueled speculation that he would challenge Barry
when he moved to Washington last year. However, Jackson has said
repeatedly that he would not challenge Barry. Jackson said through
a spokesman he would have no comment on the arrest.
   Drug use among the city's young men is blamed for a sharply
rising murder rate _ a record 438 homicides were committed last
year against 369 the year before.
   Top city officials were meeting late Thursday night to assess
the arrest. City Council Chairman David Clarke, who is running for
mayor, called the arrest ``a tragic moment in our city's history.''
Councilwoman Charlene Jarvis, another mayoral candidate, said the
arrest ``changes the political landscape of the city.''
   Although rumors about Barry and drugs had surfaced throughout
the last half of his tenure as mayor, no charges had been brought
before Thursday.
   The accusations became even more widespread after the arrest of
Lewis.
   Barry was visiting Lewis' hotel room in December 1988 when city
police were sent to investigate a report that Lewis was selling
drugs. When the officers found out Barry was present, they
abandoned their mission in an episode not yet fully explained.
   Lewis pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute
cocaine in Washington, and was scheduled to be sentenced on that
charge Friday. Lewis also has been convicted of selling drugs in
the Virgin Islands.
   In November, WUSA-TV said a local physician had reported to
police that Barry had been treated for a drug overdose in 1983. The
then-police chief later reported that investigators were unable to
confirm that report.
   Karen Johnson, a former city worker with whom Barry eventually
admitted a romance, was convicted on various drug charges in 1984.
She served several months in prison for refusing to testify about
Barry.

<HEAD>Author Shrugs Off Controversy Over US-Japan Book</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Japanese legislator who wrote a book sharply
critical of American attitudes toward Japan shrugs off the
controversy it is stirring up in the United States.
   Americans may be unhappy, Shintaro Ishihara says, but the
controversy has been great for sales in Japan. Already, 500,000
copies of ``A Japan That Can Say `No''' have been snatched up and
he predicted sales will hit 1 million by spring.
   In an interview Thursday during a trip to Washington to try to
calm outraged U.S. policymakers, Ishihara rejected a suggestion
that his nationalistic views were out of the mainstream of Japanese
public opinion.
   ``I have many letters from my readers,'' he said. ``Many of them
are saying, `How come Americans get mad at those things that are so
ordinary that I read in your book?'''
   While no authorized version of Ishihara's book exists in the
United States, copying machines on Capitol Hill have been working
overtime to reproduce translations done by U.S. intelligence and
defense agencies.
   Portions of the book have even found their way into the
Congressional Record as congressional critics of Japan's trade
policies rushed to publicize what they say is a prime example of
Japan's arrogance in economic matters.
   In the book, Ishihara argues that Japan needs to be more
assertive in standing up to America. He brags about Japan's
technological superiority and calls America's military shield for
Japan an illusion. He complains that ``Americans behave more like
mad dogs than watch dogs,'' and he dismisses American criticism of
Japan as being racially motivated.
   In the part of the book that attracted the Pentagon's attention,
he warns that unless America reforms its policies toward Japan,
Tokyo might stop supplying the microchips needed to accurately
target U.S. nuclear missiles.
   Ishihara writes that Japan could sell the chips to the Soviets
instead in an action which ``would instantly change the balance of
military power.''
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Ishihara did not
recant any of his comments, but he maintained that the ``pirated''
version now in circulation in Washington leaves out certain
clarifying comments.
   He said he was working to bring out an authorized
English-language version of the book by April, although it will
lack the contributions of his Japanese coauthor, Sony Corp.
Chairman Akio Morita.
   Morita, who wrote several less inflammatory chapters of the
Japanese book, now says he regrets his involvement with the project.
   Ishihara said he intended for the book to stimulate an honest
dialogue between U.S. and Japanese policymakers at a time when
relationships between the two countries are in transition.
   ``We have come to a new era where a redefinition of the
U.S.-Japan relationship is called for,'' he said.
   He said he hoped to arrange a series of debates between members
of the Japanese parliament and the U.S. Congress after the upcoming
parliamentary elections in February.
   With Japan accounting for almost half of America's $111 billion
annual trade deficit, efforts to stem the flow of Japanese imports
and boost U.S. export sales are a prime topic in Congress with
various lawmakers urging retaliation against Japanese imports
unless the country buys more American products.
   Ishihara, a member of the conservative Liberal-Democratic Party,
was considered one of the frontrunners last year for the prime
minister's job which eventually went to Toshiki Kaifu.
   Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich., met with Ishihara and said afterward
he was not optimistic there will be any quick resolution to the
trade problems separating the two countries.
   He called Ishihara's views ``a minority point of view'' but one
which American policymakers ``need to take seriously and respond to
it.''

   U.S. warships off the coasts of Colombia are
unwanted and unneeded in the fight against drugs, says the
ambassador from that country.
   ``I don't think that the sending of vessels or troops to our
waters is necessary,'' Colombian Ambassador Victor Mosquera Chaux
said Thursday. ``I think U.S. naval forces could begin by trying to
control the entry of narcotics within their own waters.''
   ``I don't understand why there's so much insistence on military
operations when the Colombian military and police forces have shown
their capabilities,'' he said at a press conference.
   Ambassador Cesar Atala Nazal of Peru also said his country would
not accept U.S. troops for drug fighting within the country or U.S.
vessels in waters offshore ``because they are not necessary at
all.''
   But Atala dd not rule out limited use of U.S. ships and planes
for radar surveillance and aerial tracking.
   ``What we object to is unilateral decisions made by the United
States affecting the internal affairs of our country,'' he said.
   ``We would like to see what the points are, what the arguments
are, what the benefits would be, and you can be sure that the
Peruvian government will be absolutely understanding of the
arguments presented by the United States government and eventually
reach an agreement,'' he said.
   Defense Department sources said last week that the aircraft
carrier USS John F. Kennedy has been chosen to lead an interdiction
effort off the Caribbean coast of Colombia but that no final
decision had been made on deployment.
   Word of the proposed deployment touched off rumors that the
United States might try to blockade Colombia and there was outrage
from Latin American nations that were still angry over the U.S.
invasion of Panama.
   Atala, Mosquera and Bolivian Ambassador Jorge Crespo Velasco
appeared at the news conference after testifying before a joint
hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Senate Caucus on
International Narcotics.
   Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., has
proposed to offer South American countries debt relief in exchange
for concrete activity against the drug trade.
   Biden said he hoped the idea would appear on the agenda when the
leaders of the three countries and the United States hold their
drug summit in Colombia Feb. 15.
   Peruvian President Alan Garcia has said he will not attend the
meeting unless all the U.S. invasion forces are out of Panama.
   Biden expressed interest in a proposal by Peru's Atala and
endorsed by Bolivia's Crespo for the U.S. to help purchase the coca
leaf crop for a few years while farmers turn to other crops.
   Atala said Peruvian farmers ``would dream to be on the side of
the law'' even if it meant earning slightly less from other crops.
Payments to the farmers _ about $234 million for one year's worth
of crops _ would find their way into the economy as well, Atala
said at the hearing, noting that last year's drug-fighting aid
totaled $254 million.
   ``I am absolutely convinced that the farmers themselves would
profit by getting this money but working within the law rather than
continue being the victims of traffickers, the terrorists and the
Peruvian police,'' he said.

<HEAD>Many Soviet Emigres Will Have to Wait for Permission to Enter US</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Up to 400,000 Soviets may be asking to enter
the United States as refugees in the coming years, but at most only
10,000 will be allowed in this fiscal year, an immigration official
says.
   The rest will have to wait, despite some signs they may be in
danger of intimidation by Soviet authorities, the nation's top
immigration official said Thursday.
   Under an agreement between the administration and Congress,
50,000 Soviet refugees will be allowed into the United States in
the 1990 fiscal year that began Oct. 1. But 40,000 to 45,000 of
those slots will be used up by a backlog of Soviets waiting since
last year in transit in Italy, said Gene McNary, commissioner of
the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   The Rome channel was shut off by the Bush administration last
Oct. 1 under a new system that only allows Soviets to apply in
Moscow. But Attorney General Dick Thornburgh pledged to clear up
the backlog in Rome before closing down the transit facility.
   As many as 100,000 other applicants, most of them Jews, are
waiting in Moscow. McNary told reporters the INS has provided
300,000 additional application forms.
   Based on talks and impressions from a trip to Moscow last week,
McNary said it was difficult to determine whether applicants were
in danger of intimidation by Soviet authorities.
   ``By and large'' people are free to come to the U.S. Embassy and
present their applications, as evidenced by the long lines outside
the building, McNary said. ``But there are situations which would
indicate a well-founded fear of persecution.''
   The estimated 2.5 million Jews in the Soviet Union were for many
years subject to officially sanctioned anti-Semitism, banned from
practicing their religion and studying their language and history.
   The liberalized Soviet administration of President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev has banned anti-Semitism and lifted most restrictions on
the emigration of Jews and Evangelical Christians and Armenians.
But a State Department report several months ago found that
anti-Semitism among newly emerging nationalist groups has risen.
   After years of demanding that the Kremlin allow more Soviets to
leave, the United States now faces severe budget limits and more
Soviets seeking to enter the country than it can take in.
   More than 71,000 Jews left the Soviet Union last year, the
highest annual rate ever, and 36,147 of them came to the United
States as refugees. Refugee status means the federal government
pays for their travel and resettlement here, and recipients are
eligible to become citizens.
   McNary said he expects a possible increase in the number of
Armenians seeking refugee or asylum status in the United States as
a result of the violence against them in the Soviet republic of
Azerbaijan. Dozens of Armenians have been killed in the fighting,
which has escalated in recent days to civil war proportions.
   As many as 2,000 Armenians could be allowed into the United
States each month under a category known as humanitarian parole,
which entitles them to some federal assistance but not to automatic
citizenship. About 12,000 Armenians came here last year.
   McNary said the INS has increased its staff in Moscow to 24, and
has begun operating an office in suburban Washington to help in
processing the Soviet applications.
   McNary also said the INS had received 3,720 applications from
Chinese studying or working in the United States seeking permission
to stay here in light of the repression against the pro-democracy
movement in China. Most of the applications have been approved, he
said.

<HEAD>Researchers Say Asbestos Risks May be Overstated</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Concern about asbestos in schools and public
buildings may be overstated, suggests a group of researchers who
say there is little data showing that asbestos levels in such
buildings are a health hazard.
   The report by a group of scientists, as reported in Science
magazine, said that although most of the health concerns from
asbestos stem from studies involving occupational exposure, there
is no data to show similar risks to the general public exposed to
airborne asbestos.
   ``Surveys of asbestos in schools and public buildings show that
the mean airborne concentrations are several thousand times lower''
than in workplace environments that existed before asbestos was
strictly regulated, said the study.
   Asbestos, once widely used for insulation and other purposes,
has been shown to cause lung cancer; asbestosis, a scarring of the
lung; and mesothelioma, a cancer of the chest and abdomen. The
federal government has directed that schools inspect for asbestos
and develop plans to have it removed or enclosed so occupants will
not be exposed to airborne particles.
   The researchers _ three from the United States, one from
Scotland and one from France _ argue that most of the studies on
asbestos have involved asbestos miners and other workers routinely
exposed to the cancer-causing materal in the workplace.
   ``An important issue is whether these diseases are also hazards
to the general population exposed to airborne levels of asbestos in
schools and other buildings,'' said the researchers.
   The findings noted there are different forms of asbestos and
that each poses different health risks.
   ``The available data,'' said the report, ``do not indicate that
asbestos-associated malignancies or functional impairment will
occur as a result of exposure to most airborne concentrations of
asbestos in buildings.''
   The scientists said that even when asbestos-containing materials
in buildings are damaged, the levels of airborne asbestos normally
found ``are magnitudes lower than concentrations in the unregulated
workplace in the past.''
   Airborne asbestos levels found in schools and buildings normally
are no more than 1 percent of levels considered today to be
permissible in the workplace by the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration, the scientists said.
   Furthermore, said the scientists, ``with few exceptions the type
of asbestos fiber found predominantly in buildings is chrysotile.
Accumulating evidence indicates that this asbestos type is probably
not associated with the occurrence of mesotheliomas at low levels
of exposure.''
   The scientists said the rate of deaths from mesothelioma over
the past 10 to 20 years has been increasing among males over 65
years of age that have a past occupational history of exposure to
asbestos, but similar rates among females of all ages have declined
or remained constant.
   ``These results support the concept that asbestos in buildings
is not an important risk factor as one would expect increased
mesotheliomas in both males and females,'' said the study.
   The findings were authored by B.T. Mossman, of the University of
Vermont College of Medicine; J. Bignon a leading French medical
researcher; M. Corn, of Johns Hopkins University; A. Seaton,
director of the Institute of Occupational Medicine in Edinburgh,
Scotland; and J.B.L. Gee, of Yale University School of Medicine.

<HEAD>Documents Detail Noriega's Rise from Traffic Section to Dictator</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. intelligence officials have long known
Manuel Antonio Noriega was once relieved of his duties for
mistreating prisoners and was restricted to quarters as a junior
officer for drunk and disorderly conduct, documents show.
   The documents, released by the Defense Intelligence Agency in
response to a Freedom of Information Act request, provide details
of Noriega's rise through the Panamanian military, starting with
his education in Peru and Venezuela before 1962.
   But many details in the biographical reports were blacked out to
prevent public scrutiny.
   Noriega, who previously had helped U.S. intelligence agencies,
was ousted as Panama's dictator in the invasion by U.S. troops last
month. He is jailed in Miami on charges of drug trafficking.
   The DIA documents show Noriega was in trouble with the
Panamanian National Guard less than a year after he entered the
service on May 26, 1962.
   ``Thirty days restriction to quarters for drunk and disorderly
conduct, Jan. 1963,'' reads one item written when Noriega was a
second lieutenant assigned to Colon.
   After a stint in the traffic section in the town of David,
Noriega was put in charge of a detachment in the Bocas del Toro
Province on March 11, 1964.
   Less than a month later he encountered another problem.
   ``Temporarily relieved of duties for mistreatment of prisoners,
4-13 Apr 1964,'' the documents say.
   But Noriega returned to David to head the traffic section in
April 1964, and his association with the United States apparently
started the next year.
   In 1965, Noriega was selected to attend the jungle operations
course at the U.S. Army School of the Americas at Fort Gulick in
the Canal Zone.
   The school, now at Fort Benning, Ga., is considered a
prestigious assignment for up-and-coming Latin American military
officers, according to Maj. Jack Rail, a spokesman. Foreign nations
select the people they want to attend, he said.
   Rail said the school's records also show Noriega attending the
school in 1967.
   Before he was promoted to major, Noriega worked briefly as a
public relations officer.
   He then moved into intelligence work, serving as a member of the
counterintelligence and counterespionage organization in 1969-1970.
   He also served as a member of an arms purchasing commission that
visited France, Israel and possibly England in July 1970.
   From 1970 until 1981, Noriega was the assistant chief of G-2,
the intelligence unit. He was made a brigadier general on Aug. 1,
1983.
   Other DIA documents reveal that U.S. officials kept superiors
apprised of current information Noriega.
   Quoting the weekly newspaper, Quiubo, a DIA report said Noriega
was said to have received death threats from Colombian drug lords
because he was cooperating with U.S. drug enforcement agents.
   Noriega reportedly moved his headquarters to a ```super'
protected bunker with extremely limited access'' on the small
island of Naos alongside a causeway, the DIA report said in April
1986.
   The documents provide only a few personal details, such as
Noriega's birthday on Feb. 11, 1936.
   The report notes ``Noriega is a non-practicing Roman Catholic,
and is possibly a follower of the Rosicrucians and has studied
Buddhism.''
   Rosicrucians are followers of a group of 18th century
philosophers who claimed to have been deeply versed in the secrets
of nature.
   When Noriega's quarters were raided by U.S. troops in December,
American officials said they found items of voodoo apparatus.

<HEAD>Child Care Group: Anti-Abortion Lawmakers Have Chance to Recoup
Favor</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Anti-abortion members of Congress can regain
some of the favor they've lost with pro-choice voters by supporting
a $1.75 billion child care package, according to a child welfare
group.
   ``Here is an opportunity for candidates, including those
moderate Republicans who may be anti-choice, to be pro-women, to be
pro-family,'' Marian Wright Edelman, president of the Children's
Defense Fund, said Thursday.
   ``Parents overwhelmingly say they need it. ... In an election
year, it's going to be hard for any candidate to vote against it,''
said Mrs. Edelman.
   The Senate approved child care legislation last year by a 63-37
margin despite fierce opposition from the Bush administration and
the Senate GOP leadership.
   But the package was derailed in the House after Democratic
leaders failed to resolve a dispute among members of their own
party over spending levels.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., has pledged to make the
legislation a priority when Congress returns next week. Public
opinion polls indicate a large majority of Americans favor federal
aid for child care.
   The Children's Defense Fund supports a compromise worked out
last fall between Sens. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., and Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah, and Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif.
   The compromise would authorize an increase of $1.1 billion to
states for child care services, much of it in reimbursements to
low- and moderate-income families.
   It would also provide about $215 million for Head Start
pre-school programs and $435 million for public schools so half-day
child care programs could be expanded into all-day centers.
   The measure would be funded through the annual appropriations
process. Congress last year included $1.2 billion for the new
program, but it was stripped from the budget when lawmakers failed
to complete action on the authorization bill.
   A competing version by Democratic Reps. Tom Downey of New York
and George Miller of California offers an initial $200 million
through an expansion of block grant entitlements to states, with
the level increasing to $400 million in later years.
   Because those are entitlements, Congress would not have to
approve the funds each year.
   A key difference in the plans is an increase in tax credits for
working families that's included in the Downey-Miller version,
though supporters of the other plan have indicated they are willing
to include similar provisions.
   The projected tax credit for 1991, adjusted for inflation, is
expected to be about $1,000. The credit would be increased under
the Downey-Miller plan to $1,220 for families with one child;
$1,500 for families with two children; and $1,790 for three or more
children.
   It would also create a supplemental tax credit for families with
children under age 6. That credit would be about $430 in 1991.
   The tax credits would provide about $13.5 billion over five
years, according to the House Ways and Means staff.

<HEAD>Bush Wants $1.8 Billion Boost in Foreign Spending, Sources Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush wants to add $1.8 billion next
year to the government's international affairs spending, enough to
retain current aid to Israel and boost assistance for Eastern
Europe, congressional sources say.
   Bush will propose increasing this year's $16.6 billion in
outlays for foreign aid and other international operations to about
$18.4 billion for fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1. The proposal
will be included in the 1991 budget the president submits to
Congress on Jan. 29, the sources said.
   Spending on international affairs includes foreign aid, the
budgets of the State Department and U.S. Information Agency, and
participation in international organizations such as the United
Nations.
   It is a part of the budget that was frequently cut during the
Reagan administration years. It remains highly unpopular with many
members of Congress, who prefer to spend federal money on domestic
programs, and the increase could be difficult to win from lawmakers.
   ``It will be tough,'' said John Sewell, president of the
Overseas Development Council, a private think tank in Washington.
``But we're reaching the point where there are two options: start
cutting those items that are already in there, or start putting
some new resources in.''
   According to the sources, the increase would allow Israel and
Egypt, the two largest recipients of U.S. foreign aid, to avoid any
cuts in their assistance. Israel gets $3 billion annually from the
United States, while Egypt receives $2.1 billion.
   On Thursday, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin told
reporters he has been assured that foreign aid to his country will
not be cut next year.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., this week proposed
cutting assistance to all countries _ including Israel and Egypt _
so it could be redistributed to countries in Eastern Europe and
Central America. Dole proposed a 5 percent cut in aid to each
country, which he said would free $400 million for ``emerging
democracies.''
   When Dole discussed his plan with reporters, he said Bush had
been informed of his idea and that the president ``must've agreed
with it.''
   The boost would permit new assistance to Eastern European and
Central American countries, the sources said. They said it also
would allow the United States to pay the $700 million it owes the
United Nations for membership and peace-keeping expenses, and to
begin rebuilding a new embassy in Moscow. U.S. officials believe
the newly constructed embassy there is riddled with Soviet
listening devices.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they were
uncertain what assistance would be provided to the new
U.S.-installed government of Panama under the Bush plan. The
administration is expected to seek aid for Panama this fiscal year,
which runs through Sept. 30.

   A therapist defended her interviews of
alleged victims in the McMartin Pre-School molestation trial,
despite criticism by several jurors who said leading questions
undermined the prosecution's case.
   The jury on Thursday acquitted Raymond Buckey and his mother,
Peggy McMartin Buckey, of 52 child molestation counts and
deadlocked on 13 other counts.
   Therapist Kee McFarlane later defended her work with hundreds of
McMartin students, and suggested that the goals of therapy are at
odds with the legal standards required for a successful criminal
prosecution.
   ``What is in the interest of children is not always in the
interest of the legal system,'' she said.
   Evidence introduced by prosecutors in what became the longest
and most expensive criminal trial in U.S. history included
videotaped interviews of the alleged victims.
   Many of the interviews were conducted at an early stage of the
sexual abuse investigation by MacFarlane, a social worker and
director of the Child Sexual Abuse Center at Children's Institute
International.
   MacFarlane said Thursday she still believes children from the
school had been molested and that they had not fabricated their
accounts of abuse.
   ``This agency would never have gone all the way through what we
have if we did not believe these children,'' she said.
   At least seven jurors who attended a news conference agreed the
evidence showed children had been molested. But the jurors were
sharply critical of the interviewers' technique at the institute.
   ``The children were never allowed to say in their own words what
happened to them,'' said juror John Breese. ``All the questions
were leading.''
   ``If the CII tapes had not been entered into evidence and I had
not seen them, I could have believed the children a little more,''
juror Brenda Williams said.
   But MacFarlane said that the interviewing techniques were sound,
noting that small children must be interviewed differently than
adults.
   ``I didn't put words into their mouths,'' she said. ``I tried to
enable them to get over their fears.''
   MacFarlane acknowledged that some procedures could have been
done differently, including conducting more interviews over a
longer period of time. She called the outcome of the case a
``tragic consequence of an attempt to prevent trauma to these
children.''
   But the institute's executive director, Mary M. Emmons, said
some good may come out of the case.
   ``It has greatly increased the awareness about the issue of
child sexual abuse and about the problems of prosecuting these
cases,'' she said.

   Amid high popularity ratings for President
Bush and the Republicans, House Democratic leaders will hold a
secretive weekend retreat to ponder how to squeeze maximum media
advantage out of the congressional session that begins Tuesday.
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., will convene his
top lieutenants and about a dozen or so rank-and-file ``activist''
House Democrats on Saturday and Sunday at the Aspen Institute, a
conference center on Maryland's Eastern Shore, according to party
sources.
   Participants were reluctant to talk about the event or its
agenda Thursday, and Gephardt spokesman David Dreyer, who organized
the retreat, declined to discuss it.
   ``I just don't regard it as press business,'' Dreyer said.
``There are some things he (Gephardt) doesn't care to advertise.''
   Sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the meeting
will not involve legislative business or an agenda for the 1990
session of Congress. Those matters will be left to a retreat for
all House Democrats scheduled for Feb. 1-2 in Columbia, Md.
   Rather, the sessions will focus on how the party can be sold to
American voters. They will feature discussions by pollsters, media
consultants and outside analysts on topics such as, ``Effective
Message Making,'' ``Making the News and Deciding What's News,'' and
``Who is Our Audience?'' There will be a discussion on ``GOP
Message Strategy,'' and a wrapup session, ``Democratic Themes for
1990 and Beyond.''
   The polls operated by the three major television networks in
cooperation with major newspapers on Wednesday and Thursday
reported Bush's job approval rating anywhere from 71 percent to 79
percent, topping even the peaks of his predecessor, Ronald Reagan.
   The Washington Post-ABC News poll of 1,518 adults also showed
half of them most trust the Republican Party to cope with America's
problems, compared with 38 percent who believe the Democrats can do
a better job. All the polls had error margins of about 3 percentage
points either way.
   Most of those attending the weekend meeting near Queenstown,
Md., are Democrats who attend morning meetings in Gephardt's office
when Congress is in session, seeking to tailor a daily party line
for press consumption.
   The list of speakers and panelists includes some political
operatives who were with Gephardt's unsuccessful 1988 presidential
campaign, including pollster Ed Reilly and political consultants
David Doak and Bob Shrum.
   Also among speakers scheduled to appear are pollsters Harrison
Hickman, Tubby Harrison, Mark Mellman, Geoff Garin, Celinda Lake
and Stanley Greenberg; Paul Tully, political director of the
Democratic National Committee, and Mike McCurry, the DNC press
spokesman; and analysts Norman Ornstein and William Schneider of
the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington think tank.
   The list also includes Sidney Blumenthal, a Washington Post
reporter; Ken Bode, the former chief political correspondent for
NBC News and now a journalism educator; and political consultants
Bob Squier and Jim Carville.

<HEAD>First Lady Says Women Not Strong Enough for Combat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First lady Barbara Bush is softening the
``qualified yes'' she gave when asked if military women should be
allowed to serve in combat.
   She said in a radio interview with Mutual Broadcasting on
Thursday that women are not ``physically strong enough'' to go into
combat and their presence would cause morale and other problems.
   That differed from what she told news agency reporters Tuesday _
``a qualified yes'' _ when she said:
   ``If I thought a woman physically could pick up someone who was
wounded and carry them to safety, if I thought they could throw a
hand grenade as far a man, then I would say fine, because I think
certainly emotionally and mentally they are more than able to
compete with a man.''
   ``I'm sure they can shoot as well, they can fly as well,'' she
said in the earlier interview. ``The only problem I would have
would be if it risked somebody else's life because they couldn't
throw a hand grenade as far, or carry.''
   That answer put her at odds with Pentagon policy, which excludes
women from combat roles. However, in the U.S. invasion of Panama,
some women unexpectedly found themselves getting shot at and
shooting back.
   Mrs. Bush said Thursday, ``I wasn't clear'' in the earlier
interview.
   ``What I said was I don't think women are physically strong
enough. But it's much more complicated than that. There's a morale
problem, other problems.''
   ``I do not think a woman is as strong as a man. If you endanger
the lives of your buddies, then that just automatically rules it
out, forgetting morale problems and other problems that are very
important to the military.''

   President Bush's State of the Union address
will call for guaranteed pre-school programs for disadvantaged
children and requiring states to cut dropout rates in half by the
end of the decade, according to draft documents.
   Bush, who has said he wants to be the ``education president,''
and the nation's governors agreed in September at an education
summit to establish specific guidelines, with timetables, to
improve learning in the nation's schools.
   They have been hurriedly working on a consensus in preparation
for Bush's State of the Union on Jan. 31 and the National
Governors' Association meeting in February.
   In a memo obtained Thursday by The Associated Press, Bush's
domestic policy adviser, Roger Porter, said specific objectives
backing up the goals will be announced and approved during the Feb.
25-27 NGA convention.
   ``I believe that we have satisfied the criteria we set for
ourselves of producing goals that are limited in number, memorable,
measurable, ambitious, and yet realistic,'' Porter told Govs. Bill
Clinton of Arkansas and Carroll Campbell of South Carolina in his
memo.
   ``These goals are ambitious, yet they can and must be
achieved,'' said the draft memo. ``However, they cannot be achieved
by our education system as presently constituted. Substantial, even
radical changes will have to be made.''
   According to the documents, the national goals will focus on six
key areas, all targeting measurable progress to the year 2000. The
areas are: school readiness, student achievement, international
performance, high school completion, adult literacy and lifelong
learning, and safe, disciplined and drug-free schools.
   Specifics goals include:
   _Making sure all disadvantaged 4-year-olds have access to
pre-school programs that help prepare them for school and that they
have the nutrition and health care needed to arrive at school
healthy.
   _Requiring each state to reduce its dropout rate by at least
half, on average, and making sure that 75 percent of those students
who drop out of school will successfully complete a high school
degree or its equivalent.
   _Cutting by at least half the gap in high school graduation
rates between American students from minority backgrounds and their
non-minority counterparts.
   _Tripling the percentage of high school students who complete a
rigorous curriculum including proficiency in English, mathematics,
science, history, geography, foreign languages, and computer
sciences.
   _Increasing the number of qualified teachers in mathematics and
science.
   Also to be recommended will be a National Panel on Education
Performance, which will report annually on progress toward the
goals, overseeing development of new measures and revising goals
and objectives if justified, the document said.
   The governors also are working with the administration and
Congress to develop more regulatory flexibility.
   The final phase of the government's program _ accountability by
the federal government, the states and all in the education system
_ will be developed over the next few months in time for the NGA's
annual meeting in July.

   A convicted burglar who told police he
left his house-arrest program out of boredom landed back in jail
after a woman caught him inside her home, playing Nintendo on the
television, authorities said.
   Police also charged Kelly Lee Hardyman, 19, with breaking into
another house earlier Thursday, and said he played a Nintendo game
there, too. Police said he took small amounts of money in each
break-in.
   Susan Kirkland said she stopped in her home on the lunch hour
and came face to face with the burglar.
   ``I yelled at him and said, `Just get out of here,''' said Ms.
Kirkland, 38.
   The suspect ran out the front door, with Ms. Kirkland after him.
Neighbors and passersby joined the chase, and Hardyman was caught,
police said.
   Hardyman has a history of burglary convictions, but not of
violence, police said. He has been serving a house-arrest sentence,
and he told officers he committed burglaries partly because he was
bored, said Cpl. Joe Steins of the Gainesville Police Department.

<HEAD>ATF Will Review Petition to Ban Assault Pistols</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal firearms official says the
administration will consider whether to ban imports of
semiautomatic assault-style pistols, but says there aren't that
many coming into the country.
   Handgun Control Inc. petitioned for a ban on pistol imports as
semiautomatic assault-style rifle imports were barred last July,
contending the pistols are being imported in ``significant
numbers.''
   The Washington Post also reported the Treasury Department's
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms approved a permit last fall
for Heckler &amp; Koch of West Germany to send 10,000 of its SP-89
semiautomatic pistols into the United States.
   ``I don't know where these numbers are coming from,'' ATF
spokesman Jack Killorin said Thursday. ``The actual number of
imports are not anywhere near the numbers being mentioned.''
   The ATF cannot release specific import figures for the previous
12 months because they are considered proprietary information, said
Killorin. But he provided general information on all the styles of
semiautomatic assault-style pistols.
   ``There's a total of several thousand that have been actually
imported over a three-year period,'' he said. ``Without identifying
it, one of the firearms mentioned appears not to have been imported
since 1987. The total quantity reported to have been imported into
the United States is 50.''
   Killorin said the ATF studied the pistols last year when it
reviewed imports of semiautomatic assault-style rifles, including
the popular AK-47 model used by drifter Patrick Purdy to kill five
children and wound 29 others and a teacher at a Stockton, Calif.,
elementary school Jan. 17, 1989.
   The ATF in July banned imports of 43 types of semiautomatic
assault-style rifles, but decided to let the handgun imports
continue, he said.
   ``We looked at them in line with the law and we approved the
guns,'' he said.
   Killorin said the agency would examine the issues raised by the
Handgun Control petition filed Wednesday. He said he could not
predict when the study would be completed.
   The petition names five models _ the Heckler &amp; Koch and Uzi
pistols similar to rifles already banned, the Australian Automatic
Arms SAP pistol, the F.I.E. Spectre P pistol and the Sterling Mark
7 pistol.
   ``All of the factors which ATF considered persuasive in banning
the importation of semiautomatic assault rifles are present and
applicable to semiautomatic assault pistols,'' the petition said.
   But Killorin said banning the pistol imports would be much more
difficult than banning the rifle imports, although all firearms
imports must meet the test that they be suitable for sporting
purposes.
   The handguns passed all the regulations in place since the Gun
Control Act of 1968, which focused on keeping out cheap Saturday
Night Specials, he said. The rifles represented a relatively new
technology not covered by extensive legislative history that
centered on handguns, and therefore the ATF had more leeway to ban
them, he said.
   ``The object of what we do is to fairly and reasonably enforce
the law and to reasonably interpret what the law means through
regulation,'' Killorin said.
   ``What we cannot do is we cannot, through regulation, rewrite
the law,'' he said. ``The writing and passing of laws is the
business of elected officials, the president and Congress.''

<HEAD>Study Says Big Investors Would Gain Most in Tax Cut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new congressional study estimates less than
10 percent of President Bush's proposed capital gains tax cut would
go to occasional investors, including those who once in a lifetime
sell a family farm or business.
   More than 81 percent of the benefit would be reaped by those who
are likely to report capital gains in three or more of every five
years, according to an analysis by the staff of the Joint Committee
on Taxation.
   Rep. Byron L. Dorgan, D-N.D., a House Ways and Means Committee
member who opposes a capital gains cut, said the report ``explodes
the myth perpetrated by President Bush that his proposal is a tax
cut for middle-income families and designed to help those who sell
a farm or business they've held for 20 years.''
   Mark Bloomfield, executive director of the American Council for
Capital Formation, a business group that supports a capital gains
cut, said the study does not refute arguments for a reduction.
   ``Our point is that there are middle-class people who
periodically do realize capital gains and the tax system considers
them rich every year by the way it taxes them,'' Bloomfield said.
``That is not right.''
   The new analysis of Internal Revenue Service data found 58.9
percent of capital gains recorded in a five-year period were
reported by people who had gains every year. More than 81 percent
of the profits were reported by taxpayers who had gains in at least
three of the five years.
   By contrast, 9.8 percent of the gains were collected by those
who reported gains in only one of the five years, including those
whose only capital gains were profits from the sale of a home, farm
or business.
   ``Among taxpayers who realized gains in the period 1979 through
1983, a substantial number of taxpayers (43.7 percent) realized
one-time, or non-recurring, gains,'' the committee staff concluded.
``However, in dollar value, the bulk of realizations were
undertaken by taxpayers who were repeatedly in the market.''
   The analysis seeks to answer the question of who would actually
benefit from cutting the tax on capital gains, which are profits
from the sale of stock and other investments.
   Democrats cite estimates that 80 percent of the benefit would go
to those with total incomes more than $100,000 a year. Republicans
say it is misleading to list someone as having an over-$100,000
income when a person, for instance, earns $30,000 a year but sells
a family business for a $100,000 profit.
   Bush, who will renew his call for a capital gains reduction in
the budget he sends to Congress Jan. 29, criticized opponents of
the cut in a speech earlier this month. ``I am sick and tired of
the demagogues who call this a tax cut for the rich. It means jobs,
it means savings and it is good for all Americans,'' he said.
   The congressional study found people with non-capital gains
income under $20,000 filed 28 percent of the returns on which gains
were reported but had only 20 percent of the dollar value of the
gains. Even the 20 percent figure was distorted, the report stated,
because it included people whose taxable incomes were less than
zero due to a business or farm loss or a tax shelter.
   Since enactment of the 1986 landmark tax overhaul, capital gains
have been fully taxed at the same rates that apply to other income.
Bush wants to exclude as much as 30 percent of capital gains from
taxation, which would mean such profits would be taxed at lower
rates than apply to wages.
   The House, over objections of Democratic leaders, approved a
reduction last year in the capital gains tax. Democratic leaders
blocked a cut in the Senate, although a majority of senators
favored it.

   A Democratic women's political organization
says its survey shows 1990 should be a strong year for women who
run for public office and take a liberal position on abortion.
   The survey released Thursday by EMILY's List shows pro-choice
candidates would be generally favored over anti-abortion
candidates, if all other circumstances in the elections were equal.
   The survey showed the biggest advantage for those favoring
liberal stances on abortion would be in when a hypothetical
pro-choice Democratic married woman is matched against a
``pro-life'' Republican married man. The findings showed a 12-point
advantage for the woman in such a contest, the widest spread of any
of the combinations used in the poll.
   EMILY's List president Ellen Malcolm called the results ``a key
to electing more Democratic women, which is not an easy task.''
   The poll said that when marital status and sex were not
specified, ``pro-choice'' Democrats would have a 10-point advantage
over ``pro-life'' Republicans. EMILY's List said it used the terms
``pro-choice'' and ``pro-life'' in the survey because of the strong
images they present and because of the likelihood that candidates
would use one of the terms to describe themselves.
   The survey was designed to single out the impact of the abortion
issue on elections and so the only information given to respondents
about hypothetical candidates was their position on abortion, party
affiliation, sex and marital status.
   EMILY's List is a political network, founded in 1985, that
raises money and identifies political opportunities for Democratic
women. Its name is an acronym for ``early money is like yeast'' _
that is, it makes the dough rise.
   Release of the group's survey coincided with a meeting of the
National Republican Committee. The GOP debate over the abortion
issue was highlighted Thursday when a member who tried to introduce
a resolution reaffirming the party stand against abortion was told
he was out of order.
   Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater was expected to
dedicate a good portion of his speech at today's session to how
candidates should handle the issue.
   Democratic candidates who took strong pro-choice stands won
statewide races in Virginia and New Jersey in 1989 and Republican
leaders said they would try to recapture disaffected voters by
saying the GOP was ``a big tent'' with room for both views.
   But that stance has alienated some conservatives, who applauded
the party's strong platform position and President Bush's vetoes
last year of bills over abortion provisions.
   The EMILY's List poll showed the GOP's division on the issue
hurt pro-choice Republicans. They fared ``less well overall'' than
hypothetical pro-choice Democrats because they lost the Republican
conservative base.
   But pro-choice Republicans did well when paired in the poll
against anti-abortion Democrats.
   ``Republican candidates who are pro-choice have a 5-point
advantage over Democratic candidates who are `pro-life,''' said
Celinda Lake of Greenberg-Lake The Analysis Group Inc., which
conducted the poll.
   The telephone survey was conducted from Dec. 12-16, 1989, among
810 randomly selected registered voters. Each state was represented
in proportion to its share of the nation's population.
   The margin of error for the poll was plus or minus 3.5
percentage points, said Lake.
   A sample of 200 Hispanic voters surveyed for EMILY's List found
37 percent supported keeping abortion legal under all circumstances
and 51 percent under certain circumstances. Twelve percent were
against legalized abortion.
   She said that 68 percent of those questioned in the overall
survey believe parental consent should be given before minors can
get an abortion and 27 percent oppose such a requirement.

Twist</HEAD>

   Foreign aid keeps growing. So do the
complaints.
   About $371 billion has been dispersed since the end of World War
II _ a lot of money, by any yardstick. So is the $14.6 billion in
economic and military assistance Uncle Sam is delivering this year.
   That amounts to about $60 per American.
   Compare foreign aid spending to the $300 billion the Pentagon
gets this year for its weapons programs and other operations. It's
about 4.7 percent.
   Or compare foreign aid to the total U.S. budget of more than
$1.2 trillion. It amounts to 1.2 percent.
   Almost every year Congress calls for cuts in foreign aid. The
twist this time is a proposal by Senate Republican Leader Robert
Dole of Kansas to redirect $400 million to Eastern Europe and
Panama at the expense of some current recipients.
   That has made Israel very nervous as it tries to keep pace with
arms shipments to Arab enemies while settling an extraordinary
influx of Soviet Jews that could total 500,000 over the next three
years.
   Israel is the largest recipient of U.S. aid _ $1.8 billion in
military help and $1.2 billion in economic assistance. Some of the
other favored nations, Egypt, Turkey, Pakistan and the Philippines,
are quieter about Dole's proposal, but probably anxious as well.
   Dole appeared to have support from the Bush administration. The
State Department was quick to endorse the concept of
``flexibility'' in providing aid, although officials stressed that
Israel and other favored nations were not being targeted.
   But on Thursday word spread on Capitol Hill that President Bush
actually would ask Congress to boost spending on foreign aid and
other international operations by about $1.8 billion next year.
   And Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin left town after talks
with Bush administration officials saying he had ``reason to
believe'' U.S. assistance to his country would hold steady at $3
billion through 1991.
   It is not clear what the White House is up to by seeming to
encourage Dole while developing its own plan to increase foreign
aid.
   Still, the problems Dole touched on _ budget strictures and a
desire to help Eastern Europeans as they make a painful adjustment
to capitalist economies _ are real.
   Prodded by Congress, the president last year agreed to allocate
$553 million in aid this year to Poland and Hungary, the first
breakaway countries. Czechoslovakia, Romania, East Germany and
Bulgaria are following in their footsteps.
   ``To me,'' Dole said Tuesday, ``it boils down to this: Are big
gains for freedom worth a small cut in a few huge aid programs? I
say yes.''
   But there is another view: Find the money someplace else, such
as at the Pentagon where billions are spent on weapons that quickly
become obsolete. Some are faulty from the start. And Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's efforts to reduce tensions in
Europe may be making others wasteful.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, attacking Dole's plan, said that
rather than cutting funds to close allies ``let's find more money
for democracy in costly, unnecessary weapons programs like SDI (the
space-based Strategic Defense Initiative), the B-2 bomber and the
mobile MX missile.''
   Traditionally, American presidents embrace foreign aid and
dutifully take on congressional skeptics.
   Back in 1974, for instance, Richard M. Nixon said the $4.1
billion he proposed to spend on economic aid would be useful
``building sound foundations for a durable peace.''
   Three years later, Gerald R. Ford asked Congress for $4.7
billion in military and economic aid so the United States could
``take the lead in creating conditions which will insure justice,
international cooperation and enduring peace.''
   When Congress comes back next week, however, some of the members
are bound to express a contrary view. And the battle over foreign
aid will be on.

   President Bush, invoking memories of the 1988
campaign, has his biggest thanks for campaign loyalists ``for one
thing you did not ask me to do.''
   ``You never asked me to make a video riding in a tank,'' Bush
told a boisterous crowd of 2,000 at a Bush-Quayle campaign reunion
Thursday night.
   The joke, a reference to a much ridiculed Michael Dukakis pose
in a tank, set the tone for the GOP partisans who cheered Bush,
Vice President Dan Quayle, Republican Party chairman Lee Atwater
and the brain trust of the 1988 Bush victory drive.
   ``I'm sorry if I'm late,'' Bush quipped. ``The 18-wheeler got a
flat. Then I got tangled up in the flag and the metal detector got
set off by a silver foot. Doesn't it all come back to you now?''
   Bush took to driving a tractor-trailer in New England to smite
his patrician image after he got clobbered in the Iowa caucuses. He
made the flag a theme of his campaign, and Texan Ann Richards poked
fun at him at the Democratic convention by saying he was born with
``a silver foot in his mouth.''
   ``The toughest part for me was the debates. Some time has passed
so I want to recognize my opponent,'' Bush said. ``He was strong,
tough, tenacious and a real fighter, and I gained a newfound
respect for Dan Rather.''
   Bush squared off with Rather in a contentious interview early in
the campaign when the CBS anchorman sought to pin the then-vice
president down on his knowledge of the Iran-Contra affair.
   The reunion brought together the principals of the Bush
campaign, with the exception of Secretary of State James A. Baker
III, its chairman. Atwater said Baker isn't doing political events
these days.
   Two Cabinet members, Nicholas Brady of Treasury and Robert
Mosbacher of Commerce, were on hand.
   Saturday is the first anniversary of Bush's inauguration.
   Of his running mate, Quayle, Bush said, ``Nobody took more heat
and did a better job for our ticket and our election than you.''
   The vice president, for his part, joked, ``It's hard to believe
that it's been over a year since George Bush rode to victory on my
coattails.''
   Turning to Ailes, the campaign media strategist, Bush cracked,
``Some say it was Roger Ailes who gave me a personality. He made me
seem more decisive. I'm not sure about that. Maybe I am, maybe I'm
not.''
   Earlier Thursday, in a more sober-sided appearance at
Constitution Hall, Bush told his Cabinet and 2,000 top appointees
that ``all America has triumphed'' in his first year in office.

   Here is a chronology of events of the
political career of District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry:
   1974: Barry, a former black militant, is elected to the D.C.
City Council.
   1976: Barry is re-elected to the council.
   March 9, 1977: Hanafi Muslims shoot Barry in the chest during
their seizure of the District Building. The bullet barely misses
Barry's heart, but he's back at work a week later.
   Jan. 21, 1978: Barry announces his intention to run for mayor of
the nation's capital.

percent of the vote over two opponents, incumbent Mayor Walter
Washington and City Council President Sterling Tucker.
   Nov. 7, 1978: Barry is elected mayor.
   Jan. 2, 1979: Barry is inaugurated; pledges that ``here in
Washington D.C., we will be our brother's keeper.'' During his
first term, the city deficit mushrooms, forcing Barry to cut jobs
and services and press for more federal aid. He weathers a major
snowstorm and a drawn-out teacher's strike.
   1982: Barry is re-elected. His second term sees improved fiscal
health, renewal of the downtown area, a decline in unemployment and
crime and growing crowding of the city's jails and prisons.
Scandals begin to take their toll as 10 top city officials are
convicted of various financial crimes.
   Sept. 25, 1983: Barry is stricken with chest pains while
attending a meeting in a downtown hotel; hospital officials blamed
the episode on a hiatal hernia. A physician not involved in his
treatment tells police the mayor suffered a drug overdose, a report
not revealed for six years. Police then say they could find no
evidence for the physician's statement.
   Nov. 4, 1986: Despite his mounting troubles, Barry is re-elected
to an unprecedented third term, taking 61 percent of the vote.
   Jan. 2, 1987: Barry is inaugurated.

briefly after suffering chest pains, later explained as a flare-up
of the hiatal hernia.
   Jan. 30, 1987: The mayor is still on the West Coast when
back-to-back snowstorms hit Washington, paralyzing the city. He
decides to attend the Super Bowl rather than return to direct the
cleanup effort.
   Apr. 16, 1987: Barry defends the city ambulance system after
eight people die in six months following the slow arrival of
ambulances.
   May 22, 1987: U.S. Attorney Joseph diGenova announces federal
probe into allegations of fraud in city government.
   June 18, 1987: Barry denies a local television station's report
that he used cocaine with a former city employee.
   Dec. 22, 1988: Police officers planning to attempt a drug buy
from Charles Lewis, a former Virgin Islands official and
acquaintance of Barry's, are called back when it's discovered that
the mayor is in Lewis's hotel room. Traces of cocaine are found in
the room.
   Dec. 29, 1988: U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens announces plans to
investigate Lewis episode.
   Dec. 31, 1988: Barry apologizes for ``bad judgment'' in the
incident.
   Jan. 5, 1989: A grand jury investigating Barry's alleged
interference into police drug probe has subpoenaed the mayor's
telephone logs.

   Jan. 11, 1989: City Council member Betty Ann Kane calls for
council investigation into a joint personnel project involving the
Virgin Islands government on which Lewis worked as a consultant to
the city.
   Jan. 12, 1989: The FBI joins the probe into the Lewis episode.
   Jan. 19, 1989: Barry appears under subpoena before the grand
jury and testifies for three hours. He tells reporters he has done
nothing wrong.

counts of possession of cocaine.
   May 15, 1989: Lewis is indicted in Washington on 16 cocaine and
perjury charges.
   Sept. 17: Barry responds to hecklers at an outdoor festival by
making an obscene hand gesture.
   Nov. 6: Lewis pleads guilty in a plea bargain to two counts of
conspiring to distribute cocaine and names Barry as a person for
whom he bought crack cocaine while staying at the hotel where Barry
visited him in 1988.
   Nov. 27, 1989: A local television station reports that the 1983
hernia episode was reported to police as a drug overdose; police
say they investigated at the time but found no substantiation.

   Hundreds of Soviet Moslems crossed the
border between Iran and the troubled Soviet republic of Azerbaijan,
the largest number to cross in one day since protests and ethnic
violence broke out along the frontier this month.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said 430 Soviet
Azerbaijanis returned from visits to Iran Thursday after scores of
their Iranian relatives staged a four-hour farewell ceremony. IRNA
also said dozens of Azerbaijanis crossed into Iran.
   The Soviet Union has dispatched thousands of troops to try to
quell the fighting between the Shiite Moslem Azerbaijanis and the
Christian Armenian minority.
   The Soviets boarded two boats for the trip across the Araks
river that forms the border. They spent two days in Iran, IRNA
said, returning with copies of the Koran, prayer books, pictures of
the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and other souvenirs.
   ``Both hosts and guests vociferously cried `Allahu Akbar!' _
`God is great!,''' IRNA said.
   Tehran Radio said dozens of arriving Azerbaijanis chanted
Islamic slogans as they crossed into Iran to visit their ethnic
brethren. They share a common language, culture and religion.
   The number arriving in Iran Thursday was not specified.
   The report said Soviet and Iranian border guards who watched the
crossing took no action to stop the Azerbaijanis.
   The radio did not specify how the Azerbaijanis crossed into
Iran, but it has reported daily on Soviet Moslems swimming across
the Araks river this month for short visits.
   The ethnic clashes were preceded by the Dec. 31 demonstrations,
when hundreds of Soviet Moslems gathered on the bank of the Araks
demanding an open border and free trade with their Iranian brethren.
   There have been almost daily protests along the border, but IRNA
said the state of emergency apparently prevented the gathering
Thursday.
   Iran has said it welcomes any Soviet Moslems who wish to visit.
   The violence in the Caucasus is rooted in a historical animosity
between the Soviet Azerbaijanis and Armenians over who should
control the mostly Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. The region
has been part of the Azerbaijani republic since 1923.
   While many countries have backed Moscow's decision to send in
troops to put down the violence, an Iranian newspaper deplored such
action, IRNA reported.
   It quoted the Farsi-language daily Abrar as saying that ``the
deployment of Soviet forces in Azerbaijan is a development capable
of gradually changing the situation there into a tinder box ready
to explode in the future.''
   The daily warned that ``any indiscreet handling of the situation
by the Soviet government may very well rouse 1 billion sympathetic
Moslems throughout the world.''

<HEAD>Former Politician Convicted in Lockheed Scandal Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Political veteran Tomisaburo Hashimoto, a powerful
figure in Japan's governing party who was convicted in the Lockheed
bribery scandal, died today, a hospital official said. He was 88.
   The official at Tokyo hospital said Hashimoto died of pneumonia.
   During the 1964-1972 administration of late Prime Minister
Eisaku Sato, Hashimoto served in such key posts as
secretary-general of the governing Liberal Democratic Party,
construction minister and transport minister.
   In 1976, while transport minister, he was arrested on charges of
accepting $34,000 for promoting sales of aircraft by Lockheed Corp.
of the United States to a Japanese airline.
   The Tokyo District Court later sentenced him to a 2{-year jail
term. Hashimoto, who denied the bribery charges, took his case to
the Supreme Court, but the court has not yet issued a ruling.
   The Lockheed scandal erupted in 1976 when the U.S. aircraft
maker acknowledged it had bribed Japanese officials to influence
their decisions on plane purchases. The scandal was the worst up to
that time in Japan's postwar history and caused a split in the
Liberal Democrats that took several years to repair.
   Hashimoto, a native of Ibaraki prefecture northeast of Tokyo,
joined the Asahi Shimbun, a major Japanese newspaper, in 1927 after
graduating from the Department of Politics and Economics at Waseda
University.
   He quit the newspaper company after World War II and won his
first election to the nation's lower house of Parliament in 1949.
Hashimoto returned to the House of Representatives 12 times before
he lost in general elections in 1980.
   He served as construction minister from July to December 1960 in
the late Hayato Ikeda's Cabinet.
   Hashimoto also acted as secretary-general in the Cabinet of
former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka, who governed from July 1972 to
December 1974. Tanaka, who was also implicated in the Lockheed
scandal, is still appealing his case to the Supreme Court.
   There was no immediate word on survivors or funeral arrangements.

<HEAD>Grandson Searches for Gold Cache That Cost a Life</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUZANNE GAMBOA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WHITE SANDS MISSILE RANGE, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   According to the legends
it was the riches produced by Spanish miners, or the war loot of an
Apache chief. Some say the government spirited it away before the
area was cleared for bombing practice.
   Few have seen the gold cache said to be beneath Victorio Peak _
but one man has died over it.
   The grandson of that man has marshaled a team of engineers and
geologists, and convinced a wealthy Californian to invest $2
million, in a renewed search for an American ``el dorado'' said to
be worth $3 billion.
   Terry Delonas, 41, is the grandson of Milton E. ``Doc'' Noss,
who claimed he found the gold stacked in an underground cavern in
1937 while hunting with his wife, Ova. Noss said it was sealed in
the cave when he tried to blast a wider entrance with dynamite.
   Three official searches since then have come up empty-handed,
but Delonas, who took a group of journalists on a tour of the area
Thursday, said he plans to begin searching again in April.
   He is determined to save his dead grandfather's honor, Delonas
said, for there are those who say Noss was a con-man.
   He died in 1949, shot to death by Charlie Ryan in an argument
over money Ryan had invested in the search for the cache. Ryan was
acquitted on grounds of self-defense.
   Aaron Kin, a 26-year-old Beverly Hills, Calif., real estate
developer who is bankrolling the dig, seems relaxed about the
venture.
   For one thing, he believes he could recoup the investment
without even finding the gold.
   ``We've got other directions to go as far as a movie to the
story. There's other avenues besides the gold outlet,'' he said.
   Besides, Kin said, ``The amount of work that was put into this
project tells me that these people wouldn't be doing this unless it
was true.''
   Letha Guthrie, the 74-year-old daughter of Ova Noss, claims to
have handled several gold ingots and artifacts that Noss brought
from the cavern and hid in the desert.
   The Army has denied rumors that the federal government found and
removed the gold years ago.
   Delonas said three previous excavations were not as well
financed, were too short, and lacked cooperation from the Army.
Ground radar used in the latest, 1977 search, showed a large cavern
under the peak, he said.
   Delonas' group has a 365-day contract with the Army to search in
the southcentral New Mexico preserve. An amendment to the 1989
Defense Authorization Act allows the Noss family heirs to dig for
the treasure. The area has been closed to the public since 1955.
   The excavators must leave the peak during target practice and
missile firings, White Sands spokesman Jim Eckels said. Any cost to
the Army, such as military police escorts, will have to be paid by
the Noss family.
   Delonas said he is conducting the treasure hunt in memory of his
grandmother, who died in 1979 telling her grandson to carry on.
   But he admitted wanting a little more than family honor.
   ``Certainly with the money and effort we've put into it, we'd
like to have some monetary reward,'' he said.

   Frustrated by Ulysses S. Grant's refusal to
pose for a portrait, a Swiss artist commissioned to glorify the
Union triumph in the Civil War decided instead to paint Grant's old
nemesis, Robert E. Lee, in a daring gesture of spite.
   The long-forgotten oil painting by flamboyant artist Frank
Buchser spent the next 120 years gathering dust in a museum in his
native Switzerland _ until it was found by Swiss Ambassador Edouard
Brunner and brought back to the United States last year.
   Tonight, on the 184th anniversary of Lee's birth, Brunner will
unveil the newly restored portrait of the Confederate general at an
embassy reception attended by alumni of Washington and Lee
University in Lexington, Va.
   Lee was president of Washington College in Lexington for five
years after his April 9, 1865, surrender to Grant at Appomattox
ended the Civil War. The institution was renamed in Lee's honor
after his death in 1870.
   Brunner obtained the portrait on permanent loan from the Swiss
National Museum in Bern to the embassy in Washington. It is the
last portrait of Lee to be painted from life, and one of only three
for which Lee ever posed.
   Lee, who rarely consented to pose even for photographers,
relented to the charming Buchser's entreaties. He sat for the
painter for three weeks in the fall of 1869, about a year before he
died.
   Lee refused to wear his old Confederate commander-in-chief's
uniform, saying ``I am a soldier no longer,'' and posed instead in
the black broadcloth suit he had worn at his son's wedding.
   Buchser, however, persuaded Lee to sit next to a table where the
artist had arranged the former general's hat, binoculars, and the
sword, belt, sash and uniform coat that Lee had worn at Appomattox.
   Buchser had been commissioned by a group of Swiss liberals who
admired the Union cause in the Civil War and wanted portraits of
Northern heroes, including Grant, to hang in the Swiss parliament
in Bern.
   When Grant repeatedly refused to pose, Buchser painted Lee's
portrait in the hope he could persuade Grant to change his mind.
Grant never consented, but the Lee painting _ though unpopular with
Buchser's patrons who refused to pay for it _ came to be regarded
as Buchser's finest portrait and went on permanent display at the
Bern museum.
   A known brawler and womanizer who sported a 12-inch waxed
mustache, Buchser arrived in Lexington unannounced, but quickly won
Lee's confidence and captivated his wife and daughters with his
hand-kissing European manners and his lively performances on the
guitar and piano.
   Buchser soon embraced Lee as a father figure. ``What a gentle,
noble soul, how kind and charming the old white-haired warrior
is,'' the artist wrote in his diary.
   When he returned to Europe, Buchser declared that Lee was ``the
ideal of American democracy.'' The artist even grew a beard and
trimmed his mustache to look like Lee.
   During their hours together, Lee shared his private thoughts
with Buchser in a way he rarely did with others.
   According to the artist's diary, Lee praised former Confederate
president Jefferson Davis for his character but called him ``one of
the extremest politicians.'' Lee also made unflattering comments
about Grant's skills as a military tactician.
   One of the two other life portraits of Lee was painted by an
obscure artist in 1833 when Lee was a young, mutton-chopped
lieutenant with the U.S. Army engineers. It hangs in the crypt of
Lee Chapel on the W&amp;L campus where Lee is buried.
   The other portrait, painted in 1853 by another little-known
artist, shows Lee as superintendent of the U.S. Military Academy at
West Point, N.Y. That painting hangs in the home of Lee's
granddaughter, Mrs. William Hunter de Butts, in Upperville, Va.
   Brunner said he brought the Lee portrait to Washington to join
another Buchser portrait of Union Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman at
the ambassador's residence here. Both belong to the Swiss
government, he said, and will remain at the embassy.

<HEAD>Dollar, Yen Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose against the Japanese yen today, and
share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rebounded moderately after
three consecutive days of decline.
   The dollar closed at 146.33 yen, up 0.67 yen from Thursday's
close of 145.66 yen. After opening at 146.20 yen, it ranged between
146.15 yen and 146.70 yen.
   A currency dealer with the Bank of Tokyo said market sentiment
for the dollar ``remains bullish'' following its overnight rise on
the New York market.
   The dollar's strength followed statements by two officials from
the U.S. Federal Reserve Board that it would not cut interest rates
any time soon.
   Manuel Johnson, a vice chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve
Board, and Wayne Angell, a governor of the board, were quoted in
Thursday's Wall Street Journal as saying they would not support
easier short-term U.S. interest rates unless economic conditions
changed.
   Higher interest rates tend to support a country's currency.
   Traders said the Bank of Japan probably sold between $300
million and $600 million during the Tokyo trading day, although few
participants could verify the intervention.
   ``The Bank of Japan sold a lot of dollars when it rose to 146.60
yen. It was pretty effective because there was a lot of
profit-taking on long-dollar positions at that level,'' said Robert
Mckeon, a trader with Manufacturers Hanover in Tokyo.
   Mckeon said that rumors in the market that the central bank
could raise the official discount rate in the near future, partly
to counter the dollar's strength and high money supply growth, gave
support to the yen against both the dollar and the mark.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, which slipped 91.68 yen on Thursday, rebounded 107.08
points, or 0.29 percent, to close at 36,836.54.
   The benchmark index fell in morning trading as investors were
concerned about the yen's decline against the dollar and falling
interest rates on Japanese bond futures.
   But share prices rebounded in a last-minute round of
futures-linked buying in afternoon trading.
   Securities dealers said the market seems to have hit bottom
after falling more than 2,000 points since the beginning of the
year, but there was not enough strength for a decisive rally.
   The afternoon rebound of Japanese government bond prices helped
the stock prices to recover, they said.
   Volume traded on the first section of the exchange, where most
major shares are listed, was estimated at 500 million shares.

   There was plenty of blame to go around at the
end of the lengthy and traumatic McMartin Pre-School molestation
trial, but no one was willing to accept it.
   In the nation's longest and costliest trial, Raymond Buckey and
his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, were acquitted Thursday on 52
child molestation charges. The jury deadlocked on 13 other charges.
   Afterward, the district attorney who filed the case criticized
the current district attorney. The current district attorney blamed
his predecessor and defense attorneys. And some of the parents of
children who attended the school blamed everybody.
   ``The system is not going to protect children,'' said Jackie
McGauley, a parent who believes her child had been molested but
didn't testify in the case. ``Life is not fair,'' said Robert
Curry, whose son attended the McMartin school. ``I tell my children
all the time ... there is no such thing as fair.''
   The district attorney who originally pursued the case said he
would not have done anything differently.
   Robert Philibosian, now in private practice, angrily dismissed
accusations that he played up the McMartin case in 1984 _ with the
news media acting as eager accomplices _ to boost his public
profile as he ran for district attorney.
   ``I was a professional prosecutor for 16 years before this case
was brought,'' he said. ``To have people who know very little about
professional or prosecutorial ethics, to criticize me personally
that I have some political motive is totally unjustified.''
   Philibosian instead pointed the finger at the man who defeated
him, current District Attorney Ira Reiner. Philibosian said Reiner
hurt prosecutor's chances by dismissing charges against five of the
original seven defendants and criticizing the case in a 1986 ``60
Minutes'' interview.
   But Reiner, calling his dismissal of charges for lack of
evidence ``the decision we're proud of,'' said the trial took so
long because of the state's ponderous criminal justice system,
delay tactics by defense attorneys and a mess left behind by
Philibosian.
   ``This is a case I inherited,'' Reiner said.
   In interviews, many jurors said they believed some of the
children were molested, but the prosecution never established that
the defendants were responsible.
   ``Even if you accept that the children were molested, it didn't
necessarily mean they were molested at the McMartin Pre-School,''
said juror Brenda Williams.

   Jerusalem police today arrested pro-PLO
Palestinian activist Faisal Husseini, who has been considered a
potential negotiator in proposed Israeli-Palestinian talks.
   Police spokesman Uzi Sandori said Husseini was brought in for
questioning and would be taken to court, where police would request
an extension of his detention.
   On Thursday, Husseini was named as an unindicted co-conspirator
in a military court trial of five Jerusalem Palestinians. The five
were accused of forming a PLO-supported ``popular army'' unit to
carry out the orders of the underground leadership of the
anti-Israeli uprising.
   According to court documents, Husseini allegedly gave the men
money and agreed to consult with them about their activities.
   Husseini, 49, denied those allegations before his arrest.
``There is no truth to that story,'' he said in a telephone
interview Thursday.
   Family members today confirmed that police took Husseini from
his home in Arab east Jerusalem at about 7:30 a.m. They had no
details of the charges.
   However, Israel radio said Husseini is expected to be held on
incitement charges because of statements he made about the killing
of Palestinians suspected of collaborating with Israel. It said he
also may be investigated in connection with the military court case
against the five Palestinians.
   At a news conference in September sponsored by the Foreign Press
Association, Husseini accused Israel of organizing groups of armed
collaborators.
   ``The reaction from the people (Palestinians) was that they had
to get rid of these collaborators,'' Husseini said. ``The
responsibility (for the killings) ... is with the occupiers.''
   He said attacks on collaborators occurred under any occupation.
``We don't like to see any Palestinian killed,'' Husseini said.
``At the same time, we don't like to see collaborators among us.''
   Sari Nusseibeh, another leading Palestinian activist who was
named as an unindicted co-conspirator in a similar case last year,
said Husseini's arrest would have ``a negative impact on the peace
process.''
   He added: ``It confirms people's growing belief that the Israeli
government is not at all serious about the peace process and tries
everything it can to wriggle out of it.''
   The arrest came as Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin was winding up
talks with U.S. leaders in Washington. Rabin has been discussing
ways to break the current stalemate in efforts to convene
Palestinian-Israeli talks in Cairo.
   The efforts are deadlocked in part over the composition of a
10-member Palestinian delegation. Husseini's name has been raised
repeatedly as a possible negotiator, but right-wing Israeli
politicians contend he has been a key figure in the 25-month
uprising and have called for his arrest.
   Husseini heads the now-closed Arab Studies Society in east
Jerusalem. He spent 18 months in Israeli prisons at the start of
the uprising but was never charged or tried.
   In recent weeks, Israel has issued two orders banning Husseini
from traveling to the occupied lands and from going abroad. The
order banning travel abroad also affected six other Palestinians
and drew a strong protest from the United States.
   In another development Thursday, the army filed charges in a
special military court against Col. Yehuda Meir, the
highest-ranking officer to face trial for brutality during the
uprising.
   Meir, who served as military commander of Nablus in the West
Bank, was charged with eight offenses for ordering soldiers to beat
and break the limbs of 20 Arabs from the Beita and Hawara villages
in January 1988.

   A Beijing man was sentenced to death for turning
a hospital clinic where he worked as a night duty officer into a
brothel, an official daily said today.
   The Beijing Daily said He Shuchi also was found guilty of raping
five women at the Longtan Hospital, which he used more than 20
times in 1988 to set up nighttime liaisons between prostitutes and
their customers.
   He was sentenced by the Beijing Intermediate Court.
   The report said He, who had a history of arrests for stealing,
gambling and hooliganism, was given the death sentence because ``he
had not changed his pernicious habits'' and ``his crimes were
abominable to the extreme.''
   Prostitution has become increasingly prevalent in China in
recent years. It is one of ``six vices'' that are target of a
nationwide anti-crime campaign.
   The others are gambling, drugs, pornography, the kidnapping of
women and children, and profiteering through superstition.
   There have been several cases in recent months of death
sentences for similar crimes.
   The report did not say if the execution, usually by a bullet to
the back of the head, had been carried out.

<HEAD>Nine Preventable Chronic Diseases Kill Many, But Get Few Dollars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nine chronic diseases responsible for more than
half the deaths in the United States are getting only 2 percent of
the states' public health dollars, according to new federal health
research.
   The national Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday that
the chronic diseases _ diseases with long periods of onset or
suffering _ accounted for 1.1 million deaths in 1986, 52 percent of
the deaths nationwide.
   The diseases are stroke, heart disease, diabetes, obstructive
lung disease, lung cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer,
colorectal cancer and cirrhosis of the liver.
   Cigarette smoking, overweight, high blood pressure, drinking and
lack of exercise contribute to some or all of the diseases.
``They're all largely preventable _ or preventable to some
extent,'' said Dr. Robert Hahn, a CDC epidemiologist.
   ``We know what the risk factors are,'' Hahn said. ``We know less
about how you get people to act on them.''
   The survey of 45 states and the District of Columbia found that
less than 2 percent of state public health expenditures were
allocated to prevent and control chronic disease. The average state
expenditure was just 66 cents per person per year, Hahn said.
   Comparable figures on federal public health spending for chronic
disease were not available, Hahn said.
   Most of the health money from state governments in the United
States is tied up in Medicaid _ especially with the mounting
federal deficit in the 1980s, said Dr. Robert Blendon, chairman of
the Department of Health Policy and Management at the Harvard
School of Public Health.
   Most public health activities at the state level were paid for
by federal grants, but those grants are now fewer and states are
left scrambling just to fund Medicaid care for their sickest
citizens, Blendon said.
   ``Prevention of chronic disease became the residual that
disappeared,'' he said.
   `It's very frustrating; we just don't have the early warning
prevention systems, the minimal stuff that anybody who looks
sensibly at this would want to do,'' Blendon said.
   The 1986 death toll from the CDC's list of nine chronic diseases
included 593,000 deaths from heart disease, 149,000 from stroke,
125,000 from lung cancer, 71,000 from obstructive lung disease
(such as emphysema) and 55,000 from colorectal cancer. There were
40,000 breast cancer deaths; 37,000 from diabetes, 26,000 from
cirrhosis; and 4,500 cervical cancer deaths.
   The CDC said death rates from the nine preventable chronic
diseases were generally lower in the West. The highest 1986 death
rate was in Michigan, 518 such deaths per 100,000 people; lowest
was in Hawaii, 327 per 100,000.

AGE _ resigned Tuesday and the group's three-person office will
close its doors today, an aide to Rep. Tim Penny, D-Minn., the
organization's acting chairman, said Thursday.
   Durenberger and a former congressional aide, Paul Hewitt,
founded the organization in 1984 to represent working Americans on
such issues as Social Security and housing.
   However, AGE has been unable to raise money because of a pending
ethics investigation of Durenberger and allegations by Hewitt that
the senator steered the organization to assist his 1988 re-election
campaign, said Steve Kingsley, Penny's chief of staff.
   Durenberger and other board members, including Penny, have
denied the allegations.
   The 15-member board will meet Jan. 30 to determine the future of
the organization, she said.
   The Senate Ethics Committee is investigating allegations that
Durenberger laundered speaking fees through a book contract and
used special interest groups to pay for personal trips. The
committee has since widened the investigation to include real
estate transactions involving his Minneapolis condominium.

<HEAD>Navy: Trident 2 Missile Problems Solved</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy says problems that caused
submarine-launched Trident 2 missiles to spin out of control have
been cured and the missile program is ``on track'' for a March
deployment.
   ``My confidence is fully restored that we've solved the problem
beyond a shadow of a doubt,'' Rear Adm. Kenneth Malley told
reporters at a Pentagon briefing Thursday.
   Two of the first three submarine tests of the 44-foot, $26.5
million missile, formally known as the D-5, failed when the
missiles self-destructed.
   Following two successful undersea launches earlier this week,
Malley predicted the missiles will be deployed aboard the submarine
Tennessee on schedule.
   The Navy has touted the Trident submarines and their new
missiles as the ``most effective strategic platform in the world
today.''
   ``The Trident 2 program is now on track. ... It still looks like
it's very solid for the end of March,'' the admiral said of plans
to have the submarine armed and ready for patrols.
   The USS Tennessee will be the first of 24 subs to go to sea,
each carrying 24 of the weapons. The Trident 2 is capable of
hurling as many as 12 nuclear warheads to individual targets more
than 4,600 miles away.

<HEAD>NRC Says It Will Decide On Seabrook License Within Three Weeks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Seabrook, N.H., nuclear power plant
could be generating power for a million New England homes by May
under a licensing schedule laid out by the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission.
   The commission said Thursday that it would make a decision
within three weeks on whether to issue a full-power license to the
long-embattled plant.
   The announcement by NRC Chairman Kenneth Carr came after the
commission listened for three hours as plant operators and the NRC
staff reported that Seabrook is ready to begin producing
electricity at full power.
   In a victory for plant opponents, the NRC agreed to rule on
several contested issues, including emergency evacuation plans,
before deciding on the license.
   ``There is reasonable assurance that the plant can and will be
operated without endangering the health and safety of the public,''
the NRC staff concluded in its report to the commission. ``The
staff recommends commission approval to issue a full-power
license.''
   Thomas Murley, the NRC's Director of Nuclear Reactor Regulation,
told the commission that ``emergency preparedness at Seabrook is
adequate to support full-power operations.''
   Seabrook, conceived more than two decades ago and built near a
salt marsh two miles north of the Massachusetts border, cost $6.4
billion, and the price tag is still rising. It has generated mass
protests by environmentalists, lawsuits by Massachusetts officials
and bankruptcy protection for its beleaguered principal owner,
Public Service Company of New Hampshire.
   Only three of the five-member NRC board will decide Seabrook's
fate. Two others said they would abstain from the deliberations
because of past involvement at lower levels in the Seabrook
licensing process.

<HEAD>Morris Says Error Caused Worm to go Berserk</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM KATES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A graduate student told a jury he became
frightened when he realized the worm program he introduced into a
federal computer network was replicating out of control.
   Robert T. Morris, speaking publicly for the first time about the
Nov. 2, 1988, attack that disabled an estimated 6,000 computers
nationwide, testified Thursday that the worm was an experiment that
turned into a ``dismal failure'' because of a programming error he
made.
   ``Are you proud of yourself?'' his attorney, Thomas Guidoboni,
asked.
   ``No, I'm not,'' said Morris, 25, who has been suspended by
Cornell University and faces up to five years in prison and a
$250,000 fine if convicted of a felony computer-tampering charge.
   ``I was scared. It seemed like the worm was getting out of
control,'' Morris said. ``My purpose was to see if I could write a
program that would spread as widely as possible. My intention was
that it should not grow. The worm spread on the network far faster
than I expected.''
   Morris' testimony was the last in the federal trial. Closing
statements are scheduled for Monday.
   Questioned by prosecutor Mark Rasch, Morris freely admitted
designing the worm to break into the Internet network, which links
computers at major universities, NASA and several military
facilities.
   Morris said he gathered passwords from various universities and,
without permission, decoded them to make sure the worm would spread
widely. He said he also took steps to make it difficult to detect.
   During questioning by Guidoboni, Morris told the jury he
included mechanisms to limit the worm's growth and left out any
commands that would have caused it to permanently damage existing
files in the computers it attacked.
   He said he wanted to avoid overloading the network, so he
decided on a method to let the worm re-enter computers it already
had infected just once in every seven tries.
   Morris thought the worm would duplicate a few times a day or
every few hours, but the programming error caused the worm to
continually re-enter each computer.
   Morris said he unleashed the worm into the Internet network
through computers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in
Cambridge, Mass., at about 8 p.m. on Nov. 2, 1988.
   He said he then went out for dinner, and when he returned about
three hours later, he noticed Cornell's own computer was slow to
respond to commands.
   Morris said that when he found copies of the worm in the Cornell
system, he knew it was spreading and realized it wasn't working
right.
   Initially, Morris said he considered sending out a second worm
designed to track down and destroy the first worm. But Morris said
he decided against that after seeing the unpredictable nature of
the first worm.
   Instead, he said he called Andrew Sudduth, a friend at Harvard
University, and asked him to send a message on an electronic
bulletin board read mainly by Internet users. Morris said he wanted
to apologize for unleashing the worm and tell users how to
eliminate it.
   Sudduth testified Wednesday that it took two days for the
message to reach the bulletin board because the route he picked was
backed up.

   A Panamanian businessman realized he couldn't
live on the run and turned himself in to face charges of plotting
with Manuel Noriega to smuggle 1.4 million pounds of marijuana into
the United States, his attorney said.
   Enrique A. Pretelt, who surrendered to U.S. forces in Panama on
Wednesday, pleaded innocent in federal court Thursday and was
ordered held at an undisclosed location until a detention hearing
Monday.
   ``He's a legitimate, successful businessman. People like that
can't live on the run,'' said defense attorney George Tragos.
``He's got one thing to clear up in his life to get on with his
life and that's this indictment.''
   Trial was set tentatively for April before U.S. District Judge
George C. Carr.
   Pretelt, 47, was charged along with the fallen Panamanian leader
with conspiracy and trying to smuggle the marijuana from Colombia
in 1983-84. He is accused of taking bribes from Tampa-based
smugglers to help ferry millions of dollars worth of the marijuana
safely through Panama.
   Prosecutors also said Noriega and Pretelt took payoffs and
laundered drug profits through banks and businesses in Panama.
   The Tampa indictment was returned Feb. 4, 1988, the same day
Noriega was charged in a complex cocaine racketeering indictment in
Miami. That trial is set for March 5.
   ``It's our great hope that he is tried separate and apart from
Mr. Noriega,'' said Tragos after the brief arraignment. ``We're
hoping that this trial here will go before the other trial
concludes so that we can ensure being tried alone.''
   Tragos refused to comment on whether a plea agreement might be
in the works.
   If convicted, Pretelt faces a maximum penalty of 35 years in
prison and fines totaling $265,000.
   According to the Tampa indictment, more than $1 million was paid
to Noriega, Pretelt and Cesar Rodriguez-Contreras for Noriega's
authorization and approval of drug smuggling and money laundering
activities in Panama. Rodriguez has since been assassinated in
Medellin, Colombia.

   Police and FBI agents who had trailed two gunmen
to a bank fatally shot them after they robbed it and tried to flee
with a bag of cash.
   The men, unaware they were being followed, ran into the Hamilton
Federal Savings Bank in the borough of Brooklyn on Thursday
morning, wearing stocking masks and ski caps. The men carried a
sawed-off shotgun and a revolver, authorities said.
   About 30 heavily armed FBI agents and police sealed off the
block. The robbers jumped in their car and tried to drive away,
attempting to run down two officials in the process. Neither was
injured.
   Officers fired into the car, killing both men, said Assistant
Chief Joseph Calzerano. Witnesses said at least 20 shots were fired
at the car.
   The two men had been linked to a crime ring responsible for a
dozen area bank robberies during the past 18 months that netted
more than $250,000, said William Y. Doran, head of the FBI's
criminal division in the city.

   ``Ray Will Die'' is scrawled in
big black letters on the faded green paint of the McMartin
Pre-School, testimony to the rage inflamed by the notorious
child-molesting case.
   Former McMartin teachers Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy
McMartin Buckey, were acquitted Thursday of 52 charges of molesting
students. Jurors were deadlocked on 13 other counts.
   Whatever happens on those charges, few in this
upper-middle-class Los Angeles suburb would disagree with the judge
in the trial, William Pounders, who once said, ``The case has
poisoned everyone who had contact with it.''
   Sue Brown, a receptionist at a medical office across the street
from the school, said she had two friends who were involved in the
case and had been convinced of the Buckeys' guilt.
   ``I think they got off scot-free,'' Brown said. ``I'm really
sick about it.''
   Alan Lagunoff, whose son, now 10, testified against the Buckeys,
stood in front of the run-down, long-closed nursery school and
talked about his disappointment.
   ``The defense did everything to prolong the case and the
prosecution did not do enough research to prosecute the case
properly,'' he said.
   A cold wind blasted leaves across the schoolyard as Lagunoff
leaned on the rusted chain-link fence surrounding the dilapidated
L-shaped building.
   ``I'd like to see the school become a center for abused
children,'' he said. ``It should be put to some good use rather
than tear it down.''
   But another longtime Manhattan Beach resident disagreed.
   ``I'd like to see it torn down,'' said Brenda Platt. ``I'd like
to have no memories of this.''
   Platt, who has two children aged 1 and 3, said she has serious
doubts about placing them in a day-care center because of the
McMartin trial.
   ``I think (the McMartin case) is a disgrace to Manhattan Beach
and society. It's totally upsetting,'' Platt said.
   Linda Geisert, another resident of the beach city, was also
upset.
   ``I'm greatly disappointed in the legal system and quite frankly
in the jurors,'' Geisert said.
   For all his disappointment, Lagunoff said he did not feel the
prosecutors should retry the remaining 13 counts.
   ``It would be just more of the same circus,'' he said.
   ``We put so much faith and hope in our courts,'' said Robert
Canter, 74. ``And this is what we get _ frustration.''

   Efforts to establish a monument to the
Free Speech Movement are meeting resistance from the same quarters
on the University of California that opposed the movement to begin
with.
   A coalition of faculty members has suggested a commemorative
piece of artwork in Sproul Plaza, the location of many rallies by
the student movement that helped kick off years of protest around
the country.
   The initial 1964 protest concerned administration rules limiting
political activity on campus.
   Chancellor Ira Michael Heyman said in a letter to faculty
Thursday that he opposes the monument.
   ``I am troubled,'' Heyman said, ``in our establishing a monument
in celebration of a movement which is viewed by many in the
community with negative or mixed emotions.''
   A group of faculty members conducted a nationwide design
competition that attracted more than 1,000 entries.
   ``I think once we come up with a brilliant piece of art, there's
no reason to believe it will not be passed,'' said professor Peter
Seltz, former director of the UC Art Museum and chair of the
Berkeley Art Project.

   The dollar rose in European trading this morning
as market sentiment continued to run toward the U.S. currency.
   Gold was lower in slack trading.
   Analysts said the dollar is rising on expectations that U.S.
interest rates are not likely to ease in the near future. Tensions
in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe also made traders more
favorable to the dollar, analysts said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 146.33 yen, up 0.67 yen from
Thursday's close of 145.66 yen. After opening at 146.20 yen, it
ranged between 146.15 yen and 146.70 yen.
   Later in London, the dollar sold for 146.28 yen.
   Traders said the Bank of Japan probably sold between $300
million and $600 million during the Tokyo trading day, although few
participants could verify the intervention.
   ``The Bank of Japan sold a lot of dollars when it rose to 146.60
yen. It was pretty effective because there was a lot of
profit-taking on long-dollar positions at that level,'' said Robert
Mckeon, a trader with Manufacturers Hanover in Tokyo.

   Gov. Rose Mofford said she was lying in a
hospital bed when she first started thinking about not seeking a
full term in the office.
   On Thursday, her first day back at work since undergoing surgery
a month ago to remove her gallbladder, she announced she would not
seek election this fall and retire after nearly half a century in
state government.
   Mofford became governor two years ago with the impeachment of
then-Gov. Evan Mecham. She had been secretary of state.
   ``There are so many things I want to do that I don't think there
will be enough time left in my life to do them all,'' the
67-year-old Democrat said.
   ``I feel this one I have to call for Rosie.''
   She has been plagued by medical problems, including a
concussion, cataracts and headaches.
   But she denied she was bowing out of politics because of her
health.
   ``I'm not tired,'' she said. ``I wish I had 50 years to go.''
   She underwent gallbladder surgery Dec. 18, and before Thursday
returned to the Capitol only to deliver an abbreviated State of the
State address Jan. 8.
   Mrs. Mofford also had political troubles. Throughout her term
she was criticized for her hands-off style of government.
   Particularly damaging was her commutation of the prison
sentences of two convicted murderers last year, which she later
rescinded, saying she didn't realize that families of the victims
had not been notified.
   Mrs. Mofford's decision not to run opens the door for other
Democrats, who had stayed out of the contest. Mecham and several
other Republicans have already announced their intention to run for
governor.
   Mrs. Mofford went to work in 1941 as a secretary in the state
treasurer's office and never left state government. She was
appointed assistant secretary of state in 1955 and 22 years later,
she succeeded her boss, Wesley Bolin, who became governor.
   She went on to win election to the office in 1978, 1982 and 1986.

   Citizens of Nagasaki protested what they
called a threat to free speech today as police questioned a
right-wing extremist accused of trying to kill Mayor Hitoshi
Motoshima.
   The 67-year-old mayor was reported in stable condition a day
after he was shot in the back as he left City Hall. The mayor had
received death threats for over a year after he said the late
Emperor Hirohito bore some responsibility for World War II.
   About 300 city hall workers rallied today in a parking lot
beside their building to denounce the attack and demand that police
crack down on anti-extremists.
   The attack, an unusual event in a country where handguns are
outlawed, was said to be the first shooting of an important
politician in Japan since World War II.
   Police were questioning an avowed right-wing terrorist, Kazumi
Tajiri, 40, of Tokyo, and searching offices of his group, called
the Sane Thinkers' School, a Nagasaki state police spokesman said.
   Tajiri admitted to shooting Motoshima and was being held on
suspicion of attempted murder, the spokesman said on condition of
anonymity.
   Police said they found a .22-caliber pistol in the hotel room
where Tajiri was arrested, with one spent shell and four live
bullets.
   The National Police Agency urged local authorities to increase
their vigilance over the nation's 820 right-wing groups and
recommended tighter security for public figures, said an agency
spokesman in Tokyo.
   At the Nagasaki rally, Yukiyoshi Sato, secretary-general of the
City Hall Workers' Union, said the mayor ``risked his own life in
fighting to protect freedom of speech and democracy.''
   ``We declare our resolve to resolutely uphold these principles
in the wake of this attempt to suppress them with a pistol.''
   The Nagasaki city council said in a declaration: ``This incident
is not only a challenge to freedom of speech but a threat to the
very existence of a democratic society, and is unpardonable.''
   ``It's a real shock,'' said city hall worker Mikako Umehara.
``In Japan, it's so rare for anyone to have a gun _ just police and
gangsters. For this to happen right in front of our eyes is, I
think, a much bigger shock than for Americans or Europeans.''
   ``This act should never be condoned, in light of democracy and
freedom,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said today.
The government, he said, ``must take all possible measures to
prevent such incidents.'' He did not elaborate.
   Tajiri's group, which has a record of violence, was active in
the rightist intimidation campaign against Motoshima. It began
after the mayor said in December 1988 that the late emperor
``shares responsibility for the war, as well as all of us who lived
in that period.''
   Motoshima said the emperor could have ended the war sooner and
spared Nagasaki from its atomic-bomb attack. Nagasaki was struck on
Aug. 9, 1945, three days after Hiroshima. Japan surrendered on Aug.
15.
   The mayor's comments, made as Hirohito lay dying of cancer,
outraged the rightists, who revere the imperial family. Hirohito
died Jan. 7, 1988 at the age of 87.
   The mayor's opinion is shared by many Japanese, as evidenced by
the 286,000 people who signed petitions backing his statement. But
rightist groups have circled Nagasaki City Hall many times with
sound trucks blaring ``Death to Motoshima!''
   In 1987, Tajiri appeared in an interview at TV Asahi, where he
was asked if he was willing to kill somebody he hated.
   ``Yes, because after all, right-wingers are terrorists,''
replied Tajiri.
   People who answered the phone or the door intercom at his
group's offices refused to speak to reporters.
   Free speech is guaranteed in Japan's postwar constitution. But
in the past, newspapers and others who exercise it have sometimes
been the target of rightist violence.
   An attack blamed on rightists at an office of Asahi Shimbun, a
leading newspaper, killed one reporter and wounded another in 1987.

<HEAD>Former Prime Minister Files Libel Suit Against Newspaper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone filed a
libel suit against a leading national newspaper today, claiming it
had falsely accused him of involvement in a stock deal, his aide
said.
   In the lawsuit filed with the Tokyo District Court, Nakasone
demanded that the newspaper, Asahi Shimbun, publish an apology,
said Yoshihiko Kamiwada, Nakasone's secretary.
   ``The article was filled with malice and inaccuracies,'' he
said. ``Nakasone had no part in the stock deal.''
   Asahi, which has an estimated daily circulation of 8 million,
reported in a front-page story Jan. 1 that Nakasone was involved in
a behind-the-scenes stock deal in 1987 while still in office.
   It reported that one of his aides earned profits of $85,700 from
what it described as questionable share transactions in Kokusai
Kogyo, a Tokyo-based aerial surveying contractor.
   Kamiwada said the Asahi article led readers to believe Nakasone
was personally involved in the deal, though he said there was no
evidence to support such allegations.
   ``We have said repeatedly that the stock deal was done by his
secretary independently,'' he said. ``It is clear that Asahi was
trying to hurt Nakasone's image and damage him in the coming
election.''
   Asahi spokesman Takemi Akiba said in a statement that the
article was ``objectively reported.''
   ``We have conducted more than sufficient investigations and have
gotten testimony of parties involved,'' he said. ``And we have full
confidence.''
   Nakasone has been shadowed for more than a year by allegations
he was involved in the separate Recruit influence-peddling scandal.
   Nakasone was never charged in that scandal, but opposition
parties forced him to testify at a parliamentary hearing in May. He
resigned on May 29 after the hearing to take responsibility for the
Recruit scandal.
   Since then, Nakasone has been fighting an uphill battle to
maintain his influence. Analysts say he needs an overwhelming win
in the upcoming election of Parliament's lower house, scheduled for
Feb. 18, to return to the governing party.

<HEAD>Three Coal Strikes End, Negotiations Continue At Other Mines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of miners who struck for higher
pay returned to work today at three southern mines, and
negotiations were under way to end two other walkouts, the official
news agency PAP said.
   The strikes, which began Tuesday, were the first significant
labor protest since the Jan. 1 start of radical reforms aimed at
transforming Poland's economy to capitalism.
   Strikes ended this morning at the Thorez, Walbrzych and Victoria
mines in Walbrzych, a city 12 miles from the Czechoslovak border,
PAP said.
   The resolution followed negotiations between miners'
representatives and the Industry Ministry in Warsaw, but no details
were reported.
   Negotiations also were reported under way to resolve strikes by
about 6,000 workers at the Czerwone Zaglebie mine and another 40 at
the Niwka Modrzejow mine, both in the city of Sosnowiec just
outside Katowice, an industrial center about 185 miles south of
Warsaw.
   The miners at the Czerwone Zaglebie mine have been demanding a
$26 supplement to their wages for December. The miners in Walbrzych
had similar demands, PAP said.
   All the striking miners are calling for retention of special
shopping privileges for miners, a reduction in administrative
workers in offices and no repercussions against strikers.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said strikes were an inappropriate
response at this point to the nation's difficult economic
situation. ``If everybody strikes ... anarchy, a lack of
understanding will deepen,'' he said during a news conference
Thursday in Gdansk.
   Under the economic plan, the government has sharply raised
prices but halted wage increases while trying to create a
market-oriented economy and curb inflation.
   None of the mines involved in the current protests partcipated
in the August 1988 strikes that pushed Poland's then-Communist
government to begin political reform talks with the Solidarity-led
opposition.
   Those talks led to parliamentary elections in June and the
formation in August of the East bloc's first non-Communist
government.

   A threat of fog that proved real
blocked Columbia's return to Earth until Saturday, making for the
longest space shuttle mission yet.
   The shuttle had planned a pre-dawn landing today at Edwards Air
Force Base, Calif., but Mission Control decided to keep Columbia in
orbit because conditions were favorable for a fog bank to move in
suddenly.
   The new landing time of 12:01 a.m. PST extends the flight to
nearly 11 days, surpassing the old record by 11 hours, 38 minutes.
That was set by Columbia in 1983.
   Capsule communicator Mike Baker early today initially directed
the five astronauts to lengthen the flight by one orbit, or 95
minutes, in case the fog forecast improved.
   When it didn't, he said, ``We've decided not to come home today.
The weather looks a lot better Saturday.''
   ``OK. Sounds like the best plan,'' Columbia commander Dan
Brandenstein responded. Earlier he said, ``This is not a good
vehicle to fly into fog.''
   The forecasters proved right. Dense patches of fog formed and
were in the area at the planned landing time. Flight rules dictate
visibility of seven miles for landing.
   ``Our concerns were valid and we did the proper thing today,''
said Flight Director Lee Briscoe.
   The initial directive to hold off was relayed to the astronauts
just three hours before they were to have fired their re-entry
engines, wrapping up a flight that deployed one satellite and
rescued another.
   The shuttle will have four chances Saturday to land at the
Mojave Desert base.
   Columbia carries enough fuel and other supplies to stay in orbit
until at least Monday, officials said.
   Other U.S. landing sites at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida
and at White Sands Missile Base, N.M., also had unacceptable
weather conditions today.
   The space travelers planned a day of exercising, photography and
other light activity.
   Their day began at 9:35 p.m. EST Thursday with Mission Control
blaring the Steppenwolf song, ``Born to Be Wild'' as the wakeup
music.
   ``Good morning Columbia, I hope you're ready to rock and roll,''
said the control center.
   ``We're ready to rock and roll,'' replied shuttle pilot Jim
Wetherbee.
   The 11-ton scientific satellite stowed in the spaceship's cargo
bay had been in orbit for nearly six years before being snared by
the astronauts a week ago.
   The satellite, called the Long Duration Exposure Facility, was
deployed by a shuttle crew in April 1984 and was supposed to remain
in orbit for less than a year, but its retrieval was delayed
because of scheduling changes and the 1986 Challenger accident.
   Scientists want to know how the various experimental materials
stored in 57 trays outside the LDEF withstood being pounded by
micrometeoroids, blasted by cosmic rays and corroded by highly
reactive atomic oxygen.
   ``We believe LDEF is a real treasure that's going to help very
much in designing future space satellites, shuttles and space
stations,'' Brandenstein said Thursday as the crew spoke by
radio-telephone with President Bush at the White House.
   Bush called the rescue ``a very exciting grab.''
   If the astronauts had failed to catch it, the satellite was
expected to be destroyed in March in a fiery dive through Earth's
atmosphere.
   Brandenstein, Wetherbee and mission specialists Bonnie Dunbar,
David Low and Marsha Ivins devoted most of the time in space to
medical and science experiments and Earth photography.
   The mission is the 33rd shuttle flight and is a steppingstone
toward months-long trips aboard the space station starting in the
mid-1990s.

<TEXT>
   A streetwise veteran of the civil rights
movement, Marion Barry has always prided himself on being a
survivor.
   ``My background is one of survival,'' Barry told The Washington
Post a month before his first election as mayor in 1978.
   ``I mean I was lucky, you know,'' he said. ``I used to run
around with guys who went to prison or are dead. I was lucky. I was
the one who didn't get caught by the police when we were out
shooting dice or something.''
   Now, after more than a decade as mayor of the nation's capital,
Barry's survival skills were facing their severest test after his
arrest on a narcotics charge Thursday night at a downtown hotel.
   A federal law enforcement source said authorities had a
videotape of Barry smoking cocaine.
   The son of Mississippi sharecroppers, Barry claimed he could
move as easily among royalty as among the city's poor, boasting,
``I'm the mayor of all the people'' even as he was found in
compromising positions that put investigators on his path.
   Barry has been under federal investigation during much of the
time since 1984 for his ties to drug suspects. Two deputy mayors
went to jail for crimes in office and recent news reports suggested
the wall of silence created by Barry's friends was crumbling as
some former associates testified before a grand jury.
   Barry has always liked to point to the gunshot wound he suffered
in the City Hall building in 1977 as an example of how he could
never be counted out.
   ``He is not going to go out quietly,'' said Max Berry, a former
key political adviser, after the mayor's arrest.
   Berry, who turned against Barry after the mayor's troubles grew
last year, added: ``If he has not been telling the truth to the
people, he's going to face the possibility of resigning, but he has
always been a strong campaigner and a proud person. What kind of
effect this will have on his ego, I don't know.''
   Earlier this month, a Los Angeles Times profile got him into
political hot water when he was quoted as boasting he would cut his
opponents ``off at the kneecaps'' and that Jesse Jackson, a
potential mayoral opponent whom Barry once supported, ``don't wanna
run nothing but his mouth.''
   Barry scoffed at federal investigators, always denying he ever
used drugs.
   Barry and his third wife, Effi, have one son, Christopher, 10.
   He was born on March 6, 1936, to Marion and Mattie Barry, in the
small Mississippi delta town of Itta Bena, and was raised in
Memphis after the death of his father, a sharecropper.
   Barry did graduate work in chemistry at Fisk University in
Nashville, but was sidetracked on his way to a doctorate by the
growing civil rights movement and left school with a master's
degree. He was the first national chairman of the Student
Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, which sent young people into
the South to register black voters.
   SNCC brought him to Washington, where he became immersed in
local issues, joining boycotts of the bus system and leading
protests clad in traditional African garb.
   With his second wife, Mary Treadwell, he helped found a black
self-help group, Pride, Inc. Treadwell was convicted in 1983 of
misusing funds in connection with a real estate spinoff of Pride.
   Barry's high profile as an anti-establishment activist propelled
him into local politics, first as a member of the Board of
Education and then in 1974 as a member of the first elected City
Council organized under home rule law.
   In 1977 he was wounded by a shotgun blast in the Hanafi Muslim
takeover of the District Building, the district's city hall. A
reporter was killed.
   In 1978, only a decade after marching against the city
establishment, he defeated incumbent Mayor Walter Washington in the
city's Democratic mayoral primary and went on to easily win the
general election.
   His tenure has been noted for extensive downtown office and
hotel development, a soaring murder rate among young drug users
and, critics charge, deterioration of services like housing despite
the largest city bureaucracy in the country on a per capita basis.
   Just this week, Barry boasted that the city was winning its war
against violent crime. He made that claim the same day President
Bush called January the ``month of murder'' in Washington.
   His legal troubles began shortly after his first re-election in
1982, with the first of federal investigations he termed attempts
to ``lynch black people another way.''
   In 1984 Karen Johnson, a convicted cocaine dealer with whom
Barry admitted having a ``personal'' relationship, served 11 months
in jail on contempt of court charges rather than tell investigators
whether she used drugs with Barry or sold them to him.
   The current round of investigation was touched off in December
1988, when Barry repeatedly visited the hotel room of a suspected
drug dealer, Charles Lewis. City police were sent there to
investigate a report that Lewis was selling drugs, but the mission
was called off when officers found out Barry was present.
   Lewis later was convicted of cocaine charges in the Virgin
Islands and has pleaded guilty to a drug conspiracy count in
Washington. There have been recent news reports that Lewis told
prosecutors he provided drugs to the mayor.

   Israeli warplanes blasted a PLO radio
station and bases of pro-Iranian Moslem fundamentalists in raids
today in south Lebanon, killing at least five people and wounding
12, police said.
   Two people were reported missing.
   Four Israeli jets fired on outposts of the fundamentalist
Hezbollah, or Party of God, in a pre-dawn raid, police said.
Several hours later, six warplanes raided the radio station of the
Mieh Mieh refugee camp near the port of Sidon, they said.
   That 77-minute raid destroyed a radio station that the Palestine
Liberation Organization planned to use to transmit programs to the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, a police spokesman said.
   The Israeli army said the station ``was intended to broadcast
orders to guerrillas in Lebanon and hostile groups in the
territories.'' It said all its jets returned safely to base.
   Six Phantom F-4 fighter-bombers fired 34 rockets in seven runs,
wrecking the two transmission aerials of the station called Radio
al-Quds, or Radio Jerusalem, according to police.
   The station was testing to begin programming Feb. 1, said the
police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing rules.
   He said at least three people were killed and eight wounded in
Mieh Mieh and that two people were missing.
   Guerrillas fired ground-to-air missiles that were deflected by
scarlet heat balloons released by the pilots of the raiding jets,
police said.
   Smoke billowed afterward from several parts of the stricken
shantytown on the southeastern fringe of Sidon, which is about 25
miles south of Beirut.
   The spokesman said several delayed-fuse rockets were fired to
blow up the underground structure of the station, but no word on
the damage was immediately available.
   Police said four Israeli jets carried out two rocketing sorties
on outposts of Hezbollah in the villages of Ein Bouswar, Lwaize,
Mlikh and Jabal Safi in the region of Iqlim al-Tuffah.
   A police spokesman in Sidon, six miles west of Iqlim al-Tuffah,
said the jets fired six rockets on the Hezbollah bases, killing at
least two guerrillas and wounding four.
   Hezbollah sources in Beirut said the warplanes dropped
``devastating rockets on our bases'' but refused to discuss damage
or casualties.
   The raids followed a rocket attack on an Israeli border area
Thursday. The army said several Soviet-designed rockets fired from
south Lebanon fell but caused no damage or injuries.
   The rockets landed in Israel's self-proclaimed security zone, a
strip six to 10 miles deep in south Lebanon designed as a buffer
against guerrilla attacks.
   By police count, at least 28 people were killed and 137 wounded
in 18 Israeli air raids in Lebanon last year. This was the first
raid this year.

   Riot police with attack dogs
today beat and dispersed scores of anti-apartheid protesters who
demonstrated against an English cricket team defying a ban on
sports ties with South Africa.
   Dozens of police, wielding batons and spraying tear gas, charged
into about 100 mostly black protesters who tried to enter the
international terminal at Jan Smuts Airport to protest the arrival
of the English team. Snarling police dogs lunged at protesters,
biting people and knocking them over.
   Dozens of protesters fell on each other and were trapped as they
scrambled to escape the dogs. Police officers beat protesters with
long batons as they lay on the ground, trying to ward off the blows.
   Several protesters were led away with blood pouring from head
cuts and other wounds, but no injury toll was released. Police said
10 protesters were arrested.
   Demonstrators in six buses arrived at the airport to protest the
arrival of a so-called ``rebel'' team of top English players on a
six-week professional tour. The players face five-year bans from
international competition for competing in South Africa.
   Most nations, including Britain, ban official sports contacts
with South Africa because of its policies of discrimination against
the black majority.
   ``Ban racist tours,'' said placards carried by protesters along
with the green, black and yellow flag of the outlawed African
National Congress, the main black political organization.
   Police initially kept the protesters on the buses, but about 100
were allowed to march to the terminal and gather there, peacefully
singing and dancing. Riot police tore into the crowd after the
protesters were ordered to disperse.
   The protesters were chased back to their buses by the police
officers and dogs. Police then ordered the buses to leave.
   A senior police officer said the demonstration was illegal
because the protesters failed to obtain a magistrate's permit. He
said the violence used by police was not excessive.
   The team arrived about three hours after police dispersed
protesters. The South African Press Association reported the South
African Airways plane was delayed three hours in London after a
bomb threat from an anonymous caller.
   Team captain Mike Gatting told an airport press conference said
people should be allowed to protest peacefully. ``We're unhappy
that if it was a peaceful demonstration, that it was disrupted,''
he said.
   The English players reportedly are receiving $160,000 each, with
Gatting getting $320,000, for their appearance.
   Winnie Mandela, wife of jailed black leader Nelson Mandela, and
several black leaders at the airport complained of the police
tactics. Mrs. Mandela said the police tactics undermined President
F. W. de Klerk's claim that he wants to dismantle apartheid.
   ``We saw unlimited violence unleashed towards our people here,''
she said.
   Officials of the South African Cricket Union say the tour, which
they are financing, is costing $1.6 million.

   Prime Minister V.P. Singh's government today
brought Jammu-Kashmir state under tighter federal control in an
effort to combat escalating violence by Moslem separatists.
   The new state governor, Jagmohan, told reporters the state
legislature has been suspended and the region would now be
administered through his office.
   ``My top priority will now be to solve the Kashmir problem, but
my approach will be that of love for an ailing patient as (shown
by) a nursing orderly,'' said Jagmohan, who has a reputation as a
tough, no-nonsense administrator.
   He said he would visit Srinagar, the state's summer capital and
the stronghold of Kashmiri militants, on Saturday to ``assess the
situation.''
   Militants in the Kashmir region of the state are fighting to set
up an independent Moslem state or join neighboring Pakistan, an
Islamic nation.
   At least 26 people have been killed in Jammu-Kashmir since the
beginning of the year, and Moslem agitators have repeatedly
attacked government buildings and police patrols.
   In Islamabad, Pakistan, the leader of a Moslem militant group
today promised to make India pay for the appointment. ``It clearly
means the government is going to have a go at crushing our freedom
fighters,'' said Amanullah Khan, the leader of the Jammu-Kashmir
Liberation Front. ``But they are going to find it will cost them
far, far more than they can imagine.''
   In New Delhi, Home Ministry spokesman Krishna Rao said
Jammu-Kashmir had been placed under governor's rule, which is akin
to federal rule.
   Under the Indian Constitution, a governor is appointed by the
federal government and is subject to the decisions of the state
government, which is headed by a locally elected chief minister.
   But Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah resigned Thursday night in
protest of Jagmohan's appointment as governor, claiming he had not
been consulted.
   When a chief minister resigns, the governor can assume wide
executive and legislative powers.
   Singh's government named Jagmohan, who uses one name, to the
governor's post Thursday morning after procuring his predecessor's
resignation. The new governor took his oath of office today.
   Jagmohan, speaking at his official residence that was once a
palace of the former king of Jammu-Kashmir state, said he has
accepted the resignation of Abdullah and his Cabinet.
   Jammu-Kashmir is the only Indian state with a Moslem majority.
Moslems form about 12 percent of predominantly Hindu India's 880
million people and about 64 percent of Jammu-kashmir's 5 million
people.
   Abdullah's National Conference, a predominantly Moslem party, is
closely aligned with the Congress Party of ex-Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi and has differed with Singh's National Front government.
   The militants also have rejected the National Conference's
authority to govern the state, claiming it came to power through
rigged elections.
   Jagmohan, a Hindu who served as Jammu-Kashmir's governor from
1982 to 1988, has been credited by newspapers with curbing the
spread of Moslem agitation during his previous tenure.

   The Communist Party advocates a
multiparty system, parliamentary democracy, and religious freedom
in draft documents to be adopted at a party congress this month.
   The party statement, outlined late Thursday and due to be voted
on when the congress convenes Jan. 30, also called for eliminating
the Communists' ``Marxist-Leninist'' label.
   The changes are in line with the Communists' efforts to shed the
Stalinist image left over from the 34-year rule of hard-line leader
Todor Zhivkov. Zhivkov, who was forced to step down Nov. 10, is now
under house arrest and charged with abuse of power and fomenting
ethnic unrest while in office.
   ``The Bulgarian Communist Party must be de-Stalinized and
established as a new type of contemporary Marxist party,'' said a
draft declaration reported by the official BTA news agency.
   The report did not say when the drafts were formulated or by
whom. Usually such draft documents are done by senior party members.
   ``The political system of democratic socialism implies a
multiparty system, parliamentary democracy ... separation of
legislative, executive and judiciary powers ... guaranteed
freedoms, (and) autonomy of science and education,'' the document
said.
   According to the declaration, the Communist Party is willing to
recognize religious and some ethnic rights of the 1.5 million
minority Turks and other Bulgarian Moslems known as Pomaks.
   Zhivkov's often-violent, forced assimilation policy banned
Moslem religious practices and required ethnic Turks and Moslems to
forsake their own names and take Bulgarian ones.
   Bulgaria's ``society of national unity and agreement'' should
unite ``all citizens ... to provide freedom of rites and the use of
the language preferred in the everyday life, while guaranteeing
(Bulgaria's) territorial entity and sovereignty and the Bulgarian
language as an official one,'' the draft declaration said.
   The statement promised to provide guarantees against a ``relapse
to authoritarian methods and style of leadership,'' but it did not
say what these guarantees would involve.
   Parliament on Jan. 15 abolished the Communists' guaranteed
monopoly on power, but talks with the opposition on power-sharing
and democratization broke down Thursday after the leadership
refused to provide media access to the talks _ a key opposition
demand.
   The draft provides for all party offices to be elective and for
ballots to be secret.
   All party office-holders, apparently also including the party
chief, should only serve for two terms, BTA quoted the draft
statute as saying.
   It provided for the congress, the supreme body of the Communist
Party, to be convened every two years, instead of at five-year
intervals as is the case now.
   The document also urged a radical restructuring of the party,
which would include a Supreme Party Council to replace the existing
policy-setting Central Committee.
   Within the Supreme Party Council, committees and working groups
would be established to ``work on major problems of party
activity,'' BTA said.
   The declaration proposed that the Supreme Party Council should
elect a chairman, two deputy chairmen and a secretary of the party.
   Together with the chairmen of the standing committees, they
would form the chairmanship of the party _ the apparent successor
to the ruling Politburo.

   A mysterious man dressed in black left a half
bottle of cognac and three roses on Edgar Allan Poe's grave early
today in a ritual that for 41 years has marked the horror writer's
birthday.
   ``Tonight at 3 a.m., six of us inside Westminster Hall spotted a
man dressed in black with a white scarf walk into the grave yard
and place the cognac and roses on the grave,'' said Jeff Jerome,
curator of the Edgar Allan Poe House. ``Some saw a man with white
hair and others didn't.''
   The gifts first were left on Poe's grave at Westminster Hall in
1949, the 100th anniversary of his death, said Jerome, 40.
   There is some argument as to whether the same man has been
responsible for leaving the gift for the entire 41 years, or
whether there has been a succession of grave decorators. Stopping
the man to find out would be out of the question, Jerome said.
   ``First of all, that would be an invasion of privacy,'' he said.
``It's none of our business .. if we interfered, it would ruin it.''
   The man in black leaves a rose for each grave; the bodies of
Poe's wife, Virginia, who died at 25 of tuberculosis, and his aunt,
Maria Poe Clemm, are buried beside the writer.
   Among Poe's most well-known stories are ``The Pit and the
Pendulum,'' and ``The Fall of the House of Usher,'' as well as the
poem ``The Raven.''

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today blamed
violence between Azerbaijanis and Armenians on extremists fanning
ethnic hatred to hurt his reforms, and the government warned the
turmoil could escalate into a ``national catastrophe.''
   Gorbachev told a conference in Moscow that despite the Kremlin's
efforts _ about 29,000 troops and police cadets are trying to
maintain order in the southern republics _ the situation is not
improving.
   He said the six-day spasm of fighting, in which at least 72
people have died and more than 220 have been wounded, served the
interests of ``a group of extremists, irresponsible adventurists
and representatives of the shadow economy.''
   The shadow economy refers to the billions of rubles in illegal
trade conducted outside the state-run economy.
   ``Perestroika is a bone in their throat, but they can't oppose
it directly, so they clutch at tension on an ethnic basis,''
Gorbachev told a conference convened to discuss perestroika, or
restructuring.
   Gorbachev also blamed some Azerbaijani extremists who he said
are ``calling for the republic to secede from the U.S.S.R., for an
Islamic Azerbaijan,'' the Tass news agency said. But, he said,
``among the people they are not receiving support.''
   Most Azerbaijanis are Moslems, and most Armenians are
Christians. The two republics have been involved in a decades-old
dispute over a region known as Nagorno-Karabakh, which is inside
Azerbaijan but populated mainly by Armenians.
   The current violence is the worst since the dispute erupted anew
two years ago.
   ``Today's tragedy, if it is not stopped, tomorrow could turn
into a national catastrophe,'' said a statement carried by Tass and
broadcast on radio and television.
   The statement, signed by the Communist Party Central Committee,
the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet and the Council of Ministers,
accused extremists of advocating ``blind hatred and craziness.''
   The fighting broke out Saturday when Azerbaijani mobs attacked
Armenians in the Azerbaijan capital, Baku. Defense Minister Dmitri
T. Yazov called up the reserves Thursday to help cope with the
fighting, which he described as ``a great disaster.''
   At least 10,500 Armenians reportedly have been evacuated from
Baku.
   World chess champion Garri Kasparov said he and his family fled
the city Wednesday by boarding a plane for Moscow.
   Kasparov, 26, whose mother is Armenian, told the Spanish
newspaper El Pais in an interview published today that he was
``stunned by the atrocities'' he had seen.
   The government appeal today appeared to conflict with statements
earlier by Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, who said the violence was
decreasing.
   Ryzhkov spoke on ABC-TV's ``Prime Time Live,'' broadcast in the
United States Thursday night.
   Tass said today that ``the situation in Azerbaijan and Armenia
has aggravated in the past 24 hours.''
   Virtually all of Baku, an oil center of 1.8 million people, was
on strike to press demands that Soviet troops be pulled out of the
city and local authorities refrain from imposing martial law or a
curfew, said Savili Peretz, deputy director of Azerinform, the
Azerbaijani news agency.
   Extremists blockaded the Communist Party leadership's
headquarters, refusing to allow its staff to enter, Peretz said in
a telephone interview from Baku. He said extremists also blocked
all the major roads in and around Baku.
   Tass reported rioting on the Azerbaijani border with Iran, and
Peretz said some 31 miles of the border fences had been torn down
Thursday by Azerbaijanis who wanted to be united with relatives in
Iran. Today, guards are in control, he said.
   A journalist with Armenia's official news agency, Armenpress,
said four people were killed and 10 wounded early today in an
Azerbaijani attack on the village of Yeraskh, in the Armenian
republic on the border with the Azerbaijani enclave of Nakhichevan.
   The journalist, who asked to remain anonymous, said this was the
first time Azerbaijanis had attacked a village in Armenia proper
rather than around the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh.
   It was not clear whether the Yeraskh casualties were included in
the latest official death and injury tolls.
   In Moscow Thursday, officials announced that reserve troops had
been called up and that some military units had been put on a
wartime footing in the embattled region.
   Gorbachev revealed today that the call-up concerned mainly
reservists in the northern Caucasus region, and admitted it had
evoked complaints from the population there.
   Defense Minister Yazov said the reinforcements were needed, in
addition to the 29,000 already there, to maintain order and
possibly enforce a curfew. He did not say how many reserve soldiers
were called up.
   Authorities in Azerbaijan have refused up to now to impose a
curfew, despite reports of vicious attacks by Azerbaijani
extremists on Armenian residents. It was not clear whether the
Kremlin intended to impose the curfew in Baku and other parts of
Azerbaijan, or whether Yazov expected the Azerbaijani authorities
to do it.
   Interior Minister Vadim Bakatin said extremists had obtained
ground-to-ground missiles, tanks, helicopters and other heavy
weaponry.
   Foreign reporters have been barred from travel to the republics
since the latest violence began, making it impossible to verify the
reports on the fighting.
   Troops already in Azerbaijan and the republic of Armenia were
told Wednesday they could shoot if necessary to stop the bitter
fighting in the hills around Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Tass said officials in Nagorno-Karabakh expanded an existing
curfew by two hours Thursday and the military commandant there
ordered unregistered organizations dissolved.
   However, the Azerbaijani People's Front, which is blamed for
inciting demonstrations and ignoring calls for restoration of
order, is far more active in other areas of Azerbaijan.
   Yerevan, the Armenian capital, has been running out of fuel
because of the Azerbaijani blockade. Armenians have countered by
blockading Nakhichevan, an Azerbaijani enclave inside Armenia,
reports said.

   Two young Vietnamese refugees facing forced
repatriation entered the United Nations office at their detention
camp today and attempted suicide, a U.N. official said.
   They entered the office carrying some kind of sharp objects,
apparently knives, and stabbed themselves in the stomach, the
official said.
   The two men, aged 20 and 25, were rushed to a hospital with
abdomen injuries, a government spokeswoman said. One man was
discharged and the other was in satisfactory condition, said the
spokeswoman on condition of anonymity.
   ``They just walked into the office, said they were going to do
it, and did it,'' said Anne Dawson-Shepherd, deputy chief of
mission for the U.N. agency in this British colony. ``I think this
all happened extremely quickly.''
   The two boat people had been classified by immigration officers
as illegal immigrants seeking a better standard of living, instead
of political refugees, and their appeal to remain in Hong Kong was
denied, Ms. Dawson-Shepherd said.
   A U.N. field assistant and an interpreter were in the office
during today's incident. It occurred at the Whitehead detention
center, one of several camps housing a total of 44,000 boat people
who face repatriation against their will unless they can prove they
fled persecution in their homeland.
   Also today, 100 boat people at the Sham Shui Po detention center
in Kowloon protested being moved to Whitehead.
   Whitehead and the other cramped, squalid detention centers have
been particularly tense since Dec. 12, when 51 boat people were
whisked onto an airplane by security forces and forcibly
repatriated to Vietnam.
   Thousands of Vietnamese in Hong Kong detention centers have
peacefully protested the forced repatriation policy, although
rioting broke out in one camp when security forces attempted a
check for homemade weapons.
   The governor, Sir David Wilson, today said Hong Kong cannot
allow boat people to ``fashion lethal weapons'' that threaten those
inside the camps.
   ``We cannot allow violence to become a way of life in the
camps,'' he said.

   Crashes of small airplanes in California, Massachusetts and Ohio
killed eight people and injured four others.
   The FBI sent agents to investigate a Learjet crash that killed
two men Thursday north of Greenville, in western Ohio, because
widely scattered debris suggested the plane exploded in flight,
said Ed Boldt, an agent in the bureau's Cincinnati office.
   The rented executive jet was flying empty from Ypsilanti, Mich.,
its base, to Louisville, Ky., suggesting the men intended to pick
up cargo, said Mort Edelstein, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation
Administration, one of several agencies investigating the crash.
   Wilbur Baker, who saw the crash about a half-mile from his home,
said, ``It was a streak of fire going through the air.''
   In Burbank, Calif., a single-engine plane crashed shortly after
takeoff from the Burbank Airport late Thursday, killing all four
people aboard, FAA regional duty officer Jerry Acosta said.
   Shortly after taking off for Santa Barbara, ``The pilot then
radioed back to the control tower that it needed to land
immediately,'' Acosta said.
   The aircraft apparently had turned and was headed for the
airport when it crashed in one of the airport's remote parking
lots, said an airport operations official who declined to be
identified.
   In Great Barrington, Mass., two people were killed and four
injured when a single-engine plane carrying a group on a ski trip
in the Berkshire Hills crashed in the front yard of a home,
officials said. One of the injured was in critical condition.
   The plane, a Piper Lance, was taking off from Great Barrington
Airport on Thursday evening when it apparently veered away from the
runway, clipped the tops off of several trees and crashed into a
yard about 500 yards from a home, said police Officer Paul
Montgomery.

<HEAD>INS Releasing Illegal Immigrants from Detention in South Texas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOEL WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAYVIEW, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Immigration officials say an increase of
Central Americans crossing the border into south Texas is straining
detention centers and has forced the release of hundreds of
detainees this month.
   Immigration attorneys and others had speculated that detainees
were being released because the government expected an influx of
refugees from war-torn El Salvador and Nicaragua.
   But Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Gene
McNary said Thursday in Washington that ``there is no connection
between anyone who is released and any anticipation of a need for
space because of the possible influx of Central Americans.''
   However, he added, ``We would like to have the space to meet
such an influx if it happens.
   ``We are not going to go over capacity,'' at the detention
facilities, he said during a news conference. ``We are going to
live within our budget.''
   Illegal immigrants have been detained in south Texas while the
government processes their requests for political asylum.
   INS spokesman Verne Jervis in Washington said more than 500
Central Americans were apprehended in south Texas in the first two
weeks of January, compared to about 500 for all of December.
Seasonal factors, such as people returning from family visits over
Christmas, may account for some of the increase, Jervis said.
   Hundreds of detainees were authorized to leave south Texas over
the past two weeks if they can provide a U.S. address where they
have family, and agree to present themselves to the INS office
nearest their destination.
   Allowing such travel is a departure from the policy instituted
last Feb. 21 after thousands arrived in Texas primarily from
Nicaragua and El Salvador.
   Immigrants were prohibited from leaving the area because most
never reported to immigration officials in other cities. Instead,
the immigrants were sent to detention camps while their
applications for asylum were processed.
   At one point, more than 2,400 people were in detention last
year, either awaiting an asylum ruling, appealing a ruling or
awaiting an appearance before an immigration judge.
   The law says those without immigration documents may stay if
they can prove they fled their homelands for political and not
economic reasons.
   There were 1,046 detainees, primarily Central Americans, at the
immigration detention center near Bayview on Thursday. Another 697
people were detained Thursday in five other facilities in the lower
Rio Grande Valley.
   INS Harlingen District Director Jerry Sewell said he was unable
to elaborate on whether the agency had changed the policy
prohibiting asylum-seekers from leaving south Texas unless given
asylum.
   ``Detention space is a problem and we're trying to develop ways
to solve it,'' Sewell said.

   A high school senior arrested near the White
House allegedly selling cocaine that President Bush later used as a
prop in a speech has been convicted of three counts of drug
distribution.
   A U.S. District Court jury declared itself deadlocked Thursday
on a charge against Keith Jackson based on an alleged drug sale
Sept. 1 to undercover Drug Enforcement Administration agents in
Lafayette Square.
   But it convicted him of three counts of distributing drugs in
other locations.
   The president held up the plastic bag seized in the Lafayette
Park incident during his televised Sept. 5 antidrug speech, saying
it had been seized in an arrest in the park just across
Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House.
   The government's first attempt to convict Jackson ended in a
mistrial earlier this month when another jury declared itself
deadlocked on all the charges.
   A DEA agent testified that he was asked to set up a drug deal
near the White House.
   Jackson, 18, will face at least 12 years in federal prison
without parole, said U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens.
   The incidents for which Jackson was convicted occurred at
locations in Washington that were several miles from the White
House.

<HEAD>Effort to Suspend Governor Tied to Coup Blocked by Supporters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supporters of a provincial governor
linked to last month's coup attempt sealed off a northern capitol
building today and prevented the government from enforcing a
suspension order against him.
   Also today, intelligence agents arrested two renegade military
officers involved in the coup attempt in separate raids in the
Manila area, the military said. In all, three coup leaders have
been arrested since Wednesday.
   President Corazon Aquino has been struggling to consolidate her
power following the Dec. 1-9 coup attempt, and arresting and
prosecuting those responsible, especially in the military, is
considered crucial to that effort.
   The coup attempt, which was put down with tactical support from
U.S. warplanes, killed at least 113 people and injured more than
500.
   Elsewhere in the nation, unidentified youths today ambushed two
cars carrying Red Cross workers in the southern Philippines,
killing a Swiss and a Filipino volunteer, a spokesman for the
relief organization said.
   In Tuguegarao, 200 miles north of Manila, scores of youthful
suppporters of Gov. Rodolfo Aguinaldo prevented troops from
entering the capitol building of Cagayan province to enforce a
60-day suspension order.
   Aguinaldo denied a claim by Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos that
he had agreed to accept a suspension while he is investigated in
connection with the coup attempt. He refused to step aside and turn
over his office to Vice Gov. Melvin Vargas. The government says
Aguinaldo threatened to send troops and tanks to Manila to support
the December bid to oust Mrs. Aquino.
   In the Manila area, intelligence agents arrested two cashiered
military captains, Pacifico Avenido and Rogelio Seradoy, officials
said.
   Avenido was arrested without incident in a suburban parking lot,
a Philippine Constabulary spokesman, Lt. Col. Criscencio Maralit,
said.
   Avenido was dismissed from the service for involvement in a
previous coup attempt and has been in hiding since.
   Hours earlier, agents arrested renegade Capt. Rogelio Seradoy in
a soldier's housing area at Villamor air base, the camp commander,
Col. Manuel Oxales, said. Oxales said Seradoy was driving a jeep
with a female civilian when arrested. Oxales did not say whether
the companion was arrested.
   Seradoy was under arrest in connection with the Aug. 28 coup
attempt when he escaped last month.
   Robert Gates, President Bush's deputy national security adviser,
conferred today with Ramos and afterward repeated that the
Philippines government enjoys full American support. Gates told
reporters he conveyed ``the strong personal commitment of President
Bush to democracy in the Philippines and the constitutioanl
process.''
   On southern Mindanao island, four youths ambushed a car and
killed Walter Berweger, the head of the Red Cross on the island,
and his driver, Juanito Patong, said Paul Fruh, information
delegate of Red Cross.
   Another Filipino volunteer was seriously wounded, he said.
   Fruh said the incident took place outside the town of Buldon,
550 miles southeast of Manila. Moslem separatists and Communist
guerrillas are waging separate rebellions in the area.

<TEXT>
   Antonio Cipollone died five days after his
unprecedented jury award against the tobacco industry for the death
of his first wife was overturned by an appeals court. He was 66.
   ``He knew about it in the hospital,'' said his second wife,
Dorothy. ``It didn't seem to concern him in the least. He never got
up-tight about anything.''
   Cipollone, a retired Italian immigrant cable splicer, was pushed
onto front pages and television screens nationwide during the
highly publicized trial.
   He was admitted to Community Memorial Hospital in Toms River on
Jan. 4, a day before the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
overturned the $400,000 judgment awarded by a federal jury here in
June 1988.
   His wife said Cipollone died Jan. 10 of pneumonia and heart
failure. He had a quadruple bypass operation in 1986.
   The appeals court ordered a new trial, opening the door for new
issues, and vacated the money damages assessed to Liggett Group
Inc., the first time relatives or victims of smoking-related
diseases recovered from a cigarette concern.
   Cipollone had carried on the suit brought by him and his first
wife, Rose, who died at 58 of lung cancer in 1984. The suit named
Liggett, Lorillard Inc. and Philip Morris Inc., which made the
cigarettes Rose Cipollone smoked.
   ``He was happy that he had gone through with whatever his wife
Rose had started. He never had regrets,'' said Dorothy Cipollone.
   In addition to his wife, Cipollone's survivors include a son and
two daughters from his marriage to Rose.
   Born Aug. 31, 1923 in a small village in Italy between Rome and
Naples, Cipollone immigrated to this country at age 15. He and Rose
met at an outdoor opera, soon moved to the Bronx borough in New
York City.
   Cipollone, who was buried Saturday, is also survived by a son
and two daughters.

<HEAD>Student Bride, Catholic School Compromise on Expulsion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A teen-ager expelled from a Roman Catholic high
school for getting married will be allowed to graduate, but she
will have to do it by mail.
   ``Elizabeth Valeri will become an extension student of Maria
High School, which provides credit for high school correspondence
courses,'' said a statement released Thursday by the 17-year-old
and the school.
   ``Courses completed in this manner will enable Elizabeth to
satisfy all requirements for her Catholic high school scholastic
record,'' the statement added.
   Elizabeth was kicked out of Maria when she and her husband,
Xavier, 20, were pictured in a local newspaper as the first couple
to marry in Cook County in 1990.
   The school said earlier that Elizabeth's marriage outside the
church and before graduation, ``while not illegal, does not
constitute an appropriate example for other students.''
   The school's principal, Sister Grace Ann, said Elizabeth knew
when she wed that she defied a school policy barring married
students from attending classes.
   She would be living a different lifestyle from her classmates,
the principal said after Elizabeth was ordered not to attend
classes but to receive separate tutoring for mid-term exams.
   Elizabeth contended her lifestyle had not changed. She said she
and her husband, who were married in a civil ceremony, would live
with their respective parents until their vows were sanctified by
the church.
   The bride's attorney, Robert Shindler, said earlier this month
that the policy represented ``discrimination on the basis of
marital status.''
   He threatened a lawsuit unless his client received a written
apology, was allowed to graduate and was readmitted to classes.
   ``We're glad we could reach this settlement and that it's over
and she can go on enjoying her family and her friends and her
17-year-old's life,'' Shindler said by telephone.
   The statement said neither side would make any further public
comments on the matter. A spokesman for the school didn't return a
phone call Thursday.

Status</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Imprisoned soul singer James Brown
technically is eligible for a work release program today, but he
won't be released because South Carolina authorities have questions
about his Georgia sentence.
   ``Back in January he was sentenced in Georgia to a total of six
years and three months, which was to run concurrently with his
South Carolina sentence of six years and six months,'' Department
of Corrections spokesman Francis X. Archibald said Thursday.
   ``When it comes to work release, our laws are different, and we
have asked his attorney to get his Georgia status clear. We haven't
heard back,'' he said.
   Brown, 56, was jailed a year ago today for aggravated assault
and failing to stop for police. He already was on probation for a
guilty plea involving carrying an unlawful pistol, resisting arrest
and pleading no contest for possession of the hallucinogenic drug
phencyclidine, or PCP.
   ``At this point, I really don't have enough information to
discuss what will happen,'' said Brown's lawyer, Buddy Dallas of
Thomson, Ga. ``It's just bureaucracy. The only way to complicate
this any more is to get a third state involved in it.
   ``Mr. Brown is in the hands of South Carolina officials. His
fate and his future is in the hands of the South Carolina
Department of Corrections. Whatever the appropriate officials there
decide is appropriate will be appropriate and nothing has been
decided yet _ not even whether he will get into a work release
program.''
   Unofficially, prison officials say they understand that Brown
will not be eligible for parole in Georgia until 1992. If that is
the case, he would not be eligible for work release in South
Carolina until March.
   If Brown does leave prison on work release, it will be for
daytime hours only for work in South Carolina. He has been offered
numerous jobs, including one with a Columbia trolley company that
wants to use Brown to bring people to concerts at Williams-Brice
Stadium.

<TEXT>
   East German Communist Party factions today
demanded the party's dissolution, and the interim president said
the pro-democracy opposition should help run the caretaker
government until elections in May.
   Several thousand people demonstrated today in the cities of
Leipzig, Suhl and Frankfurt an der Oder to press for demands that
included better education and higher wages, the official news
agency ADN said.
   The actions came as the Bonn government, increasingly disturbed
by the flow of East Germans resettling in the West, blamed the
Communists for the country's woes and insisted on eventual German
unity as the solution.
   The developments indicate how difficult East Germany's road to
reform has been since a pro-democracy revolution ousted hard-line
Communist leader Erich Honecker on Oct. 18, opened the Berlin Wall,
and set up a coalition government that is trying to lead the
country until democratic elections are held in May.
   Interim President Manfred Gerlach, a non-Communist, said the
opposition could take over some of the 16 Cabinet seats held by the
Communists or the three Christian Democratic seats. The Christian
Democrats have threatened to pull out of the shaky, 27-member
coalition goverment of Communists and parties that have
traditionally allied with them.
   In a statement released today in East Berlin, several Communist
Party movements demanded the party's ``uncompromising dissolution
under public control.''
   The party, whose membership has plunged from 2.3 million to 1.4
million in six months, is wracked by internal squabbles.
   ``The delegates to the extraordinary party congress (held in
December) should again be summoned to agree to the dissolution,''
said the statement, carried by ADN.
   It did not say how many party members supported it, but it
listed seven Communist factions.
   More than 1,800 East Germans continue to resettle in West
Germany each day, threatening the Bonn government's ability to
feed, house and give jobs to the newcomers.
   Reflecting concern over the instability in East Germany, West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chief of staff on Thursday demanded
a clear commitment to German unity from the East Berlin leadership.
   The official, Rudolf Seiters, said the Communists were
``guilty'' of a ``lack of willingness to introduce fundamental
political and economic reforms.''
   ``With every day that passes, the chances of a lasting recovery
of the economy in the GDR (East Germany) worsen,'' Seiters said.
   ``This is due to the fact that the highly qualified manpower
which has left is urgently needed within its own country. The last
thing which the GDR can now afford is further bloodletting.''
   The more than 340,000 East Germans who have resettled in West
Germany are mostly young, skilled workers.
   Strikes and demonstrations have kept up the pressure on the
Communist Premier Hans Modrow's government, while boosting the
leverage of opposition forces.
   In order to join a caretaker government, the opposition has
demanded participation in overseeing a dismantling of the dreaded
secret police, and a right to speak in Parliament. Negotiators
quickly approved resolutions backing both demands.
   
   Modrow appealed to his coalition partners to hold the government
together until the nation's first free elections set for May,
spokesman Wolfgang Meyer said.
   In Bonn, Seiters spelled out West Germany's vision of the next
steps toward a united Germany.
   He told lawmakers that shortly after the May elections, Bonn
will seek a treaty arrangement with East Berlin.
   ``The treaty arrangement is the first step toward confederative
structures which are to lead to a federal structure in Germany,''
Seiters said, emphasizing that Kohl intends to keep pushing for
German unity.
   ``This view (of unity) must be made very clear in the treaty
that is to be worked out,'' Seiters said. ``We hope that a freely
elected Parliament in the German Democratic Republic will
strengthen such a view for the solution of the German question and
thus the goal of German national unity.''
   Modrow himself first called for closer treaty ties, although the
Communist premier said he was insisting on an independent East
German state.
   The East German Social Democrats, considered the most likely to
head the government after the May elections, have said they favor
German unity and want to start talks on the issue as soon as
possible following the vote.

   The Communist Party has called for a multiparty system,
parliamentary democracy, and religious freedom in Bulgaria. The
proposals are contained in a party statement that will be voted on
at a party congress beginning Jan. 30. It also calls for
eliminating the Communists' ``Marxist-Leninist'' label. The changes
are in line with the Communists' efforts to shed the Stalinist
image left over from the 34-year rule of hard-line leader Todor

   Sen. Spark M. Matsunaga, D-Hawaii, disclosed
today that he is undergoing treatment for prostate cancer.
   ``I can't conclude at this juncture that this condition is
debilitating to the extent that I should step down,'' Matsunaga,
73, said in a statement.
   But ``if it appears that my attendance in the second session of
the 101st Congress does not show marked improvement over the record
of the first session, I will reassess my present intention of
fulfilling my term of office,'' he said.
   Matsunaga, whose third term expires in 1994, had a ``string of
illnesses'' last year that caused him to miss roll call votes, said
spokesman Ed Greaney. Among those problems were shingles, a broken
leg and, most recently, a broken right arm.
   Matsunaga disclosed the illness to his staff after his release
Thursday from Walter Reed Army Medical Center, where he had spent
10 days because of the broken arm he suffered in a household
accident.
   The statement did not say when Matsunaga learned of the prostate
cancer or how it was being treated.
   Before his election to the Senate, Matsunaga served 14 years in
the House.

<DATELINE>DURHAM, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sister of one of the hostages being held
in Lebanon says government officials tell her Americans don't care
about the captives' fate, but she disagrees.
   ``Two words I have come to hate are `political expediency,'''
Peggy Say, the sister of hostage Terry Anderson, told newspaper
editors at a meeting of The North Carolina Associated Press
Thursday.
   ``I have been told numerous times that people just don't care,
but I am convinced that the only ones who don't care are the ones
who don't know about them,'' she said.
   Anderson, the chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, was kidnapped on March 16, 1985. He was last seen in a
videotaped message to his family in October 1988.
   ``I have no reason to believe since a year ago last October that
Terry Anderson is alive, but I'm counting on him to be,'' she said.
``You can't live without hope ... and a little bit of faith in my
government, that they are trying to bring these hostages out.''
   Mrs. Say, who has made several trips to the Middle East seeking
the release of her brother, said families of the hostages want the
government to use ``positive pressure'' to work for the release of
the eight Americans still held in Lebanon.
   Although the government has a policy against negotiating with
terrorists, Mrs. Say said that did not stop negotiations for the
release of hijacked airline passengers and the Achille Lauro cruise
ship.
   The hostages' location may be a secret, she added, but there is
little mystery about who is holding them and that Iran is behind
those terrorists.
   ``I know who Terry Anderson's guards are _ what their names are
and where they live,'' she said.
   She said released hostages have told her that guards hold guns
to the heads of the captives every time there is a knock on the
door. A rescue attempt would lead to the hostages' deaths, she
feels.
   ``Terry told one of the hostages later released that he hadn't
gone through all this to die in a rescue attempt,'' Mrs. Say said.
``What it's going to take is government-to-government discussions.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush is trying to blunt the momentum
of a politically appealing plan to cut Social Security taxes,
arguing it would force either an increase in other taxes or a
reduction in retirement benefits.
   Bush called the proposal a ``charade'' Thursday. Vice President
Dan Quayle said it was ``a political trap'' and ``a subterfuge for
a general tax increase.''
   The target of the White House attack was a proposal by Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., to roll back the Social Security
payroll tax increase that began Jan. 1.
   Moynihan's plan has put Bush on the spot because it has won
support across the political spectrum, even from traditional allies
of the president such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and
conservative groups.
   Moreover, it has exposed Bush to criticism that he is espousing
a tax cut for the rich with a proposed cut in capital gains taxes,
while spurning a break for middle- and low-income Americans with a
reduction in Social Security taxes.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell said today that he
believes Moynihan's proposal dramatized ``inequities and
regressiveness in the American tax system,'' but he stopped short
of endorsing it.
   The Maine Democrat said he has asked staff aides to study the
budgetary impact of rolling back the Social Security payroll tax
and said he would not make a decision on whether to support the
bill until he has seen the results of the studies and has discussed
the issue with Moynihan.
   Bush, in his first comments on the proposal, said, ``This is an
effort to get me to try to raise taxes on the American people by
the charade of cutting them, or cut benefits.
   ``And I am not going to do it to the older people in this
country,'' Bush pledged.
   On the heels of Moynihan's measure, Sen. Ernest F. Hollings,
D-S.C., proposed a 5 percent value-added tax _ a national sales
levy _ to replace revenues lost by the Social Security tax cut and
Bush's own proposal to lower the tax on capital gains.
   Hollings' plan would raise $53 billion in 1991.
   Quayle said Hollings' proposal was proof that a tax increase
would be the result of reducing Social Security taxes.
   ``The cat's a little bit out of the bag right now,'' the vice
president said in an interview with The Associated Press.
   However, Moynihan was quoted in today's editions of The New York
Times as saying, ``It is not fair to say I want to raise taxes to
offset the Social Security tax cut.''
   He said the Social Security system ``edges on the sacred, and to
see its revenues debauched this way is an independent question that
stands apart from the budget deficit, a tax increase or any other
question.''
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater, lumping the
Moynihan and Hollings proposals together, said: ``First we had the
tax cut and now we have the tax increase. Can cuts in benefits be
far behind?''
   Moynihan's proposal would save workers $7 billion in Social
Security taxes this year and $55 billion in fiscal 1991.
   The payroll tax, paid by both employers and employees, rose to
7.65 percent Jan. 1 from 7.51 percent, and it is levied on wages up
to $51,300 instead of $48,000. That means a wage-earner could pay
as much as $3,924 in Social Security taxes this year, an increase
of about $319 from 1989.
   Moynihan argues that the payroll tax should be reduced because
mounting surpluses in the Social Security trust funds are being
used to help offset large budget deficits instead of being put away
for future retirement benefits.
   The surpluses are the result of a 1983 agreement between the
Reagan administration and Congress in which taxes were raised to
build up a pool of hundreds of billions of dollars to pay for baby
boomers' retirement costs in the next century.
   Moynihan's administrative assistant, Paul Browne, said Bush was
engaging in ``a scare tactic.''
   ``The notion that (a payroll tax cut) in any way hurts
recipients is nonsense. That's just flat wrong,'' Browne said.
   Quayle said Moynihan's proposal gives Republicans their first
opportunity to appear as the protector of Social Security.
   ``Let me tell you something, cut these taxes the way that
Moynihan is talking about, you have to cut benefits at some time,
and the president and the Republican Party now have an opportunity
to show the American people, once and for all, that the Republicans
are as committed to the integrity of this Social Security trust
fund as anybody,'' Quayle said.

<TEXT>
   Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater
advised GOP candidates today to face the abortion issue squarely,
without ``vacillation, waffling or doubletalk,'' saying voters will
accept differences but not ducking.
   ``In 1990, no candidate can run for office without squarely
facing the abortion issue,'' Atwater told the winter meeting of the
Republican National Committee.
   President Bush, the party platform and Atwater all are firm
opponents of abortion, but the GOP chairman said that doesn't mean
all Republican candidates have to agree.
   ``There is no litmus test on any issue which would be grounds
for repudiating a Republican who believes in our overall philosophy
...,'' Atwater said.
   The issue figured in Republican defeats for two governorships in
1989, and ever since, Atwater has been telling his party that its
candidates must stake out their own positions clearly and early.
Otherwise, he said, Democrats will define the issue in their terms.
   ``What no voter likes is vacillation, waffling or doubletalk,''
Atwater said today. ``And they don't like the appearance of
vacillation, waffling or doubletalk.''
   He said the Republican Party ``is big enough to accommodate
different views,'' saying that is one of the growing pains involved
in becoming a majority.
   Atwater and other Republican leaders have been recommending that
handling of the abortion issue ever since the defeats of 1989.
   Vice President Dan Quayle said Thursday that people on all sides
of the abortion issue can be comfortable in the Republican Party,
but there was a distinct level of discomfort at the national
committee meeting.
   Idaho Republican chairman Randy Ayre was swiftly rebuffed
Thursday when he tried to get the party to adopt a resolution
reaffirming the 1988 GOP platform stance in opposition to abortion.
   Republicans are trying to cope with a turnaround in the impact
of the issue after a decade in which the anti-abortion stance was
ascendant and candidates espousing pro-choice views were on the
defensive.
   But pro-choice activists were energized by a Supreme Court
ruling last summer that opened the way for states to enact
restrictions on access to abortions.
   In an interview in his White House office, Quayle reaffirmed his
support for the 1988 platform but then added that Republicans ``are
a party of inclusion ... the tent is big enough to include pro-life
as well as pro-choice.''
   ``The president has already campaigned for a number of
pro-choice Senate candidates. He will continue to support the
Republican candidate no matter whether pro-life or pro-choice,''
Quayle said.
   Despite the 1989 election results, President Bush has maintained
a strong anti-abortion position, vetoing two bills that would have
allowed the use of federal funds for abortions in cases of rape and
incest.
   Quayle said that on abortion the GOP was ``becoming more like
the traditional Democratic Party, that is that we are inclusive
rather than exclusive. I have a hunch the Democratic Party really
runs the risk of being more single-issue than the Republican
Party.''
   The vice president added that ``pro-choice Republicans don't
feel uncomfortable in our party _ if they do, they shouldn't.''
   When Ayre offered his resolution, he was told that his request
would not be considered because he had not submitted a formal
resolution in advance of the gathering, and that perhaps the issue
would be discussed at the next RNC meeting in June.
   ``But we have elections coming up,'' he told the RNC's
resolutions committee.
   After the session, Ayre said that while he personally opposes
abortion and believes the party should too, he did not believe the
GOP should not use a candidate's position on abortion as a litmus
test for party support.
   ``I just feel that we should reaffirm the party's longstanding
position on the issue,'' he said.
   But one RNC member, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
party officials were reluctant to stir new interest in an issue
that could hurt many GOP candidates in the 1990 elections.
   ``Those who are pro-life can point to the 1988 platform and
those pro-choice can point to the president's remarks about
inclusion,'' he said. ``It does us no good to stir this thing up.''

   Rusty Hamer, the child actor in the
television series ``Make Room for Daddy'' in the 1950s and '60s,
has died at age 42 of an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound,
his brother said.
   Hamer was found dead in his home Thursday.
   ``He was a very unhappy, very confused young man,'' John Hamer
said. ``No one does something like that if they aren't confused.
I've heard of a lot of child actors who have become unhappy with
their lives after they've left the industry.''
   Rusty Hamer apparently shot himself in the head with a
.357-caliber Magnum revolver, said the sheriff office's Chief
Detective Robert McCullough.
   ``There was no indication of any foul play,'' McCullough said.
   On the TV series, Rusty Hamer played the part of Rusty, and
Danny Thomas played his father, a nightclub singer and comedian.
   Hamer had his first movie role at the age of 5, and appeared in
several Abbott and Costello films, John Hamer said.
   The Danny Thomas show was one of television's most durable and
popular situation comedies. Most of the cast, including Hamer,
returned in 1970-71 with a sequel, ``Make Room For Granddaddy,'' in
which Rusty was a married medical student.
   John Hamer, who also was a child actor, said his brother was in
debilitating physical and emotional pain for years but refused to
see a doctor.
   Rusty Hamer worked for a Los Angeles messenger service when he
left Hollywood at the age of 20, bitter and depressed, said John
Hamer. After moving to this southwest Louisiana town, his jobs
included delivering a newspaper, working offshore for Exxon, and
occasional work at his brother's restaurant.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

<TEXT>
   The Navy says arson is suspected in a
fire aboard the aircraft carrier USS Forrestal that injured 11
sailors and caused an estimated $2.5 million in damage, a newspaper
reported today.
   ``Most logically, the fire was intentionally set,'' said the
report, which was obtained by The Florida Times-Union in a Freedom
of Information Act request.
   But Navy investigators have not determined who set the fire,
which occurred Oct. 9 while the ship was docked at Mayport Naval
Station, northeast of Jacksonville. They said they found no
evidence that it started accidentally.
   Investigators also said materials used to clean up a fuel spill
from the carrier four days earlier were improperly stored on the
ship.
   No arrests have been made and the Navy investigation is
continuing.
   The fire broke out three days before the Forrestal was to leave
on a six-month deployment to the Mediterranean. Repairs delayed the
start of the deployment until Nov. 3.
   A Navy spokesman in Washington, Lt. Frank Thorp, said he could
not speculate on whether the fire could have been set in an attempt
to delay the ship's departure.
   The fire started in an air intake in the ship's No. 1 main
machinery room on the second deck. Fueled by the oil-cleanup
material, the fire spread through electrical cable to an aircraft
elevator machinery room, then ignited a fire off one of the
carrier's hangar bays.
   Smoke spread through the carrier, forcing the evacuation of
1,000 sailors.
   The fire affected some navigation, aircraft elevator control and
weapons systems components and left some parts of the ship without
electricity for several days.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today dismissed as
untruthful an Amnesty International report that accused South
Korean authorities of torturing prisoners and committing other
human rights violations.
   In a statement, the government said the London-based human
rights organization has ``naively taken at face value one-sided and
often malicious assertions.''
   Amnesty International's report on human rights violations last
year in South Korea contained ``serious factual errors, unrealistic
assertions and suggestions which disregard the nation's legal
system,'' it said. The statement called the allegations
``untruthful.''
   In its report, Amnesty International said torture and other
violations under the government of President Roh Tae-woo last year
had reversed a two-year trend of human rights improvements in South
Korea.
   The human rights group also said 800 political and labor
activists have been arrested in a crackdown on political opposition
by Roh's government and thousands more briefly detained for
particiaption in demonstrations and industrial strikes.
   Hundreds of prisoners were believed being held for political
reasons at the end of 1989, and another 200 political prisoners
have been held for between one and 39 years, Amnesty said.
   The government maintained South Korea has no prisoners of
conscience and ``only those who threatened the rule of law and
national survival by willfully violating the established law'' have
been imprisoned.
   ``Amnesty International's arbitrary definition of them as
prisoners of conscience who must be released can only be deemed to
be based on an ignorance or misunderstanding of the facts,'' it
said.
   Roh has introduced broad reforms since he took office, but last
year his government began taking firm action against radical
students and dissidents. Public support for the radicals has waned
because of their ideological extremism and violent tactics.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The main exit from Panama is not the
swiftest.
   Nearly a month after U.S. troops invaded the country, security
at Panama's airport befits more a prison than a way station for
international flights.
   The Omar Torrijos International Airport is, for all practical
purposes, closed to the public. It belongs to U.S. troops, armored
cars, tanks, German shepherds and other bomb-sniffing creatures.
   The obstacle course includes more than the usual metal detectors
and document checks. For one passenger, it included getting by an
incontinent dog.
   The planes do take off, but passengers are advised to check in
at least five hours before departure. If not, too bad, you may miss
your flight.
   Most top aides and officers to Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega,
toppled after the Dec. 20 invasion, are believed to have
surrendered or sought asylum in various foreign embassies in Panama
City.
   But some Noriega cronies are still on the loose, and U.S. forces
aren't taking any chances that they'll slip out of the country
carrying a boarding pass.
   ``We've gotten most of the Defense Forces, but not all,'' said
Army Col. James Swank, spokesman for the U.S. Southern Command.
   Among the top members of Noriega's Defense Forces still on the
lam is Lt. Col. Luis Cordoba, the former police intelligence head
linked to the grisly 1985 murder of Noriega opponent Hugo
Spadafora, whose headless body was found in Costa Rica.
   The capital is rife with rumors that Cordoba has taken to the
mountains to wage a guerrilla war against U.S. troops and the new
government of President Guillermo Endara.
   Cordoba might also be in hiding. But if he's waiting for an
airplane, he's out of luck.
   An airline passenger can't just drive to the airport, park the
car and check in at the counter.
   At least five hours before the plane takes off, travelers are
told to be at the huge pink Atlapa Convention Center, 15 miles from
the airport, where tickets, passports and visas are checked.
   If all the information fits with rosters and computer lists, the
travelers get a boarding card and a luggage ticket stub.
   Then they're told to wait for a bus that will drive them to
airport, at a cost of $5.
   The airport's entrance is sealed off with sandbags, barbed wire
and tanks. Before the bus is allowed in, a soldier hops on and
inspects passports and tickets.
   If there are no suspicious characters, the bus can go in.
   ``Don't get off the bus yet. Stay inside until we tell you to,''
a Panamanian woman admonishes impatient travelers.
   The luggage is taken off and lined up neatly next to a door.
Then and only then, passengers can step down. One by one, they pick
out their suitcases. Not more than two are allowed per passenger,
and there are no porters.
   Step 1: Passenger and suitcase go through metal detector and
X-ray.
   Step 2: Suitcases are lined in a row and opened. Passengers sit
down and watch.
   Step 3: Dog No. 1 sniffs each suitcase and purse.
   Step 4: Dog No. 2 sniffs the same suitcases, again.
   Step 5: Panamanian security guard goes through each suitcase
with hands.
   Step 6: Passengers try to close suitcase back up.
   The procedure is not always smooth. One dog decides to do more
than sniff and urinates on a suitcase full of photography
chemicals. The U.S. K-9 officer merely yanks the dog's chain and
sets it to sniffing again.
   Amid raucous laughter, the dog, male, starts paying more
attention to a fellow security dog, female.
   ``I'm never coming back to Panama as long as I live,'' says a
Honduran woman looking on.
   The luggage then goes on the plane. But not the passenger.
   First a $15 airport tax must be paid, then exit visas are
checked. At another glass booth, visas, passports, ticket and
boarding pass are rechecked.
   The worst is over. One more X-ray. One more metal detector.
   Soldiers with machine guns and dogs on leashes mingle with
passengers until the plane can be boarded.
   But even after everyone is on board, the checks go on.
   Outside, an official-looking man talks with the crew and boards
the plane.
   A passenger is told: ``Come with me, please.''
   Before the plane can take off, his luggage must be removed from
the cargo bay. That takes 45 minutes.

<HEAD>Ex-Employees Didn't Prove Wiretap Allegations, Bell Lawyer Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN NOLAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two former Cincinnati Bell Telephone Co.
installers have failed to support their accusations that the
company engaged in illegal wiretapping, Cincinnati Bell's attorney
argued today.
   Lawyer Arnold Morelli said Leonard Gates and Robert Draise had
changed their stories, forgotten key dates and ``bumped into
facts'' during their testimony alleging two company supervisors and
police directed them to install wiretaps.
   ``No corroboration _ nobody supports their stories,'' Morelli
told the jury in closing arguments. ``It is all a figment of their
imaginations.''
   Morelli also noted that the former employees declined to take
``lie detector'' tests, while the company supervisors _ Peter Gabor
and James West _ voluntarily submitted to the examinations.
   Gates and Draise say the company is trying to cover up that they
were ordered to perform 1,200 wiretaps between 1972 and 1984, at
first for Cincinnati police and later by Cincinnati Bell
supervisors.
   The company denies any involvement with illegal wiretaps, and
filed a defamation lawsuit against Gates and Draise.
   Hamilton County Common Pleas Judge Fred J. Cartolano planned to
instruct the jury on the law after Gates and Draise completed their
closing arguments today. Closing arguments in the eight-week trial
began Thursday.
   As he did throughout the trial, Morelli on Thursday emphasized
the employees' inconsistencies and discrepancies. Morelli said
Gates has changed his story three times about which supervisor
supposedly ordered him to tap the phone of President Ford during a
1975 visit to Cincinnati.
   ``A liar has to have a terrific memory,'' Morelli said. ``To
attempt to establish lies takes a lot of time and a lot of work.
They have been inconsistent, and they have contradicted
themselves.''
   Gates and Draise are defending themselves in the defamation
trial. Draise told jurors in closing arguments Thursday that they
must find in the employees' favor to prevent companies from
retaliating against whistleblowers.
   ``You have the ability to send Bell and other companies a
message: we're not going to stand for it,'' Draise said.
   Gates admitted Thursday that his memory about the years of
supposed wiretaps is hazy, but he said anyone would have trouble
remembering such details many years later. He also said Cincinnati
Bell had only complimentary things to say about him in his work
appraisals before he went public with the wiretap allegations.
   ``Look through my appraisals,'' Gates told the jurors. ``In 23
years, Cincinnati Bell has never called me a liar.''
   Cincinnati Bell contends that Gates and Draise lied to get
revenge against the company because Gates was fired in 1986 and
Draise in 1979. Cincinnati Bell, its parent, Cincinnati Bell Inc.,
and two of the phone company's managers, James West and Peter
Gabor, sued to challenge the wiretapping claims. Gates and Draise
countersued, saying they were injured because Cincinnati Bell
officials called them liars.
   Cartolano on Wednesday dismissed the defamation lawsuit that
Gates and Draise filed against Cincinnati Bell. The jury now must
decide only the original lawsuit the company filed against the two
former installers.

with Martin Marietta job cuts.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The Boeing Co. plans to reduce its Seattle-area
work force by 5,000 people this year although the company has
record orders for commercial jets with deliveries stretching into
the next century.
   Better East-West relations have cast doubt on the future of
Boeing's defense business and fewer production workers are needed
on the company's 747-400 jumbo jets, Boeing officials said Thursday.
   Boeing wants to build a new widebody jet, the 777, but no orders
have been announced and production startup is at least two years
away.
   The aerospace giant said it hopes to accomplish half the cuts
through retirement and resignations.
   The Martin Marietta Astronautics Group also announced plans
Thursday to cut about 200 jobs by the end of February, but will
transfer many workers to other posts within the aerospace giant, a
company spokeswoman said in Denver.
   Positions that cannot be directly tied to a contract will be
affected, and will be eliminated possibly through a combination of
full-time and part-time jobs, said spokeswoman Judy Stowell.
   A review of business propects for 1990 showed the company needed
to cut overhead labor costs, Stowell said. The company employes
about 11,500 workers in Colorado, and other Martin divisions employ
3,600 workers.
   Boeing's announcement came about two months after the company
and union workers settled a 48-day strike, which was mainly over
wages and mandatory overtime. About 43,000 Seattle area union
workers were affected by the strike.
   Boeing said it will give layoff notices today to about 1,900
employees who might be among some 1,700 workers who will lose jobs
starting March 20. The balance of the workers are to be laid off
later in the year.
   Boeing has a backlog of more than 1,700 commercial jets worth
about $85 billion. Last year, it added 10,000 employees in the
Puget Sound area and was so strapped for production workers on its
747-400 that it borrowed 600 machinists from Lockheed.
   That startup and certification work has been completed and the
extra workers are no longer needed, Boeing said. Delays and
uncertainties on other projects, especially defense work, mean the
lost jobs cannot be absorbed elsewhere in the company, it said.
   About 1,400 of the 1,700 hourly employees to be laid off are at
the company's Everett plant north of Seattle, where widebody 747s
and 767s are built. Most of the others probably will be defense
workers, Boeing spokesman Paul Binder said.
   Thursday's announcement didn't mention possible job losses at
Boeing plants outside the Puget Sound region.
   The company has a large military and commercial plant at
Wichita, Kan., a helicopter division at Philadelphia, a space
center at Huntsville, Ala., and smaller operations scattered
throughout the country.
   At year end, Boeing had just under 106,700 employees in
Washington state. Nationwide, its employment had grown to 145,200,
up 10,800 from the beginning of the year.

   The Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, the guru who
drew thousands of followers to central Oregon by preaching a blend
of Eastern religion, pop psychology and free love, died today of
heart failure, his spokesman said. He was 58.
   Rajneesh, known as Osho Rajneesh in recent years, died at his
commune in the southern city of Poona, where he settled after being
deported from the United States in 1985.
   ``Osho left his body at 5:30 p.m. The doctors say it's heart
failure,'' spokesman Swami Chaitanya Kirti said in a telephone
interview. Disciples carried Rajneesh's body on their shoulders to
a funeral pyre built on a nearby riverbank, and it was cremated,
Kirti said.
   ``I don't think I ever wish anybody dead, but I wished many
times that he would go back where he belongs,'' said Jean Opray,
former mayor of the town of Antelope, Ore., which was taken over
for a time by Rajneesh's followers.
   Kirti said the guru had greeted followers Wednesday in the
Buddha Hall, his Indian commune's main prayer center, but did not
appear Thursday because of ``pain on the left side of his chest.''
   About 10,000 followers, mostly Westerners, were at the Poona
commune when Rajneesh died, Kirti said. Another of Rajneesh's
followers, Swami Prabhod, said the devotees burst into songs and
chants to celebrate Rajneesh's departure from his earthly body.
   ``Everybody is singing and celebrating,'' Prabhod said. Music
could be heard in the background as he spoke over the telphone from
Poona, 750 miles southwest of New Delhi.
   As ``the Bhagwan,'' a Hindi word for ``god,'' Rajneesh presided
over a 64,000-acre commune 120 miles east of Portland, Ore., from
1981 until 1985, when he pled guilty to violating federal
immigration laws.
   In its heyday, the commune known as Rajneeshpuram was home to
4,000 red-clad followers, who toiled 12 hours a day and showered
Rajneesh with jewels and Rolls-Royces that he used for daily drives
past lines of singing, clapping fans.
   In ``The Orange Book,'' which contains the guru's teachings,
Rajneesh advocated ``dynamic mediation.''
   ``Explode! Go totally mad ... Jump up and down shouting the
mantra `Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! ... Each time you land, on the flats of your
feet, let the sound hammer deep into the sex center,'' he wrote.
   The crowd at the commune swelled to 15,000 during summer
festivals, and residents of nearby communities resented the
intrusion. Rajneesh's top aide was eventually convicted in an
elaborate scheme designed to gain political control of the county.
   Rajneesh pleaded guilty in November 1985 to two counts of
violating immigration laws by arranging sham marriages to help his
foreign disciples remain in the United States illegally.
   Under a plea agreement, 33 other counts were dropped. Rajneesh
received a suspended 10-year sentence, paid a $400,000 fine, and
agreed not to return to the United States for five years without
the written permission of the U.S. attorney general.
   He took his throne with him when he left.
   Rajneesh returned to India but left after a month when the
government deported 10 of his aides.
   For six months he roamed the world in search of a home but was
turned away by 21 countries. In July 1986, he returned to Indian
and set up a commune.
   His headquarters in Poona were far humbler than the sprawling
ranch in the sage-brush dotted hills of central Oregon's high
desert. In Poona, Rajneesh was reduced to a six-acre commune.
   In December 1988, Rajneesh traded the Hindu honorific of Bhagwan
for Osho, a Buddhist term that means ``on whom the heavens shower
flowers.''
   Rajneesh had reversed his free love preaching in recent years
because of the danger of AIDS.
   He had been in failing health since leaving the United States
and often claimed that U.S. officials poisoned him while he was in
jail.
   The lavish Oregon commune, which included orchards, a vineyard,
a 65-acre vegetable farm, two lakes stocked with fish, and an
airport with a 4,500-foot paved runway, is now deserted. An
insurance company foreclosed on the property but never found a
buyer.
   Bernard Smith, district attorney of Oregon's Wasco County, said
today that Rajneesh's death marks ``the end of what was a pretty
unpleasant experience for most of us here.''
   Rajneeshpuram was incorporated as a city on part of the commune
in 1982. Disciples also moved into Antelope, a nearby town of 40
people, eventually holding all its elected offices and chaning its
name to City of Rajneesh.
   The Antelope name was restored in 1985 at Rajneesh's suggestion
in an effort to make peace with Oregonians.
   Rajneesh's utopia began to unravel in September 1985, when the
guru's personal secretary, Ma Anand Sheela, abruptly left.
   In October of that year, Rajneesh and Sheela were arrested. The
guru was taken into custody when two jets taking him to Bermuda
were surrounded at the Charlotte, N.C., airport.
   Sheela fled to West Germany and was brought back to the United
States. She pleaded guilty to a variety of charges, including
attempting to murder the guru's personal physician with a
poison-filled syringe.
   She also admitted orchestrating a food poisoning outbreak at
restaurants in The Dalles, the county seat, as part of a plot aimed
at gaining political control of the county.
   Sheela was sentenced to 4{ years in prison and ordered to be
deported when her sentence was served.
   Rajneesh's body, attired in the guru's customary flowing robes
and diamond-studded cap, was taken to the Buddha Hall three hours
after death and was heaped with roses, Rajneesh's favorite flowers,
Kirti said.
   ``There was no incense fixed because he hated its smell,'' he
added.

<HEAD>Cartel Releases Another Hostage, Tells Bush It Gives Up</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 3 grafs to UPDATE with White House rejecting drug
traffickers' plea; picks up 4th pvs, `The cocaine...'</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By STAN YARBRO</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The Medellin cartel released a hostage
with a message for President Bush pledging to end the drug trade,
but the White House today said the message would not persuade it to
deal with drug lords.
   ``Our position is still the same,'' said White House secretary
Marlin Fitzwater in Washington. ``We have traditionally been
opposed to deals with the cartel ... Essentially it's a matter for
Colombia to deal with.''
   The cartel released the hostage Thursday and two other hostages
on Wednesday, and in a communique it acknowledged defeat to the
government. It offered to stop its activities in exchange for an
amnesty.
   The cocaine lords have made such promises before, and major
newspapers and the government called for the war against drugs to
continue.
   In their message to Bush on Thursday, the Extraditables, a group
representing the Medellin cartel, said: ``We are going to release
all of our hostages.'' The group's name refers to drug suspects the
United States wants extradited to face charges.
   The Extraditables have kidnapped 85 people in the last 45 days.
Authorities estimate at least 18 remain in the hands of the cartel.
   The message was repeated from memory by Roberto Toro Gonzalez,
who was kidnapped on Dec. 14. Toro Gonzalez, 23, son of a wealthy
family that owns a chain of stores, said in a radio interview his
captors made him memorize the message before chaining him to the
window grating of a house in Medellin.
   Journalists from Colombia's two major radio networks, Caracol
and RCN, were tipped off by anonymous phone callers and arrived at
the scene shortly after Toro Gonzalez's captors drove off.
   In their message, the Extraditables asked Bush to take them at
their word.
   ``If President Bush and the men of the ... (U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration) do not believe the word of drug
traffickers, why do they negotiate with them and why do they let
them testify against other suspects?'' the message asked.
   The cartel apparently was referring to plea-bargaining
agreements often made between drug suspects and U.S. authorities.
   On Wednesday, the cartel freed Patricia Echavarria, the sister
of President Virgilio Barco's son-in-law, and her daughter. The
two, kidnapped in Medellin Dec. 16, carried the communique from the
traffickers conceding defeat.
   Leading politicians said the struggle was almost over.
   Two Liberal Party presidential candidates, Ernesto Samper and
William Jaramillo, said in declarations published Thursday in the
daily El Tiempo that the offensive had pushed traffickers into an
``unconditional surrender.''
   Their optimism was shared by Medellin Mayor Juan Gomez, who has
repeatedly called for negotiations with the Medellin cartel. El
Tiempo quoted Gomez as saying the traffickers' concession of defeat
was ``an important step toward peace.''
   But in its lead editorial, El Tiempo said the drug war had not
ended, although the government offensive was working.
   Since Barco ordered his crackdown in mid-August, authorities
have extradited 13 drug suspects to the United States. The
traffickers responded with a terror campaign that killed 209
people, including 107 who died when a bombed jet crashed outside
Bogota in November.
   Authorities also killed a leader of the Medellin cartel, Gonzalo
Rodriguez Gacha, in a gunfight.
   After the traffickers conceded defeat Wednesday, Interior
Minister Carlos Lemos Simmonds said the government would not be
tricked into ending its anti-drug offensive. He also said that
under no circumstances would the government negotiate with
traffickers or drop the policy of extraditing suspects to the
United States.

<HEAD>Valentino Becomes Fund-Raiser But Abandons Rome Runway</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIELA PETROFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Fashion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Valentino, king of Italian couture, has turned
mentor and benefactor.
   Beginning this spring, his Accademia Valentino _ a former school
of theology off the Spanish Steps in downtown Rome _ will have art
exhibits, concerts and other cultural activities.
   All proceeds from these events, which will also include private
fashion shows, will go to charity, mainly AIDS research and care of
AIDS victims.
   To inaugurate this philanthropic phase, Valentino invited
actress Elizabeth Taylor, chairman of the American Foundation for
AIDS Research, to be guest of honor at a cocktail party for 1,000
of Rome high society friends.
   At the soiree, he gave a preview of his spring-summer 1990 high
fashion collection that will be presented in Paris later this month.
   Apparently tired from the day's activities, which included a
visit to a home for AIDS victims, Ms. Taylor, wearing an aubergine
blue evening gown adorned with a diamond brooch, stayed at the
party just long enough Thursday evening to be photographed with the
designer, and then disappeared.
   The disappointed guests who were hoping for a closer look at the
actress were left with a glimpse at the new collection, as well as
his first art exhibit: 30 paintings and sculptures of the 20th
century ``scuola Romana'' that will travel to Moscow later this
year.
   If Valentino's debut in American-style fund-raising is the good
news, the bad news is that the golden boy of Italian couture is
abandoning the Roman runway, and moving to Paris.
   Already a year ago, Valentino rocked the couture crowd by
showing his new collection not only in Rome, but also in Paris. He
repeated this double feature fashion show in the summer.
   Citing dwindling international interest in the Rome couture
scene, indifference of Roman authorities to support the fashion
world _ the French Chambre Syndicale supports Parisian fashion both
morally and financially _ and the general state of confusion of
Rome as it prepares to host the World Cup Soccer championships this
summer, Valentino said it was not worth his while to show in Rome.
   He promises, however, to keep Rome as his headquarters and does
not rule out a return on the runway the future. He has been showing
his ready-to-wear collection exclusively in Paris for over a decade.
   What little Romans did see of the collection was beautiful.
Harking back to his famous ``white collection'' in Florence that
marked the beginning of his success story almost 30 years ago,
Valentino presented 19 white silk gowns and suits adorned with tiny
pleats, ruffles and a myriad of large mother of pearl and gold
buttons.
   The models stood in static positions, as if at a party, in one
of the reception rooms of the palazzo as the crowd filed past.
   Valentino is not alone in questioning the validity of the Rome
fashion week that used to draw the international press and jet set
twice a year when such names as Biki, Sorelle Fontana, Fabiani and
Capucci dictated Italian fashion mores.
   Several years ago, Rome fashion got a boost when Milanese
designer Gianfranco Ferre chose the capital to present his couture
collection. But last summer Ferre was lured to Paris to become
designer for the famed house of Dior.
   Other top names such as Balestra and Barocco have also
threatened to abandon ship if Rome authorities do not give them a
good reason to stay.
   In general the new look for spring-summer 1990 shown in Rome
this week is demure and romantic. Colors are springtime pastels,
and faded floral prints. The favorite fabric is silk chiffon and
ruffles and pleats abound. Models wear delicate makeup and long
wavy hairstyles.
   Most successful at this new look, and so far loyal to the Roman
runway, was Mila Schoen with a series of garden party silk gowns in
floral chiffon prints, with broad brimmed straw hats adorned with
matching silk flowers.
   In response to the cries for help from the Rome fashion crowd,
new Mayor Franco Carraro has promised to meet with leaders of the
Italian chamber of fashion to see what can be done to boost Italian
couture and keep the made-in-Italy label firmly rooted in the
Eternal City.

<HEAD>Premier Signs Regulations on Foreign Journalists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Li Peng on Friday signed new regulations
governing foreign journalists in China, the official Xinhua News
Agency said, but it did not disclose their contents.
   Foreign journalists were under tight restrictions in Beijing
during nearly eight months of martial law that ended Jan. 11. The
new regulations are expected to reimpose at least some of those
restrictions.
   The State Council, China's Cabinet, approved them on the same
day that martial law ended. Xinhua said the regulations were
necessary to ``supervise the activities of foreign journalists and
resident foreign news organizations.''
   The Foreign Ministry has refused to divulge their contents, and
Xinhua did not say if they take effect with Li's signing.
   Under martial law, foreign journalists were banned from
conducting interviews without army approval. All interview requests
had to be submitted to the city government, and weeks often passed
before a response was made, usually negative.
   The government expelled two foreign reporters based in Beijing
following its June 3-4 army crackdown on pro-democracy protesters,
and half a dozen visiting journalists. Police surveillance of
journalists, including audible telephone bugs, increased sharply
during the summer but appears to have relaxed recently.
   Information continues to be hard to get, however, because many
Chinese officials consider it politically risky to grant interviews.
   The Beijing city government, meanwhile, approved a regulation
forbidding books, magazines and audio or videotapes that ``violate
the fundamental principles of the constitution, are pornographic,
superstititious or contain other evils.''
   It reiterated that all book, magazine, newspaper and tape
sellers must be officially licensed, a requirement that has been
widely ignored in the past.
   Authorities nationwide have conducted an intensive campaign
since June against pornographic and politically suspect materials.
They have raided book stalls, burned tens of thousands of books and
magazines and shut down many book distributors and several

   A landing Eastern Airlines jet tore the top off a
twin-engine plane that touched down just before it, killing one
person aboard the smaller aircraft, officials said.
   None of the 149 people on the jet was injured in the accident on
a runway at Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport at 7:15 p.m.
Thursday, an Eastern spokesman said. The spokesman said a wing was
damaged on the jet, a Boeing 727.
   The collision involved Eastern Flight 111, which originated in
Montreal and stopped in New York, and a twin-engine Beechcraft King
Air 100 flying from a suburban airport. A second person aboard the
Beechcraft was injured.
   Both planes had been cleared to land, Federal Aviation
Administration spokesman Jack Barker said.
   Asked if that indicated a problem in the control tower, he
replied, ``That's under investigation.''
   ``Obviously something went wrong for two airplanes to hit each
other on the runway,'' Barker said. ``Everything involving the
movement of those two aircraft will be considered'' by federal
investigators.
   National Transportation Safety Board investigators from
Washington arrived today. Spokeswoman Drucella Andersen said they
would question witnesses, including the Eastern crew and the
smaller plane's injured co-pilot, and would examine air traffic
control tapes and Eastern's operating procedures.
   Under aircraft approach rules, ``the arriving aircraft cannot be
cleared to land until the preceding aircraft has left the runway,''
Ms. Andersen said. ``We won't speculate as to what this might mean.
I can't tell you what the cause is.''
   Roger Myers, another FAA spokesman, said the Eastern plane was
completing its landing as the Beechcraft still was taxiing on the
runway.
   ``The Eastern airliner landed behind him, and they collided on
the runway,'' Myers said. ``He (The Eastern pilot) was on his
landing roll,'' meaning the jet was still rolling to a stop.
   Barker said officials did not know how much time lapsed between
the two plane landings, although ``It was very close between the
two.''
   It isn't unusual for planes to land within two minutes of each
other at Hartsfield, which was the world's busiest airport in 1987
and ranked third last year, according to FAA figures. The airport
averaged 75 landings an hour on two runways in 1987, an airport
spokesman said then.
   It was the first pilot death at Hartsfield since three Delta Air
Lines crew members were killed in a 1958 accident, said Hartsfield
spokeswoman Rhonda Copenny. She said the huge airport has never had
a passenger fatality.
   Gene Griffin, an Eastern passenger from New York, said, ``The
plane veered to the left and hit something. I thought maybe it was
a pothole. No one was really sure what was going on, but no one was
really hurt or shaken up.''
   Those who witnessed the collision described it much differently.
   ``I seen this debris flying everywhere, terrible, just like it
flipped over and it was way up in the air _ terrible,'' said Rodney
Johnson, an airport ground worker.
   Airport spokesman John Braden said the jet coasted 2,000 feet
before stopping.
   The runway where the crash occurred was closed until National
Transportation Safety Board investigators would let airport workers
move the wreckage, probably sometime today, Braden said. Operations
continued normally on the other runways.
   There was a little rain and fog at the time of the collision,
but ``it was not bad weather,'' Braden said. He said he had not
talked to controllers in the tower about what might have happened.
   The Beechcraft was owned by Epps Air Service and based at DeKalb
Peachtree Airport on the edge of Atlanta. The two men aboard the
plane were Epps employees, Braden said.
   ``The top half of the plane was pretty well sheared off. ... The
engines are intact,'' Braden said. The tail section also was
missing.
   Killed was Eric Thomas, 30, of Acworth, Ga., and injured was
Daniel Olthoff, 26, of Norcross, Ga., said officials at the
hospital where both were taken. Olthoff was described as
``conscious, alert and talking.''
   ``Passengers on the Eastern flight are OK. No injuries,'' said
Eastern spokesman Robin Matell in Miami.
   Matell said the flight was carrying 141 passengers and a crew of
eight; Atlanta was its final destination. Matell said the Eastern
plane's captain, whose name was not released, had 23 years'
experience with the company.

   What does the man who has everything give
himself? A new, custom-built yacht that's bigger than a football
field and fitted with a Roman bath and amphitheater.
   Billionaire Donald Trump plans to treat himself to just that
with his custom-made 420-foot ``Trump Princess,'' which he expects
to unveil in 1992 after selling off the current, cramped 282-foot
version, said Trump spokesman Jeff Walker.
   The new boat is necessary because the present ``Trump Princess''
_ recognized in the Guinness Book of World Records as the longest
private yacht in the world _ has become too small for the Trumps to
entertain guests, Walker said.
   Trump is looking for a buyer for the 282-foot boat. Trump paid
$30 million for it; his asking price is $115 million.

   ``For me, this piece has worked as a kind of atonement, to start

   The display is part of the 100th anniversary of the church. The

   Lennon and Ono were married for 11 years until he was murdered
outside their Manhattan apartment in 1980.

   Mayor Marion Barry, arrested on a charge of
possessing crack cocaine, postponed indefinitely today announcement
of his candidacy for a fourth term, City Hall sources said.
   Elected officials and politicians were describing the mayor's
arrest as a crippling blow to his re-election bid, already facing
several challengers and the formidable shadow of Jesse Jackson.
   Word of the postponement of Barry's announcement, which had been
scheduled for Sunday, came from top city officials, who spoke only
on condition they not be identified.
   Jackson was in Chicago. His only comment on the arrest was to
say he was ``stunned.'' The two-time presidential candidate
established residence in the nation's capital last year and has
held a wide lead in opinion polls over all other potential mayoral
candidates.
   But Jackson had said he would not challenge Barry, an old friend
from thir days in the civil rights movement. In recent weeks,
sources close to Jackson had described him as backing away from a
mayoral bid.
   Barry, 53, was arrested on a narcotics charge Thursday night in
what federal authorities described as ``an ongoing public
corruption probe.'' He was charged with one count of cocaine
possession, a misdemeanor.
   A federal law enforcement source said authorities had a
videotape of Barry smoking crack cocaine at a downtown hotel. Barry
has long denied rumors that he uses drugs.
   ``Politically, I think he is finished,'' said Julius Hobson,
formerly the city's chief lobbyist on Capitol Hill and now an aide
to Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va. ``This charge, apparently with audio
and video evidence ... (is) political evidence that you cannot
overcome.''
   Hobson added, ``This may well be the opening that many of us
have speculated Jesse was looking for. He has said he would never
run against Marion, and now that problem may have been solved for
him.''
   Walter Fauntroy, Washington's elected non-voting member of
Congress, said he was in shock _ ``the shock that comes to any
family member who has been told repeatedly by somebody he cares
about that he is not using drugs, and finds out that's not the
case.''
   Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va., ranking Republican on the House
Committee on the District of Columbia, said Barry should
temporarily turn over his mayoral duties to another city official
while the case is pending.
   Ron Brown, the national chairman of the Democratic Party, called
the arrest ``troubling news.'' Brown said in a statement issued by
his office that Barry ``is entitled to his day in court and I
believe that a discussion of the political options for the District
of Columbia should not interfere with the legal process.''
   Brown's counterpart, Republican Chairman Lee Atwater, declined
comment when asked about Barry's arrest, as did William Bennett,
President Bush's federal drug policy coordinator.
   Even before Thursday night's arrest, Barry's chances of winning
re-election appeared shaky as the drug use accusations mounted, the
city's homicide rate continued breaking records and Barry battled
claims of fiscal mismanagement. In 1986, he faced only token
Democratic opposition in his re-election bid; this time around,
four Democrats so far said they would run against him.
   Barry, elected in 1978 as the city's second mayor under home
rule, said as recently as Friday that he has been the victim of
``character assassination.''
   The arrest ``certainly is going to put a damper on his campaign,
if indeed there is a campaign,'' said attorney Max Berry, who
directed Barry's 1986 re-election effort but has since soured on
the mayor. ``If there is any good to come from this, maybe we will
look inside ourselves, find better candidates for office and demand
more of them.''
   Gregory E. Mize, general counsel to the D.C. Council, said that
by law, the mayor can keep his office even though he has been
arrested. However, Mize said that if Barry were convicted and
incarcerated, he probably would not still qualify as a voter and
therefore could lose his office.
   Elected officials said they were stunned by the news of Barry's
arrest, and many predicted he now will have a difficult time
gaining support for a fourth term.
   ``I just think this is going to be a terrible shock to the young
people of our city,'' said City Councilman John Ray, one of those
challenging Barry for the Democratic mayoral nomination.
   Others spoke of the irony of the city's top elected official
facing drug charges as drug-related murders continued to plague the
city.
   ``Obviously, anybody who has to depend on public support in a
time where there is drug pushing and a lot of killing will be
negatively affected politically,'' said Councilman Frank Smith.
``This is a difficult thing to deal with.''
   But nearly all observers said the mayor's arrest is the latest
indignity for a city burdened over the past two years with an
increasingly negative image around the country.
   ``As a native Washingtonian, it's embarrassing,'' Hobson said.
``It is also a truly sad time for ... local Washington.''

<TEXT>
   A ski and sled dog team trying to make
the first unmechanized crossing of Antarctica has arrived at the
Soviet scientific base of Vostok, the last major stop before the
journey's final leg.
   Thursday's arrival of the Trans-Antarctica Expedition, led by
Will Steger of Ely and Jean-Louis Etienne of France, was confirmed
when Etienne called a Paris science museum via satellite telephone,
according to a statement from the expedition's headquarters in St.
Paul.
   The six-person team's 750-mile trek from the South Pole to
Vostok was the first foot crossing of the inhospitable Area of
Inaccessibility.
   They planned to rest several days at the base in eastern
Antarctica before heading the difficult final 850 miles of its
4,000-mile journey to Mirnyy, which they hope to reach in early
March.
   After leaving Vostok, which is at 11,500 feet, the team will
encounter deep snow and many crevasses as they travel to Mirnyy, a
Soviet science station on the continent's Indian Ocean shore.
   As the Antarctic winter approaches, the team expects
temperatures to drop daily from the current 30 degrees below to as
low as 80 below.
   ``Our team can handle the weather,'' Steger said in a recorded
message sent to the expedition's headquarters. ``It is the lack of
visibility that will be a major problem. If we can't see the trail
we will have to sit in our tents and wait. We cannot travel when we
cannot see because the terrain will be full of crevasses.''
   The team includes members from Great Britain, Japan, the Soviet
Union and China.

administrators have covered three nude drawings hung in a hallway
school art gallery until after spring registration, drawing

   Donna Moore, 38, an art instructor at Truckee Meadows and at the

decision to cover her charcoal artwork.
   The female nudes are an artistic tradition and ``the perfect
creation of God,'' she said.
   But student Loretta Abbott, 24, disagreed.
   ``I try to follow Jesus Christ,'' she said. ``I sin enough on my
own. I don't need to pass by this every day.''
   The decision to cover the nudes was made because of Abbott's
complaints and because children often accompany parents to the
college during registration, which ends Wednesday, said Jim
Claybrook, a college grants administrator.

<TEXT>
   New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art
will help one of Europe's least-known art museums, the Romanian
National, restore a collection damaged by revolution and four
decades of Communist rule.
   Philippe de Montebello, director of the Metropolitan Museum of
Art, met with senior cultural officials Thursday to assess the
damage, and he said afterward he will try to raise corporate
support to give the Romanians basic materials and equipment.
   One way to help may be to exhibit at the Met six to eight of the
best works from the Romanian collection, which features El Grecos,
Van Eycks and French impressionists, de Montebello said.
   The Romanian collection and its museum were severely damaged in
the revolution that toppled dictator Nicolae Ceausescu on Dec. 22.
It also had suffered for years beforehand from lack of funds and
political manipulation, the Romanian and American museum officials
say.
   ``The problems are much greater than the damage caused by the
revolution,'' said Everett Fahy, the Met's chief curator who
accompanied de Montebello. ``Due to decades of neglect ... their
heritage is disintegrating.''
   Dorana Cosoveanu, an art critic who has spent 25 years at the
Romanian National Gallery, confirmed that as she guided a visitor
around the burned-out, bullet- and mortar-scarred galleries of what
used to be an art museum.
   In 1977, Ceausescu appointed Alexander Cebuc, a historian
specializing in Communist Party lore, to head the art gallery, she
said.
   Part of the Ceausescu personality cult were the exhibits the
dictator and his wife, Elena, constantly imposed on the museum,
forcing it to turn over its ground floor galleries to giant
paintings glorifying the ruling couple, she said.
   Now, as workers begin the enormous task of repairing the gallery
and dozens of canvases ripped by bullets, there is just one
painting _ a torn portrait of the Ceausescus _ left hanging.
   Part of a vast canvas showing the rulers surrounded by Romanian
children in folk costume, it has been vandalized by the workers to
depict Ceausescu as a latter-day Adolf Hitler complete with Nazi
swastika medal and ``SS'' on his lapels, and shows his wife as a
she-devil with giant red ears.
   The gallery's real exhibits are in storage, some of them
bandaged as primitively as injured victims of the revolution in the
museum workers' attempts to carry out what Cosoveanu termed ``first
aid'' on the damaged paintings.
   De Montebello said the museum needs everything from rice paper
and canvas, to photocopying machines. He also said its workers need
to gain modern expertise by interning at the Met.
   What some of the museum's employees lacked in that knowledge
they made up in devotion as the gallery came under heavy fire in
the battle against Ceausescu.
   The gallery was heavily attacked because it was housed in one
wing of Ceausescu's official presidential palace, the former palace
of Romania's kings, in central Bucharest.
   An attic common to the presidential quarters and the gallery
apparently enabled the ``terrorists'' _ as Romanians call the
Ceausescu loyalists _ to sneak down a now-blackened staircase in
the museum to battle the army outside.
   Not one museum window survived the onslaught of gunfire and
mortars in the battle between soldiers loyal to the revolt and
elite Ceausescu guards opposing it.
   Cosoveanu first realized the museum's collection could be in
danger hours before the dictator's overthrow, when angry crowds
swarmed into the Palace square early on Dec. 22.
   She feared they did not know that one wing of the palace was an
art collection. Leaping from the ground floor window of a now
burned-out office, she ran to the crowds to urge them against
attack, assuring them this was a museum, not a Ceausescu haunt.
   Museum workers, meanwhile, scrambled to remove to storage the
paintings and artifacts small enough for them to carry, she said.
   Young people, and even Cebuc and other party officials, helped
as fierce fighting erupted toward evening, trapping her and other
loyal workers in the museum.
   Eventually, soldiers arrived. They were too late to save 16
destroyed canvases or to prevent severe damage to at least 20
others.
   Under the guidance of Cosoveanu and other museum officials who
braved heavy gunfire to return to the gallery, however, they moved
a giant El Greco ``Adoration'' and several other valuable works to
safety.
   A tour of the museum made evident it will take years to repair
the damage done to Romania's finest art collection, but the
revolution has restored to the museum some hope it can once again
become a national pride.
   ``We'll have the whole building,'' Cosoveanu said. ``When I was
a student, the museum was in all the palace. So we'll go back to
older times in this respect _ I hope.''

   Imprisoned soul singer James Brown was
eligible for a work release program Friday, but he stayed in jail
because South Carolina authorities aren't sure about his Georgia
sentence.
   Brown, 56, was jailed a year ago for aggravated assault and
failing to stop for police. He already was on probation for a
guilty plea involving carrying an unlawful pistol, resisting arrest
and pleading no contest for possession of the hallucinogenic drug
phencyclidine, or PCP.
   He was sentenced in South Carolina to six years six months, and
in Georgia to six years and three months, with the two sentences
running concurrently.
   ``When it comes to work release, our laws are different, and we
have asked his attorney to get his Georgia status clear. We haven't
heard back,'' Department of Corrections spokesman Francis X.
Archibald said Thursday.

   The Foreign Ministry said the evacuation was requested by
Ambassador Fouad Turk, who spent the last week negotiating with the
occupants to leave.
   Dozens of protesters took over the chancellory Jan. 11 to
protest the plans of Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss to transfer
several diplomats in the United States and Europe.
   They controlled the embassy switchboard and prevented staff from
entering.
   Several hundred demonstrators turned out to support them Sunday,
walking through the chancellory and chanting pro-Aoun slogans.
   Aoun, a Maronite Christian who controls remnants of Lebanon's
army, is opposed to Hoss and President Elias Hrawi, whom he views
as appointees of Syria. Syria maintains about 40,000 troops in the
Middle Eastern country and supports Moslem militias opposed to Aoun.

   An army colonel, three
lieutenants and five enlisted men were charged with murder today in
the November slayings of six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and
her teen-age daughter.
   Judge Ricardo Zamora of the 4th Penal Court ordered the eight
defendants in custody held for trial on charges of murder with
``premeditation and perfidy,'' which carries a maximum sentence of
30 years, according to court secretary Nicolas Hernandez.
   The ninth suspect deserted from the army in December and is a
fugitive.
   Zamora issued his ruling at the end of a 72-hour deadline that
began Tuesday when the prisoners, who have been under arrest since
early January, were put at the disposition of the court.
   The ruling means there is enough evidence to make a case against
the defendants. The ruling begins a 120-day period during which the
case is prepared for trial, but this investigation phase can be
delayed by motions.
   Col. Guillermo Benavides, director of the Military College, is
the highest ranking armed forces officer to be accused of a crime
involving a human rights abuse in the 10-year-old civil war against
leftist guerrillas.
   The slain Jesuits were educators at the Jose Simeon Canas
Central American University, one of the region's top colleges.
   The killings shocked El Salvador and the world and prompted
calls in the Congress for reappraisal of the $1.5 million daily
that Washington supplies in U.S. economic and military aid to this
small Central American nation.
   No military officer has been convicted before of a crime linked
to human rights abuses, even though rightist death squads sponsored
or tolerated by the armed forces killed thousands of suspected
leftists in the early 1980s.
   The Jesuits and the two women were slain in their campus home
Nov. 16, five days after the Farabundo Marti National Liberation
Front guerrillas launched their biggest offensive of the war.
   The far right had long accused the Jesuits of being subversive
ideologues because of they publicly argued that the civil war was
the result of gross social injustice rather than a communist
attempt to seize power.

   The school board has insulted blacks by
giving students a day off on Confederate Heroes Day but not on
Martin Luther King Jr. Day, a local NAACP official said.
   ``Houston, Dallas, San Antonio and Fort Worth schools closed to
recognize Martin Luther King Jr. Day,'' Victor Goode said Thursday
at a news conference in front of a statue honoring Texans who
fought for the Confederacy during the Civil War.
   ``Why Austin refuses and, whether wittingly or unwittingly,
encourages the celebration of Confederate Heroes Day is
insulting,'' said Goode, a member of the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People.
   Confederate Heroes Day, celebrated today, honors Robert E. Lee,
the general who led Confederate forces, and Jefferson Davis, the
president of the Confederacy.
   Monday's federal holiday honoring the slain civil rights leader
and the holiday honoring the Confederate leaders are optional state
holidays. But there is a difference. Workers taking off the King
holiday must make up that time by working one of several state
holidays. But state employees taking off Confederate Heroes Day do
not have to make up the time and those that do work get
compensatory time off.
   Austin Independent School District officials said they gave
students Thursday and today off because it's the end of the
semester. Teachers use the time to compile grades and prepare for
the spring semester.
   School trustee Bernice Hart, the only black on the seven-member
board, said the two days off at the end of the semester are given
to students each year.
   ``I had no idea it was Confederate Heroes Day,'' Ms. Hart said.
``It's simply on the calendar as the end of the semester.''

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soft and alluringly sexy are the way couturiers see
women and their clothes for next summer in early sneak previews of
haute couture shows.
   Designers are frantically stitching up hems _ very short _ for
the shows that get under way this weekend. Luxury clothes are more
feminine than ever: softer shoulders, deeper decolletes, flounces
and embroideries.
   The shows will be more Italian than ever, with Gianfranco Ferre
now haute couturier for Dior, and Angelo Tarlazzi designing for Guy
Laroche's couture house, following Laroche's death last winter.
   Gianni Versace also is giving a show of his ``Atelier'' styles
and a gala dinner at the Hotel Ritz on Saturday night.
   ``Paris is the best showcase,'' said Versace, who displayed his
furred and fussy clothes on mannequins at a museum last season but
considers this show with live models his real Paris couture debut.
   But Italians won't be grabbing all the headlines.
   Fashion-watchers are looking forward to the Lanvin show with
French designer Claude Montana at the design helm. Will the
avant-garde creator produce the kind of opulent elegance usually
seen at this venerable house? They'll find out on Tuesday with the
Lanvin show near the Ecole Militaire.
   As the first French couturier to breech the Iron Curtain, Pierre
Cardin has manufactured and sold clothes in the Soviet Union for
several years. He was instrumental in helping set up a French model
agency, ``Glamour,'' there last fall, and he encouraged the Soviet
government to accord professional status to models.
   Besides higher hemlines, the upcoming 25 couture shows include
billowy organzas by Ferre for Dior, and sexy, draped and structured
shapes in silk at Givenchy.
   Hanae Mori, celebrating her 35th year in fashion, is kicking up
her heels with some shorter, knee-revealing styles, which is new
for this usually conservative Japanese designer.
   Louis Feraud plans to show off garden-party girls in fluid
dresses with appliqued leaves, but also revealed a bit of bare
midriff in a little silk suit with graphic striped bows in a
preview photo session.
   Jean-Louis Scherrer is apprently still inspired by his all-time
favorite theme of the rich Raj looks from India: turbans, silk
braid and all.
   Colors will be hot and spicy, starting with a shocking pink suit
by Erik Mortensen at Balmain. Karl Lagerfeld is going for some warm
corals in his collection of abbreviated styles for Chanel.
   Ungaro previewed an intriguing silk suit of pink and lavender
piped in fanciful swirls of tangerine around the asymmetric
decollete jacket.
   Philippe Venet uses mandarin orange and plum to advantage in a
short raw silk suit with trapeze jacket.
   After his Sunday couture show, Christian Lacroix's big moment
will be the Sunday night launch of his first perfume with a musical
show at the Opera Comique. Named ``C'est la Vie,'' the scent will
be presented in an elaborate bottle sculpted with a handprint and a
little coral branch _ a Lacroix signature.

<HEAD>Alabama Can Fly Confederate Flag, Court Says</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS one graf at end with judges' names.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court conceded that
the Confederate battle flag that flies atop the Alabama Capitol is
offensive to many people, but declined to get involved in the
dispute.
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in a ruling made public
Thursday, said the flying of the Rebel banner on public buildings
does not violate the Constitution, as alleged by the NAACP and 14
black state lawmakers.
   The Atlanta-based appeals court upheld a district court decision
in favor of the state, rejecting claims that the flag display
violates the First, 13th and 14th amendments.
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,
along with the 14 legislators, sued the state to remove the
Confederate flag, which flies on top of the Capitol dome with the
American and state flags.
   One of the legislators, Rep. Alvin Holmes, said no decision had
been made on an appeal, but he hopes the case is taken to the U.S.
Supreme Court.
   ``The issue of the Confederate flag is not going to go away. We
are going to continue our efforts to remove it because it
represents slavery and oppression toward black people. It's hurting
the image of the state and hurting industry coming into the
state,'' Holmes said.
   The appeals court suggested that those who oppose the display go
through the Legislature to get it taken down.
   ``It is unfortunate that the state of Alabama chooses to utilize
its property in a manner that offends a large portion of its
population, but that is a political matter,'' the court said.
   The NAACP said the flying of the flag amounted to use of state
property for racially discriminatory purposes; violatated the 13th
Amendment ban on slavery as it was viewed by many blacks as a
symbol of slavery; and violated free speech because salutation of
the American flag was inhibited by those who oppose the Confederate
flag.
   The 11th Circuit rejected all three arguments.
   The 3-0 decision came from a panel composed of U.S. Circuit
Judges Frank Johnson Jr. and Larry Edmondson, and Robert F.
Peckham, a senior U.S. district judge from California. Johnson
wrote the court's opinion.

<HEAD>Government Sets Dates of Ceremonies to Enthrone Emperor Akihito</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Japan-Mayor, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Emperor Akihito will be formally enthroned in
November in two ceremonies costing $55.6 million, a government
committee decided Friday.
   The decision was made official during a Cabinet meeting after
the committee, chaired by Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, discussed
and approved the ceremony dates, an official at the Prime
Minister's Office said.
   The coronation will be held as a state affair at the Imperial
Palace in Tokyo on Nov. 12, while the ``Daijosai,'' or ``Great Food
Offering Ritual,'' will be conducted according to customs of the
Shinto religion on the evening of Nov. 22 and will last into the
following day.
   Akihito, 56, assumed the Chrysanthemum Throne when his father,
Hirohito, died of cancer at age 87 on Jan. 7, 1989. But he and
other imperial family members avoided holding important ceremonies
and observed a year-long mourning period, thus delaying the
coronation.
   The government has earmarked $55.6 million as expenses for the
two ceremonies in next fiscal year's budget, which starts April 1.
   In the coronation, Akihito will announce his accession to about
2,500 invited dignitaries at the palace.
   Akihito and Empress Michiko will then lead a parade through
Tokyo to announce the coronation and receive blessings from the
people. Four days of banquets are to be held from that evening,
with a total guest list of 3,400.
   In the controversial Daijosai, the new emperor offers freshly
harvested rice to the gods of Shinto, then joins the gods in a
communion and sleeps with the spirit of the sun goddess, according
to the Shinto religion. Shinto is an indigenous faith based on
nature worship, shamanism and elaborate rites.
   The Cabinet has said the Daijosai is ``a public ceremony in
nature,'' but that it will not conduct the rite as a state affair
because that might violate the constitutional separation of state
and religion.
   Some opposition parties, including the Socialists and
Communists, have denounced state funding.
   Under the Constitution, the emperor is a symbolic figurehead.

<HEAD>High Stakes in Play in Britain's Ambulance Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The army ambulances screaming through London
traffic look like a throwback to World War II, but they symbolize a
modern-day battle between Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and the
nation's ambulance drivers.
   Army and police ambulances have been thrown into the fray while
the government and the drivers vie for public opinion in a pay
dispute that is nearly 5 months old and ranks among the classic
confrontations with organized labor that have marked Mrs.
Thatcher's decade in power.
   Routine services have ceased almost throughout the country,
forcing state health authorities to hire taxis and relatives to use
their own cars to bring non-emergency cases to hospitals.
   Emergency calls are diverted to the police, army or Red Cross.
Meanwhile, some crews suspended for joining the dispute are
operating an unofficial service. They accept emergency calls direct
from hospitals or members of the public, but not from the ambulance
control rooms, which are their management.
   Each side accuses the other of being callous and risking lives
in the increasingly bizarre and acrimonious dispute. There are no
official figures on strike-related deaths, but doctors in
Birmingham, central England, say they know of three patients who
died because help arrived too late.
   The protests began Sept. 7 when Britain's 22,500 ambulance
drivers started refusing to work overtime.
   In October, emergency crews stopped using their radios or, in
many cases, answering calls routed through control rooms.
   Their employer, the state-funded National Health Service,
responded by suspending the drivers without pay.
   With the crisis deepening, the Conservative Party government
ordered in police and army ambulances on Nov. 8. It was the first
time they had been used for civilian ambulance work since 1978-79,
when public service strikes hit a Labor Party government.
   As frustration mounts, crews at half a dozen stations in London
and south England recently defied union orders and voted to strike.
Union leaders fear this will alienate the public.
   The public, which in the past has backed Mrs. Thatcher against
the once-powerful unions, has so far supported the ambulance crews.
They have become national heroes during an 18-month string of
national disasters, including the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103.
   The latest Gallup opinion poll says they are backed by 85
percent of Britons.
   Four million people signed a petition of support, and 30,000
turned out to cheer the crews as they marched through central
London.
   Health Secretary Kenneth Clarke, the government's front-line
fighter in the dispute, rejects the crews' claim to be treated like
police and firefighters, arguing that only 10 percent of ambulance
work involves real emergencies.
   But he has blundered in his choice of words _ saying most
ambulance crews run a ``taxi service for old ladies,'' and that
they are little more than ``professional drivers, a worthwhile job
but not an exceptional one.''
   Such imagery goes down poorly with a public that is used to
seeing ambulance crews cutting survivors out of train wrecks or
wading into burning subway stations.
   ``We are sick to death of this government ... attending every
disaster that occurs, saying how wonderful the emergency services
are and then refusing to pay them a decent wage,'' says Labor
lawmaker Dawn Primarolo.
   Ambulance crews, who earn $16,630 a year, want 11.4 percent
more, plus the automatic inflation-linked raises given to
firefighters and policemen.
   The government has offered 6.5 percent, and bonuses for staff
who have paramedical skills. The drivers reject that as ``elitist
and divisive.''
   The confrontation encapsulates the problems Mrs. Thatcher faces
amid signs that Britain is slipping back into old habits of pricing
itself out of the market with inflation-fueling wage hikes.
   Latest figures show production costs in Britain rising three
times faster than in the United States and more than six times
faster than in Japan.
   The ambulance crews' demands could be met for a paltry $16
million. But inflation is near 8 percent, and the government fears
a surrender would encourage demands for double-digit raises by the
rest of the one million staff in the health service, Europe's
biggest employer.
   ``To the government it doesn't matter who dies, they are just
hellbent on defeating us,'' said Chris Cosham, a 28-year-old
suspended ambulanceman. ``It looks very desperate for us now. But
we'll give them a bloody fight.''

<HEAD>Auditor Cites Weak Financial Controls on Drought-relief Haylifts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A drought-relief program for farmers in
1988 and 1989 suffered from poor financial controls that resulted
in large uncollectable debts and sometimes involved poor-quality
hay, according to an audit.
   ``Because controls over the program were weak, the (Minnesota
Agriculture Department) and the state have lost money on the
program,'' according to a legislative auditor's report released
Thursday.
   The haylifts were implemented in an effort to get low-cost hay
to drought-stricken farmers. The state bought the hay at
below-market prices and sold it to farmers for the same price.
   The state bought $258,000 worth of drought-relief hay in 1988
and by late last year had collected only $129,325 from farmers, the
audit says. The Agriculture Department said the 1988 haylift
delivered hay to 432 farmers, 407 of whom paid for it. In the 1989
haylift, the state bought $176,000 worth of hay, delivered to 114
farmers, and had collected $81,600 from only 78 farmers by late
last year.
   The auditor reported that some of the hay was so waterlogged or
spoiled that it had to be buried. In addition, the audit said the
state hadn't tried to collect on about $30,000 worth of spoiled hay
from the 1988 haylift.
   On one occasion, the audit reported, the state paid people who
had volunteered to work on the haylift program for nothing.

<TEXT>
   A state appellate court today overturned the
murder convictions of three former executives in the work-related
death of an employee exposed to cyanide on the job.
   The 1985 Cook County Circuit Court verdict against executives of
Elk Grove Village-based Film Recovery Systems Inc. was believed to
be the first in which corporate officials were convicted of murder
charges in a job-related death.
   The appellate court ruled the convictions on charges of murder
and on charges of involuntary manslaughter and reckless conduct
were ``irreconcileable'' because of the different mental states
required for such findings, said defense attorney Elliot Samuels.
   ``The court has opened the door for a new prosecution,'' Samuels
said.
   Stefan Golab, 61, a Polish immigrant who worked at the plant
where cyanide was used to recover silver from used X-ray film,
collapsed at work after complaining of dizziness and nausea in
1983. His death was attributed to cyanide poisoning from inhaling
fumes on the job.
   The appellate court sent the case back to the lower court, where
Cook County State's Attorney Cecil Partee may pursue it if he
decides to, said spokesman Ed McManus. Partee was out of the office
and not immediately available for comment, McManus said.
   The state's attorney's office under the direction of Richard M.
Daley, now mayor of Chicago, successfully prosecuted the case in
1985.
   The appeals court overturned convictions on charges of murder,
reckless conduct and involuntary manlaughter against the defunct
company's former president, Steven J. O'Neil, plant manager Charles
Kirschbaum and foreman Daniel Rodriquez.
   The men were found guilty at a bench trial before Circuit Judge
Ronald J.P. Banks.
   Elliot, who represent Kirschbaum and Rodriquez in the appeal,
said that a murder conviction required a determination of a
deliberate state of mind, while a finding of reckless conduct
required a finding ``somewhere between negligence and indifference
... conscious disregard of serious risk.''
   ``We argued that (contradiction) at the trial level and at the
appeal,'' he said.
   Five people originally were charged. Gerald Pett, a vice
president and manager was acquitted.
   A fifth defendant, Utah businessman and former Film Recovery
vice president Michael McKay, has been the subject of three
unsuccessful extradition requests by Illinois Gov. James R.
Thompson. Utah officials said they questioned whether he could
receive a fair trial.

   Texas gubernatorial candidate Clayton
Williams is defending two fist fights during his adult life,
asking, ``Do you want a patsy for governor or somebody who'll fight
for the things Texas needs?''
   Some of his election opponents have criticized the fights, but
the oilman, rancher and Republican front-runner says in each case
it was the proper thing to do.
   ``I have had two fights in 33 years,'' Williams, 58, said
Thursday. ``That's not too bad. I will defend myself.''
   The fights occurred in Williams' hometown of Midland, Texas,
about five years ago.
   Williams, shown leading the seven-candidate Republican primary
field in recent opinion polls, was criticized this week by
opponents Kent Hance and Tom Luce.
   ``This is not like the old days in Texas where you take the law
into your own hands,'' said Luce's campaign manager, Jim Oberwetter.
   ``It's going to be up to the voters to decide if Clayton
Williams' propensity for fighting is going to be an issue,'' said
Hance press secretary Mark Sanders.
   But Williams and his staff defended both encounters.
   Bill Kenyon, the candidate's press secretary, said the fights
involved people who once were friends of Williams. ``One who had
severely betrayed his trust and the other who was just an outright
bully, a physical bully, to Clayton's employees,'' he said.
   Williams said he had no regrets.
   ``The one fight in question, a guy became an alcholic. He was a
close friend of mine and I was not dealing with him but with the
disease of alcoholism,'' Williams said. He said the man had
``harassed all my little people'' for several years after Williams
fired him in 1978.
   ``He came in the building one day raising Cain. It was my idea
that this was man-to-man. It wasn't time to call a policeman or a
lawyer. It was he and I, and I decked him. And I'd do it again.''
   Williams also defended the outcome.
   ``Are we interested in results? The man never, ever bothered any
of my people again.''
   As the issue has gained publicity around the state, Williams and
his staff appear to be enjoying the attention.
   ``I don't now how Tom Luce would handle a bully, but I think
most Texans would appreciate a man who would stand up to a bully
... What's he going to do, call a lawyer?'' responded Kenyon when
told of Luce's criticism.

   A limousine carrying President Bush broke down
today, briefly delaying Bush as he was being ferried to downtown
Atlanta to make a speech, the Secret Service said.
   Bush's car developed an oil pressure problem, causing it to stop
on Interstate 75 in northwest Atlanta, Dwight Ellison, agent in
charge of the Secret Service office in Atlanta, said.
   ``We switched him to a spare limo,'' Ellison said.
   After the brief stop, the Bush motorcade continued to the Omni
arena, where the president spoke to the National Homebuilders
Association.
   The disabled limousine was left at the side of the road with a
police guard, police spokesman Michael Powell said.
   Bush later went by motorcade to Dobbins Air Force Base, where he
boarded Air Force One for a visit to Florida.

   Roughly half of the 3.5 million low-income
older Americans covered by Medicaid needlessly spend hundreds of
dollars for private medical insurance, according to a private study
released Friday.
   Between 1.5 million and 2 million people 65 and older are
projected to have private insurance such as ``medigap'' policies
even though Medicaid covers their medical expenses, the report said.
   The study was commissioned and released by the American
Association of Retired Persons and prepared by Market Facts Inc.
based on interviews with a random sample of 1,500 older people
contacted by telephone in January and February 1989.
   ``These findings clearly demonstrate that much more needs to be
done to prevent the sale of medigap policies to the
Medicaid-eligible population,'' said AAR Executive Director Horace
Deets.
   Medigap policies are designed to cover certain hospital and
other medical costs not covered by Medicare. Other health insurance
policies bought by older Americans include hospital indemnity plans
and policies covering specific diseases.
   The survey found more than 3 million older Americans who do not
qualify for Medicaid say they cannot afford to supplement their
Medicare coverage by buying medigap or other private health
policies.
   That number is expected to grow as medigap premiums rise, pushed
up in part by the repeal of Medicare's coverage of catastrophic
health care expenses, AARP said.
   The government's General Accounting Office surveyed 20 major
medigap insurers late last year and found that 1990 premiums were
expected to rise by an average of 19.5 percent over 1989 levels,
with increases ranging from 5 percent to 52 percent. The companies
attributed more than half of the price rise to increased benefits
and administrative costs created by the repeal of the catastrophic
package.
   The AARP study found that people paid an average of $705 a year
in premiums for their medigap policies.
   ``Now that many benefits provided under the catastrophic act
have been removed, medigap insurance is all the more necessary,''
Deets said. ``The real tragedy is that due to its increasing costs,
this coverage may be out of reach for more older persons.''

   Japanese expressed outrage Friday over
the attempted assassination of Nagasaki's mayor by an
ultranationalist who said he ``couldn't condone'' the mayor's
comments about the late Emperor Hirohito.
   About 300 city employees rallied outside City Hall, one day
after Hitoshi Motoshima was shot there by a right-wing extremist.
   Motoshima had received death threats since he said in December
1988 that he felt Hirohito, at the time dying of cancer, bore some
responsibility for World War II.
   ``The mayor was shot, but he was not the only target. Democracy
is being threatened,'' said Yukiyoshi Sato, secretary-general of
the Nagasaki City Hall Workers Union.
   ``They've caught the assailant, but that's just the tip of the
rightists. They'll just keep coming back,'' Sato said as he sat at
the wheel of a van carrying a large banner reading, ``Bullets
cannot kill democracy.''
   Police arrested Kazumi Tajiri, an avoved right-wing terrorist
from Tokyo, and searched offices of The Sane Thinkers School, the
rightist group to which he belonged, a police official said on
condition of anonymity.
   Tajiri, 40, admitted shooting Motoshima and said he ``couldn't
condone'' Motoshima's remarks, police told reporters. The
67-year-old mayor also said at the time that Hirohito could have
prevented the atomic bombing of Nagasaki on Aug. 9, 1945, and of
Hiroshima three days earlier. The nuclear attack on Nagasaki left
at least 70,000 people dead.
   The comments infuriated Japan's small but radical right-wing
fringe, who revere the imperial family and descended on City Hall
in sound trucks demanding ``Death to Motoshima.'' Police protection
was provided until Motoshima asked that it be discontinued last
month.
   Following the shooting, the National Police Agency urged local
authorities to increase their vigilance over the nation's 820
right-wing groups and recommended tighter security for public
figures.
   At the City Hall rally, Sato said the mayor ``risked his own
life in fighting to protect freedom of speech and democracy. We
declare our resolve to resolutely uphold these principles in the
wake of this attempt to suppress them with a pistol.''
   Motoshima was shot once in the back, with the bullet slightly
damaging his left lung. Doctors said he would recover and could
leave the hospital in a month.
   Government officials were quick to condemn the attack.
   ``It cannot be tolerated in the context of freedom and
democracy,'' said Chief Cabinet Secretary Mayumi Moriyama, the top
government spokeswoman.
   In an editorial, the daily Asahi Shimbun said such violence
``will lead to fascism.''
   ``It's a real shock. In Japan it's so rare for anyone to have a
gun _ just police and gangsters,'' said Mikako Umehara, a City Hall
employee. ``For this to happen right in front of our eyes is, I
think, a much bigger shock than for Americans or Europeans.''
   Possession of handguns is illegal in Japan, and only police, the
military and strictly licensed hunters are allowed firearms.
   The Nagasaki City Council on Friday condemned the attack, which
it called ``not only a challenge to freedom of speech but a threat
to the very existence of a democratic society.''
   Hirohito died Jan. 7, 1988 at the age of 87, and formal
enthronement ceremonies will take place Nov. 12 for Emperor
Akihito, his son.
   Hirohito renounced his divinity after the war. Many historians
agree he was a figurehead wartime leader, but some critics say he
played a more active role.
   Motoshima received several visitors Friday, said city spokesman
Masayuki Chita. Several police guarded the hospital.
   Chita said get-well wishes came from more than 500 people,
including some in Nagasaki's sister cities, St. Paul, Minn., and
Fuzhou, China.

   Nearly all major figures in Nicolae
Ceausescu's government, including all but one of the 19 surviving
members of his Politburo, are in custody and will face trial, the
prosecutor-general said Friday.
   Also on Friday, state media reported that the leader of the
Romanian Orthodox Church stepped down after criticism that he was
an apologist for the ousted Communist dictator.
   About 200 students walked out of classes at Bucharest
University's college of architecture, demanding that 26 of the
school's 82 professors be fired as incompetents who gained their
positions though political connections during Ceausescu's brutal
24-year rule.
   Prosecuting Ceausescu loyalists is a key test of the National
Salvation Front, the provisional government that is struggling to
gain the support of the people and lead the country to free
elections later this year.
   Prosecutor-General Gheorghe Robu said in an interview in the
newspaper Adevarul that 18 members of the former 21-member
Politburo were in custody. Two others, Ceausescu and his wife,
Elena, were convicted of ``grave crimes'' and executed Dec. 25,
three days after they were ousted in a popular uprising.
   The only Politburo member not under arrest was Paul Niculescu, a
more liberal official who is said to have offered his services to
the new government.
   Robu said that 31 former high-ranking officials have been
arrested in all, including one of Ceausescu's sons, Nicu, the
former party chief in the western city of Sibiu. Robu said most of
the jailed Ceausescu figures were cooperating with investigators.
   Those expected to be tried first are former Communist Party
Secretary Emil Bobu, No. 3 in the government behind the Ceausescus
and former Interior Minister Tudor Postelnicu, who headed the
despised Securitate secret police. Also among those to be tried are
Politburo members Manea Manescu and Ion Dinca.
   Their trials were expected to begin next week before a military
tribunal.
   Robu said one of Ceausescu's daughters, Zoia-Elena, and another
son, Valentin, were in jail but were not leading figures in the
ousted regime.
   The prosecutor said Zoia-Elena had gone on a brief hunger strike
in her first days in jail, refusing anything but coffee and smoking
her own supply of American cigarettes.
   ``We told to her that she's living in exactly the same
conditions that the Romanian people were subjected to, and she's
adopted reasonable behavior,'' the newspaper quoted Robu as saying.
   Defense Minister Nicolae Militaru wrote in the newspaper that
the flow of electricity might be cut to some large industries,
saying the country's energy supply was endangered by factories
routinely using more than their allotted share.
   ``Enterprises that draw too much power and do not obey the
regulations will have their electricity shut down,'' he said.
   On Tuesday, Romania's generating plants had to produce 300 extra
megawatts of power to meet demand, he said.
   Under Ceausescu's rule, heating and electricity were strictly
limited in public buildings and hundreds of thousands of
state-owned apartments to conserve energy so that Romania could
export oil.
   One of the first steps taken by new government was to increase
heating and release to the public food in state warehouses.
   Since then, emergency supplies of both food and fuel have had to
be imported.
   Romanian media said the patriarch of the Orthodox church,
Teoctist Arapasu, officially resigned Thursday for reasons of age
and health. His age was not given.
   There had been a clamor for his dismissal since the revolution.
   Under Ceausescu, the church advised its flock to be loyal to the
regime despite repeated government interference in church matters,
such as the the jailing of priests that displeased the regime and
banning of some services.
   The denomination is the nation's larges, claiming a membership
of 16 million out of Romania's population of 23 million.
   About 200 of the 500 students in Bucharest's architecture school
went on strike Friday, many pinning small triangular signs on their
shirts that said simply ``greva,'' or ``strike.''
   Student Dumitru Iulian, 21, said he and his colleagues said
students would refuse to attend classes until 26 incompetent
professors were removed.
   ``This is the way the regime worked. These professors scaled the
professional ladder through their politics,'' Iulian said.

   A young doctor suing the hospital where she says
she contracted AIDS was dimissed from the witness stand today
because she was still devastated by her physician's testimony that
she might die within a year.
   ``I'm having trouble talking. I don't think I can go on today. I
apologize,'' Dr. Veronica Prego, told the trial judge, Justice
Aaron D. Bernstein, after five minutes of testimony.
   ``That's OK, don't apologize,'' said Bernstein, who postponed
the proceedings until Monday.
   One of Prego's lawyers, Susan M. Karten, said her client had
complained of a headache and did not sleep Thursday night.
   ``Hearing that she's going to die within a year'' had caused
Prego's restlessness, Karten said. ``She didn't know that. She's
just terribly devastated.''
   Prego, who was among the first health professionals to contract
AIDS at the workplace through a needle stick, cried Thursday when
she first heard her physician estimate how long she could live.
   The blunt assessment came in response to a lawyer's question.
Before asking it, Stanley D. Friedman, the lawyer for the city
Health and Hospitals Corp., offered to allow Prego, 32, to leave
the courtroom. She declined.
   ``It's impossible to predict, but it's possible her life
expectancy will be a year, or perhaps shorter,'' Dr. Gerald H.
Friedland said when Friedman asked how long Prego would live.
   Friedland, Prego's physican for more than three years, said he
had never specifically discussed with Prego how long he believed
she had to live.
   Friedman said the answer was something the jury had to know if
it ruled for Prego and awarded damages for future suffering and
lost earnings.
   Prego's 67-year-old mother, who testified early in the trial and
has sat in the front row of the spectators' section daily, looked
on, but did not understand the prognosis because she speaks only
Spanish.
   Prego moved to the United States in 1982 from Argentina, where
her family still lives.
   She maintains she contracted AIDS on Jan. 12, 1983, while
working at Kings County Hospital, when she accidentally pricked her
finger on a contaminated needle carelessly left amid a pile of
soiled gauze and bed linen by another physician, Dr. Joyce Fogel.
   She is suing the hospital; its parent agency, the Health and
Hospitals Corp.; Fogel and another physican, Sheldon Landesman, for
$175 million, charging negligence.
   The defendants say Prego, who was an unpaid medical-school
graduate in training at the time, was injured through her own
carelessness.
   Landesman, a researcher with the State University of New York
and a physician at Kings County Hospital, conducted a 1984 study
that revealed Prego to be what is believed the first health-care
worker in the country to get AIDS through a needle stick.
   Prego charges Landesman with breaching a pledge of
confidentiality and revealing to other doctors that Prego had been
infected with the fatal disease.Landesman has denied the claim.
   Prego conceded under questioning Thursday that the information
she received from Landesman's study may have helped save her life
in November 1987, when she developed acquired immune deficiency
syndrome and nearly died of pneumonia.
   The Centers for Disease Control has 19 confirmed cases of U.S.
health workers contracting AIDS in the workplace, but officials say
the real figure probably is much higher.

   Frank H. King, whose 38 years with The
Associated Press included a 7,000-mile odyssey across Siberia while
covering the Russian Revolution, died Friday. He was 96.
   King died at an Oakland convalescent and senior home.
   He was the first American reporter to describe, in eyewitness
accounts, life in revolutionary Russia. His exclusive reports were
widely read in America and Europe.
   After his epic journey, King covered Washington, then was
assigned to London for 17 years, where he was chief of bureau. He
was Dallas bureau chief and general executive for the Southwest
before retiring on Dec. 31, 1958.
   King, a native of Excelsior Springs, Mo., and a graduate of the
University of Missouri School of Journalism, was hired as an AP
stringer in Columbia, Mo. He joined the St. Louis Post-Dispatch,
but his $17.50 weekly pay was not enough to hold him when he got a
chance to join the English-language Japan Advertiser in Tokyo.
   With Russia in revolution, the United States, Britain, France
and Japan sent expeditionary forces to Vladivostok in 1918. The AP
and the Japan Advertiser together hired King to cover the turmoil.
   At one point, he was commended by the American command for
helping to rescue women and children besieged by revolutionaries in
the Vladivostok railway station.
   Finally, Admiral Alexander Kolchak, the White Russian leader,
was seized and executed by the Bolsheviks and resistance collapsed.
In the spring of 1920, the Allies pulled out.
   As Japanese soldiers took to shooting at almost anything that
moved, King decided it was healthier to return to Tokyo other than
by the direct route. Instead, he made his way down the coast to
China and Peking.
   The situation changed. King's instinct told him to go west. He
put a small kit together and headed across Mongolia, Siberia and
Russia, where no one in the Western World had any idea what was
going on.
   King was strictly on his own, traveling on anything available.
He walked, rode in a pony cart, a river steamer and on the
Trans-Siberian Railway.
   Always on the move, he went through the Great Wall and across
the Gobi desert. He filed stories, never knowing until long after
whether the copy arrived.
   Moscow authorities finally interned him in an old expropriated
Czarist mansion while they debated what to do with him.
   King was rescued by John Reed, an American radical and darling
of the Leninists. The authorities decided the best solution was to
send King across the border into Finland. From there, he made his
way to London.
   He is survived by his wife, Olga, and son, F.H.H. King, a
college professor in New Mexico. Funeral arrangements were pending.

<HEAD>6-Year-Old with AIDS Writes Book about Disease</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAKEWOOD, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 6-year-old boy who got AIDS from a
blood transfusion when he was a baby has co-written a book about
his fight against the deadly disease and his struggle to lead a
normal life.
   The book, ``My Name is Jonathan (and I have AIDS),'' tells
people in simple terms how to take precautions around AIDS patients
without being fearful of getting the disease.
   ``Children with AIDS need help from other children too,'' writes
Jonathan, who will turn 7 in two months. His last name is not used
to protect his family from harassment. ``Being able to play with my
brother and my friends is important to me. It hurts a lot when
someone won't come to our house because I have AIDS.''
   The other author of the paperback is Sharon Schilling, a health
education teacher and friend of Jonathan's family. It was published
by Denver-based Prickly Pair Publishing and Consulting Co. and is
being sold by mail order and at a Denver bookstore, The Bookies.
   Schilling said she came up with the idea for the book 18 months
ago, hoping to market it to schools and parents. She said she
wanted people to understand the importance of a child infected with
AIDS staying in school.
   Jonathan's medical condition became public more than two years
ago when his mother battled the local school district for the right
to enroll him in public school.
   I told the other kids in my class on my first day about AIDS,''
Jonathan writes in his book.
   ``It's so good to have friends. That's why I wanted to go to
school.''
   Jonathan has been in good health recently and is taking DDI, an
experimental AIDS drug. Although AIDS is fatal, Jonathan already
has lived years longer than doctors predicted.
   ``I got a disease in my blood. I got it from a blood transfusion
when I was a baby. It is called AIDS and it can kill you. If I fall
down and hurt myself so that I bleed, you have to run and get help
... stay away from my blood.
   `But you don't have to worry about getting my disease just from
being around me, even if I'm bleeding. Just remember to get an
adult to help me.''
   Jonathan's book says it is all right to touch him.
   ``It's OK for my mom to hug me. When she does, I feel safe and
loved. It would be awful not to feel loved.''
   The boy also talks about death.
   ``I like to watch the baby fish and frogs hatch in my aquarium.
It makes me sad when one of them dies. My mom says that everything
dies. I guess I know that, but sometimes I worry about dying.
   ``Many people who have had AIDS died. I hope that doctors will
find a cure.''

   Mayor Marion Barry appeared before a federal
magistrate today on a misdemeanor narcotics charge stemming from a
federal sting operation that law enforcement officials said caught
him on videotape buying and smoking crack cocaine.
   A federal magistrate ordered Barry to appear for a status
hearing Feb. 5, and required him to submit to drug testing every
Monday.
   Court papers filed by federal prosecutors said tests conducted
on blood and urine samples taken from the mayor following his
arrest Thursday night ``showed evidence of cocaine ingestion.''
   Barry, who has repeatedly denied drug use, was in court for 10
minutes and spoke only his name and swore to appear at the hearing.
   He was not asked to enter a plea to the charge of possessing a
controlled substance _ crack cocaine in this case. The charge
carries a maximum penalty of one year in jail and a fine of $5,000.
   His attorney, R. Kenneth Mundy, told the magistrate that Barry
wanted a jury trial and waived his right to a preliminary hearing.
He said the mayor would plead innocent.
   ``I am going to leave here and go about the business of
government,'' Barry told reporters outside the courthouse after the
hearing. He declined to discuss his legal or political future.
   Top city officials said Barry's plans to launch his campaign for
a fourth term on Sunday were being postponed indefinitely. Four
current or former city officials already were lined up to run
against the embattled mayor and Jesse Jackson also was understood
to be considering entering the race.
   Magistrate Deborah Robinson said Barry would remain free until
the hearing but she ordered him to telephone court ``pre-trial
services'' once a week.
   After the hearing, Barry was taken to a cellblock in the federal
courthouse to be booked.
   Barry seemed at ease and smiled before and after the hearing and
greeted well-wishers in the courtroom. While he waited for the
magistrate to appear, he sat with his wife, Effie, and talked with
her and his press secretary.
   ``The purpose of this hearing is to advise you of the charge,''
the magistrate told Barry. She then read the charge and told Barry
``you are not required to make any statement.''
   Barry swore to tell the truth and stated his name.
   Judith Retchin, an assistant U.S. attorney, said the government
did not oppose Barry's release on a personal bond and asked ``only
standard conditions'' for his release.
   U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens said after the hearing that the
undercover operation, which focused on allegations involving Barry,
was ``scrupulously fair'' and that the mayor was not entrapped.
``Where there is predisposition there is not entrapment,'' he said.
   According to court papers filed by federal prosecutors, the
mayor was observed by an FBI agent through a surveillance camera
giving ``a quantity of currency'' to a cooperating witness in
return for a quantity of the illegal drug.
   ``Mr. Barry put some of the crack cocaine in a smoking
apparatus, lit the crack cocaine and smoked it,'' FBI Agent Ronald
D. Stern said in an affidavit.
   The hotel room where Barry was arrested was rented for the
occasion by the FBI, according to the affidavit filed in U.S.
District Court.
   The affidavit filed in court said tests conducted on blood and
urine samples taken from the mayor following his arrest ``showed
evidence of cocaine ingestion.''
   The cocaine base was obtained from the Drug Enforcement
Administration ``in anticipation of an undercover operation,'' the
FBI affidavit stated.
   After his arrest at the hotel, Barry was released on his own
recognizance and spent the night at his home where he conferred
with city officials and lawyers.
   The FBI used a woman to get Barry to the hotel room but would
provide no further details, said a law enforcment source who spoke
on condition of anonymity. The woman was described by another
source familiar with the case as a low-level employee of the
District of Columbia government.
   Asked early today about the amount of drugs involved, Mundy
pinched his forefinger and thumb closely together and grinned.
   At the Justice Department, chief spokesman David Runkel said
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh had been told in advance of the
undercover operation.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Justice Department
officials notified Bush of Barry's arrest. Bush said he had no
comment about the incident.
   Barry's arrest resulted from a joint undercover ``public
corruption probe'' by the FBI and the internal affairs division of
the Washington Metropolitan Police Department, U.S. Attorney Jay
Stephens said in a statement.
   The arrest occurred a day before today's scheduled sentencing of
Charles Lewis, a former friend of the mayor and now a government
informant, for conspiracy to distribute cocaine. When Lewis pleaded
guilty to the charge last year, he told the judge he had given
cocaine to the mayor.
   Barry's troubles, coupled with the city's soaring homicide rate
that police attribute to drug-trafficking, have attracted
nationwide attention.
   Jackson, a two-time presidential candidate who has campaigned
against drugs across the country, fueled speculation he would run
for mayor when he moved to Washington last year. But Jackson said
he would not challenge Barry. He said today that he was ``stunned''
by the arrrest.
   Councilwoman Charlene Drew Jarvis, who has announced her
candidacy for mayor, said Barry's arrest ``changes the political
landscape of the city.''
   David Clarke, City Council chairman and a mayoral candidate,
called the arrest ``a tragic moment in our city's history.''
   Top city officials met into the early hours today to assess the
impact of the mayor's arrest on the operation of the District of
Columbia's government.
   WUSA-TV reported that Barry was lured to the hotel to visit a
longtime woman friend from California.
   The station said the FBI asked the woman to come to Washington a
week ago to set up a meeting with Barry. Barry made several
previous trips to see her during her stay, the station said. FBI
agents babysat the woman's children during her visit, according to
the report.
   An earlier federal investigation into allegations of cocaine use
by Barry was thwarted by the refusal of a woman, with whom the
mayor admitted having a ``personal relationship,'' to testify
before a grand jury.
   Karen Johnson, a former city worker who was convicted of drug
charges in 1984, was imprisoned for several months following her
refusal to testify about selling cocaine to Barry.

   Teen-agers will have a new excuse to
ask their parents for money for school _ a department store is
opening a branch at West Virginia's newest high school.
   Stone &amp; Thomas, a Wheeling-based retailer, plans to open its
Capital High School store Feb. 5. School officials say they believe
it might be the only such shop in the country.
   Students working at the store will earn credit toward the
school's business curriculum, but they won't be paid, school
officials said.
   Company executive Scott Williams says the store won't carry the
expensive designer brands of clothing, shoes, cosmetics and jewelry
that other Stone &amp; Thomas stores carry.
   ``Do we want to put $170 Polo jackets there? No. Do we want to
put college logo sweatshirts there? Yes,'' Williams said.
   He said the store also will carry greeting cards and school

   Metro-Dade police are giving out more tickets these
days _ but they're citing motorists for good driving and the
tickets are worth something.
   Perpetrators of considerate motoring habits on Dade County roads
will be pulled over and issued a citation _ redeemable at concerts,
sporting events and movie theaters.
   ``The first impression will be, `What did I do now?''' said
program coordinator John Jones, who admits the flashing lights and
sirens may confuse some drivers.
   The first good driver rewarded, Juanita Moore Murray of
Hollywood, said her first reaction was to check her speedometer,
then begin to worry. ``I was just thinking, all I need is a
ticket,'' she said Thursday.
   Jones gave her two _ to a Janet Jackson concert.
   The officer had spotted Murray, who drives a minibus for the
Jewish Community Center Senior Ride Service, letting another driver
pull onto the street from a parking lot.
   ``After all, we say we practice courtesy and safe driving,'' she
said.

<HEAD>Twin Brothers Celebrate 80th Birthday, More Than 60 Years of Work</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ERIE, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roy and Ralph Reisenberg each got a bottle of
gin and a golf umbrella Friday at an office party celebrating the
twin brothers' 80th birthday and a lifetime of working together.
   ``We've been in business together for more than 60 years,'' Roy
Reisenberg said. ``We're the oldest twin bank employees in the
United States.''
   For about 17 years, Roy Reisenberg has been a mail clerk and his
brother has verified account signatures in the operations center of
Marine Bank of Erie. Before that, they owned a tavern for about 16
years and ran a wholesale food business for 30 years.
   Ralph Reisenberg said he tried retirement before joining the
bank. ``We went to Florida for a few weeks, and I came home and sat
around for a few days and said, `Hey, this is no fun,' so I went
out and got a job.''
   Ralph Reisenberg's wife, Martha, died in May, after 53 years of
marriage. He lives in an apartment near his brother and
sister-in-law's Erie home.
   Working 20 hours a week keeps the two brothers going.
   ``It gets you out,'' Ralph Reisenberg said. ``You don't sit in a
saloon all day. There must be about 90 girls around here. There's
about six men. You can't beat that.''
   Roy Reisenberg said the men, avid golfers, have no plans to
retire.
   ``As long as my legs hold out, I'll be here,'' he said.
   When the brothers arrived Friday morning _ early, as usual _
they were greeted with a sign blinking birthday greetings outside
the building. Co-workers had rented it for the occasion.
   Bank President Dave Zuern congratulated the Reisenbergs as they
walked in, and the two found their offices decorated with balloons
and streamers.
   About 150 co-workers showed up for the birthday party, where the
men received $50 apiece and other gifts.
   Bank spokeswoman Ann Speice said the brothers are conscientious
workers. ``They are at work early every day. They never call in
sick.''
   Ralph Reisenberg said many of his friends have moved or died,
and he is grateful for his brother.
   ``We're different, but we get along _ for 80 years now,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Appeal Arguments Given in Deportation Case of IRA Member</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERA HALLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An attorney for an imprisoned Irish Republican
Army member argued Friday that the Justice Department overstepped
the law in its efforts to deport the man to Northern Ireland.
   The hearing before the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was the
latest proceeding in Joe Doherty's highly publicized, 6{-year legal
battle to fight extradition and deportation.
   If he loses, Doherty could be returned to face life in prison
for the 1980 killing of a British army captain and a later prison
escape. Doherty, 34, has been imprisoned since his arrest at a
Manhattan bar in June 1983.
   The British government maintains Doherty is a common criminal
who should be extradited to face trial. He and his supporters
maintain he committed a political act not subject to extradition
and that he deserves political asylum; the IRA says it is fighting
to oust the British from Northern Ireland.
   Doherty has won decisions before two federal judges, a federal
appeals court, an immigration judge and three immigration appeals
boards.
   But in June 1988, Attorney General Edwin Meese III intervened
and ordered his deportation. Later, Attorney General Richard
Thornburgh overturned an immigration appeals board decision to
reopen Doherty's deportation case.
   The hearing Thursday stemmed from Doherty's appeal of the
rulings by Meese and Thornburgh. If his appeal is successful,
Doherty will be granted another round in immigration courts, this
time to apply for political asylum.
   As throughout his legal battle, emotions ran high at the
hearing. Doherty was not present, but the courtroom was filled with
his supporters.
   His attorney, Mary Pike, asserted that the attorneys general
improperly intervened in Doherty's case.
   ``What we see in this case is the naked manipulation of an
administrative proceeding,'' Pike told the three judges hearing the
appeal.
   She said the central issue was that ``the attorney general is
not above the law and that no individual, including my client, is
outside the law.''
   Pike also noted that 46 members of Congress had signed a brief
supporting Doherty's position.
   Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Noel Anne Ferris argued that the
appeal should be denied because Doherty had earlier conceded that
he is deportable and had waived his right to apply for political
asylum.
   Ferris also said Meese was correct in ruling that it was in the
interest of the U.S. government to deport Doherty. ``It was in our
interest as a country fighting terrorism to return'' Doherty, she
said.
   The three judges _ Wilfred Feinberg, George Pratt and Edward
Lumbard _ reserved decision and will issue a written opinion at a
later date.

   Soviet miners visiting the United States
said Friday they didn't believe last year's coal strikes in their
homeland were very successful.
   Nine miners who belong to a new Soviet coal miners union are
touring Appalachian coal fields this month, comparing techniques
and labor organizations, and said their own battle had a long way
to go.
   ``It turns out we're not fighting against an owner but a
government system,'' miner Gennady Sharov said during a stop in
southern West Virginia. ``To win, we have to change laws. As it
turns out, it isn't just a strike for coal miners but for the
nation.''
   The group of Russian, Ukranian and Kazakh miners all were
prominent players in last summer's coal strike which ended after
Soviet leaders agreed to recognize their union and negotiate better
salaries and work and safety rules.
   Miner Oleg Kul said the coal strike was the first critical move
by Soviet workers in 70 years.
   ``It's an important step to solidify perestroika and
democratization that has been going on for five years,'' Kul said.
Perestroika is the Soviet government's relaxation of hard-line
restrictions.
   Kul and Sharov each believe miners have the backing of the
Soviet Politburo but that they are fighting a middle-level of
Soviet administration.
   ``They worry about what will happen if our demands are met. They
don't want to make changes. They're passive about it,'' Kul said.
``They say, `What can I do? I have no rights, just as you don't.'''
   Kul said Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev seems ready to
declare war on the middle administration to ensure changes filter
down to the working class. ``As far as the strike and negotiations
went, the government supported the right of the miners to go on
strike,'' he said.
   The group arrived in the United States two weeks ago and visited
leaders of United Mine Workers of America and the AFL-CIO in New
York and Washington, D.C. before traveling to West Virginia.

   Riot police with attack dogs
beat and tear gassed anti-apartheid demonstrators Friday protesting
the visit of an English cricket team defying a ban on sports
contacts with South Africa.
   Squads of police armed with batons and pump-action shotguns tore
into a crowd of about 100 peaceful protesters at Jan Smuts Airport
as police handlers unleashed German shepherd attack dogs that bit
protesters and knocked them to the ground.
   Fleeing demonstrators fell on each other and were trapped as
they scrambled to escape the dogs. Police beat protesters with long
batons as they lay on the ground, trying to ward off the blows.
   Police hauled off several protesters with blood pouring from
head cuts and other wounds. Police said 10 protesters were arrested.
   The cricket team, called ``rebels'' because of their defiance of
the ban on sport ties with South Africa's white-minority
government, arrived three hours late after a bomb threat delayed
the departure of their South African Airways flight from London.
Police dispersed the protesters before the team arrived.
   Team captain Mike Gatting expressed unhappiness when told about
the protest, but said the team would go ahead with the six-week
tour. Team members reportedly are receiving $160,000 each for the
tour, with Gatting receiving $320,000.
   ``We're unhappy that if it was a peaceful demonstration, that it
was disrupted,'' Gatting said at an airport news conference.
   Anti-government protesters vowed to disrupt the tour despite a
police warning that no demonstrations would be allowed.
   ``Our message to Gatting and his gang ... (is) we are definitely
going to make his life miserable here. Our objective is to stop the
tour,'' said Benny Alexander, general-secretary of the Pan
Africanist Movement.
   Demonstrators in six buses arrived at the airport, where police
at first prevented them from leaving the buses. ``Ban racist
tours,'' said signs carried by protesters along with the green,
black and yellow flag of the outlawed African National Congress,
the main black political organization.
   ``Viva ANC!'' protesters chanted.
   About 100 protesters later were allowed to march to the
terminal, where they gathered in a crowd, peacefully singing and
dancing. After a few minutes, riot police moved into the crowd
after it was ordered to disperse.
   A senior police officer said the demonstration was illegal
because the protesters failed to obtain a magistrate's permit. He
said violence used by police was not excessive.
   Police seized film from Associated Press photographers and
others.
   Geoff Dakin, head of the South African Cricket Union, which
organized the tour, said the airport incident was an everyday event
of a kind that happens all over the world.
   Winnie Mandela, wife of jailed black leader Nelson Mandela, and
several other black leaders at the airport protested against the
police tactics. Mrs. Mandela said the police tactics undermined
President F. W. DeKlerk's claim he wants to dismantle apartheid.
   ``We saw unlimited violence unleashed towards our people here,''
she said.

   Investigators say they have recovered more
than $500,000 in stolen antiques _ including two centuries-old
violins and a sword reportedly used by Civil War General William T.
Sherman.
   The merchandise, which also included books, coin collections,
toy cars and guns, was found Thursday in a storage locker.
   ``We're saying half-a-million dollars right now, but that's
probably a very conservative estimate,'' said Dennis Palmentera, an
investigator with the Ohio Organized Crime Investigation Commission.
   Police have arrested 29 people since a grand jury in Columbus,
Ohio, returned secret indictments Jan. 2 in connection with an
Ohio-based burglary ring, but no arrests have been made involving
the Savannah cache.
   Investigators say the ring has operated for 20 years and is
blamed for more than $1.8 million in thefts over five years.
   ``The ring had fingered out from Ohio,'' said Harold Crabtree,
also an investigator with the Ohio task force. ``It spread from
Ohio to Florida and was in every state in between.''
   The Sherman-related items, which included a portrait of the
Union general, were stolen from Sherman's birthplace museum in
Lancaster, Ohio, investigators said.
   The violins were believed made by Antonio Stradivari, the famous
Italian craftsman.
   Palmentera said investigators believe the antiques stashed in
Savannah were destined for a major antiques show in Norcross.
   ``They store it for six months or a year until it cools off,
then they'd sell it,'' Palmentera said. ``They sell it in the major
shows because this stuff is hard to track.''

   Peggy McMartin Buckey, acquitted in the
McMartin Pre-School molestation case, said today she would pursue a
federal civil lawsuit alleging malicious prosecution despite death
threats to her family.
   Mrs. Buckey, addressing a packed news conference, said she at
first hesitated to become involved in further litigation.
   ``I said to (my lawyer) `Is it worth going to court about? I'm
tired of going to court. I'm tired of enduring what I've had to
endure.'''
   But she said she felt those responsible for ruining her life
should have to account for it.
   Mrs. Buckey and her son Raymond won acquittal of 52 felony child
molestation charges. Jurors in the nation's longest and costliest
criminal trial Thursday deadlocked on 12 other sex abuse counts
against Buckey and a single conspiracy count against him and his
63-year-old mother.
   Superior Court Judge William Pounders declared a mistrial on the
12 counts and dismissed the deadlocked conspiracy charge against
Mrs. Buckey. He set a Jan. 31 hearing to determine whether the 13
unresolved counts will be dismissed against Buckey.
   Buckey, 31, who spent nearly five years in jail before making
bail, and his mother, who was jailed for almost two years, cried as
they heard the verdicts.
   ``If it can happen to seven innocent people it can happen to
you, too. If it had not been in my faith in God, I wouldn't be here
today,'' Mrs. Buckey said.
   Buckey avoided reporters after the verdict.
   Initially, five other teachers, including Mrs. Buckey's mother
and daughter, were charged.
   The trial cost about $15 million and lasted nearly three years.
   The lawsuit filed today names as defendants Los Angeles County,
the city of Manhattan Beach, former District Attorney Robert
Philibosian, Children's Institute International and therapist Kee
McFarlane, as well as Capital Cities-ABC Inc. and its former
reporter Wayne Satz.
   It contended that all defendants joined in a conspiracy to have
the McMartin defendants indicted. The lawsuit sought general
damages of $1 million and unspecified special damages.
   Mrs. Buckey said that after verdicts were announced Thursday, a
parent of a McMartin school child approached Mrs. Buckey's husband,
Charles, and threatened to kill him. She did not elaborate.
   She also said that children who attended the once prestigious,
but now defunct, school trailed her to her car and screamed
epithets at her.
   Some of the children's parents gasped when the verdicts were
announced.
   ``The anger is beginning to rise,'' said Mary Mae Cioffi. ``We
have programs all over the country that tell children to run and
tell when somebody hurts them, and our children told. Some of them
spent 35 days on the stand and they get a `not guilty.' It shows
that our justice system needs a revamp for kids.''
   Although they did not testify, she added: ``I know my children
were molested. I had my daughter sleep between my husband and I for
a whole year because she was so afraid somebody would come and get
her, that they would kill her, because she told.''
   The investigation of alleged mass molestation at the family-run
school in suburban Manhattan Beach ignited a nationwide wave of
worry about child abuse when it came to light in 1983. It produced
widespread fear among working parents that their children might be
at risk at school.
   Jurors who cleared the pair Thursday said children may have been
molested. But they said prosecutors in the trial failed to link
sexual abuse to the defendants.
   ``I tried to believe the children,'' said juror Daryl Hutchins.
   But he said the youngsters had been so ``contaminated'' by
parents' suggestions and therapists who interviewed them that he
could not accept their testimony.
   The most important evidence, jurors said, were videotapes of
interviews conducted with alleged victims at Children's Institute
International, a private child abuse center. The jurors said
interviewers used leading questions and coached the children on how
they should answer.
   ``I believe that the children believed what they were saying was
true in the courtroom,'' said juror Brenda Williams. ``I could not
tell from watching the tape that the children were telling what
actually happened to them or if they were repeating what their
parents told them.''
   Some parents said the judicial system failed.
   ``I fear that because of this verdict, no child will be seen as
a credible witness from now on,'' said Alan Lagunoff. His son, now
10, attended the school for 1{ years but wasn't a witness at the
trial.
   Prosecutor Lael Rubin, who devoted six years to the case, said:
``We ultimately must respect the jury's decision even though I
personally disagree with it.''
   The case began in August 1983 with a complaint from Judy
Johnson, a mother who reported her 2-year-old child had been
molested at the suburban school by a man called Ray.
   Police sent letters to McMartin parents warning of possible
molestation. Soon, dozens of parents reported their children had
been victimized.
   Mrs. Johnson, suffering from alcohol and mental problems, died
at age 44 a few months before the trial began in April 1987.
Defense attorneys contended the case was largely the result of her
increasingly bizarre allegations.
   Children gave accounts of satanic rites and animals tortured to
frighten youngsters into silence. Testimony at an 18-month
preliminary hearing featured tales of molestations at a church, a
car wash and a market as well as ``naked games'' at the school.
   Juror Julie Peters said she felt the case had destroyed many
lives.
   ``I think everybody was a victim,'' she said. ``I don't think
anybody came out of this case a winner.''

   A federal judge today refused to order government
investigators to stay away from defense witnesses in the case of a
co-defendant of Manuel Noriega.
   But U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler urged both sides to
avoid intimidation.
   An attorney for Luis del Cid, alleged to be a top aide to
Noriega _ complained to the court that investigators from the
Immigration and Naturalization Service visited the defendants's
wife and two friends soon after the three testified at a bond
hearing this week.
   ``These witnesses declined to go back to court today _ they are
terrified,'' said attorney Samuel Burstyn.
   ``They are worried about their immigration status.''
   Del Cid's wife is Panamanian and the other two women are
Nicaraguan refugees.
   But Hoeveler noted the women _ Tilsa del Cid and Norma and
Eglantina Alvarez _ had offered to take custody of del Cid if he is
freed on bond.
   ``It is important for me to get the full picture of what their
status is,'' Hoeveler said.
   INS agents had demanded that three women who testified for del
Cid on Tuesday turn over all their immigration papers and give
information about how they gained entry into the United States,
Burstyn wrote in a request for the emergency hearing.
   ``The timing reflects vividly that this is a retaliatory measure
aimed at intimidating these and other defense witnesses,'' said
Burstyn.
   On Tuesday, the Alvarez sisters testified that del Cid helped
them flee into Panama to avoid persecution by the Sandinistas.
   In his motion Thursday, Burstyn said that immigration agents had
asked the sisters whether they once worked for Nicaragua's
Sandinista government and ``implied that there was something
improper about their escape into Panama.''
   Earlier Thursday, Burstyn and other defense attorneys accused
the government of balking at court orders to turn over both secret
and non-secret documents to aid the defense.
   ``There is a desire to stonewall information ... to hermetically
seal off the guts and gore of the early investigation,'' said
Burstyn, adding that he hoped the tentative March 5 trial date for
Noriega would force the government to stop dragging his feet.
   Prosecutors last week threatened to try Michael O'Kane, lawyer
for the accused drug pilot Daniel Miranda, for mentioning the
existence of a National Security Agency listening post in Panama
City _ despite the fact the office is shown on a map in the Panama
City telephone book.
   Also, a lawyer for convicted drug kingpin Carlos Lehder Rivas
strongly denied his client will cooperate with prosecutors to
convict the deposed Panamanian leader, despite a taped interview
the imprisoned trafficker gave implicating Noriega.
   ``He will be no witness against Noriega, there is no deal,''
Lehder's attorney Jose Quinon said Thursday.

<TEXT>
   Anglican envoy Terry Waite begins his
fourth year as a hostage of pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem militants on
Saturday with his fate, and those of other captives, apparently
hinging on a power struggle in Tehran.
   A reliable Shiite source, who is familiar with the thinking of
the hostage-holding factions, said the issue of the 18 Westerners
missing in Lebanon is ``on the back burner'' until Iran's political
infighting is settled.
   ``Any settlement to the hostage issue must await the outcome of
the power struggle in Iran,'' the source said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Waite, 50, disappeared in Moslem west Beirut Jan. 20, 1987. He
was last seen leaving his seaside hotel to keep a rendezvous with
kidnappers holding two Americans _ journalist Terry Anderson and
Scottish-born educator Thomas Sutherland _ to negotiate their
release.
   No group has claimed it holds Waite and there has been no word
on his fate. But Western and Lebanese intelligence officials are
convinced he is held by Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, the
group holding Anderson and Sutherland. British intelligence sources
said they believe he is still alive.
   Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie said he is confident his
envoy will be released.
   ``There are others who have been unheard of for longer and I
remain optimistic that Terry is there and that one day he will
return to us,'' the Anglican leader said in an interview televised
Friday in London.
   David Waite said on the program he believed his brother was
alive.
   ``Although there seems to be nothing visible happening, I'm just
very hopeful that some time, and please let it be soon, we will see
this situation start to turn around. Logically it's got to come to
an end some time,'' he said.
   Waite is one of 18 Westerners, including eight Americans,
missing in Lebanon.
   Most are believed held by factions of the Iranian-backed Shiite
fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party of God. The longest held is
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press,
who was kidnapped in Beirut on March 16, 1985.
   Their ordeal has been complicated by a split in Hezbollah
between the political wing aligned with Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani and radicals allied with former interior minister Ali
Akbar Mohtashemi.
   Rafsanjani, who dumped Mohtashemi from his Cabinet in August,
has sought to rebuild ties with the West to attract foreign
investment badly needed for economic reconstruction following the
1988 cease-fire in the war with Iraq.
   This is anathema to the fundamentalist radicals, who fear it
will undermine revolutionary fervor and the hard-line legacy of
revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who died June 3.
   Rafsanjani appears to be willing to use Tehran's influence to
free the hostages, and improve Iran's image, provided the United
States releases Iranian assets worth billions of dollars frozen in
1979.
   The virulently anti-Western Mohtashemi, on the other hand, has
close links with Hezbollah. He was a key figure in forming the
movement in the early 1980s and masterminding suicide bomber
attacks on U.S., French and Israeli forces that killed hundreds of
people.
   ``The kidnappers are radicals who owe allegiance to
Mohtashemi,'' the source said.
   An anonymous telephone caller, purporting to represent the
pro-Iranian Organization of the Oppressed on Earth, another Shiite
faction, threatened to kill Waite in August unless Israel freed a
kidnapped Shiite leader, Sheik Abdul-Karim Obeid.
   The Hezbollah cleric was seized by Israeli commandoes in a
pre-dawn raid in July on his village in south Lebanon. Obeid was
not released, but there was no further call claiming Waite had been
slain.

   Broadway composer and lyricist Stephen
Sondheim began his new role Friday as professor, addressing an
overflow crowd of 250 at Oxford University.
   ``I've always had an enormous, passionate feeling about teaching
and teachers,'' he said in the inaugural lecture of his term at
Oxford's St. Catherine's College.
   Sondheim, who wrote the music and lyrics for such shows as
``Company,'' ``A Little Night Music,'' ``Follies'' and ``Into the
Woods,'' is the first visiting professor of drama and musical
theater at Oxford University in a post that has been endowed by
British producer Cameron Mackintosh.
   Sondheim is in intermittent residence in Oxford, where he is
guiding 13 students through a term that will focus on their own
compositions as well as on the London production of ``Sunday in the
Park with George,'' Sondheim's Pulitzer Prize-winning musical.
   ``All the people in this course have a feeling for the
theater,'' Sondheim said of his students, who were selected from
among 92 applicants. Eleven of the students are British, one is
Canadian and one Australian.
   After a week working with their professor, the students are
giving Sondheim rave reviews.
   ``The guy's a tremendous human being. It's a great surprise. Not
what you'd expect of a great maestro,'' said Edward Hardy, 23. ``He
has a tremendous relaxing manner and a fantastic sense of humor.
   ``Stephen Sondheim is exactly the sort of person whom you feel
you can approach,'' Hardy said.

<HEAD>Israeli Raids in Lebanon Kill 5</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By AHMED MANTASH</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SIDON, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli warplanes Friday rocketed a PLO
radio station and guerrilla bases of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah in
their first two air strikes on south Lebanon this year. Police said
five people were killed and 12 wounded.
   The attacks targeted Radio Al-Quds, or Radio Jerusalem, in the
Palestinian refugee camp of Mieh Mieh near the port of Sidon and
Hezbollah bases in four villages further south.
   Two other people were missing after the 77-minute raid on Mieh
Mieh, which destroyed the two transmission aerials of the radio, a
police spokesman said.
   He said six Phantom F-4 fighter-bombers fired 34 rockets in
seven runs in Mieh Mieh, killing at least three people and wounding
eight others.
   Palestinian guerrillas fired ground-to-air missiles that were
deflected by scarlet heat balloons released by the pilots of the
raiding jets.
   The police spokesman said Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation
Organization was readying the station to transmit programs to the
uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza strip.
   The station had been in the process of test broadcasts and was
to be inaugurated Feb. 1, said the spokesman, who cannot be
identified under standing rules.
   Guerrillas from Arafat's mainstream Fatah faction ringed the
vicinity of the stricken station and stopped reporters and
photographers from approaching, pending a security check of the
area for possible time bombs.
   In Jerusalem, the Israeli military command confirmed the two
raids, adding that all the jets returned safely to base.
   It said the radio station ``was intended to broadcast orders to
guerrillas in Lebanon and hostile groups'' in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
   Israeli jets last year also destroyed a Fatah radio station in
south Lebanon. Israeli army officials said the station had been
used to transmit orders to the uprising.
   Smoke billowed from several parts of the stricken shantytown on
the southeastern fringe of Sidon, provincial capital of south
Lebanon, 25 miles from Beirut.
   The spokesman said several delayed-fuse rockets were fired in an
attempt to blast the underground structure of the station, but no
word on the damage was immediately available.
   A formation of four Israeli jets earlier rocketed outposts of
Hezbollah, Iran's main Shiite Moslem ally in Lebanon, in the
embattled Apple Province, six miles southeast of sidon.
   Police said at least two guerrillas were killed and four wounded
in the two rocketing sorties of the overnight raid.
   The targeted bases were in the villages of Ein Bouswar, Lwaize,
Mlikh and Jabal Safi.
   The Israeli command said its warplanes raided Hezbollah bases
north of the market town of Nabatiyeh that were used to mount
guerrilla attacks against Israel's northern border.
   The raid followed two Katyusha rocket attacks on northern Israel
Sunday and on the zone Israel has controlled in south Lebanon since
1982.
   The zone is patrolled by an estimated 1,500 Israeli troops and
the 3,000-member South Lebanon Army, a predominantly Christian
militia sponsored by Israel.
   Hezbollah sources in Beirut acknowledged the Israeli raid on
their bases in the Apple Province, but refused to discuss damage or
casualties.
   ``They fired devastating rockets on our bases,'' said one
Hezbollah source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The fundamentalist Hezbollah and the secular Syrian-backed Amal
militia have been engaged in a new round of fighting in the region
since Dec. 23. At least 97 people have been killed and 277 wounded
in that confrontation, by police count.
   The two factions have been vying for more than two years for
mastery of the 1.2 million Shiites who make up Lebanon's largest
single sect.
   The raids were Israel's first and second on Lebanon this year.
At least 28 people were killed and 137 wounded in Israel's 18 air
strikes against Palestinian and Lebanese guerrilla bases in 1989.

   The long-awaited launch of the
Hubble Space Telescope will be delayed from March to April because
of a problem with one of space shuttle Discovery's solid fuel
booster rockets, NASA said today.
   The $1.7 billion spacecraft is scheduled to become astronomy's
most significant tool in expanding knowledge of the universe into
the 21st century.
   The space agency said shuttle managers decided to exchange one
of the motor segments on the right booster rocket because there was
a question whether a check was done properly. Assembly operations
have advanced to the point where the test cannot be repeated, NASA
said.
   The launch was scheduled for March 26. Estimates of the delay
range from 10 days to two weeks.
   The next shuttle mission, that of Atlantis on a military
mission, also faces a delay of a few days in its planned Feb. 16
launch. The move of the spaceship to an assembly building was held
up two days by a problem with the left main landing gear.
   There also reportedly were some minor problems with the Pentagon
payload.
   Scientists have eagerly awaited the Hubble launch since well
before its original liftoff date in 1985. Early technical problems
and the 1986 space shuttle Challenger explosion resulted in the
long delay.
   Orbiting 370 miles high, the telescope will look seven times
more deeply into space and detect objects 50 times fainter than the
best ground-based observatory.

<TEXT>
   Mongolia's Communist Party daily newspaper on
Friday warned a pro-reform group not to push too far in the first
official criticism of the remote Asian nation's fledgling reform
movement.
   A foreign source in the capital of Ulan Bator said the comments
in the daily Unen came after a street rally Jan. 13 that attracted
up to 5,000 people and several incidents of vandalism this week,
including the theft of a small statue of Stalin.
   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said one article
in the paper pinpointed several leaders of the newly formed
Mongolian Democratic Union, and said they were going ``too far'' in
pushing for democratic reform.
   It also named several journalists and a teaching assistant at
the state university as being leaders of the union, and urged them
to ``stop and think'' before proceeding with their campaign.
   A milder article written by the head of the party ideology
department called on reformists to work together with the party,
and said the party shared such objectives as speeding up the pace
of ``perestroika'' and carrying out electoral reform.
   The MDU, thought to be comprised mainly of intellectuals and
artists, staged two rallies in December that drew crowds in the
hundreds, and then held the larger Jan. 13 demonstration.
   During the latest demonstration, speakers for the first time
criticized government leaders by name and demanded that Yumjaagiyn
Tsedenbal, Mongolia's autocratic ruler for more than three decades
before he was purged in 1984, be put on trial.
   The demonstrators were given permission for all three rallies
and police made no attempt to interfere.
   The source said that in the past week a small statue of Stalin
in front of an officers' club was stolen, while paint was thrown on
the pedestal of a larger Stalin statue in front of the Stalin
Museum.
   A statue of Horloogiyn Choybalsan, the Stalinist leader who
carried out bloody purges of opponents and Mongolian Buddhists
during the 1930s, was also smeared with paint. It was not known who
was responsible for the acts.
   Mongolia, a nation of only 2 million people scattered across a
nation nearly the size of West Europe, has been a client state of
the Soviet Union since the Communists took power in 1921.
   It has cautiously taken up the economic and political reforms
advanced by Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, although little
progress has been made in introducing market principles and there
has been no serious challenge, like in East Europe, to Communist
Party rule.
   ``No one is looking for a great confrontation such as happened
in East Europe,'' the source said. ``It's a very different cultural
mileau here.''
   The source said the MDU plans to hold another rally this Sunday.
He said it was difficult to predict whether the authorities, now
that they have criticized the movement, will try to stop it. ``All
of this is so new,'' he said.

   A couple apparently left six children in an
apartment without food, heat or electricity, police said.
   Acting on a tip from an elementary school teacher, police
discovered the children, ages 6 to 17, Thursday. They would not
release the children's names and have not been able to locate the
parents.
   The children said they have not seen their mother since
December, and had not seen their father since Tuesday, Nashua
Police Sgt. John McDermott said.
   McDermott said there was little food in the apartment except
bread and potato chips.
   The children had been attending school, and were taken to stay
with a grandfather in Lowell, Mass.
   The state Division for Children and Youth Services has been
asked to investigate, McDermott said. If the parents are found they
could be charged with endangering the welfare of a child, a
misdemeanor punishable by one year in jail, he said.

<TEXT>
   The brigadier general stood on a
wind-swept observation post overlooking the Demilitarized Zone and
challenged observers Friday to find a barrier like the Berlin Wall
on the bleak plain below.
   ``Kim Il Sung is a liar. Can you see any concrete wall as
claimed by him?'' asked Brig. Gen. Kang Jong-pil.
   Kim, North Korea's Communist leader, had said South Korea built
such a wall on the 2{-mile-wide DMZ to block free travel between
the nations, and he called on South Korea to tear it down.
   Kang, a deputy army division commander, was briefing about 100
foreign reporters allowed for the first time to visit two
front-line units on the 155-mile border as part of Seoul's effort
to disprove the North Korean claim.
   The identity of Kang's unit was withheld as a military secret.
   The Korean DMZ is one of the most heavily fortified borders in
the world and sealed off by more than 1.5 million troops on both
sides. The nations are still technically at war since no peace
treaty was signed at the end of the Korean War in 1953.
   There were no concrete walls as claimed by Kim in the two South
Korean units visited by foreign reporters on Thursday. At Kang's
unit, a 1.6-mile-long anti-tank obstacle was shown to the press.
   ``I am not sure but I think this is the very concrete wall that
Kim Il Sung mentioned in his New Year's address,'' the general said
through an interpreter.
   ``If we remove these tank traps, it is just like giving them
guarantee for free passage of tanks,'' he said.
   The general said Kim, apparently embarrassed by sweeping changes
in East Europe, is believed to have mentioned the non-existent
concrete wall.
   ``It's nothing but false propaganda aimed at shifing
responsibility for national division to the South,'' he said.
   The general said anti-tank barriers are set up along only 12
percent of the 12-mile frontline in his unit's sector. No tank
traps were seen at the other adjacent unit visited by the reporters.
   The anti-tank obstacle shown at Kim's unit, 16{ feet high and 21
feet wide at its bottom, is made of rocks, cement and dirt. It lies
just outside the DMZ across a vast open field that formed one of
the bloodiest battlefields during the Korean War.
   About 19,000 troops on both sides were killed or wounded in
battles in the plain and a nearby ridge during the three-year war,
Kang said.
   At the start of the Korean War, North Korea threw in nearly a
third of its 250 tanks to occupy the area and they rolled to Seoul,
50 miles away, in three days, he said.
   According to the general, North Korea, has also fortified its
own sector of the DMZ with multiple electric fences and two lines
of anti-tank barriers.
   Kang said all South Korean barriers have been built outside the
DMZ but one of North Korea's anti-tank obstacles is located inside
the DMZ, a clear violation of the 1953 Korean Armistice Agreement.
   Reporters could not verify Kang's claim through binoculars
because of hazy weather.
   At a nearby unit 25 miles away, reporters were takne to a guard
post inside the southern sector of the DMZ, where they heared North
Korea's broadcasts blaring propaganda criticizing the United States
as well as South Korea.
   ``If Yankees go home, the Korean peninsula will become a
paradise,'' the barely audible broadcasts said.

   Hungary's top military officer Friday
called for a ``remarkable reform'' of the Warsaw Pact but said the
military alliance was needed to maintain stability in Europe.
   Winding up the first week of unprecedented East-West talks, Gen.
Laszlo Borsits said Hungary would stay in the Soviet-led alliance
``for the time being.''
   His remarks generally reflected those of other East European
officers who have stressed their national interests over those of
the Warsaw Pact. They have not, however, talked about leaving the
alliance.
   ``One of the lessons after this week is the Warsaw Pact is still
there,'' said John Maresca, who heads the U.S. delegation to the
talks.
   Gunter Joetze, West Germany's ambassador to the meeting, noted
the tendency of the East European countries to discuss their
national policies.
   ``There is no more bloc discipline. Everybody talks about what
he (wants),'' said Joetze.
   Maresca described the initial days of the three-week conference
as ``a mixed experience.''
   The meeting opened Tuesday with Gen. Colin Powell, the chairman
of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, and his Soviet counterpart, Gen.
Mikhail Moiseyev, discussing the superpowers' policies.
   Western analysts had been eager to hear the East bloc views
following the tremendous political upheavals there.
   Maresca said the first week of the closed-door discussions had
been marked by formality, with senior military officers not
engaging in the hoped-for give-and-take.
   ``That has been the disappointment of this week _ the discussion
session,'' he said. ``There hasn't been a lot.''
   Poland's ambassador, Wlodzimierz Konarski, expressed relief the
generals' talks had been ``quiet and constructive without any
tensions.''
   Maresca said a key result of the gathering had been the informal
contacts that set ``excellent groundwork'' for later discussions.
   Powell met privately with Moiseyev and had lunch with chiefs of
other Warsaw Pact nations.
   Joetze believed there was ``much more dialogue'' among the
nations than he had expected.
   ``We were afraid that the Soviets would stonewall and would make
only general political declarations,'' he said. But, he said,
``they did not. They talked in military substance.''
   Maresca contended, though, the Soviets' formal remarks were
``about what one would have expected at this time.''
   Moiseyev offered a wide range of criticisms about U.S. and NATO
policies and urged the West to follow Moscow's lead in cutting
troops, arms and spending.
   The Soviets' allies appeared more open. ``There's something of a
contrast ... between the behavior of the Eastern Europeans and the
behavior of the Soviets,'' Maresca said.
   Poland released a detailed paper on its defense forces that gave
not only budget and manpower figures but also naval insignia.
   Borsits, reflecting the new Eastern approach, said in his speech
that Hungary ``no longer gives priority to military power.''
   ``The role of the military factor should be gradually but
considerably reduced,'' he said.
   But, he said the Warsaw Pact and the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization ``are nowadays a stabilizing factor.''
   ``Their loosening would upset the balance and would lead to
incalculable consequences,'' he said.
   But, he said, ``we consider necessary and urge a remarkable
reform of the (Warsaw Pact) alliance, above all the democratization
and modernization of inner relationships and decision-making
mechanisms.''
   Hungary planned to cut its army by a third, he said. Battle
tanks, field artillery and combat planes would be slashed even
more. Defense spending also would come down, he said.
   The meeting was held under the auspices of the negotiations on
Confidence- and Security-Building Measures, bargaining among NATO,
Warsaw Pact and neutral nations aimed at easing military tensions
in Europe.
   The agenda for the next two weeks will include discussion of the
structures of East-West armed forces, military training and budgets.

   Elizabeth sued Exxon Friday, charging the
recent oil spill into the Arthur Kill ravaged its waterfront and
polluted the Elizabeth River.
   ``This represents a terrible, terrible setback'' in a 17-year
effort to clean up the waterfront, said city health director John
Surmay.
   The Superior Court lawsuit seeks unspecified compensatory and
punitive damages. New Jersey also has sued Exxon.
   Surmay said damages to city property has been estimated at
$500,000 to $4.5 million. Elizabeth has 2 miles of waterfront on
the Arthur Kill, the waterway separating New Jersey from the New
York City borough of Staten Island.
   About 567,000 gallons of heating oil spilled into the channel
Jan. 1-2 when a pipeline ruptured. The pipeline linked Exxon's
Bayway refinery in Linden and its distribution terminal in Bayonne.
   Exxon was still seeking to determine the rupture's cause.
   Surmay said the city's 50-boat marina was damaged by the oil,
which also spread into the Elizabeth River. The river empties into
the kill.
   Wildlife on the shoreline and city-owned land on Shooter's
Island also suffered, Surmay said.
   Exxon was ``disappointed'' with Elizabeth's lawsuit, said
company spokesman Bill Young, because the company had already
started settlement negotiations.
   Young said Friday that crews were completing the clean-up. The
ruptured section of pipeline will be removed next week for
examination.

   Citing declining tension in
southern Africa, the government announced major defense cuts
Friday, including the disbanding of air force and navy units and
big cuts in weapons production.
   The cuts mainly affect the navy and air force with naval
personel being cut by almost 25 percent, including disbanding the
country's marine corps. The air force will lose six squadrons and
retire five classes of aircraft.
   President F.W. de Klerk announced recently that South Africa
would reduce its defense forces because of declining tension in
southern African and a need to redirect government spending to
social welfare projects.
   The defense budget is about $4 billion annually. There were no
figures on how much money would be saved by the cuts.
   South Africa last year ended its involvement in a 23-year bush
war against nationalist guerrillas in Namibia by agreeing to end
its rule of the territory. Namibia is scheduled to become
indpendent soon, probably in March.
   South Africa also withdrew its forces in 1988 from Angola, where
it fought alongside rebels battling the Marxist government.
   Lt. Gen. Kat Liebenberg, acting chief of the Defense Force, said
the cuts would make the military smaller and more economical, but
would not seriosuly reduce South Africa's ability to defend itself.
   ``The Defense Forces will justifiably remain true to its
reputation as a formidable fighting force that would compel any
military force in Southern Africa to think twice before embarking
on military adventures against our country,'' Liebenberg said.
   The army, the strongest arm of the defense forces with 75,000
troops, is least affected by the cuts and will remain the strongest
military force in Africa. Neighboring black African states have
much smaller, weaker armies.
   Liebenberg said South Africa still needed strong defense forces
despite the reduction in tension in the region. ``The threat to
South Africa has not totally disappeared,'' he said.
   The big cut involving the army was the cancellation of 11 major
weapons systems under development, the statement said. Another 49
projects were reduced or delayed, he said.
   Army operating costs will be drastically curtailed, the
statement said.
   The navy, the smallest arm of the military, was hardest hit by
the cuts, with the closing of five naval bases, disbanding of the
900-man marine corps and dismantling of the main regional naval
commands.
   Liebenberg said 2,000 naval personnel out of a force of about
9,000 would be dismissed or retired. The South African navy is
mainly a coastal defense force, except for three submarines and two
older frigates.
   Defense cuts will mean the elimination of six air force
squadrons and the phasing out of five classes of aircraft,
including the relatively old Canberra bomber and the Westland Wasp
helicopter. The air force has about 13,000 troops and 366 combat
aircraft.

<HEAD>Minnesota Supreme Court Upholds Fetal Homicide Statutes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It is not necessary to define when human
life begins to impose criminal penalties for killing a fetus, the
Minnesota Supreme Court ruled Friday.
   The court, in upholding Minnesota's 1986 fetal homicide
statutes, said the laws ``do not raise the issue of when life as a
human person begins or ends. The state must prove only that the
implanted embryo or the fetus in the mother's womb was living, that
it had life, and that it has life no longer.''
   The justices, in a 4-3 decision, held that the fetal homicide
statutes are constitutional even though they don't distinguish
between viable and non-viable fetuses.
   ``The defendant who assaults a pregnant woman causing the death
of the fetus she is carrying destroys the fetus without the consent
of the woman,'' the court said. ``This is not the same as the woman
who elects to have her pregnancy terminated by one legally
authorized to perform the act.''
   The U.S. Supreme Court's landmark 1973 ruling that legalized
abortion ``protects the woman's right of choice; it does not
protect, much less confer on an assailant, a third-party unilateral
right to destroy the fetus,'' the Minnesota justices said.
   The opinion was issued in the case of Sean Patrick Merrill of
Rochester, who has been charged with two counts each of first- and
second-degree murder in the November 1988 shooting deaths of
22-year-old Gail Anderson and her 4-week-old embryo.
   Rochester attorney Kevin Lund, Merrill's lawyer, said a decision
on whether to appeal further is expected within about a week.
   Olmsted County District Judge O. Russell Olson had denied
Merrill's motion to dismiss the charges relating to the embryo, but
asked for a ruling on the constitutionality of the 1986 fetal
homicide statutes.
   Olson said Minnesota's statutes ``represent the most sweeping
legislative attempt in the country to criminalize actions of third
parties which harm fetuses and embryos.''
   In rejecting Merrill's claim that the statutes were ``fatally
vague'' because they don't define the phrase ``causes the death of
an unborn child,'' the court split 4-3, with Associate Justice
Glenn Kelley breaking from the majority. Justices Rosalie Wahl and
A.M. ``Sandy'' Keith dissented from the entire majority opinion.
   Writing for the dissent, Kelley said that, without a statutory
definition, the phrase ``causes the death of an unborn child'' is
``burdened with ambiguity which ... invites arbitrary and
discriminatory enforcement.''
   Lund said he found it a ``a moral victory'' that three of the
seven justices found the ``death of unborn child'' phrasing
ambiguous. ``Unfortunately ... moral victories don't count in a
court of law,'' he said.
   Olmsted County Attorney Ray Schmitz, who defended the statutes
before the Supreme Court, said the justices were careful to
separate the fetal homicide issue from abortion.
   ``Our argument was that the constitutionally protected
relationship between mother and fetus is entirely different than
actions of a third party, and that is essentially what the court
said,'' he said.
   The challenged statutes impose criminal penalties for ``murder
of an unborn child'' in the first and second degrees. The penalties
of life imprisonment for conviction on a first-degree charge and up
to 40 years on a second-degree charge are the same as for murder.
   The statutes define ``unborn child'' as the ``offspring of a
human being conceived, but not yet born.''
   The court said it appeared Merrill was claiming that, because
the statutes do not distinguish between viable and non-viable
fetuses, he was exposed to conviction as a murderer of an unborn
child during the first trimester of pregnancy. On the other hand, a
woman who obtains a legal abortion under Roe vs. Wade and the
doctor who performs it are not murderers.
   The justices said, however, that the focus of the Roe vs. Wade
decision was on protecting a pregnant woman from governmental
interference or compulsion.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Calls for International Program to Salvage Environment</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Soviet-Unrest, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev Friday called for
an international program to save the environment.
   Speaking to the Global Forum on the Environment and Development
for Survival, attended by more than 1,000 political and religious
leaders from around the world, Gorbachev also backed suggestions
for the formation of an international relief agency to respond to
ecological disasters.
   He dubbed it ``the Green Cross,'' in an obvious reference to the
Red Cross.
   Noting that his own country's environment has suffered greatly
from thoughtless decisions, Gorbachev suggested international
technical cooperation in preventing and repairing ecological
damage. He added that he is prepared to allow inspections on Soviet
territory to avoid any suspicion that high technology is being
diverted to other uses.
   The Soviet Union has only begun to recognize its own
environmental problems in recent years, since Gorbachev's policy of
glasnost, or openness, permitted public criticism of bureaucratic
decisions.
   The Soviet environmental movement expanded dramatically after
the Chernobyl nuclear power plant explosion, which devastated a
large area of the Ukraine and Byelorussia.
   Gorbachev drew sustained applause from his audience in the Grand
Kremlin Palace when he repeated the Soviet Union's long-standing
offer to end nuclear weapons testing if the United States agrees to
follow suit.
   He said the Soviet Union expects to sign an agreement soon
providing for the destruction of tons of chemical weapons, and he
promised that Soviet military maneuvers would be restructured to
reduce environmental damage.
   In the speech, which ended the five-day conference in Moscow, he
called for international environmental monitoring and control. That
is another item of considerable use to the Soviet Union, which has
only recently begun to calculate its pollution levels. The water in
many cities is too fouled to drink and toxic waste dumps are often
open pools of deadly chemicals.
   Gorbachev suggested the development of international standards
to protect areas of particular concern for the entire world, such
as the Antarctic. He mentioned tropical forests, coral reefs and
Lake Baikal in the Soviet Union.
   Focusing on the Soviet Union, he promised to triple the number
of preserves of pristine wilderness in the next decade.
   He also suggested that an environmental conference planned for
Brazil in 1992 be held at ``the highest level'' to approve a code
of ecological ethics.

   Alberto Semprini, a household name in Britain for
30 years as pianist and host of the ``Semprini's Serenade'' radio
program, died Friday at the age of 81.
   Semprini, who died at his home in Brixham, in Devon, suffered
from Alzheimer's disease.
   Semprini, who had an English mother and Italian father,
entertained World War I troops on the piano when he was 8 before
going to Milan to study. He had a distinguished career as a concert
pianist and conductor and was artistic director of the Italian
record company, Fonit, for more than 25 years.
   He was known for his catchphrase, ``Old ones, new ones, loved
ones, neglected ones,'' on his radio show, which ran through the
1950s, 1960s and 1970s.

<HEAD>Woman at Center of Euthanasia Debate Dies After 15 Years in Coma</HEAD>
<DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ineke Stinissen, who was at the
center of a debate on mercy killing in the Netherlands, died Friday
after more than 15 years in a coma. She was 47.
   The cause of death could not immediately be established, Dutch
television reported, but the nursing home in the eastern
Netherlands where she had been fed intravenously since a botched
Caesarean operation in March 1974 had stopped feeding her 11 days
ago.
   Her death marked the end of a more than a decade of campaigning
by her husband, Gerard, for her life to be ended because her coma
apparently was irreversible.
   Earlier this month, the nursing home yielded to a court ruling
allowing the medical staff to end Ms. Stinissen's life. It
previously had refused to do so on ethical grounds.
   Attempts by a fundamentalist Dutch pro-life group to obtain a
court order to keep feeding her had failed earlier this week.
   One of the key questions in the Stinissen case was whether such
a euthanasia decision can be made on behalf of a comatose patient,
since Dutch euthanasia policy and practice is predicated on the
patient's request.
   So-called ``active'' euthanasia has obtained quasi-legal status
in the Netherlands after gradual acceptance of a set of ethical
guidelines. It is estimated that 5,000 Dutch patients die from
mercy killing each year.
   Ms. Stinissen's death came one day after the government
appointed a committee of jurists to draw up recommendations for
definitive legislation on the issue, which has been debated for
nearly a decade.

   Bush administration spokesmen on Friday
applauded the withdrawal of some Soviet warplanes from Cam Ranh Bay
in Vietnam and said Defense Secretary Dick Cheney will discuss
possible responses when he visits U.S. allies in the Far East next
month.
   Cheney plans to travel Feb. 10-23 to Japan, Korea and the
Philippines, three nations where the United States has major bases,
administration officials said.
   The Soviet announcement was not expected to lead to an immediate
cut in U.S. troops in the Far East, according to administration
spokesmen, and they said no decision was likely before April when
the Pentagon is to to complete a study on the issue for Congress.
   U.S. ``force levels in the region are based on the longterm
threat and our force levels are based on a rational analysis of
that threat in the region,'' said a Pentagon spokesman, Lt. Cmdr.
Edward Lundquist.
   ``We continually review our force posture and do so in full
consultation with our allies so that we can determine the
appropriate levels of deployment,'' he said.
   The cut in the number of Soviet Mig-23 ``Flogger'' fighters and
Tu-16 ``Badger'' bombers at Cam Ranh Bay, announced in Moscow on
Thursday, will enhance ``regional stability'' and was part of a
reduction in Soviet operations abroad over the past two years, said
Lundquist.
   ``We welcome that announcement,'' said Lundquist. ``This is part
of their overall reduction of overseas operations,'' and had been
spotted by the Pentagon before the Soviet statement, he said.
   At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said U.S.
officials ``anticipate that less Soviet military involvement in
Southeast Asia would contribute to regional stability and to
efforts to achieve a comprehensive political settlement to the
Cambodian conflict.''
   Last year, the Soviet-backed government of Vietnam withdrew its
occupation force from Cambodia, and an international conference met
in Paris last week seeking a political solution to the Cambodian
civil war.
   The partial withdrawal from Cam Ranh Bay was part of a general
reduction in Soviet forces in Asia and around the globe, announced
at the United Nations in December 1988 by Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev.
   Gorbachev said the Soviet Armed Forces would be cut overall by
10 percent, pulling troops and tanks from Eastern Europe and
withdrawing 50,000 of its 60,000 troops from neighboring Mongolia,
along the Chinese border. Beijing has demanded such a cut as a
condition for improved ties with Moscow.
   Neither the Pentagon nor the Soviet Foreign Ministry disclosed
the number of aircraft withdrawn from Cam Ranh, which was an
American military base before the fall of the U.S.-backed South
Vietnamese government in April 1975.
   ``The number of aircraft they have deployed, and the tempo of
operations at Cam Ranh was less in 1989 than it was in 1988, and
that was less than in 1987,'' said Lundquist.
   In Moscow on Thursday, the Foreign Ministry deputy spokesman
Vadim Perfiliyev said up to 10 aircraft remained at Cam Ranh Bay.
   ``Acting within the framework of the earlier announced measures
to reduce the numerical strength of the Soviet Armed Forces in the
country's eastern section and convert them to a purely defensive
structure in the Asia-Pacific region, the Soviet Union has started
reducing its presence in Cam Ranh Port by arrangement with the
Vietnamese side,'' Perfiliyev said.
   ``Mig-23 and Tu-16 planes were withdrawn from there at the end
of 1989,'' he said. ``A squadron with a varying number of aircraft
(six to 10) remains at the Cam Ranh airfield,'' he said.
   ``The Soviet side hopes that these actions will help to defuse
military-political tension and strengthen the climate of mutual
trust in the Asia-Pacific region,'' he said.
   On Wednesday, Tass quoted Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze as saying that ``the day when there will be no Soviet
military presence in Asia beyond Soviet borders is near.'' He urged
the United States ``correct its policy in that region.''
   As of 1989, Soviet forces at Cam Ranh Bay consisted of 2,800
personnel, six Tu-95 bombers, 16 Tu-16 bombers, one squadron of
Mig-23 fighters and a fleet of surveillance and electronic warfare
aircraft, according to the ``Military Balance 1989-90,'' published
by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, based in
London.
   The Soviets also operate one or two submarines and an
unspecified number of surface vessels out of the Vietnamese port,
according to the institute.
   U.S. forces in the Philippines consist of 600 Army, 9,200 Air
Force and 5,500 Navy personnel, according to the institute.
Additionally, the United States keeps 31,600 Army and 11,600 Air
Force personnel in South Korea and 2,000 Army, 16,500 Air Force and
8,300 Navy personnel in Japan, with smaller deployments in
Australia and Guam.

<TEXT>
   After rightists read in the newspaper that Masaaki
Nakajima was active in a group working for the rights of
foreigners, they drove a military-style truck to his quiet
neighborhood in suburban Tokyo.
   For two days, Nakajima says, men in khaki uniforms harangued his
family and neighbors with the truck's powerful public-address
system, bellowing ``Get out of our motherland. Why don't you
respect our country?''
   Many of Japan's estimated 820 ultra-rightist groups spend their
time driving along city streets in dark-painted trucks blaring
martial music or in harassing perceived opponents like Nakajima,
who also heads the United Church of Christ, Japan's largest
Protestant denomination.
   But some rightist groups, in their quest to protect their vision
of Japanese spiritual and political purity, have been implicated in
violent attacks such as the shooting Thursday of Nagasaki Mayor
Hitoshi Motoshima.
   Motoshima, who was seriously wounded, received death threats
after saying that the late Emperor Hirohito shared responsibility
for Japan's involvement in World War II. The leader of a rightist
group, Kazumi Tajiri, has confessed to the shooting, police said.
   Although the number of ultra-right organizations has grown in
recent years, police estimate the membership to be about 120,000 _
the same as a decade ago. Their ideas are much the same, too:
reverence for the emperor and a ``pure'' Japan, anti-communism,
opposition to leftist unions and liberal opinion, and a willingness
to use violence that recalls the early 20th century when
assassination was a political tool in Japan.
   The groups have little public support, and often instill more
fear than respect. But their high-profile activities have made
their impact considerable.
   Fear of rightist reprisals, along with respect for the imperial
family, has kept the question of Hirohito's wartime responsibility
a largely taboo subject. Attacks on newspaper offices attributed to
rightists, such as the murder of a reporter for the liberal Asahi
Shimbun in 1987, have had a chilling psychological effect on news
reporting.
   ``There should be many opinions allowed about the emperor's war
responsibility,'' said former Nagasaki Vice Mayor Soichi Urabe.
``Although many people are criticizing the violence of the attack
on Mayor Motoshima, most people still aren't considering the more
basic issue.''
   Police say they monitor the rightist groups, but in most cases
have no reason to take action because of the constitutional
guarantee of freedom of expression.
   However, some rightists have been arrested for violating an
anti-noise law imposed in 1988 to protect Parliament and foreign
embassies.
   The National Police Agency also has recommended tighter security
for public figures following Motoshima's shooting, a police
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   A man who answered the telephone Friday at the office of
Tajiri's group, Seikijuku, or The Sane Thinkers' School, asked that
questions about the organization be referred to national police
``because they know all about us. Their information is generally
correct.''
   A local police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the group has about 30 members in Nagasaki and a record of
violence and arrests.
   The group was active in the intimidation campaign against
Motoshima that began after the mayor said in December 1988 that
Hirohito, then dying of cancer, ``shares responsibility for the
war, as well as all of us who lived in that period.''
   A year earlier, Tajiri said in a TV interview that he was
willing to kill for his beliefs ``because after all, right-wingers
are terrorists.''
   The rightists also have targeted conservative politicians and
groups.
   Last year, a rightist group reportedly sent a severed finger to
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu to protest government debate over
funding for imperial ascension ceremonies scheduled later this year.
   In 1988 a rightist group claimed responsibility for a shotgun
attack on the home of the founder of the Recruit Co., a
conglomerate at the center of a stock-trading scandal that rocked
the governing Liberal Democratic Party.
   Rightist groups around the country are thought to have links
through which they coordinate policy and activities _ for example,
their decision to halt most public activities during Hirohito's
long illness as a sign of respect, and the gathering of dozens of
sound trucks from around the country in Nagasaki to protest
Motoshima's remarks.
   Rightist groups also are generally thought to be funded by
underworld ``yakuza'' gangs and to receive guns from them, but the
connections remain murky.
   Many rightists advocate a return to the prewar imperial system,
in which the emperor was considered the nation's divine spiritual
leader and power was highly centralized.
   They also want to revise the postwar constitution, especially
Article 9, which renounces war and the use of force to settle
international disputes.
   Despite their use of the emperor as a symbol, many rightist
groups are not enthusiastic about current Emperor Akihito, whom
they see as too unimperial and a product of modern democratic
society, observers say. In a shock for the rightists, Akihito also
pledged when he became emperor to uphold the Constitution.
   In contrast, the imperial system has been a focus of attacks by
Japan's leftist extremists. Officials say they plan to mobilize
about 32,000 police to guard the imperial ascension ceremonies from
possible leftist attack this fall.

   Rusty Hamer, the child actor in Danny
Thomas' popular 1950s and '60s television series ``Make Room for
Daddy,'' has died of an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound. He
was 42.
   ``He hasn't really been happy since his early 20s,'' said
Hamer's brother, John. ``But he didn't show any signs of this
happening. It was just all of a sudden.''
   Hamer said his brother suffered debilitating back pain but
refused to see a doctor.
   He apparently shot himself in the head Wednesday with a
.357-caliber revolver, said Chief Detective Robert McCullough of
the Beauregard Parish Sheriff's Office.
   Thomas, reached by telephone Friday at his home in Los Angeles,
said he and Hamer had ``a marvelous association.''
   ``I raised him. I got him when he was about 5{ years old on the
TV show. His real father passed away not too long after that. I
remember him saying to me, crying, `You're the only daddy I have
left now.'
   ``There is no question in my mind he was the best boy actor in
comedy I ever met in my life.''
   Thomas said they kept in touch for a while after the show ended
but lost touch after he moved to Louisiana.
   John Hamer found his brother's body Thursday night in the
trailer where he lived near DeRidder, about 40 miles north of Lake
Charles in southwestern Louisiana.
   On the TV series, which ran from 1953 to 1964, Rusty Hamer
played the precocious child Rusty. Danny Thomas played his father,
a nightclub singer and comedian. Marjorie Lord played Thomas'
second wife, Kathy, and Angela Cartwright played her daughter,
Linda.
   It was one of television's most durable and popular situation
comedies. Most of the cast, including Hamer, returned in 1970-71
with a sequel sitcom, ``Make Room For Granddaddy,'' in which Rusty
was a married medical student. It lasted one season.
   Rusty Hamer got his first film role at the age of 5, appeared in
several Abbot and Costello films, and has a star on Hollywood's
Walk of Fame, his brother said.
   At age 20 Hamer was working for a Los Angeles messenger service
and was bitter and depressed, his brother said. After moving to
southwest Louisiana, his jobs included delivering a newspaper,
working offshore for Exxon, and occasional work at his brother's
restaurant.
   John Hamer, 47, said he began acting before Rusty but left
Hollywood when he was 17.
   ``I did not enjoy the industry. I felt the people in it _ the
majority were confused in their own lives,'' he said.
   John Hamer said he had moved to DeRidder to open a cafe and
Rusty moved there in 1976 to be near their mother, who had moved in
with John. He said he thought their mother's ill health took a toll
on his brother.
   The only survivors are his brother and their mother, Dorothy
Hamer, who suffers from Alzheimer's disease and is in a nursing
home. He will be cremated without services, according to Colonial
Funeral Home in DeRidder.

<HEAD>USDA Muffled Conclusions of WIC Report, GAO Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A revision of an Agriculture Department study
unjustifiably played down the benefits of a popular $1.93 billion
nutrition program designed to help poor women and children,
according to a report to Congress released Friday.
   The General Accounting Office, the investigating arm of
Congress, said department reviewers who evaluated research on the
so-called WIC program ``deleted the original chapter and executive
summaries'' because those reviewers believed the deleted material
portrayed the program ``more favorably than justified by the data.''
   WIC, which stands for Women, Infants and Children, provides food
to pregnant women and new mothers. A congressional committee plans
to hold hearings on the GAO report next week.
   Results of the six-year $5.9 million analysis were released in
1986 and ``almost immediately'' raised questions, the GAO report
said.
   According to the GA0, the department's compendium of results
from the study, substituted for the original summaries, ``contains
errors and misleading statements about some of the data and deletes
the study team's overall conclusions regarding the WIC program's
impact on participants.''
   It added: ``In contrast, the original executive summary used
appropriate methodology, was accurately presented, and reported the
study's main conclusions: that WIC improves the diet of pregnant
women and children, adds to maternal weight gain, increases the use
of prenatal care, and reduces preterm deliveries.''
   In comments included in the GAO report, the department said it
``agrees with GAO's technical criticism'' of the compendium of
results, and agrees with criticisms of the delays in publishing the
report.
   ``However, the intent of this document was not to understate the
results nor to mislead the reader in any way,'' said Ann Chadwick,
acting assistant secretary for food and consumer services. ``It was
written out of a genuine concern that the summary submitted by the
contractor did not accurately characterize the results of (the
study).''
   The WIC program began in 1972 and provides food supplements and
nutrition education to low-income pregnant and breast-feeding
mothers and children up to five years old. An average of about 3.4
million people were enrolled in the program in the fiscal year that
ended Sept. 30.
   Food packages contain such items as infant formula, milk or milk
products, iron-fortified cereal, juice, eggs and dried beans or
peanut butter. The packages are supposed to supplement other food
sources like food stamps or welfare programs.
   According to GAO, the objective of the evaluation that began in
1979 was to ``provide a reliable estimate of the effects of
participation in the WIC program on nutrition and health during
pregnancy and early childhood.''
   The report said that a 1987 Agriculture Department study showed
about 10 million people could be eligible for WIC benefits, based
on income. And that study used 1984 data, it said.
   Thus, some members of Congress, including those who would like
to see the WIC program expanded, were interested in the evaluation
report to help make further decisions on the future of the program.
   The GAO report has top billing at a joint hearing on Jan. 24 of
the House Select Committee on Hunger, headed by Rep. Tony P. Hall,
D-Ohio, and the Senate Agriculture Committee, headed by Sen.
Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.
   In a terse statement issued Friday, Leahy said, ``The
allegations made in the GAO report are very troubling. I plan to
get to the bottom of this at the hearing next week.''

   Federal engineers are stepping up their probe
of possible automatic torso belt failures in the Ford Escort and
Mercury Lynx that consumers have blamed for five deaths and 76
injuries, the government said Friday.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it was
upgrading its investigation from a preliminary evaluation,
involving mostly paperwork, to an engineering analysis in which
engineers will study the components involved.
   ``We've received numerous reports which allege malfunction or
failure of the passive restraint system,'' agency spokesman Tim
Hurd said. ``Additional reports allege the passive restraint system
failed to restrain or adequately protect the occupant during an
accident.''
   The investigation involves the 1987, 1988 and 1989 Escort and
the 1987 Lynx, Ford Motor Co. spokeswoman Linda Becker said. An
estimated 1,029,312 are on the road. The Lynx, a clone of Escort
sold under the Mercury name, was discontinued after 1987.
   The agency and Ford have received 316 complaints between them,
blaming the belts for five deaths and 76 injuries resulting from
accidents, Hurd said.
   Ford is cooperating with the investigation and company engineers
are inspecting the models in question, Ms. Becker said.
   ``We have found no evidence that any systematic defect is
involved,'' she said. ``It appears the passive belt systems have
performed as designed.''
   The cars have manual lap belts in addition to the automatic
torso belts being investigated, she said.
   The agency also announced new preliminary evaluations of:
   _Cruise controls that fail to disengage in the 1983 and 1984
Toyota Camry, the subject of four complaints in the United States
and three in Canada.
   _Reports of malfunctioning warning lights in the 1987-90 Camry
designed to notify passengers when the passive safety belt system
has been disengaged. There have been three complaints blaming the
problem for three accidents and five injuries.
   _Fires and smoke in 1983-88 Ford light pickup trucks caused by
dried leaves and debris entering the heating and air conditioning
systems. Three fires and six instances of smoke have been reported,
and 1.7 million of the trucks are on the road.
   _Six reports of gasoline leaks in the Volkswagen Vanagon models
with supplementary gasoline heaters.
   _Thirteen reports of cruise control problems in 1984-88 GMC
Suburban vans.
   _Eight complaints of power steering loss in the 1987-88
Chevrolet Astro and Safari minivans.
   The agency said it had discontinued three preliminary
evaluations after finding no widespread defects. The investigations
were of safety belt retractor failures in Chrysler Corp.'s 1988
Jeep Cherokee, Wrangler and Wagoneer; under-dashboard fires in the
1987 Porsche 924 and 944 and transmission oil line fires in the
1988-89 Ford Probe.
   An investigation of transmission oil line fires in the 1988-89
Mazda MX6 was halted after engineers found the problem posed no
unreasonable risk.

   Myles F. Horton, a major influence on a
generation of civil rights leaders who founded a school that led
the movement to franchise blacks, died Friday of cancer. He was 84.
   Horton, a self-described ``radical hillbilly,'' saw literacy as
a key to breaking racial barriers and envisioned a new South long
before others thought it possible.
   In 1932, Horton helped found the Highlander Folk School near
Chattanooga. Often called the backbone of the civil rights
movement, the school educated impoverished southern workers, labor
union leaders and civil rights activists.
   Martin Luther King Jr., Ralph Abernathy, Eleanor Roosevelt, Rosa
Parks, John L. Lewis and Andrew Young were influenced by Horton and
supported his endeavors.
   ``Myles Horton was one of those suffering servants who had a
vision of justice in the South long before it was deemed
possible,'' Young said earlier this week.
   John Gaventa, director of the Highlander Research and Education
Center, as the school is now called, said Horton died surrounded by
friends and family at his home on the school's campus, 20 miles
east of Knoxville, Tenn.
   Horton had been fighting cancer for 2{ years and last month was
diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor. He slipped into a deep
coma Jan. 13.
   A group of Highlander associates started the first Citizenship
School in the Sea Islands off South Carolina, the forerunner of
other schools that taught poor blacks to read so they could pass
literacy tests and vote.
   In the 1930s, Highlander was a training school for the Congress
of Industrial Organizations, or the CIO, and supported coal miners,
farmers and textile workers organize unions in the Depression Era.
   Highlander was one of the few places in the South where blacks
and whites could meet and discuss social change. It was closely
allied with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and Martin
Luther King.
   Mrs. Roosevelt defended Highlander when McCarthyites attacked
the school in the 1950s as a training center and safe haven for
Communists.
   The state of Tennessee shut down Highlander in 1959, saying
interracial gatherings and alleged liquor sales at the school
violated the school's charter. Highlander was auctioned in 1961,
but started again a decade later.
   Horton received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the American
Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee in 1989; the Martin Luther King
Jr. Award from the Fellowship of Reconciliation, a religious group;
the Rothko Chapel Award for Commitment to Truth and Freedom in
1986; and the Literacy Education Award from the International
Council of Adult Education in Paris in 1982, among other honors.
   The son of a sharecropper, Horton was born July 9, 1905 in
Savannah, Tenn. He attended Cumberland University in Tennessee,
Union Theological Seminary in New York, and then the University of
Chicago.
   Horton married Zilphia Johnson Horton in 1935 and both directed
programs at the school. After her death, in 1961 he married Aimee
Isgrig, but the couple later separated.
   He is survived by Charis Horton, 44, a Los Angeles filmmaker,
and Thorsten Horton, 46, a Wisconsin college professor.

   President Bush on Friday issued an election-year
call for lower taxes and interest rates, saying he's not satisfied
with home mortgage rates hovering around 10 percent.
   ``We cannot allow the high costs of housing to suffocate the
financial life of America's young people. And when it comes to
housing, this must not become a society of `haves' and `have
nots,''' the president said on the eve of the first anniversary of
his inauguration.
   ``The 1990s must be another decade of lower taxes and lower
interest rates.''
   Bush spoke at the National Association of Home Builders
convention in Atlanta before flying to Miami to campaign for the
re-election of Republican Gov. Bob Martinez.
   The homebuilders are experiencing hard times, with housing
construction slumping last year to its lowest level since the 1982
recession.
   Bush said mortgage rates have fallen from 18 percent in the
early 1980s to less than 10 percent.
   ``I want to see them come down even more. ... I am not satisfied
at 10 percent,'' Bush said, winning cheers from the audience of
thousands of people in Atlanta's cavernous Omni Coliseum.
   His remarks added direct pressure to a White House call a day
earlier for the Federal Reserve to ease credit further.
   Bush also prodded Congress to adopt fiscal policies ``as sound
as those of the average American household.'' He said any money
saved from lower Pentagon spending should be used to reduce the
deficit instead of for new spending.
   In Washington, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine,
said Friday that he hasn't decided whether to endorse Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan's proposal to roll back Social Security taxes, but
criticized Bush for rejecting it out of hand.
   Mitchell credited Moynihan, a New York Democrat, with stating
``in very stark terms the administration's tax policy, which is,
`Let's cut taxes for the wealthy, but not the working people.'''
   Bush on Thursday called the Moynihan proposal a ``charade'' and
Vice President Dan Quayle said it was ``a political trap'' and ``a
subterfuge for a general tax increase.''
   Riding into Atlanta from the airport, Bush's armored Cadillac
limousine billowed white smoke from under the hood because of an
unexplained mechanical failure. One aide said there had been a drop
in oil pressure.
   The motorcade stopped on Interstate 75 for about two minutes
while Bush switched into a backup car.

   Later, in remarks prepared for a Martinez fund-raiser in Miami,
Bush noted changes around the world with democratic reforms in
Eastern Europe and the removal of Manuel Antonio Noriega from power
in Panama.
   ``In fact,'' Bush said, ``there are only two holdouts preventing
a totally democratic hemisphere. So let Daniel Ortega (president of
Nicaragua) and Fidel Castro (president of Cuba) take note: Like the
dinosaur, the day of the dictator is over.''

   Bush toured a section of Everglades National Park not far from
Miami, walking along wooden pathways and bridges, watching
alligators and discussing wildlife and the environment with
youngsters from Sunset Elementary School who accompanied him.
   As a crow cawed loudly, the president sat on a stone wall,
alligators swimming in the swampy waters behind him, and listened
to a 20-minute lecture on the fragile Everglades ecosystem from a
national park ranger.
   ``As the world gets smaller, we have to preserve our environment
and protect it,'' Bush said. But ``you can't stop everything from
growing so you need sound management.''
   In Atlanta, Bush spoke at the same coliseum where Democrats held
their 1988 convention and nominated Michael Dukakis to run against
him.
   Bush told the homebuilders that low and stable interest rates
are vital for home-builders and home-buyers alike.
   ``A 1 percent increase in the interest rate knocks millions of
families out of the market,'' he said, adding that the best housing
policy is ``a healthy, growing economy with low, long-term interest
rates.''
   The Bush White House has been reluctant to criticize the Federal
Reserve, but began expressing concern Thursday amid signs the
central bank would not support a further easing of credit.
   After driving rates higher since early 1987, the Fed reversed
course in June. Since then, the federal funds rate, controlled
directly by the Fed, has fallen about 1.5 percentage points, to
about 8.25 percent.
   The federal funds rate is the rate banks charge one another for
overnight loans.
   Bush used his appearances to make another pitch for
congressional approval of a cut in capital gains taxes. He said he
wanted an up-or-down vote on the issue soon after the Congress
reconvenes Jan. 23.
   The president also noted a planned march by white supremacist
Richard Barrett on Saturday near Atlanta's Martin Luther King
center.
   ``Atlanta is a great and cheerful city. It has proudly risen
from the ashes of a distant past,'' Bush said. ``And for those who
plan to revel in a rally of hate here tomorrow, let them know this:
Atlantans, like all Americans, turn their backs on bigots.''

<HEAD>Japan to Reopen Talks on Aid to China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan and China agreed Friday to resume talks on
a major Japanese loan package that were suspended after China's
military crackdown on pro-democracy dissent.
   Koichi Matsuura, director general of the Japanese Foreign
Ministry's Economic Cooperation Bureau, said a final decision on
the loan package will be reached after the two sides exchange data
on the contents of the economic assistance, Japanese sources said.
   Matsuura met Thursday and Friday with Foreign Economic Relations
and Trade Vice Minister Shen Jueren. He also held talks Zhu Lilan,
vice minister of the State Science and Technology Commission.
   Matsuura's visit follows the lifting of martial law in Beijing
last week, a move aimed at easing tensions with the United States
and other countries and persuading the West to end sanctions on
badly needed soft loans for development projects.
   The United State responded to the lifting of martial law by
saying it would support new World Bank loans for humanitarian
purposes. Japan also welcomed the end of martial law, but said it
wanted to see further efforts by China before it revives its
economic aid programs.
   The sources said no specific time has been set for further talks
on the $5.6 billion loan package Japan has pledged to provide for
some 40 development projects in the 1991-95 period.
   They said Matsuura told the Chinese that the lifting of martial
law was a positive step and that Japan hopes to see China continue
its policies of economic reform and opening to the outside world.
   He said there has been no change in Japan's intention to help
China's modernization process through grants, government loans and
technical cooperation.
   The Chinese side expressed its appreciation for Japan's
fulfilling its loan commitment of $3.2 billion for the five-year
period ending in March.
   Japan, like other Western nations, after the military crackdown
on the democracy movement in June 1989 suspended negotiations on
new loans while going ahead with credit already pledged.
   A Japanese Embassy official said Matsuura's visit was for
``preliminary discussions'' on a variety of credit and grant
programs Japan has with China and would not mean an immediate
resumption of talks on the five-year package.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu has said he hopes a final agreement
on the loans can be reached by April as originally scheduled.

   The Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh said his
showcase of communal living in Oregon would set an example for the
world, but at his death Friday his commune was vacant and unwanted,
his followers scattered, his memory reviled.
   Rajneesh came to Oregon in 1981. By the time he was thrown out
of the country in 1985, authorities were calling him the most
notorious figure in Oregon history.
   ``He was both a charlatan and a very evil person,'' said Vic
Atiyeh, the governor during the guru's years in Oregon. ``Evil in
the sense of the kind of people he gathered around him and what he
allowed them to do, and his own personal arrogance. He was above
everything.''
   U.S. Attorney Charles Turner, who prosecuted the guru on
immigration fraud charges, said the 400 sham marriages among
Rajneesh's disciples that led to the immigration charges, the
poisoning of 750 people at restaurant salad bars and the commune's
vast electronic eavesdropping network were the largest cases of
their kind in American history.
   ``The legacy of crime that this man left here is unparalleled in
American jurisprudence,'' Turner said.
   The bejeweled guru brought his gospel of meditation and free
love to the United States on the pretense of obtaining treatment
for a bad back. He never underwent that surgery, but moved to a
64,000-acre ranch his followers had purchased in the remote high
desert of central Oregon.
   Their stated intent was to farm the land on Rancho Rajneesh, but
they built homes, a hotel, restaurants, shops, an airport and a
meditation hall, and then incorporated as the town of Rajneeshpuram.
   After it all fell apart, an insurance company foreclosed on
Rancho Rajneesh, but has been unable to find a buyer.
   At its height, some 4,000 red-clad disciples lived at the
commune. The gathering swelled to 15,000 when followers from around
the world came for summer festivals.
   Between morning and evening meditation sessions with Rajneesh,
disciples toiled 12 hours a day. In the early afternoon, they would
stop work and line the dusty roads for the guru's daily
``drive-by'' in one of his more than 90 Rolls-Royces. Singing and
swaying, the disciples tossed roses onto the car's hood while armed
guards hovered overhead in a helicopter.
   Sect members won political control of the nearby community of
Antelope, renaming it City of Rajneesh, and attempted to control
voting in Wasco County by busing thousands of homeless people to
the commune in 1984. After state officials ordered eligibility
hearings for all new voter registration applicants in the county,
the Rajneeshees and their transient guests boycotted the election.
   ``At the time we were going through it, we didn't realize how
extraordinary it was,'' said Norma Paulus, who was secretary of
state at the time. ``I can't think of any comparable incidents in
American history.''
   Rajneesh's acid-tongued secretary, Ma Anand Sheela, was a
fixture in the state's media as she accused anyone who opposed the
commune of bigotry.
   Lawsuits were filed by and against the Rajneeshees on issues
ranging from slander to the constitutionality of Rajneeshpuram's
incorporation.
   Rajneeshee-loathing spread throughout the state. Caps bearing
the guru's likeness inside a rifle target were hot items.
   In September 1985, Sheela and about a dozen disciples left the
commune abruptly. Rajneesh made accusations against her that
triggered federal, state and local criminal investigations.
   Rajneesh was arrested the next month during a stopover at
Charlotte, N.C., on a flight to Bermuda. He pleaded guilty to two
counts of immigration fraud and returned to India under an
agreement with federal officials.
   Sheela, now 39, was arrested in West Germany and returned to
Oregon, where she pleaded guilty to charges that included the
attempted murder of the guru's physician with a poison-filled
syringe.
   She also admitted poisoning several county officials and
masterminding the salad poisonings at restaurants in The Dalles,
the county seat.
   She pleaded guilty to creating an electronic eavesdropping
system at the commune and to setting fire to the county planning
office. A guilty plea to immigration fraud stemmed from charges
that she helped arrange sham marriages to allow Rajneesh's foreign
disciples to remain in the United States.
   Sheela, a native of India, was deported in December 1988 after
serving 2{ years in federal prison.
   Rajneeshees say about 200 of the guru's followers remain in
Oregon, but keep a low profile.
   Attorney General Frohnmayer says the Rajneeshee episode resulted
in the clarification of state laws in several areas.
   ``We learned from it,'' he said. ``It would be harder for a
group bent on breaking the laws of civil government to move in to
Oregon now.''

   Aid to Panama is being delayed up to 45 days
in some cases because of ``inappropriate intrusions'' by Congress
into administration affairs, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said
Friday.
   Thornburgh, addressing an annual meeting of the Federalist
Society, said the lawmakers are ``increasingly attempting to
micromanage the executive branch on matters such as foreign
affairs, routine executive branch operations and even internal
deliberations.''
   ``Even today, the president's flexibility to act with dispatch
to help our friends in Panama is hampered and delayed by ...
congressional caveats,'' the attorney general said.
   ``They were impetuously passed to stop any foreign aid, or
military support, or tariff relief from ever going to General
Manuel Noriega. Now Noriega is in a Miami jail _ because of prompt
executive action _ but these `regs' are still on the books,
blocking help to Panama, in some cases, for 45 days.''
   ``Such provisions constitute clearly inappropriate intrusions by
Congress into executive branch management,'' Thornburgh said.
   ``I have grave doubts ... that the power of the purse was ever
intended to include the power to define our foreign relations ....
and to require that Congress be notified of all covert activities
within 48 hours, even if doing so could threaten American lives,''
said the attorney general.
   He also expressed concern about ``Congress' growing penchant for
delegating executive power to persons not controlled by the
president, and cited the Independent Counsel act as an example.
   ``I broach this subject briefly not to impugn any past or
present independent counsel, but to point out, forthrightly,
present difficulties and potential dangers that arise, even from
the best of intentions, when the separation of powers is ignored,
or, as in this case, is legislatively `gotten round','' he said.
   ``Today's overstepping by the legislative branch does not yet
threaten individual liberty,'' Thornburgh said. ``But it does
unnecessarily challenge this administration's commitment to a less
adversarial relationship between the co-equal branches of
government.''
   The Federalist Society is named after the Federalist Papers, in
which Alexander Hamilton, James Madison and John Jay urged adoption
of the Constitution. It was founded in 1981 by three Yale and
University of Chicago law students to counter what they saw as a
liberal bias on law school campuses.

<HEAD>Cranston Blames Federal Regulator for Uninsured S&amp;L Losses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Alan Cranston, fighting low approval
ratings because of his involvement with Lincoln Savings and Loan,
said Friday a former banking regulator was to blame for the sale of
worthless bonds at the failed thrift's offices.
   Continuing an offensive he began early this week, the Senate
majority whip renewed his attack on former chief S&amp;L regulator
Edwin J. Gray as the main culprit in the failure of Lincoln _ and
the losses sustained by bondholders, many of them elderly
Californians who lost their life savings.
   Cranston, D-Calif., released documents in Washington and held
news conferences in California to paint what he called ``a picture
of negligence by Gray and his staff'' when Gray headed the Federal
Home Loan Bank Board.
   One of five senators under investigation by the Senate Ethics
Committee for intervening with regulators on Lincoln's behalf,
Cranston has gone on the offensive this week with five news
conferences in his home state.
   Three separate polls in recent weeks show his popularity with
California voters has plunged to its lowest level ever since he
came to the Senate in 1969.
   The chief document was a chronology by federal regulators. It
showed the bank board permitted Lincoln's parent company, American
Continental Corp., to sell its junk bonds at the bank's offices _
even though regulators questioned the firm's ability to repay
bondholders.
   The bonds, unlike bank accounts at Lincoln, were not insured and
became worthless when American Continental filed for bankruptcy.
   ``It is unforgivable that Gray was permitting the bond sales at
a time when his regulators were raising questions about the
financial state of Lincoln and American Continental,'' Cranston
said in a statement.
   Gray, president of Chase Federal Bank in Miami, was on vacation
and not available for comment, his office said. He headed the bank
board, the former name of the thrift regulation agency, from 1983
to June 1987.
   State and federal officials have said previously that some
22,000 people, mostly Los Angeles-area retirees, were targeted by
Lincoln to switch nearly $200 million of federally insured deposits
into the uninsured junk bonds after federal examiners first
recommended closing the Irvine, Calif. thrift in May 1987.
   Cranston and four Senate colleagues received a combined $1.3
million for their campaigns and causes from Charles H. Keating Jr.,
who was Lincoln's owner until the federal government seized the
thrift last April.
   The $2 billion-plus cost for protecting depositors with insured
accounts _ not the bondholders _ is likely to be the most expensive
thrift takeover in history. The other senators are Dennis
DeConcini, D-Ariz., John McCain, R-Ariz., John Glenn, D-Ohio and
Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich.
   By focusing on the bondholders, Cranston tried to disarm one of
the most personally damaging allegations against him _ bondholders'
testimony that his intervention for Keating made him partly
responsible for their losses.
   Donations of $974,000 went to Cranston's campaign or to voter
registration projects and other political causes headed by members
of Cranston's family.
   Speaking in California, Cranston said, ``I'm taking this step by
step,'' saying that ``One way (to help the bondholders) is to enact
legislation to waive immunity and allow them to sue the federal
government as they can the state.''
   The key document released by Cranston was a chronology by the
Office of Thrift Supervision of events surrounding the bond sales.
   The document showed that early in 1987, Gray's regulators raised
serious questions about American Continental's financial condition
and its ability to pay bondholders.
   An internal bank board memo of Feb. 13, 1987, for instance,
``concludes that ACC may not have the ability to service the debt
in the long term,'' the chronology said.
   The regulators did not force the end of the bond sales until
Dec. 30, 1988, according to the chronology.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has bought an additional
498,500 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices for delivery
in March under a long-term grain supply agreement, the Agriculture
Department said Friday.
   F. Paul Dickerson, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said the wheat was sold by five
companies, which will receive subsidies under the department's
Export Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   Dickerson said only 12,950 tons of wheat remain in the Soviet
Union's current EEP allocation of 2 million tons announced Dec. 19.
Only wheat has been approved for sale to the Soviets under the
price-subsidy program.
   Although no new allocation has been made, the depletion of
existing EEP authority raises the possibility that a new one may be
in the works, depending on Soviet needs.
   The seventh year of the U.S.-Soviet grain agreement began Oct.
1. With the latest sales, the Soviet Union has bought more than 2.7
million tons of wheat for 1989-90 delivery and more than 11 million
tons of corn, plus some soybeans and soybean meal. All of the wheat
was sold under EEP arrangements.
   In 1988-89, the sixth year of the agreement, the Soviet Union
bought about 5.4 million tons of wheat and more than 16.3 million
tons of corn, plus soybeans, soybean meal and grain sorghums. All
but about 700,000 tons of the wheat was bought under EEP.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. The 498,500 tons are equal to 18.3 million bushels worth
around $69 million at recent U.S. farm prices.
   Dickerson reported the subsidies at an average of $17.58 per
ton, or about 48 cents per bushel.
   The EEP arrangement allows private exporters to sell wheat and
other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced
prices to meet foreign competition.

   Vice President Dan Quayle, meeting resistance
in his bid to visit some Latin American countries, will hold
bilateral talks with six heads of state when he goes to Honduras
later this month for the inauguration of that country's president,
his office said Friday.
   On a stop in Panama, the vice president Quayle will discuss the
possibility of U.S. aid to repair the invasion-torn nation, said
Quayle press secretary David Beckwith.
   In Tegucigalpa, Quayle has scheduled meeting with the presidents
of Venezuela, El Salvador, Belize, Costa Rica and Guatemala, as
well as with the new president of Honduras, Rafael Callejas.
   Those discussions most likely will accomplish what President
Bush had in mind when he assigned Quayle to visit the region to
soothe Latin objections to the U.S. military invasion of Panama,
Beckwith said.
   ``If the consultations are accomplished, it reduces the
urgency'' of visiting those countries personally, Beckwith said.
``It will fulfill the mission.''
   The talks give the leaders of the Latin nations an opportunity
to meet with Quayle without receiving him in their own countries.
   Many Latin leaders have voiced objections to receiving Quayle so
soon after the Dec. 20 invasion of Panama, particularly with U.S.
invasion troops still in the country.
   Administration officials acknowledge that they were troubled by
the reaction from the Latin American nations. Officials said that
while none of the leaders refused to speak to Quayle, they let it
be known that this was not the best time for an American vice
president to visit.
   Quayle's trip to the Jan. 27 inauguration includes a subsequent
stop in Jamaica, as well as Panama.
   No figures have been announced on how much money the United
States can provide from its already strapped budget to help Panama
rebuild, but Quayle ``will be talking to them about what's
needed,'' Beckwith said.
   ``I'm sure he'll be able to give them an indication of what
might be feasible.''
   Beckwith quoted Quayle as saying that ``the topic of helping
democracy take root and rebuilding Panama is at the top of the
immediate foreign policy agenda.''
   Other administration officials have said an aid package might
include assistance to businesses, building or permanent housing for
the displaced.
   Quayle also will lend moral support to the U.S.-installed
government of Guillermo Endara, one of the very points that rankles
many Latins.
   Endara should have to face elections or be appointed by the
congress instead of holding power by installation of the U.S.
military, they say. Endara, by the account of independent observer
groups, won the May election that was invalidated by dictator Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Quayle says one objective of his trip will be to urge
recognition of Endara by the Latin countries.
   In Jamaica, he will consult with President Michael Manley.
Although Jamaica voted with the overwhelming majority in the
Organization of American States to deplore the invasion of Panama,
the Caribbean nation has other matters to discuss with Quayle, said
one official.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Jamaica
bucked the regional trend and welcomed Quayle because Kingston
feels ``the United States should not be held hostage to the action
the United States took'' in Panama.
   Bush announced Jan. 5 that he would send Quayle to Latin America
to make explanations about the invasion, which deeply offended even
countries friendly to the United States. They saw it as a
heavy-handed invasion of Panamanian sovereignty.

<HEAD>Lockheed Officials Say Employees May Leave Chad Sunday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARIETTA, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lockheed officials said Friday that three
employees being detained in Chad in a dispute over a company
technical manual they destroyed are expected to leave Sunday.
   Chad officials told the Marietta-based aircraft company Friday
morning that it could make plans for the three technicians to
return home, said Dick Martin, a spokesman at Lockheed's Marietta
plant.
   ``The company is confident the three employees and two wives
will be on a commercial flight to Paris Sunday,'' Martin said.
   The detention was ``due to a misunderstanding'' concerning a
highly technical maintenance instruction manual that the men
believed was not to be handed over to the Chadians at the end of
their one-year maintenance contract, said Len R. Webb, Lockheed's
director for the Middle East and Africa.
   When the men destroyed the multivolume document, they were taken
into custody.
   The technicians, identified as Marvin Gambill, Ernest Ruse and
Irving Thrash, were confined for 10 days in an N'Djamena police
barracks and since Jan. 15 have been kept inside the compound of
the Hotel Tchadienne, the African country's top hotel.
   ``I feel a little as though I were in a cage,'' Ruse said
Friday. ``And the worst of it is that I'm afraid no one will ever
trust us again.''
   Webb said the three men had not been ill-treated or harassed in
any way.
   The three were in Chad because a purchase contract for two
Lockheed C-130 military transport planes called for the three-man
technical team from the Lockheed Aeronautical Systems-Georgia
subsidiary to spend a year there teaching local technicians how to
maintain the planes. The contract ended in December.
   The three men were pledged to silence about the affair by
Lockheed officials while they remained in Chad and authorities
continued to hold their passports.
   Webb said he believed he has resolved the problem by obtaining
an export license for the manual from the U.S. State Department and
getting a new copy of it into the hands of Chadian officials.
   Webb said the three men _ two of them accompanied by their wives
_ would fly from Paris directly to Atlanta.

   Groups trying to make marijuana available for
medical uses such as controlling nausea in cancer patients on
Friday appealed the Drug Enforcement Administration's decision
rejecting the move.
   The DEA acknowledges that marijuana has been used as a drug for
centuries and its therapeutic potential has been noted by doctors
for 150 years.
   But the drug has been illegal in the United States since 1937 _
with only a synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol, THC, the active
ingredient in marijuana, available for medical use. DEA
administrators for 15 years have rejected bids to make marijuana
itself available to patients, most recently last month.
   On Friday, the Drug Policy Foundation, acting as attorney for
the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws and the
Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics, took the case again to the U.S.
Court of Appeals.
   ``This will be the fifth time,'' said Kevin Zeese, counsel and
co-founder of the Drug Policy Foundation who was with NORML from
1980 to 1986. The Drug Policy Foundation advocates treating drug
abuse as a health problem, not a criminal problem.
   ``Each time we've won,'' Zeese said. ``But this is the first
time (the case) is on the issue of whether marijuana has medical
value.''
   Advocates of allowing medical uses of marijuana want the DEA to
change marijuana's status as a Schedule I drug, which is available
only for research, to a Schedule II drug, which would make it
available for patient use.
   Previous court cases have been more on procedural matters, such
as whether the DEA held appropriate hearings before rejecting
applications.
   On Dec. 29, DEA Administrator John C. Lawn rejected a
longstanding petition to reclassify marijuana to Schedule II,
overturning a recommendation by DEA's chief administrative law
judge, Francis L. Young.
   Young called marijuana ``one of the safest therapeutically
active substances known to man'' and ``accepted as capable of
relieving the distress of great numbers of very ill people.''
   Young wrote that ``It would be unreasonable, arbitrary and
capricious'' for DEA to maintain the old classification.
   Lawn wrote that Young had ``failed to act as an impartial judge
in this matter. He appears to have ignored the scientific evidence,
ignored the testimony of highly credible and recognized medical
experts and, instead, relied on the testimony of psychiatrists and
individuals who used marijuana.''
   In addition, Lawn said, Young had ``ignored any evidence
presented by the government.''
   Synthetic THC is available on Schedule II for use as a cancer
chemotherapy antinauseant. Marijuana also has been touted as useful
in the treatment of glaucoma.
   The government provides marijuana for free in some cases in
which the Food and Drug Administration has approved use of the drug
for ``compassionate'' medical purposes. However, medical marijuana
advocates say the process is time-consuming and discourages
physicians from applying for the right to prescribe the drug.
   The FDA said at least two dozen compassionate applications have
been approved since the first in 1976, some covering more than one
patient. Robert Randall of the Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics,
who suffers from glaucoma and was the first to get the FDA's nod,
said he and four others are the only patients who currently have
government approval to use the drug.
   Dr. C. Stratton Hill of the University of Texas' M.D. Anderson
Cancer Center in Houston, said, ``The people I know who have used
(THC) say it's not better than other anti-emetics,'' or antinausea,
antivomiting drugs.
   ``To be effective, you usually have to give it in the dose that
will cause the mind alterations,'' Hill said. ``Most patients who
have cancer don't particularly like that because they're older
folks ... and that's disturbing to them.''
   Hill said the use of marijuana ``is more an emotional issue than
anything else. ... It's so tied up with the psychological makeup of
the person who wants to use it that it's difficult to ferret out
what its use actually is.''
   But Zeese said studies by a half-dozen states comparing
marijuana and the synthetic THC for their antinausea properties
have found ``marijuana's much more effective and much safer as
well.''
   ``With THC, you're taking the pure drug, a much more
mind-altering substance. You see God on that stuff. It's like
tripping,'' Zeese said. ``Marijuana is something the patient can
control. A cancer patient will take two smokes off a marijuana
cigarette and that's all he needs.''
   Zeese said the biggest problem medical marijuana advocates are
likely to face is ``a general rule of law where the Court of
Appeals will usually defer to the head of an agency, considering
the agency is an expert.''
   ``One thing we're going to show is the agency's long-term
bias,'' Zeese said. ``We're also going to have to demonstrate
Lawn's bias as well _ his own, all sorts of political pressures,
pressures from field efforts, his law enforcement background.''
   DEA spokesman Cornelius Dougherty said Lawn's personal
background _ including promises to the wife of slain DEA Agent
Enrique Camarena that Camarena's efforts against Mexican marijuana
traffickers would mean something _ is not important.
   ``The point here is that no one has proven ... that marijuana
does have an accepted medical use, unlike morphine and cocaine,''
which are Schedule II drugs, said Dougherty said.

   The mayor of the District of Columbia and a
drug dealer who said he sold him cocaine both made appearances in
the same federal courthouse Friday. For Mayor Marion Barry, the
legal process was just beginning. For Charles Lewis, it was at an
end.
   ``The purpose of this hearing is to advise you of the charge,''
Magistrate Deborah Robinson told Barry. ``You are not required to
make any statement.''
   The usually loquacious politician remained silent. Until his
trial on a single misdemeanor count of possessing cocaine, he must
undergo drug testing once a week. The mayor was seized in a hotel
Thursday night; the authorities said they had pictures of him
buying crack cocaine from a woman and smoking it.
   Two floors up, Lewis was urged by Judge Stanley Sporkin to speak
out.
   ``It is often hard for others to understand ... how low one can
sink,'' said Lewis. ``How one can be bought by drugs is shown by my
willingness to lie, and not only to lie but to lie to protect the
mayor.''
   Lewis lied, by his own admission, when he denied selling drugs
to Barry in 1988 during at least six visits by the mayor to his
hotel room. Barry said it wasn't so.
   The government placed 16 perjury, conspiracy and cocaine
possession charges against Lewis and he became cooperative. In a
plea bargaining appearance last November, he told Sporkin he bought
crack for Barry three times, either on a street corner or at a
friend's house, and said he then gave the crack to the mayor during
the hotel visits.
   ``I'm not worried at all about this,'' Barry said at the time.
He said a ``convicted felon'' like Lewis ``will say anything in
court ... trying to save his own hide.''
   If that was what Lewis was trying to do, he succeeded.
   In court Friday, the government stood up for him.
   ``He has shown himself to be extremely remorseful, '' said
Assistant U.S. Attorney Judith Retchin.
   She said the prosecution would not object if the judge sentenced
Lewis on the low end of the 15-to-21 month prison span available
under federal guidelines.
   Lewis described ``the contempt I feel for my own actions'' and
promised to rededicate his life to public service.
   ``I will never again fool with the laws of society,'' he said.
   Sporkin said young men with their whole lives ahead of them had
stood before him where Lewis stood and were given sentences of 10
to 15 years.
   He gave Lewis the minimum, 15 months. Subtracting time served,
he is to be released in May.
   ``I was going to give you 18 months, but the government has
impressed me with the extent of your cooperation,'' said the judge.
``You are getting the best break I know.''
   ``I want the word to go out that cooperation is extremely
important,'' he said. ``The only way we are really going to attack
the drug problem is to have people like yourself come forward.''
   When he is released, the judge told him, ``I would like you to
out ... and tell youngsters why they shouldn't do drugs.''
   That is the message that Barry has been delivering when he
speaks to young people.

   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell said
Friday a proposal to roll back Social Security payroll taxes
dramatizes ``the inequity and regressive nature'' of the tax
system, but he declined to endorse it.
   Mitchell said he was concerned about the impact that Sen. Daniel
P. Moynihan's proposal would have on the federal budget deficit and
said he would await two staff studies on this question before
making up his mind.
   But he criticized President Bush for immediately resisting
Moynihan's proposal, saying, ``I regret the manner in which the
president and the White House has treated it.''
   Bush on Thursday called the proposal a ``charade'' and Vice
President Dan Quayle said it was ``a political trap'' and ``a
subterfuge for a general tax increase.''
   ``I call on the Democrat leaders of Congress to give the
American people a break and to let the House and Senate work their
will by having an up-and-down vote on the capital gains tax cut,''
Bush said.
   Discussing issues facing lawmakers with the reconvening of the
second session of the 101st Congress next week, Mitchell used the
Social Security payroll tax issue to attack Bush's tax policies,
particularly the president's quest for a cut in capital gains taxes.
   The Maine Democrat credited Moynihan, a New York Democrat, with
stating ``in very stark terms the administration's tax policy,
which is, `Let's cut taxes for the wealthy, but not the working
people. ... Let the little people pay, cut taxes for the very
wealthy.'''
   ``I think that is a tax policy that is unfair and wrong from a
policy standpoint,'' he said, ``and Senator Moynihan has expressed
it dramatically,'' he said.
   Moynihan, whom Mitchell labeled as ``perhaps the leading expert
in Congress on Social Security,'' wants to roll back the Social
Security payroll tax increase that began Jan. 1.
   Moynihan's proposal would save workers $7 billion in Social
Security taxes this year and $55 billion in fiscal 1991.
   The payroll tax, paid by both employers and employees, rose to
7.65 percent Jan. 1 from 7.51 percent, and it is levied on wages up
to $51,300 instead of $48,000. That means a wage-earner could pay
as much as $3,924 in Social Security taxes this year, an increase
of about $319 from 1989.
   Moynihan argues that the payroll tax should be reduced because
mounting surpluses in the Social Security trust funds are being
used to help offset large budget deficits instead of being put away
for future retirement benefits.
   In a separate session with reporters, Senate Minority Leader Bob
Dole, R-Kan., predicted that Moynihan's plan would
``self-destruct.''
   Dole said the White House will soon offer a proposal of its own
that would force the government to stop using the Social Security
surpluses to reduce the budget deficit.
   Also Friday, a Republican member of the House, Rep. John Porter
of Illinois, introduced his own proposal for preventing use of
surplus Social Security taxes to reduce the federal deficit. He
said that unlike Moynihan's proposal, it would protect retirees
without ``playing tax-cut politics with the Social Security
system.''
   Porter's plan, which is being promoted by House Republican Whip
Newt Gingrich of Georgia, would return the surplus proportionately
to workers whose taxes created it. They would not receive tax cuts
or refunds, however; instead, the money would go into a kind of
Individual Retirement Account and each worker's claim on future
Social Security benefits would drop as the individual account
builds.
   Over a period of 50 years or so, Porter estimated, Social
Security gradually would become a private retirement system. That
would prevent Congress from spending Social Security surpluses,
boost national savings and give workers the potential for higher
retirement benefits than are available under the present system,
Porter said.
   The White House jumped on Moynihan's proposal and the
re-emergence of Sen. Ernest F. Hollings' longtime proposal for a 5
percent value-added tax _ a national sales levy _ as evidence that
Democrats plan to seek a tax increase.
   Hollings, D-S.C., aims to replace revenues lost by the Social
Security tax cut and Bush's own proposal to lower the tax on
capital gains.
   Mitchell said Friday he's against Hollings' tax proposal, saying
``that would add to the regressivity of the tax system.''
   But at the same time, he voiced qualms about the impact that
Moynihan's proposal would have on the budget deficit.
   ``The concern which has been expressed about it by responsible
economists ... is a concern which I share,'' he said. ``I will
await those studies and the opportunity to discuss the matter
personally with Senator Moynihan.''
   ``I must say that his suggestion ... has dramatized and focused
attention on the increasing inequity and regressive nature of the
American tax system,'' Mitchell said.
   He said it demostratees that taxes on the wealthiest people
``have been systematically and dramatically reduced'' in the past
decade while taxes for the middle-class ``have actually risen in
the aggregate.''

   President Bush will address a rally of
abortion foes via telephone Monday, the 17th anniversary of the
Supreme Court legalization of abortion, his press secretary said
Friday.
   Bush will use the same method he did in addressing the
Washington rally last year, speaking over a loudspeaker by
telephone, Marlin Fitzwater said before leaving with the president
on a trip to Atlanta.
   On Friday, Bush issued a proclamation designating Sunday as
``National Sanctity of Human Life Day.''
   ``The prevalence of abortion in America today is a tragedy not
only in terms of human lives lost, but also in terms of the values
we hold dear as a nation,'' Bush said.
   ``We ask all levels of government and all sectors of society to
promote policies to encourage alternatives such as adoption, and to
extend policies that make adopting easier for families who want
children and can provide a loving, supportive home for them,
particularly for children with special needs.''
   Nationwide activism for abortion rights has escalated. Bush has
said in recent remarks on the subject that there is room in the
Republican Party for pro-choice supporters as well as abortion
foes, even though he still opposes abortion except in the cases of
rape, incest or threat to the mother's life.
   That posture has become the GOP answer to growing sentiment,
even among its own ranks, against further restrictions on abortion.
   The Supreme Court last year gave states greater discretion in
restricting abortion, touching off a wave of activism by the
pro-choice supporters to protect abortion rights.
   Fitzwater said he didn't know whether Bush would make a point of
using the inclusion language when he addresses the annual ``March
for Life'' rally, which will be held on the Ellipse behind the
White House.
   Leaders of the anti-abortion movement will meet with Bush's
chief of staff, John Sununu, and other administration officials,
but there are no plans for the president to see them, Fitzwater
said.
   Bush told tens of thousands of demonstrators last year that
abortion on demand is an ``American tragedy.'' He said the landmark
Roe vs. Wade decision ``was wrong and should be overturned.''
   While abortion foes march down Pennsylvania Avenue and hold
their rally, pro-choice groups also will hold activities
commemorating the anniversary.

   If only for a day, the nation's capital had an
afternoon newspaper Friday.
   ``BUSTED'' blared the 2{-inch headline above the lead stories in
a special edition of The Washington Times that chronicled the
arrest of District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry on drug charges.
   Most of the 24-page edition was devoted to Barry's arrest at a
downtown hotel Thursday night by federal agents and city police
officers.
   Not since The Washington Star folded in 1981 had residents of
the Washington area seen a local, afternoon newspaper.
   The ``EXTRA!'' was sold by hawkers outside the rival Washington
Post; the District Building, Washington's city hall; the Vista
International Hotel, where Barry was arrested, and at downtown
subway stations, said Linda Clark, a spokeswoman for the Times, a
morning paper published Monday through Friday.
   The lead stories outlined how Barry was apprehended as part of
an FBI sting operation, contained information concerning Barry's
arraignment at midday on misdemeanor cocaine-possession charges and
had comments from a news conference held by U.S. Attorney Jay B.
Stephens.
   The special edition also contained comments from elementary
school students and other residents of the city along with an
editorial and a column on Barry's arrest.
   Occupying more than one-fourth of the front page was a color
photo of Barry and his wife, Effi, leaving their house from his
arraignment.
   The newspaper called its afternoon edition ``Special Report: The
Barry Crackup.''

   A U.S. magistrate ordered the government Friday not
to destroy any documents confiscated from Manuel Noriega's homes or
offices during the Panama invasion and told prosecutors to turn
over an inventory of the evidence to the defense.
   In an earlier hearing Friday, a federal judge refused to order
government investigators away from defense witnesses in the case of
a Noriega co-defendant, but cautioned both sides to avoid
intimidation.
   The magistrate's ruling came after an emergency motion by
Noriega defense attorney Steven Kollin, who said Assistant U.S.
Attorney Myles Malman had traveled to Panama City to inspect
material seized by U.S. troops.
   The U.S. Attorney's office did not object to the order, but
warned it was uncertain how long a full inventory would take.
   Kollin told U.S. Magistrate William Turnoff that Noriega's case
was peculiar in the annals of criminal justice.
   ``This case is so different. ... It's utterly different,''
Kollin said. ``When in the past has an invasion occurred and
everything in the country was taken?''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Sullivan called the defense
request unrealistic, saying it was almost impossible to determine
which of the documents would affect Noriega's case directly.
   But Kollin responded that the defense wanted everything.
   ``When you're a general in an army, everything is under your
dominion and control,'' he said.
   The magistrate ordered the protection and inventory of the
documents, but cautioned that the defense must give more specific
information on the addresses of Noriega's home in Panama City and
Rio Hato and disclose which offices he occupied in the Panama
defense Forces headquarters and Fort Amador.
   At the request of the defense, the magistrate excused Noriega
from attending the session.
   After the hearing, Sullivan refused to comment on Malman's
reported visit to Panama City.
   The magistrate said the inventory of documents from the house
must be available by Thursday, the day before Noriega's bond
hearing, because the defense contended some evidence from the homes
may bear on that hearing.
   Earlier in U.S. District Court, Judge William Hoeveler refused
to order government investigators away from defense witnesses in
the case of Noriega co-defendant Luis del Cid, alleged to be one of
the former dictator's right-hand men.
   An attorney for del Cid complained to the court that
investigators from the Immigration and Naturalization Service
visited the defendant's wife and two friends soon after the three
testified at a bond hearing Tuesday.
   ``These witnesses declined to go back to court today _ they are
terrified,'' said attorney Samuel Burstyn. ``They are worried about
their immigration status.''
   Del Cid's wife is Panamanian and the other two women are
Nicaraguan refugees.
   According to Burstyn, the agents demanded that the women turn
over all their immigration papers and give information about how
they entered the United States.
   Hoeveler noted that the women _ Tilsa del Cid and Norma and
Eglantina Alvarez _ had offered to take custody of del Cid if he is
freed on bond.
   ``It is important for me to get the full picture of what their
status is,'' Hoeveler said. But he added: ``No investigator for
either side can intimidate witnesses.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Sullivan was unapologetic about
the visit to the three women, saying it was part of a wider
investigation. But he denied an allegation by Burstyn that the INS
agents accused the women of involvement in money-laundering to
frighten them into silence.
   ``The INS did have an ongoing investigation about alien
smuggling which touched on del Cid,'' the prosecutor said. ``We
were seeking information about this family.''
   And even if no such investigation existed, Sullivan said, ``The
government has an absolute right to question witnesses.''
   The acting director of the local Immigration and Naturalization
Services, Richard Smith, said he could not comment on the case
without authorization from Washington.
   After the hearing, Burstyn said he was satisfied with the
judge's action.
   Del Cid, a lieutenant colonel in the Panamanian Defense Force at
the time of his arrest just after the U.S. invasion of Panama,
faces a maximum 70 years imprisonment and $550,000 in fines if
convicted of being a liaison and courier between Noriega and drug
traffickers.
   At the bond hearing, Burstyn read a statement from Noriega
denying del Cid headed Panama's intelligence agency or was a close
aide, as the government had charged.
   Prosecutors later acknowledged he did not head the ``G-2''
intelligence division. But they responded with a photo that showed
Noriega and del Cid with Cuban leader Fidel Castro at a 1984
meeting. The government said that meeting was to smooth out
problems between Noriega and the Medellin drug cartel following a
raid on facilities in Panama they were paying Noriega to protect.

   A convicted drug dealer who testified under
oath that he supplied Mayor Marion Barry with crack cocaine was
sentenced to 15 months in prison Friday after prosecutors praised
his cooperation.
   Charles Lewis, 49, who Barry has described as ``an old friend,''
told U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin ``drugs have ruined my
life'' and said he was the perfect example of ``how one can be
bought by drugs.''
   The investigation of Lewis, who pleaded guilty to two cocaine
conspiracy charges in November, touched off a political firestorm
for the mayor. Coincidentally, Barry appeared in the same
courthouse an hour earlier to face a magistrate on a misdemeanor
charge of possessing drugs.
   Barry was arrested Thursday in a downtown hotel by the FBI,
which charged that he possessed an unspecified quantity of crack
cocaine.
   Lewis has twice testified before the grand jury probing possible
drug activities by the mayor.
   During a plea bargain session in December, Lewis testified that
he had supplied the mayor with crack cocaine and that an unnamed
city official had given Lewis money with which to buy drugs for the
mayor.
   Sporkin said he had come to court prepared to sentence Lewis to
18 months in prison _ halfway in the 15-21 month range of sentences
in federal guidelines.
   ``But the government has impressed me with the extent of your
cooperation,'' Sporkin said. ``You are getting the best break I
know.''
   The judge also said the 15-month sentence would include time
already served, meaning Lewis would be released in May.
   Lewis had originally faced 16 perjury, conspiracy and cocaine
possession charges. In exchange for prosecutors dropping all but
two of those counts, Lewis agreed to cooperate fully with the
government's continuing investigation of his ties to Barry.

<HEAD>Bush Says He Won't Sign Clean Air Bill If It Too Costly</HEAD>

   President Bush called on Congress to approve
clean air legislation Friday, but cautioned he will veto any bill
that is substantially more expensive than the proposal he sent to
Capitol Hill last summer.
   ``I will only sign legislation that balances environmental and
economic progress,'' said the president in a letter to Sen. Bob
Dole, R-Kan., the Senate minority leader.
   Bush, noting that the Senate is planning next week to begin
floor action on a tough air pollution control bill, said the
proposal is twice as costly as the administration proposal and the
one under consideration in the House.
   The cost to industry of toughening the nation's air pollution
controls is expected to be a major subject of debate as the
legislation moves forward in Congress in the coming months.
   Senate Democrats have said in recent days that their bill is not
substantially higher in cost from the Bush proposal, but the
president in his letter to Dole said administration estimates put
its price tag at more than $40 billion a year, compared to $19
billion for the administration proposal.
   At the same time, maintained the president, the Senate bill
``provides little incremental environmental benefit'' over House
and administration versions.
   Environmentalists have maintained the Senate bill is much
stronger and should be enacted.
   The president's letter was made public by Dole several hours
after Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, called for
quick Senate action on clean air legislation, calling it ``a high
priority for me and for the president.''
   Mitchell made no reference to Bush's letter.
   He said he anticipated ``a vigorous'' floor debate on the
legislation over the next few weeks. Mitchell said that if clean
air legislation is not enacted this year the country's leadership
in environmental issues will be ``called into question'' worldwide.
   Clean air bills in both the Senate and House call for a 10
million ton reduction in acid rain pollutants, tighter auto
emission standards, and a requirement that a broad range of
industrial plants and businesses install ``best available
technology'' to capture toxic chemical releases.
   The Senate bill, passed by the Environment and Public Works
Committee last November, however, includes several ``second stage''
provisions that the administration and most of industry oppose as
being too costly.
   One provision would require automakers to meet a second round of
emission curbs beginning in the year 2003, while another would
require industry to comply with a health-based standard on toxic
chemical releases not related to what emission control equipment
might be available.
   Supporters of the legislation have argued that the tougher bill
would not be sustantially more expensive and that industry and
administration cost estimates are exaggerated.
   In his letter to Dole, the president outlined some provisions a
bill must have for him to sign it into law. These include that it
contain no national electricity tax to help pay for acid rain curbs
at the dirtiest electric utilities; that a bill achieve overall
pollution reduction levels he outlined in his proposal, and that
the controls not exceed his administration bill cost estimates by
more than 10 percent.
   In a related development, the American Lung Association said
Friday that the tougher Senate clean air bill with its stronger
auto emissions curbs are needed to reduce air pollution to healthy
levels.
   The group, releasing two studies on the effects of dirty air on
health costs, said current health costs stemming from air pollution
is estimated to be $40 billion to $50 billion a year with about
half of that coming from auto emissions.
   ``Five years ago the high-range estimate ....was $40 billion a
year. Today $40 billion has become the best estimate for mid-range
of the health costs,'' said Fran DuMelle, director of government
relations for the association.

<HEAD>Environmentalists Ask EPA To Block Love Canal Resettlement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environmental advocates asked the
Environmental Protection Agency to turn Love Canal into a research
center rather than permit New York state officials to permit
resettlement of the old neighborhood whose name symbolized toxic
chemical waste.
   A meeting with EPA Administrator William Reilly and other agency
officials took place at the request of Lois Marie Gibbs, head of
the Love Canal Neighborhood Association and executive director of
the Citizen's Clearinghouse for Hazardous Wastes in Arlington, Va.
   The agency and the Bush administration ``would look really
terrible if they agreed to resettle Love Canal,'' Gibbs said after
the meeting.
   Gibbs and the other environmentalists object to a 1988
habitability study which some officials are using to justify plans
to move people back into the neighborhood in Niagara Falls, N.Y.
   ``The concern that we have is that the people are going to come
back, they are going to be told it's habitable with a careful point
being made not to say that it's safe ... which is sort of playing
with words,'' said Jacqueline Warren, an attorney with the Natural
Resources Defense Council who also attended Friday's meeting.
   ``Love Canal's not cleaned up at all,'' Gibbs said. ``It's
contained, and even that's in question.''
   But Peter Slocum, a spokesman for the New York State Health
Department, said the state believes the about two-thirds of the
area is no more contaminated than nearby residential neighborhoods.
He said the environmentalists object to resettling Love Canal
``because they don't want to lose the symbol of Love Canal and feel
that somehow if people are allowed to live there again, the
symbolic value of that tragic mistake will be lost.''
   The canal was used by the Hooker Chemical Co. to dump tons of
chemical wastes in the 1940s. In the 1950s, the canal was covered
and homes and an elementary school were built on top. In the 1970s
that residents began to notice foul smells in their basements and
oily puddles in their yards. Eventually, the federal government
declared the neighborhood a disaster area and evacuated the
residents of 728 houses in a 50-block area.
   Lew Crampton, associate EPA administrator, said the agency would
take the next three weeks to study Gibbs' proposal to establish a
research and development center in the neighborhood.

<HEAD>No Sign of Security Crackdown in Albania, Italian Senator Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Italian senator who was in Albania for three days
this week said Friday he saw no sign of a security crackdown in
that hard-line Communist country.
   Sen. Giulio Orlando's comments contradict reports from the media
in Yugoslavia, which shares a border with the closed country, that
there has been widespread unrest this month in several Albanian
cities.
   Orlando said he spent a day in the capital Tirana, a day in
Shkodra, a city near Yugoslavia's border that according to a
Yugoslav newspaper report on Jan. 11 was wracked with protests, and
a half-day in Berati.
   Albania keeps its borders sealed to most foreign travelers so
assessments by the few who do get in helps evaluate the internal
situation in one of the last countries to follow strict
Stalinist-style Communism.
   ``There was no sign of barricades, no (heavy presence) of
soldiers, no tanks,'' the senator told The Associated Press in a
telephone interview. ``There was the normal presence of soldiers.
Nothing to astonish me. No sign of a state of emergency,'' he said.
   Albania has denounced the reports of unrest and security
crackdowns as ``slanders'' that it blamed on Serbian nationalists
in Yugoslavia.
   Orlando, a Christian Democrat who specializes in foreign
affairs, said the visit was his third to Albania since 1988.
   ``In the southern part, the Greek part, there have been some, it
seems, I won't say revolt, but requests on the part of Greek
Orthodox officials for religious liberty,'' Orlando said.
   In an interview that appeared Friday in Rome's La Repubblica
newspaper, Orlando said the Albanians in Berati were restoring
``three beautiful orthodox churches. Everything was calm there.''
   In the telephone interview, the senator said it was his
impression in talks with foreign ministry and other officials that
the present ``leadership is continuing'' Albania's policy of
political isolation.
   However, he said, ``there's a strong push to modernize the
country technologically'' in a direction that requires a certain
openness.
   Orlando said he urged Albanian authorities to sign the Helsinki
accords on human rights and told them a meeting of Balkan nation
foreign ministers set for October in Tirana would be an opportunity
to discuss increasing freedom.
   ``For the moment, their answer was negative _ to a certain
point. ... I had the impression that (becoming a signatory to
Helsinki) was under consideration ... that the matter was under
reflection.''
   Orlando said he thought the Albanian authorities were open to
the idea of establishing some kind of institution among Balkan
nations to monitor rights of minorities.
   The senator said it appeared that Albanian authorities seemed to
be realizing that the national policy of ``isolation didn't pay.''
   Albanian authorities, he said, expressed resolve to work with
Italy, Greece and Yugoslavia in tackling pollution problems in the
Adriatic Sea.

<HEAD>Baker Asks Greater Freedom in Distributing Money</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, faced
with eliminating foreign aid this year to more than a dozen
friendly nations, sought congressional support Friday to disregard
some legal restrictions on how aid money is distributed.
   Baker met with Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine,
and Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., to see whether lawmakers
might permit some flexibility in the so-called ``earmarks''
Congress imposed on fiscal 1990 foreign aid money.
   Dole said Baker complained that the administration has a list of
some 30 countries to which it wants to give a total of $1.6
billion, but has only $950 million in unearmarked money to hand
out, leaving a $650 million shortfall.
   State Department officials have come up with a series of
scenarios under which some of the earmarked money _ roughly from
$150 million to $250 million _ could be pared from its mandated
recipients and given instead to have-nots such as Bolivia, Jamaica,
Argentina, Peru and countries in the Eastern Caribbean.
   ``Some of these countries, small countries, important countries,
are going to be zeroed out,'' Dole told reporters. ``He asked us if
there's any chance leaders in the House and Senate might go along
with it.''
   State Department officials have been agonizing over the
allocations for this year's foreign aid for weeks. The allocations
were suppose to have been decided last month, but remain up in the
air because of the shortfall.
   Dole said Baker did not want to leave out countries that have
been cooperating with the United States in various foreign policy
areas. ``They feel it's going to send a very bad signal to a lot of
countries if we can't scrape up some dough,'' he said.
   President Bush has the authority under the Foreign Assistance
Act of 1961 to rechannel up to $250 million without regard to
congressional instructions to meet U.S. ``security interests,'' but
the authority is seldom used other than to meet small emergencies.
It has never been used to broadly rewrite the foreign aid bill's
priorities.
   An aide to Mitchell said he had taken the matter under
advisement and planned to consult with Democratic lawmakers who
deal with foreign affairs issues.
   Baker indicated that easing the earmarks would not only soften
this year's money crunch but also set the tone for consideration of
the fiscal 1991 foreign aid budget, when the administration hopes
to further its perennial goal of minimizing congressional
directives in the bill, said a Senate source familiar with the
presentation.
   The idea is similar to a proposal Dole advanced earlier this
week for the 1991 budget, to cut foreign aid 5 percent across the
board to the largest recipients to provide enough money to aid
emerging democracies in Eastern Europe and Panama.

   Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, the Rolls-Royce
guru who turned a central Oregon town into a tumultuous commune of
free love, hedonism, and murder plots before being deported, died
Friday at age 58.
   Rajneesh, who claimed 500,000 followers worldwide, suffered
heart failure, according to a spokesman at Rajneesh's commune in
Poona.
   Disciples celebrated his spirit's release with songs and dance,
then carted the body to a riverside funeral pyre where it was
cremated in the traditional Hindu manner.
   Since December 1988, Rajneesh had used the name Osho Rajneesh,
but in the United States he was known as Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh. He
used the Hindu honorific of ``Bhagwan'' meaning ``god'' that
Rajneesh adopted after he began lecturing on meditation in India in
the 1960s. ``Osho'' is a Buddhist term that means ``on whom the
heavens shower flowers.''
   In 1981, Rajneesh brought his teachings of free sex and
materialism to the scrubby hills near Antelope, Ore., drawing
thousands of slavish disciples whose reward was the guru's daily
``drive-by'' in one of his 93 Rolls-Royces _ many painted
psychedelic colors, and some decorated with peacocks and lacy
curtains.
   To nearby residents, the commune known as Rajneeshpuram was a
monstrous intrusion.
   ``I don't think I ever wish anybody dead, but I wished many
times that he would go back where he belongs,'' said Jean Opray,
the former mayor of Antelope.
   Rajneesh also enraged people in Poona, where he settled after
being expelled from the United States in 1985 as part of a plea
bargain agreement on immigration fraud charges.
   A militant young Hindu tried to stab Rajneesh with a long knife
in Poona in 1980, but the case was dropped when Rajneesh refused to
testify in court.
   ``Thank God he is dead. He was a living nuisance,'' said
Hrushikesh Mulganokar, a retired air force chief who lives near
Rajneesh's commune in Koregaon Park, a fashionable residential
district of the city.
   ``We are extremely relieved that our problems have passed
away,'' said Buchan Das, a secretary of the Koregaon Park
Residents' Association.
   ``We had no personal antipathy towards Rajneesh. We hated what
his presence did to us,'' she said, referring to the open shows of
public affection by commune couples.
   With his long gray beard and hypnotic brown eyes, Rajneesh
peddled enlightenment and preached that sex is fun, materialism is
good, and Jesus was a madman. He claimed to be the world's greatest
lover.
   Rajneesh's mission was to create a new man, ``Zorba the
Buddha,'' who would be a synthesis of Eastern mysticism and Western
pop culture.
   ``Explode! Go totally mad ... Jump up and down shouting the
mantra `Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! ... Each time you land, on the flats of your
feet, let the sound hammer deep into the sex center,'' Rajneesh
said in ``The Orange Book,'' his cult's bible.
   In 1984, he changed his views on free sex and told his disciples
to become celebate or stay with one sexual partner. He proclaimed
that AIDS would kill two-thirds of the world's population.
   ``He was both a charlatan and a very evil person,'' said Vic
Atiyeh, who was Oregon's governor during the years the guru was
there. ``Evil in the sense of the kind of people he gathered around
him and what he allowed them to do, and his own personal arrogance.
He was above everything.''
   U.S. Attorney Charles Turner, who prosecuted Rajneesh on
immigration fraud charges, said: ``The legacy of crime that this
man left here is unparalleled in American jurisprudence.''
   Rajneesh, the eldest of a cloth merchant's 13 children,
established his first commune in Poona in 1974. In 1981, he flew to
the United States where he was to undergo back surgery. The
operation was never performed, and later that year Rajneesh bought
the Big Muddy Ranch about 120 miles east of Portland.
   The commune covered 64,000 acres and was home to 4,000 red-clad
followers who toiled 12-hour days to feed Rajneesh's dream of a
model community and his penchant for expensive cars and jewels. The
crowd swelled to 15,000 during summer festivals.
   Rajneeshpuram was incorporated as a city on part of the commune
in 1982. Disciples also moved into Antelope, a town of 40 people,
eventually holding all its elected offices and changing its name to
City of Rajneesh. The name was changed back to Antelope in 1985 at
Rajneesh's suggestion, as a way to make peace with the angry
Oregonians.
   Rajneesh allowed his gun-wielding personal secretary, Ma Anand
Sheela, to wield dictatorial control over the commune, but Sheela
and several of her top aides fled Rajneeshpuram suddenly in 1985,
accusing Rajneesh of caring more about his wealth than his
disciples.
   Rajneesh responded with allegations that led to a federal
investigation and charges the commune had planned to take over the
county.
   He and Sheela were arrested in 1985, Rajneesh as he allegedly
tried to flee to Bermuda.
   He pleaded guilty to two counts of immigration fraud, stemming
from charges he arranged sham marriages to keep his foreign
disciples in the United States illegally. As part of a plea
bargain, Rajneesh was deported from the United States.
   Several countries refused to let him enter, and he eventually
returned to India in November 1985, denouncing the United States as
a ``monster'' that should be ``hushed up forever.''
   The Oregon commune, which included orchards, a vineyard, a
65-acre vegetable farm, two lakes stocked with fish, and an airport
with a 4,500-foot paved runway, is now deserted. An insurance
company foreclosed on the property but never found a buyer.
   Nearly all the Rolls-Royces were sold, many to a car dealer in
Texas. Most were repainted.
   Sheela pleaded guilty to a variety of charges, including
plotting to kill Rajneesh's physician with a poison-filled syringe,
and orchestrating a food-poisoning outbreak that sickened more than
750 people in The Dalles, the county seat, as part of a plot to
take control of the county.
   Several other of the guru's followers were found guilty of
various crimes, including the man who served as Rajneeshpuram's
mayor, David Berry Knapp, known as Swami Krishna Deva.
   A spokesman, Swami Chaitanya Kirti, said Rajneesh had greeted
followers at his commune Wednesday but did not appear Thursday
because of ``pain on the left side of his chest.''
   Followers greeted his demise Friday as a liberation of the soul,
and celebrations began as soon as the news of his death was
conveyed. Another spokesman, Swami Prabhod, said there were about
10,000 followers, mostly Western, at the commune when Rajneesh died.
   Music could be heard in the background as he spoke over the
telephone from Poona, about 750 miles southwest of New Delhi.
   His body was kept in the Buddha Hall, covered by roses, for
about one hour before disciples carried it to the banks of the
River Mulamuthu, a half-mile away, for cremation.

   A federal appeals court Friday rejected a
lawsuit contending the government's fuel economy standards for new
cars endanger motorists by encouraging automakers to build less
crashworthy vehicles.
   A three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia ruled that the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration regulations were reasonable.
   The standards were challenged by the Competitive Enterprise
Institute, an organization supported by foundations and industries
that favor ``a non-government approach to regulatory issues,'' said
Sam Kazman, the group's general counsel.
   Also supporting the suit was Consumer Alert, a 6,000-member
group that wants ``expanded consumer choice in the marketplace,''
Kazman said.
   The suit charged that the government's Corporate Average Fuel
Economy standards for the 1987 through 1989 model years increased
the number of highway deaths as manufacturers ``downsized'' cars to
reduce their weight and boost gasoline mileage.
   The standards required that each automaker's fleet of cars
average 26 miles per gallon for vehicles sold in the 1987 and 1988
model years and 26.5 mpg for 1989. If some models fall short of the
standard, others must exceed it so the overall fleet average meets
the standard.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner boosted the 1990
standard to 27.5 mpg, prompting a separate Competitive Enterprise
Institute suit that is still pending, Kazman said.
   Even tougher standards would be required under bills before
Congress to renew the Clean Air Act. A Senate environmental panel
last fall voted to require an average fuel economy standard of 33
mpg by 1996 and 40 mpg by 2000.
   Automakers are fighting the proposal, which they say would force
them to discontinue all but their smallest models while consumers
are demanding bigger, more powerful cars.
   At least six other bills to boost the fuel economy standards are
pending.
   The suit accused the government of ignoring the threat to safety
posed by fuel economy standards, but the court ruled that the
agency met its legal obligation to consider the issue, Kazman said.
   He voiced disappointment with the ruling but said it cleared the
way for action on the second suit.
   ``Here we have a safety agency refusing to admit that one of its
major programs kills people,'' he said. ``In our view, the evidence
is pretty clear that NHTSA not only ignored the safety issue, but
in fact lied about it. ... Given the even more disastrous effects
of the 1990 standard on auto safety, we're hopeful of a more
favorable outcome in that litigation.''
   Tim Hurd, spokesman for the agency, said, ``We're pleased that
the court found in our favor. We're waiting for their judgment on
the other half of the suit.'' He said he was referring to another
challenge of the fuel economy standards on environmental grounds.

<HEAD>Snowstorm Blows From Rockies Onto Plains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Heavy snow and threats of heavy snow reached from the Rockies to
the upper Great Lakes on Friday from a storm that dumped up to 3
feet of snow on the mountains of New Mexico.
   In the afternoon, in southeastern Texas, a tornado overturned a
mobile home and downed power lines near the community of Hudson,
but no injuries were reported.
   At midday, snow fell from western Kansas across the Oklahoma and
Texas panhandles, northern and central New Mexico, Colorado,
southeastern Wyoming and western Nebraska.
   Freezing rain reached from central and northern Missouri across
eastern and southern Kansas, northwestern Oklahoma and into
southwestern Nebraska.
   Winter storm watches were in effect into Saturday for parts of
Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Michigan, the National Weather
Service said.
   Snowfall in New Mexico included 36 inches at Gascon, 34 inches
at Chacon, 26 inches at the Sandia ski area, 19 inches at Las
Vegas, 16 inches at Angel Fire, 14 inches at Raton and Los Alamos,
and 13 inches at Springer.
   In Colorado, new snow cover included 14 inches at Springfield,
12 inches at Durango, 11 inches south of Rye, and 10 inches at
Walsenburg.
   The snow was welcomed in parched southern Colorado.
   ``It's a beautiful snow,'' Baca County sheriff's spokeswoman
Nettie Blount said. ``It's the first major snow we've had all
winter. It's really going to be good for the farmers.''
   But there were numerous accident across the state on slippery
roads, and in Denver the storm caused delays of at least an hour at
Stapleton International Airport.
   Several schools in the Denver area either closed Friday or sent
students home early, and the city ordered a staggered release of
employees to ease afternoon commuter traffic.
   The Colorado State Patrol closed U.S. 287 from Springfield in
southern Colorado to Oklahoma due to blowing snow and poor
visibility.
   Snowfall across the Texas Panhandle ranged from 6 to 9 inches,
including 9 inches at Dalhart, 8 inches at Borger, Lefors and Vega,
and near 8 inches at Amarillo.
   Snow drifts of 3 to 4 feet were common in the Panhandle and the
state highway department ``strongly discouraged'' travel in the
area Friday, closing U.S. 287 north of Dumas. U.S. 87 northwest of
Dalhart also was closed.
   Schools were closed Friday in most of the northern Panhandle.
   In the Panhandle, cars had to wait for roads to be opened, said
Kenneth Dillard, foreman for the Texas Highway Department in
Dalhart.
   ``There was buses and vans and cars, with skis on all of them,''
he said. ``There was some happy faces when we let them by.''

   Federal prosecutors dismissed suggestions
Friday that Mayor Marion Barry was the victim of entrapment when he
was videotaped by FBI agents buying and smoking crack cocaine.
   But legal experts and federal law enforcement officials say
Barry may have no choice, in the face of overwhelming evidence he
used drugs, to claim the government improperly lured him to a hotel
room where bought and smoked crack.
   U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens said that the ``carefully planned,
carefully reviewed and carefully executed'' undercover operation
was ``scrupulously fair to the defendant, Mr. Barry.''
   ``There was no entrapment there,'' Stephens told reporters on
the steps of the U.S. Courthouse after Barry appeared before a
federal magistrate on a misdemeanor charge of possessing crack
cocaine.
   Prosecutors examined evidence gathered in the year-long
investigation of allegations that Barry used drugs and decided an
undercover operation would comply with the law, Stephens said.
   While not commenting specifically on the evidence against Barry,
Stephens indicated that his office had gathered evidence that the
mayor was predisposed toward drug use.
   ``Where there is predisposition there is no entrapment,'' the
city's chief prosecutor said, citing the Supreme Court's test on
the issue.
   The entrapment defense _ that law enforcement authorities led a
defendant to commit a crime he otherwise wouldn't have committed _
must be raised by the accused at trial. The high court has ruled
that a defendant is the victim of entrapment if not predisposed to
commit the crime that undercover police induced him to commit.
   Stephens cited evidence that Barry went to the Vista Hotel ``on
his own volition.''
   ``He went to the seventh floor on his own free will. He put
himself in that situation,'' the prosecutor said.
   As further indication of the government's confidence in the
case, Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh followed the progress of the undercover
investigation up through Barry's arrest Thursday evening at a
downtown hotel.
   As a defense, entrapment is difficult to raise but it has been
successful, notably in automaker John Z. DeLorean's 1984 acquittal
of federal drug conspiracy charges.
   De Lorean's lawyers were able to persuade jurors the automaker
was entrapped by federal agents despite videotapes showing the
defendant standing next to open suitcase filled with cocaine and
saying: ``It's good as gold.''
   But given the strength of the government's evidence, Barry's
defense ``would have to be entrapment'' even though it ``will be
impossible to sell to a jury,'' said Peter Tague, a law professor
at Georgetown University.
   An entrapment defense would open the door for government
prosecutors to present evidence of his predisposition to use
illegal drugs, Tague said.
   Tague said prosecutors would be free to present testimony by
convicted drug dealer Charles Lewis that he sold cocaine to the
mayor and used it with him at a downtown hotel in 1988.
   Even though Barry was never charged as a result of that
incident, prosecutors could use Lewis' statements as evidence the
mayor was predisposed to using illegal drugs, Tague said.
   Stephens' statements indicated that prosecutors were ready for
such a defense with evidence aplenty of the mayor's
``predisposition'' toward illegal drug use.
   Before launching the undercover sting, ``we reviewed all the
evidence we developed to date,'' Stephens said.
   But if Barry can evoke enough sympathy among jurors, he could
persuade them he was the victim of government zeal to catch him,
experts said.
   ``The jury can always say this guy was not willing to commit a
crime and the government went way too far in importuning him,''
Tague said.
   Unlike De Lorean, Barry would be accountable to more than just
12 jurors _ he must answer to voters of the nation's capital, where
he had been expected to announce plans to run for a fourth term.

   An intelligence major in the State
Security Service said Friday he let the political opposition know
the SSS was spying on it in the campaigning leading to Hungary's
first free elections.
   Maj. Jozsef Vegvari told a news conference he was making his
revelations in Hungary's ``Danubegate Scandal'' because of a heavy
conscience.
   He said that besides feeding information to the opposition, he
arranged it so a video crew could film intelligence documents that
were headed for the shredder, despite a ban on their disposal from
the chief prosecutor's office.
   The office has ordered an investigation into political espionage.
   Vegvari said the SSS was acting on instructions of the ruling
Socialist Party. The party last year changed its name from the
Hungarian Socialists Workers' Party in an attempt by the former
Communists to maintain their grip on power in the face of the
reformist tide sweeping the East bloc.
   The newly emerging opposition groups, still weak and divided,
contend that the information obtained by the government's SSS on
their tactics and candidates could give the Socialists a decisive
advantage in the March 25 elections.
   Draft legislation is expected next month in Parliament to
curtail security service operations.
   The latest allegations drew the response, ``Old habits die
hard,'' from Premier Miklos Nemeth. In an interview to be published
in Saturday's edition of the daily Magyar Hirlap, Nemeth said he
regretted not ordering a total overhaul of the Interior Ministry,
which oversees the SSS, last year.
   Brig. Gen. Jozsef Horvath, head of the SSS's Internal Security
Service, resigned on Wednesday.
   Nemeth said ``the remnants of the party-state need to be swept
away urgently,'' and promised that ``the internal security
department will be liquidated.''
   The Interior Ministry issued a statement confirming Vegvari's
status and said it initiated criminal proceedings against him for
revealing state secrets.
   The ministry rejected all charges of wrongdoing and said Vegvari
was part of an opposition political campaign aimed at undermining
the state apparatus.
   Vegvari told reporters he had a crisis of conscience during
funeral services in June 1989 for a rehabilitated Imre Nagy, the
reformist premier who was executed in 1958 following the 1956
Hungarian uprising against the nation's Stalinist regime. Soviet
troops and tanks crushed that revolution.
   He said ``events in Romania were the last straw,'' referring to
the shooting of demonstrators by Romania's secret police during the
December revolution.
   ``Black Box,''an independent video newsreel group, filmed
Vegvari's account of the surveillance on opposition groups, as well
as dozens of burnbags in the halls of an Interior Ministry
building, which allegedly contained compromising documents.
   ``The materials included reports on surveillance of opposition
political organizations, personalities, religious groups, youth
organizations, writers, artists and `irredentists,' '' Vegvari
said, referring to activists involved with Hungarian minorities in
Romania, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union.
   ``I am not a traitor to my country, but I do wish to expose the
illegal activities of this organization,'' Vegvari said, adding
that the ``KGB is active in Hungary for sure.''
   From a notebook, he read to the news conference a list of people
who were watched, mentioning opposition figures, a member of
Parliament, writers, religious figures and human rights activists.

   Mayor Marion Barry, preparing to fight a drug
charge, broke down in tears as he turned over some of his powers to
an aide after stormy meetings in City Hall on Friday.
   As the mayor was making up his mind on what to do about his job,
other officials were trying to calm nerves of agitated city
employees.
   Three members of the mayor's cabinet who sought to minimize the
mayor's problems were ``shouted down'' by others in a cabinet
meeting who said they ``too long had been part of a conspiracy of
silence,'' said one cabinet member who spoke on condition that he
not be identified.
   Other officials said some members threatened to resign if Barry
tried to carry on as usual. The cabinet has about 50 members, and
nearly all were present.
   After first saying he would ``go about the business of
government'' despite the cocaine-possession charge, Barry turned
the daily routine of the D.C. government over to the city
administrator, Carol Thompson, announcing his action in a tearful
five-minute speech, said a cabinet member speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Barry retains power to veto legislation and sign contracts,
which he cannot delegate.
   A statement from the mayor's office said he based his decision
to step aside for Thompson ``on the need for time to handle his
legal affairs, his concern for his family, and because it is in the
best interests of the citizens of Washington, D.C.''
   Earlier, in a meeting of political advisers, long-time Barry
aide Herbert O. Reid Sr., now the city's chief attorney, argued
vehemently against Barry's yielding of any power, and also against
entering a drug treatment program, while others urged the mayor to
seek treatment.
   A source familiar with decisions taken at the advisers' meeting
said a decision on entering a drug treatment program was held in
abeyance pending further discussions over the weekend.
   Campaign finance co-chairman Jeffrey Gildenhorn likened the
situation to the Richard Nixon White House during the depths of
Watergate, and officials said they were scrambling to ``calm a lot
of nerves.''
   ``It is very important that we retain some sense of normalcy,''
said city council member Betty Ann Kane after a closed meeting to
discuss the crisis. ``It was very somber in there, (with) people
still in a state of shock. Everyone is concerned about being able
to reassure people that the city is not going to fall apart.''
   Top political supporters of the mayor, who postponed plans to
declare his candidacy Sunday for a fourth term, were clearly
stunned by his arrest Thursday night.
   U.S. Magistrate Deborah Robinson allowed Barry to remain free
but ordered him to submit to weekly drug tests and set another
hearing for Feb. 5.
   Barry's attorney, R. Kenneth Mundy, said the mayor would plead
innocent to the charge of possession of cocaine and would demand a
jury trial.
   While the council members were meeting, members of Barry's staff
held a series of small meetings which one aide said were ``really
to calm a lot of nerves.''
   ``There was no undercurrent of something about the mayor being
maligned or run down,'' said the staff member, who spoke on the
condition that his name not be used. ``We were told to relax, go
about our work, and keep a stiff upper lip.''
   Council member John Ray said city employees he had seen ``had
expressions of concern, shock and dismay on their faces.''
   ``I think that's only natural,'' said Ray, who is one of four
candidates competing against Barry for the Democratic mayoral
nomination.
   Former Police Chief Maurice Turner, an unofficial candidate for
the Republican mayoral nomination, said ``the eyes of the nation
and the world'' were focused on the district.
   ``Our city will overcome this incident, and my prayers are that
the mayor and his family will overcome this incident,'' he said.
   Even some of the mayor's biggest supporters were taking a
wait-and-see approach to his latest woes.
   ``Whatever he does I think should be governed by his desire to
help the city,'' said council member Wilhelmina Rolark, a longtime
Barry backer.
   When asked whether she thought the mayor should resign, Rolark
paused for a moment and said, ``His compassion for the city ...
should govern his actions. We don't know what the circumstances are
yet, but if the charges are true, well. ...'' her voice trailing
off.
   At Barry's reelection headquarters, Gildenhorn said the arrest
reminded him of ``the Watergate situation. I feel at this point a
similar despair.''
   Gildenhorn's co-chairman, Stuart Long, said the mayor had not
decided whether he would run for reelection.
   However, Reid discounted the possiblity that the mayor would
step down.
   ``He'll be able to run the city alright,'' Reid said.

   More than 700 United Mine Workers members
garbed in camouflage green to symbolize union solidarity attended a
funeral Friday for a coal miner shot on a picket line.
   The miners, who came from five states, packed a funeral home
chapel to pay their respects to John McCoy, 42, a union miner from
Premier who was shot Tuesday morning.
   ``What meaning is there in the death of a young husband and
father?'' the Rev. Ted Osgood said. McCoy had a son, 10, and a
daughter, 9.
   At least 25 bouquets surrounded McCoy's gold casket, which was
topped with another floral spread and a folded American flag. A
yellow bed of flowers with UMWA spelled out in red stood next to
the casket.
   Many of the mourners, who arrived from Kentucky, Pennsylvania,
Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia, wore camouflage green, which
became a symbol of union militancy and solidarity during last
year's 9-month strike against Pittston Coal Group in three states.
   McCoy's death came during a union dispute with Regency
Industries Inc. and a handful of other companies that work in
southern West Virginia. McCoy was employed by a subsidiary for A.T.
Massey Coal., the target of a bitter UMW strike in 1984 and 1985.
   The union sent pickets to southern West Virginia to protest what
it said was a back-pay issue. Mine workers claimed Regency owed
them $357,000 in wages and benefits.
   McCoy and two other miners were shot as they approached a picket
site, and the assailants are still unknown, state police said.
McCoy was hit twice, in the chest and neck. The other two victims
were still in the hospital Friday, union officials said.
   McCoy's body was taken to a remote cemetery seven miles outside
of Welch for a formal UMW burial. Fellow members placed sprigs of
evergreen on the casket.
   ``In the union, we've always had the motto, `An injury to one is
an injury to all,''' said John Banovic, the union's international
secretary. ``There is no greater injury than death.''
   The last picket-related fatality in the Appalachian coal fields
came during the Massey dispute when a non-union truck driver was
killed in eastern Kentucky in May 1985.

<TEXT>
   Bulgaria's leaders on Friday faced a wave
of labor unrest as the ruling Communists headed toward an
extraordinary party congress likely to approve introduction of
multiparty democracy and other major reforms.
   The state news agency BTA said Friday more than 100 labor
conflicts were registered by newly formed, independent trade unions
from Dec. 25 to Jan. 10.
   The labor unrest surged into the open after Bulgaria's
iron-fisted Communist leader, Todor Zhivkov, was deposed on Nov. 10
in the reforms that swept Eastern Europe.
   The Jan. 30 party congress will be the first since his ouster.
   Zhivkov, who has aready been charged with malfeasance in office,
abuse of power and other crimes, was accused in a newspaper article
Friday of having been a Nazi intelligence agent in wartime Bulgaria.
   The allegations came in an article in the newspaper Otechestven
Front, which said Zhivov worked out of a Sofia villa in 1941.
   No further details were available on Zhivkov's purported
intelligence role.
   Bulgarian King Boris III sided with Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany
in 1941, and Bulgarian troops occupied parts of Yugoslavia and
Greece.
   Zhivkov himself had leveled charges of Nazi collaboration
against the family of his chief critic, reformist Chudomir
Alexandrov, when he kicked Alexandrov off the Politburo in 1988.
   BTA reported Friday that the main strike demands included
disclosure of company financial and technical status, a cutback in
bureaucracy, dismissal of discredited managers, better supply of
raw materials and equipment, and improved working conditions and
safety.
   The Communists have conceded it will take years to overcome the
nation's deep economic crisis.
   In a separate draft declaration to be presented at the party
congress this month, the party calls for a market-oriented economy.
It says the party favors ``development of a whole variety of forms
of social ownership,'' but does not spell out private enterprise.
   Documents asserting party willingness to adopt far-reaching
reforms were seen as an attempt by the Communists, now under
pressure from opposition groups and radical changes elsewhere in
the bloc, to cling to power.
   The party congress is set to adopt a statute that drops the
Marxist-Leninist label and the principle of ``democratic
centralism'' in favor of political pluralism.
   This week the Communist-dominated Parliament abolished the
party's guaranteed monopoly on political power, thus officially
ending more than four decades of authoritarian, one-party rule.
   Talks with the opposition on power-sharing and democratization
were suspended Thursday because of the Communist leadership's
apparent unwillingness to provide the opposition with a voice in
the nation's radio and television.
   The Union of Democratic Forces, the umbrella organization of all
major opposition groups, reaffirmed its right to criticize the
Communists in a statement read by spokesman Ruben Vodenicharov on
state TV Friday night.
   ``The exercise of power by a single party means that this one
party must be taken to account,'' Vodenicharov said.
   A draft declaration to be advanced at the party congress,
carried by BTA, said, ``The Bulgarian Communist Party must be
de-Stalinized and established as a new type of contemporary Marxist
party.'' It stresses the need for a radical restructuring of party
governing bodies _ the ruling Politburo and the policy-setting
Central Committee.
   ``The political system of democratic socialism implies a
multiparty system, parliamentary democracy ... separation of
legislative, executive and judiciary powers ... guaranteed
freedoms, (and) autonomy of science and education,'' it said.
   The draft proposes that all party officers be elected by secret
ballot and serve only two terms, but did not specify their duration.
   It calls for a Supreme Party Council to replace the Central
Committee; a Central Control and Auditing Commission, and a Central
Commission on Party Ethics.
   It also sets out a format for a chairmanship that would be the
apparent successor to the Politburo.
   According to the declaration text quoted by BTA, the Communist
Party is willing to recognize religious and some ethnic rights of
the minority Turks and other Bulgarian Moslems.

   U.N. and Albanian officials are working on
arrangements for Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to visit
the isolated East European country, a spokeswoman for the U.N.
chief said Friday.
   It would be the first visit by a U.N. secretary-general to
Albania, the last bastion of Stalinism in Eastern Europe.
   Albanian Foreign Minister Reis Malile invited Perez de Cuellar
to travel to his country when he visited the U.N. General Assembly
last October.
   Nadia Younes, spokeswoman for Perez de Cuellar, said no date has
been set for the secretary-general to visit Albania, but she added,
``It is only a matter of scheduling.''
   Albania's invitation to the secretary-general stems from a
``higher estimation'' of the world body's activities and ``the more
influential role the United Nations is assuming in the world
community,'' said Sazan Bejo, press secretary at the Albanian
Mission to the United Nations.
   Bejo said he had no information on dates being discussed for a
visit but U.N. officials say the U.N. chief is expected to be in
Eastern Europe in May for visits to Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
   A visit to Albania, a nation accused of serious human rights
abuses, would make Perez de Cuellar one of the most senior
international officials to visit the hard-line Communist state in
recent years.
   Albania, lying between Greece and Yugoslavia on the Adriatic
Sea, is one of the most isolated countries in the world. Albanian
authorities strictly limit foreign visitors and tightly control
access to foreign broadcasts and books.
   Despite the restrictions, there have been indications of moves
toward opening to the outside world since the death in 1985 of
Albanian hard-line leader Enver Hoxha. Hoxha broke relations with
the Soviet Union in 1961 because of Nikita Krushchev's dismantling
of Stalinism.

   President Bush, on a two-state trip in the South,
was forced to switch limousines because of mechanical problems
Friday and then switched planes for convenience.
   Bush was riding into downtown Atlanta to deliver a speech when
smoke began pouring from the hood of his armored Cadillac limousine
as a result of an oil pressure problem.
   His motorcade pulled off to the side of Interstate 75 while Bush
transferred to a backup car that always is part of his entourage.
Within minutes, he was on his way again.
   The disabled limousine was left at the side of the road with a
police guard, police spokesman Michael Powell said.
   Later, Bush flew to Miami for another speech-making appearance.
   On the flight from Washington to Atlanta and Miami, Bush rode on
the large Boeing 707 that traditionally is regarded as Air Force
One.
   However, for the flight back, Bush chose a 12-seat Air Force
C-20, the military equivalent of a Gulfstream jet.
   White House officials said Bush chose the smaller plane to shave
about 25 minutes in the flight time to Camp David, the presidential
retreat in Maryland's Catoctin Mountains.
   By using the smaller plane, Bush was able to land at the
Washington County Regional Airport at Hagerstown, Md., and then
catch a helicopter for a 10-minute hop to Camp David.
   If he had flown the larger 707, Bush would have had to land at
Andrews Air Force Base outside of Washington, and then take a 30-to
35-minute helicopter flight to Camp David, officials said.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the use of two
planes would not increase the cost of Bush's travel, since the
smaller plane always accompanies him as a backup aircraft.
   However, Bush's plane switch drew protests from the White House
press corps because he excluded reporters on the return flight.
   Traditionally, a press pool of at least 11 people accompanies
the president on all travels.
   In this instance, however, the White House refused to let any
reporters accompany the president on the grounds there was not
enough space.

   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. announced
Friday it will cancel its Philadelphia test marketing of a
cigarette aimed at blacks, saying the company's efforts have been
misrepresented by smoking opponents.
   The move came a day after the country's top health official
blasted Reynolds' ``slick and sinister'' cigarette ad campaign, and
said tobacco companies were putting profits above the health of the
poor and minorities.
   Peter Hoult, RJR executive vice president of marketing, said,
``We regret that a small coalition of anti-smoking zealots
apparently believes that black smokers are somehow different from
others who choose to smoke and must not be allowed to exercise the
same freedom of choice available to all other smokers.
   ``This represents a loss of choice for black smokers and a
further erosion of the free-enterprise system,'' he said. ``Our
sole purpose, plainly and simply, was to test market a cigarette
among smokers who currently buy competitive products.''
   Uptown, a new menthol brand of cigarette, had been scheduled for
test marketing beginning Feb. 5 in Philadelphia.
   The company had said the ads would target blacks, who, as a
group, prefer menthol cigarettes. R.J. Reynolds also said
Philadelphia was chosen because its population is 40 percent black.
   In a speech in Philadelphia on Thursday, Health and Human
Services Secretary Louis Sullivan accused R.J. Reynolds of trying
to create a ``culture of cancer'' with Uptown.
   ``We must resist the unworthy efforts of the tobacco merchants
to earn profits at the expense of the health and well-being of our
poor and minority citizens,'' he said. ``This trade-off between
profits and good health must stop.''
   Sullivan said Friday he was ``elated'' by R.J. Reynold's
decision.
   ``This is a victory for the citizens of Philadelphia, for
miniority citizens and indeed for all Americans _ a victory for
health,'' he said.
   In Philadelphia, leaders of about 30 organizations that had
banded together to fight Uptown expressed joy that the company
decided to heed their opposition.
   ``Fantastic! Super! Wow!'' responded Dr. Carl Mansfield,
president of the Philadelphia division of the American Cancer
Society.
   ``That's a really responsible act by R.J. Reynolds, and I
commend them on it,'' Mansfield said. ``We didn't know if it (the
opposition) would work, but we thought we should try to get them to
look at the social and ethical consequences'' of their marketing
plan.
   The Rev. Jesse Brown, president of the Committee to Prevent
Cancer Among Blacks, called the decision ``magnificent.''
   ``We are glad that R.J. Reynolds decided to hear us,'' he said.
``We don't want this cigarette to be marketed in any city. This
sends a signal to R.J. Reynolds that community groups can rise up
and deal with them.''
   He said that Sullivan's public condemnation of the marketing
plan was ``the icing on the cake'' to the local opposition.
   ``But I think it was really the grass-roots coalition coming
together and taking the initiative'' that caused R.J. Reynolds to
shelve its marketing plan.
   Black men have a 58 percent higher incidence of lung cancer than
white men, and blacks lose twice as many years of life as do whites
because of smoking-related diseases, according to the U.S. Public
Health Service.
   The company's promotional blitz included attempts to associate
use of Uptown with glamour and high fashion. One ad featured people
enjoying urban night life underlined with the slogan: ``Uptown. The
place. The taste.''
   ``We have made no plans for the product at this point in time,''
said company spokesman David Fishel. ``We'll just have to evaluate
the situation.''

   Mayor Marion Barry's arrest on a cocaine
charge threw the capital city's political scene into turmoil Friday
and raised new speculation concerning Jesse Jackson.
   Jackson, in Chicago, said he was ``stunned'' by Barry's arrest
Thursday night, but brushed aside as ``inappropriate at this time''
questions about whether he would enter the Washington mayoral race.
   The two-time presidential candidate established residence in the
nation's capital last year amid wide speculation he would enter the
1990 mayoral race, though he said he would not be a candidate if
Barry _ a friend from the civil rights movement _ decided to seek
an unprecedented fourth term.
   Barry's arrest, which followed years of rumor and investigations
of his activities, drew reactions ranging from sadness to joking
from political figures.
   ``It raises the Gary Hart question: How can one person be so
stupid?'' said Democratic pollster Mark Mellman, referring to the
former presidential candidate whose hopes died when his secret
relationship with a woman other than his wife was revealed.
   Jackson said he had spoken by phone with Barry's wife, Effi. ``I
am concerned with her capacity to maintain her strength through
that crisis,'' he said.
   Later, Jackson was asked in an interview from Ann Arbor, Mich
with Detroit television station WDIV what the arrest of Barry said
to young black men in the city.
   ``Crisis is any public official's life sends shock waves to all
children. I don't think you should just reduce it to a black-white
situation,'' Jackson replied.
   ``Somehow people who care must reach out with some sense of
mercy and some plan for helping the mayor, while at the same time
providing adequate and fast services for all the people of the
city,'' he said.
   Jackson has held a wide lead in opinion polls over all other
potential and announced mayoral candidates, but in recent weeks
friends have said he was moving away from a potential mayoral bid.
   Four other Democrats have entered the race, and Barry had
scheduled an announcement of his re-election campaign for Sunday.
   He postponed that re-election announcement following his arrest.
   Barry, 53, was arraigned in federal court Friday on a
misdemeanor charge of possession of crack cocaine. He was released
on his own recognizance.
   ``I'm going to leave here and go about the business of
government,'' he said leaving the courtroom. But later, he turned
over day-to-day charge of the city government to city administrator
Carol Thompson, retaining only the powers of signing contracts and
signing or vetoing legislation that he cannot delegate.
   U.S. attorney Jay Stephens said Barry's arrest at a downtown
hotel was ``part of the ongoing investigation of a broad range of
allegations'' against Barry. Federal authorities said they had a
videotape of Barry smoking crack cocaine at a downtown hotel.
   Barry has repeatedly denied allegations he has used drugs,
including the allegations by a former friend who has been convicted
on drug charges and was cooperating with authorities.
   Those denials were cited by members of both parties after
Barry's arrest.
   ``He has been representing to the young people of the district
that, drugs are bad, don't use them ... and now apparently all of
that has been hypocrisy,'' said Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va., a frequent
Barry critic and who is the ranking Republican on the House
Committee on the District of Columbia.
   Del. Walter Fauntroy, Washington's elected non-voting member of
Congress, said he was in shock.
   ``I've asked the mayor what you have all asked him,'' Fauntroy
told reporters, referring to past allegations of drug use. ``The
man has been consistent. He's said no.''
   Rep. Lawrence Coughlin, R-Pa., ranking Republican on the House
Select Committee on Narcotics, said: ``With almost an incredible
arrogance, Mayor Barry has looked the public in the eye and denied
ever having had drug usage and said he was telling the truth. The
example he has set ... is a horrendous one.''
   Democratic National Chairman Ron Brown said: ``I am saddened by
this troubling news. Mayor Barry is entitled to his day in court
and I believe that a discussion of the political options for the
District of Columbia should not interfere with the legal process,
which must go forward.''
   Sen. Brock Adams, R-Wash., chairman of the Senate Appropriations
Committee's panel on the District of Columbia, said he had been
assured by Deputy Mayor Carol Thompson that there would be no
``interruption in the processes of government.''
   Barry's arrest came after his comments in a Los Angeles Times
interview had created a new round of controversy. In a lengthy
story published Jan. 7, Barry was quoted as telling a reporter
``Isn't anybody in this town can beat me. I'm invincible.'' He also
was quoted as saying, ``Hah, Jesse don't wanna be no mayor. Jesse
don't wanna run nothing but his mouth.''
   In that story, the writer described a scene with Barry in a
late-night bar, in which the mayor was quoted as saying:
``Co-caaaane? How folks use that stuff, anyhow? You put it up your
nooose? No! Oooooooeeeeeee!''

   A jury began deliberating Friday on whether
two former Cincinnati Bell Telephone Co. installers defamed the
company and two of its managers by accusing them of engaging in
illegal telephone wiretapping.
   The Hamilton County Common Pleas Court jury deliberated less
than three hours before Judge Fred J. Cartolano sent them home for
the weekend, with instructions not to discuss the case with anyone.
   Cartolano earlier had directed the eight jurors in the civil
trial to focus on whether statements by former employees Leonard
Gates and Robert Draise harmed the company, its parent Cincinnati
Bell Inc. and phone company managers Peter Gabor and James West.
   The jury must also decide whether Gates and Draise were
negligent or demonstrated malice in making the statements, as
Cincinnati Bell, Gabor and West allege.
   ``We want your common sense,'' Cartolano told the jurors.
   The jury, which has been hearing the case since Nov. 20, began
deliberating Friday afternoon. Since it is a civil case, only six
of the eight jurors need agree on any issue for a ruling.
   Cartolano on Wednesday dismissed the defamation lawsuit that
Gates and Draise filed against Cincinnati Bell, leaving the jury to
decide only the original lawsuit the company filed against the two
former installers.
   The plaintiffs sued, demanding $2 million each from Gates and
Draise. But Cartolano instructed the jurors that they must
determine amounts to be awarded. The exception is punitive damages,
which Cartolano said he would determine if the jury decided to
award them.
   Gates and Draise accused their former employer of illegal
wiretapping of customers, including business leaders and federal
judges. Cincinnati Bell and its managers say the accusations are
lies and that the company never knew of or authorized illegal
wiretaps. Only federal judges may authorize installation of
electronic listening devices.
   Cincinnati Bell says Gates and Draise were out to get the
company because it fired Draise in 1979 and Gates in 1986. But
Gates and Draise say the company is trying to cover up its alleged
involvement.
   ``You have the ability to send Bell and other companies a
message: we're not going to stand for it,'' Draise told the jury.
He and Gates are serving as their own lawyers.
   Cincinnati Bell attorney Arnold Morelli told the jury that Gates
and Draise should not be believed because they changed their
stories, contended they could not remember dates and other details
of wiretaps, and would not take polygraph tests. Morelli noted that
Gabor and West voluntarily submitted to polygraph tests.
   Gates and Draise say they installed at least 1,200 illegal phone
wiretaps from 1972 to 1984 at the direction of Gabor and West or
Cincinnati police intelligence squad members.
   Morelli said Gates changed his story about whether Gabor or West
ordered Gates to install a wiretap on then-President Ford's phone
during Ford's 1975 visit to Cincinnati.
   Draise contended that Gabor ordered him to tap the phone of
then-Cincinnati financier Charles Keating in 1974 or 1975. But he
backed off that story when Cincinnati Bell lawyers showed that
Gabor was working in New York for American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
Co. at that time.
   ``Wild rumors, changed stories, bumping into facts, and refusal
to take polygraph tests _ what does that say about their case?''
Morelli said.

   A U.S. senator and a congressman helped
arrange for a fringe presidential candidate whose slogan is ``Keep
White Hope Alive in America'' to be considered for appointment as
the nation's poet laureate.
   Aides to U.S. Sens. Connie Mack, R-Fla., and U.S. Rep. Earl
Hutto, D-Fla., said they were unaware of Ray Rollinson's racial
slogan when they forwarded his request to be nominated to President
Bush's office and the Library of Congress.
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., also received the request from
Rollinson, and wrote a letter back to him, according to Thurmond
aide Bill Outlaw. But Thurmond did not forward the request to Bush,
Outlaw told The Associated Press in Washington Friday.
   The aid to Rollinson, 69, of Mexico Beach was disclosed in
Friday's editions of the Florida Freedom Newspapers in Fort Pierce,
Panama City and Fort Walton Beach.
   Rollinson is a self-published poet who says he also is running
for the Democratic presidential nomination ``to help counter the
racist movement of Jesse Jackson, (Democratic National Chairman)
Ron Brown and the rest of the white-is-ugly racists of the NAACP.''
   The post of poet laureate, which is appointed by the librarian
of Congress, was last held by the late Robert Penn Warren.
   ``We handled it like any other constituency service,'' said Mark
Berry, Mack's press secretary. ``There was nothing in what he sent
us that could be construed as being racist. Had we known about his
campaign, I think that would have made a difference.''
   Rollinson denies he is racist and says he did not purposely hide
his political philosophies.
   ``I am a major candidate, so I don't see how I can hide
anything,'' Rollinson said. ``My campaign is anything but racist.
There isn't a racist drop of blood in my body.''
   Rollinson was in the public eye last year when Vice President
Dan Quayle invited him to a barbecue in Washington, D.C., as a
member of the Republican Senatorial Inner Circle. After news
reports about the invitation, the GOP canceled it and beefed up
security at the vice presidential mansion in case Rollinson showed
up.
   In a press release for his 1992 presidential campaign, Rollinson
wrote that Mack and Hutto had nominated him for the poet laureate
position.
   ``Nomination is not the word I would use,'' Berry said.
   He said Mack's office sent Rollinson's request to be nominated
and samples of his poetry to Bush's office which forwarded the
material to the librarian of Congress. Thurmond and Hutto took
similar action.
   ``The stuff we got was pretty harmless, talking about walking on
the beach and stuff like that,'' said Brian Keeter, Hutto's press
secretary. ``Certainly the congressman does not condone racial
overtones, but Mr. Rollinson is a resident of the congressman's
district and we always respond to letters from our constituents.''

<TEXT>
   A shoving match between players
escalated into a brawl involving more players, hundreds of fans and
even the band at a basketball game between longtime rivals North
Carolina Central and North Carolina A&amp;T.
   ``There was general rioting throughout the gymnasium between
Central fans and A&amp;T fans,'' N.C. Central sports information
director Wallace Dooley said in a telephone interview from the
school in Durham.
   Officials for the two colleges discussed Friday what to do about
the last eight minutes of Thursday night's game at the Corbett
Center gymnasium in Greensboro, the home of North Carolina A&amp;T
State University.
   Later in the day, five members of the N.C. A&amp;T team were placed
on probation, and the schools agreed that the game would not be
replayed. N.C. Central officials announced the game would be
declared a no-contest and would not count against either team.
   N.C A&amp;T coach Don Corbett said at a news conference Friday that
he would review videotape of the game and would determine if
further action is necessary. No action has been taken against N.C.
Central players.
   ``I don't think that anybody flagrantly did anything other than
defend themselves or react to a situation,'' a visibly upset
Corbett said.
   ``Whatever I've done in 12 years I've been here all went down
the drain with 45 seconds of TV work last night,'' Corbett said.
``It went all over the universe, all over the world. We've had
calls from everywhere.''
   The free-for-all was triggered when N.C. Central forward Derrick
Leak was fouled by N.C. A&amp;T center Jimmy Humphries.
   ``Even people from the A&amp;T pep band were fighting,'' Dooley
said. ``They were hitting people with their instruments.''
   The 15-minute brawl put an end to the game with N.C. A&amp;T leading
39-38.
   Two city police officers, one campus security officer and four
students were treated for cuts and bruises and released, said Candy
Colglazier, a spokeswoman for Moses Cone Memorial Hospital in
Greensboro.
   There was conflicting information about the number of people
arrested in the melee, with a sheiff's official reporting three and
city and campus police reporting no arrests.
   City police reported seven arrests later because of a fight at a
fraternity party, but desk sergeant Gary Wilson said he was unsure
if the fighting was related to the game brawl.
   Both coaches said none of their players was hurt in the brawl,
although N.C. Central Coach Mike Bernard's glasses were broken.
   Security police, many of them in the far reaches of the
7,500-seat complex attending to a fight which earlier broke out
between two fans, arrived on the floor about two minutes after the
brawl began.
   Coaches from both teams worked to restrain their players. At
least two chairs from the N.C. Central bench were removed and used
as weapons, witnesses said.
   N.C. A&amp;T Athletic Director Orby Moss pleaded with spectators on
the public address system to remain in their seats. But several
other fights, apparently involving fans from the two schools,
continued in the stands filled to near capacity. Moss then
suspended the game and the coaches removed their players.
   The fighting continued outside among several hundred spectators
while players tried to board buses.
   Chris Fisher, athletic director for N.C. Central, said the two
teams have been arch rivals since they were both members of the
Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association.
   ``It's a natural rivalry, even though we're not in the same
conference any more,'' said Fisher.
   N.C. Central and A&amp;T have played 121 basketball games dating
back to 1930, with A&amp;T holding a 66-55 series lead.
   Bernard was disappointed the game ended the way it did.
   ``It was a hotly contested game between two rivals and it's a
shame that the game couldn't be decided tonight,'' he said. ``It's
a shame their fans didn't get the opportunity to see the whole ball
game. It would have been very exciting the last eight minutes.''

<HEAD>NAACP Chapter Criticizes Austin Schools For Holiday Selection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   School officials here are under fire from
black leaders for giving students Confederate Heroes Day off while
not making Martin Luther King Jr. Day a holiday.
   ``Why Austin refuses and, whether wittingly or unwittingly,
encourages the celebration of Confederate Heroes Day is
insulting,'' said Victor Goode, a member of the NAACP.
   ``Houston, Dallas, San Antonio and Fort Worth schools closed to
recognize Martin Luther King Jr. Day,'' Goode said Thursday during
a news conference in front of the Capitol grounds statue honoring
Texans who fought for the Confederacy during the Civil War.
   The holiday honoring the slain civil rights leader and the one
honoring Confederate leaders Robert E. Lee and Jefferson Davis are
optional state holidays.
   But there is a difference. Workers taking off the King holiday
must make up that time by working one of several state holidays.
State employees taking off Confederate Heroes Day do not have to
make up the time and those that do work get extra compensation.
   A handful of bills last year in the Legislature would have
combined the two holidays, but the proposals died in various
committees.
   Austin school officials responded to the criticism by saying
that students were given Thursday and Friday, Confederate Heroes
Day, off because it is the end of the semester. Teachers use the
time to compile grades and prepare for the spring semester.
   School trustee Bernice Hart, the only black on the seven-member
board, said the two days off at the end of the semester are given
to students each year. One of the days just happened to fall on
Confederate Heroes Day this year, she said.
   ``I had no idea it was Confederate Heroes Day,'' Ms. Hart said.
``It's simply on the calendar as the end of the semester.''

<TEXT>
   A civil trial involving an elderly man
with cancer can't be indefinitely delayed as a cost-saving move,
the North Dakota Supreme Court ruled Thursday.
   The court declared unconstitutional a budget-inspired moratorium
on civil jury trials in one of the state's court districts.
   The ruling came on a request by attorneys for Bernhard Odden,
80, who has prostate cancer. Odden, of rural Berwick, is suing a
motorist and the motorist's employer for $650,000 in connection
with a November 1986 car accident that injured Odden and killed his
wife.
   The case was scheduled for trial Jan. 29, but was put on hold
along with all other civil jury trials in the district by a
District Court judge responding to a statewide effort to cut court
spending.
   ``We'll have to live with it,'' Judge James O'Keefe, who issued
the order, said of the state Supreme Court ruling.
   ``We may have to lay off somebody because of it,'' O'Keefe said
in a telephone interview from his chambers in Grafton. ``We'll have
to make cuts someplace else.''
   O'Keefe's order was part of a statewide effort by North Dakota's
district court system to cut $1.55 million from its budget. O'Keefe
is presiding judge in the Northeast District, which includes 11
counties in the state's northeastern and north-central section.
   The order didn't apply to criminal trials.
   O'Keefe's order putting trials on hold drew protests from
Odden's attorneys, who argued that a lengthy delay could mean Odden
would never get his day in court.
   Attorneys Michael Geiermann and Casey Chapman had maintained the
judge's order could have delayed their client's trial until after
July 1, 1991, when the state begins a new two-year budget period.
The North Dakota Trial Lawyers Association weighed in on the
attorneys' side.
   The Supreme Court's five justices said Thursday it was
unnecessary for them to order a trial in Odden's case. But they
said an 18-month delay in bringing the case to trial would be
unconstitutional.
   Chapman said he is satisfied with the ruling.
   ``I think we'll get our result, which is to get a trial in the
case sooner than we otherwise would have,'' he said.
   District Judge William Neumann, who is to preside over the Odden
case, said it would be scheduled for trial soon.
   Neumann said he, O'Keefe and the district's other judge would
confer soon to decide new ways to cut the district's budget.
   ``I'm afraid the Supreme Court has asked us to pull a rabbit out
of the hat,'' he said.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Light airplane crashes in Massachusetts and Ohio claimed at
least four lives Thursday, and the FBI was investigating the Ohio
wreck to see if the executive jet was downed by a bomb.
   In the Ohio crash, a rented Learjet crashed in flames north of
Greenville, near the state's eastern edge, about 5:15 a.m.,
scattering debris over a wide area and killing both men aboard,
officials said.
   In the other crash, at least two people were killed and four
injured when a single-engine plane carrying a group on a ski trip
in Massachusetts' Berkshire Hills crashed in the front yard of a
home in Great Barrington, officials said. One of the injured was in
critical condition.
   The plane, a Piper Lance, was taking off from the Great
Barrington Airport about 7 p.m. when it apparently veered away from
the runway, clipped the tops off of several trees and crashed into
a yard about 500 yards from a home, said police Officer Paul
Montgomery.
   Montgomery said the pilot and a passenger in the front seat of
the privately owned plane were killed. Four others were injured and
taken to Fairview Hospital in Great Barrington, he said.
   The injured included three men and one woman, believed to be
from Long Island, New York, said Sharon Ebel, a spokeswoman for the
hospital. The woman, 25, was in critical condition and was
transferred to the Berkshire Medical Center in Pittsfield, Ebel
said. Names were withheld until relatives could be notified.
   In Ohio, the Learjet was flying empty to Louisville, Ky.,
suggesting the men intended to pick up cargo, said Mort Edelstein,
a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration, one of several
agencies investigating the crash.
   ``It was a streak of fire going through the air,'' said Wilbur
Baker, who saw the crash about a half-mile from his home. ``When it
hit the ground, it was a big ball of fire.''
   The FBI sent agents to investigate because the widely scattered
debris suggested the plane exploded in flight, said Ed Boldt, and
agent in the bureau's Cincinnati office.
   ``At this point we're going to determine if the crash was caused
by a bomb,'' Boldt said. The only evidence suggesting a bomb is the
scattering of debris, he said.
   The victims were identified by the Darke County Sheriff's
Department as Richard D. Hovarter, 53, of Mt. Clemens, Mich., and
Octavio ``Julio'' Mendez Jr., 42, of Ypsilanti, Mich. Hovarter was
believed to be the pilot, said Deputy David Anderson.

   Soviet Moslems by the thousands converged
on the Iranian border Friday in defiance of martial law imposed in
many parts of the Caucasus republics to control ethnic violence,
Tehran radio reported.
   A report by Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency
appeared to indicate the Soviets, many of them women, children and
elderly, were refugees fleeing the violence, which has killed more
than 70 people.
   Both IRNA and the radio were monitored in Nicosia.
   The broadcast said Soviet Moslems from the border town of
Dzhulfa gathered on the bank of the Aras River that forms a natural
boundary with Iran, chanted Islamic slogans, and threw messages in
bottles to their kin gathered on the other side.
   Many parts of the border with Iran and Turkey have reportedly
been sealed off following the outbreak of violence Saturday between
the predominantly Shiite Moslem Azerbaijanis and Christian
Armenians.
   IRNA said thousands of Soviet Azerbaijanis have crossed the
border into Iran since Thursday, indicating parts of the border
were still open.
   It said officials in Iran's east Azarbaijan province were making
arrangements for tempory housing for the Soviets. Some were staying
with relatives while others were being put up in mosques, the
agency reported.
   In an editorial, IRNA accused the Soviet government and the
Western press of trying to suppress the rights of Soviet Moslems by
depicting the clashes as ethnic rather than political.
   ``It seems that ways to suppress Moslems are being paved in the
Soviet Union also,'' IRNA said.
   The news came as Moscow appealed for an end to clashes in
Azerbaijan and Armenia, where Red Army units and KGB troops were
deployed Monday to control the ethnic violence. Soviet soldiers and
ethnic extremists were reported to be fighting in the streets early
Saturday in Baku, capital of Soviet Azerbaijan.
   IRNA said the Soviet Shiites crossed by land into Bilehsavar,
Iran, 125 miles southwest of Baku.
   Iranian news media have previously reported that dozens of
Soviet Azerbaijanis swam the Aras to visit Iran. Those reports
indicated the Soviets later returned.
   IRNA did not specify how many Soviet Moslems crossed the border
into Iran on Friday, but said 5,000 Soviet Azerbaijanis arrived in
Bilehsavar on Thursday.
   The Soviet Azerbaijanis share a common language, culture and
religion with Iranian Azerbaijanis, who make up about a third of
Iran's 55 million people. There are about 6 million Soviet
Azerbaijanis.
   Soviet Azerbaijani protesters have been demanding an open border
between the countries and tighter links with their Iranian brethren.
   Nationalists in Soviet Azerbaijan are agitating for the
establishment of a ``Greater Azerbaijan,'' an independent, oil-rich
homeland for some 20 million Azerbaijanis on both sides of the
border
   Azerbaijan, once wholly under Iranian rule, was ceded to Czarist
Russia following a war in 1828. Soviet dictator Josef Stalin sealed
the border in 1921, separating families and the ethnically
homogeneous peoples.

   A twin-engine corporate jet crashed
short of a Little Rock municipal airport runway in a storm Friday,
killing all seven people aboard, authorities said.
   The 21-seat Gulfstream II jet, carrying employees of an Eastman
Kodak Co. subsidiary, apparently was attempting a landing shortly
after 5 p.m., witnesses said.
   Seven bodies were recovered from the wreckage, said Coroner
Steve Nawojczyk, adding there were no survivors.
   ``The airplane broke apart on impact,'' Nawojczyk said.
   The plane hit guidance lights short of the airport, hit a street
near an airport intersection, struck railroad tracks and a fence,
losing a wing and wheel, and plowed 200 feet into airport property
without reaching the runway, said Bill Booker, who was at the scene.
   Heavy rain and lightning swept through the area about the time
of the crash.
   Craig Martin, a witness, said, ``First I heard like a rumbling
of thunder and as I looked out I saw streaking fire going across
the runway. It didn't look like there was anything left of the
plane.''
   Airport officials hadn't considered closing the runways because
of the weather, and decisions on landing in bad weather are up to
the pilot, said airport Manager James Rodgers.
   The plane left Longview, Texas, earlier Friday and was headed to
Batesville, Ark., said Bill Edwards, a spokesman for Eastman Kodak
subsidiary Tennessee Eastman Co. in Kingsport, Tenn. The passengers
were employees of Arkansas Eastman in Batesville, which makes
chemicals and aspirin.
   The plane was diverted to Little Rock because of bad weather,
Edwards said.
   Gary McDonald, manager of community relations for Arkansas
Eastman, identified the dead as: M.L. ``Bud'' Gernert, retired
Arkansas Eastman president, and his wife, Marian, and company
employees William Schirmer, Randy Wood, Nathan Casteel, and company
pilots Don Mason and Ed O'Neal.
   Charley Rogers, a passer-by, said he was driving on Interstate
440, which passes the airport, when he saw the plane ``hit some guy
wires or something _ I saw sparks. It looked sort of red and blue.
   ``When the plane hit the ground, it just exploded,'' Rogers said.
   ``All I saw was the explosion,'' he said. ``There were sparks up
in the air, so it did hit something in the air.''
   State Rep. Jim Keet, D-Little Rock, who arrived at the airport
on a commercial flight, said, ``It looks like a major crash scene
out here.''
   Keet said that at the time of the incident, ``the weather was
atrocious,'' and he was surprised that aircraft were coming in for
landings at the time.

   An Eastern Airlines jet landing here sheared off
the top of a twin-engine aircraft that touched down just before it
Thursday evening, killing one person and injuring another aboard
the smaller plane, officials said.
   The 7:10 p.m. collision between the Eastern Boeing 727 and a
Beechcraft King Air 100 occurred on a runway at Hartsfield Atlanta
International Airport, officials said. No one was injured aboard
the jetliner, said airport spokesman John Braden.
   The two male victims were taken to South Fulton Medical Center;
one was dead on arrival and the other was listed in stable
condition, hospital officials said. There were no reports of other
injuries.
   The collision involved Eastern Flight 111, which originated in
Montreal, and a twin-propeller plane flying from DeKalb Peachtree
Airport on the edge of Atlanta to Hartsfield, about 15 miles south,
said officials with the Federal Aviation Administration.
   ``Passengers on the Eastern flight are OK. No injuries,'' said
Eastern spokesman Robin Matell in Miami. ``The extent of damage on
our plane is wing damage. How extensive, I don't know.'' The jet
carried 141 passengers and a crew of eight, he said.
   Roger Myers, an FAA spokesman in Atlanta, said the Eastern plane
was completing its landing as the Beechcraft was still taxiing on
the runway.
   ``The Eastern airliner landed behind him, and they collided on
the runway. ... He (the Eastern pilot) was on his landing roll,''
meaning the jet was still rolling to a stop, Myers said.
   Jack Barker, another FAA spokesman, said both planes had been
given permission to land. When asked if that indicated a problem in
the control tower, he replied, ``That's under investigation.''
   Airport spokesman Braden, asked to comment, said, ``I don't
know. I haven't talked to them (the control tower).''
   Officials did not know yet how much time had lapsed between the
two landings, Barker said, although ``it was very close between the
two.''
   Myers said no fire was reported and he did not know whether
either plane might have landed improperly, causing the collision.
   Matell said an earlier report that the smaller plane had crossed
the 727's path was incorrect. ``Both planes were cleared to land,''
Matell said.
   ``It happened so fast. It was like the plane hit something and
sort of scooted to the side,'' said Eastern passenger Mike
Whittaker. ``We thought at first either he hit something or he blew
a tire. A friend of mine was looking out and he said, `I believe we
hit something, it looked like a little airplane.'''
   ``I seen this debris flying everywhere, terrible, just like it
flipped over and it was way up in the air _ terrible,'' said Rodney
Johnson, an airport ground worker who witnessed the collision.
   Braden said the twin-engine aircraft, which carried no other
passengers, belonged to Epps Air Service and was based at
DeKalb-Peachtree Airport. He said both men aboard the plane were
Epps employees.
   ``The top half of the (twin-engine) plane was pretty well
sheared off. ... The engines are intact,'' Braden said. The tail
section also was missing.
   The dead man was identified as Eric Thomas, 30, of Ackworth,
hospital officials said. Injured was Daniel Olthoff, 26, of
Norcross, who was described as ``conscious, alert and talking,''
but doctors were still examining the extent of his injuries.
   FAA officials were on the scene.
   Matell said the Eastern flight originated in Montreal, stopped
in La Guardia, and Atlanta was its final destination.
   The captain is a 23-year Eastern veteran, said Matell, who would
not release his name.
   There was initial confusion about reports of a hydraulic problem
aboard the smaller aircraft. Matell, however, said a pilot flying
another Eastern plane, landing about the same time as Flight 111,
declared an emergency while the pilot was lowering the plane's
landing gear because he thought its hydraulic system had failed.
   He said the problem on Eastern Flight 56, a Boeing 727 flying
from Miami to Orlando to Atlanta, turned out to be a faulty
indicator gauge that mistakenly signaled hydraulic failure.

   The country's top health official blasted a
``slick and sinister'' cigarette ad campaign that targets blacks,
saying tobacco companies were putting profits above the health of
the poor and minorities.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan accused R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco Co. Thursday of trying to create a ``culture of
cancer'' with Uptown, a menthol cigarette the company plans to test
in Philadelphia starting Feb. 5.
   The company has said the ads will target blacks, who, as a
group, prefer menthol cigarettes. R.J. Reynolds also said
Philadelphia was chosen because its population is 40 percent black.
   Sullivan, who has made minority health a top priority, said he
was ``alarmed and angry'' and called on the company to cancel its

   As Congress moves toward enacting tougher air
pollution controls, one of the biggest mysteries is how much it
will cost. Figures range from $14 billion a year to more than $100
billion, and some argue that doing nothing may be most expensive of
all.
   The nation's largest corporations unveiled a study Thursday
suggesting that if some of the most stringent proposals for
cleaning up the air are enacted, the cost of compliance could soar
as high as $104 billion a year.
   The actual costs likely will be less, conceded Philip
Masciantonio, a vice president at U.S. Steel, a subsidiary of USX
Corp., but he added even the study's $54 billion ``best estimate''
could be devastating to some industries.
   The steel industry's coke ovens could be shut down by toxic
chemical emission controls envisioned by a Senate clean air bill,
he argued.

   Frustrated by Ulysses S. Grant's refusal to
pose for a portrait, a Swiss artist commissioned to glorify the
Union triumph in the Civil War decided instead to paint Grant's old
nemesis, Robert E. Lee, in a daring gesture of spite.
   The long-forgotten oil painting by flamboyant artist Frank
Buchser spent the next 120 years gathering dust in a museum in his
native Switzerland _ until it was found by Swiss Ambassador Edouard
Brunner and brought back to the United States last year.
   Tonight, on the 184th anniversary of Lee's birth, Brunner will
unveil the newly restored portrait of the Confederate general at an
embassy reception attended by alumni of Washington and Lee
University in Lexington, Va.
   Lee was president of Washington College in Lexington for five
years after his April 9, 1865, surrender to Grant at Appomattox
ended the Civil War. The institution was renamed in Lee's honor
after his death in 1870.

   The sleek horse gallops around the circus ring
with a dashing acrobat and juggler standing solidly on its back.
Suddenly, the rider unfurls a colorful banner of Soviet and U.S.
flags and the audience wildly cheers.
   American-Soviet friendship steals the show at the Moscow Circus,
now on its second North American tour since ending a 10-year hiatus
in 1989. Bomb threats and rallies had greeted the circus in the
late 1970s in anger over Moscow's human rights policies. Today, the
return of American and Soviet co-ringmasters is the big news.
   Also co-starring this year is capitalism. Part of the touring
circus is operating as an independent cooperative for the first
time in 70 years.
   ``It's been a sensational success _ financially, socially,
economically, politically,'' says U.S. producer Steven Leber. ``I'm
not just saying this because it's my show: There's a love affair
going on between these countries. They don't relate like that to
the Japanese or Germans.''
   Performers in the circus _ actually a compilation of top-quality
acts from scores of Soviet circuses _ say glasnost also has
unleashed creativity and brought innovations to one of the most
popular art forms in the Soviet Union.
   ``This is a new generation of circus,'' says Svetlana Nugrazov,
a star of the circus. ``The government says it wants avant-garde.
There are no barriers now.''
   One such enterprising act is the 10-minute finale called ``The
Legend'' in which Tamerlan Nugrazov's daring horsemen fling
themselves and their horses around a darkened stage in a mock
battle scene, crashing swords and shields that flash sparks. In the
end, a beautiful woman intervenes by dropping a white handkerchief.
The fighters drop their swords, delivering yet another message of
friendship and peace.
   ``Art plays a very important role,'' said Mrs. Nugrazov, the
peacemaking woman in her husband's act. ``When people come to the
circus, they see that we're just normal people. We don't carry
guns.''
   Circus glasnost even extends to the clowns, who once had to
submit their scripts to censors watching for uncomplimentary jokes,
Mrs. Nugrazov said before a recent New York opening at Radio City
Music Hall.
   ``But now, they're saying things that we're all so happy to
hear, things they would've been shot for by Stalin.''
   The Gibaduliin jugglers dazzle the audience in pitch black by
juggling 16 flourescent juggling pins. Ruslan and Zina Gugkaev,
husband and wife, perform acrobatics while balanced on either end
of a plank some 30 feet in the air. Sarwat Begbudi spins glasses of
water in the air while standing on the back of A horse galloping
around the circus' single center ring.
   The single ring is a major difference from U.S. circuses, which
often have three going simultaneously. American circuses _ more
then 70 are active today _ tend to feature more color and
pageantry, while Soviet circuses are more intimate, with the
audience sitting right at the edge of the circus ring. Soviet
clowns also act more as ringmasters, by helping to introduce acts
as well as entertaining between them.
   Ironically, most circus performers in the United States are
natives of Europe, Asia and South America, where circus traditions
are older and generally more popular. More than half of U.S. circus
performers are imported.
   ``Some people believe it's a matter of the willingness of the
average American to subject himself to the rigors of training
without income,'' said Robert Parkinson, a circus historian at the
Circus World Museum in Baraboo, Wis. ``The thinking is that people
who would have gone into acrobatics years ago are now going into
athletics.''
   Most major Soviet cities have a permanent circus facility,
either for a local troupe or for traveling companies. An entire
government department, Soyuzgoscirk, oversees hundreds of circus
units, circus colleges and performances across the Soviet Union.
   The circus will tour the United States and Canada for six
months. Another circus, called the ``Crane unit'' because of its
feature act with the exotic birds, is also criss-crossing the
country.
   Most acts in both units are new this year, meaning most
performers are seeing the United States _ and American audiences _
for the first time.
   ``People not only like the circus as an art form, but they like
the (Soviet) performers,'' Mrs. Nugrazov, one of a few return
performers, said in her dressing room while sewing more sequins to
her already bespeckled dress.
   ``What can we think of the American public when they have given
such a warm reception to us,'' she said, noting the demonstrations
during the circus' detente-era tours in 1978 and 1979.
   With economic and political uncertainty at home, most Soviet
performers also can bank on financial and professional success from
the U.S. tour. The prestige, pay and personal experience from a
U.S. tour will sustain most performers for the rest of their lives,
said co-ringmaster Alexander Makhtiser, an actor who emigrated from
Moscow to New York about 12 years ago.
   And performers in the so-called ``Crane unit'' will make even
more than those in the main circus unit, thanks to perestroika,
Leber said.
   The main unit of the Moscow Circus once again is produced
jointly by the official circus agency Soyuzgoscirk and by Leber, a
longtime producer with such credits as the ``Jesus Christ
Superstar'' tour and ``Beatlemania.''
   But during negotiations for this year's tour, the Soviet
Ministry of Culture, which oversees Soyuzgoscirk, objected to
Leber's contract, he said. That led a group from last year's Moscow
Circus to form a circus cooperative under a different government
department, allowing them relative freedom to sign their own
contract with Leber.
   That cooperative unit is this year's ``Crane unit,'' which Leber
hopes to take on a worldwide tour in coming years. His contract
with Soyuzgoscirk for the main unit, finally signed after he agreed
to cut the optional length of his contract, gives him rights only
to U.S. tours, he said.
   The problems haven't affected this year's success, he said.
While declining to give figures, he said this year's two-unit tour
has done quadruple the business of last year. And planning already
has begun for next year.
   But for Soviet performers who must audition again for next year,
the tour literally may be a once-in-a-lifetime experience.
   ``They'll go home, it'll take about a week and they'll miss
America,'' Makhtiser said before the New York opening on Jan. 12.
``Who doesn't want to come back to such a comfortable life, to see
so much, so many colors?''
   After New York, the main unit is scheduled to appear in:
Rosemont, Ill.; St. Louis; San Diego; Inglewood, Calif.;
Sacramento, Calif.; San Francisco; Salt Lake City; Phoenix; Denver;
Kansas City; Indianapolis; and Richfield, Ohio.
   The ``Crane unit'' is scheduled to hit Reno, Nevada; Ames, Iowa;
New Orleans; St. Peteresburg, Fla.; Atlanta; Las Vegas; Birmingham,
Ala.; Greensboro, N.C.; Charlotte, N.C.; Nashville, Tenn.; and
Atlantic City, N.J.

<HEAD>General Motors: Where Humans and Technology Don't Mesh</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp., the world's largest
automaker, may suffer from a developmental warp, a systemic
imbalance between high-tech manufacturing processes and human
capacity to use them well.
   The problem is correctable, says a professor who had spent three
decades analyzing corporate structures, but it will require a
specialist, ``a five-year project-type CEO with years of
experience'' to replace Roger Smith.
   Smith, who will retire this year as chief executive officer,
initiated a $40 billion-program to modernize production facilities
in an effort to bring down costs and raise efficiency. But GM
efficiency remains low.
   The reason, says Eugene Jennings, professor emeritus at Michigan
State University and a confidential adviser to corporate chairmen,
is that GM failed to develop the human organization to work with
the technology.
   Specifically, ``The new manufacturing processes were ahead of
the available experience and knowledge of how to achieve optimal
efficiency with compatible, synchronized human organizations.''
   In short, technology was developed beyond immediate human
usefulness, a familiar problem to anyone who owns a telephone that
can do a dozen tricks, if only they were needed, or a personal
computer that defies understanding.
   Says Jennings: ``GM has too many staff personnel compared to
line, too many overseeing plant people compared to hands-on types,
at least three too many reporting levels, too many committees, too
many parts divisions with uncompetitive costs.
   ``GM fixed costs are too high relative to variable costs, and
its general and administrative costs average several times higher
per revenue dollar than the leanest competitition.''
   The statistical evidence is devastatingly clear, he says,
observing that GM's market share has dropped from 48 percent in
1980 to 35 percent in 1989 and seems to be headed lower.
   Harbour &amp; Associates of Ann Arbor, Mich., estimates that 15 of
the 16 least efficient plants in North America are GM, and among
the company's least efficient plants are several of their newest.
   Although estimates vary, average profit per vehicle assembled in
North America recently has been about $50 for GM, more than $600
for Ford Motor Co. and more than $1,000 for some of the
transplants, or foreign factories on U.S. soil.
   In Jennings' view, Roger Smith deserves credit for having
tremendous vision in devising his plan to push technology far
beyond its then-existing level early in the 1980s.
   ``It was a dream elegant in its conceptualization,'' he says,
``but it went so far so fast it surpassed the human capability to
implement it.'' Quality improved, but costs didn't fall. ``The
human aspect was a failure.''
   In retrospect, he believes, Smith carried the program as far as
any one person could, and he states that no person is sufficiently
skilled to take on such a 10-year stint. Jennings says a
second-stage leader should have been named.
   What is needed now, says Jennings, is a chairman with a clear
assignement to develop the human organization that will bring down
costs.
   In his view, the GM cost-reduction program now under way is a
good start, but it must be combined with a ``re-sizing'' of the
entire company. Re-sizing is a euphemism for shrinking the company
to an efficient level.
   How much shrinkage? Jennings declines to estimate, but John
Hammond of J.D. Power and Associates, an automotive industry
analyst, has mentioned a decline to 29 percent of market share
before stability and full efficiency are achieved.
   Jennings believes GM, which always has promoted from within,
might have to go outside the company to find the individual suited
for the challenge.
   ``This idea may have had merit in an oligopolistic market where
GM could dictate its terms,'' says Jennings. ``Good ideas are too
rare to be the exclusive province of insiders.''
   Whoever is chosen, says Jennings, has an opportunity to make GM
the best managed and lowest cost producer, assuming he can mesh
human and technological elements.
   ``Many things are in place for GM to take off,'' he said. ``It
has tremendous opportunities.''

   While making her first feature film,
``Sweetie,'' Jane Campion was too busy to critique the story. Any
message this dark comedy might carry was left to the medium itself.
   The New Zealand-born director saw herself as a pragmatist, a
problem-solver who used intuition rather than ideals to make
creative decisions. Only upon viewing the film did she permit
herself the luxury of a little instant analysis.
   ``It was a surprise to me,'' the 34-year-old director said in an
interview. ``For me it was a personal experience. When I saw it, I
thought, `There are things I wasn't expecting.'
   ``I was really rewarded by the effort. I felt really high on
occasion when some notes hit that were really special. I always
want the possibility that there is some surprise for you, that
something unique will happen.''
   With most of the cast and crew working on its first feature film
as well, ``Sweetie'' does seem to unfold at its own, unaffected
pace, as gentle as the trees that provided meaning for the film's
tortured Australian family, as dark as the lipstick worn by the
title character.
   Based on an original story by Campion and Australian author
Gerard Lee, ``Sweetie'' is minimalism from Down Under, days of rage
and days of detachment brought to theaters for a mere $1.3 million.
   The screen for this small, intimate film is filled, literally,
by Sweetie, played by first-time actress Genevieve Lemon. Paranoid
and desparately insecure, she receives tragically little support
from her moody sister, Kay (Karen Colston), and reserved parents
(John Darling and Dorothy Barry).
   Audiences are allowed to steal a glance at a family that would
rather be left alone. ``She's not evil, she just frightened,'' the
mother observes, but such insights are expressed only when Sweetie
is safely out of earshot. Once around, she's at best ignored, and
at worst, treated like a dog still in need of a slap behind the
ears.
   ``The main and most difficult dynamic was between the father and
the daughter,'' Campion said. ``It was obviously a history of a
great deal of love and encouragement between them which never
matured.
   ``He couldn't accept her as the big, fat, adult self. He could
never accept that the childhood potential that she showed wasn't
there now. He never helped her to accept reality. She was so
addicted to the love that he once gave her. She would seek it from
anyone she could get it from.''
   Campion grew up in Wellington, and originally preferred painting
and plays to film. But she learned quickly how to think visually,
admiring ``Women in Love,'' ``Performance'' and other films.
   ``I was aware at an early age how much I loved daydreaming and
story-making, how potent that was for me. I think of filmmaking as
play. It's work but I think it's play, too.
   ``I had a fairly gentle, but fairly fast introduction to
filmmaking. But I didn't want to make a feature. I wasn't ambitious
in that way.''
   She obtained a diploma in anthropology before attending the
Australian Film and Television School, where she directed three
short films: ``Peel,'' ``Passionless Moments'' and ``A Girl's Own
Story.''
   Her breakthrough came in 1986 at the Cannes Film Festival when
``Peel'' won the Palme D'Or for best short film. That same year,
Campion developed the storyline for ``Sweetie.''
   ``I approached Gerry (Lee) and said, `Let's do it together.' I
was very worried who was going to be `Sweetie.' I felt that
`Sweetie' needed to be childlike, believeable. She had to make
almost anything sound real.''
   On film, the humor is dry, ironic, matching Campion's own tight
smile and clipped accent. On the set, the laughter was loud and
jolly, reflected by the director's amused, mischievous eyes.
   ``We needed an atmosphere that was going to support her (Lemon),
being such a big character,'' the filmmaker said. ``We had a very
jolly, wild atmosphere. She would sing songs at the top of her
voice and all of us would just carry on. We all got a bit nutty at
times.
   ``The film isn't about Sweetie. To me, it's about love and
delusion and reality. She seemed to be the catalyst for a lot of
these frustrations. I'm not interested in nutty fat girls per se.
I'm interested in extremes _ in love and friendship.''

<HEAD>Drug Money Breeds Violence in Colombian Prisons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STAN YARBRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The violence of Colombia's cocaine trade
has reached into its prisons, seriously disrupting the intended
last stop in the nation's war on the cartels _ the penal system.
   Wealth generated by the trade has dramatically increased the
level of prison violence as inmates, their pockets full of money,
bribe guards to get weapons and fight among themselves for control
of contraband, according to the system's director, Jaime Camacho.
   ``As drug trafficking grows, so does the violence in the
jails,'' he said in an interview.
   A private study by a criminal defense lawyer, Pedro Elias
Rondon, concluded that at La Modelo, a Bogota jail housing up to
3,000 prisoners, violence claimed the life of one inmate every day.
   ``The bloodshed is startling,'' Rondon said.
   Camacho said Rondon's finding was exaggerated but acknowledged
that prisoners frequently killed each other. He said that many of
the killings were committed by people ``settling scores'' carried
over from previous illegal dealings with one another, dealings
fueled by drug money.
   ``They kill you in here if you don't pay your debts,'' said
Timothy Crawford, a U.S. citizen held in La Picota, which holds the
country's most most hardened criminals and is considered its most
dangerous.
   Crawford, who has been a prisoner in La Picota since his
conviction in 1985 of drug trafficking, spoke briefly to a reporter
given a tour of the prison in the company of a guard.
   During the tour, one of the prison's cold, bare hallways echoed
with shouts from inmates as the reporter was led by, asking
questions when he could.
   At one point, the prisoners were asked how weapons made their
way into the prison.
   ``We pay off the guards,'' one prisoner shouted back and the
guard beckoned the visitor on.
   Prison director Camacho said later he was convinced that some
guards, whose average monthly salary is $156, are easily bribed.
   ``The prisons are not closed off from the outside world,'' he
explained. ``There is a constant flow of money, drugs and weapons
across the gates.''
   Until recently, prison officials had only to contend with
prisoners' knives, razors and clubs. Lately they began finding guns.
   Some of the prisoners shouting through the bars at La Picota
said that they could buy a pistol from guards for a million pesos,
the equivalent of $2,300, which is affordable for a prisoner
dealing in contraband.
   On Christmas Day, inmates of Cell Block One, using at least one
pistol, took 18 hostages _ 11 guards, two police officers and five
visitors.
   Warden Sandra Urazan Perez called it the worst uprising in the
prison's history. The inmates killed a guard and held the other
hostages for two days before police freed them in an operation that
left six prisoners dead.
   Camacho said he was certain the convicts got the pistol with
``the complicity of certain guards,'' but he added that authorities
had still not officially determined this.
   The prisoners' plan to flee in the guards' uniforms was spoiled
by a special police force that sealed off the cell block shortly
after the hostages were taken, Warden Urazan Perez said.
   The convicts' connections to drug trafficking became apparent
during the uprising when they issued a communique protesting
Colombia's extradition policy and the slaying by police of a
Medellin cartel leader.
   Police shot and killed the drug trafficker, Gonzalo Rodriguez
Gacha, in a shootout Dec. 15 on Colombia's northern coast.
   His followers killed rivals four days later at La Modelo prison.
   ``I'm convinced that the prisons will always reflect the world
outside,'' Camacho said. ``Drug violence will continue to touch
prisoners inside.''
   Guards at La Picota have been victims of the prison's violence.
   ``This a tough, low-paying job that can cause psychological
problems,'' said one guard, who refused to give his name. ``Things
have been much worse since the uprising. We're all more afraid.''

<HEAD>Hollywood Writers Say Skiddoo to Historical Accuracy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eddie Murphy may be funny, but when it comes to
language, he's a linguistic laughingstock.
   Forget the four-letter words. Examine instead Murphy's ``Harlem
Nights,'' set in 1918 and 1938, and the movie's inaccurate use of
very hip phrases such as ``Gimme five,'' ``I'll let you have your
space,'' ``Take it easy,'' ``Yo!'' and ``I just need a couple of
seconds to get my head together.''
   Or put ``Fat Man and Little Boy'' under the semantic
stethoscope. The Paul Newman film, set during 1942's Manhattan
Project, bombards atomic-age dialogue with the contemporary phrase
``dead meat,'' the hip verb ``obsessing'' and the 1980s greeting,
``It's good to see you, bro.''
   Robert L. Chapman, author of ``The New Dictionary of American
Slang,'' said of all the expressions mentioned above, only``gimme
five'' and ``bro'' were on the fringes of acceptable usage during
the years in which their films were set.
   Everything else, he said, is out. Like, way out.
   While most production designers, set decorators, costumers,
property masters and choreographers seem to have mastered period
authenticity, a few scriptwriters are excelling as idiom idiots,
littering movies with linguistic anachronisms.
   Even the most conscientious writers laboring for accuracy
occasionally stumble into embarrassing verbal time warps.
   Phil Alden Robinson, the author-director of ``Field of Dreams''
and the mid-1940s period comedy ``In the Mood,'' plowed through
newspapers, magazines and court transcripts to collect realistic
dialogue for the latter film.
   ``And then I have the father say to his son in the movie,
`Life's a bitch and then you die,''' Robinson said.
   ``A few critics referred to it, saying it was a mistake to use
an '80s phrase in a '40s film. They may well be right. It just
never occurred to me that (the phrase) wasn't something I've always
heard.''
   William Safire, who writes the language column for The New York
Times Magazine, noted that Robinson, Murphy and Roland Joffe,
director and co-writer of ``Fat Man and Little Boy'' stand in good
company.
   ``Whatever they did, it wasn't nearly as horrendous as what
Shakespeare did by having a clock in `Julius Caesar,' because back
in the days of Julius Caesar (100-44 B.C.) there were no clocks,''
Safire said.
   Syndicated language columnist Jeffrey McQuain said the musical
``Phantom of the Opera,'' ostensibly set in 1911, features the
World War II aviator's expression ``point of no return'' 30 years
prematurely.
   Odds for such historical gaffes increase, as young writers and
directors raised not on literature but on television and movies
work more steadily in the industry.
   Lacking the proper dictionaries (or professional interest), the
greenhorn (circa 1785) may assume ``A-OK'' is ages old, but it's
from the Eisenhower years. Has ``hoosegow'' been slang for ``jail''
since the time of Lewis and Clark? Nope _ try 1860.
   When budgets and time permit, some scripts are submitted to
fact-checking firms such as de Forest research in Los Angeles,
which charges $3,500 and up to review a period feature for legal
and historical problems.
   A fair number of writers don't know much about inaccurate
language, said Peter Sloman, a senior researcher at de Forest.
``But for those who do know, it can be like listening to an
operatic aria where all of a sudden a note comes in a third below
where it's supposed to be,'' he said. ``It can be that jarring .. .
as annoying as the big vaccination scars on Indians in (movies set)
in 1865.''
   Yet research firms only serve as advisers on language, and can't
really order changes. Furthermore, improvisational performers such
as Murphy, Robin Williams and Dustin Hoffman are bound to say
whatever comes to mind, whether it's in the script or not.
   And sometimes, too much attention to historical accuracy can
backfire.
   When Paramount Pictures released ``Black Rain,'' an action movie
largely set in Japan, the studio's press materials and
advertisements featured the movie's title printed in Japanese
characters. Too bad they translated as ``Black Nane.''

   The pension board of the Evangelical Lutheran
Church in America has spurned church orders to divest from firms
doing business in South Africa.
   But the denomination's interim policy group, the church council,
is examining ``possible options'' for dealing with the board's
refusal to comply with an action last August by the denomination's
assembly.
   It had ordered the pension board to get rid of holdings by
September 1991, in all companies with direct or indirect business
in South Africa as a protest to its apartheid system of racial
separation.
   The pension board in October asked that the assembly action not
be implemented, saying it would jeopardize income, break trust with
pension members and make the board liable for damages.
   A report on possible courses of action comes before the church
council at its April meeting.

   A United Methodist bishop says congregations
in that big but shrinking denomination are not evangelizing as much
as they should, and they should be held accountable for it.
   Bishop George Bashore of western Pennsylvania told a recent

   `We are developing processes for the evaluation of clergy
throughout our denomination, but I believe we are much more
cavalier in calling our congregations to accountability for what
they are doing.''
   The United Methodist Church has 8.9 million members, making it
the nation's second largest Protestant denomination, but the
membership has declined steadily for 25 years from an all-time high
of 11 million in 1965.
   Bashore said, ``We need to redirect resources from places that
aren't taking off to churches that will take off in the name of
Jesus Christ.''

<HEAD>Chilean Victims Plan Criminal Complaints Against Military</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDUARDO GALLARDO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Victims of human rights abuse are
planning ``a giant wave'' of criminal complaints after the military
steps aside in March, posing a potentially risky problem for the
new civilian government.
   The military, which has ruled for the last 16 years, has made it
clear it will not tolerate prosecutions of its members even though
it will be out of office. But the victims and their relatives
insist they will not give up their demands for justice.
   The independent Chilean Human Rights Commission says it has
124,000 cases of human rigts violations ``duly documented, ready to
be brought before the courts'' immediately after the inauguration
of the new government. Most of them involve military officials.
   ``It will be a giant wave of trials,'' said Gonzalo Taborga, the
commission official in charge of international affairs.
   ``We will encourage people to bring their cases to the courts,
because justice is essential for the stability of our future
democracy,'' Taborga said in an interview.
   Many Chileans fear that pushing the human rights issue too hard
could trigger a violent reaction by the military and put the new
civilian government in danger. President-elect Patricio Aylwin
takes office March 11, replacing the longtime right-wing military
ruler, Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
   Pinochet recently warned, ``If one of my men is touched, the
rule of law will be broken.''
   Pinochet, who seized power in a bloody 1973 coup, plans to stay
on as commander of the powerful 60,000-men army. He is sheltered by
a clause in the 1980 constitucion, drawn up by his regime, which
prevents Aylwin from naming a new commander.
   Taborga dismissed the danger of a new coup as a result of the
trials.
   ``It will be the other way around,'' he said. ``The trials will
strengthen democracy and the sense of justice.''
   Aylwin has vowed ``to find the truth and do justice'' in the
human rights violations. But he has also stressed the need for
``extreme prudence.''
   He also has promised to seek compensation for many of the
victims.
   After the 1973 coup, thousands of supporters of the toppled
leftist government were detained. Many were killed, tortured or
confined to secret prisons or detention camps. Tens of thousands
were forced into exile abroad.
   Francisco Cumplido, Aylwin's appointed minister of Justice, said
the future government ``will fulfill its promise of finding the
truth and doing justice in the human rights abuses.''
   ``We will of course act with the political caution required in
such a complex problem, combining the interests of the victims with
the stability of the government,'' Cumplido said.
   But he added, ``We are not saying that a reason of state may
prevent seeking the truth, doing justice and compensating the
victims.''
   In an interview earlier with the Santiago daily Las Ultimas
Noticias, Cumplido was quoted as saying the armed forces can be
assured that the new government is not planning ``a witch hunt'' on
the human rights issue.
   Aylwin and his top aides have said any problems in the human
rights area will be dealt with through the regular courts and not,
as some have suggested, through special tribunals or commissions.
   But still it will be a complicated situation for the Aylwin
government, caught between the warnings from the military, and the
often impassionate pressures for justice from the victims and their
relatives and from political groups, many of them his allies.
   The military government issued an amnesty law in 1978 covering
all the abuses occurred since the 1973 coup.
   Aylwin's platform calls for ``repealing or anulling,'' that law,
but recently his aides have suggested such an action, fiercely
opposed by the military, may be dropped.
   Cumplido told Las Ultimas Noticias that there is ``an
alternative strategy'' for achieving justice in pre-1978 cases
without necessarily repealing the amnesty.
   He did not elaborate, but the comment, supported by other Aylwin
aides, seemed aimed at appeasing the military on an issue that is
widely expected to be the most sensitive in the relations between
the armed forces and the new civilian government.

   In Septmber 1986, Bill Moyers, publicly worrying
that CBS News was yielding to ``the encroachment of entertainment
values,'' left CBS and returned to public TV. He has been very,
very busy there ever since.
   This year will be no different. On Sunday, Jan. 28, PBS'
resident philosopher and essayist launches the second season of his
``World of Ideas'' series, this one a once-a-week, 52-week series
of half-hour interviews.
   In March, he'll have a 90-minute special, ``From D-Day to the
Rhine'' _ his trip to Europe last summer with a group of World War
II infantrymen who fought from the invasion of Normandy in 1944 to
Germany and the war's end in 1945.
   Next fall, he'll have ``Amazing Grace,'' a 90-minute special
about John Newton's classic hymn as told by those who've sung it,
among them opera's Jessye Norman, pop singer Judy Collins and folk
singer Jean Ritchie.
   Also afoot: ``Kids at Risk,'' a study of high school graduates
who can't function in society, and a 1991 special that, as he puts
it, examines why college athletes ``can be stars on Saturday and
failures in life.''
   Moyers' first ``World of Ideas,'' which led off with filmmaker
David Puttnam, had five interviews a week for 10 weeks with a
varied mix of subjects.
   The more leisurely second round, for which Moyers says he has a
three-year, $2.5 million-a-year funding commitment from General
Moters and the MacArthur Foundation, is equally eclectic. It starts
with Robert Lucky, chief of communications research at Bell
Laboratories.
   Others on the roster include filmmaker Steven Spielberg,
neuro-philosopher Patricia Churchland and playwright-director Peter
Sellars.
   As in his first batch of ``Ideas,'' Moyers doesn't fear the term
``talking heads,'' shots of interviewer and subject talking. For
some TV executives of the keep-it-moving MTV generation, talking
heads mean many turn-offs.
   ``Sometimes they are turn-offs,'' he concedes in his soft Texas
accent. ``The question is, are the talking heads thinking minds and
thinking people? Are they interesting to watch? I think the most
fascinating production value is the human face.''
   Moyers, press secretary to President Lyndon B. Johnson, then
publisher of Newsday newspaper before finding TV a bully pulpit for
ideas and essays, is less critical of network TV news now than
when, dismayed, he left that arena.
   However, like former CBS correspondent Ike Pappas, he does worry
that some of network news ``is dominated now by producers _ which
is not itself a bad thing if they started out as reporters and
journalists.
   ``But if all they know is pictures and editing, then the success
of the piece is at the expense of the journalist.''
   Still, he says, some network newscasts he has seen _ mostly on
weekends _ ``are very good.'' He singles out CBS' Saturday and
Sunday night newscast and the ``CBS News Sunday Morning'' that
Charles Kuralt anchors.
   ``I'm a big fan of Kuralt's show,'' he says. ``It's the most
visually interesting and literate broadcast on the air.''
   On most weeknights, he says, he watches Cable News Network,
likening its newscasts to the straight-ahead ``CBS Evening News''
when Walter Cronkite anchored it.
   ``CNN is doing the basic nuts and bolts of news the way Cronkite
used to do it,'' Moyers says, venturing that in time Ted Turner's
24-hour CNN ``will be the staple of most people.''
   The primary reason, he says, is that ``our work habits, travel
schedules and living habits are such now that it's very hard to
create a critical mass of audience at a given time. So you have to
be there when people want you.''
   Will network evening newscasts eventually go the way of the
pterodactyl? Moyers, the former commentator on those of CBS,
doesn't know.
   ``It's hard to fathom the thinking of the people who are in
charge'' of the networks now, he says. ``As long as they are making
money out of it, I think they will continue what they're doing.
   ``But I find it hard to believe that all three of them can be
making money out of newscasts that are essentially alike.''

   Elsewhere in television:
   ECOLOGY AND THE TUBE _ Salesmen for Ted Turner, cable maestro
and environmentalist, are trying to syndicate an ecological cartoon
series, ``Captain Planet and the Planeteers.'' With Tom Cruise as
the voice of Capt. Planet, the show has episodes on oil drilling,
acid rain and toxic waste dumping, and villains named Hoggish
Greedly, Looten Plunder and Sly Sludge.
   CBS, also keen on the global ecosystem, is considering a series
pilot called ``The Elite,'' starring Gil Gerard. It's about a team
of experts ``fighting to protect an increasingly fragile
enviroment.''
   And ABC will air a celebrity-filled enviromental show on April
22 called ``The Earth Day Special.''
   Some cynics speculate that if all this keeps up, some evil
corporation is certain to commission a special called ``Just Say No
to Rain Forests.''

   The Agriculture Department is re-checking some
payments made under the 1988 drought relief program and
congressional leaders are urging policy reviews after The
Associated Press found widespread misapplication of funds in the
$3.9 billion emergency effort.
   One New Jersey farmer has been asked to repay $100,000 after a
federal agent read AP reports that checks went to corporations and
farmers ineligible for disaster aid. Entire counties in California
and New Mexico are being investigated as well, according to the
Agriculture Department.
   The AP found that the program became a one-time windfall for
thousands of farmers outside drought areas whose losses were due to
normal quirks of nature. Claims were approved for such common
perils as insects, sand, wind, cold and fungus, even ``ineffective
herbicide'' _ all of which were outside the bounds of the drought
effort.
   Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., a member of the House Agriculture
Committee, called the AP series ``a needed story'' and said
Congress must try to establish safeguards to prevent problems in
future agriculture disaster programs.
   ``We have to set up some structures,'' Roberts said. ``That's
why I think the AP series and other examples have been very
beneficial. They point up the road we should not take.''
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said his department's
Office of Inspector General probably will investigate the 1988
relief program and likely will study the AP series, which appeared
in December.
   ``The fact is, these kinds of programs are exceedingly difficult
to administer, and they have inherent shortcomings,'' said Yeutter,
who was interviewed recently at a wheat growers' convention in
Texas. ``It's not that people avoided their responsibilities or
were cavalier in the implementation; it's simply that it's just not
an ideal way to deal with this problem.''
   The Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, the arm
of the Agriculture Department that administered the program, is
already checking specific misdeeds spotted by the AP, deputy
administrator Dan Shaw said in Washington, D.C.
   The ASCS says, however, that it won't check beyond the 22
counties in eight states the AP examined in its investigation.
   ``Those few that I was concerned with, we are checking to make
sure corrections will be made,'' Shaw said.
   Shaw said other counties won't be studied because ASCS officials
don't believe serious problems exist nationwide. ``I think (the AP)
did a pretty good job,'' he said. ``I think you came up with the
same problems we were having administering the program.''
   But Dennis Pryslak, the New Jersey lettuce grower who was
ordered to repay the aid he received, said it's unfair to single
him out just because he was mentioned in an AP story.
   ``There's 50,000 other guys out there in the same situation and
we got caught,'' said Pryslak.
   Yeutter said he hoped to avoid future big-buck bailouts, either
by improving the federally subsidized crop insurance system or
creating a permanent, efficient disaster program.
   ``We simply cannot afford a combination of the two,'' Yeutter
said. ``The combination of mousetraps that we're using to deal with
natural disasters in this country is not a very desirable
combination.''
   If Congress chooses to finance disaster programs rather than
subsidize crop insurance, the Agriculture Department will go back
and examine the problems the AP found, he said.
   ``One could put in place permanent disaster legislation that
would be a potential substitute to crop insurance,'' Yeutter said.
``Once the administrative system was put in place, we wouldn't have
the kinds of problems that were cited in your articles, or at least
they'd be dramatically minimized.''
   The AP stories appeared amid an intensifying debate in
Washington over the value of crop insurance vs. year-to-year
disaster relief. Earlier this month, Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kansas,
senior member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, renewed his call
to strengthen crop insurance and clean up excess in farm disaster
programs.
   ``We were begging for disaster help for Kansas wheat farmers
(last year) and there were other senators fighting for the
watermelon and pickle growers,'' said Dole spokesman Walt Riker.
   ``What he's saying is, let's clean up crop insurance and make it
attractive for farmers to participate in. Let's not have these
whole programs where the country is paying for `ginseng root
relief,''' Riker said.
   Ginseng root was among the many crops eligible for disaster
assistance in 1988.
   Indeed, the AP study, conducted over seven months, found that
payments went far beyond the initial intent, supported by almost
everyone, to save Midwestern grain growers from bankruptcy. Growers
collected on everything from kiwi fruit in California to Christmas
trees in Connecticut. Checks were written for rain-bloated tomatoes
in New Jersey and washed-out bird seed in Colorado.
   Rep. Kika de la Garza, chairman of the House Agriculture
Committee, defended the disaster relief program and contended the
benefits to truly drought-stricken areas were ``camouflaged'' by
abuses found by the AP.
   ``Legislation at best is an imperfect endeavor,'' de la Garza
said. ``Therefore there are those (mistakes) that for one reason or
another fall through the cracks. That always happens when we do
legislation in an emergency situation.
   ``I would have liked to have taken more time. I would have liked
to have done more study. But there was no time. Something needed to
be done.''
   Some problems the AP found, such as farmers ``triple dipping''
by collecting disaster aid, crop insurance and growing a
replacement crop all on the same acreage, were corrected in the
1989 relief program, de la Garza said.
   The House committee, de la Garza said, will look into the
reported abuses and ask the Agriculture and Justice departments to
see if fraud or other illegal acts were committed.
   ``Already, from word of mouth, we've been looking,'' de la Garza
said.
   Two weeks ago, the ASCS asked Pryslak to return his $100,000 in
assistance within 30 days. The AP had reported that his business
exceeded the $2 million revenue limit, disqualifying it from the
federal program.
   Pryslak, who has appealed the decision, said he gave the local
ASCS office correct information and asserted he was paid through
the agency's misinterpretation of the rules.
   ``If I knew about the $2 million ceiling, I wouldn't have taken
the money,'' he said.
   Peter DeWilde, the ASCS director for New Jersey, said errors
were made on both sides.
   ``He didn't give us some information and some information we
didn't ask for,'' he said. A determination of Pryslak's appeal is
expected by the end of February.
   ``Sometimes the rules are hard to interpret, and then sometimes
the rules are changed on us,'' DeWilde said. ``We welcome any
chance to make sure these people deserved to be paid.''

   ``An iron curtain has descended across the
continent,'' Winston Churchill proclaimed in 1946, popularizing an
image for the chain of barbed wire, watchtowers, walls and armed
guards that would divide Europe for 43 years. As revolution swept
Eastern Europe, Associated Press Correspondent Marcus Eliason and
Photographer Diether Endlicher went on a journey that took them
from the northern end to the southern end of the continent's
ideological faultline.

<TEXT>
   One crisp evening, as Eastern
Europe was becoming free, an old man named Johan Pavtits sat near
the Hungarian border fence and remembered a December day in 1948.
   That was when the barbed wire went up between Lutzmannsburg in
Austria and Zsira in Hungary, and soldiers came from the Hungarian
hinterland. They knew little of the bonds that had tied the two
villages for generations. Innocently they asked a farmer for the
loan of his pliers so they could tighten the wires in what would
come to be known as the Iron Curtain.
   ``The world ended here. But it was only half a world. The other
half was over there,'' said Pavtits, gesturing with his callused
laborer's hand at the lights coming on in Zsira, 300 yards east.
   ``And now the barbed wire is being taken away, and the world is
whole again.''
   The world is whole again _ it was a refrain heard constantly by
an Associated Press reporter and photographer on a journey from
Travemuende, the West German port where the Iron Curtain begins
with watchtowers and high fences, to Trieste, the Italian port
where it ends in a rusty, shin-high rail.
   The most vivid image of the Cold War was in collapse: border
walls piled in useless slabs; the barbed wire from uprooted
Czechoslovak fences coiled by the roadside; deserted, padlocked
watchtowers.
   Countryside once quiet, divided and remote now was alive with
traffic jams of East German day-trippers coming west, with tearful
villagers surging through fences to meet neighbors for the first
time, with a ferry boat making its first crossing of the Elbe River
in 44 years, and with East and West German border guards who once
glared at each other now chatting as though they always had been
friends.
   It was a time of pure euphoria, when people everywhere welcomed
each other with open arms, and the politicians and armies along the
Iron Curtain suddenly became mere onlookers.
   The Iron Curtain, the image popularized by Sir Winston Churchill
in a speech March 5, 1946, at Westminster College in Fulton, Mo.
(``an iron curtain has descended across the continent''), now would
need an epitaph.

<TEXT>
   ON THE BALTIC: The Iron Curtain begins without preamble _ a
string of buoys in the Baltic Sea and then a row of border posts
marching ashore at the Priwall Peninsula, at the West German port
of Travemuende.
   Here, just weeks after East Germany opened its borders, is a
sense of what the Iron Curtain was: freedom up to the border
markers, with strollers braving the icy December wind; then barbed
wire and watchtowers looming forbiddingly out of the fog.
   Then, six miles south, comes the first sign of change: the quiet
checkpoint of Schlutup buzzing with Trabants, the smoky little East
German cars that have become the most immediate symbol of the new
freedoms.
   New holes were constantly opening in the 871-mile chain of
walls, fence and watchtowers of the German-German border.

<TEXT>
   AT HITZACKER, 50 MILES SOUTH OF LUEBECK: A ferry toots its horn,
the last passengers scramble aboard and it chugs off on a
six-minute voyage to the East German bank of the Elbe River.
Michael Brese, 31, is skippering the first service across the Elbe
since April 1945, when his grandfather's ferry was sunk by American
artillery.
   As soon as he had heard the border was opening, he says, he sent
leaflets to the East German village across the river: ``Be at the
fence on Nov. 18; we're coming to fetch you.''
   In the past, such audacity would certainly have gotten him
arrested.
   Now he finds hundreds of East Germans waiting for him, pressing
against the fence, shouting, ``Open the gate!'' The East German
guards refuse, but they soon cave in. So many cheering, weeping
people clamber aboard that the ferry is briefly grounded.
   ``When we were children we used to fish in the river and we
would gaze across, hoping to see maybe a face in a window, or
someone walking,'' he says.
   ``We had a saying: `The Elbe has only one bank.' Well, now it
has two banks again.''
   Brese has punched his own, personal hole in the Iron Curtain.

   ZICHERIE AND BOECKWITZ: Before the Iron Curtain descended
between them, the 700 villagers shared a school, dairy and fire
brigade. But then, Zicherie became a tourist attraction where
Westerners could stand and stare at the lost eastern portion of the
Fatherland.
   Now the wall is open. A man from Zicherie walks through,
presents a glossy calendar to the East German guards in Boeckwitz,
and returns beaming with pride at his contribution to German
brotherhood.
   ``Everything we teach here has suddenly become history,'' says
Birgit Neyhaus, who works at Zicherie's Political Education Center
where West Germans can learn about East Germany. One recent day,
she says, the unthinkable happened: an East German teacher showed
up to ask her whether he could bring in his class to learn about
West Germany.

   PHILIPPSTHAL, IN HESSEN STATE: As American soldiers patrol,
bulldozers open a new crossing. Two GIs walk up, looking for pieces
of the Iron Curtain as souvenirs. The East German guards are
uncooperative and the GIs leave empty-handed.
   An American patrol ambles up to the 650-year-old bridge linking
Philippsthal to Vacha. The soldiers gaze at the crowds walking over
the bridge past an ugly gray watchtower. The Philippsthal people
pay no attention, but across the way, the East Germans, never
having seen ``the enemy,'' seem fascinated.
   Things have changed:
   _Horst Badura, the Philippsthal town councilor, exults: ``We
used to be Siberia; now we're the middle of Germany.''
   _Christian Schlenczek, a Hessen forester, no longer has to wait
six weeks for permission from East Germany to fell a dying tree
near the border fence.

<TEXT>
   SUNDAY IN AUTENHAUSEN IN BAVARIA: At 10:15 a.m., a gate in the
old border fence opens and people are reunited with neighboring
Lindenau.
   Hundreds surge through, led by a brass band.
   An East German border guard, poised to stamp passports, is
washed aside in the flow.
   ``Forget it,'' his commander tells him. ``This is hopeless.''
   The two villages look remarkably alike: half-timbered houses,
narrow lanes, farm smells. But for 35 years they saw nothing of
each other except their respective church steeples, a mile apart.

   Each time he starts a sentence, he interrupts himself with a

   BRATISLAVA, CZECHOSLOVAKIA: This city of 500,000 lies right on
the Iron Curtain but now it seems as if it had just experienced a
liberating explosion.
   Posters and political cartoons adorn every wall and shop window.
A building displaying a hammer and sickle of communism is festooned
with 25 protest banners.
   ``WE ARE WITH YOU'' _ on an unfinished highway bridge.
   ``RETURN SMREKOVICU TO THE PEOPLE'' _ in a sporting goods shop,
referring to a government ski chalet.
   Schoolgirls copy slogans into their exercise books and chuckle
at a cartoon of ousted Communist Party boss Milos Jakes. In a
cultural center, crowds listen to a troupe playing Slovak folk
music, while children watch Tom and Jerry cartoons on TV and munch
corn on the cob sold by a cheerful street vendor.
   For the first time in 20 years the newspapers contain real news,
and long lines form to buy them.
   Until a few days earlier, residents of Bratislava's high-rise
apartments could only look across the Danube into Austria and into
the eyes of freedom. Vienna is just an hour's drive away, but to go
there people had to have official permission, fill in reams of
forms and leave behind a close relative to guarantee their return.
Now they just go off in the car; visa requirements for Austrians
and Czechoslovakians were abolished in time for Christmas.

   NORTH OF BRATISLAVA: Whole stretches of fence lie uprooted in
messy coils by the roadside. A man clambers down to the Morava
River, a Danube tributary that was off-limits for 20 years, and
casts his line to fish.
   Michal Stolar and three friends collect Christmas trees on a
hillside. Two days earlier they were among 6,000 Austrians and
Czechoslovaks who formed a 4{-mile human chain across the border to
celebrate the opening of the fence.
   Stolar, a 30-year-old geologist, knows his Iron Curtain
intimately: ``A fence two meters (6 feet, 6 inches) high, then a
strip with flares that went off when they were stepped on, then a
second fence, 2.80 meters (nine feet) high. ... There were 187
strands of wire in each fence. Altogether enough wire to circle the
earth 1{ times.''
   But three months earlier, a Czechoslovak doctor had outwitted
the Iron Curtain. He escaped over it on a motorized hang-glider.
   Ten miles to the north, a watchtower stands abandoned next to a
German World War II bunker. Across the road, Josef Zapletal, 56, is
repairing a fence on the collective farm where he has worked for 25
years since the Communists confiscated his private farm.
   The windows in the watchtower are broken. Zapletal says they
were smashed by the guards, celebrating the death of their patch of
the Iron Curtain.

   HEGYESHALOM CHECKPOINT ON THE HUNGARIAN BORDER: Guards wave
lines of cars through and the duty free shop is doing brisk

searched for Bibles, Western magazines and hidden escapees.
   Along the roads, signs offer tourists rooms for rent, churches
and shops are open, a picture of Christ is tacked to a tree, and
little is left to suggest that this had once been one of the

   LUTZMANNSBURG, AUSTRIA: Heinz Ritter is a 50-year-old
schoolteacher and local historian whose scrapbooks and photos now
are helping nearby Hungarian scholars fill the blanks created by
communist censorship.
   ``They have the same problem that my generation had after
Hitler: to find out what was true, what really happened,'' Ritter
says.
   ``You can't flee history.''
   In Ritter's father's diary, the entry for Dec. 14, 1948, records
the departure of Lazslo Kobor, Lutzmannsburg's handyman. Kobor
returned to his village of Zsira, 300 yards away in Hungary. Then
the fence went up, and he didn't come back for 41 years. Now 60, he
is back in Lutzmannsburg, mowing lawns and painting window frames.

   TRIESTE: In Winston Churchill's description, this Italian port
on the Adriatic was the southern end of the Iron Curtain.
   Trieste became a Cold War flashpoint when Yugoslavia claimed it
after World War II. But the dispute was settled in 1954, Yugoslavia
left the Soviet bloc, and the frontier at Trieste is largely
unfenced. Thousands of Yugoslavs travel to Trieste to work or shop,
while Triestinis own summer houses on Yugoslavia's Istrian
Peninsula.
   Europe's ideological divide finishes at Muggia, the Venetian
quarter of Trieste.
   An Italian customs officer is puzzled by visitors coming now
looking for the place where the Iron Curtain ends.
   ``Iron Curtain?'' he says. ``There's no Iron Curtain here.''
   And so it is, all the way from the Adriatic to the Baltic.

   ``From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic an iron
curtain has descended across the continent.''
   So declared Winston Churchill on March 5, 1946, in a speech to
Westminster College in Fulton, Mo.
   ``Behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of
Central and Eastern Europe,'' he said.
   The wartime British prime minister had it almost right: as
things later turned out, the Iron Curtain started at the West
German port of Travemuende on the Baltic Sea, about 150 miles west
of the Polish port of Stettin. In 1946, the division of Germany
into separate states was not yet envisaged. Stettin, now Szczecin,
lies near what is today the eastern border of East Germany.
   Churchill did not coin the term ``Iron Curtain.'' A British
newspaper had used it the year before to define Europe's post-World
War II ideological divide. But it was Churchill's speech that
popularized it as an image of the Cold War.

   M.K. ``Pete'' Peterson trusted his stockbroker.
He says that was his mistake.
   The 70-year-old retired corporate executive claims that in April
1987, on his broker's advice, he entered into a series of
complicated transactions that depended on a stock price rising. It
didn't.
   The October '87 market crash left Peterson with $800,000 in
losses from speculative trades in sophisticated securities with
fancy names like ``naked puts'' and ``margin calls.'' Now the
Dallas millionaire wants his money back.
   Peterson has taken his case to arbitration, the out-of-court
forum where Wall Street firms require customers to resolve disputes
with brokers.
   But like many disgruntled investors whose savings are squandered
through naivete, bad judgment or broker incompetence, Peterson
contends he cannot get a fair hearing because the arbitration
system favors the industry.
   ``My life's about over but I've got one more battle to fight and
I'm going to win it,'' said Peterson, who claims the case has cost
him about $2 million in trading losses, taxes, legal fees and other
expenses _ about half his net worth.
   Arbitration has come under increased scrutiny since the Supreme
Court last May upheld the constitutionality of contracts that
require brokerage customers to settle grievances before a hearing
panel rather than in court.
   Opponents claim arbitration is biased because it is run by the
nation's stock exchanges and other self-regulatory bodies and
because panels contain an industry representative. Proponents say
it is quicker and faster than litigation and investors do just as
well in recovering losses.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission last year approved
reforms designed to remove secrecy surrounding the process and ease
what advocates of arbitration say is an unfounded image of
anti-customer bias.
   ``Arbitrators are deciding the case, not some board of directors
of a stock exchange,'' said Theodore A. Krebsbach, director of
litigation for the Wall Street firm Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
``It's a perception thing, not a reality.''
   Unlike litigation, arbitration panels make decisions based on
information presented, without complex rules of evidence.
Arbitrators do not have to explain decisions and appeals are
limited. Panels usually consist of one securities industry
representative and two arbitrators representing the public.
   ``The worst thing is having a cadre of retired brokers and
managers _ people who depended on the industry for ideas and money
for years _ sitting in judgment on people who have been ripped off
by brokers,'' said Robert Dyer, an Orlando, Fla., lawyer who
handles securities arbitration cases.
   Because of the key Supreme Court ruling and the bull market
followed by huge investor losses in the crash, arbitration claims
have surged. A total of 6,101 cases was filed in 1988, vs. 830 in
1980.
   Industry figures show investors won 51 percent of the 3,731
cases decided in 1986-88. Of 102 rulings in a three-month period
last year, victorious plaintiffs recovered about half of the losses
they claimed, according to a study by Securities Arbitration
Commentator, a Maplewood, N.J., newsletter.
   But if pre-arbitration settlements are included, industry
officials estimate about 75 percent of grievances result in some
monetary award _ high by legal standards.
   While customers such as Peterson have resources to fight, others
are not as fortunate. A divorced New Jersey teacher who lost
$100,000 in the crash claimed that trading by her Shearson broker
was irresponsible and unsuitable. She sought $357,441.84 in losses
and damages. She got nothing.
   Others do well by the process. A divorced Los Angeles mother
recently won $403,000 in a case alleging inappropriate investments
by her PaineWebber Inc. broker. In a rare punitive damage award,
arbitrators also ordered the firm to pay her $100,000 and the
broker to pay $50,000.
   But because arbitration panels do not have to issue written
opinions, it is difficult to determine the basis for decisions.
Prior to last May, the self-regulatory groups were not even
required to disclose arbitration awards.
   The New York Stock Exchange and National Association of
Securities Dealers handle about 90 percent of the nation's
arbitrations, with the rest occurring at smaller exchanges.
Brokerages own and control the self-regulatory groups.
   Partly because of the bias perception, the Securities Industry
Conference on Arbitration last year required that customer
contracts highlight arbitration clauses, formerly buried in fine
print. Exchanges also limited independent arbitrators' ties to Wall
Street.
   But lawyers want more choice in deciding who sits on arbitration
panels, a larger pool of arbitrators to choose from, mandatory
written opinions and the right to substitute an independent
arbitrator for the industry panelist.
   ``I want someone who is more representative of my client than
someone who is more representative of the types of people we're
suing,'' said New York lawyer Theodore Eppenstein, who
unsuccessfully argued the Supreme Court case involving arbitration
contracts.
   Last week, the self-regulatory bodies agreed to study a proposal
by the Securities Industry Association, Wall Street's main trade
group, to remove arbitration from industry auspices to an
independent forum, such as the American Arbitration Association.
   Stock exchange officials defend the current system and see no
need to replace it, even though arbitration programs are costly.
For example, the NASD said it spent $7.09 million on arbitration in
1987-88, recovering just $1.34 million in fees.
   Arbitration's backers say that adding written opinions and
appeals will make arbitration resemble litigation _ more expensive
and drawn-out for everyone, defeating the purpose. Lawyers, they
say, prefer court because they can make more money.
   ``It probably gets down to economics,'' said Edward W. Morris
Jr., the NYSE's arbitration director. ``Legal fees are less in
arbitration.''
   Exchange officials maintain that industry panelists are tougher
on their counterparts because they are concerned about preserving
ethical standards. Having an ``expert'' also helps decipher complex
cases, they say.
   ``The people who serve on these panels ... do so because they
feel very strongly about the integrity of the industry,'' said
Scott Noah, assistant general counsel for the American Stock
Exchange.
   Pete Peterson would disagree. The investor claims the
arbitrators hearing his case laughed and talked during testimony by
one witness. Hearing transcripts show one panel member told
Peterson he did not like his personality and another asked why he
was so foolish to trust his broker.
   Peterson claims the broker embarked on a too-risky strategy and
ignored repeated instructions to bail out and cut his losses.
   Bruce Collins, an attorney for the brokerage, Rauscher Pierce
Refsnes Inc., said Peterson was a savvy investor who agreed to the
transactions and simply took a beating. The firm denies wrongdoing.
   Collins claimed Peterson _ who has hired a public relations
firm, written protests to the NYSE, Congress and the SEC, and paid
for an outside study of his case _ is challenging the arbitration
panel because he fears he will lose.
   Merits aside, the Peterson case shows that investors unhappy
with arbitration do not have alternatives. Some lawyers say the
lack of choice and flaws in the process subvert investor protection
intended by Depression-era securities laws.
   ``Stockbrokers say `Trust us with your money, you're in good
hands with us,''' said William F. Davis, a Los Angeles lawyer.
``Then when you lose it they say, `That's the breaks.'''

<TEXT>
   Not far from the site where David
fought Goliath, archaeologists are peeling the mystery away from a
vast industrial complex in a network of artificial caves dating
back at least 2,700 years.
   Maresha, the likely birthplace of King Herod, flourished as a
commercial center of about 5,000 people, said archaeologist Amos
Kloner. Unique among the ancient cities, Mareshites established
their industry underground. They raised pigeons, manufactured olive
oil, stabled horses, collected rainwater and buried their dead in
underground chambers chiseled from soft chalk limestone.
   Kloner, who has spent 15 years excavating and mapping the
network of more than 1,000 interlocking chambers, said the caves
were in continuous use from at least the 8th century B.C. until 40
B.C. when Maresha was overrun by Parthians from ancient Armenia.
Why they invested so heavily in underground development is still a
puzzle, especially since there are no natural caves in the region.
   Kloner, of the state Antiquities Authority, suggests the reason
may have been simple practicality.
   The caves were apparently created when the ancients quarried
stones to build a hilltop fortress and surrounding houses, he said.
``Maybe it was easier to use such chambers since the walls and roof
were already in place.''
   The lifestyle, especially during the pagan Hellenistic period
when Maresha reached its peak a few centuries B.C., is becoming
clearer.
   Teams have unearthed a fortress tower, ordinary houses,
thousands of pottery vessels, figurines, a horde of silver coins
and an almost perfectly preserved olive oil factory. ``As far as
the Hellenistic period is concerned, there is no site more
important,'' Kloner said.
   Particularly important are silver coins, the newest of which
were dated 112 B.C. and found in a house above one of the cave
systems. Kloner said the date confirmed Jewish sources about the
conquest of the city by John Hyrcanus I, who forced the Edomites to
convert to Judaism.
   Pointing to an inscription found in a series of gabled burial
chambers, Kloner translated the Greek: ``The bones of Beretanu and
Appolonius, the sons of Antipater.'' A later Antipater was the
father of Herod the Great, and the name in Maresha may be further
proof of Herod's origins here, he said.
   Most figurines and other remains in the burial chamber were
looted during the 1970s. In addition to the theft problem, the
caves are dangerous, and are officially closed to the public. The
hilly terrain is punctured with open pits from collapsed chambers,
some concealed by overgrowth. The caves have no lights and in
recent years, three spelunkers have been killed and a dozen injured.
   The Jewish National Fund plans to open the site to the public by
next year after the government spends about $1 million to make the
site safe.
   The caves, in the Judean foothills 30 miles southwest of
Jerusalem, are along a highway built on a Roman road that passes
Crusader ruins and the grassy fields of Shephela where David the
Israelite defeated the Philistine champion Goliath. That
confrontation was about the same time Maresha is first mentioned as
an inheritance of the Tribe of Judah in the Bible (Joshua 15:44).
   The most visually stunning finds are the olive oil works, where
giant stone crushers, weights and storage chambers are virtually
undamaged. The only things missing are the giant wooden beams used
to squeeze the olive mash. The oil was drained along channels cut
in the floor to a collection pit that could store 5,000 gallons.
There are about 70 such factories in the caves, and Kloner
estimated nearly half the oil, used for heating and lamps, was
exported.
   Another cave contains 1,900 holes the size and shape of modern
loaves of bread and which housed thousands of pigeons. In fact,
some contemporary birds have sneaked in and can be heard cooing.
Underneath are 2-yard-high trenches Kloner said were used to
collect the droppings for fertilizing crops.
   ``Even today, pigeon manure is considered by farmers to be the
best,'' he said, adding that pigeons were also raised for meat and
exported.

<HEAD>55 Percent of Scientists Give Frog Dissection Thumbs Down</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Researchers are jumpy about the practice of
dissecting frogs in biology class, and would like the practice
excised from curriculums.
   Out of 365 letters to Research and Development magazine in
response to an October editorial, 55 percent supported a statement
that dissection should not be required in high school biology, 40
percent said it should be required, and 5 percent were undecided,
said Robert Cassidy, editor-in-chief.
   ``The results are surprising in that we expected more scientists
and researchers to favor dissection of frogs in biology classes,''
Cassidy said. The poll wasn't scientific because the comments were
voluntary, he said.
   The issue of frog dissection gained national attention in 1987
after a Los Angeles-area girl refused to participate, citing moral
beliefs. The case led to a 1989 California law allowing students to
refuse to dissect animals. A case also cropped up last year in New
Jersey, where a girl cited religious beliefs.
   The Animal Legal Defense Fund, which estimates that 5.7 million
animals are killed each year for dissection in colleges and high
schools, also has begun a campaign to inform students about their
right to refuse to dissect animals.
   In the survey, scientists who were against dissection wrote that
students don't really learn anything from the practice, that it's
inhumane and that it does not foster a good education, Cassidy said.
   ``The fact that these people took the time to write is telling.
I mean, they took office polls and everything. Some told of their
own personal experiences ... how humiliating it was.''
   One high school graduate who survived worm, grasshopper and frog
dissections said she doesn't understand what all the fuss is about.
``When I did it in high school, it wasn't this huge issue like it
is now,'' said Cynthia Lu, a student at John Marshall Law School in
Chicago. ``You did it and didn't question it.
   ``I didn't have too many problems with it _ the frog was already
dead.''
   Research and Development, based in Des Plaines, is a worldwide
publication for scientists and decision-makers in the research
industry.

   Inflation increased modestly in 1989 to an
8-year high of 4.6 percent, boosted by double-digit price increases
for dairy food, eggs, tobacco and fuel oil, the government said.
   In December, consumer prices climbed a moderate 0.4 percent
despite a sharp rise in fuel oil costs during the holiday cold
snap, the Labor Department reported Thursday.
   Economists attributed the relative stability of consumer price
increases to the Federal Reserve's tight money policy. Consumer
prices rose 4.4 percent in 1988.

   The White House broke with its usual practice
of not commenting on Federal Reserve policy by suggesting that cuts
in interest rates ``are justified'' by current economic conditions.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Thursday that
the Jan. 8 reduction in the prime rate by banks, to 10 percent from
10.5 percent, ``hasn't been totally passed through'' and that the
administration hoped it would be.
   Bond prices, meanwhile, tumbled amid increasing fears of
inflation, dimmed prospects for lower interest rates and a growing
belief that the economy has hit bottom.

   Housing starts slumped in 1989 to their lowest
level since the 1982 recession, the government said, but many
analysts looked for further drops in mortgage rates to improve the
situation in 1990.
   ``The drop in December housing starts is primarily due to severe
weather in most of the nation last month,'' John A. Tuccillo, chief
economist for the National Association of Realtors, said Thursday.
   The frigid weather pushed December starts to their lowest
monthly level since October 1982, which in turn contributed to the
year's downturn.

   French chemical giant Rhone-Poulenc SA has
agreed to merge its pharmaceutical business with Rorer Group Inc.
in the latest drug industry deal that seeks to lower research costs
and gain global market reach.
   The two companies announced Thursday that Rhone-Poulenc would
contribute nearly all of its worldwide pharmaceutical operations to
Rorer in exchange for 68 percent of the new company's stock. The
remaining stock would be offered to shareholders in Rorer, best
known for its Maalox antacid.
   The deal, estimated to be worth about $3 billion, would produce
one of the world's 10 biggest pharmaceutical companies in terms of
sales and the second biggest in Europe, the companies said.

   Most of the benefits from cutting
capital-gains taxes would go to people who report gains year after
year, not those whose incomes are boosted once in a lifetime by the
sale of a family farm or business, congressional analysts said.
   The report released Thursday by the staff of the Joint Committee
on Taxation rebuts a key Bush administration argument for the
reduction and provides new evidence for Democrats who view a
capital-gains cut as a windfall for the rich.
   The analysis found that 58.9 percent of the gains recorded in a
5-year period were reported by people who had gains every year.

   The brokerage accounts of three foreign
companies and a Swiss investor accused of insider trading of Rorer
Group Inc. stock have been frozen, federal securities regulators
say.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission announced Thursday that
it had obtained a court order in New York on Wednesday to freeze
the accounts pending a hearing later this month.
   The defendants named in the SEC complaint were: Fondation Hai,
of Monte Carlo, Monaco; Holding Protection Ltd., Athens, Greece;
Unifund SAL, located in Kasslik, Lebanon; and Robert Rossi of
Geneva, Switzerland.
   The SEC charged the four with trading on inside information
about merger talks between Rorer, a Fort Washington, Pa.,
pharmaceutical company, and an unidentified company.
   Later Thursday, Rorer Group said it had agreed in principle to
sell 68 percent of its stock to France's Rhone-Poulenc SA for a
package of cash and securities anticipated to be worth about $73 a
share.
   The SEC said it had evidence that the defendants allegedly
bought Rorer common stock and call option contracts ``while in
possession of material non-public information concerning
negotiations for the acquisition of a controlling interest in Rorer
by a European company at a substantial premium over the market
price.''
   The SEC claimed the defendants stood to make $6 million from
those trades.
   Neither Rorer nor the European suitor was accused of any
wrongdoing.
   Gary Sundick, an SEC attorney in Washington, would not disclose
how the defendants allegedly obtained the inside information,
saying it was not part of the public record.
   The SEC complaint claimed the alleged insider trading took place
between Jan. 4 and Monday, when Rorer disclosed negotiations were
under way.
   The SEC also alleged that ``certain unknown purchasers'' bought
Rorer option contracts and common stock through financial
institutions in Zurich, Geneva and Lausanne in Switzerland. The
banks and brokerage houses also were not accused of wrongdoing.
   The court order, signed by U.S. District Judge Robert J. Ward,
freezes the brokerage accounts of the named defendants and the
Rorer-related assets of the unidentified defendants pending a
hearing Jan. 30.
   At that hearing, before Judge Shirley Wohl Kram, the SEC will
seek a preliminary injunction. The SEC also wants the defendants to
disgorge $6 million in alleged illegal profits and pay fines
totaling three times that amount.
   Sundick said he did not know who was representing the defendants
in this country. Ward's order Wednesday was a move sought
unilaterally by the SEC, he said.

   New York Stock Exchange President Richard
Grasso plans to comment on a study of stock trading by the Office
of Technology Assessment when the congressional think tank meets
next week.
   Grasso is part of a blue ribbon panel convened by OTA to review
its study of information technology in the securities markets. The
panel is slated to meet Monday to review a draft report.
   Published reports in The Wall Street Journal and USA Today this
week have indicated the study, in the works for the last 18 months,
is critical of the NYSE's specialist system of trading, in which
stock can only be traded through certain designated exchange
members who are charged with maintaining an orderly market in that
security _ even if it means buying or selling the stock because no
other takers can be found.
   Spokesmen for various organizations in New York and Washington
declined to comment on the reports or said they had not seen the
study.
   A spokeswoman for the NYSE, Sharon Gamsin, said the study is not
complete yet. ``We will comment on the final study study when their
report is issued,'' she said.
   Jean McDonald, a spokeswoman for OTA, an arm of Congress that
analyzes science and technology and its potential impact, said the
study was requested in June 1988 by the House Energy and Commerce
Committee, headed by Rep. John D. Dingell, D-Mich.
   A spokesman for the committee said he hadn't seen a final copy
of the draft and couldn't comment on what action, if any, Congress
might take.
   The study was an outgrowth of the 1987 stock market crash.
Critics claimed the selloff was worsened by computer-driven program
trading.
   A draft of the OTA study is to be reviewed Monday in Washington
by a panel that includes market professionals, regulators,
academics, bankers and others.
   The final report will be submitted to a 12-member congressional
board _ equally divided between Democrats and Republicans, House
and Senate members _ which oversees the OTA.
   If approved by the board, the study will be released to the
public, said Ms. McDonald.
   ``We do not make any recommendations,'' she said. ``We lay out
the various policy options.''

<TEXT>
   As Campeau Corp. gradually lost its footing last
year, a unique group of financial middlemen that helps keep
department store shelves stocked demonstrated the powerful role it
plays in retailing.
   These middlemen, known as factors, told several apparel
manufacturers they wouldn't step in to accept the credit risk of
Allied Stores Corp. and Federated Department Stores Inc., Campeau's
American retailing arms.
   The snub didn't push Allied and Federated over the brink and
into bankruptcy court. But by raising the prospect of bare shelves,
the move by factors may have nudged the Campeau divisions in that
direction.
   Without the faith of the factoring and credit community, the
nine Allied and Federated chains from New York-based Bloomingdale's
to The Bon Marche in Seattle were in danger of losing face in the
industry.
   Factoring companies have significant power in the apparel
industry, which supplies merchandise that accounts for the bulk of
sales at many department stores. Their relationship with
manufacturers is closer than that between traditional credit rating
agencies or bill collectors and clients.
   Like credit agencies, factors advise clothing makers whether
it's wise to deal with a particular retailer. But in addition,
factors assume the credit risk of retailers for manufacturers and
advance loans to apparel makers, as well as performing much of
their bookkeepping work.
   ``To a certain extent, we're a special breed,'' said Francis X.
Basile, chairman and chief executive officer of the country's
largest factoring company, CIT Group-Factoring Inc., a subsidiary
of Manufacturers Hanover Corp. and Japan's Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd.
   Factoring is a long established but little understood
occupation. The practice probably goes back to antiquity but its
modern evolution in this country began in colonial times when
agents known as ``factors'' were hired to service mills in England
and Europe.
   It started as a service at the wholesale end of the distribution
chain, involving fabrics sold by textile mills to manufacturers,
and evolved to include goods sold by manufacturers to retailers.
   A factor buys a manufacturer's accounts receivables and assumes
the risks that those bills will be paid. If a retailer doesn't come
through with the money for an order of women's dresses, for
instance, a factor still has to pay its client, the dress maker.
The factoring fee averages about 1 percent of the volume of the
receivables.
   Factors play a key role in the garment trade because the
industry is dominated by small to medium-sized companies that can't
afford to assume credit risks themselves.
   Because they're putting their money on the line, factors don't
want their clients to accept orders from shaky retailers. But
factors can't be too conservative. Their clients need to sell and
could find others more eager for their business.
   Basile said he tells his staff: ``Be liberal but don't get
stuck.''
   Factors also will allow clients to draw advances against the
receivables, giving them cash to manufacture pending orders.
Factors charge interest on advances outstanding.
   ``The well-run, the intelligent factor is going to tailor-make
an arrangement for its clients or potential clients,'' Basile said.
``The uniqueness of what we do allows us some latitude in
structuring deals and helping clients.''
   Factoring companies also perform all the bookkeeping tasks for
some of their clients, essentially becoming a client's credit
department.
   Factoring has had an image problem, and some outsiders confuse
them with lenders who charge excessive interest.
   Basile, who has been in factoring and commercial finance for
more than 30 years, said when he was new to the business he was
told that companies that used factors were a step away from
bankruptcy _ a notion he rejects.
   ``The fact of the matter is we have among our clients ...
companies that are the Rock of Gibralter financially,'' he said.
   Still, some companies prefer not to disclose that they use
factors, making it impossible to gauge how much merchandise in
stores is factored. Industry estimates range as high as 70 percent.
   The volume of receivables factored in the apparel industry was
nearly $45 billion in 1988, according to figures compiled by the
textile and apparel trade publication Daily News Record.
   Although largely confined to the textile and apparel trades,
factors are active in footwear and home furnishings. The Trust
Company Bank in Atlanta also handles factoring in seafood and
trucking.
   ``We have tried to spread our tentacles. There's no reason why
many businesses can't be factored,'' Basile said. ``I think that we
have trouble getting into certain businesses because we have an
undeserved reputation.''
   Factors once were small independent outfits until banks started
acquiring them. Basile said a factor doing $2.5 billion in annual
volume was a giant in 1980. CIT's volume last year was about $7.5
billion.
   Some banks in recent years have withdrawn from factoring and
sold out to others. In the past 10 years the number of factors has
been halved, with about 15 to 18 left.

<TEXT>
   Some suppliers for Campeau Corp.'s U.S.
department stores say they've resumed shipping merchandise despite
being unable to cash checks the retailers issued shortly before
seeking bankruptcy court protection.
   Analysts had called the resumption of normal shipments the most
pressing issue for the stores under Chapter 11 protection,
especially for stores in the South, where the spring selling season
opens soon.
   ``Right now, we're not asking anything from them except to honor
the normal conditions of business,'' said David Pergola, senior
vice president for sales at the Greif Cos., which began shipping
clothing Thursday to Campeau's stores.
   ``We are confident that by the weekend, fresh spring merchandise
will be going out to all of Campeau's stores,'' said Bernard Chaus,
whose Bernard Chaus Inc. sold the stores $40 million in clothing
last year.
   Chaus said his company hadn't been able to cash some checks
Federated issued before Monday because the bankruptcy court had
frozen the retailer's bank account.
   Many suppliers, however, said they want to see a court-approved
financial plan expected this week from Federated Department Stores
Inc. and Allied Stores Corp. before shipping goods.
   ``I am planning and hoping to ship to them. I'm waiting to hear
some more news,'' said Howard Bloom, president of Chetta B, a New
York clothing maker. ``I'd hate to ship now and not get paid. I'd
look like a fool.''
   Meanwhile Thursday, Campeau spokeswoman Carol Sanger said the
company doesn't plan to sell assets to satisfy the debts of
Federated or Allied.
   ``The company has no intent to conduct a fire sale,'' she said.
``We are not talking about a liquidation, we are talking about
restructuring a corporation.''
   Federated and Allied, which own such department store chains as
Bloomingdale's, Lazarus and Rich's, filed for protection from their
creditors Monday under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act.
The chains, with 258 stores and 100,000 employees in 43 states,
listed debts of $7.7 billion and assets of $9.1 billion.
   Department stores risk losing customers if they can't offer
fresh merchandise or if their shelves begin to show gaps from lack
of inventory.
   ``The question is, are all vendors going to go along with that,
be comfortable doing that, and that is a hard call,'' Jack Seibald,
a retail analyst for Salomon Bros. in New York, said of the
prospect for renewed shipments. ``My guess is the bigger ones will
go ahead.''
   Parfums Stern Inc., a cosmetics maker, Movado Watch Corp. and
Lenox China said they haven't decided when to resume shipments.
   Fred Kalmar, vice president for finance at Bugle Boy Industries,
said the clothing company has been promised a report on Campeau's
financing this week.
   ``We do plan to support the Campeau stores,'' Kalmar said.
   Liz Claiborne spokeswoman Sarah Patterson said the company has
clothing shipments prepared but is waiting for a financial plan
Campeau promised to provide by Friday.
   Liz Claiborne tops the lists of unsecured creditors for many of
the Federated and Allied stores, with the bankruptcy filing listing
millions of dollars in debts. Ms. Patterson said the company didn't
know how much the stores owe.
   Leslie Fay, a sportswear maker, began shipping orders to
Campeau's stores Thursday, said senior vice president Herman
Gordon. He estimated the stores' outstanding account with Leslie
Fay at ``a couple of million dollars,'' but said he was confident
of repayment.
   ``We are going to be shipping to them on the regular terms we
have always dealt with,'' Gordon said.

<TEXT>
   The Chapter 11 filing by Campeau Corp.'s
retailing divisions could cost some former top executives
retirement benefits totaling as much as $10 million.
   About 525 former executives of Federated Department Stores Inc.
and Allied Stores Corp. are in that group. They account for less
than 2 percent of Federated's 25,000 retirees nationwide, but their
claims are the largest and the least likely to be fully paid.
   ``We're talking about executives with six- or seven-figure
incomes, not widows and orphans,'' Campeau spokeswoman Carol Sanger
said.
   Campeau, the real estate company owned by Canadian Robert
Campeau that acquired Allied in 1986 and Federated in 1988, put its
U.S. retail operations under bankruptcy protection Monday as a way
to keep the 258 affected department stores operating.
   The stores are profitable, but Campeau owes about $7.7 billion
largely because of the high cost of financing the acquisitions.
   ``It seems somehow wrong that people who worked hard for many
years are now victims of Mr. Campeau's takeover,'' said James
Selonick, a former Federated vice president. ``Our money, which is
a good many million dollars, is being used to bail out Federated,
and I think that's unreasonable.''
   Selonick and other former executives are listed among
Federated's creditors in 6,000 pages of bankruptcy documents the
company filed.
   Most of those losing their pensions will be senior executives
who took part in senior employee retirement plans and deferred
compensation plans or who had signed individual employment
agreements.
   Others are executives who worked for Federated before 1953, when
its current pension plans were established. The former employees'
pre-1953 benefits are not protected from the bankruptcy.
   All other pensions, life insurance, and medical benefits paid by
Federated are protected under bankruptcy proceedings, Ms. Sanger
said.
   The bankruptcy filings listed 25 Federated executives who will
lose an undetermined amount of benefits from individual employment
agreements they had signed. Retirees who signed such agreements
typically earned $100,000 to $1 million a year.
   ``Those things are not protected in a trust because they were
individually negotiated and the payments stop in a Chapter 11,''
Ms. Sanger said.

<HEAD>American Expands European Service, But Cuts Some Cities</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Airlines said it was boosting its
European service overall but delaying some new services and cutting
certain existing routes because it doesn't have enough airplanes.
   In addition to London routes gained in recent deals with TWA and
Texas Air Corp., American said Thursday it would add nonstop
flights from Chicago to Glasgow, Scotland, and to Munich and
Dusseldorf in West Germany.
   The expansion gives the Fort Worth-based carrier 145 flights a
week to Europe, a 22 percent increase.
   ``We believe the restructuring will make us a stronger, more
vibrant competitor in the European market place,'' said Mike
Buckman, vice president of sales. ``We're determined to make
American the leading U.S. carrier in the European market.''
   Analyst Mark Daugherty with Dean Witter Reynolds said the move
``just underscores their aggressive ambitions to secure and
implement U.S.-European service prior to 1992,'' when Europe hopes
to abolish most internal trade barriers.
   American also announced it has applied to the U.S. Department of
Transportation for six routes between the United States and Japan.
The routes are: Chicago-Tokyo, Chicago-Nagoya, Los Angeles-Tokyo,
Los Angeles-Nagoya, San Jose-Tokyo and San Jose-Nagoya.
   With the European expansion, Buckman said international
operations will amount to about 15 percent of the carrier's
business.
   In separate deals last month, American, the nation's biggest
domestic carrier, bought the Chicago-to-London route authority of
Trans World Airlines Inc. and the Miami-to-London route flown by
Texas Air's Continental Airlines. The Continental route was a small
part of an overall $471 million deal with Texas Air to buy the
Latin American routes and some other assets of Eastern Airlines.
   Federal authorities still must approve those deals. Pan American
World Airways has challenged the Eastern deal.
   While boosting European service overall, American will drop
current non-stop service to Frankfurt and Lyon, France, from New
York, and cease one-stop flights to Stuttgart and Hamburg, West
Germany, and Geneva, Switzerland.
   American also is delaying previously announced plans to fly from
Chicago to Helsinki, Finland, and Warsaw, Poland, and from
Dallas-Fort Worth to Barcelona, Spain.
   ``We're anxious to service those cities,'' Buckman said, but
``we don't have the long-range, `over water' aircraft required.''

   FBI raids in 15 states targeted producers of
counterfeit automotive parts, which automakers say cost them
millions of dollars and may pose safety threats.
   No indictments have been issued and no arrests have been made,
FBI spokesman John Anthony said Thursday. He said agents were
tallying the number and value of the confiscated parts, expected to
be in the millions of dollars.
   The raids came after 2{ years of undercover investigation into
counterfeit parts. General Motors Corp. said that according to a
Federal Trade Commission study, consumers spend about $3 billion
yearly on fake auto parts.
   Richard Sherman, general director for U.S. sales and marketing
in GM's Service Parts Operations, said the company had found
dangerous parts carrying the GM label, including brake linings made
of cardboard and oil filters made of rags and a perforated food can.
   ``We have no problem with legitimate manufacturers of quality
auto parts,'' said Kenneth Myers, marketing manager for Ford Motor
Co.'s Parts and Service Division.
   ``We have a big problem, however, with manufacturers and
distributors of poor quality, unsafe and defective parts who
wrongfully try to market their products as genuine Ford parts,'' he
said.
   The FBI conducted raids in California, Florida, Georgia,
Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New
York, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Washington, Anthony said.

<HEAD>Corporation Asks Addition of Former FHLBB Chairman as Defendant</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The nation's former top thrift regulator joined
with his subordinates in a vendetta against Lincoln Savings and
Loan Association, the former holding company for the thrift alleges
in a U.S. District Court filing.
   Attorneys for Phoenix-based American Continental Corp. on
Thursday asked Judge Richard M. Bilby to add Edwin Gray, former
chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, as a defendant in the
holding company's suit against current and former S&amp;L regulators.
   The case is scheduled to go to trial March 27 in Tucson.
   Gray, currently an officer of Chase Federal Savings Bank in
Miami, could not be reached for comment. Telephones went unanswered
at the bank and his home.
   American Continental sued last spring, claiming that regulators
had undercut its efforts to save Lincoln, a $6 billion thrift
headquartered in Irvine, Calif.
   The filing came after American Continental filed for
reorganization under federal bankruptcy laws on April 13 and the
government seized Lincoln, the holding company's chief asset, on
April 14. The government bailout is expected to cost at least $2
billion in taxpayer money.
   American Continental also is suing in a federal court in
Washington to overturn the government's seizure of Lincoln.
   Investors, meanwhile, are suing Lincoln in U.S. Bankruptcy Court
in Phoenix alleging the loss of $250 million on junk bonds
purchased through the thrift.
   American Continental spokesman Bradley Boland said the company's
motion to include Gray as a defendant alleges that Gray and others
engaged in ``a pattern of leaking confidential, inaccurate and
misleading information to the press.''
   The pattern was systematic and done in retaliation for American
Continental's criticism of re-regulation of the S&amp;L industry, which
Gray was promoting, Boland said in a news release.
   The release of information sullied the reputations of Lincoln
and American Continental and damaged their business relationships,
he said.
   Michael Gallagher, an attorney for American Continental, said
the decision to include Gray as a defendant was based partially on
testimony by Rosemary Stewart, a regulator for the Treasury
Department's Office of Thrift Supervision, before the House Banking
Committee last year.
   Ms. Stewart, who worked for the now-defunct FHLBB under Gray,
said she sensed a ``hidden agenda on the part of certain agency
officials with regard to Lincoln.''

<HEAD>Company Offers $1,000 To Employees Who Buy American Cars</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A company chairman grew tired of seeing
foreign cars in his firm's parking lot, so he offered a bounty _
$1,000 to any employee who buys an American-made car or light truck.
   ``All it's got to be is an American label on an American-made
car,'' said Peter Rossin, chairman of Dynamet Inc. in southwestern
Pennsylvania. ``A Honda car made in Ohio doesn't qualify because
the profits derived from that car go back to Japan.''
   ``As I drive to work and park in the lot, I see a lot of foreign
cars,'' he said. ``There are two products where there really is a
major trade imbalance _ petroleum and cars _ and I can't do
anything about petroleum.''
   The offer is on a first-come, first-served basis, and 70 of the
company's 350 employees will be eligible each year, said company
spokesman Stephen Reese. An employee can participate in the plan
once every five years.
   Any employee with at least six months experience at Dynamet can
qualify for the bounty by providing proof of purchase and a copy of
the car's title.
   ``It will be just like submitting an expense account,'' Reese
said.
   The company manufactures titanium and nickel-based alloys for
the aerospace and medical markets at its plants in Washington and
nearby McMurray in suburban Pittsburgh. It also has a plant in
Clearwater, Fla.
   Employees were notified late Wednesday of the incentive plan.
   One shift foreman, Sam Insana, said he planned to shop for a new
pickup truck Thursday night.
   ``I echo the sentiments entirely,'' said Insana, who has worked
at the Washington plant for 10 years. ``My wife will be pleased to
hear about it.''
   Rossin, 66, also sent letters to Chrysler, Ford and General
Motors telling them about his offer.
   The auto companies hadn't received the letters by Thursday, but
General Motors spokesman Ralph Kramer said the incentive isn't
unprecedented.
   ``We occasionally hear about something like this,'' he said.
``From our viewpoint, anything that will prompt a customer to buy a
domestic car can't help but do some good.''
   Frank Joyce, a spokesman for the United Auto Workers, added,
``Most of our members would find that a welcome gesture.''
   Rossin, who drives a Cadillac, said he was hoping his plan ``has
a snowball effect and that other companies will participate. We get
enough companies involved and we might make a dent in the trade
imbalance.
   ``I'm just a big believer in America and I hate to see us take a
back seat to anyone.''

<HEAD>Rorer And Rhone-Poulenc Agree To Pursue Merging Pharmaceutical
Businesses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   French chemical giant Rhone-Poulenc SA has
agreed to merge its pharmaceutical business with Rorer Group Inc.
in the latest drug industry deal that seeks to lower research costs
and gain global market reach.
   The two companies announced Thursday that Rhone-Poulenc would
contribute nearly all of its worldwide pharmaceutical operations to
Rorer in exchange for 68 percent of the new company's stock. The
remaining stock would be offered to shareholders in Rorer, which is
best known for its Maalox antacid.
   Analysts estimated the deal would be worth about $3 billion.
   The new company would be one of the world's 10 biggest
pharmaceutical companies in terms of sales and rank No. 2 in
Europe, the companies said.
   ``Rorer will promote our aggressive entry into the two top world
markets, the U.S. and Japan,'' said Jean-Rene Fourtou,
Rhone-Poulenc's chairman and chief executive. ``Second, it moves us
into the top 10 pharmaceutical companies and offers us the
crtitical mass to achieve our long-term expansion plans.''
   Rorer emphasized the companies still need to arrange financing
and the proposed merger needs to win approval from their directors
and stockholders.
   About 75 percent of Rhone-Poulenc is owned by the French
government, according to Rorer spokesman Jeff Richardson.
   Samuel Isaly, a partner in Mehta and Isaly, a stock market
research firm, described the proposed deal as ``an excellent
strategic combination.''
   Rhone-Poulenc is in the top 10 in the European pharmaceutical
market but has no direct marketing in the United States or Japan,
where Rorer has a modest network established.
   ``So in a single stroke, a new pharmaceutical specialty firm is
created with reasonably strong positions in the U.S., Europe and
Japan,'' Isaly said.
   The analyst said, however, that the firms' products are not as
complementary as their geographic markets.
   Rorer's major drugs are cardiovascular, gastroenterology,
hypersensitivity, bone metabolism and plasma products.
Rhone-Poulenc concentrates on cardiovascular, antibiotic,
anti-inflammatory, central nervous system and oncology drugs.
   Rhone-Poulenc would have a majority of the seats on the new
company's board of directors, but Robert E. Cawthorn, Rorer's
chairman and chief executuve, would head the new company.
   Rorer stockholders would get a mix of cash and securities worth
about $73 a share, according to a statement from Rorer.
   Rorer stock closed down 75 cents a share Thursday at $62.87{ in
New York Stock Exchange trading. The deal was announced after the
market closed Thursday.
   The announcement was expected. On Monday, Rorer said it was
negotiating with an unidentifed firm that would acquire 68 percent
of its stock.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday filed suit
in U.S. District Court in New York charging three unidentified
foreign firms and a Swiss investor with trading on Rorer stock
based on inside information about the negotiations.
   Rhone-Poulenc, based in Paris, had an estimated $11 billion in
1989 sales, while Rorer, based in the Philadelphia suburb of Fort
Washington, had sales of more than $1.1 billion.
   As the cost of developing new drugs climbs, the pharmaceutical
industry has been undergoing a rash of mergers, with companies
seeking to gain higher revenues from worldwide markets while
cutting research and development costs through consolidation.
   Last year, Philadelphia-based SmithKline Beckman Corp. merged
with Britain's Beecham Group PLC to form SmithKline Beecham, and
New York-based Brisol Myers Co. acquired Squibb Corp., of
Princeton, N.J., to form Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.
   Rorer officials compared the proposed deal with the merger that
created Marion Merrell Dow last year. Dow Chemical Co. bought a
controlling interest in Marion Labs Inc., a Kansas City, Mo.,
pharmaceutical company, and combined the company with its
pharmaceutical subsidiary, Merrell Dow. A minority interest remains
in public hands, keeping a stock exchange quote for Marion Merrell
Dow.

<HEAD>Analysts: Fourth Quarter Heading Way Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The cost of sales incentives and temporary plant
closings will cut into automakers' profits for the fourth quarter
of 1989 and into this year, analysts predict.
   Seven automotive analysts checked by The Associated Press
forecast dramatic profit drops among the nation's Big Three
automakers in the fourth quarter.
   Chrysler Corp. will earn little or nothing, they said Thursday.
   Fourth-quarter and year-end 1989 earnings statements for General
Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler are due within the next
four weeks, and will show a significant drop from the record $11.21
billion in earnings the companies reported for 1988.
   GM's fourth-quarter 1989 earnings should be between 48 percent
and 58 percent lower than the year before, the analysts said.
Ford's are forecast to be between 40 percent and 44 percent lower
and Chrysler's profits are predicted to be nearly non-existent.
   ``Chrysler could be marginally profitable in the regular
automotive earnings,'' said independent analyst David Healy of New
York. ``But they have a bunch of write-offs possible ... which
could leave the fourth-quarter in the red.''
   Healy and other analysts said the No. 3 automaker's early
retirement and salaried employee severance plans hooked to its $1.5
billion cost-reduction program will cut into earnings.
   GM is likely to report a one-time gain on the sale of some of
its stock in Isuzu Motors Ltd. of Japan, boosting its non-operating
income, the analysts said.
   Overall, production cuts and the cost of buyer incentives to
sell cars and trucks will depress earnings in the quarter, they
said.
   ``I think that the combination of higher incentives and lower
production has basically reduced the industry to the break-even
level,'' Healy said.
   In past quarters, GM and Ford have reported profits buoyed by
earnings overseas, especially in Europe. Chrysler has little
presence outside North America.
   The trend of overseas profits outpacing North American earnings
is likely to continue, the analysts said.
   ``I don't think anybody is going to make money in North
America,'' said Kathleen Heaney of Nikko Securities Co.
International Inc. of New York.
   In addition to incentive and lost-production costs, Big Three
earnings have been dented by increasing popularity of cars made by
Japanese companies in the United States and overseas.
   Last year, for example, the Honda Accord was the best-selling
car in the United States. Nearly 60 percent of those cars were made
at Honda's plant in Marysville, Ohio, and the rest were imported.
   ``The automotive recession in North America is much deeper than
it looks,'' said Scott Merlis of Morgan, Stanley &amp; Co. in New York.
``It has been artificially levitated by rebates.''
   Automakers are reluctant to talk about the cost of rebates but
acknowledge that it can average in the hundreds of dollars for
every vehicle sold. Some dealers have complained that new cars are
priced artificially high to make up for the incentives.
   The companies sometimes charge incentive costs to the quarter in
which the vehicle was built and sometimes to the quarter in which
it was sold. That makes it tough to tell just how much a company is
spending on the consumer lures.
   But no matter when automakers account for the incentives, they
come straight from profits.

<HEAD>Out On A Limb Where It Is Comfortable</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While many fellow economists are contemplating a
soft landing if not a recession for the economy in 1990, Russell
Redenbaugh, an experienced forecaster, is preparing for a soft
takeoff.
   A soft takeoff is a safe one, although perhaps undramatic. It is
not a sudden ascent; its characteristics are moderation,
sustainability, steadiness. It is a positive, reassuring economy.
   In more specific economic terms it means growth of between 2
percent and 3 percent, accompanied by moderation of the extremes
and negatives that marred the 1980s.
   It means lower inflation, lower interest rates, a lower federal
budget deficit. It means more exports and a reduction in the trade
imbalance. It is one accompanied by lower capital gains taxes and
rising returns on capital.
   It is an economic situation that, Redenbaugh says, professional
economists with a negative outlook have ``grossly misread.''
Because they have misread events, he says, they have come to
``patently wrong conclusions.''
   That is, they are talking about economic deterioration, obsessed
with ``a handful of gloomy statistics for specific sectors of the
U.S. economy,'' unable to measure an historic event that he calls
the key indicator.
   To him, the key to the immediate economic future is the freeing
of the Eastern European economies from 40 years of
deindustrialization, a discontinuity that ``the economics
profession ... cannot comprehend.''
   Redenbaugh knows that his forecast puts him way out on a limb,
especially in the conservative business in which he operates, but
he claims to like it there, saying ``I feel comfortable; it's never
crowded.''
   Most economists and investment advisers run in a herd, he says,
adding: ``In this business you must have an aversion to crowds.
Crowds are comfortable, but they never produce good results.''
   Redenbaugh needs results, is measured by them, and expects to
get them as chief strategist for Cooke &amp; Bieler, Inc., a
Philadelphia-based asset management firm for Fortune 500 pension
funds and profit-sharing accounts.
   He believes that recent economic events will produce a real
peace dividend, an immediate expansion of commerce, and a
lengthening investment horizon that, as a consequence, will means
higher price-earnings ratios for stocks.
   He isn't entirely alone in his optimism. Edward Yardeni of
Prudential-Bache is probably as far out on a limb. And the
Conference Board said today that the U.S. economy is rebounding
rather than eroding, with exports leading the way.
   But if you attended a convention of economists almost anywhere
this month you might not be pleased with what you heard. Based on
their published reports, almost any uplifting news would be
balanced off with depressing reminders.
   Redenbaugh believes many professional economists are unable to
deal with changes in Europe because it doesn't fit their
``orthodoxy of using statistical models to explain everything.''
   He contends they want to say something to the effect that
``Three out of the last four times when the Iron Curtain collapsed
the following happened,'' which is, of course, absurd.
   While the suddenness of the collapse of managed economies in
Europe amazed Redenbaugh, he had suggested it might happen,
although more slowly, in a paper one year ago.
   At that time he said economic considerations were dismantling
the Iron Curtain and undermining Communist ideology, and that if
the Soviet Union was to survive it would have to abandon Marxist
economic systems.
   What has since occurred, he says, is now the key factor in
economic forecasting, whether or not it fits the conventional
forecasting models.
   As the 1990s begin, he states, ``it is not the health of the
economy that is questionable, for it is healthy; it is the health
of the economics profession that is questionable.''

<HEAD>Number of Foreign Investments Down, But Value Up In 1988</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreigners spent $58.4 billion on direct
investments in the United States in 1988, up $300 million from
1987, according to government figures.
   The Commerce Department's International Trade Administration
said Thursday it recorded 1,084 foreign direct investments in 1988,
down 18 percent from 1,328 in 1987.
   The agency reported that the values of the 516 transactions it
could identify rose 0.5 percent to $58.4 billion from $58.1 billion
in 1987. It said transaction values for many investments were not
publicly available.
   Foreign direct investment means the direct or indirect ownership
of 10 percent or more of the voting securities of an incorporated
business, an equivalent interest in an unincorporated business or
10 percent or more interest in real property.
   Calling 1988 ``the year of the big deal,'' the Commerce
Department said the transactions included nine valued at more than
$1 billion, with a combined value of $22.1 billion, or 38 percent
of the total.
   Twenty-two other transactions were valued at $500 million or
more each and had a combined total of $32.2 billion, or 55 percent
of the overall total. The department said a record 110 investments
were worth $100 million or more.
   ``As in the past four years, Japan was the source country for
the largest number of transactions,'' the report said. ``More than
46 percent, or 419 transactions, originated in Japan, with 201
identified values totaling $15.1 billion.''
   British investors were second, with 213 transactions including
116 with identified values totaling $15 billion.
   Noting that the major industrialized nations traditionally have
been the source of most direct investment activity, the agency said
Canada, France, West Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland
joined Japan and Britain to make 906 transactions, or 84 percent of
the total. That was down from 87 percent of the 1987 total.
   Still, ``the identified aggregate value of the transactions by
the seven countries _ $51.2 billion _ represented 88 percent of the
total identified value,'' it said.
   The Commerce Department said nearly 53 percent of the investment
transactions were in manufacturing, primarily in non-electrical
machinery, electric and electronic equipment, chemicals, printing
and publishing and transportation equipment.
   ``The services and the real estate sectors also attracted large
numbers of foreign investors,'' the report said.

<HEAD>Consumer Group Seeking Investigation of AT&amp;T Outage</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   A consumer group is asking federal regulators
to make sure this week's major outage in AT&amp;T long distance service
wasn't the result of profit motives getting in the way of quality.
   The Consumer Federation of America said Thursday it would ask
the Federal Communications Commission today to investigate what
happened on Monday, why the outage lasted for nine hours and why
AT&amp;T wasn't better prepared to handle it.
   Gene Kimmelman, the federation's legislative director, said he
was concerned that AT&amp;T may be cutting corners under new FCC
regulations that let the company earn whatever profits it can
within a ``price cap'' formula that limits yearly price increases.
   ``In moving to this new form of relaxed regulation with no limit
on profits, AT&amp;T may have reconfigured its network, cutting corners
on quality to try to boost its profits,'' Kimmelman said.
   An American Telephone and Telegraph Co. spokesman labeled
Kimmelman's allegations ``utterly ridiculous.''
   The federation's announcement came shortly after AT&amp;T said it
will give its customers nine hours of discount calling on Feb. 14,
Valentine's Day, if the FCC approves.
   AT&amp;T said it was trying to make amends for Monday's nine-hour
outage in which millions of customers got busy signals and failed
connections when they tried to use AT&amp;T long distance service. The
company blamed a computer software problem that spread from New
York to more than 100 switching centers nationwide.
   AT&amp;T, which has about 80 million customers, also said it would
compensate its ``800'' service businesses, and negotiate one-on-one
with all its business customers for possible additional concessions.
   But the consumer group complained that AT&amp;T was offering its
discounts _ averaging 33 percent _ on Valentine's Day between 8
a.m. and 5 p.m. That mainly would benefit business, the federation
said, claiming that most residential customers do their long
distance calling during evening and nighttime hours.
   In a letter being delivered today, Kimmelman asked the FCC to
investigate the outage or review the monitoring standards that were
adopted when price caps went into effect in July.
   ``We find it difficult to understand how the network breakdown _
whatever its initial cause _ could have spread so far, and resulted
in so much of AT&amp;T's service being disrupted for so long,''
Kimmelman wrote.
   AT&amp;T spokesman Herb Linnen said the consumer group's claims were
ridiculous and noted his company's ``longstanding commitment to
quality service over more than a century.''
   He disputed Kimmelman's statement that residential customers
make most long distance calls in the evenings and at night.
   ``The bulk of all long distance calls are made by residential
customers, regardless of time of day ... and therefore lower
daytime prices benefit both residential and business customers,''
Linnen said.
   AT&amp;T Chairman Robert E. Allen said his company was offering the
Valentine's Day discounts as a ``gesture to underscore how much we
value our relationship with our customers, knowing there is no way
to make up for the inconvenience they may have experienced.''
   If the FCC approves AT&amp;T's request, the company's residential,
business and international customers would be charged an average 33
percent less than regular weekday charges on out-of-state,
direct-dialed calls placed during the day.
   AT&amp;T, which carries 70 percent of the nation's long-distance
calls, said a 10-minute, direct-dialed, coast-to-coast call between
8 a.m. and 5 p.m. on Valentine's Day would cost $1.58, compared
with $2.50 on a normal weekday.
   The discounts also will apply to credit card calls and ``800''
service calls, but not to operator-assisted calls or to calls
placed before 8 a.m. or after 5 p.m., which already are discounted,
Linnen said.
   The company said ``800'' service customers will be eligible to
receive a credit on their bills up to the monthly service charge.

<HEAD>Ag Department Sees Taiwan as Biggest Growing Market for American
Produce</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also on general news wires.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The No. 1 export growth market for American
farmers over the next few years won't be the Soviet Union, China or
even Japan, says the Agriculture Department. It will be Taiwan.
   A new study by the department's Foreign Agricultural Service
puts Taiwan at top of a 10-nation listing of prime opportunities
for U.S. agricultural exports.
   The others, in order, are: South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, Egypt,
Pakistan, Iraq, Singapore, the Soviet Union and Turkey. China was a
near-miss, coming in 11th.
   Mike Dwyer of the department's Foreign Agricultural Service said
a number of variable factors were considered in a computer model
used to analyze 80 countries as U.S. agricultural customers and
project growths over the next three to five years.
   Some of the factors were related to trade performance, including
growth in imports from the United States going back to 1980. Other
``macroeconomic'' variables such as debt-and-service ratios,
population trends and per capita incomes were considered.
   Dwyer, reporting in a forthcoming issue of AgExporter magazine,
noted of the 10 top potential markets, nine are developing
countries, with Japan the exception.
   Also, he said, most of the others are in the Middle East and the
Far East, with an emphasis on ``newly industrialized countries'' of
Asia _ Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong.
   Looking at U.S. agricultural exports in the 1986-88 period,
Dwyer said Taiwan was the sixth largest market, importing an
average of $1.36 billion worth of products annually. South Korea
was third at $1.8 billion, while Japan was the biggest at $6.1
billion.
   ``While these are all quite large, our study suggests there is a
lot of room for further growth,'' he said.
   The 12-nation European Economic community as a bloc is one of
the biggest markets for American farmers. For example, in the 1989
fiscal year that ended last Sept. 30, when U.S. farm exports
totaled $39.7 billion, the EEC accounted for $6.5 billion, topped
only by Japan at $8.2 billion.
   But Dwyer said the EEC didn't show great growth potential in the
study.
   ``Despite the weaker dollar, (EEC) nations have been declining
markets for the United States in recent years,'' he said. ``It will
probably become more difficult to export bulk commodities there
because (the region) already has become or is becoming
self-sufficient in many of these products.''
   Some of the best-growth markets, including Iraq, Egypt and
Pakistan, show up well because of projected population growth, U.S.
food aid, credit and subsidized prices, Dwyer said.
   In the ninth-ranked Soviet Union, growth potential based purely
on numbers is ``very good'' over the next few years, he said.
   ``Add to that the changes taking place in the political
environment there, and that market could really expand for the
United States,'' Dwyer said. ``The agricultural sector is unable to
keep pace with demand, and consumers are dissatisfied with the lack
of food on grocery shelves.''
   Dwyer added the Kremlin is aware of the problems and is
interested in restructuring the Soviet food system. The move toward
free-market practices ``could create opportunities for diversities
in Soviet imports.''
   China, with more than one billion people and its political
turmoil, is difficult to gauge but stacks up as a favorable growth
market for the United States, he said.
   ``Prior to 1981, China was a hot import market,'' Dwyer said.
``Then, the realization hit that it couldn't continue to import at
the rate it was without incurring massive foreign debt. So China
pulled back and imports fell 13 percent a year during 1981-87.''
   As a result, China's imports of U.S. products dropped an average
of 28 percent a year during the 1980-88 period, he said.
   ``There has a been a comeback in U.S. exports (to China) this
past year, but the market is considered volatile,'' Dwyer said.

   After buying wheat recently, the Soviet Union
is adding soybean meal to its U.S. shopping list.
   The Agriculture Department said Thursday that private exporters
sold 100,000 metric tons of meal to the Soviets for delivery by
Sept. 30 under a long-term grain agreement between the two
countries.
   The current pact began its seventh year on Oct. 1 and will
expire on Dec. 31. Negotiations on a new agreement are scheduled to
resume March 21-22 in Vienna.
   Most sales have been grain, including about 11 million tons of
corn and more than 2.2 million tons of wheat for delivery during
the seventh year. Sales of soybean meal now total 895,000 tons for
1989-90 delivery; soybeans, 217,900 tons; and barley, 7,300 tons.
   All of the wheat, including 525,000 tons announced earlier in
the week, has been sold at prices subsidized under the department's
Export Enhancement Program. Only wheat is approved for sale to
Moscow under the subsidy program.
   The new sales were made by unidentified private exporting
companies, which are required to report large sales to the
department. No selling prices or further details were released.
   Meal prices at processors have been around $180 per ton of 2,000
pounds each, according to USDA market reports. A metric ton is
about 2,205 pounds, indicating a value of about $198 per metric
ton, or a total estimate of around $19.8 million.

<HEAD>Cigna To Acquire Nashville Insurer for $777 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cigna Corp. has signed a definitive
agreement to acquire Equicor-Equitable HCA Corp. in a $777 million
deal that would make Cigna the nation's largest health insurer for
employers.
   Cigna on Thursday said it would purchase the Nashville-based
company, which sells health insurance, in a cash transaction.
   Once the deal is completed, Cigna would serve more than 12
million people with traditional health insurance operations and
nearly 2 million more through health maintenance organizations.
   Equicor is a joint venture owned by the Equitable Life Assurance
Society of the United States and Hospital Corporation of America.
It is the sixth-largest group health insurer, based on $5.5 billion
in premiums and fees for administering employers' own health
insurance plans in 1988.
   Wilson H. Taylor, Cigna chairman and chief executive officer,
said the aquisition would result in the elimination of some jobs
because of duplication of effort, but the company hasn't determined
yet how many or which jobs would be lost.
   Taylor said Cigna is buying Equicor because ``Cigna is committed
to establishing a leading position in the managed health care
business.''
   Managed care refers to health maintenance organizations and
other networks of health care providers aimed at restraining the
soaring costs of care.
   ``The timing for growth couldn't be any better'' because of
employers' increasing desire to limit rising costs of employee
health care,'' he said.
   Analysts said the plan was a good one for Cigna.
   ``I think it is a brilliant strategic move because size and
critical mass have become the key strategic variable in the group
health business,'' said G. Alan Zimmerman, a vice president at
Smith, Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. ``You have to get bigger in order
to negotiate effectively with employers.''
   Cigna already has the largest for-profit chain of HMOs in the
nation, bringing in $1.5 billion of revenues in 1988, compared with
Equicor's $300 million in revenue.
   The acquisition will increase Cigna's HMO membership by about 30
percent. Cigna has 1.5 million HMO members in 31 sites across the
nation, and Equicor has 450,000 in 19 sites.
   Cigna has yet to report financial results for 1989, but Taylor
said its HMO operations lost money. They are expected to post a
profit this year, he said.
   Equicor's HMO operaton, with some HMOs relatively new, are
incurring ``modest losses'' overall, Taylor said.
   Equicor has 7,300 employees in about 80 offices nationwide.
   The acquisition, which is subject to regulatory approval, should
be completed in six months, officials said.

<HEAD>Publisher Denies Plans to File For Bankruptcy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Heavily indebted publisher Harcourt Brace
Jovanovich Inc. denied rumors it plans to file for bankruptcy after
the company's stock plummeted to an all-time low.
   HBJ stock, which changed hands at nearly $10 a share just three
months ago, traded as low as $2 Thursday before closing at $2.875,
down 12.5 cents on the New York Stock Exchange.
   HBJ ``is not a candidate for Chapter 11'' bankruptcy protection,
William Jovanovich, the company's reclusive chairman, said in a
statement released after the market closed.
   Jovanovich said the rumors were sparked by the highly publicized
problems of other indebted companies, an apparent reference to
bankruptcy filings Monday by Campeau Corp.'s Allied Stores Corp.
and Federated Department Stores Inc.
   Jovanovich made his statement to the Dow Jones Professional
Investor Report after the Orlando-based company tried to calm
market jitters with another statement early in the afternoon.
   Huge sales of HBJ stock early in the day fueled speculation
surrounding the publisher. Volume totaled 4.8 million shares,
making it the most active issue on the Big Board.
   After the stock hit its low point, the company issued its first
statement saying that operating income and cash flow in 1990 would
be ``significantly higher'' than what HBJ will post for 1989.
   HBJ is not due to release 1989 earnings until February or March.
In 1988, the company posted a loss of $126.5 million because of
high interest payments associated with its debt.
   HBJ has about $1.6 billion in junk bonds outstanding. The
company borrowed nearly $3 billion as part of a frantic
recapitalization 2{ years ago to repel a hostile takeover bid by
British publisher Robert Maxwell.
   Last year, HBJ sold its six theme parks to Anheuser-Busch Cos.
for $1.1 billion in an effort to pare its debt.

   Britain's inflation rate rose 0.3 percent in
December and was up 7.7 percent for the year, the government said
Friday.
   The Central Statistical Office attributed the December rise in
the Retail Price Index to sharp increases in food prices,
particularly for fresh fruit and vegetables. The index also
reflected higher housing costs, the government said.
   The rate was better than the 7.8 percent increase the financial
markets had been expecting and was good news for the government,
which has been fighting resurgent inflation with 15 percent
interest rates.
   The index, which uses a January 1987 base of 100, stood at 118.8
in December, compared with 118.5 in November and 110.3 in December
1988.
   Excluding mortgage interest payments, retail prices rose 6.1
percent in December from the previous year. This is the same rate
of increase as November's and October's year-over-year rises.

   A group of West Point-Pepperell Inc. stockholders
has filed a federal lawsuit charging that Farley Inc.
misrepresented its takeover of their Georgia textile company.
   The lawsuit, filed Thursday on behalf of a group said to own
46,800 Pepperell common shares, followed reports that Chicago-based
Farley Inc. was having trouble securing financing for the buyout.
   Farley agreed last year to acquire sheet-and-towel maker
Pepperell for $3 billion.
   In a brief statement, Farley denied than any of its ``tender
offer materials or other disclosures were not complete or accurate
disclosures at the time they were made.''
   Farley said the suit, which names its founder, industrialist
William Farley and unidentified Pepperell officials as defendants,
is ``without merit'' and it plans to ``vigorously contest the
plantiffs in court.''
   Farley's acquisition of Pepperell, based in West Point, Ga., was
said to create the world's largest textile and apparel group, with
more than $4 billion in sales and about 70,000 employees.
   Farley's best-known holding is Fruit of the Loom underwear.

<HEAD>Japan's Trade Surplus Narrows for Eighth Consecutive Month</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Increasing consumption and growing imports pushed
Japan's trade surplus lower in December for the eighth consecutive
monthly decline from year-earlier levels, the Finance Ministry said
Friday.
   The trade surplus, calculated on a customs-clearance basis,
shrank 36.3 percent to $6.19 billion from a year earlier, when it
registered $9.72 billion, the ministry said.
   The trade account for all of 1989 was in surplus by $64.43
billion, compared with $77.56 billion in 1988. A breakdown by
nations or regions was not available.
   Ministry officials attributed the paring of the trade surplus to
increasing personal consumption and high import growth. In
December, they said, high oil prices also pushed up the value of
imports.
   In December, exports totaled $24.59 billion, off 6 percent from
a year earlier, while imports were up 11.8 percent at $18.40
billion.
   Monthly trade surplus with the United States dropped 24 percent
to $3.83 billion, the report said.
   Japan's trade surplus has been a target of sharp criticism from
the United States and other trading partners throughout the 1980s.

<TEXT>
   Nancy Evans has resigned after three years as
president and publisher of Doubleday, and will be replaced by
Stephen Rubin, publisher and editor in chief for adult fiction and
non-fiction at Bantam Books.
   Ms. Evans, a former editor in chief of Book-of-the-Month Club
for what now is Time Warner Inc., was credited with revitalizing
Doubleday, a leading publisher of general interest books, in the
wake of its acquisition in late 1986 by Bertelsmann AG of West
Germany.
   The announcements of the changes were made Thursday.
   Doubleday and Bantam Books are operated along with Dell as
separate divisions within Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group
Inc., which itself is second in size only to Random House among the
nation's general interest book publishers.
   Ms. Evans was unavailable to comment on her resignation.
   Her departure comes two months after Alberto Vitale left as
president and chief executive of Bantam Doubleday Dell to replace
Robert L. Bernstein as head of Random House. Bernstein resigned
unexpectedly in early November after 23 years as head of Random
House.
   Industry analysts said they suspected Vitale's selection at
Random House reflected concern with improving profitability.
Industrywide sales have slumped in recent months and competition
has grown keener.
   The changes at Bantam Doubleday Dell were announced by Berhard
von Minckwitz, interim chief executive officer and co-chairman of
the group, and Jack Hoeft, president and chief operating officer.
   ``During her three years as president, Doubleday regained its
stature as a leading hardcover house, focused upon the publication
of books whose editorial integrity is matched by the quality of
their physical production,'' they said.
   But they said that with this phase of Doubleday's rebuilding in
hand, they and Ms. Evans decided it was an opportune time for Ms.
Evans to move on ``to pursue the many possibilities that await her
in the communications field.''
   ``She will announce her plans shortly,'' the statement read.
   Ms. Evans had been editor in chief and vice president of
Book-of-the-Month Club from January 1985 to January 1987 and
previously hosted an author interview television program.
   Among recent Doubleday titles have been ``Drive'' by basketball
star Larry Bird and ``Confessions of an S.O.B.'' by former Gannett
Co. Inc. chairman Al Neuharth.
   The trade newsletter BP Report, based in Wilton, Conn.,
estimated that Bantam Doubleday Dell had revenue of $550 million in
1988, second only to Random House's estimated $800 million, among
general interest publishers.
   Rubin, 48, joined Bantam in May 1984 as executive editor. He
became editorial director for adult fiction and non-fiction in
February 1985, was elected vice president six months later and
editor in chief in January 1987.
   He became publisher and a Bantam senior vice president in July
1988.
   Von Minckwitz and Hoeft said in a memo to the staff that Rubin
``is unwaveringly committed, as are we, to an editorially
independent Doubleday offering a full-range publishing program of
hardcover and trade paperback fiction and non-fiction for adults
and young readers.''
   At Bantam Books, Jeff Stone was named to the newly-created
position of vice president and publisher, adult hardcover and trade
paperback books. He had been vice president and associate publisher
of Alfred A. Knopf Inc. and vice president of Vintage Books, a
trade paperback imprint of Random House Inc.
   Last November, Lou Aronica was appointed vice president and
publisher, mass market books, for Bantam's mass market paperbacks.
   Both Stone and Aronica report to Bantam's president and
publisher, Linda Grey.

   On Karsten Mahlmann's calendar, the new year
began Jan. 1 but it took a little longer for the Chicago Board of
Trade chairman to put 1989 behind him.
   Not until this past Wednesday, when he won a close election to a
fourth consecutive one-year term, was Mahlmann certain of majority
support among the 3,500 members of the world's oldest and largest
commodity futures exchange.
   It was a vote of confidence after a year of scandal that began
Jan. 19, 1989, when federal authorities revealed a sweeping
investigation of trading fraud at the Board of the Trade and the
smaller Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which together account for
about 75 percent of U.S. futures trading volume.
   ``I can't remember a tougher year in the seven years I've served
on the board,'' Mahlmann said in an interview.
   The probe has resulted in criminal charges against 48 people.
Fourteen have pleaded guilty to swindling customers.
   A parallel investigation at New York's four major futures
exchanges was revealed in May but has yielded no indictments yet.
   The Board of Trade's troubles multiplied in July when exchange
directors exercised their seldom-used authority to order traders to
sell soybean futures, forcing prices lower. The board claimed it
was necessary to prevent one grain company from cornering the
market.
   The trading-fraud scandal brought cries for reform of the
rapidly growing futures industry and has delayed congressional
reauthorization of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the
federal agency that regulates the futures pits. Futures contracts
are agreements to buy or sell commodities ranging from agricultural
products to financial instruments on some future date at a price
agreed upon in advance. People trade futures to hedge losses or
speculate on future prices.
   Amid the intense public scrutiny of the futures markets and
their trading practices in the past year, the Chicago exchanges
have strengthened policing efforts, stiffened penalties for
cheating and proposed reforms that address some concerns raised by
the FBI investigation.
   But the toughest measures, such as restrictions on dual trading
and stricter regulation of broker associations, are yet to come.
   Dual trading is the practice among floor brokers of trading for
their own accounts as well as customer accounts. Broker
associations are groups of independent futures traders who share
revenues and pool expenses.
   Critics say both practices provide opportunities for traders to
defraud customers.
   ``A lot needs to be done,'' said Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla.
``If you review what's actually been done, we've had a good deal
more in terms of intentions expressed rather than real action.''
   English sponsored a CFTC reauthorization bill passed last year
by the House. The measure would sharply curtail dual trading until
an exchange demonstrates an ability to better detect wrongdoing.
   Senate action on a similar bill is pending.
   The CFTC, meanwhile, is seeking public comment on a proposed
rule that would limit dual trading but it's not as tough as the
bills in Congress.
   The Chicago exchanges defend dual trading as a means of keeping
markets liquid when the customer order flow is light, thus reducing
price volatility. They bristled when curbs on dual trading were
first suggested, but have since indicated acceptance of
restrictions that would be lifted when highly accurate
trade-auditing systems are in place.
   The Board of Trade and Merc are involved in a rare joint effort
to develop a hand-held electronic trade-recording device. The
machine would replace the traditional paper cards on which
commodity traders pencil in their trades.
   The electronic trading cards and would zap the information to
exchange computers, theoretically creating a complete,
instantaneous record of all trades.
   The exchanges have invited proposals for companies to design an
electronic trading card and hope to begin testing prototypes on
their trading floors this fall.
   ``It will make detection of abuses a certainty,'' said Merc
spokesman Andrew Yemma.
   But some critics contend commodities fraud will remain difficult
to detect until the exchanges do away with open-outcry trading, a
140-year-old tradition in which traders crowd pits and strike deals
through a seemingly chaotic combination of hand signals and shouted
bids and offers.
   ``Verbal orders, executed by shakes, winks, hand gestures, spit
and God-knows what, that's the window of opportunity for fraud,''
said former Sen. Thomas Eagleton, who quit the Chicago Merc's board
of governors in November. He accused the exchange of trying to
protect a former chairman accused of failing to stop two of his
employees from defrauding investors.
   The Board of Trade and the Merc are working on electronic
trading systems to supplement open-outcry trading, but neither
exchange plans to phase out the practice, saying it creates the
world's most efficient markets.
   The futures industry has enjoyed remarkable growth since the
early 1970s, when financial futures were introduced. Volume has
soared from 13.8 million contracts traded in 1970 to 267.4 million
last year.
   Last year's industry-wide volume increase of 8.8 percent marked
the 21st consecutive annual rise.
   The Board of Trade's trading volume fell 3.3 percent last year,
though. Exchange officials blamed it on quieter agricultural
markets than in 1988, a drought year.
   But John Damgard, president of the Futures Industry Association
trade group, said industry-wide volume probably would have been
higher if it weren't for the fraud scandal.
   ``There's clearly been a price to pay for this,'' he said, ``and
the Chicago exchanges are right at the focal point.''

   Stock prices headed higher today in what
analysts described as a technical rally after the market's recent
declines.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 5.12 to 2,671.50 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 637 up, 298
down and 478 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 25.57 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Stock prices began to stabilize late in Thursday's session, when
buying of blue chips enabled the market to finish mixed after a
broad early retreat.
   Analysts said traders' spirits brightened this morning as
interest rates dropped back a bit after their steady rise of the
past few weeks in the bond market.
   But considerable skepticism lingered on the Street about the
staying power of any rally attempt.
   Corporate earnings reports issued to date for the fourth quarter
of 1989 have contained some even bigger disappointments than
traders were expecting. In addition, rising interest rates in
Japan, West Germany and other industrialized countries have
intensified speculation about the possibility of an international
business slump in the months ahead.
   Digital Equipment dropped 1 to 81 on top of a 5~-point loss
Thursday, when the company posted a quarterly earnings decline that
was sharper than many observers had expected.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.41 to 187.48. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .05 at 366.22.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 7.25 to
2,666.38.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 3 to 2 on the
NYSE, with 587 up, 879 down and 501 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 178.59 million shares, against 170.47
million in the previous session.

<HEAD>Windham Hill Records Reportedly for Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Windham Hill Records, founding distributor of
New Age music, is listening to buyout offers while hoping for a
reported $50 million sale price.
   Anne Robinson, Windham Hill's president and chief executive,
said her company discussed deals with several potential buyers in
recent weeks, but would not elaborate, the Los Angeles Times
reported Friday.
   ``Our distribution agreement with A&amp;M Records expires at the end
of March,'' Ms. Robinson said.
   ``We have been approached by a number of parties interested in
either distribution (of our records) or acquisition of our company.
I can't say more than that.''
   Capitol Records is among those talking with the Palo Alto-based
record company, the newspaper said, citing unnamed music industry
sources who said the asking price was about $50 million.
   Capitol officials declined formal comment on the report.
   Windham Hill's possible sale follows a recent wave of record
company buyouts by larger media companies. Polygram last fall
acquired Windham Hill's distributor, A&amp;M Records, for about $500
million.
   Windham Hill pioneered the recording of New Age music 14 years
ago, with unorthodox marketing methods like mail-order sales and
distribution through bookstores.
   The New Age music is mostly instrumental and has been described
as a mix of classical piano, jazz and natural sounds such as wind
and running water.
   Billboard magazine in 1988 formally recognized New Age music by
ranking releases in a separate category. There are now about a half
dozen major New Age record companies.

<HEAD>Fate of Campeau Corp. Bonds Unknown, But Few Small Investors Hurt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The bankruptcy filing of Campeau Corp.'s U.S.
department store divisions last week came as no surprise to the
bond market, and few small investors should be hurt by the damage
done to the Campeau divisions' bonds.
   Not many individual investors are believed to own bonds issued
by Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp., except
indirectly through mutual funds.
   ``Most of it was sophisticated investors, big investors,'' said
Pam Stubing, an analyst for Moody's Investors Service Inc.
   Even investors in junk-bond mutual funds that hold Allied and
Federated bonds should not see the value of these funds hurt by the
Chapter 11 filing of the department stores. That's because the
funds typically have less than 1 percent of their assets in any
single bond issue.
   For example, far less than 1 percent of T. Rowe Price's
high-income, or junk-bond, fund consists of bonds from Allied and
Federated, said Jane Nelson, a spokeswoman for the big
Baltimore-based mutual fund operator.
   Neither Price nor Fidelity Investments, another major mutual
fund sponsor, reported much concern from investors in their
junk-bond funds over the bankruptcy filing.
   ``People sort of knew what was going to happen. It's not as
though it was a surprise out of the blue,'' said Tracy Gordon, a
spokeswoman for Boston-based Fidelity.
   The impact of the filing was muted further by the fact that
these bonds have been trading far below their issue price for
months due to concern over Campeau's troubled finances.
   In fact, many of the bonds have been trading at one-tenth of the
price they sold for originally. Because of that and the assumption
by many that a bankruptcy reorganization was a foregone conclusion,
the price of the bonds was little affected by the actual filing.
   However, the bonds began trading on a ``flat'' basis after the
filing. When bonds trade flat, a seller does not receive any of the
accumulated interest from the buyer.
   Bonds typically pay interest only twice a year. Because of this,
if a bond is purchased, for example, three months after its last
interest payment, the purchaser would have to pay the seller
prorated interest.
   When a bond trades flat it indicates investors don't expect to
see any interest payments.
   It appears the biggest losers from the Allied and Federated
filings could be the institutional investors and investment houses
that bought large blocks of the bonds.
   Among the major creditors listed in the bankruptcy papers were
First Boston Corp., State Street Bank, Manufacturers Hanover bank
and PaineWebber Inc.
   The par, or face, value of Allied's publicly traded debt
securities totals about $1.2 billion, while the figure for
Federated is about $2 billion, said Ms. Stubing, the Moody's
analyst. However, the actual worth of these issues is far less
because they are trading below their issue price.
   Ms. Stubing said she believes the Allied and Federated
bondholders will see some return for their investment despite the
fact the divisions are nearly $8 billion in debt.
   ``I'm reasonably optimistic that they will get something for
their pain and effort,'' she said. ``After all, the stores are not
to blame in this thing, the debt is to blame.''
   But things won't be smooth during the reorganization, which
could take more than a year, she said.
   ``It's going to be a very complex thing. There're a lot of
entities involved and a lot of cross-ownership between Allied and
Federated.''

<HEAD>Three Charged with Breaking into Classified Military Computer</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also on general news wires.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three men have been accused of breaking
into a government computer and obtaining a classified military
secret, an act a federal prosecutor says shows the nation's defense
computers are vulnerable.
   The three Silicon Valley computer workers, Kevin L. Poulsen, 24,
Mark K. Lottor, 25, and Robert E. Gilligan, 31, are accused of
using personal computers, stolen Pacific Bell Telephone Co.
equipment and stolen access codes to tap into government and
telephone computer computers and obtain classified military
documents and FBI information on associates of the late Philippine
President Ferdinand Marcos.
   Peter G. Neumann, a computer security expert at SRI
International, a computer consulting company, said this was the
first case he knew of in which classified information was allegedly
obtained by computer break-ins.
   The federal indictment, unsealed Wednesday in U.S. District
Court in San Jose, is one of the first in the nation to use federal
criminal statutes directed at computer crime, assistant U.S.
Attorney Robert K. Crowe said on Thursday.
   U.S. Attorney Joseph Russoniello said at a news conference in
San Francisco Thursday that the military secret, which concerned a
military exercise at Fort Bragg, N.C., was classified at the time
it was stolen in 1987 or 1988 but has since been declassified.
   The act ``does signal a vulnerability'' in the defense system
computers, he said.
   All three men are current or former employees of Sun
Microsystems in Mountain View or of SRI International in Menlo Park.
   According to the indictment, Poulsen used common burglary tools,
including surgical gloves, powdered graphite and lock picks, and
forged a Pacific Bell employee card to steal the telecommunications
equipment and access codes from offices in San Francisco and San
Ramon, in Contra Costa County.
   Poulsen and Lottor ran part of the alleged conspiracy from the
Menlo Park apartment they once shared, Crowe said.
   Gilligan and Poulsen are accused of trafficking in codes that
allow access to U.S. government computers through electronic mail,
the 15-page indictment said.
   The charges said the computer entered by two of the men was the
Army MASNET Computer Network, used exclusively by the government.
The charges do not indicate the uses of the computer.
   Poulsen also is charged with burglarizing Pacific Bell sites to
steal the access codes, and with manufacturing fake identification
badges to gain private computer information.
   The indictment also accuses Poulsen of using his computer
knowledge to obstruct the investigation into his alleged activities.
   Gilligan, who reportedly still works for Sun, and Lottor, who
works for SRI, are expected to surrender voluntarily. Poulsen, a
former employee of both companies, remained at large.
   If convicted, Lottor and Gilligan face up to 20 years in prison
and fines of $30,000. Poulsen could be sentenced to 37 years in
prison and a $50,000 fine.
   The indictment does not indicate when authorities began
investigating the three, or what the men intended to do with the
military secrets.

<HEAD>Wheat Futures Slide Further In Storm Reaction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat futures prices fell moderately in early
trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, steepening a decline
linked to heavy precipitation in the nation's winter wheat region.
   Wheat futures fell to 3{-month lows Thursday as an intense
winter storm dumped snow and rain across a large portion of the
Southern Plains, where moisture was badly needed for the winter
wheat crop.
   The storm system responsible for the moisture was moving from
the Southwest into the central United States today and should help
replenish soil moisture in corn and soybean areas, analysts said.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1 cent to 2{ cents lower
with the contract for delivery in March at $3.95} a bushel; corn
was \ cent to 1 cent lower with March at $2.41} a bushel; oats were
\ cent to 1\ cents higher with March at $1.39{ a bushel; soybeans
were unchanged to 1 cent lower with January at $5.60 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .13 cent lower with February at
78.80 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .17 cent lower to .05 cent
higher with January at 83.75 cents a pound; hog futures were .30
cent lower to .20 cent higher with February at 49.35 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .25 cent lower to .18 cent higher with
February at 55.27 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mixed on Thursday.

<TEXT>
   Less than two months after settling a strike
triggered in part by mandatory overtime for production workers,
Boeing Co. said it expects to cut its Seattle-area work force by as
many as 5,000 people.
   The aerospace giant said it needed to shed workers because it
had completed start-up work on its newest generation jumbo jet and
because warmer East-West ties had cast doubt on the outlook for its
defense business.
   Boeing said it hoped to achieve half the cuts through
retirements and resignations, but company officials hinted that
further layoffs could be possible.
   About 1,700 hourly workers are to be laid off through April with
another 800 later in the year, the company said Thursday.
   The Martin Marietta Astronautics Group also announced plans
Thursday to cut about 200 jobs by the end of February, but will
transfer many workers to other posts within the aerospace giant, a
company spokeswoman said in Denver.
   The job losses come as Boeing enjoys a record backlog of more
than 1,700 commercial jets worth about $85 billion, with deliveries
scheduled beyond the turn of the century.
   Last year, the company added 10,000 employees in the Puget Sound
area and was so strapped for production workers it borrowed 600
machinists from Lockheed. The company also required workers to put
in heavy overtime schedules, which became a major factor in the
48-day strike by machinists that ended in November.
   The Lockheed workers were needed on the new 747-400 jumbo jet,
which fell behind schedule as the company introduced four different
versions of the long-range jetliner in 1989.
   The extra workers are no longer needed because startup and
certification work on the new jumbo has been completed, Boeing said.
   About 1,400 hourly employees are expected to be laid off at the
company's Everett plant north of Seattle, where widebody 747s and
767s are built. Most of the other layoffs are expected to be at
defense plants, Boeing spokesman Paul Binder said.
   In interviews last month, Boeing Chairman Frank Shrontz said the
company anticipated some layoffs.
   Boeing recently announced it wants to build a new widebody jet,
the 777, but no orders have been announced and production startup
is at least two years away.
   ``Because the new 777 airplane program is still not formally
approved and with uncertainties in the defense budget, Boeing will
continue to review and revise its work force requirements
throughout the year,'' the company said.
   Binder said Boeing thought last fall it could absorb most of the
commercial airplane job reductions by transferring people into
defense programs.
   But with the opening of the Berlin Wall and the fall of
Communist regimes in Eastern Europe late in the year, many U.S.
defense programs have come under question.
   ``Some are going to be stretched, some cut, some shortened,''
Binder said. ``The requirements of the defense sector just went
away.''
   Boeing is a major subcontractor to Northrop on the B-2 stealth
bomber, a program already slowed by defense cutbacks. It also holds
contracts for the small ICBM mobile launcher, the V-22
helicopter-plane and the space station and is competing for the Air
Force's multi-billion dollar Advanced Tactical Fighter contract,
all programs under close congressional scrutiny.
   Overall, Boeing's defense segments have been losing money and
were consolidated at the first of the year into Boeing Defense &amp;
Aerospace Group. The company trimmed 800 jobs as part of the
consolidation but most of those people found jobs elsewhere in the
company.
   The division's president, B. Dan Pinick, has said he wants to
cut overhead by $100 million, which could entail the loss of some
jobs.
   Thursday's announcement made no mention of any job losses at
Boeing plants outside the Puget Sound region. Binder said he did
not have employment projections for company divisions elsewhere in
the country.
   Layoff notices will be issued Friday to about 1,900 employees
who might be among the 1,700 workers laid off starting March 20,
the company said. It said it will provide counseling and help
laid-off workers find new jobs.
   At the end of 1989, Boeing had just under 106,700 employees in
Washington state, an increase of almost 10,000 from the beginning
of the year.
   Nationwide, Boeing employment grew by 10,800 last year to
145,200.

   As Congress moves toward enacting tougher air
pollution controls, one of the biggest mysteries is how much it
will cost. Figures range from $14 billion a year to more than $100
billion, and some argue that doing nothing may be most expensive of
all.
   The nation's largest corporations unveiled a study Thursday
suggesting that if some of the most stringent proposals for
cleaning up the air are enacted, the cost of compliance could soar
as high as $104 billion a year.
   The actual costs likely will be less, conceded Philip
Masciantonio, a vice president at U.S. Steel, a subsidiary of USX
Corp., but he added even the study's $54 billion ``best estimate''
could be devastating to some industries.
   The steel industry's coke ovens could be shut down by toxic
chemical emission controls envisioned by a Senate clean air bill,
he argued.
   The study by the Business Roundtable, an association of the
heads of the 200 largest corporations, was the latest estimate of
how much the tighter air pollution controls now before Congress
will cost business _ and their customers _ and how they might
affect the economy.
   But supporters of the tough pollution controls argue inaction
has a price tag of its own.
   A study released today by the American Lung Association
maintained that current air pollution from automobiles may be
costing Americans up to $93 billion a year in added health care
expenses. Many of these costs would be eliminated under the
pollution curbs being considered in Congress, the report said.
   At a news conference, the authors of the study said that while
the $93 billion represents a ``high range'' they are confident from
available data that health costs from breathing today's dirty air
is costing society at least $40 billion to $50 billion, about half
of that from automobile pollution.
   ``Five years ago the high-range estimate ....was $40 billion a
year. Today $40 billion has become the best estimate for mid-range
of the health costs'' associated to air pollution, said Fran
DuMelle, director of government relations for the American Lung
Association.
   President Bush has estimated that his proposal _ similar to
legislation advancing in the House _ would cost from $14 billion to
$19 billion a year. He urged Congress on Thursday to ``preserve the
careful balance'' between cleaning up the air and preserving jobs.
   Democratic sponsors of a Senate clean air bill, expected to be
brought to the floor next week, say it is not much more expensive
than the president's version. But the Bush administration disagrees
and opposes key provisions of it as being too costly.
   The tougher air pollution controls before Congress would require
cuts in acid rain emissions from electric power plants, automobile
exhausts and toxic chemical releases from industrial plants.
   ``Annually the nation spends tens of billions of dollars trying
to alleviate the very real human cost of dirty air and the costs of
lung disease, cancer and public health dangers associated with air
pollution continue to rise,'' says Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., chief
sponsor of the Senate bill.
   ``The cost of cleaning up the nation's air is high, but the cost
of not cleaning the air is even higher,'' he continued.
   Environmentalists, responding to the Business Roundtable cost
estimates, contended that industry exaggerated the expected impact
of the 1970 Clean Air Act when it was debated 20 years ago.
   ``This is part of an industry ritual on the eve of any pollution
control debate in Congress. They release inflated figures,'' said
Richard Ayres of the Natural Resources Defense Council, also
chairman of the Clean Air Coalition.
   Likewise, business interests and the Bush administration dispute
the Senate Democrats' contention that their bill will be no more
expensive than the president's version.
   A review of the Senate bill by the Environmental Protection
Agency, not yet released, will show ``substantially higher'' cost
figures, said one administration official who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Provisions in the Senate bill calling for health-based standards
on toxic chemical releases from industrial plants and tighter auto
emission controls both will be costly, argues William Fay,
executive of the Clean Air Working Group, which speaks for industry.
   His group has said the Senate bill will at least double the $32
billion that industry pays each year to meet current air pollution
controls, according to Commerce Department figures.
   There also is no unanimity on the health-related costs of air
pollution. While there are such costs, argues Masciantonio, the USX
Corp. executive, the direct relationship between health costs and
specific sources of pollution has yet to be clearly shown.

   President Bush told the slumping homebuilding
industry today that he wants interest rates to drop further and
said a federal commission will study ways to make home ownership
more affordable.
   Bush, on the eve of the first anniversary of his inaugurastion,
declared, ``The 1990s must be another decade of lower taxes and
lower interest rates.''
   The president told several thousand members of the National
Association of Homebuilders that Congress must adopt ``fiscal
policies as sound as those of the average American household.''
   Bush's comments added impetus to administration efforts to
pressure the Federal Reserve Board into an easier credit policy.
   ``We cannot allow the high costs of housing to suffocate the
financial life of America's young people,'' the president said.
``When it comes to housing, this must not become a society of haves
and have-nots.''
   Observing that the cost of new homes has been steadily
increasing for the past ``decade and a half,'' Bush said more and
more young Americans are finding themselves priced out of the home
market.
   He vowed to work with Housing Secretary Jack Kemp to cut federal
red tape ``to create decent housing that people can afford.''
   He noted that he had asked Kemp to convene a commission that
would study burdensome bureaucratic barriers to affordable housing
construction ``and make recommendations on how to eliminate them.''
He offered no details.
   ``But the truth is, there's one housing policy and one sales
strategy that's better than all others combined _ a healthy growing
economy with low, long-term interest rates,'' Bush declared.
   ``Vital to homebuyer and homebuilder alike are low and stable
rates of interest,'' the president added, claiming that each
increase of one percentage point in the interest rate ``knocks
millions of families out of the market.''
   Bush's comments and those by other administration officials come
amid speculation that momentum at the Fed for easing credit policy
had ended.
   As he has done in nearly all of his speeches this year, Bush
also called on Congress to act on items that he proposed last year,
especially his proposal for a cut in the tax rate on capital gains
_ the profit from sales of investments.
   ``I call on the Democrat leaders of Congress to give the
American people a break and to let the House and Senate work their
will by having an up-and-down vote on the capital gains tax cut,''
Bush said.
   He also the homebuilders organization that he stands firm in his
opposition to massive new government public housing projects and
will press again in the upcoming session of Congress for a plan to
give public housing tenants vouchers to make it easier for them to
buy their own units.
   Bush made a special point of praising former President Carter
and his wife Rosalynn as a ``point of light'' for working with an
organization that helps provide low-cost shelter.
   The president also departed from his prepared text to tell the
homeowners that he was annoyed to see ``so many suburbs denuded of
trees'' when builders clear new tracts and subdivisions and asked
them to save some, both for the sake of business and for the
environment.
   Several hecklers holding a sign protesting U.S. aid to the
government of El Salvador jeered Bush briefly from the back of the
hall before being led away by security officers.
   Bush took note of a planned white supremacist march Saturday
near the Martin Luther King center in Atlanta.
   ``Atlanta is a great, cheerful city that has proudly risen from
the ashes of a distant past,'' he said. ``And for those who plan to
revel in a rally of hate here tomorrow, let them know this:
Atlantans, like all Americans, turn their backs on bigots.''
   Following his speech in Atlanta's Omni Coliseum, the president
was flying to Florida for a late-afternoon tour and briefing at
Everglades National Park and to speak at a fund-raising dinner in
Miami for Republican Gov. Bob Martinez's re-election campaign.
   On Thursday, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater urged
lower interest rates, breaking the administration's general policy
of not commenting on Fed policy.
   ``This is not a new message. But it's important occasionally to
point out that lower interest rates are normally good for the
economy,'' he said.
   Furthermore, he said Fed members should take a close look at
recent economic indicators _ which show moderate inflation and
sluggishness in retail sales and housing _ and ``understand these
numbers are low and indicate inflation has remained very steady
over the last seven or eight years and that lower interest rates
are justified.''
   The administration's statement on interest rate policy comes
amid speculation that momentum for lower rates at the Fed had ended.
   No one would welcome lower rates more than the homebuilders, who
have just finished their worst year since the recession of 1982.
   The housing industry was sluggish through most of 1989 as the
Fed pushed up interest rates as it sought to slow the economy and
curtail inflation.
   As concerns grew that the economy might be slowing too much, the
Fed allowed interest rates to gradually fall in recent months _ but
not by enough to help the homebuilding industry.
   David Seiders, chief economist for the organization Bush was
addressing, said he is counting on a ``moderate decline in interest
rates in the first half of the year'' to sustain his organization's
forecast for a better year this year.
   The Commerce Department on Thursday reported that housing starts
_ construction begun on new homes and apartments _ tumbled by 8
percent in December, the worst performance since October 1982.
   Fitzwater said the plunge was ``not good news,'' although
analysts blamed much of the drop on unseasonably cold weather in
much of the nation.

   The Pillsbury Dough Boy has undergone a
dizzying year of change under new owner Grand Metropolitan PLC as
the British conglomerate made painful cuts that many inside the
food company say were overdue.
   ``There had been a strangulation of the organization _ too many
layers,'' said former Pillsbury executive David Webber. ``It wasn't
like a smooth-running machine that all of a sudden toppled.''
   The transformation began Jan. 4, 1989, when London-based Grand
Met acquired Pillsbury for $5.8 billion, ending a hostile takeover
bid that included expensive court battles in Minnesota and Delaware.
   The changes have ranged from a revamping of Pillsbury's Burger
King fast-food subsidiary to the sale of seafood and restaurant
businesses and the closure of unproductive facilities.
   Another major restructuring was announced Thursday, a $140
million investment to modernize food plants and lay off 1,300
workers over the next 18 months. The job losses could be offset by
at least 800 new jobs, the company said.
   The restructuring will reduce to about 57,000 the number of
employees at Pillsbury and at Burger King headquarters and
company-owned stores. Pillsbury and Burger King operate separately.
   ``My favorite analogy is burning our boats in the bay,'' said
Ian Martin, Pillsbury's new chief executive officer and a Grand Met
veteran. ``I like to stand with my troops on the hillside and say,
`There stand the boats. They're burning. We're not going back out
by sea. The only way we win is by going over the hill.'''
   Webber said Martin wasted no time demonstrating the gung-ho
approach. The 11-year Pillsbury executive was fired in July _ and
received a generous severance package _ after presenting a flat
sales projection for the beleaguered frozen pizza division.
   ``In my terms,'' Martin said, ``that's planning for failure.''
   The changes have coincided with a 30 percent increase in
operating income at Pillsbury over the first nine months of 1989
compared with the same period a year earlier, Grand Met says. The
company does not disclose net profit for Pillsbury.
   Grand Met, with 1989 sales of $9.5 billion, is staking
Pillsbury's future largely on its Green Giant vegetables, the line
of baking products represented by the Dough Boy, Haagen-Dazs ice
cream, frozen pizza and Burger King. The fast-food unit reported
sales of $5.4 billion last year and added $119 million to Grand
Met's operating profit for the year ended Sept. 30.
   Besides beefing up Burger King's advertising campaign, Grand Met
has appointed Haagen-Dazs quality control executive Sam Yong to
improve quality at the chain _ an area considered one of its faults.
   ``They are more decisive. They don't hesitate,'' said William
Pothitos, a Burger King franchisee in Montreal. ``The last regime
used to manage by committee.''
   Said Webber of the man who fired him: ``I do think Ian Martin
was a very welcome addition. There had been a strangulation of the
organization _ too many layers.''
   Under former Chairman William Spoor, Pillsbury routinely
underwent double-digit growth. But the company grew awkward and
after John Stafford took control in 1985, it sputtered. Profits,
which hit $208.1 million in fiscal 1986, were headed for a dismal
$69.3 million in fiscal 1988 when Spoor returned from retirement to
replace Stafford.
   By then the company was ripe for a takeover and Philip L. Smith,
hired from the former General Foods Corp., had been chairman less
than a month when Grand Met made its unsolicited tender offer of
$60 a share on Oct. 4. Smith ultimately left with a ``golden
parachute'' severance payment worth more than $8 million.
   Martin said Pillsbury had been suffering from inertia.
   Most of the plans carried out by Grand Met were ``somewhere in
the bowels of the organization,'' he said. ``We just went ahead and
did it. I don't know, somehow they seemed to have bruised feet in
the starting blocks.
   ``When I move, I move quickly,'' he said.
   B. Sham Moteelall, 39, the former transportation manager for the
industrial foods division and one of the victims of Grand Met's
drastic restructuring, thinks Martin moved too quickly.
   ``I figured I was the guy who was going to survive,'' said
Moteelall, who was fired during an office champagne party in April.
``When they start herding people out the doors, how do they know
they're herding the right ones? How do they know they're not
cutting into the bone?''

<HEAD>Passenger Group Calls for $1 Billion Security Fund</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An organization that represents
airline passengers on Friday called for a $1 levy on all air
tickets to finance a $1 billion program to improve airline security
and fight terrorism.
   Geoffrey Lipman, secretary-general of the International
Foundation for Airline Passengers, said such a fund would
contribute towards research into more sophisticated security
technology and improved training of airline staff, particularly in
Third World countries.
   He cited a survey by the foundation that showed 80 percent of
travelers questioned would support such a charge on tickets. The
proposed fund would supplement existing security expenditures by
governments and airlines, Lipman added.
   Some U.S. airlines, such as Pan Am and Trans World Airlines, add
$5 to the cost of a trans-Atlantic ticket to cover security
screening for international flights.
   ``It is not a question of the money, it's the organization and
the motivation,'' he told an American International Club audience
in Geneva.
   ``It's the need to battle against the kind of inertia that sets
in 12 months after Lockerbie,'' he said, referring to the bomb that
downed Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland on Dec. 21, 1988, killing
all 259 people on board and 11 people on the ground.
   Lipman called for tougher international action, including
severing aviation links with countries known to support or protect
air terrorists.
   He said that although many airports had tightened safety
procedures, much more needed to be done to implement existing
security conventions on issues such as baggage checks.
   In Washington, the Federal Aviation Administration met Friday
with U.S. airline industry representatives on security issues. The
agency was expected to appeal to the airlines not to go public when
they receive terrorist threats against passenger flights.

   Foreign investment in Portugal rose 161
percent in 1989 to $2.4 billion, according to government figures
cited by Portugese news media Friday.
   The figures reveal a rising trend: in 1988, direct foreign
investment rose 124 percent to over $920 million, and in 1987,
foreign investment also showed triple-digit gains.
   According to figures cited by Trade and Tourism Minister Joaquim
Ferreira do Amaral, the main components of foreign investment last
year were tourism and real estate with 34 percent, banking and
insurance with 21 percent and manufacturing with 20 percent.
   Without giving figures, Ferreira do Amaral said Britain was the
biggest investor in Portugal, followed by France, Spain, the United
States and Japan.

<TEXT>
   Unsuspecting widows who say they lost it all
because of irresponsible brokers entrusted with the nest egg? They
don't make this stuff up.
   Elfy Willdorff, 65, of New York, claims she lost more than $1
million in the October 1987 stock market crash because of risky
trading by Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Legal papers filed in her arbitration case show Mrs. Willdorff
opened a retail account at Shearson in 1983 with her life savings,
including money left by her husband, who ran a small dental supply
business.
   The claim accuses broker Walter Kovler, himself around 80 years
old, with unsuitable and unsupervised trading in speculative stock
options using the conservative stock-and-bond portfolio she brought
to the Wall Street firm.
   Mrs. Willdorff's case typifies disputes resolved out of court in
arbitration before a panel usually consisting of two independent
arbitrators and one from the securities industry.
   ``This is the horror that occurred to thousands of unwitting
small investors who will never be able to recover from what
happened in 1987,'' said attorney Theodore Eppenstein. ``Mrs.
Willdorff went from a millionaire to insolvency in a few weeks.''
   When Mrs. Willdorff opened her account, she signed a contract
requiring her to submit any grievance to arbitration, forfeiting
the right to sue. The Supreme Court last year upheld such contracts.
   Mrs. Willdorff will be bound by the decision of the arbitration
panel, with limited rights of appeal. Studies show investors win
about half their cases and victorious plaintiffs recover about half
their losses.
   Eppenstein _ who unsuccessfully argued the Supreme Court case on
arbitrations contracts _ said that given the size of the claim he
would have sued Shearson rather than arbitrate.
   Theodore A. Krebsbach, Shearson's litigation director, declined
to comment because arbitration proceedings are supposed to be
private. ``I think any claimant would be upset with us if we went
public with the facts of a case that was pending,'' he said.
   German-born Mrs. Willdorff, separated from her parents in 1939
and taken to England as part of a wartime child rescue mission, had
invested in blue-chip securities until she took her account to
Shearson, the legal papers state.
   Her account statements show total equity of $938,164 on Sept.
27, 1987, which turned into a deficit of $400,145 on Oct. 31, 12
days after the crash.
   The complaint says Shearson engaged in risky options trading
that was unsuitable given Mrs. Willdorff's age, financial needs and
investing history _ a common claim in customer-broker disputes.
Options trading is highly speculative but generates higher broker
commissions than routine stock transactions.
   The complaint states Mrs. Willdorff's income is about $10,000 a
year from the dental supply business, Social Security and West
German wartime reparations payments. The papers say Shearson knew
she relied on her account for living expenses, including a
rent-stabilized one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan.
   The papers also claim Shearson failed to supervise the broker,
breached a duty to act in the customer's best interest, reassured
Mrs. Willdorff that her investments were safe and failed to tell
her when her money evaporated.

   Stock prices put in a mixed performance on
London's Stock Exchange Friday after weathering a particularly
hectic week.
   Over the last five sessions, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index lost nearly 2 percent in value. Only on Wednesday
did the index post a moderate gain.
   At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was down 1.9 points, or 0.08 percent, at 2,335.0.
   Share prices have been unsettled by declines in bond markets
around the world that were sparked by rising concern about interest
rates. Instability in the Soviet Union and worries over British
wage inflation and labor disputes have dampened investors' appetite
for shares.
   But dealers said Friday's session was dull amid confusion over
the market's next near-term direction.
   ``People are going to do little or nothing until they feel that
bond and equity markets have settled down,'' one trader said.
   The Financial Times 30-share index rose 3.6 points to close at
1,868.0 points. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 0.82 point
to close at 1,276.46.
   Volume came to a light 391.0 million shares, compared with 462.2
million shares on Thursday.

<HEAD>Seaway Set Export Steel Record in '89 as Total Tonnage Fell</HEAD>

   The St. Lawrence Seaway handled a record 1.5
million metric tons of export steel in 1989 but total cargo tonnage
declined 3.4 million metric tons due largely to a drop in Canadian
grain shipments, according to preliminary year-end statistics.
   ``The seaway handled 422 percent more export steel this year
than it did last year,'' said James L. Emery, administrator of the
Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corp., which operates the U.S.
portion of the inland waterway.
   In 1988, 287,000 metric tons of export steel traversed the
waterway, which runs from the Atlantic Ocean through the Great
Lakes to Duluth, Minn. The previous record year for export steel
through the seaway was 1982, when 1.25 million metric tons were
moved.
   ``Seventy percent of U.S. steel production is in the Great Lakes
region and, obviously, the seaway has been increasing its share of
that steel,'' Emery said in a statement Thursday.
   Nationally, U.S. steel exports are estimated to have reached 3.6
million metric tons in 1989, double 1988's total, according to the
American Iron and Steel Institute.
   The institute attributed the jump in U.S. steel exports to the
low value of the dollar, an improvement in steel quality, intense
marketing of U.S. steel in Europe and the Far East and improved
productivity.
   Stone and salt were also shipped through the seaway in record
amounts. Stone was up 4 percent, from 432,000 metric tons in 1988
to 448,000 metric tons. Salt increased 34 percent, from one million
metric tons in 1988 to 1.3 million metric tons.
   On the downside, Canadian grain shipments through the seaway
dropped 4.2 million metric tons last year, according to the seaway
corporation.
   Other declines were seen in fuel oil, which dropped 35 percent;
chemicals, down 22 percent; coke, down 13 percent, and scrap iron
and steel, 14 percent.
   As a result, total seaway tonnage dropped to 37.1 million metric
tons, a 9 percent decline from 1988's total of 40.5 million metric
tons.
   While all these figures were preliminary, Emery said the final
tonnages would vary by a few metric tons if at all when they are
released next month.
   Almost 2,800 commercial vessels traveled through U.S. seaway
locks in 1989. On average, they carried cargo weighing 17,292 tons,
about 2 percent more than in 1988, the corporation said.
   The last vessel cleared the seaway on Dec. 23 and the waterway
was closed for the winter. Locks are now undergoing improvements
and winter maintenance.

   Federal regulators are putting off a decision
on whether to act against Neil Bush, the president's son, after
reviewing information from an investigation of Bush's role in the
failure of a Colorado thrift association.
   An internal committee of the Office of Thrift Supervision met
into the evening Thursday and said Friday that it would reconvene
Tuesday on the matter.
   Meanwhile, the thrift office, a bureau of the Treasury
Department, said in a statement that W. James Metz, majority
stockholder of Silverado, became the fourth officer of the thrift
to accept a lifetime ban from working for a federally insured
financial institution.
   Bush, 34, was a director of Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan
Association, Denver, from 1985 until August 1988, when his father
accepted the Republican presidential nonimation.
   Regulators shut down the thrift in December 1988, blaming the
institution's management for heavily investing in Colorado's ailing
commercial real estate market.
   The collapse of Silverado, now operating as part of Columbia
Savings, the largest thrift in Colorado, is expected to cost
taxpayers up to $1 billion.
   Regulators are focusing their investigation on what they said
was ``an exceptionally large number of problem transactions''
between Silverado insiders and borrowers.
   Bush, who was a partner in an oil exploration firm, JNB
Exploration, had business deals with two of Silverado's major
borrowers, developers Bill L. Walters and Ken Good.
   Bush has said in interviews that he has nothing to hide and is
cooperating fully with investigators. He met several times last
week with thrift office enforcement officials.
   Possible civil penalties Bush could receive range from banning
him from the industry to ordering him to refrain from violating
banking regulations in the future. Such civil penalties would not
interfere with any later criminal prosecution if one was indicated.
   Separately, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is considering
whether to file a civil suit against the S&amp;L's officers and
director seeking recovery of Silverado's losses.
   A former federal S&amp;L examiner, James Moroney, has alleged that
regulators dragged their feet on Silverado because of Bush's
presence on the institution's board and its other political
connections.
   Regulators in Washington have said they investigated Moroney's
allegations and found them invalid. Bush has said he never sought
to use his political connections and would not have if asked.
   Metz agreed to the industry ban without admitting or denying
wrongdoing. He will be prohibited from working for an S&amp;L, bank or
credit union without prior approval from regulators.
   Previously, former Silverado chairman Michael R. Wise and former
vice chairmen Richard K. Vandapool and Robert M. Lewis had agreed
to accept a similar penalty.

   Stock prices staged a moderate advance today in
what analysts described as a technical rally after the market's
recent drop.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 9.39 to 2,675.77 by
2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading

<HEAD>European Community Foreign Ministers Meet On Eastern Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Western European foreign ministers will gather
Saturday amid mounting calls to deepen their political union and
come up with more money for Eastern Europe.
   The special session of the 12-nation European Community in
Dublin Castle, Ireland, follows a bold call this week from the
community's executive body, the European Commission, for
accelerated political and economic unity.
   European Commission President Jacques Delors suggested the
community increase its budget by $1.65 billion to aid Eastern
Europe and indicated that East Germany could soon join the European
Community.
   France and West Germany, pressing the pace for closer union,
backed the suggestion, but Britain immediately signaled caution and
opposed new loans to Eastern Europe's six emerging democracies _
Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Bulgaria and Romania.
   Britain contends the East bloc nations are already deep in debt
and says the emphasis should be on training in the running of a
free enterprise economy.
   Ireland, which on Jan. 1 took over the six-month, rotating
presidency of the European Community, was anxious to avoid an open
dispute. But the Irish Foreign Ministry acknowledged Friday there
were ``differences of emphasis between the community countries.''
   Irish Foreign Minister Gerry Collins summoned the Saturday night
meeting to review the fast-changing situation in Eastern Europe.
But the meeting also is likely to rekindle differences over
political and monetary integration.
   Delors, a French socialist, called for a new ``institutional
structure'' for the community, implying wide-ranging new powers for
the Brussels-based commission over national governments. In London,
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher described his remarks as a
``great pity.''
   Delors also envisaged special links between the community and
the six Eastern European countries, adding East Germany was a
``special case.''
   ``There is a place for East Germany in the community should it
so wish,'' he said.
   The European Community is coordinating aid to the emerging
democracies of Eastern Europe at the request of last July's summit
in Paris of the world's seven most industrialized cuntries, the
United States, Japan, Canada, France, West Germany, Britain and
Italy.
   At that time only Poland and Hungary had moved away from
communist rule. Aid totalling some $6 billion has been pledged by
24 Western countries to Poland and Hungary. Since then, Western
nations have offered similar help to the four other countries.
   Proposed aid includes a development bank called the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development in Eastern Europe.

<HEAD>Wheat, Soybean Futures Fall On Moisture, Slack Demand</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat and soybean futures prices fell Friday on
the Chicago Board of Trade, dropping sharply near the close on
selling linked to slack export demand and improved growing
conditions for winter wheat and South American soybeans.
   Corn futures finished narrowly mixed.
   Wheat futures sank to their lowest levels in almost four months,
extending a decline that began Thursday when large amounts of snow
and rain began falling on wheat fields from the Texas panhandle to
western Kansas.
   But Friday's pattern of steep losses only in the March and May
wheat contracts indicated the selling was inspired more by slack
export demand than the beneficial weather, said Jerry Zusel,
manager of exchange floor operations for Balfour Maclaine Corp.
   In the wheat market, the March and May contracts represent
stockpiled grain while contracts for later delivery represent the
new crop.
   ``I think today's action, at least for soft red winter wheat,
signals that old-crop wheat is very expensive and prospects for any
new business is not very great in the near term,'' Zusel said.
   The soybean market has been trending lower all week on reports
of rain in southern Brazil, an important soybean-growing region.
   At the close, wheat futures were \ cent to 5 cents lower with
the contract for delivery in March at $3.92} a bushel; corn was }
cent lower to } cent higher with March at $2.41{ a bushel; oats
were unchanged to { cent higher with March at $1.38\ a bushel;
soybeans were 1 cent to 5\ cents lower with January at $5.57} a

<HEAD>China Reports Record Grain Harvest</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also on general news wires.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China harvested a record 407.9 million tons of
grain last year, the official China Daily reported Friday.
   Agriculture Minister He Kang, speaking at an agricultural
conference Thursday, also said 1 million scientists and teachers
will be sent to the countryside this year as part of a drive to
further increase grain output.
   China reached its previous high of 407.3 million tons in 1984,
but output fell to 379 million tons in 1985, the first of four
straight disappointing harvests.
   In 1989, grain production was 394 million tons.
   The poor crops resulted from bad weather and a decrease in land
devoted to grain crops. Farmers recently have built houses or small
factories on farmland or switching to vegetables and other crops
that pay better than grain.
   The government, concerned the nation was losing its ability to
feed itself, has tightened restrictions on the conversion of
farmland and urged farmers to meet their quotas for grain. Last
year, it also increased subsidies to rural areas after 1988 when
local banks ran out of money to pay farmers and were forced to
issue IOUs.
   He said fields planted with grain increased by 4.9 million acres
last year, to about 272 million acres.
   He said the central budget had budgeted $3.9 billion for
agricultural production in 1990, an increase of about $42.5 million.
   Agriculture experts have said China must produce 500 million
tons of grain annually by 2000 just to keep up with population
growth.

   Deutsche Lufthansa AG of West
Germany said Friday it has reached agreement with Interflug, the
East German national airline, on a broad cooperation plan involving
passenger service, cargo and other areas.
   Lufthansa said it and Interflug have agreed to work together as
two independent airlines ``to improve the quality of their services
in the interest of our customers and to strengthen the efficiency
of their airline operations and the market positions of both
companies.''
   Based on a ``treaty'' similar to that planned between the East
and West German governments, the two airlines will develop joint
projects to find new market segments and fields of cooperation,
Lufthansa said.
   The two companies also will attempt to remove the remaining
barriers to air traffic between the two German countries and
Berlin. Currently, neither Lufthansa nor Interflug are allowed to
cross the border between the two countries, and neither airline is
permitted to fly to West Berlin.
   The East Berlin airport, Schoenefeld, is located outside the
city limits to circumvent the Allied powers' restrictions on air
traffic to East Berlin.

<HEAD>PaineWebber Earnings Up Sharply</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PaineWebber Group Inc. said Friday its 1989
fourth-quarter earnings rose sharply despite losses from the Oct.
13 market drop and hard times thoughout the industry.
   PaineWebber said its earnings for the full year rose 18.5
percent.
   The firm is expected to be one of the few on Wall Street to
report profits for last year, one of the least profitable in the
decade.
   For the quarter ended Dec. 31, PaineWebber reported net income
of $10.9 million, or 20 cents per share after deducting preferred
stock dividends, compared with $512,000, or a 20-cents-a-share
loss, in the same 1988 quarter.
   Revenue totaled $452 million for the quarter, up slightly from
$447 million the year before.
   But PaineWebber said that accounting for its preferred stock
dividend requirements, net income was $4.96 million in the fourth
quarter, up from a $5.73 million loss in the year-previous fourth
quarter.
   PaineWebber Chairman Donald B. Marron said the quarterly
earnings were reduced because of arbitrage trading losses in United
Airlines during the 190-point stock market plunge on Oct. 13.
   For the full year, the firm reported net income of $51.96
million, or $1.05 a share, compared with earnings of $42.4 million,
or 58 cents a share, in the samd 1988 period. Revenue was $1.73
billion, a slight decline from $1.75 billion in 1988.
   After accounting for preferred stock dividends, the firm's
annual earnings rose to $28.2 million from $16.7 million in 1988.
   PaineWebber attributed the annual increase to improvements in
retail sales, institutional sales and trading, investment banking
and international businesses.
   PaineWebber employs about 12,900 people in nearly 300 offices
worldwide.

<HEAD>House Panel Plans to Investigate Federated-Allied Bankruptcy
Filing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Judiciary Committee will investigate
the bankruptcy filings by Campeau Corp.'s U.S. retail divisions and
look into the consequences of leveraged buyouts, Chairman Jack
Brooks announced Friday.
   Brooks, D-Texas, said the Judiciary subcommittee on economic and
commercial law would hold hearings on the court-supervised
reorganization of Federated Stores Inc., the renamed holding
company of Campeau's U.S. operations, and the potential for a wave
of new bankruptcies resulting from debt-financed takeovers in
recent years.
   ``The gold rush is over now, and the time for reassessment has
arrived. I intend to move quickly in the upcoming session of
Congress to consider the lessons of the Campeau bankruptcy, and how
LBO bankruptcies will affect consumers, suppliers, creditors and
the American economy,'' Brooks said.
   Swamped by debt, Campeau's Federated Department Stores Inc. and
Allied Stores Corp. divisions filed for protection from creditors
under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Act on Monday. The 258
stores run by Federated and Allied will remain open while the court
oversees their restructuring.
   Toronto-based Campeau's acquisition of Federated in 1988 and
Allied in 1986 left the two saddled with $7.7 billion in debt.
Together Federated and Allied run nine department store chains such
as Bloomingdale's, Burdines, Jordan Marsh, Rich's and Lazarus.
   ``With Campeau's bankruptcy in the first days of the 1990s, our
nation has begun to reap the bitter harvest of the leveraged buyout
frenzy of the 1980s,'' said Brooks, who is also chairman of the
subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over competition policy as
well as bankruptcy law.
   ``I fear that the Campeau Chapter 11 filing in Cincinnati this
week is only the beginning, and that we will see the takeover
trophies of the 1980s become the bankruptcy case names of the
1990s,'' Brooks said.

<HEAD>Original Kentucky Fried Chicken Site To Be Museum</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CORBIN, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant
is being restored as a working museum in this southeastern Kentucky
town, which hatched a business that now has $5 billion in sales in
58 countries.
   Officials working on the restoration hope to finish the project
in time for the 100th birthday of the restaurant's founder, Col.
Harland Sanders. The unveiling of the new museum will coincide with
Laurel County's 1990 World Chicken Festival.
   The restaurant and motel originally were called Sanders Court
and Cafe. That's where the colonel developed and perfected his
famous recipe and the technique of pressure frying, said Wallace
Hebert, marketing director for J.R.N. Inc., owner of the franchise.
   There are now 7,900 Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants in the
United States and 57 foreign countries, including one in Tiananmen
Square in Beijing, China, said Richard Detwiler, a spokesman for
Kentucky Fried Chicken Corp. Retail sales were $5 billion in 1988,
he said.
   Franchise owner John R. Neal has wanted to restore the original
restaurant for many years, said Hebert. It was closed in September
1988 and moved to a temporary location next door.
   A restoration team is advertising to purchase any artifacts from
the original restaurant, which opened in 1940, including furniture,
menus and kitchen utensils, he said. Members of the community have
donated silverware, old uniforms, tables, chairs and other items
from the old restaurant.
   One of the more unusual features of the old Sanders Court and
Cafe was a model motel room that guests had to pass through in
order to use the bathroom or the pay telephone, said Hebert. This
was Sanders' marketing strategy to show people the quality of the
motel rooms and boost his motel business, said Hebert.
   ``He was a shrewd marketer. He really was,'' he said.
   An official with the Laurel County Tourism Commission said he
hopes the museum and the chicken festival, which will feature
cooking contests, two parades and a Col. Sanders look-a-like
contest, will boost the region's tourist economy.
   ``We hope to make this an annual event,'' said Ken Harvey of the
World Chicken Festival.

dailies and cable directories.
   Fairchild spokesman Phil Meeks declined to say how much revenue
the division generated last year.
   Milford Publishing, previously owned by Goodson Newspapers of
New Jersey, will now join Capital Cities' Shore Line Newspapers
Group, which publishes 18 weekly and semiweekly newspapers and
shoppers.
   Capital Cities announced Monday that it had purchased Imprint, a

   Stock prices closed out a zigzag week Friday
with a moderate rise that analysts described as a technical rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials gained 11.52 to
2,677.90, reducing its loss for the week to 11.31 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 6 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
830 up, 656 down and 477 unchanged.
   Stock prices began to stabilize late in Thursday's session, when
buying of blue chips enabled the market to finish mixed after a
broad early retreat.
   Analysts said traders' spirits brightened Friday as interest
rates dropped back a bit in the government securities market after
their steady rise of the past few weeks.
   But considerable skepticism lingered on the Street about the
staying power of any rally attempt.
   Corporate earnings reports issued to date for the fourth quarter
of 1989 have contained some even bigger disappointments than
traders were expecting.
   In addition, rising interest rates in Japan, West Germany and
other industrialized countries have intensified speculation about
the possibility of an international business slump in the months
ahead.
   Digital Equipment dropped 4\ to 77} on top of a 5~-point loss
Thursday, when the company posted a quarterly earnings decline that
was sharper than many observers had expected.
   Bank of NewEngland led the active list, down 1{ at 2}. The
company said it expects to report losses exceeding $1 billion for
the fourth quarter and for all of 1989.
   Bank of New England's mounting woes touched off widespread
selling in the stocks of other Northeastern bank holding companies.
   Citytrust Bancorp fell 1| to 9&rsqb;; Bank of Boston 1| to 15{;
Shawmut National 1&lsqb; to 15~, and First Fidelity Bancorp 1} to 21.
   Among New York City banking issues, Citicorp lost { to 26; J.P.
Morgan { to 37&lsqb;; Manufacturers Hanover \ to 33}, and Chemical
Banking &lsqb; to 28~.
   Energy stocks, by contrast, mostly bucked the downtrend. Exxon
rose | to 48|; Chevron 1 to 67; Amoco 1} to 52&rsqb;; Schlumberger 1 to
48&rsqb;, and Halliburton { to 41&lsqb;.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 185.59 million
shares, against 178.59 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 214.33 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $9.61 billion, or 0.29
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .49 to 187.56.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 1.15 to 389.97, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up .96 at 339.15.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added
3.36 to 440.88. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 366.08, down .09.

<HEAD>Insurance Switch Denied for Home Savings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators on Friday denied
California's Home Savings of America, the largest and one of the
healthiest thrift institutions in the nation, permission to switch
to the insurance fund backing commercial bank deposits.
   Home Savings, whose deposits are insured by the Savings
Association Insurance Fund, had applied to merge with its
wholly-owned subsidiary, Bowery Savings Bank of New York, which is
already insured by the Bank Insurance Fund. Members of the savings
fund pay higher deposit insurance premiums than members of the bank
fund.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision said it denied the switch
because S&amp;L bailout legislation passed last August bars thrifts
from pulling out of the Savings Association Insurance Fund for five
years.
   Home Savings had applied for the switch to the thrift office's
predecessor, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, before the law was
enacted.
   The thrift already has filed a federal lawsuit trying to
complete the Bowery merger, and spokeswoman Mary Triggs said Home
would continue to fight that case in the courts.
   The Irwindale, Calif., thrift had assets of $44 billion on Dec.
31. Its withdrawal from the savings insurance fund would be a major
blow to the fund, which is intended to pay for S&amp;L failures after
the money from the bailout bill runs out.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Gain Ground</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices gained ground Friday thanks to
foreign buying following a steep sell-off the day before.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond rose 21-32 point, or
$6.56 for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which falls when
prices advance, slipped to 8.26 percent from 8.33 percent late
Thursday.
   Analysts said much of the improvement came in overseas trading
of U.S. government securities in Tokyo and London before the New
York market opened. Tokyo traders had been selling U.S. securities
to make profits and offset losses in the struggling Japanese stock
and bond markets.
   But on Friday, ``the Bank of Japan bought Japanese government
bonds during the Tokyo session,'' said Kathleen Camilli, a money
market economist with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ``That helped to
support our market as well.''
   ``It does look like we've reached (bond price) levels where
we're attracting some foreign demand,'' said William V. Sullivan,
director of money- market research at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Bond prices tumbled 29-32 point, or about $9 per $1,000 face
amount, on Thursday in reaction to increased fears of inflation and
comments by two Federal Reserve Board governors that they did had
no plans to ease monetary policy.
   The government reported the highest year-end inflation rate in
eight years and economists forecast a sharp rise in consumer prices
in January, which depressed the bond market.
   The market had little reaction to a survey released Friday by
the Fed's Philadelphia bureau that the economy was increasing
slightly in January in the region.
   It also did not react strongly to President Bush calling for
lower interest rates to spur growth. The White House on Thursday
directly said the Fed should lower interest rates.
   Lower interest rates, which encourage businesses and banks to
borrow money, increasing demand for bonds, send prices of
government securities higher.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
government issues gained 3-32 point to \ point, intermediate
maturities rose 5-16 point to 7-16 point and long-term issues
advanced 19-32 point, according to figures provided by Telerate
Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, was up 3.67 at 1,171.77.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.98 percent as the
discount declined 5 basis points to 7.73 percent. Yields on
six-month bills slipped to 7.99 percent as the discount lost 6
basis points to 7.59 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 7.97
percent as the discount lost 5 basis points to 7.43 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted at 8&lsqb; percent, unchanged from late Thursday.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds closed at 92 5-16, up 1-16 point. The
average yield to maturity fell to 7.35 percent from 7.36 percent
late Thursday.

   The Associated Press reported erroneously
Jan. 18 that a restructuring of Pillsbury Inc. had reduced the
number of employees at Pillsbury and its Burger King business to
about 16,500 from 104,000 in mid-1988.
   The combined employment at Pillsbury, Burger King headquarters

   In mid-1988, prior to the takeover, total employment at
Pillsbury, Burger King headquarters and Burger King restaurants

several businesses that since have been sold by Grand Met.
   The story also erroneously reported Grand Met's annual sales as
$9.5 billion. Annual sales totaled about $15 billion in 1989.

<HEAD>Dollar Closes Mostly Lower; Gold Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar was mostly lower against other
major currencies Friday in trading that was dominated by the
Canadian dollar. Gold prices moved lower.
   Analysts said trading in the U.S. dollar was quiet. Ronald
Holzer, chief dealer with Harris Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago, said the
foreign-exchange markets focused on the Canadian dollar, which has
fallen throughout the week in response to the Bank of Canada's
decision to ease its monetary policy and allow interest rates to
decline.
   At the close of trading in New York, the U.S. dollar was worth
1.1836 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1713 late Thursday and 1.1573 a
week earlier. In European trading, the U.S. dollar closed at 1.1786
Canadian dollars, up from late Thursday's 1.1713.
   Ken Foxcroft, senior vice president at Toronto-Dominion Bank,
said, ``Interest rates in Canada are starting to ease while rates
in the rest of the world are continuing to move up, so a lot of the
attraction of investing in Canada is disappearing.''
   Analysts attributed some of the declines in the U.S. dollar to
profit-taking ahead of the weekend.
   The dollar fell against the British pound. In London, one
British pound cost $1.6475 late Friday, more expensive for buyers
than Thursday's late $1.6445. In later New York trading, a pound
cost $1.6470, compared to late Thursday's $1.6435.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday's rates, included: 1.7105 West German marks, down from
1.7150; 1.5205 Swiss francs, down from 1.5245; 5.8130 French
francs, down from 5.8275; and 1,274.12 Italian lire, down from
1,276.25.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Thursday's
prices, included: 1.5140 Swiss francs, down from 1.5185; 5.6955
French francs, down from 5.8090; 1.9310 Dutch guilders, up from
1.9130; 1,269.25 Italian lire, down from 1,272.00.; and 1.1786
Canadian dollars, up from 1.1713.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 146.33 Japanese yen, up from
145.66 yen. In late London trading the dollar closed at 145.60 yen,
and in New York, the dollar fell to 145.925 yen from late
Thursday's 146.35 yen.
   Gold prices fell in thin trading.
   In New York, gold fell 20 cents to $410 a troy ounce on the
Commodity Exchange. Republic National Bank of New York later quoted
a bid of $410, down 80 cents from late Thursday.
   Bullion closed in London, the major European trading center, at
a bid price of $410.25 a troy ounce, down from $413.75, and in
Zurich, Switzerland, at $408.65 bid, down from $413.
   Earlier in Hong Kong the bid gold price fell to $410.50 from
Thursday's $413.95.
   Silver prices were mixed. Silver rose 1.2 cents on the Commodity
Exchange to $5.202 a troy ounce after trading in London at a bid
$5.22 a troy ounce, down from $5.26 late Thursday.

<HEAD>New Jersey to Consider Rules on Long-Distance Information Systems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE P. BAYLISS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State regulators are considering whether
long-distance phone companies should be required to provide
information about competing services when they suffer outages like
the one that crippled AT&amp;T's network on Monday.
   ``We want to make sure that a customer who wants to make a phone
call can get the information to get a carrier to complete the
call,'' said George Dawson, a spokesman for the state Board of
Public Utilities.
   AT&amp;T's long-distance service nationwide was out for nine hours
on Monday. Company officials traced the problem to a bug in a new
software program.
   Dawson said BPU officals had read news accounts of people who
complained that during the outage, AT&amp;T operators refused to give
out the access codes of the nation's two other major long-distance
carriers, MCI and US Sprint.
   Dawson said the board itself had received no complaints.
   ``I don't think anybody is thinking that AT&amp;T has the
responsibility to pick another carrier for the caller,'' Dawson
said. But he said long-distance companies and the state's two local
telephone companies, New Jersey Bell and United Telephone, are
required as public utilities to provide any telephone numbers
requested, including those of competing-long-distance companies.
   New Jersey has six long-distance carriers and a seventh company
that transmits data long distance, Dawson said. Twenty companies
package long-distance service for resale.
   AT&amp;T spokesman Harry Baumgartner said the company was concerned
that whatever rule the BPU proposed ``would equitably apply to all
long-distance companies.''
   Baumgartner said that more than 400 long-distance companies
operated nationally, plus another 300 alternative operator
services. ``It's extremely difficult, if not impossible to track
all of their access codes,'' he said.
   Moreover, he said, ``AT&amp;T does not want to be in the position of
making preferential decisions'' in telling callers which competitor
to call.
   Monday's outage struck quickly and unexpectedly, and AT&amp;T did
not have working procedures in place for its operators, Baumgartner
said. AT&amp;T changed procedures to allow operators to provide the
access codes at about 6 p.m.
   New Jersey Bell operators do not give access codes, but will
provide telephone numbers for people to call to obtain the codes,
said New Jersey Bell spokeswoman Karen Johnson.
   ``We are really prohibited from giving out carrier-specific
information, and we feel the access codes fall into that
category,'' Ms. Johnson said. She said many long distance companies
did not want other companies giving out their access codes.
   United Telephone operators may not recommend long distance
carriers, said Glenn Lewis, a United spokesman. He said the company
did check with its lawyers during the outage to see what
information operators could give out.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Slump On Economic Slowdown Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices fell sharply Friday on New York's
Commodity Exchange, reflecting fears of an economic slowdown, which
would reduce demand for the metal.
   On other commodity markets, precious metals were mixed; oil
futures rose; grains and soybeans were mostly lower; and livestock
and meat futures were mixed.
   Copper futures finished 1.7 cents to 3.05 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in January at $1.01 a pound. The more heavily
traded March contract settled at 99.30 cents a pound.
   The selloff extended Thursday's more moderate decline and
resulted from growing perceptions that copper demand is slackening
after more than two years of strong consumption, analysts said.
   ``What really highlighted the fact that demand is likely to
weaken is the recent stock market weakness,'' said James Steel, a
metals analyst with the futures brokerage Refco Inc.
   ``With the U.S. stock market going down and the London and
Japanese markets going down also, that's a clear indication that as
we go into 1990, demand will be soft,'' he said.
   Thursday's Commerce Department report of an 8 percent drop in
housing starts to the lowest level in seven years supported
perceptions of an economic slowdown, as did announcements of worker
layoffs by several large manufacturers.
   Copper demand is closely tied to the nation's economic health,
especially to the construction industry which accounts for more
than 40 percent of copper usage.
   Analyst Bette Raptopoulos of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
noted a lack of buying recently on the physical copper market at a
time when copper consumption is normally on the rise.
   In precious-metals trading on the Comex, gold futures settled
unchanged to 30 cents lower with February at $410.90 a troy ounce;
silver was 1 cent to 1.2 cents higher with March at $5.25 a troy
ounce.
   Petroleum futures climbed sharply on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, led by the Februry crude oil contract, which expires on
Monday.
   The buying of crude was mainly due to concerns about a possible
squeeze in supplies of crude for delivery against the February
contract, analysts said.
   Heating oil rallied and gasoline followed as temperatures fell
in the Northeast after several days of springlike conditions.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 25 cents to 91 cents
higher with February at $23.67 a barrel; heating oil was .26 cent
to 1.82 cents higher with February at 63.66 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .12 cent lower to .91 cent higher with
February at 61.62 cents a gallon.
   Wheat and soybean futures fell on the Chicago Board of Trade,
dropping sharply near the close on selling linked to slack export
demand and improved growing conditions for winter wheat and South
American soybeans.
   Wheat futures sank to their lowest levels in almost four months,
extending a decline that began Thursday when large amounts of snow
and rain began falling on wheat fields from the Texas panhandle to
southern Kansas.
   But Friday's pattern of steep losses only in the March and May
wheat contracts indicated the selling was inspired more by slack
export demand than the beneficial weather.
   Wheat futures settled 5} cents lower to \ cent higher with March
at $3.92 a bushel; corn was unchanged to } cent lower with March at
$2.41} a bushel; oats were \ cent lower to } cent higher with March
at $1.39 a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents to 6 cents lower with
January at $5.58 a bushel.
   Cattle futures posted strong gains on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange amid expectations for stronger spot markets next week.
   Live cattle futures finished .05 cent to .55 cent higher with
February at 79.35 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .43
cent higher with January at 83.85 cents a pound; live hogs were .08
cent lower to .18 cent higher with February at 49.55 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .80 cent lower to .05 cent higher with
February at 55.15 cents a pound.

<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ralston Purina Co. said Thursday its net income
fell 35 percent in the October-December quarter, largely because
profits in the year-earlier period were swelled by a large one-time
gain.
   Profits in the company's fiscal first quarter totalled $130
million or $2.03 a share, down from $202 million or $2.99 a share a
year earlier.
   The year-earlier profit figure was boosted by a $70 million gain
on the sale of Van Camp Seafood Co., the maker of Chicken of the
Sea tuna fish.
   If that one-time gain were not included, Ralston's earnings per
share would have increased to $2.03 from $1.94.
   Sales rose 11 percent to $1.88 billion from $1.68 billion.
   ``When you read everthing in, I think it's a very positive
quarter,'' said Roger Spencer, an analyst at PaineWebber in Chicago.
   Ralston spokesman Pat Farrell said higher advertising and
promotion costs for the introduction of several kinds of dog snacks
trimmed profits in the quarter.

<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Campeau Corp.'s Federated and Allied retail
divisions sent suppliers figures Friday showing they have more than
$335 million to finance shipments of new merchandise for their
stores.
   Figures released by the companies show Federated Department
Stores Inc. has a current cash balance of $220 million and Allied
Stores Corp. has $117 million in cash.
   Federated and Allied, which filed Monday for U.S. Bankruptcy
Court protection from their creditors, also have arranged credit
lines totalling $700 million to finance their reorganizations.
   ``The company said we had sufficient cash to maintain operations
without the (reorganization) financing,'' spokeswoman Carol Sanger
said. Allied said it wouldn't need to draw on the reorganization
financing until March, and Federated said it wouldn't need to use
the new financing until the fall season.
   Some suppliers, including Liz Claiborne and Leslie Fay, began
new shipments to Campeau's stores Thursday, while many others said
they were withholding merchandise until they see the retailers'
financing.
   Retail industry analysts had identified renewed merchandise
shipments as the most pressing need for the chains' stores,
especially those in the South, where the spring selling season
begins soon.
   Meanwhile, Federated and Allied were preparing teams of
executives to visit stores to explain operations under bankruptcy
court protection, Ms. Sanger said.
   ``The operation of the stores will continue unchanged. This is
just to assure them that they are having all their questions
answered,'' she said.
   Top executives of chains belonging to Federated and Allied
visited the Cincinnati headquarters for briefings Wednesday.
   In their bankruptcy court filing, Federated and Allied listed
total assets of $9.1 billion and debts of $7.7 billion. The
retailing giants, which own such chains as Bloomingdale's, Lazarus
and Burdines, have 260 stores and 100,000 employees in 43 states.
   Federated says it has a $400 million line of credit for
reorganization from a group of banks led by Citibank of New York.
Allied says it has a similar agreement for $300 million from
Chemical Bank. Both agreements still need bankruptcy court approval.
   Court approval for the retailers' reorganization credit lines
should take four to six weeks, Ms. Sanger said.
   ``It's not finalized yet, but then we have no need of it yet and
we don't anticipate needing it for quite some time,'' she said.
   The first hearing in the case is scheduled for next Thursday,
when U.S. Bankruptcy Judge J. Vincent Aug will consider a request
by the retailers to pay obligations related to employee benefits
that were due before the bankruptcy court filing.

   Energy futures ended higher in volatile trading
Friday, led by a jump in crude oil.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the February contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the main grade of U.S. crude, surged 91
cents to close at $23.67 a barrel.
   The March contract closed 49 cents higher at $22.08 a barrel
while April rose 40 cents to $21.37.
   Analysts attributed the sharp rise in the February contract to
last-minute buying before the contract expires on Monday.
   Among refined products, No. 2 heating oil for delivery in
February advanced 1.82 cents to 63.66 cents a gallon, March gained
1.01 cents to 59.68 cents and April ended 0.76 cent higher at 56.82
cents a gallon.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for February delivery added 0.91
cent to 61.62 cents a gallon, March rose 0.89 cent to 62.69 cents
and April gained 0.74 cent to 63.43 cents.
   Analysts said strong demand for heating oil during an unusual
cold spell in December tightened supplies of crude in some parts of
the country.
   ``The expiration of the February crude contract on Monday
sparked aggressive short-covering as supplies of sweet crude are
tight in Cushing, Oklahoma,'' said Andrew Lebow, senior broker with
E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures Inc.
   Energy analysts said heating oil continued to stabilize after a
19 cent drop in the last three weeks that followed December's price
spurt due to strong demand brought on by frigid weather.

company to handle its programming interests will help it deal with
possible regulatory constraints and to continue to grow, industry
analysts said Friday.
   TCI is the nation's largest cable system operator and also has
extensive interests in cable programming, including a 22 percent
stake in Turner Broadcasting System Inc.
   On Thursday, John Malone, TCI's chief executive officer, said
the TCI board authorized management to develop a plan to form and
distribute to shareholders a new company that would contain its
programming interests, its minority interest in some cable systems
and other cable service businesses.
   The spinoff would ``create a new growth vehicle for TCI
shareholders, unencumbered of potential regulatory constraints or
conflicting objectives,'' he said.
   The announcement came after the close of trading on Thursday. In
national over-the-counter trading, TCI rose $2.37{ a share to
$17.37{ on Friday.
   The cable industry has come under increasing criticism in recent
months in Congress because of rate increases over the past three
years and because of the perceived influence some major operators
have for determining whether new cable programs can be included
among serviuces available on certain cable systems.
   Legislation has been proposed to regulate rates again for the
first time since 1986 and to prohibit cable systems from owning
interests in the programs they carry.
   John Reidy, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert in New York,
said the move would ``take the steam out of these legislative
initiatives.''
   ``The segregation of programming interests into a new company
will really blunt the regulatory thrust,'' he said.
   The proposed spinoff would also help stockholders and investors
focus on TCI's values, and create a growth vehicle for the giant
cable company, said Michael Kupinski, a cable analyst for A.G.
Edwards &amp; Sons of St. Louis.
   TCI, which has about 11 million subscribers, had 1988 sales of
$2.2 billion.
   Malone said the planned spinoff would be similar to earlier
spinoffs of WestMarc Communications in 1984 and Republic Pictures
in 1985.
   The company said the TCI that will remain after the divestiture
will be devoted to managing the bulk of its present cable systems,
which includes about 18 percent of the nation's cable subscribers.
   TCI said the decision to spin off assets came at a routine board
of directors meeting during which TCI executives reportedly
expressed dismay at how the company's stock has been faring in Wall
Street. The stock, with other cable issues, has been depressed for
several months due to regulatory fears.
   Besides Turner Broadcasting, TCI owns a 50 percent stake in the
American Movie Classics cable channel, a 49 percent interest in The
Discovery Channel and a 14 percent stake in Black Entertainment
Television. TCI also has an interest in Prime Network, a regional
sports programming partnership that includes Denver's Prime Sports
Network, and recently agreed to acquire a 50 percent interest in
the Showtime pay cable service.
   TCI executives said that in addition to the programming
properties, TCI could transfer cable systems with 1 million to 2.5
million subscribers into the new corporation. Other properties
reportedly being considered include the Netlink satellite service
business, which packages cable programming for home-dish owners.

   A federal appeals court Friday threw out a bid
by the Urban Mass Transportation Administration to test local
transit system employees for drug use, including random testing.
   The U.S. District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
said the agency had exceeded its congressionally mandated authority
in trying to impose uniform nationwide rules on local transit
authorities.
   ``We believe that Congress intended for such matters to be
handled locally with UMTA's guiding hand, not with an iron fist,''
the court said in an opinion filed by Chief Judge Patricia M. Wald.
   The decison upheld an appeal by transport unions and reversed an
earlier decision by the U.S. District Court.
   The court battle began shortly after the authority issued
regulations in December 1988 requiring all local transit systems
receiving federal funds to assure a drug-free workforce.
   The regulations, similar to rules established for transport
workers under the jurisdiction of the Department of Transportation,
called for urinalysis testing of employees before employment, after
an accident, when reasonable suspicion of drug use existed,
randomly and before an employee suspended for drug use was allowed
to return to work.
   The Amalgamated Transit Union and the Transport Workers Union of
America contended the transport agency had no authority to impose a
federal drug-testing program on all recipients of federal mass
transit money.
   Jim La Sala, president of the Amalgamated Transit Union, said
Friday that the UMTA's attempt to impose national standards was
``overkill and not sensitive to local concerns or issues.''
   ``Local unions and mass transit employers are well-suited to
themselves reach decisions on drug testing and employee assistance
programs that reflect each local situation,'' La Sala said. ``There
is no evidence of widespread drug use nationally in the mass
transit industry and the UMTA knows it.''
   The opinion said Congress had given local transit authorities,
not the federal agency, the power to submit locally designed plans
to deal with safety hazards, including drug abuse.
   A bid by the federal government to mandate ``a uniform national
plan that is not in any respect tailored to local needs and
circumstances'' cannot be squared with the language or intent of
the legislation enacted by Congress, the court said.
   ``Unless and until Congress chooses to confer such authority to
UMTA over safety matters, UMTA's uniform, national anti-drug
program regulations do not represent a valid exercise of its
statutory authority,'' the court said.

   After a four-year wait, South Korea
has authorized E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co.'s application to build
a $97 million titanium dioxide plant jointly with a local firm, the
Finance Ministry said Friday.
   Officials said the proposed plant will be capable of producing
anually 60,000 tons of titanium dioxide, a white crystaline
compound used as a paint pigment.
   The American company will put up $77.6 million and control 80
percent of the venture, with the remaining 20 percent invested by
Hanyang Chemical Corp., officials said.
   Strong opposition by local environmentalists who feared
pollution had delayed the approval. Sources said the U.S.
government recently intervened to get the project approved.
   The Ministry officials said the approval was conditioned on du
Pont burying waste from production.
   Du Pont is expected to market the product at home and abroad.
There is now one small domestic producer.
   Officials said the final approval came Thursday when the Foreign
Capital Project Review Committee met.
   Hanyang and Du Pont have yet to pick a site for the plant,
according to Hanyang officials who did not say when the plant will
begin operation. One press report said it will take about three
years to build the plant.

<HEAD>Ban Against Multiple Listings Ends Monday for New Options</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After some mixed signals from federal
regulators earlier this month, the nation's five options exchanges
are set to begin trading on new listings Monday.
   But most exchanges will be offering new options on far fewer
stocks than originally planned because the Securities and Exchange
Commission, which regulates options, hasn't changed its rules yet.
   Options are financial instruments that give holders that right
to buy or sell 100 shares of a stock at a designated price for a
certain amount of time.
   Options are traded on stocks listed on exchanges or traded over
the counter.
   Currently, most options on the stocks listed on an exchange can
only be traded in one marketplace at a time. The privilege of
trading a specific option, assigned by lottery, is not permitted on
any other exchange.
   But thanks to a rule passed by the SEC last May, that
exclusivity will end on Jan. 22.
   The new SEC rule will allow for the multiple listing of all
options.
   But earlier this month, SEC Chairman Richard C. Breeden asked
the exchanges to voluntarily limit their multiple listings to new
options while maintaining the exclusivity of listings for existing
options.
   Breeden asked the exchanges to delay phasing in the existing
options until June to allow development of some way to link all the
markets so investors can have access to the best deal.
   ``The allocation plan or lottery is abolished as of Monday for
new options,'' said Bonnie Greenberg of the Chicago Board Options
Exchange, the world's biggest options exchange.
   On Monday, the American Stock Exchange in New York will list
options in the stock of Fleet-Norstar Financial Group Inc., Racal
Telecom PLC and Sotheby's Holdings PLC.
   Options on Sotheby's also will be offered on the CBOE and the
Pacific Stock Exchange.
   But all of those exchanges had planned to list many more
options, expecting new rules that would lower the eligibility
requirements for stocks to have options listed. The SEC, however,
informed the exchanges earlier this month that the lower
requirements hadn't been approved yet and the old standards were
still in effect.
   ``We intended to trade 31 options if certain requirements were
met,'' said Roy Berces, a spokesman for the Pacific Stock Exchange.
Instead, he said, the Pacific exchange will be listing just three
options: Norwest Corp., Sundstrand Corp. and Sotheby's.
   The other options exchanges in this country are the New York
Stock Exchange and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange.

<TEXT>
   United Technologies Corp. on Friday
announced that the company is adopting a new ethics code governing
the professional conduct of the company and its 185,000 employees.
   The announcement came a little more than a year after the
defense giant came under scrutiny during a Pentagon investigation
into military procurement practices, but a company spokesman said
the probe had nothing to do with the new ethics policy.
   In outlining the plan during a meeting Friday with top
executives that was telecast to 13 UTC offices around the country,
Robert F. Daniell, UTC chairman and chief executive officer, said
the code was drafted in response to increased public attention on
corporate ethics in recent years.
   ``UTC top management and its board of directors decided that
public expectations should be addressed by issuing a code of ethics
which clearly states the corporation's principles and established
standards of conduct,'' Daniell said in a statement.
   The Pentagon's procurement investigation began in the fall of
1988 and focused on allegations that U.S. defense officials were
bribed for confidential contract information.
   UTC spokeswoman Peg Hashem said Daniell was asked by an employee
on Friday about whether the new policy was a response to the
investigation. Hashem quoting Daniell as responding ``absolutely
not.''
   ``He said that over the past several years, we have placed a lot
of emphasis on defense-related issues in the ethics area, and about
mid-year of 1989, top management began discussions about whether we
shouldn't broaden our focus and come up with a comprehensive ethics
code that we would apply across UTC, both for our commercial and
aerospace side,'' said Ms. Hashem.
   ``It's not that we didn't have an ethics code before. We did,''
she said. ``We had lots of policies addressing ethics, but this was
an effort to pull it together in a comprehensive way and we'll be
applying it consistently across UTC.''
   Pratt &amp; Whitney, the jet engine division of UTC, became a focus
of the probe amid allegations that a company official had obtained
confidential contract information from General Electric Co., a
chief competitor for military jet engine contracts. The probe,
dubbed ``Ill Wind'' by federal officials, is ongoing, a
congressional source who insisted on anonymity said Friday.
   In his remarks to employees, Daniell said the new code ``spells
out'' what the company can and cannot do in its worldwide
operations.
   ``We can and should take great pride in our reputation, and we
must commit ourselves to its continuation as the basis for our
future success,'' he said.
   Daniell also announced the formation of a new business practices
unit to oversee the new ethics code.
   The office will be made up of a network of business practices
officers at each of the company's operating units. The officers
will be available for employees to obtain information, guidance and
interpretation relating to the ethics code.
   Frank W. McAbee, former vice president-government contracts and
compliance, has been named vice president of business practices,
and will oversee the new unit and be in charge of enforcing the new
code.

   William E. Gibson, who put together one of the
initial Southwest Plan thrift rescues, has resigned as head of
American Federal Bank, the steel company that owns the institution
said Friday.
   Lone Star Technologies Inc. gave no reason for Gibson's
departure as president, chief executive officer and a director.
American Federal officials referred all calls to Lone Star
spokeswoman Judith A. Murrell, who declined to elaborate beyond an
official statement.
   Gibson, 45, was not in his office Friday and calls to his home
were not returned.
   Lone Star said American Federal's executive committee will
manage the thrift until a successor is named.
   American Federal was created in August 1988 from 12 insolvent
thrifts in one of the first applications of the Southwest Plan,
where regulators brought in capital from outside the industry to
rescue the institutions.
   The Gibson Group, which included Gibson and six others,
persuaded Lone Star to participate in the plan. Although the deal
was the fifth under the Southwest Plan, it was the first to bring
in non-traditional investors.
   Lone Star spent $48 million to acquire the institutions, which
together had assets of about $2.4 billion and liabilities of $3
billion. The federal government also provided Lone Star a $499
million note and $1.31 billion in assistance.
   According to figures from Sheshunoff Information Services Inc.
in Austin, Texas, American Federal now is the 11th-largest thrift
in the state with $3.04 billion in assets, a third of it in
repossessed assets.
   In the first nine months of 1989, American Federal earned $7.05
million. In all of 1988, earnings were $6.7 million.
   Since he took over the thrift, Gibson and American Federal have
been cited as examples of a successful transaction under the
Southwest Plan.
   Before he went to American Federal, Gibson was executive vice
president of Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Co. in
Chicago. Previously, he was a senior vice president at RepublicBank
Corp. in Dallas and had served in the Nixon administration as
senior staff economist on the Council of Economic Advisors.
   Dallas-based Lone Star is a holding company whose principal
subsidiary, Lone Star Steel Co., an oil field pipe and services
company, is operating under bankruptcy court supervision. Last year
Lone Star pared off all its subsidiaries except American Federal
and Lone Star Steel.

<HEAD>Newsletter Publishes Story After Fighting Court Order</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A business newsletter, ordered last week to halt
publication of an article containing confidential information about
a major accounting firm, sent out a special edition Friday with the
story.
   The move came one day after a New York state appellate judge
ruled that the information, already published by The New York
Times, could not be kept sealed by a lower court and ordered the
documents released to the news media.
   Arthur Bowman, editor of Bowman's Accounting Report, said the
four-page special edition contained the article about Ernst &amp; Young
he was forced to kill earlier this month. Between the time of the
restraining order Jan. 8 and the appeals court action on Thursday,
the Times also obtained the information and published a story.
   ``We have already published,'' Bowman said Friday. ``It's in the
mail.''
   The special edition of Bowman's also contains an editor's note
about the legal battle.
   ``We deeply regret finding ourselves embroiled in a legal
dispute with a respected member of the (accounting) profession,''
the message said. ``However, we also feel strongly that protection
of the First Amendment overrides other considerations.
   ``We are pleased to put this episode behind us.''
   The Atlanta newsletter's fight with Ernst &amp; Young drew the
interest of many large news organizations, several of whom joined
in support of Bowman's. Ernst &amp; Young contended that the
information in the articles was proprietary, and the firm's lawyers
compared it with Coca-Cola's secret formula.
   The news organizations, who joined Bowman's in charging that New
York Supreme Court Judge Beatrice Shainswit's original order was an
unconstitutional abridgement of press freedom, include The
Associated Press, the Society of Professsional Journalists, The New
York Times, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, The Wall Street
Journal, the Newsletter Association, the New York Daily News,
Newsday and American Lawyer.
   Also submitting a friend of the court brief on behalf of
Bowman's was the New York Civil Liberties Union.
   The Bowman's article contained information similar to that which
was in the newspaper story about the firm that resulted from the
merger of Ernst &amp; Whinney and Arthur Young.
   Among other things, the articles said Ernst &amp; Whinney partners
take home roughly 65 percent of profits earned jointly with Arthur
Young for the next three years, while Arthur Young's partners share
the rest.
   Bowman said the current newsletter was his second special
edition, the first one coming last May when he broke the story of
the Ernst &amp; Whinney-Arthur Young merger.
   The regular January edition of Bowman's had a black space with
the word ``Censored'' in the area where the Ernst &amp; Young story was
to have appeared.

   Bank of New England Corp. said Friday it expects
to report a $1.05 billion loss for 1989 and said it was ``actively
pursuing'' the sale of more than $6 billion in assets.
   The company, New England's second-largest bank holding company
after Bank of Boston Corp., issued a statement that also said it
expected to enter a consent order with federal regulators to
reshape the company's operations.
   Analysts said a mounting pile of bad real estate loans, a
reflection of the slump throughout the region, made Bank of New
England a growing target for a federal takeover.
   ``It's like `Do they survive?' time,'' said Virginia Adair, a
banking analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York. ``The
odds are increasingly slim.''
   Bank of New England's stock tumbled after the company's
announcement, falling $1.37{ to $2.87{ a share in New York Stock
trading. It was the day's most active stock, with 6.76 million
shares changing hands.
   The company said it expected to report a loss of approximately
$1.2 billion for the fourth quarter _ making its annual loss about
$1.05 billion _ after boosting its reserves against possible credit
losses to $1.65 billion.
   The company, which has seen its assets shrink in the last
quarter from around $32 billion to $29 billion, said it expected to
have $2.25 billion in non-performing assets, mostly troubled real
estate loans.
   Standard &amp; Poor's said Friday it was slightly lowering its
credit rating for Bank of New England's senior and subordinated
debt, certificates of deposit and debt issues supported by letters
of credit.
   The Wall Street credit rating agency said its action reflected
the continuing deterioration of Bank of New England's loan
portfolio. S&amp;P said the company's reserves appeared adequate to
cover ``currently identified problem assets.''
   ``Earnings prospects, however, are poor, given the high level of
nonperforming assets and pricing pressure upon the company's
financing,'' S&amp;P said in a news release. ``With reduced capital
levels, the company has little financial flexibility to address any
further deterioration in loan quality or any other problems that
may develop.''
   The recent real estate slump has hurt many banks, but analysts
said Bank of New England was one of the biggest victims because its
growth was based largely on an aggressive lending strategy during a
construction boom earlier in the 1980s.
   Analysts say the bank financed some loans that in retrospect
look questionable. Now, with the real estate market declining,
developers are having trouble making loan payments.
   The bank has come under increased scrutiny by federal
regulators. Last month, Chairman Walter Connolly said he was
relinquishing his role as chief executive officer.
   Bank of New England said Friday it expects to enter consent
orders with the Federal Reserve Board and the federal comptroller
of the currency. Dean DeBuck, a spokesman for the comptroller's
office in Washington, D.C., said the order would be issued soon,
although he declined to be specific, and said it would outline
steps the bank has to take ``to restore its weakened condition.''
   The order should contain directives to raise more capital and
improve management controls over lending, he said.
   But DeBuck said in general terms that by agreeing to sign a
consent order, a bank would not necessarily avoid a possible
federal takeover. ``It can go either way,'' he said. ``If it can
raise capital, then it strengthens the bank. If it can't raise
capital, then it doesn't strengthen the bank.''
   The bank has been trying to raise money through the sale of
assets. Earlier this week, federal regulators reportedly rejected a
tentative agreement for Bank of New England to sell some
subsidiaries to Fleet-Norstar Financial Group Inc. in Providence,
R.I.
   Analysts say the bank would have a hard time finding another
bank or investor to take over the company, and the federal
government would not likely approve the sale of its stronger
subsidiaries because that would leave the bank in worse financial
shape.
