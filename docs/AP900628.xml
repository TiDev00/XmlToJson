$1 million was the total spending reported by all New Mexico
lobbyists, of which about 80 percent was for entertainment
expenses, according to calculations by the AP.

   Pat Geiger, known around town as
``the Elvis Lady,'' has spent the past seven years keeping Elvis
Presley alive.
   Elvis the postage stamp, that is.
   From the kitchen table of her tidy, comfortable home on Route
10, Geiger runs the ``Elvis Postage Stamp Campaign.'' Her goal is
to convince the U.S. Postal Service to give ``The King'' its stamp
of approval.
   ``Without question, Elvis Presley is the perfect subject for a
U.S. commemorative postage stamp,'' Geiger said. ``He was and, even
though he left us 13 years ago, continues to be one of this
country's greatest goodwill ambassadors.''
   Her devotion may pay off. A Postal Service official says Elvis
is, indeed, still alive _ in a postal sense.
   ``There's a very good chance that sometime in the future there
will be an Elvis stamp,'' said Frank Thomas, a Postal Service
marketing specialist in Washington, D.C. ``Personally, I think
there will be.''
   The major obstacle for a Presley postage stamp is ``concern over
the lifestyle issue,'' Thomas said. The Postal Service has received
mail complaining that honoring a known drug abuser ``sends a bad
message'' to America's youth, he said.
   But Geiger scoffs at that notion, pointing to other stamp
subjects with controversial private lives. Presley stamps already
have been issued in at least seven countries, including West
Germany, she said.
   Since beginning her campaign in 1983, Geiger said she has gone
through five postmasters general and is now on her sixth, Anthony
Frank.
   Frank reportedly said soon after taking office that he supports
an Elvis stamp. But after the ensuing outcry over Presley's
well-documented drug abuse _ the King died of an overdose in 1977 _
Frank retreated and said the issue requires further review.
   His wavering prompted Geiger to publicly call him a ``wimp.''
   It also renewed her determination to honor the man she credits
with changing her life.
   ``I will not give up until either Elvis gets his stamp or I die,
whichever comes first,'' the 70-year-old great-grandmother said
over a lunchtime beer.
   To understand the extent of Geiger's passion for Presley, one
must visit her house. It is wall-to-wall _ and floor-to-ceiling _
Elvis. Posters line every wall, most highlighting Presley's 1970s
jumpsuit phase.
   Bookcases are stuffed with Presley tomes, both reverential and
scandalous. Shelves burst with videocassettes of Presley movies,
and photo albums hold thousands of pictures. That's not including
her records and tapes.
   The first Presley picture Geiger bought, a black-and-white shot
taken at a 1969 press conference, will be buried with her, she vows.
   ``Pictures are my addiction,'' Geiger said, then adds, ``Pardon
me, Evis, for using that word.''
   Presleymania came late in Geiger's life. Although her older son
dressed in pink and black in the 1950s to emulate Presley, Geiger
did not convert until a 1968 TV show known as the ``Comeback
Special.''
   ``I looked at that man in that black leather suit and said
`Phew!,''' Geiger said. ``I sat in that chair and said, `Nobody is
that good looking.' It was kind of sudden. I was never the same
after that night.''
   The postage stamp entered her life in 1983, when a fellow
Presley fan mentioned the idea. After some investigating, Geiger
learned ordinary citizens are not eligible for stamp consideration
until 10 years after their deaths.
   So Geiger spent the next several years laying the groundwork for
her big 1987 push.
   ``I thought it would be a simple thing,'' she said. ``Boy, was I
naive.''
   Postal Service officials have come to know Geiger well, Thomas
said. She is, in fact, one of their best customers, firing off
letters to anybody connected with the agency.
   ``You name `em, I've written to 'em,'' she said, waving a wrist
adorned with an Elvis Presley watch.
   Commemorative postage stamps are nominated by the 15-member
Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee, which meets every two months,
and then must be approved by the postmaster general, Thomas said.
   Although Presley has been eligible for three years, he still has
not been chosen for the honor. Does this mean Elvis _ the stamp _
is dead?
   ``No, not at all,'' Thomas said.
   The committee might include Presley in a stamp series on
American musicians, but that doesn't sit well with Geiger.
   ``Elvis was one of a kind! There will never be another!'' she
said. ``He does not fit into a group!''
   The committee will announce next year's commemorative stamps
within a month, Thomas said.
   ``If they don't announce it, that doesn't mean it won't show up
in 1991,'' he said. ``The fact that they're spending so much time
on the subject is a positive sign.''
   Meanwhile, Geiger waits impatiently and spends her days mostly
on Presley-related matters. There are the constant letters from
supporters around the world, the radio appearances, the newspaper
interviews.
   ``How did I get here? I absolutely do not know,'' she said.
``Next to my children, he's the most important person in my life. I
don't know what I'd do if there wasn't an Elvis.''

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Not far from Satan's Alley and a dead-end street
called God, 48 families live in a public square. They are victims
of a war on squatters waged by a city of plenty with little room
for its poor.
   Since March 15, when a winter moratorium on evictions ended,
riot police arriving before dawn have cleared dozens of buildings.
   The evictions inspire denunciations, demonstrations and charges
that the city of Paris, where housing prices are soaring, is trying
to push the poor out of town.
   ``We're miserable here because we have nothing,'' said Assa Kan,
a 30-year-old woman from Mali with six children. They are among 150
people who have lived under tents since May 2 in the Place de la
Reunion.
   ``At night, it's really cold,'' she said, caressing the chapped
cheeks of her 4-month-old daughter. ``All the children are sick.''
   Hers is the largest of three camps set up by squatters or
renters turned out of condemned buildings. Nine families camp at
the foot of Sacre Coeur, the Montmartre basilica, and six live
outside a city government office.
   In announcing the spring offensive, Paris officials said
squatting had reached ``inadmissible'' proportions.
   ``The city is duty-bound to solve this problem'' and evictions
are ``the only way to stop the multiplication of squatters,'' said
Jean Tiberi, deputy to Mayor Jacques Chirac.
   Within days, 300 people were homeless, nearly half of them
children.
   ``These people had a right to squat,'' said Abbe Pierre, a
bearded Roman Catholic cleric who is France's premier champion of
the needy. ``When a man is hungry, he has the right to take bread
from the baker.''
   Abbe Pierre's humanitarian organization, the Emmaus Community,
provided tents for those evicted.
   A siege mentality prevails in the Place de la Reunion, which is
ringed with rosebushes and dotted with orange and blue tents.
   Amenities consist of one water spigot, three portable toilets
like those used at construction sites, and intermittent lighting at
night via an extension cord from a nearby cafe. One tent serves as
a kitchen.
   Mrs. Kan and others said they would remain until the city
provided a suitable alternative.
   ``We are confronted with the unacceptable,'' Bertrand Main,
deputy chief of the League of Human Rights, told reporters.
``Demands for rehousing are met with a wall of silence,
incomprehension and, sometimes, contempt.''
   Paris proposed temporary housing for the evicted in buildings
scheduled for demolition in St. Denis, a poor northern suburb.
Officials there objected.
   ``We don't have a money problem in Paris; we have a problem of
land,'' Tiberi, the deputy mayor, said in explaining the housing
shortage on French radio.
   ``For moral reasons ... we cannot accept the principle of
rehousing squatters,'' who rob legal occupants of apartment space,
he said.
   At a news conference, Abbe Pierre said: ``It is a crime to
refuse lodging in a city like Paris, where several thousand
apartments are vacant.''
   The Committee Against Poor Housing, a protest group that finds
vacant buildings for squatters, claims there are 3,000 to 4,000
vacant, government-subsidized Moderate Rent Housing units around
Paris. The city denies it.
   Officials say the number of buildings occupied by squatters,
most of them Africans, has grown from 36 to 187 in three years and
41 of the buildings are subsidized units, which have a waiting list
of 50,000.
   Mayor Chirac said in a letter to Abbe Pierre, made public June
20, that rehousing evicted squatters would be a ``profound
injustice'' to people on the waiting list. ``Paris is a city with
heart,'' he said, ``but ... neither the capital nor the Paris
region can take in all the misery of the world.''
   Critics claim the city is being transformed into a ghetto for
the elite.
   President Francois Mitterrand denounced those ``who enrich
themselves while sleeping'' because they own ``a good piece of land
or a nice apartment.''
   Prices have risen so quickly, he said, ``that they are starting
to exclude the possibility of suitable lodging for senior
executives with salaries that can reach 50,000 francs per month,''
about $8,700.
   Frederica Koch and Amina Amara are among those keeping a vigil
with the homeless at the Place de la Reunion.
   Ms. Koch was evicted last year from the rent-controlled
apartment she occupied for 25 years and, at 58, is a squatter. She
lost her job as a clothes cutter during a 10-year battle to keep
her home.
   Ms. Amara, a single woman with five children, has been on a
waiting list for a low-rent apartment for 15 years. After eviction
from one building, she and her two youngest children spent a year
in a shabby hotel and two months in a restaurant basement before
squatting anew in December.
   ``This problem is too big for us,'' said Berhima Tembely, an
immigrant from Senegal who paid a sympathy visit to the square.
``The rich people are treating us like dogs. You have to fight to
live in this world.''

   Get ready for a plateful of soul _ more hot
sounds from ``Hot-lanta.''
   Atlanta in the 1990s is emerging as the new center for rhythm
and blues, just as Detroit did in the '60s with Motown.
   Recording artists are flocking to the South's capital from New
York and Los Angeles, drawn by a cheaper real estate market and
more privacy.
   ``Atlanta was one of the country's best-kept secrets,'' said Tom
Wright, owner of Cheshire Sound Studios, where singers such as
Peabo Bryson and Bobby Brown come to record. ``Not anymore.''
   Bryson was new in the music business and Atlanta seemed like a
good place to start. So when the relatively unknown Bang records
offered him a contract, he snapped it up. Nineteen years later,
he's still here, after raising a family and building a prosperous
career.
   ``Atlanta was not a throbbing metropolis full of opportunity in
the recording industry, but it was also not a New York City _ all
crowded,'' Bryson said in an interview.
   ``I wanted to develop my writing style here, learn to make
recordings. Now the producers are here, the equipment is here. I'm
glad I stayed.''
   Bryson was joined last year by Brown, the former New Edition
member whose multiplatinum album, ``Don't Be Cruel,'' sst bakes under the
summer sun, winter is arriving in earnest in southern Australia,
with heavy snowfalls, high winds and hail causing traffic havoc in
some areas.
   In Sydney, strong winds uprooted trees and snapped power lines
on Wednesday night, cutting power to hundreds of families in the
city's north and southeast. Marine police were kept busy on Sydney
Harbor after boats broke their moorings.
   Some highways were closed by snow and sleet in highland areas of
New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania states.
   A Weather Bureau spokesman said the high temperature was just 49
degrees in Melbourne on Wednesday, the city's lowest June maximum
in four years.
   A gale warning was in effect for all Victorian and Tasmanian
coastal waters. Some areas reported winds of up to 60 mph on
Wednesday night.
   Heavy snowfalls and blizzards were reported at ski resorts in
northeastern Victoria state, and more rough weather was in the
forecast.
   A spokesman for the Bureau of Meteorology in Tasmania, an island
state off Australia's southern coast, said temperatures in the
capital, Hobart, had dipped almost 9 degrees below average to a
minimum of 36 degrees.

<HEAD>With PM-Heat-Fires, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The scorching heat wave in the Southwest is taking its toll.
Here are some tips to beat the heat:
   People most at risk in hot weather are those suffering from such
conditions as diabetes, heart disease, blood vessel disease,
stroke, burns, alcoholism or obesity.
   Persons who have reduced capacity to sweat also may have
problems in the heat, as will those with diarrhea, who can easily
become dehydrated. In hot weather, plan to reduce physical
activity, and when outside stay in the shade or wear a wide-brimmed
hat or use an umbrella to keep out of the sun. Park the car in a
shady area and roll down the windows to let the hot air out before
getting into it. And dress coolly, in light-colored loose-fitting
clothes.
   Use air conditioners or electric fans when possible. If these
are not available, go to an air-conditioned library, movie or
shopping mall during the heat of the day.
   Bathing or showering in cool water helps, as will drinking
plenty of liquids. But avoid alcohol, coffee, tea or other drinks
that cause fluid loss. Do not take salt tablets unless recommended
by a doctor.
   Too much heat can lead to heat cramps, heat exhaustion and
finally heat stroke. Here is a rundown on these three problems:
   _Heat stroke is the most dangerous heat-related illness and it
requires emergency treatment. Often the victim can no longer sweat
and immediate help is needed to reduce the temperature and prevent
serious damage.
   Symptoms include a body temperature of 104 degrees and higher;
dizziness, faintness or unconsciousness; sometimes hot, dry or
reddened skin; staggering; possible diarrhea; rapid pulse;
confusion; headache and agitation.
   First aid begins with calling for emergency medical help. Cool
the victim by removing as much clothing as possible and sponging
the skin with cool, not cold, water. If the victim is conscious,
give sips of liquid, but if unconscious do not force liquid. Get
the victim to a hospital immediately.
   _Heat exhaustion is the most common heat-related illness.
   Symptoms include clammy or sweaty skin, normal or slightly
elevated temperature, dizziness or feeling faint, profuse
perspiration, rapid pulse, nausea and thirst.
   First aid includes rest in a cool location where you can sit or
lie down. Restore fluids by slowly drinking liquids, and gently
apply wet towels to the body. Check with a physician to see if salt
or medication is needed.
   _Heat cramps are the least serious of the heat-related
illnesses, but if not treated they can lead to more serious
problems. Heat cramps usually occur after exercise or physical
labor in the heat.
   Symptoms are sweaty skin, possible weakness or nausea,
occasional tingling in the arms and legs, and muscle cramps, often
beginning in the abdomen and legs.
   First aid includes getting out of the sun and into a cool place;
lying down and drinking cool liquids. Check with a physician to see
if salt or medication is needed.

   Construction workers excavating a
building site near Parliament dug out a mound of rubble containing
a 2,200-pound U.S. bomb but didn't discover the ``live'' World War
II relic until later, officials say.
   The bomb went undetected Tuesday until it was being unloaded at
a dump site along the highway connecting Bonn to Cologne, city
officials in Cologne said. It had been driven in a dump truck from
the construction site through Bonn.
   Bomb experts were immediately called, sealed off the area and
safely defused the bomb.
   According to an aerial photograph of the construction site,
officials said the bomb had been buried about 12 feet deep in what
is now the government center of Bonn.
   Since the end of World War II, thousands of tons of unexploded
bombs and other munitions left over from the war have been
uncovered in Germany, and bomb experts are regularly called out to
defuse them to prevent injuries to the public.

<HEAD>Geologists Find Evidence That Islands Once Linked</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marine geologists say they have
found evidence of a huge land bridge that linked New Zealand's
North and South islands during the peak of the last ice age 20,000
years ago.
   Since the 1950s, scientists have believed that a very narrow
land bridge once existed that would explain the discovery on the
North Island of rocks and remains from animals thought to be unique
to the South Island.
   But recent survey work by Department of Scientific and
Industrial Research marine geologists suggests that the bridge was
a broad, windswept plain, fanned by numerous rivers which fed the
bridge with sediment.
   It probably had a open, seaward-facing western shoreline,
battered by a harsh climate of storms and strong southwesterly
winds.
   Scientist Scott Nodder said recently that based on the
preliminary work, he believes the bridge probably was exposed
during a time when sea levels were low, during the peak of the last
ice age.
   As the ice age waned, the bridge was breached at its most
shallow point about 15,000 years ago, creating the Cook Strait.
   Nodder said he has used a combination of core sampling and echo
sounders to survey below the sea floor. That has revealed a
combination of sediments and a sequence of sea beds that lend
weight to he huge land bridge theory.

   Americans under age 30 know less about what's
going on in the country and the world than any other generation in
the past 50 years, according to a study of how people keep up with
the news.
   It found that younger Americans are less likely than earlier
generations to have read a newspaper or watched a television news
show.
   When people under age 35 were asked 25 years ago whether they
had read a newspaper ``yesterday,'' 67 percent said yes. When the
same question was put this year to a slightly younger group, people
under age 30, only 24 percent said yes.
   Television news-watching has dropped, too. In 1965, 52 per cent
of people under 35 said they watched the TV news ``yesterday'';
this year, 41 percent of those under 30 said they caught the TV
news ``yesterday.''
   The study said that from 1941 to 1975, young Americans were on a
par with their elders in public knowledge and in following most
major news events closely. But since 1975, younger people have been
less attentive and the trend is accelerating, it said.
   ``The Information Age has spawned ... an uninformed and
uninvolved population,'' concludes the study. It was conducted by
the Times Mirror Center for the People and the Press, sponsored by
the company which publishes the Los Angeles Times. The center's own
polls and those of four other polling organizations taken over the
years were analyzed.
   Even though the average 30-year-old is more likely to use a
computer, to have attended college and even more likely to be
reading a book than someone 20 years senior, the younger generation
knows less about the world, the study said.
   In the latest measurement, 12,000 random sample interviews
conducted between May 1989 and last March were analyzed. The number
of young people who could correctly answer questions about current
news was at its lowest level since pollsters started asking
questions about familiarity with the news in the early 1940s. The
polls had a margin or error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.
   ``Social scientists and pollsters have long recognized that
younger people have usually been somewhat less attuned to politics
and serious issues,'' the study said. ``But the difference now is
more striking than ever before.''
   ``The Army-McCarthy hearings, Watergate and Vietnam were stories
followed closely by young and old alike. However, since the mid-70s
young people have shown much less interest in most news, including
the biggest stories with the most far-reaching implications.''
   The exceptions: sports news and the abortion issue. There, the
young match their elders in news interest.
   In 1989, 25 percent of each group kept up with the World Series;
41 percent of the young and 33 percent of people over 50 knew about
the Supreme Court's most recent major abortion ruling.
   But, the survey reported, younger Americans are 20 percent less
likely than those over 30 to know who won the recent election in
Nicaragua, what happened to Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu or
what the Soviet Union's role has been in the political upheavals of
Eastern Europe.
   The study said that in the 1940s a majority of people _ both
those under and those over 30 _ could identify Norman Thomas, the
American socialist. And in the 1960s two-thirds of young people and
59 percent over those over 50 could identify Earl Warren, the chief
justice of the United States from 1953 to 1969.
   By contrast, in a March, 1990 survey, less than a quarter of
people under 30 and less than half of those over 50 could identify
Jim Wright, who resigned a year ago as speaker of the House of
Representatives, or Helmut Kohl, chancellor of West Germany.
   A newspaper editor, William B. Ketter of the Quincy (Mass.)
Patriot Ledger, called the findings distressing.
   ``I think it is symptomatic of our fast-food, fast-paced society
where they want everything instantly and don't want to concentrate
on newspapers, and apparently that even extends now to
television,'' said Ketter. He is chairman of the Readership
Committee of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, which is
seeking ways to make newspapers more attractive to readers.
   ``I call it a dangerous camel under the tent because I think if
our society becomes less informed about the events that go on in
the world and at home it becomes less vigilant for the protections
of the Constitution, and that could spell problems,'' Ketter said.

   East Germany will bid goodbye to an old
currency by burying it in salt mines and feeding it to foundries,
clearing the way for new cash and a radically different way of life.
   At the stroke of midnight Saturday, the 42-year-old East German
mark of the ousted Communist regime will be replaced by one of the
free market's most powerful forces, the West German mark.
   An East German who buys a beer with his old money in the minutes
before midnight could have his change brought back in West German
marks, so quick is this change to take place.
   That modest event would signal the economic unification of the
two German states, the end of four decades of East German socialism
and the de facto creation of a single Germany.
   The West German state bank, the Bundesbank, has trucked in 25
billion uncirculated West German marks, said spokesman Sigfried
Guterman in Frankfurt.
   ``Transporting money is our business,'' he said Wednesday.
``This was a little more complicated.''
   Guterman said heavily guarded trucks from Bundesbank offices
throughout West Germany brought 600 tons of paper money _ 400
million individual bills _ and 500 tons of coins during the past
two months.
   The money was distributed to 15 different cities. The East
German State Bank has been taking that money to 10,000 different
locations, where it will be available to East Germans beginning
Sunday.
   Long lines at banks nationwide continued as East Germans filled
out forms to convert their savings accounts to West German marks.
   Guterman said there have been no major problems replacing one
currency with another virtually overnight.
   The 25 billion in West German marks is new, uncirculated cash
that should be enough to accomodate the nation, Guterman said.
   East Germany now only has 12.3 billion East German marks in
circulation, said Bernd Schroeter, spokesman for the East German
State Bank.
   All citizens will be asked to deposit their remaining East
German cash in banks by July 6. There, it is to be counted, sorted
and wrapped.
   After final inventory, the bills will be stored in salt mines
pending their later destruction, Schroeter said.
   East Germany is not equipped to burn large amounts of bills in
environmentally safe ways, he said. Guterman said East Germany
might have to use the Bundesbank facilities to burn the money.
   Most of the coins are pure aluminum _ which drew chuckles from
Westerners _ and two denominations are in copper. Schroeter said
these will be melted down and recycled.
   The East German currency is small and flimsy compared with the
large West German bills.
   The 50-mark bill carries the picture of Friedrich Engels, who
with Karl Marx drafted the blueprint for modern socialism. The back
depicts a giant factory spewing smoke.
   The East German currency was non-convertible and virtually
worthless outside the East bloc. After the East German revolt last
autumn, it was traded on the black market at a 20-1 rate for West
German money.
   Now, small savings accounts will be traded at a 1-1 rate, with
larger amounts converted at a 2-1 rate.
   The Bundesbank has been planning a new West German currency for
years, and will begin circulating some notes on Oct. 1. By the end
of the next year, Guterman said, all the current money will be
replaced.
   Concidentally, one of the first bills that goes into circulation
on Oct. 1 _ the 100 mark note _ will depict the East German city of
Leipzig.
   ``It is more or less by accident,'' Guterman said. ``Nobody knew
there would be a currency union when these bills were designed.''
   Leipzig is on the back of the bill because it is the birthplace
of the person on the front, 19th century German pianist Clara
Schumann. Leipzig is also the home of the an East German currency
mint, and Guterman said it will be used to print part of the new 5
mark note.

<HEAD>Government Extends State of Emergency in Peru</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has extended a state of
emergency for 60 more days in a third of the Peru's territory,
giving the military broad powers to fight leftist guerrillas.
   The move comes a month before Alberto Fujimori's inauguration as
president and affects eight states and one province. Peru is
divided into 24 states, which are sub-divided into provinces.
   The state of emergency applies to the states of Apurimac,
Ayacucho, Huancavelica, Junin, Pasco, Huanuco, San Martin and
Ucayali. It also covers Ucayali province in Loreto state.
   The decree puts the areas _ in Peru's central and southern
highlands and northern jungle _ under military control and allows
authorities to restrict freedom of movement, detain people without
charge and conduct searches without warrants.
   Lima, the capital and home to a third of Peru's 22 million
people, also is under a state of emergency. But it is administered
by the national police.
   Political violence related to the decade-old Shining Path
insurgency has killed more than 18,500 people.
   The government first imposed the state of emergency in December
1982 in Ayacucho, birthplace of the rebel movement. The measure has
since been steadily extended to other areas as the rebel violence
has expanded.

<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   California's lampooned and lauded
self-esteem task force goes out of business Sunday, but its backers
feel really good about its accomplishments.
   Its creator, state Assemblyman John Vasconcellos, says the task
force ``brought self-esteem from an object of ridicule to a subject
of respect _ throughout our state, across our nation and even now
around our entire world.
   ``Self-esteem, formerly only cautiously addressed in the privacy
of therapeutic encounters and personal growth weekends, has now
become legitimate and mainstream, in conversation and in
practice,'' said Vasconcellos, a Democrat from San Jose.
   Virginia and Maryland created their own task forces last year
and several other states are considering it. Forty-nine of
California's 58 counties now have their own self-esteem task forces.
   Vasconcellos will present the task force work to the annual
convention of the National Conference of State Legislators in
Nashville, Tenn., in August. The same month, the First
International Conference on Self Esteem is scheduled in Oslo,
Norway.
   The California task force's 144-page report, ``Toward a State of
Esteem,'' has sold more than 20,000 copies at $4 each since coming
out in January. The report defines self-esteem as ``appreciating my
own worth and importance and having the character to be accountable
for myself and to act responsibly toward others.''
   While the law creating California's task force expires on July
1, Vasconcellos has plenty of plans for the future.
   ``It's a conclusion of a phase, like a commencement,'' he said.
   A bill moving through the Legislature would create a state
ombudsperson for self-esteem to monitor state agencies and see if
they're following the task force recommendations. Another bill
would provide $100,000 to the non-profit National Council for Self
Esteem so it can replace the task force as a clearinghouse for
self-esteem information.
   Vasconcellos became interested in the subject nearly a decade
ago, partly because of his ``own painful personal struggle _
despite repeated successes and achievements in my life _ to develop
my own self-esteem.''
   Also, as chairman of the Assembly's budget-writing Ways and
Means Committee, he saw the state pour billions into ``too-little,
too-late efforts to confine and-or repair our fellow Californians.''
   He proposed a self-esteem commission in 1984. It took until
1986, and one veto, to get lawmakers and Gov. George Deukmejian to
agree. The California Task Force to Promote Self-Esteem and
Personal and Social Responsibility was given a three-year life, at
$245,000 a year.
   Shortly before its first meeting in April 1987, cartoonist Garry
Trudeau spent three weeks lampooning the task force. In his
``Doonesbury'' comic strip, the airhead character ``Boopsie,'' an
actress and out-of-body traveler, was named to the task force.
Trudeau pulled out all the California jokes about new-age music,
hot tubs and reincarnation.
   The nation laughed, but the task force members were not angry.
   ``The `Doonesbury' thing was a curious thing that made us
famous, that gave us a national audience immediately that we could
not have bought,'' Vasconcellos said.
   The task force went to work, with few further sniggers and a
growing respect. It produced a report listing effective self-esteem
programs in California, such as teaching arts in state prisons and
giving self-esteem training to welfare recipients in Napa County.
   Its 46 recommendations range from making child-rearing courses
more available to requiring teachers to have self-esteem training,
to reducing class sizes.
   But Vasconcellos in his budget-writing role is faced with a
1990-91 state budget with a potential $3.6 billion shortfall and no
money for new programs.
   ``It's ironic and frustrating. The saving grace is a lot of this
doesn't cost any money. It's a change of attitude in people
operating current programs,'' he said. ``Some money is needed to
support self-esteem education. It would be helpful and a great
investment.''
   All the task force members but one signed the report, although
seven wrote slightly critical comments. The non-signer, David
Shannahoff-Khalsa, a Del Mar neuroscience researcher and yoga
teacher, said self-esteem cannot be injected or given to anyone.
   Other critics say the report only lists common sense conclusions.
   ``It could have been figured out, but it hadn't been,'' responds
Vasconcellos. ``But the truth is we have created a national
awareness and I never thought we would come so far so fast.''
   He said the task force is stimulating further research and new
programs seeking to determine if self-esteem is mostly innate or
can be learned.
   ``There's a chicken-egg quality to it. We're learning about it.
We have lots more to learn. The hope is we're asking the right
questions, finally.''

   Marion Barry slapped ex-model Rasheeda Moore
to the floor after they smoked cocaine, and he appeared indifferent
when she nearly passed out after a ``big hit'' of crack, she
testified at the mayor's drug and perjury trial.
   Moore said Wednesday that she and Barry used cocaine powder,
crack and opium more than 100 times in 15 private homes, a
restaurant and four hotels from 1986 to 1989. She said they were
lovers during most of that time.
   Moore depicted Barry as a man whose life was so consumed by
drugs that he had her deliver cocaine to him at the mayor's office.
They broke off their romance but continued to get together
frequently to smoke crack, she said.
   Prosecutors were expected to use Moore's testimony to introduce
as evidence an FBI videotape made last Jan. 18 when Barry allegedly
smoked crack cocaine while visiting Moore at a Washington hotel.
She was cooperating in an undercover sting operation that led to
his arrest that night.
   Moore testified Wednesday that at a home after one crack-smoking
session, Barry ``said he was addicted ... to cocaine.''
   ``He was tired, he wanted to quit'' and had ``started going to
church,'' she said. The mayor was ``talking about getting his
spiritual life together.''
   Barry, 54, has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor
cocaine-possession charges, one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy
charge, and three felony charges of lying to a grand jury about his
alleged drug use. One possession charge stems from the night of his
arrest.
   The three-term mayor stared intently Wednesday as the
39-year-old Moore described their relationship. Barry's wife, Effi,
sat in the front row of the spectator section, her face growing
grim as the day wore on.
   Moore said that at Barry's request one day in 1988, she bought
$40 worth of crack and carried it in a bag to his office.
   ``The mayor was expecting me,'' she testified. ``I gave him the
cocaine, he gave me the money for it and I left.''
   At the mayor's suggestion, the two smoked crack at Barry's home,
she said, and also smoked crack at her mother's home on Mother's
Day.
   On another occasion, she said, Barry nearly passed out in the
basement of her mother's home after taking what he later described
to her as ``a really great hit.''
   During city budget briefings in 1988, Moore said, Barry passed
her money to buy cocaine. She testified that she left, bought the
drugs, returned to the municipal building and ``waited for the
mayor to finish his budget hearings'' so that the two could ``go
out and use the crack.''
   She said Barry became violent after one session in a hotel room
where they smoked crack through a homemade pipe. The mayor accused
her of having a relationship with another man and ``slapped me,''
Moore said.
   She returned the slap, she said, but ``ended up on the floor''
when Barry slapped her again.
   While she was on the floor, Barry stood over her and said ``I
haven't hit a woman in 20 years. You bring the worst out in a
man,'' she testified.
   Another time, Moore said she started to pass out after ``I took
a big hit'' during a crack-smoking spree with the mayor in the
bathroom of a church leader's home.
   She said she cried out ``Marion, Marion, (but) ... all of a
sudden he turned the light off'' and wandered out of the bathroom
while she stood there in front of the mirror.
   She recovered her senses and followed Barry, who ``was moving
very slowly.'' Moore said she asked him why he turned off the
light, and he replied, ``I couldn't do anything, there was nothing
I could do.''
   ``I could have died,'' she told the court. ``It was just
insanity.''
   She said the mayor's security guards were aware of her drug
purchases, occasionally passing her money in envelopes from Barry
to buy cocaine.
   ``I hope you're not going to be bad tonight,'' she quoted one of
Barry's guards, James Stays, as quipping to her as she went out to
make a drug buy.
   Moore began cooperating with the government after her arrest in
California for drunken driving. She has been in the federal witness
protection program since Jan. 29 because of threats on her life,
Assistant U.S. Attorney Judith Retchin told the judge.

   Wynton Marsalis and Pearl Bailey were an unusual
pairing for a jazz concert and, sure enough, the two halves of the
evening were opposites.
   Singer Bailey was show business Wednesday night, talking folksy
and amusingly and strutting around between songs. Marsalis and his
band went the other direction, playing two long suites of composed,
structured jazz in an hour.
   As a finale, when Bailey sang ``The Battle Hymn of the
Republic,'' Marsalis came out and played trumpet along with her and
her quartet. It gave the evening a pleasingly unified feeling it
certainly hadn't had before.
   Moments before, Bailey sang ``Hello, Dolly!'' and announced this
was her last concert before having a knee-replacement operation.
   Before that came the musical high point of the evening, a long
drum solo by Louie Bellson in ``After You've Gone'' that was a
marvel of sound, fire, subtlety and musicality.
   Marsalis and his band began the JVC Jazz Festival concert at
Avery Fisher Hall with ``Uptown Ruler Suite'' and a suite about a
man and woman, Sugar Cane and Sweetie Pie. The first piece was
cerebral and the second more lively and swinging. Marsalis may
aspire to be the Duke Ellington of today, presenting new jazz
suites and tone poems.
   One could remain interested in these two pieces if one tried _
both had lots of instrumental solos _ but they didn't reach out and
grab you like Ellington's bursts of melody and changing moods. Even
for a jazz festival audience, Marsalis might do better to program
only one of these per evening.
   His band is fantastic. Marsalis' articulate solos were
understated but gained strength because of it.
   The other musicians are Todd Williams and Wessell Anderson,
saxophonists; trombonist Wycliff Gordon, pianist Eric Reid, drummer
Herlin Riley and bassist Reginald Veal.
   Bellson played drums for Bailey and Paul Smith was at piano,
Keeter Betts on d reaching down from the stage to shake hands. She
flung the microphone cord around and gestured with graceful hands.
   She began with ``On the Road Again,'' sang ``Unforgettable'' in
a quietly serious way as a tribute to Nat ``King'' Cole, was
fervent on ``For Once in My Life.'' Her distinctive voice was
strong and true in ``Can You Read My Mind?''.
   Just when one was getting impatient with the show biz patter,
Bailey said, ``Oh, Pearl, you are forever young.'' For that
infectiously upbeat statement, one is quite won over.

   Dr. Stuart Wiles is committed above all
to the 60,000 mice, pigs, rats, rabbits, monkeys and dogs that are
part of this city's $100 million-a-year animal research business.
   But the nation's first commissioner of laboratory animals also
must protect the interests of science in a city that is home to the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University.
   Wiles doesn't have an office yet and hasn't started making spot
checks, but he has made contact with the 23 laboratories he became
responsible for May 7 under a new city ordinance.
   For animal-rights activists, Wiles' appointment represents a
victory in their battle to ensure humane lives and, when the time
comes, painless deaths for lab animals.
   ``I feel for the animals,'' said Wiles, 56, a veterinarian
trained at Boston's Angell Memorial Animal Hospital. ``But I also
understand the scientific perspective.''
   This balance is key to Wiles' popularity both with researchers
and with moderate animal-rights activists, who allow that
laboratory experiments are necessary but say they must be conducted
under controlled conditions.
   ``If you're going to have a commissioner, it seems we've got a
guy who's going to be fair-minded and who understands all the
issues,'' Ron Suduiko, assistant to MIT's president, said Wednesday.
   Wiles has seen the issue from both sides. He's a longtime animal
lover who founded a veterinary hospital in rural Massachusetts and
started his career as a supervisor at a Harvard research center.
   He served on a commission that developed the new ordinance,
which a year ago won 8-0 approval from the City Council. The law
has also served as a model for proposed ordinances in Lowell,
Mass., and Evanston, Ill.
   Members of the medical and biotechnology community have
generally accepted the ordinance, which was developed after
animal-rights activists alleged possible laboratory abuse and the
city launched an investigation.
   The city found lab conditions humane but suggested a
commissioner's post be established to ensure that standards are
maintained.
   Wiles will inspect academic and private laboratories, which
could face fines of $300 a day for violations such as unkempt cages
or improperly executed euthanasia.
   Each laboratory must have an animal-care committee that includes
a non-affiliated member, who will be screened and monitored by
Wiles.
   It will be his job to make sure these independent members _ who
include a nun, lawyer and dance teacher _ understand and meet their
responsibilities.
   ``I'll provide them with guidelines to follow when considering a
proposed research project,'' he said. ``Questions like: `Is it
worth it? What are the project's goals? Do you have to use 150 mice
or can you get by with 50?'''
   Federal law protects dogs, cats and monkeys but excludes
reptiles, amphibians, mice, rats and rabbits. The Cambridge
ordinance will cover all research animals.
   Suduiko said Cambridge researchers have been concerned that the
ordinance might impede their work on diseases such as AIDS and
cancer.
   But Wiles has no plans to ``create a bureaucratic situation or
be picky about the little things,'' like an errant piece of garbage
or a slightly lethargic mouse.
   ``I'm looking at the bigger picture,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Countries hit by unrelenting
waves of Vietnamese refugees are getting tougher _ the boat people
increasingly face being pushed back to sea or returned to this
Communist land they risked their lives to flee.
   Aid officials say Malaysia took in more than 16,000 Vietnamese
in 1989 but rebuffed about 8,700 others in the past year,
indirectly causing some deaths.
   Other Southeast Asian nations implicity have threatened the same
unless the United States by July 1 stops opposing the forced
repatriation of those Vietnamese judged to be economic migrants.
   More than 117,000 Vietnamese refugees fill camps in the region.
   ``It is now the 11th hour for the Vietnamese boat people,'' Rep.
Hamilton Fish, R-N.Y., told a Congressional hearing on June 21.
``If first asylum is to be retained, it must be at the
uncomfortable price of re-examining the question of involuntary
repatriation.''
   Despite the increasing hostility, there appears little let-up in
the exodus of more than 1.5 million people since the Communists
toppled the U.S.-backed government of South Vietnam in April 1975.
   The desire to flee is so that strong Western officials commonly
talk of Vietnam's ``exodus mentality.''
   ``If you go to some of the provinces in the south, leaving by
boat is part of life there,'' said Kai Nielsen, representative of
the United Nations High Commissioner For Refugees in Ho Chi Minh
City _ formerly the South Vietnamese capital of Saigon.
   ``People get arrested every day for trying to leave. There are
some people who have tried 10 to 15 times,'' Nielsen said.
   ``In my age group, all my friends are leaving by boat,'' said a
government employee, 30, who may follow them. ``A close friend who
left in 1979 and came back to visit last year said it's very sad to
live outside your native land, but it's better to be in a country
where you can study and have a job.''
   At risk is the collapse of the Comprehensive Plan of Action on
refugees adopted a year ago at an international conference in
Geneva.
   The plan committed countries to give refuge to all boat people,
who are then screened to separate political refugees from economic
migrants. Western countries are to resettle the refugees.
   But the large majority are economic migrants who will strain the
region's camps indefinitely because the United States and Vietnam
oppose their forced return. That and the arrival of 16,718
Vietnamese in 1989 _ an eight-year high _turned Malaysia from one
of the most generous asylum nations into the most heartless.
   ``The perception is that there is little to lose in breaking the
rules and a big price to pay for following them,'' said a Western
diplomat.
   A total of 11,722 Vietnamese arrived in the region the first
four months of this year, down from 18,351 the same period last
year, according to U.N. figures. That brought the camp population
to more than 117,000.
   Hong Kong, after a crisis-level influx in 1989, experienced an
83 percent decrease in arrivals the first five months compared to
the same period last year. But arrivals in Indonesia shot up 450
percent as boats evicted by Malaysia landed there, and arrivals in
Thailand increased 385 percent.
   Indonesia has been accused of giving supplies to a new wave of
boat people, Cambodians fleeing their Vietnamese-installed regime,
so they can sail onto Australia.
   The Philippines, another generous asylum country that has
hardened, recently let 343 Vietnamese disembark from U.S. and
Canadian warships that had rescued them only after getting
assurances they would be resettled abroad by 1992. A Singaporean
ship was bounced between Taiwan, Hong Kong and Thailand because
authorities wouldn't accept the 17 Vietnamese aboard.
   Southeast Asia and Britain, Hong Kong's colonial ruler, have
castigated the United States for opposing forced return yet
refusing to house the boat people on its own territory. Washington
says it opposes force until there are ``dramatic'' economic, social
and political improvements in Vietnam.
   Some diplomats said that guilt over U.S. involvement in the
Vietnam War prompted Washington to welcome those who flee. They
said vengeance prompted it to treat Vietnam as an outcast to which
it was not moral to return migrants.
   But one diplomat said Washington could compromise on what the
Vietnamese call the ``gray area'' between forced and voluntary
repatriation _ people who are ``not actively opposed to
returning.'' He said such people won't state they want to return
but would not protest if put on flights back home.
   Diplomats said Vietnam opposes forced repatriation to project an
acceptable world image and to maintain efforts to establish
diplomatic ties with the United States. Those forced back also pose
security problems.
   Hanoi accepted a group of 51 forced back from Hong Kong in
December, but has refused any more despite strong pressure from
Britain and Malaysia.
   More are volunteering, and until recently this eased the
pressure for forced repatriation.
   Since March 1989, more than 3,000 have freely returned from Hong
Kong, mostly to northern Haiphong and Quang Ninh provinces. They
bear news of harsh camp conditions and the West's ``compassion
fatigue.''
   ``They go back to their home villages, tell their relatives and
neighbors and very quickly the message spreads,'' said Jacques
Mouchet, representative of the U.N. High Commissioner For Refugees
in Hanoi.
   Increasingly, Western nations say the exodus will never end
unless they alleviate Vietnam's economic problems.
   France and Italy resumed aid the past year, breaking the
U.S.-led aid embargo imposed after Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late
1978. Through private groups, Britain recently funded development
of areas from which people have fled.

<TEXT>
   President Bush's proposal to forgive billions
of dollars in debt owed by Latin American countries is being hailed
as a long-overdue initiative that will help struggling democracies
and boost U.S. standing in the world.
   The president laid out a package of proposals Wednesday to
forgive part of the $12 billion owed to the U.S. government by
Latin American and Caribbean countries. Bush said some of the debt
could be swapped to buy environmentally endangered land.
   In addition, he called for work to begin on a ``hemisphere-wide
free trade zone'' and said the United States would work with other
developed countries to channel up to $300 million annually to Latin
America to spur foreign investment.
   The proposals represented an about-face for the administration.
It had been resisting congressional calls for debt forgiveness on
the ground it could open the floodgates for domestic demands from
groups ranging from farmers to people with old student loans.
   The administration predicted that the Latin American debt
concessions would have little trouble winning congressional
approval. The initial reaction both at home and abroad was
favorable.
   Brazilian President Fernando Collor de Mello told Bush in a
phone call that his proposal was ``comprehensive, bold and
innovative,'' a Brazilian spokesman said.
   Honduran President Rafael Callejas termed Bush's proposals
``encouraging news,'' while a spokesman said Mexican President
Carlos Salinas de Gortari viewed Bush's speech as a ``very
important redefinition of the U.S. position regarding economic
development in Latin America.''
   John Reed, head of Citicorp, a large U.S. bank with about $8
billion in loans in Latin America, said he welcomed the initiative
as a way to bring economic growth and prosperity back to Latin
America.
   ``The president acknowledged that in this changed world the
United States cannot forget Latin America,'' said Reed.
   He said the proposal would meet some objections by commercial
banks to the administration's Third World debt plan outlined last
year by Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady.
   Brady's plan did not address debt owed to the United States and
other governments, but rather offered incentives for commercial
banks to write off a portion of their $1.3 trillion in Third World
debt. Commercial banks had argued that they were being forced to
shoulder the entire burden.
   C. Fred Bergsten, head of the Institute for International
Economics, a Washington-based research organization, said the
administration was recognizing that bolder foreign economic
initiatives were needed for America to retain its leadership role
in a post-Cold War world.
   ``The United States really had been a laggard in debt
forgiveness to other countries,'' Bergsten said. ``A realization
may be setting in that the United States may be shut out in world
leadership unless it takes a more forthright stance.''
   Brady told reporters that the new initiative for Latin America
could set a precedent for countries in other parts of the world,
particularly Poland. That nation has been pressing Western
countries to forgive part of its $39 billion foreign debt, most of
it owed to governments, to bolster Poland's struggling economic
reforms.
   An administration official, briefing reporters on condition of
anonymity, said the issue of Polish debt was certain to be
discussed at the July 9-11 economic summit in Houston.
   Officials explained that the debt forgiveness proposal would
focus primarily on $7 billion of loans made at favorable rates,
primarily to finance purchases of U.S. farm products. The amount of
debt forgiveness will be contingent on a country's willingness to
institute economic reform programs under the supervision of the
International Monetary Fund.
   The administration said part of the remaining $5 billion in
loans owed to agencies such as the U.S. Export-Import Bank could be
used for debt-for-nature swaps to encourage Third World nations to
protect natural resources.
   Officials said smaller and medium-sized countries such as
Honduras, El Salvador and Jamaica stood to benefit the most from
the debt forgiveness plan because a higher percentage of their
foreign debt was owed to the U.S. government.
   Bush proposed a U.S. contribution of $100 million annually to be
matched by similar $100 million in donations from European nations
and Japan into an investment fund to provide incentives for Latin
nations to attract foreign investment.
   The president said upcoming negotiations with Mexico over
removing all trade barriers between the two nations could set a
precedent for establishing a free-trade zone stretching from ``the
port of Anchorage to the Tierra del Fuego'' at the southern tip of
South America.
   The United States already has a free trade agreement with Canada.

<HEAD>NRC Says Some Low-Level Waste Can be Handled as Ordinary Trash</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission says about
one-third of the nation's low-level nuclear waste is ``below
regulatory concern,'' thereby paving the way for industry to
dispose of it as normal trash.
   The new policy, announced Wednesday, could end the special
handling requirements for any radioactive products or wastes that
expose people to no more than about 3 percent of the radiation they
absorb naturally.
   Consumer groups condemned the policy change. Joan Claybrook,
president of Public Citizen, demanded the removal of all five
members of the NRC, charging they had elected ``to trade off
people's lives in favor of the financial interests of the nuclear
industry.''
   ``Nothing could be further from the truth,'' NRC Chairman
Kenneth M. Carr declared at a news briefing at the commission's
headquarters in nearby Rockville, Md. ``None of this is going to
affect public health and safety.''
   Instead, Carr insisted, the new federal policy placing the
wastes ``below regulatory concern'' will allow federal and state
regulators ``to spend our resources on threats that are more
important. We think that in the long run, we're going to save more
lives.''
   Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., chairman of the House Interior
subcommittee on energy, wasn't so sure.
   ``I'm disturbed at the prospect of permitting the disposal of
certain low-level radioactive wastes from nuclear power plants in
thousands of landfills across the country,'' he said. ``It is
imperative that Congress closely scrutinize this new policy.''
   Miller scheduled a hearing on the issue for July 26.
   Carr stressed that the policy decision does not free industry
from current disposal requirements. The NRC plans to air the issue
at a nationwide series of public hearings.
   Barring a reversal, industries then would have to prove on a
case-by-case basis that particular radioactive wastes fall within
the guidelines for regulatory exemption.
   The policy would apply to radioactive wastes involving the final
stages of cleanup of decommissioned nuclear plants, consumer
products involving small amounts of radioactive materials and a
variety of radioactive wastes generated by hospitals and research
institutions.
   Aside from making disposal of such materials easier and cheaper,
it would open the way for some items to be recycled as consumer
products.
   Jonathan Becker, who has traced the issue for Public Citizen,
said the policy change could mean that as much as one-third of the
low-level radioactive materials now sent to special burial sites
could be dumped into community landfills, incinerators or sewer
systems.
   That could save the nuclear power industry, hospitals and
laboratories $82 million a year, he said.
   Pennsylvania, Illinois, New York, North Carolina, Alabama, South
Carolina and California now generate the largest amounts of
low-level radioactive waste each year.
   Becker said the NRC's own risk assumptions indicated the new
policy could lead to an additional 2,500 cancer deaths annually.
   Moreover, he contended, the decision flies in the face of recent
reports by the National Research Council and the Environmental
Protection Agency that the cancer risk from radiation may be much
higher than previously known.
   In the Northeast, several nuclear utilities have pledged to
continue to dispose of all radioactive wastes as currently
prescribed, no matter what the NRC does, to avoid exacerbating
public alarm about their operations.
   Under recent federal law, the states must trim their reliance on
dumps in Nevada, South Carolina and Washington state and build
their own disposal sites, either on a statewide or regional basis.
Their plans are due by 1993, but several already face strong local
protests from citizens who don't want nuclear dumps in their
backyards.
   The NRC says localized nuclear materials _ such as those in a
dump site _ that subject individuals to radiation doses of less
than 10 millirem per year would qualify for the regulatory
exemption.
   A stiffer standard, 1 millirem per year, would apply to recycled
products or consumer goods that are broadly distributed, such as
smoke detectors or wristwatches with luminescent dials.
   By comparison, the NRC says, Americans receive 300 millirem or
more per year in the normal course of their lives.
   This includes an average 200 millirem from the air they breathe,
30 millirem from cosmic radiation, 40 millirem from their food and
drink and 30 millirem from soils and building materials. A normal
chest X-ray yields about 20 millirem.

   A bad check charge against the fourth wife
of Washington Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke has been dropped after
she allegedly cooperated in several cases involving major drug
dealers.
   Commonwealth's Attorney Robert F. Horan Jr. said Assistant U.S.
Attorney Liam O'Grady asked him to be lenient with Marlene L.
Ramallo Chalmers. Horan dropped the grand larceny charges pending
against her.
   ``They (federal officials) were interested in us giving her a
break because she testified and provided information in a number of
major drug cases,'' Horan said. ``Restitution had been made and we
agreed to drop the charges. Anytime someone will give you a major
drug distributor, that's important.''
   In 1986, Chalmers, 37, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to import
less than a kilogram of cocaine, according to court records.
Chalmers married Cooke, 77, on May 5 at his Middleburg estate.
   She could not be reached for comment.
   Chalmers was arrested April 7, 1988, on a felony charge of
writing four bad checks to the Cosmetic Center. The checks totalled
$285.78. In Virginia, any bad check over $200 is a felony.
   According to court records, Chalmers, a native of Bolivia,
became involved in a drug smuggling scheme that involved couriers
transporting cocaine from La Paz, Bolivia to Rio de Janeiro to the
United States.
   Chalmers allegedly provided a cover by buying tickets and
providing expense money for couriers.
   In the 1986 case, she was charged with conspiracy to import
cocaine, importing cocaine and distribution and possession with
intent to distribute cocaine and travel in foreign commerce from
National Airport in aid of racketeering, according to court
records. Those charges were dismissed.

<HEAD>Focusing Flaw Cripples $1.5 Billion Telescope; Human Error
Possible</HEAD>

   The Hubble Space Telescope is crippled by a
focusing flaw that may have been caused by an undetected
``prescription'' error during the manufacture of polished mirrors
aboard the $1.5 billion craft.
   NASA's announcement of the problem Wednesday sent a shudder of
disappointment through an astronomy community that has waited years
for what were expected to be unprecedented views of the universe
from the orbiting telescope.
   The space agency said the focusing problem in the Hubble mirrors
cannot be fixed from the ground and at least two of the five
instruments aboard the spacecraft will be virtually useless until a
repair mission is flown by the space shuttle.
   Plans call for such a mission in 1993, but the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration said it hopes to make the
flight sooner.
   An official of the Danbury, Conn., company that made the mirrors
said the flaw may have been caused by a human error in testing of
the primary and secondary Hubble telescope mirrors as they were
being ground and polished.
   ``It appears that one of the elements may have been manufactured
to a prescription that wouldn't give you the desired result,'' said
Jack Rehnberg, chief of the space science office at the Hughes
Danbury Optical Co. ``It could have been a human error.''
   Rehnberg said the problem could be either in the primary or
secondary mirror or the manner that the two work together.
   A NASA investigation, led by Lew Allen of the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., is expected to start this week.
   Hubble was placed in a 381-mile orbit on April 25 amid dazzling
promises by NASA that the telescope could revolutionize the human
concept of the universe.
   The telescope, circling the Earth far above the obscuring
effects of the atmosphere, was expected to be able to see objects
such stars and galaxies that are 25 times fainter than those seen
by telescopes on the ground.
   For the first time, Hubble would permit humans to look up to 14
billion light years into space _ some 84 billion trillion miles.
This could give a glimpse of objects as they were just a few
billion years after the ``big bang'' that is thought to have
started the universe.
   Instead, said NASA scientist Ed Weiler, images captured by the
flawed Hubble now will be little better than what can be done by
telescopes on Earth.
   ``It is very disappointing, extremely disappointing,'' said Kim
Leschly of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   ``Many people were hoping to see new views of the universe. Now
we'll have to wait. That's very, very disappointing,'' said David
Koo, an astronomer at the University of California, Santa Cruz.
   Hubble deputy project manager Jean Olivier said the misfocusing
mirrors were discovered this week when engineers attempted to
fine-tune the path of light between the primary and secondary
mirrors.
   He said they discovered ``there was no single one point ... with
a crisp, clean image.''
   Additional testing showed that the problem was in the
manufacture of the mirrors and that there was nothing that could be
done from the ground to correct the flaw.
   Blaming the mirrors came as a surprise because NASA had touted
Hubble's 94-inch primary mirror as the smoothest large mirror ever
made.
   But somehow, a mistake was made, said Rehnberg of Hughes Danbury
Optical.
   ``We could have erred in the assembly of some of the test
equipment and it didn't get picked up even though we've had lots of
reviews, and checks and rechecks,'' he said.
   Weiler said the focusing problems means that a faint object
camera, designed to detect objects not otherwise visible, will see
no better than instruments on the ground. And a wide field camera
will be virtually useless, he said.
   ``There is no real science we can do with it at this time,'' he
said.
   Three instruments that study stars in ultraviolet and infrared
radiation will not be as seriously affected, although a high-speed
photometer will be able to do ``about half the science'' scheduled,
Weiler said.
   Hubble has had problems from early in the program. It was
originally scheduled for launch in 1986, but was delayed for four
years when the shuttle fleet was grounded following the Challenger
accident.
   After the telescope was deployed in orbit on April 25, engineers
learned that a cable was blocking rotation of an antenna. The
problem was corrected by limiting the antenna movement. Then
engineers learned that a computer program was pointing the
telescope at the wrong points in the sky. Computer software was
changed.
   The flawed mirrors on Hubble cannot be taken out and replaced by
the shuttle, but Weiler said replacement instruments could
compensate for the misfocused mirrors with special optics.
   ``We are pretty optimistic that we can take out all of the
aberration,'' said Weiler.
   Olivier said the Hubble mirrors were tested individually on the
ground but never as a combination because that would have cost
``hundreds of millions of dollars.''
   Hughes Danbury Optical, then a division of Perkin-Elmer, built
the Hubble telescope assembly under a $450 million contract that
included performance incentives.

<HEAD>Political Opponents Arrested, Tortured, and Executed In Sudan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Hundreds of opponents of Sudan's military
government have been arrested, more than 60 tortured and many
others executed since a coup one year ago, Amnesty International
said today.
   The Khartoum government claims all political prisoners have been
freed. But London-based human rights organization said it has
details of more than 200 prisoners of conscience still in detention
without charge or trial.
   Those arrested include political leaders, trade unionists,
academics, lawyers and prominent human rights activists, Amnesty
said in a statement.
   It called on the Sudanese government of Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan
el-Bashir to release all political prisoners and take steps to
prevent the torture of all inmates.
   El-Bashir seized power last June 30 after ousting a civilian
government in the North African nation.
   He crushed a coup attempt in April by what he called leftists
trying to replace his Moslem government with secular civilian rule
and make peace with southern rebels, who are mainly Christian and
animist.
   Since a state of emergency was declared after the coup, Amnesty
said, hundreds of political opponents have been detained and many
others executed or killed by government troops or militia.
   The government itself has said it executed 28 active or retired
army officers in connection with the April coup attempt.
   Amnesty said that in the past six months more than 60 prisoners
have been tortured in ``safe houses'' and secret interrogation
centers in Khartoum by a new security force known as The Security
of the Revolution which was formed after the coup.
   One prisoner is reported to have died recently from torture at
one of these centers where prisoners are secretly held for up to
several weeks before being taken to prison, Amnesty said.
   At the beginning of the year, it said, the government released
90 political prisoners and claimed that all prisoners had been
freed.
   But Amnesty said more than 200 were still detained, including 70
being held ``in grossly inadequate conditions'' at the isolated
Shalla prison in Sudan's western Darfur province, 500 miles from
their families in Khartoum.
   Some sick prisoners are not receiving medical treatment and
inmates have reported poor meals, filthy water and a complete lack
of sanitary facilities, the statement said.
   Under the military government, Amnesty said, the scope of the
death penalty has been broadened to include possessing foreign
currency and organizing strikes. Prisoners sentenced to death since
the coup have not been allowed to appeal their conviction and were
denied full legal representation at their trials, it said.
   In southern Sudan, illegal killings by government forces and
armed civilian militias have continued since the coup, Amnesty said.
   The human rights group said more than 100 civilian
non-combatants were deliberately killed by pro-government militia
in areas of armed conflict in October and November. And it said 42
southerners disappeared in custody after their arrest in Khartoum
in late October.
   More than 200 suspected government opponents were arrested in
the town of Juba in February, with many still in detention without
charge or trial, it said.

   Bidding for the slip actress Kathleen Turner
wears in Broadway's ``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof'' escalated quickly
after an auctioneer informed potential buyers she was wearing it
just a few blocks away.
   ``She's sweating in it right now,'' Diddi Lynn Worsole Worsole
said at the auction for Easter Seals on Tuesday. ``Maybe there will
be a little perfume on it.''
   Bidding had started at $500 and went up in increments of $100.
Real estate broker Henry Setaro came in with the top bid of $1,200.
   ``It's the closest I will ever get to Kathleen Turner,'' said
Setaro. ``I hope they don't wash it before I get it.''
   Setaro's wife sat next to him during the bidding. Sandy Setaro
said she approved of the purchase because the money was for a good
cause.
   Turner plays Maggie in a low-cut, lavender, thigh-length, silk
slip with lace trim.
   The slip actually is one of two that were custom-made for Turner
to wear in the Tennessee Williams play, in accordance with a union
regulation that requires two sets of each costume.

   A radio station will no longer play the music
of Grammy winner k.d. lang because the Canadian country star
appears in a new ad campaign called ``Meat Stinks.''
   KRVN in Lexington will boycott lang until she renounces the
group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals and her ``fanatic
anti-meat philosophy,'' program director Charlie Brogan said.
   KRVN, which broadcasts country music, farm and market reports to
Nebraska, Kansas and Iowa, was formed by farm groups in the late
1940s, Brogan said Wednesday.
   ``This is more than supporting the local economy. It's part of
our mission of ag service,'' Brogan said. ``Her music has given her
a platform. ... We decided by not playing her music, we're not
enhancing that platform.''
   The singer appears in the ad with a cow and says, ``If you knew
how meat was made, you'd probably lose your lunch. I know _ I'm
from cattle country. That's why I became a vegetarian. Meat stinks,
and not just for animals but for human health and environment.''
   Dan Mathews, PETA director of special projects, said the TV ads
and a print ad campaign will begin this summer.
   ``We were thrilled to have k.d. lang with her cattle country
background,'' Mathews said. ``Animals have no voice and k.d. has
such a beautiful voice.''

   A broker has stepped up efforts to sell Monkey
Business, the yacht that scuttled Gary Hart's 1988 presidential bid.
   The 83-foot charter boat's owner first cast about for buyers
last fall, and its captain, Butch Vogelsgang, said the asking price
was $1.5 million. In ads in newspapers around the nation this week,
the price was down to $1.225 million.
   For that the buyer will get a three-deck pleasure craft with a
Jacuzzi, three rosewood-paneled staterooms _ and a bit of history.
   Hart, the former senator from Colorado, fell from Democratic
presidential front-runner to infamy in less than a week after his
charter trip from Florida to Bimini with model Donna Rice came to
light in 1987.
   Hart and Rice denied any hanky-panky; Rice's friend Lynn Armandt
told the news media otherwise _ and collected a hefty fee.
   Yacht broker Bob Offer of Fort Lauderdale is selling the boat
for developer Donald Soffer.
   ``The boat has a character of its own,'' said Offer. ``When you
walk on board, you really want to have a good time.''
   Offer said Soffer, who had the Monkey Business custom-built in
1979, decided to market the boat in earnest because construction on
a new 140-foot yacht is almost complete.

<HEAD>Pacific Rim Playing Bigger Role in Farm Exports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exports come to mind quickly at the
Agriculture Department when the livelihood of American farmers is
discussed. And Pacific Rim countries are not far behind.
   What happens in the rim, notably Japan and other East Asian
countries, bears heavily on U.S. agricultural exports and,
consequently, the financial well-being of producers.
   Collectively, commodity exports to the major Pacific Rim
countries are increasing again this year, but the growth is smaller
than in 1989, a report by the department's Economic Research
Service said Wednesday.
   Exports to Japan, South Korea and Taiwan are expected to
increase but will not match the 10 percent gain of 1989 or the 28
percent jump in 1988, the report said.
   Agricultural sales to Canada are expected to rise sharply in the
fiscal year that began last Oct. 1 because of a change in the
reporting system, the agency said. Sales to Australia and New
Zealand probably will increase, it said.
   ``Economic growth in the developed Pacific Rim slowed for the
second straight year in 1989,'' the report said. ``Rising interest
and inflation rates, and labor shortages in East Asia are straining
the region's economies.''
   One factor was a strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the
Japanese yen, which possibly dampened demand for American farm
products, the report said. Meanwhile, the dollar fell against the
currencies of South Korea, Taiwan and Canada, which helped boost
export prospects.
   Domestic policies, production and competitive exports are
factors that draw attention from U.S. analysts.
   ``All developed Pacific Rim countries except New Zealand
increased their agricultural output in 1989-90,'' the report said.
``Gross farm income was higher in all countries. Government support
to agriculture was generally lower in 1988-89 and is estimated to
fall further for most countries in 1989-90.''
   Consumer eating habits remain diverse in the developed rim
countries, the report said. But diets in the Asian countries ``are
approaching those in Western countries as consumption of animal
protein grows and starch consumption falls.''
   Australia, a traditional supplier of grass-fed beef, is moving
to supply grain-fattened beef to Japan. That means more competition
for American producers.
   ``Current Australian feedlot capacity of about 600,000 head is
expected to double by 1992,'' the report said. ``Much of the recent
feedlot expansion has been with Japanese investment.''
   Further, the report said, ``Australia has the cattle, feed
grains and technology to be a significant U.S. competitor in
high-quality, grain-fed beef to Japan and other Asian markets,
although problems remain with infrastructure and stable feed
supplies.''
   New Zealand and Australia also have undertaken policy reforms
that are aimed in part at making their farm products more
competitive in world markets.
   ``Since 1984, New Zealand's farm sector has undergone a painful
adjustment resulting from removal of direct farm support, rising
interest rates and an appreciating exchange rate between 1985 and
1988,'' the report said. ``The policy reforms in the two countries
have lowered government assistance to agriculture.''

   Genetically altered potatoes that could be
naturally deadly to beetles are being field-tested in the Pacific
Northwest by a team led by Agriculture Department scientists.
   The outdoor tests were scheduled to begin this week in Prosser,
Wash., geneticist Charles R. Brown of the department's Agricultural
Research Service said Wednesday.
   ``Ultimately, we want to know whether potato plants could use
this genetic weapon to combat Colorado potato beetles with little
or no chemical insecticide,'' he said in a report issued here.
   Brown is based at the agency's vegetable and crop research unit
in Prosser and is collaborating with other scientists from the
University of Washington, Seattle, and another USDA researcher in
Yakima, Wash.
   The quarter-acre potato plots are at Washington State
University's research and extension center in Prosser.
   Brown said the added gene is from a strain of bacterium,
Bacillus thuringiensis, or Bt, that lives in soil naturally and
makes a beetle-killing protein.
   The Prosser tests were said to be the first in the United States
involving Bt genes placed in potatoes. Other researchers at private
companies and universities, however, have raised tomato, cotton and
tobacco plants that use a Bt gene and show pest resistance.
   Brown said the Colorado potato beetle is ``probably the worst
potato insect pest worldwide'' and that it has become resistant to
many pesticides.

   The Agriculture Department says China has
bought an additional 139,400 metric tons of U.S. wheat under a
price subsidy program.
   F. Paul Dickerson, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said Wednesday that six private
exporting companies made the deals under the department's Export
Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   Delivery of the wheat is scheduled for October, he said.
   The sales were part of 2 million tons authorized for China under
EEP on May 2. Previous allocations had been exhausted except for
5,050 tons. Dickerson said China has slightly more than 1 million
tons remaining in its current allocation.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat.
   Under EEP arrangements, private exporters can sell U.S.
commodities at reduced prices to meet foreign competition in
selected overseas markets and then collect free government
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies.
   Dickerson said the latest subsidies averaged $19.82 per ton, or
about 54 cents per bushel.
   The subsidized sales were handled by Continental Grain Co.,
74,400 bushels; Central States Enterprises Inc., 35,000; and
Mitsubishi International Corp., 30,000.

   Astronomers had hoped the $1.5 billion Hubble
Space Telescope would give their field its biggest boost since
Galileo first used a telescope in 1609. Now the trouble-plagued
observatory may make them wait a few more years.
   ``We've been waiting for a decade, so to wait some more is
pretty disappointing. I guess we'll have to suffer,'' said
astronomer David Koo of the University of California at Santa Cruz.
   NASA announced Wednesday that an apparent manufacturing error
prevents proper focusing of the mirrors on the telescope, which is
the most expensive unmanned spacecraft ever built.
   Agency officials said that until shuttle astronauts can make
repairs during a mission scheduled for 1993, the problem will make
the telescope's most important instrument _ the wide-field and
planetary camera _ virtually useless. NASA said it hopes to send a
shuttle earlier.
   The flaw also will make the telescope's second camera, the faint
object camera, unable to take pictures any better than those made
by a telescope on the ground. The Hubble was designed to study
extremely distant stars and galaxies.
   Three other instruments, which detect various types of light but
are not cameras, will be less seriously impaired.
   ``It's a major blow to our hopes,'' said Kim Leschly, wide-field
camera systems engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ``It
is very disappointing, extremely disappointing.''
   If the telescope's mirrors worked properly, the wide-field
camera would be able to make out an object the size of a baseball
from a distance of 200 miles.
   The camera was designed to help determine the age of the
universe, test theories of how the universe evolved, search for
possible planets orbiting nearby stars and map the surfaces of
moons, asteroids and comets.
   ``There still will be images from the current camera that will
be reasonably exciting, but they won't push the frontier,'' Leschly
said.
   Approved by Congress in 1977, the launch of the Hubble was
delayed not only by the 1986 Challenger explosion that grounded the
shuttle fleet but by numerous technical problems. It finally was
launched from shuttle Discovery in April.
   Scientists had ranked it with Galileo's first use of a telescope
in importance.
   Leschly said Jet Propulsion Laboratory employees reacted to the
latest problem by asking, ``How come people making the mirror
didn't do their job right?''
   ``As part of the Hubble team, you feel disappointed somebody
didn't do it right,'' Leschly said, ``and that hurts.''
   The mirrors and their supports were manufactured by Perkin-Elmer
Corp., now Hughes Danbury Optical Corp., of Danbury, Conn. Company
official Jack Rehnberg acknowledged human error may have been to
blame.
   ``People aren't crying. It's just that there have been so many
delays in this project that when you say wait another three years,
it's slightly depressing,'' said John Holtzman, an astronomer with
Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Ariz.

<HEAD>Soybean Farmers Oppose Drug-War Plan to Promote Crop Substitution</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Soybean farmers say they support the war on
drugs, but they don't want the United States to encourage Bolivian
coca farmers to grow soybeans instead of the leaf used to make
cocaine.
   But a House Agriculture subcommittee chairman says the war
against cocaine must not take a back seat to the interests of U.S.
soybean farmers.
   ``As long as drugs remain the scourge they are to this country,
they must be of highest priority, especially when the threat of
competition to U.S. farm interests is minimal, as appears to be the
case in this instance,'' Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kans., said at a
hearing Wednesday of his subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feed
grains.
   ``Soybean farmers want to help in the drug problem. But it's not
a good use of taxpayer dollars to subsidize competition if it
doesn't reduce drug production,'' James Lee Adams, chairman of the
American Soybean Association, said.
   He said his group did not lobby the Agriculture Department to
block use of federal funds for a U.S. Agency for International
Development program in Bolivia that was promoting soybean farming
as an alternative to coca.
   But Allan Mendelowitz, of the General Accounting Office, told
the subcommittee that an investigation of the situation revealed
``there is frequent, ongoing contact between the American Soybean
Association and the Agriculture Department.''
   Bolivia is second to Peru in coca leaf production. After
processing in Colombia, most of the Bolivian leaf is sold as
cocaine to drug users in the United States.
   President Bush signed an agreement Feb. 15 at the drug summit in
Cartagena, Colombia, with the presidents of Bolivia, Colombia and
Peru to encourage crop substitution and ``non-traditional exports''
as an alternative to the coca trade.
   ``I don't think there is a greater priority today than the war
on drugs,'' added Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla. ``I'm dumbfounded by
the response we got from the American Soybean Association. The
Department of Agriculture should be severely chastised for any role
they had.''
   Christopher Goldthwait, of the Agriculture Department, said the
federal program _ known as PL 480 or Food for Peace _ paying for
the Bolivian soybean project restricts aid to commodities that do
not compete with products grown in the United States.
   ``We remain concerned that project funds would contribute to
expanding Bolivian soybean production for export which, in turn
could adversely affect U.S. producers at a time when they were
already losing markets,'' he said.
   Mendelowitz said soybeans offer one of the best alternatives to
coca for Bolivia on the export market, though not enough soybeans
are produced to be a real threat to American growers.
   In 1989, Bolivia exported about 44,000 tons of soybeans, while
U.S. producers exported 17 million tons, Mendelowitz said.
   Frederick Schieck, of the Agency for International Development,
said U.S. officials didn't start out to encourage Bolivians to grow
soybeans.
   He said the original goal was increased wheat production, but
because the growing season is long enough for two crops, farmers
rotated into soybeans after the wheat harvest.
   He said Bolivia has a long way to go before any crop will
replace the $300 million a year in foreign exchange earnings
experienced from coca exports.
   Bolivia produces an estimated one-third of the world supply of
coca leaf and is the most coca-dependent of the Andean countries,
he said. About 250,000 Bolivians work in coca production.

<HEAD>Court Sets Guidelines to Shield Children in Abuse Testimony</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court's decision to let states
shield children from trauma when they testify in abuse cases is a
``victory for children,'' according to a youth welfare group.
   Many states already have adopted measures to protect young
witnesses in this growing area of criminal law and now may
determine whether their procedures meet the new guidelines set by
the court.
   Most states permit the use of videotaped testimony of sexually
abused children or allow one-way, closed-circuit televised
testimony. Some have a two-way system in which the child witness
can see the courtroom and the defendant on a monitor while the
judge and jury view the child.
   The high court said Wednesday such measures may be
constitutional _ depending on what safeguards are built in for
defendants. The court, in a pair of 5-4 rulings, said people
charged with child abuse have no guaranteed right to confront their
young accusers face to face.
   The ruling highlighted a hectic conclusion to the court's
1989-90 term, leaving what are expected to be only some routine
housecleaning chores. The justices did not plan to be on the bench
today when announcements are made in those matters.
   In other action Wednesday, the court:
   _Upheld federal policies that favor minorities in awarding
broadcast licenses, a major victory for affirmative action. By a
5-4 vote in cases from Florida and Connecticut, the justices said
preferential Federal Communications Commission policies aimed at
providing diversity over the nation's airwaves do not discriminate
unlawfully against whites.
   _Limited the power of environmentalists to sue in federal court
to prevent opening of federal lands to commercial development.
   _Upheld Arizona's death penalty law in a decision that also
removes a constitutional cloud from similar laws in Idaho and
Montana.
   _Ruled in a Maryland case that most of the nation's post offices
may ban all soliciting on their property.
   The court examined the child abuse issue in cases from Maryland
and Idaho and generally heartened advocates of children's rights.
   ``A state's interest in the physical and psychological
well-being of child abuse victims may be sufficiently important to
outweigh, at least in some cases, a defendant's right to face his
or her accusers in court,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for
the court.
   The number of cases is growing. More than 2.2 million child
abuse reports were filed in 1988, according to the National
Committee for the Prevention of Child Abuse.
   ``This is a victory for children,'' said Joyce Strom of the
Child Welfare League of America. ``This is a step in the right
direction of strengthening a judicial system to protect children
and acknowledge their special need.''
   The decisions were not a total victory for the states.
   Writing for the court in the Maryland case, O'Connor said states
may not simply disregard the right of defendants to confront their
accusers.
   States must show the elimination of the face-to-face
confrontation is necessary to protect children and that steps have
been taken to assure the testimony of the young witnesses is
reliable, she said.
   O'Connor said trial judges may shield children from such
confrontations only when there would be substantial emotional
trauma _ not if the youngsters merely are nervous or reluctant to
testify.
   The court upheld the child-molesting conviction of the owner of
a Clarksville, Md., day care center. Four young children were
allowed to testify via closed-circuit TV out of the defendant's
presence.
   By a separate 5-4 vote, the court refused to reinstate a Boise,
Idaho, woman's child abuse conviction thrown out by the state's
highest court because the child did not testify. A pediatrician
testified at the trial about his interview with the 2-year-old
alleged victim.

   Attackers apparently targeting
the president of El Salvador's assembly hit one of his police
escorts with gunfire on Wednesday but no one was injured, the
politician said.
   Assembly president Ricardo Alvarenga, who was on his way home
from the assembly, told a news conference that his car took off at
high speed when he heard the shooting.
   He blamed the attack on leftist rebelsm, who have been fighting
a series of U.S. backed governments for a decade.
   Alvarenga lamented the shooting incident because it occurred
just two days after rightist government of President Alfredo
Cristiani and guerrilla leaders completed a round of peace talks in
Mexico.
   His words at the news conference were broadcast on independent
Radio YSKL.
   Alvarenga, a member of Cristiani's governing Republican National
Alliance, said he heard two or three shots lodge in one of his
police escort's cars.
   He said one police cruiser had been in front of him and one in
back.
   The incident happened during a rainstorm that caused a power
outtage, leaving the streets dark.
   Alvarenga said the shots rang out when he was about 1.5 miles
from the assembly.

<HEAD>Sakharov's Widow: Gorbachev an Obstacle to Democratic Change</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet human rights activist Yelena Bonner says
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has become an ``obstacle to
democratic change,'' and that the Communist Party should step aside
and take the government with it.
   The 73-year-old wife of the late Soviet physicist and Nobel
Peace Prize winner Andrei D. Sakharov also accused Gorbachev and
the Communists of provoking ethnic conflicts and blocking economic
progress in the Soviet Union.
   ``At the beginning, when Gorbachev declared all these changes,
he made a very serious, non-trivial step. But during the last two
years he has not moved forward,'' Ms. Bonner said in an interview
Tuesday.
   She said Gorbachev's reforms since he came to power five years
ago have done little to improve the lot of the Soviet people.
   ``It turns out all the changes were made to guarantee him
personal power. He becomes an obstacle to democratic change,'' Ms.
Bonner told The Associated Press.
   Sakharov's widow was in Israel to dedicate a Jerusalem park in
the honor of her late husband and accept an honorary degree in his
name.
   Ms. Bonner married Sakharov in 1971 and lived with him in
internal exile in the Volga city of Gorky from January 1980 until
December 1986, when Gorbachev allowed Sakharov to return to Moscow.
   Ms. Bonner said she felt a strong democratic trend in the Soviet
Union among people who seek ``a smooth transition to democracy.''
   ``But the (Communist) party is blocking it and this provokes
conflict,'' she said.
   Ms. Bonner noted that Sakharov, who died Dec. 14, had pushed for
a multiparty system and demanded that state land be given to the
peasants by the spring of 1989.
   But instead of embracing the changes suggested by Sakharov that
``could feed us in just two years,'' the government introduced a
limited system of leasing some land from collective farms under
which ``people are not free.'' Attempts to revive industry have
also failed, Ms. Bonner said.
   She said the Communist Party has been slow to relinquish its
political monopoly despite promising to do so, and that the
leadership has maintained its old authoritarian ways in dealing
with restive Soviet republics.
   Ms. Bonner cited the bloody dispute over the majority Armenian
enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh in Soviet Azerbaijan. That dispute has
grown into almost a guerrilla war between the two republics.
   Instead of following a democratic decision by Karabakh leaders
who voted in favor of Armenian rule, she charged, Gorbachev
``adopted Stalinist constitution regarding the wholeness of
borders'' and thus ignited the conflict.
   ``Gorbachev would change the constitution in two hours to assure
an increase in power for himself. But when it came to people he
decided the constitution could not be changed and statehood
prevailed,'' she said.
   Earlier this year, Gorbachev pushed legislation through the
Congress of People's Deputies that expanded the power of the
presidency, to which he was then re-elected by deputies.
   Now, Soviet security forces are stationed in the capitals of the
rival republics. Ms. Bonner said she feared ``this stupidity of
military and political leadership'' could lead to worsened
inter-ethnic bloodletting.
   Ms. Bonner also blamed the Soviet authorities for equally
violent ethnic outbursts in Soviet Central Asia that she said
resulted from worsening economic and ecological conditions.
   ``We _ not me and not the Russians but the central
administration _ led Central Asia to complete devastation. We have
destroyed a piece of the planet with our own hands,'' Ms. Bonner
said.
   Her long list of criticisms of Gorbachev included his economic
blockade of Lithuania after the Baltic republic declared
independence on March 11. Since then, there have been moves by
several other Soviet republics to secede.
   ``Now other republics gradually declare themselves sovereign and
they all adopt laws saying their local laws prevail over the Soviet
ones,'' Ms. Bonner said. ``Gorbachev and the leadership have lost
their power, they must work out a new agreement with the republics
and they will have exactly the amount of power the republics are
ready to grant them.''
   In the future, Ms. Bonner said she saw the Soviet Union as a
coalition of free nations, perhaps with a mutual defense pact, that
are bound by economic agreements.
   ``I don't know what he (Gorbachev) wants,'' she said. ``All his
economic and political changes in the country are very ambivalent.''

<HEAD>Shoppers Mourn Coming Demise of `A Very Classy Store'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Huge ``Going Out of Business Sale'' banners
plastered across the display windows of Garfinckel's department
store obscured the mannequins in stylish black cocktail dresses and
upscale beachwear.
   Carole Melham was shocked. She's been shopping at Garfinckel's
since she was a little girl growing up in suburban Chevy Chase, Md.
   ``I just can't imagine they could let this happen,'' she said,
standing on the sidewalk in 80-degree heat waiting for the doors to
open Wednesday.
   ``It's symbolic of a lost era, like the Paris of the 1920s,''
she said. ``I was raised on Garfinckel's. Shopping was a major
event. My mother bought me tons and tons of things here. I remember
when there was a doorman to greet you.
   ``It was another world. I loved the atmosphere, the high
ceilings, the elevators, the sales clerks who'd look for good buys
and set things aside for you. Garfinckel's stayed old-fashioned,
and it never went down the tubes. It was a very classy store.
   ``All that's left are congested malls in the suburbs where
everyone chews gum. The merchandise has gotten so bad. The big
stores, it's like shopping in a zoo or a barn. It's so raunchy. The
world has changed. It's all very depressing.''
   Garfinckel's, an elegant Washington landmark for 85 years,
announced last week it was seeking protection from creditors in
federal bankruptcy court and closing seven of its nine stores,
including its flagship downtown emporium at the busy intersection
of 14th and F streets.
   Retail industry analysts said Garfinckel's had fallen victim to
aggressive competition from Bloomingdale's, Neiman-Marcus,
Nordstrom and other large national department stores that have
muscled into Washington's affluent suburbs in recent years.
   Garfinckel's troubles were compounded by a succession of five
owners whose conflicting marketing strategies confused and
disappointed their traditional customers, who included the rich and
powerful of Washington. Many of them took their business elsewhere.
   The liquidation sale is intended to clear Garfinckel's store
shelves and display cases of all merchandise, valued at $22
million, within 60 days. Under a court-approved deal, an estimated
$9 million to $10 million of the sale proceeds is expected to go
directly to one of Garfinckel's principal secured creditors.
   Mrs. Melham and her small son, Timothy, were among hundreds of
white-gloved matrons, their yuppie offspring and eager bargain
hunters who swarmed through Garfinckel's polished bronze doors at
noon Wednesday.
   They snapped up Garfinckel's trademark luxury items _ Waterford
crystal, Hermes scarves, Countess Mara silk ties, Godiva
chocolates, Givenchy pantyhose and Christofle silverware _ at a 20
percent discount.
   Within 15 minutes, the front doors were ordered closed
temporarily to contain the throng. A short time later, two of
Garfinckel's wood-paneled elevators jammed under the crush of
shoppers trying to get upstairs.
   ``I feel so very sad,'' said Gertrude Hallila, 72, who has been
a loyal customer since she arrived in Washington during World War
II. She remembers riding the trolley with her children for a day at
Garfinckel's, with lunch in the Greenbrier Room.
   Maria Kostecka, who lives in the posh suburb of Potomac, Md.,
said she was ``extremely upset'' over Garfinckel's demise.
   She liked the ``excellent clothes,'' the dignified atmosphere _
no shoving or pushing in the spacious aisles _ and the ``very
classy'' saleswomen.
   ``They would call my home and tell me about a forthcoming
sale,'' she recalled. ``They knew my size, and they'd say they were
holding a dress they thought I'd like. If I returned something two
months later, they would take it back with a smile. Little things
like that mean a lot.''
   Mildred Pickett remembers moving to racially segregated
Washington to work for the government in 1942. She was a young
black stenographer from Canton, Ill., and a stranger to
discrimination.
   ``Years ago, it was said Negroes couldn't come to
Garfinckel's,'' she recalled. ``But if you dressed well and carried
yourself well, they would accept some people, depending on the
clerk. I never felt uncomfortable coming to a store like
Garfinckel's. The quality was very good and all the clerks were
courteous and businesslike. Why, the blouse I'm wearing today I
bought on sale here 18 years ago.''

<TEXT>
   About 9 million Americans could get money to
pay expenses for college or vocational training each year if a
portion of the Social Security surplus is invested in a revolving
loan fund, a group of economists said today.
   The Economic Policy Institute released a proposal by University
of Massachusetts economist Barry Bluestone and colleagues to make
available to every American a lifetime ``line of credit'' of
$40,000 to finance the costs of college or university education or
vocational training or apprenticeship.
   Social Security surpluses, estimated by the Congressional Budget
Office to reach $73 billion by 1991, would be used to underwrite
the program. Costs would total about $40 billion per year but are
expected to rapidly decrease, as the surplus continues to grow.
   Borrowers could take up to 25 years to repay their loans by
means of a levy on future earnings. The Internal Revenue Service
would be charged with the collection duties, through payroll
deductions.
   ``The key domestic issues facing America in the 1990s will
center on questions of `equity' _ in both sense of the term,'' the
report said. ``Equity means `fairness,' but it also refers to
investment such as corporate stock that pays dividends based on the
profitability of an asset.''
   The proposal, called the Equity Investment in America program,
applies the dual meaning of equity ``to mitigate the financial
barriers to college and university schooling and vocational
training for all students,'' regardless of income, age or social
background.
   The report pointed to statistics that show the ratio of annual
earnings of college graduates to high school graduates has
increased from 1.5 to one in 1963 to more than 1.8 to one in 1987 _
an increase of 20 percent. A recent survey found that one-third of
the students who delayed or indefinitely put off college pointed to
the expense involved.
   The federal government has moved to disenfranchise middle-class
students from federal assistance by restricting eligibility for
grants, the report said.
   In 1979, the government set a $32,500 ceiling on family income
for a student to be eligible for grant support. Today, despite
inflation, a family must have an income no higher than $28,000 to
be eligible for aid.
   The largest federal loan programs, the Stafford Student Loan,
provides a maximum of $2,625 per academic year for the first two
years of undergraduate study and $4,000 for each subsequent year,
up to a five-year maximum of $17,250.
   Students over four years must add an average of $9,750 out of
pocket to attend a public university and at least $26,750 to go to
a private institution.
   The new program would assist about 9 million students each year
_ 7 million to 7.5 million in colleges and universities and 1.7
million in vocational training, the study said.
   Bluestone and co-authors Alan Clayton-Matthews and John Havens
of Boston College, and Howard Young of the University of Michigan
said their plan would create a new Education Department agency to
raise capital for the program, make the awards to students and
oversee repayment.
   Under the plan, loan repayment amounts deducted by the IRS would
remain low if a student's income after college is low, and increase
an income levels increase.
   ``Across all participants in the system, the combination of
increasing incomes, IRS collection of loan repayments and long
repayment schedules will result in full repayment to the Social
Security system,'' the authors said.

   Bowling long ago shed its Fred Flintstone image
and its wide appeal is no more apparent than at Marigold Bowl.
   There's a Japanese league, a Puerto Rican league, a janitors
league and a gay league. About every variety of race, religion,
occupation and ethnic background is represented at the 32-lane
alley near the Chicago Cubs' Wrigley Field.
   ``We're a league of nations. Our customers are diversified,''
said owner Bob Fagenholz, 54.
   There's even a league called the Marigold Straits.
   ``We had a gay league bowling in front of us and another after
us. We just wanted to define ourselves, but we spell it
differently,'' said Fred Schmidt, an architect.
   Everybody seems to get along.
   ``When the gays first started bowling here, it was hard for some
people to get used to _ like anything new. Now, they are used to
it,'' said Fagenholz's son, Fred, who is Marigold's manager.
   Mark Miller of the American Bowling Congress in Milwaukee said,
``We'd like to believe that bowling centers are melting pots, and
that those in the inner cities would have such mixed leagues.''
   The number of U.S. bowlers rose from 68 million in 1987 to 74
million last year, according to the ABC.

   The Bush administration's support for a
tenfold increase in child labor law fines is a welcome change from
the Reagan era's hands-off attitude, Democrats and union officials
say.
   ``Any imposition on businesses _ that just wasn't done. This
notion of increasing fines is a big improvement,'' AFL-CIO
spokesman Rudy Oswald said Wednesday of the endorsement by Labor
Secretary Elizabeth Dole.
   Mrs. Dole, in testimony prepared for the House labor standards
subcommittee today, backed legislation to increase from $1,000 to
$10,000 the maximum penalty for businesses that employ youngsters
in dangerous jobs or for too many hours.
   Mrs. Dole also supported stiffer criminal penalties so that
prosecutors could seek jail terms for first-time willful violators.
Currently, jail terms are only available upon the second conviction.
   The higher fines are in a bill by Reps. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.,
and Don Pease, D-Ohio.
   Mrs. Dole ``has talked about cracking down on this before, and
it was met with skepticism. One has got to take her seriously
now,'' Pease said Wednesday.
   Schumer's office called Dole's support a ``welcome change.''
   The current penalties have not been changed since they were
established in 1974.
   ``We seek a balance. Our goal is to impose penalties which are
strong enough to deter violations, but do not dissuade law-abiding
employers from offering productive work experiences for youth,''
Mrs. Dole's testimony said.
   Besides higher fines, Oswald called on the Labor Department to
increase the size of its enforcement staff to ensure that
businesses aren't exploiting children.
   Since March, federal labor agents have conducted two nationwide
sweeps of fast-food chains and other businesses, finding nearly
20,000 violations of child labor laws.
   Mrs. Dole said one reason child labor violations have increased
dramatically in recent years _ 128 percent since 1986 _ is the
nation's tight labor market. The workforce has been expending at an
annual rate of only 1 percent, its slowest rate in nearly 40 years.
   ``Faced with a shrinking pool of workers, some employers have
reacted by putting young people to work in unsafe conditions, or
for hours beyond the limits of the law,'' Mrs. Sole said.

   Nelson Mandela paid silent tribute Wednesday at
the tomb of Martin Luther King Jr., and the slain civil rights
leader's widow fervently upheld Mandela's right to depart from
non-violence in the struggle for black rights in South Africa.
   Mandela did not speak during the brief wreath-laying ceremony,
which included the singing of the anthem of the U.S. civil rights
movement, ``We Shall Overcome.''
   Later, the Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference that King founded, told Mandela:
``We reject the constant nagging you have experienced about
violence. ... We respect the right of oppressed people everywhere
to seek their own liberation.''
   The audience of more than 1,500 people at Big Bethel AME Church
cheered wildly.
   Coretta Scott King said, ``Reverend Lowery has spoken for all of
us and he spoke well. We support you; we love you; we revere you.''
   Mandela told the audience, ``As a result of your support and the
hospitality you have shown us now, it is futile for the white
minority in South Africa to resist the people's demand for
one-person, one-vote.''
   Mandela later addressed a sold-out rally at 46,000-seat Grant
Field, praising King as a ``giant among giants.'' He quoted King's
famous ``I Have a Dream'' speech, which ended with the declaration,
``Let freedom ring.''
   ``Let us all exclaim, `Let freedom ring in South Africa,''' he
said.
   The stadium crowd stood and cheered, chanted and waved their
fists for 1{ minutes when Mandela took the podium, where he brought
the Georgia audience greetings ``from the fighting people of South
Africa.''
   The rally capped the fourth stop on Mandela's U.S. tour, after
New York, Boston and Washington. He arrived in Miami on Wednesday
just before midnight.
   Mandela was greeted at the Alexander Hotel on Miami Beach by up
to 200 supporters. But the visibly tired Mandela was hustled to his
hotel room.
   The crowd chanted ``Free South Africa'' and then ``Free South
Florida'' and finally ``Where is Suarez?'' The last chant referred
to Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez, who denounced Mandela for his support
of Cuba's Fidel Castro.
   In Atlanta, Martin Luther King III told a reporter that
Mandela's visit to the center named for his father showed that,
``Clearly, he does not support violence. I think Mr. Mandela wants
non-violent solutions, but the government has pushed him to that.''
   Some local civil rights officials had suggested Mandela should
follow King's philosophy and renounce violence. But upon his
arrival here Wednesday morning, the founder of the African National
Congress wasted no time reminding the group of his view that black
South Africans face a different battle than the one King led.
   ``Unlike you, we are still under the grip of white supremacy,''
Mandela said at the airport. To reporters he added: ``Non-violence
is a good policy when conditions permit.''
   King was assassinated in 1968, five years after Mandela began
his 27-year prison stay for plotting sabotage to overthrow the
minority white government of South Africa. The government released
him in February and negotiations are underway aimed at dismantling
apartheid.
   A scheduled midday break for the 71-year-old Mandela was
extended, delaying the wreath-laying ceremony by about three hours.
Mandela has at times canceled events to rest during his grueling
14-nation tour of Europe and North America. A downpour soaked the
1,300 people waiting near King's crypt. A carnival atmosphere set
in when the rain stopped, complete with popcorn vendors and music
from a military band.
   Mandela was cheered by about 5,000 people along Auburn Avenue, a
historic stretch of black businesses and civil rights landmarks, as
he arrived at the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent
Social Change.
   After a brief meeting with Mrs. King and other dignitaries,
Mandela and his wife, Winnie, placed the wreath at the crypt, which
sits above a reflecting pool at the King Center.
   Mandela also received honorary doctorate degrees from 40
predominantly black colleges at a convocation at Morehouse College.
Later he was to appear at a sold-out rally at the 46,000-seat Grant
Field.
   Mrs. Mandela received a standing ovation from a gathering of
1,500 people, mostly women, at a $100-a-plate luncheon benefiting
the ANC.
   ``I cannot tell you how touched I am by this warmth, your
kindness and your identity with our struggle,'' she said. ``We come
from racist South Africa. ... You are reminding us what it is to
belong to a family of mankind.''
   At Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport, Gov. Joe Frank
Harris, a white conservative Democrat, called Mandela an
inspiration, and welcomed him to ``the birthplace of equality and
justice for all of America.''
   Mayor Maynard Jackson joined Mandela and his wife, Winnie, in
raising a clenched fist salute during the playing of the ANC's
anthem.
   Security considerations kept the crowd at the airport to 200
invited guests, including a group of children from a city-run
interracial camp and a marching band. Along a nearby road, about
100 people strained to see the South African leader.
   There was no sign of protest over Mandela's refusal to repudiate
Libyan President Moammar Gadhafi, Cuban leader Fidel Castro and
Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat.
   But in the Miami area, where Mandela was scheduled to address a
labor meeting Thursday, no official welcome was planned and
Cuban-American groups planned rallies to protest Mandela's support
of Castro.
   Suarez and four area Cuban-American mayors have accused Mandela
for insensitivity to human rights in Cuba, and Mayor Alex Daoud of
largely Jewish Miami Beach condemned him for ties to Gadhafi and
Arafat.
   Black leaders vowed to take it upon themselves to welcome
Mandela.
   ``He is our brother,'' said Johnnie McMillian, president of
Miami's NAACP chapter. ``If they say he's not welcome, they're
saying we're not welcome, too.''
   Mandela's address Thursday to the American Federation of State,
County and Municipal Employees in Miami Beach isn't open to the
public, so black leaders planned shows of support outside the hall
and in a Liberty City park, where the speech will be broadcast over
loudspeakers.
   Meantime, leaders of various Cuban-American and anti-Castro
groups met Tuesday night to plan a protest at the convention center.
   The Atlanta crowd carried only pro-Mandela signs. The John Birch
Society bought a newspaper ad Monday condemning Mandela as a
criminal, but Wednesday's crowd regarded him as a persecuted hero.
   ``He's been in jail for 27 years for trying to help Africa
become a better place. That's not right,'' said 10-year-old Audrey
Durden.
   ``I'm completely overwhelmed. This is very historical not only
for Africa but for the world,'' said Ayesha Naji, 40, of Atlanta, a
former resident of Liberia. ``He represents a worldwide hero for
me.''

   Timber workers figure a mock sign at a
local tavern best tells their future.
   ``Notice to Owl-Displaced Workers,'' the sign reads. Temporary
jobs will open soon, including: ``Hiking Trail Builder, Grades I &amp;
2; Hiking Boot Polisher; and Spotted Owl Nest Cleaner.''
   The government Tuesday announced preliminary plans to restrict
logging in the Northwest to protect the rare northern spotted owl.
At the same time, the government said it will try to balance the
industry's needs against the owl's.
   But Loggers at the Waterhole Tavern No. 1 were skeptical.
   They and others walking the main street of this one-mill town of
1,200 said that in the end, they're going to suffer.
   ``This industry has been in an uproar since the 1920s,'' growled
Jim Miller, a logger, miller and part-time bartender. ``This
spotted owl thing is just the latest setback for us.''
   Miller and others said the industry already is feeling the
effects of a weakened lumber products market as the nation's
housing starts decline.
   Substantial logging cutbacks in virgin, or old-growth, forest to
protect owls ``would affect us drastically,'' said Simpson Timber
mill manager Del Orren. The mill down the street from the tavern
employs 350 people making doors for homes. It relies exclusively on
old-growth timber, he said.
   ``We're feeling the pinch some,'' he said. ``Any logging
cutbacks are going to hurt.''
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said Friday the spotted owl,
of which 3,000 to 5,000 pairs remain, would be designated a
threatened species July 23. The move cheered environmentalists, who
are seeking to protect not only the owl but the remaining
centuries-old forests in Washington, Oregon and northern California.
   But the environmentalists want far more extensive restrictions
on logging to protect the shy, 2-foot-tall owl than were announced
Tuesday. A task force headed by Agriculture Secretary Clayton
Yeutter is to devise a detailed plan by Sept. 1.
   The preliminary plan will reduce logging on U.S. Bureau of Land
Management land in Oregon and Northern California at a cost of
1,000 jobs over the next two years, said Interior Secretary Manuel
Lujan. He said 450 owls would be saved.
   An earlier, more extensive proposal by government scientists
would have resulted in the loss of nearly 28,000 jobs on federal
land over 10 years.
   Yeutter and Lujan also called on Congress to relax the
Endangered Species Act so that policy makers will have more
latitude to consider the economic and social impact of protecting
wildlife.
   Jim Pissot, spokesman for the Audubon Society of Washington,
said environmentalists will sue to stop any timber sales that
threaten owl habitat.
   Timber workers were skeptical the government is looking out
after their interests.
   ``You want to know what I think?'' Alfred Dierich, a guard at a
logging site, said as he stood outside the town's main grocery
store. ``I think it's all just a bunch of politics.
   ``Ain't nobody going to help us, and it's going to be rough any
way you look at her,'' Dierich said.

   A House subcommittee chairman says he is
angered by President Bush's refusal to ``get off the fence'' and
find a way to save the northern spotted owl while still protecting
logging jobs in the Northwest.
   Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., contended Wednesday that a lack of
scientific credibility in the administration's preliminary plans to
protect the threatened owl will force a court battle that will
paralyze the region's logging industry unless Congress steps in.
   ``The president is leading us right down the road and into a
legal disaster,'' said Vento, chairman of the House Interior
subcommittee on national parks and public lands.
   ``The administration is putting us right back in court _ right
back into paralysis in that area,'' he said.
   The Fish and Wildlife Service last Friday declared the owl a
threatened species. It cited scientific evidence that current
forest management practices are inadequate to reverse the shrinking
habitat and declining population that jeopardize the owl's survival.
   An estimated 3,000 to 5,000 pairs of the owls are believed to
exist.
   Vento said he was most upset by Agriculture Secretary Clayton
Yeutter's decision Tuesday to postpone an announcement on a
solution to the problem and instead form a new timber task force
that will report to Bush by Sept. 1 on how many trees the Forest
Service should cut next year.
   ``The president ought to get off the fence instead of passing
the buck to another blue-ribbon committee. We've got enough blue
ribbons around here to go to the state fair,'' Vento said.
   ``We have got to have a reserved forest system. We have got to
take some land and preserve it.''
   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. said Tuesday that harvest
reductions on Bureau of Land Management lands will be much less
than was feared as a result of owl protection.
   Yeutter said he will chair the new task force that will strive
to maintain near-current harvest levels in the Pacific Northwest
forests inhabited by the 2-foot-tall owl.
   The announcements drew heated criticism from environmentalists,
who subscribe to the scientific report that suggests Northwestern
timber harvests must be cut nearly in half to ensure that the owl
will not become extinct.
   Lujan said the BLM will enact a plan on Oct. 1 that will reduce
BLM timber harvest levels in Oregon and northern California from
950 million board feet annually to 750 million board feet.
   BLM Director Cy Jamison said the plan will save more owls but
cause less economic disruption than would a plan offered in April
by a panel of government scientists chaired by Forest Service
biologist Jack Ward Thomas.
   Jamison's plan would cost 1,000 jobs over two years, compared
with the government's prediction that the Thomas report would
result in the loss of nearly 8,000 logging jobs on BLM lands by the
end of the decade.
   The Thomas plan also is projected to cost more than 20,000 jobs
on Forest Service lands by the year 2000.

   The case of a doctor charged with
murdering his wife and burying her in the basement of a house he
bought with his pregnant girlfriend has transfixed this Midwestern
community.
   The courthouse is filled each day, and a TV station has been
taping each day's proceedings and airing them later in their
entirety.
   ``Not many people get buried in the basement of a home your
family's going to live in. This is more like a movie, a murder
mystery,'' said Barbara Petit, a lifelong resident of this city of
50,000 midway between Columbus and Cleveland.
   Dr. John F. Boyle, a 47-year-old osteopath, is charged with
aggravated murder and abuse of a corpse in the slaying of his wife,
Noreen, 44. Police said Boyle suffocated her on New Year's Eve,
buried her in the basement floor of a house he and his girlfriend
had bought near Erie, Pa., and sealed the grave with concrete.
   Common Pleas Judge James Henson told jurors Wednesday that he
expected deliberations to begin today.
   Boyle could receive up to life in prison if convicted.
   In testimony this week, Boyle said that he planned to have his
11-year-old son and 3-year-old adopted daughter live with him in
the house, and that he promised his son he would search for his
missing mother.
   ``I told him I would try to find his mommy, and if there was any
talking to the police to be done, I would do it,'' Boyle said.
   Her body was dug up Jan. 25 during a police search of the house.
   During 9{ hours of testimony, Boyle denied allegations he killed
his wife so he could end costly divorce proceedings and move to
Pennsylvania with his lover, Sherri Campbell of Mansfield.
   He said his relationship with his wife had been poor since their
marriage in 1968. Mrs. Boyle knew of his affair with Ms. Campbell,
who on Jan. 12 gave birth to a child he fathered, Boyle said. Ms.
Campbell has since filed a paternity suit against Boyle, who has
been in jail since Jan. 25.
   He testified that his wife left him on the morning of Dec. 31.
He never reported her missing. She had left several times during
their marriage but returned each time, he said.
   In testimony last week, Boyle's son said that early on Dec. 31,
he heard his parents arguing, heard a scream and heard a thump
``like a body hitting a wall.''

<HEAD>Court Ruling Should Boost Minority Broadcast Ownership</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A surprise Supreme Court decision upholding
broadcast affirmative action rules should reinvigorate efforts to
increase minority ownership of U.S. radio and TV stations,
broadcasters say.
   Recent legal challenges to the Federal Communications Commission
rules had put a damper on attempts to expand minority broadcast
ownership, the broadcasters said following Wednesday's 5-4 ruling.
   James L. Winston, executive director of the National Association
of Black-Owned Broadcasters, said the court's decision ``means the
FCC's ability to help promote minority ownership can now go forward
without fear of constitutional challenge.''
   Winston said blacks own 182 radio stations and 17 television
stations, compared with 30 radio stations and one TV station in
1978 when the rules first were adopted. The FCC said blacks now own
3.5 percent of broadcast stations.
   ``While this still ... is not at the level we would like to see,
we are pleased that the ability of the FCC to utilize policies to
increase ownership will be allowed to continue and expand,''
Winston said.
   FCC Chairman Alfred Sikes said he was ``pleased that the cloud
of doubt that has surrounded the commission's implementation of
these policies has been dispelled.''
   Lois Wright, vice president of Inner City Broadcasting Corp. in
New York City, said the rules had been working effectively and ``I
think they'll work more effectively now.
   ``These (Supreme Court) decisions have a direct impact,'' she
added. ``Once you they're sustained, you're likely to get more
deals'' for would-be minority broadcasters.
   Wright said the FCC under Sikes appears to be a better friend to
the affirmative action rules than the FCC during the Reagan
administration.
   Andrew J. Schwartzman of the Media Access Project, a coalition
of groups that had urged the court to uphold the FCC policies, said
he was surprised by the decision. ``Scrape me off the floor. The
Supreme Court has opened the door of opportunity for America's
minorities,'' he said.
   The court's ruling covered two cases.
   In a case from Florida, the justices allowed the commission to
give special, favorable consideration to Hispanic minorities in
deciding who would win a license for an Orlando TV station.
   In the other case involving a Connecticut TV station, the court
upheld the commission's distress-sale policy, which lets a
broadcaster faced with the loss of his license sell to a
minority-owned business at 75 percent of the station's market
value. The ruling was a victory for a Hispanic-led company in
Hartford.
   Schwartzman said the ruling also lets the FCC continue its
policy of giving preferential treatment to women seeking broadcast
licenses.
   Although the court did not address the issue of women's rights,
FCC affirmative action policies treat women and minorities almost
identically.
   The ruling removes a threat to other federal affirmative action
programs, including those adopted by the transportation and defense
departments and by the Small Business Administration.
   In its most important previous ruling on preferential minority
treatment by the federal government, a more liberal high court in
1980 upheld a public works program that set aside a percentage of
federal funds for minority contracts.
   But more recently the court has cut back on affirmative action.
Last year the justices struck down a Richmond, Va., program that
set aside a percentage of local public works contracts for
minority-owned businesses. That ruling cast doubt on the validity
of numerous similar plans of states and cities but had no bearing
on federal programs.
   In Wednesday's ruling, Justice William J. Brennan wrote for the
court that congressional approval of racial preferences shields
such programs from the kind of challenge that could invalidate
similar state and city plans.
   ``It is of overriding significance in these cases that the FCC's
minority ownership programs have been specifically approved _
indeed mandated _ by Congress,'' he said.
   But Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said the decision undermines the
nation's fundamental commitment to equal treatment for all
Americans. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said the ruling conjures up
images of racial segregation.
   Also dissenting were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Antonin J. Scalia. Justices William Brennan, Thurgood Marshall,
Harry A. Blackmun, Byron R. White and John Paul Stevens were the
majority.

   The earthquake that devastated this town of
40,000 people has quadrupled the size of its main cemetery.
   Dozens of gravediggers in orange coveralls have buried between
5,000 and 6,000 victims in trench graves, an official at the
cemetery said Wednesday.
   ``We are still pulling out bodies from the debris,'' said the
official, who asked not to be identified. About two acres have been
added to the half acre of cemetery in the past week.
   ``At first we had to bury some people in unmarked mass graves
three deep because there were so many and it was so hot,'' said the
cemetery supervisor.
   In the new graves, 5-inch-thick white stones are set on end to
form a low wall down the middle of the trench. The victims are
buried down each side of the trench about a foot apart.
   A refrigerator truck carrying 67 shrouded bodies in ice waited
next to two 100-foot-long trenches for relatives to arrive for
funerals.
   The official said it was difficult contacting the relatives and
he was unsure how long it would be before the funerals took place.
   The latest victims were so badly injured in the quake that they
died after being hospitalized in Qazvin, about an hour's drive to
the southeast. Manjil is about 180 miles northwest of the capital
Tehran.
   A worker sprayed disinfectant Wednesday from tanks on the back
of a pickup truck over the most recent trenches, containing the
graves of 70 people buried in the morning.
   Most of Manjil, one of the towns hardest hit when the quake
struck one week ago, is piles of rubble. No building escaped damage.
   Ali Taromian, 18, stood grieving at the grave of 30 members of
his family, with a row of whie bricks placed carefully in the dark
red-brown earth along the outlines of the rectangular ditch
underneath.
   Included in the family plot were Taromian's mother, father,
sister and brother. Only one other brother, who was watching soccer
on television with Taromian, survived. The other family members
were asleep in their beds and were unable to react in time to
escape the falling rubble.
   A few yards away in the cemetery, 63-year-old Satar Mochtari
knelt and pounded his gray head on the graves of his three children
and three grandchildren.
   He scrabbled at the earth to show how he had clawed at the
rubble in his home to save his children the instant the quake
stopped. But one-by-one he pulled his 3-, 6- and 9-year-olds out
dead.
   His three other children and wife survived.
   The cemetery official was part of a group of authorities sent by
the city of Tehran to supervise the cleanup because Manjil's own
leadership was lost.
   City hall, which contained the mayor's residence, was destroyed,
killing the mayor and his wife. Their children, ages 6 and 8, were
rescued from the wreckage 26 hours after the quake, said the
official.
   He said 95 people had been rescued by search teams, some of the
survivors found by trained dogs brought in by teams from France and
Italy.
   The wind roared from the town aross the cemetery Wednesday with
such force it was difficult for visitors to walk into the blast.
   Manjil, in a mountain pass, is a natural wind tunnel for
currents passing at an average of 60 mph between the Saudi desert
and the Siberian steppes.
   Temporary stones have been set over the quake victims' graves,
with the name written in Farsi on a white cloth tied around the
stone.
   About 10 of the stones in the most recent ditches were marked
simply ``unknown.''
   A bunch of flowers lay on a neighboring grave, and nearby two
brown porcelain birds were stuck into the ground above a child's
grave, identified only as Ali.

<HEAD>House Panel OKs New Controls on Cable Services</HEAD>

   A House subcommittee approved a bill to place
new cost and competition standards on the cable television industry
amid warnings that irritated viewers are watching to see what
Congress will do about poor service and soaring prices.
   Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Tenn., noted Wednesday that cable TV is a
consumer issue affecting 52 million viewers who are also voters.
   The message was not lost on the House Energy and Commerce
telecommunications subcommittee as it approved, by voice vote, a
bill designed to control prices for basic cable TV services and
ensure competition.
   A Senate committee earlier this month gave near-unanimous
approval to a similar measure.
   Rep. Matthew Rinaldo, R-N.J., who helped subcommittee Chairman
Edward Markey, D-Mass., draft the compromise bill, predicted the
measure would pass the House this year.
   He said he would urge President Bush to sign the bill, although
Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher and Justice Department
officials told the House they opposed the measure.
   Several subcommittee members promised to try to amend the bill
later to allow telephone companies to compete with cable. Major
floor fights are expected over that proposal in the House and
Senate.
   Congress in 1984 deregulated the cable TV industry. But consumer
complaints about poor service and high charges prompted
introduction of bills to rein in an industry that Rep. John
Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce
Committee, calls an unregulated monopoly.
   ``This is a very significant consumer victory,'' Gene Kimmelman,
legislative director of the Consumer Federation of America, said of
the House bill. If enacted, ``It will finally bring cable rates
down to reasonable levels and promote competition ... most usefully
in rural America.''
   Kimmelman has maintained that cable subscribers are paying twice
what they should in the absence of effective competition.
   The House bill, he said, ``could actually lead to rate rollbacks
for the communities that have experienced extreme (rate)
increases.''
   The cable TV industry condemned the bill.
   ``We are very troubled by this bill,'' said James Mooney,
president of the National Cable Television Association. ``We do not
support it.''
   Mooney said ``many important issues remain to be resolved'' when
the bill goes to the full Energy and Commerce Committee.
   Provisions of the bill include requirements that:
   _Cable systems provide a ``basic tier'' of local broadcast and
public TV channels, with the Federal Communications Commission to
decide on maximum rates for this tier. Pay channels such as Home
Box Office would not be regulated.
   _The FCC develop criteria to identify ``unreasonable or abusive
rates'' for cable-owned programs such as MTV and CNN. The Senate
bill would allow FCC scrutiny only if a rate increase for these
programs were challenged, and if the rates were found to be
``significantly excessive.''
   _Programmers provide their signals for the backyard satellite
dish industry and home satellite users.
   _The FCC study whether to limit the number of cable systems one
company may own or limit cable operator ownership of programming.

<HEAD>Study Finds Thinning of Arctic Ice</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 55 cubic miles of ice disappeared from a
Nevada-size section of the Arctic over 11 years, suggesting
scientists should study the Arctic more closely for signs of global
warming, a researcher reported today.
   The 15 percent decline is large for an area where scientists had
thought ice was consistently thick, said researcher Peter Wadhams.
   But it is impossible to know whether global warming played any
role, he said.
   Wadhams, of the University of Cambridge in England, presented
his Arctic ice study in today's issue of the British journal Nature.
   Scientists predict a gradual warming of the Earth from a buildup
of gases such as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The gases trap
solar energy like a greenhouse around the Earth.
   Such a warming could lead to hotter summers, altered rainfall
patterns that could disrupt agriculture and flooding in coastal
areas, scientists say.
   Using data from submarine-based studies in 1976 and 1987,
Wadhams calculated changes within a 112,000-square-mile triangle
north of Greenland. That is slightly larger than Nevada.
   Wadhams studied the thickness of the submerged portions of huge
floating chunks of sea ice. That is a good indicator of total ice
thickness.
   He found that average thickness dropped from 17.5 feet in 1976
to 14.9 feet in 1987, about a 15 percent decrease. Over the study
area, that corresponds to a loss of nearly 55 cubic miles of ice,
he said.
   The missing ice did not necessarily melt away. The main reason
for the decrease, Wadhams suggested, may be that thick ice broke
apart in the months before the 1987 reading. That would leave open
water that would freeze into relatively thin ice. This would reduce
the overall average thickness for the region he studied.
   Such a mechanism would have nothing to do with global warming,
John Walsh, a University of Illinois meteorology professor, said in
an interview. But other factors may have been at work too, he said.
   ``The jury's still out on this,'' Walsh said.
   Thinning of Arctic ice can be an early sign of global warming,
Wadhams wrote. But it is impossible to tell whether global warming
played any role in his findings, because he lacks data from between
the two years he sampled or from years since 1987, he said.
   The findings show that scientists must do more extensive
monitoring to determine if Arctic ice is getting thinner or whether
changes like the one he found are simply natural variations, he
said.
   A Nature editorial called the new results ``provocative'' and
agreed that more studies will be needed to discern true trends in
the ice thickness.
   ``No data published so far can provide a reliable indication of
whether the sea ice of the Arctic Basin is thinning, thickening or
remaining essentially constant,'' wrote Alfred McLaren and Roger
Barry of the University of Colorado at Boulder and R.H. Bourke of
the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif.
   McLaren, in an interview, said he believes Wadhams' results were
due to natural variations in weather. ``I think that's all we can
say right now until we know more,'' he said.

   A consumer advocacy group today released a
nationwide compendium that identifies nearly 7,000 medical
professionals who have been disciplined by state and federal
agencies.
   The roster, two inches thick and titled ``6892 Questionable
Doctors,'' lists actions taken against physicians, dentists,
chiropractors and podiatrists in 40 states and the District of
Columbia.
   ``If your doctor is among the 6,892 on this list, you ought at
least to question the quality of his or her care. At the very
minimum, you should find out why,'' Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of
the Public Citizen Health Research Group, said in a statement
released with the compilation.
   Although the nation's system for protecting the public from
incompetent physicians has ``vastly improved'' in the past 15
years, it is still inadequate, said the group, founded by consumer
activist Ralph Nader.
   ``Gaps the size of the Grand Canyon may have shrunk to Texas
arroyos (desert streambeds), but they still snake everywhere across
the landscape,'' the group's report said.
   ``And those dangerous doctors who fall through the cracks
continue to kill, maim, defraud and otherwise injure their
unknowing patients.''
   The state-by-state consumer guide contains the names of doctors
who have been disciplined by state medical boards, Medicare or the
federal Drug Enforcement Administration.
   Also, each state's section lists names of doctors who have
addresses in that state and were disciplined by medical boards in
other states. It also contains the reason for the action, where
available.
   Public Citizen said its compendium is the first such nationwide
roster available to the public.
   The federal government is preparing to open a National
Practitioner Data Bank listing information on state disciplinary
actions, malpractice payments and revocation of hospital privileges.
   However, Public Citizen has complained that this information
will not be available to the public. It will be accessible
primarily to hospitals, health maintenance organizations and
government agencies.
   Public Citizen asked state medical boards and federal agencies
for actions taken against doctors since 1985. Some states provided
actions that went back even further, while others provided data for
only the last year or two.
   Still others didn't provide any information at all.
   State medical boards in Alabama, Alaska, Colorado, Oklahoma and
South Dakota ``adamantly refused'' to provide the requested data,
Public Citizen said.
   Five other states _ Arizona, Arkansas, Maine, Mississippi and
New Mexico _ were willing to provide at least some information, but
for various reasons did not, Public Citizen said.

   Candidates plotting strategy for the
1992 presidential race shouldn't make plans quite yet to trade the
snows of Iowa and New Hampshire for California sunshine.
   The nation's most populous state may not shift its presidential
primary after all.
   Four months ago, California was on the brink of shaking up the
presidential nomination system by making its primary one of the
earliest in the country.
   A bill to move the presidential primary from early June to the
first Tuesday in March had passed both houses of the Legislature in
different forms.
   Some supporters were predicting that delegate-rich California
would overshadow Iowa and New Hampshire and become the first major
stop on the campaign trail for presidential hopefuls.
   ``If you're a candidate running for president do you want to be
trudging around in the snow or do you want to be in California?''
asked Assemblyman Mike Roos, a Los Angeles Democrat.
   But the early primary bill has been languishing in a two-house
conference committee since late February. The delay is blamed on a
dispute over when the state should hold its primary for state and
congressional candidates and by the press of other business.
   Senate President Pro Tem David Roberti, a Los Angeles Democrat,
said the bill has bogged down partly because ``everybody is
suspicious that the other side is trying to get a partisan
advantage.''
   He gives the legislation a 50-50 chance of becoming law.
   Most legislators agree that the state should hold an earlier
presidential primary. The June primary is one of the latest in the
nation, meaning that presidential nominations usually are wrapped
up by the time Californians vote.
   California voters have not played a key role in a nomination
battle since 1972, when George McGovern defeated Hubert Humphrey in
California and went on to win the Democratic nomination.
   If the early primary had been in effect in 1988, Californians
would have voted three weeks _ instead of four months _ after the
New Hampshire primary, giving themselves a big voice in determining
the Republican and Democratic nominees.
   Debate on the legislation has focused on whether the state and
congressional primary should still be held on the same day as the
presidential primary.
   Under the proposed legislation, the state would continue to hold
one primary _ in March in presidential election years and in June
in non-presidential years.
   Democratic leaders support that approach, saying that otherwise
voter turnout would drop off for state and congressional races.
   But Senate Republican leader Ken Maddy said members of his
caucus won't support a consolidated March primary. They fear that
new legislative districts drawn to reflect the 1990 census might
not be in place in time for March 1992, and the current legislative
districts favor Democrats.
   Republican leaders want a March presidential primary and a state
and congressional primary in September, saying that would reduce
spending for legislative and congressional races.
   Aides to the bill's chief author, Democratic Assemblyman Jim
Costa, say the conference committee may not meet on the dispute
until August.
   Democrats control both houses of the Legislature and could pass
the legislation by themselves. But without substantial GOP support
they could face a veto by Republican Gov. George Deukmejian that
they couldn't override.
   ``The governor has his signature and I don't think the governor
would do something that's opposed by a significant number of
Republicans,'' Roberti said.

<HEAD>FHA Borrowers Would Need More Money Up Front</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First-time home buyers seeking federally
backed mortgages would pay more money and need larger down
payments, under legislation approved by the Senate.
   The bill also authorizes a $3 billion increase in government
spending on housing programs next year. It was approved by a 96-1
vote Wednesday night with only Sen. William Roth, R-Del., objecting.
   The measure also would extend for two years the $124,875 ceiling
on FHA-insured mortgages that Congress last year raised from
$101,250 in most high-cost areas.
   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp joined Senate sponsors earlier
Wednesday in announcing a bipartisan agreement on key elements of
the bill, which represents the biggest revamping of federal housing
policies since 1968.
   Senate Banking Committee Chairman Don Riegle, D-Mich., said the
bill ``charts a way out of a decade-long slide that has left 2
million Americans homeless.''
   ``In the 1980s ... two-thirds of the families poor enough to get
federal help with housing got none at all,'' Riegle said. ``And,
after 35 years of rising steadily, home ownership plummeted in each
of the last 10 years.''
   But private lenders vowed immediately to oppose the Senate
changes in the Federal Housing Administration mortgage insurance
program when the issue reaches the House floor after Congress' July
4 recess.
   ``The compromise effectively closes the door to home ownership
for thousands of American families,'' said Warren Lasko, head of
the Mortgage Bankers Association of America.
   Home buyers with FHA-backed loans would have to have at least a
5 percent down payment and would be required to pay at least
two-thirds of closing costs up front, without financing. Loans with
low down payments, deemed most at risk to default, would be subject
to an added annual fee.
   Under the compromise, according to lawmakers, the up front costs
to a young family ``in a typical case'' buying their first home
with an FHA-insured mortgage would rise from $3,500 to $4,400.
   Borrowers currently can finance all closing costs, sometimes
resulting in loans greater than the value of the home, on
FHA-backed mortgages.
   Lasko estimated that 75,000 to 150,000 first-time home buyers
would be closed out of FHA-backed loans. He called the change ``the
result of an overreaction to the savings and loan scandal.''
   The FHA insurance program lost $4.2 billion to bad loans in
1988, and its net worth has declined from $8 billion to $2.6
billion over the past decade.
   Auditors have warned that without at least an annual 4 percent
increase in housing values, the mortgage insurance fund could
require a massive infusion of taxpayer funds to remain solvent,
just like the savings and loan bailout.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., a principal sponsor of the housing
bill, had opposed changing the FHA rules last week but agreed to
them in exchange to the administration dropping its opposition to a
$3 billion increase in federal spending on housing.
   As passed, the legislation would authorize $18.1 billion in
spending in fiscal 1991, $19.5 billion in 1992 and $21 billion in
1993, compared with the $14.5 billion being spent this year.
   In exchange for the new funds, Kemp's so-called Homeownership
Opportunity for People Everywhere program, to encourage tenant
purchase of public housing units, would get $1.9 billion over the
next three years.
   Kemp said the administration supported the greater spending,
despite budget constraints that prompted Bush a day earlier to
swallow his no-tax-increase pledge. But he noted the final amount
will depend on budget talks.
   Under the agreement, Senate Democrats also get their Housing
Opportunity Program, which consolidates 10 existing housing
programs funneling federal dollars to local governments for
renovating or building housing.
   Democrats agreed to allow part of that money to be spent on
vouchers for the poor to use for rental housing, despite the
Senate's rejection of a similar amendment last week.

<HEAD>S&amp;L Debate Splits Senate on Regional Lines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The issue of who pays for the savings and loan
bailout is dividing Congress along regional lines.
   As the high price tag hits home, Northeastern lawmakers who have
already agreed to the bailout are voicing resentment that so much
of their constituents' money is flowing to the Sun Belt.
   That resentment is threatening to spill over into other spending
issues from housing to water projects to farm programs.
   The first winds of this regional storm swept over the Senate on
Wednesday as legislators from the Northeast and Midwest angrily
challenged a move by Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, to shift federal
housing grants to the populous Sun Belt states.
   Gramm's bid fizzled, but not before senators exchanged heated
words for more than two hours on the Senate floor.
   ``This amendment has the possibilities of creating enormous
regional animosities, of tearing us apart at a time when we need to
be coming together,'' said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.
   By turning the S&amp;L issue into a regional fight, the debate was
significant in that it cut across party lines. Pundits and
politicians have been predicting that the thrift crisis would
become a major campaign issue, but the floor debate had members of
both parties line up on opposite sides.
   Kerry said Gramm's proposal reflected an insatiable appetite for
federal tax dollars. The bailout was a disaster with many villains,
Kerry said, and it was a necessary solution.
   ``We're willing to do that. It's been done. We accept it,'' he
said of the bailout. ``But apparently it isn't enough.''
   Kerry spoke ominously of a farm bill about to come to the Senate
floor. The bill ``with goodies galore'' for Western and Southern
farm states, may have trouble getting through the Senate, he warned.
   If Gramm and others move to tilt other federal programs in favor
of the Sunbelt, Kerry said, ``the repercussions are going to play
out as we debate the farm bill.''
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., got into the fray by
threatening to block a water resources development bill which
contains a substantial amount of money for Texas. Moynihan chairs a
Senate subcommittee that is handling the bill.
   And Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., challenged Gramm by offering
his own amendment to the housing legislation. D'Amato's proposal
would have required Texas and other states with high S&amp;L failure
rates to give up housing money in proportion to the bailout dollars
they were receiving.
   D'Amato argued that lax state regulations in Texas led to the
S&amp;L slide. New York taxpayers, meanwhile, were being asked to pay
for a sizable portion of the bailout.
   ``The state of New York is on the hook for $17.3 billion to
clean up a problem that its citizens did not cause and who will
receive no benefit from its solution,'' D'Amato said.
   Gramm shot back that the S&amp;L bailout money wasn't being poured
into the coffers of the state of Texas or the bank accounts of its
citizens. Rather, he said, it was paying back insured depositors,
many of them high-roller investors from the Northeast.
   He called the idea of using ``trumped-up amendments based on the
S&amp;L bailout'' a ``cute and clever'' tactic.
   ``To in any way equate the S&amp;L bailout with a formula for
allocating community development block grant funds, a formula that
in its current incarnation is absolutely unfair, is just
outrageous,'' Gramm said. ``I'm not trying to beat a regional horse
here.''
   D'Amato admitted that his amendment was more of a symbolic
gesture than a serious effort at legislation. But he said it
reflected genuine anger.

<HEAD>News Reading _ and Watching _ Hit New Lows Among the Young, Study
Finds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans under age 30 know less about what's
going on in the country and the world than any other generation in
the past 50 years, according to a study of how people keep up with
the news.
   It found that Americans aged 18-30 are less likely than earlier
generations to have read a newspaper or watched a television news
show. Twenty-five years ago, 67 percent of people under age 35 said
``yes'' when asked if they had ``read a newspaper yesterday.'' Now
only 24 percent say ``yes.''
   Television news-watching has dropped, too. Young people who said
they watched the TV news ``yesterday'' fell from 52 percent in 1965
to 41 percent this year.
   The study said that from 1941 to 1975, young Americans were on a
par with their elders in public knowledge and in following most
major news events closely. But since 1975, young people have been
less attentive and the trend is accelerating, it said.
   ``The Information Age has spawned ... an uninformed and
uninvolved population,'' concludes the study. It was conducted by
the Times Mirror Center for the People and the Press, sponsored by
the company which publishes the Los Angeles Times. The center's own
polls and those of four other polling organizations taken over the
years were analyzed.

<HEAD>Administration Official Says WIC Not an Emergency</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A money shortage that could force 240,000
low-income women and children out of a government nutrition program
is not an emergency, an administration official says.
   Meanwhile, a bill that will help states get more money for the
supplemental food program for women, infants and children, or WIC,
was moving quickly through the House.
   The House education and labor committee approved a measure by
Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio, to let states borrow a greater amount of
next year's WIC appropriation to cover current shortages. Hall
introduced the bill Monday and a vote on the House floor could
occur Thursday, officials said.
   House members criticized the Department of Agriculture, which
administers WIC, for not seeking more money for the program, which
has been battered in at least 20 states by food price increases and
rebate reductions.
   ``It's an absolute outrage,'' said Rep. John Bryant, D-Texas.
``Why isn't the administration up here urging an emergency
supplemental appropriations bill?''
   ``This program faces a dire crisis,'' said Rep. Barbara Boxer,
D-Calif., who chaired a hearing on WIC by the House budget
committee's task force on human resources.
   Betty Jo Nelsen, administrator of the USDA's Food and Nutrition
Service, said $11 million was being reallocated this week to make
up for spending or budget shortfalls in some states.
   ``It will clearly not be enough,'' Ms. Nelsen said. But, when
pressed by task force members, she refused to call the funding
shortage an emergency.
   ``I would characterize it as a very difficult situation,'' Ms.
Nelsen said. ``I would save severe crisis or emergency for when we
can't serve women and children with medically related nutritional
risks.''

<HEAD>Company Recalls Blood Pressure Drug</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A New York drug company is recalling a generic
drug used to treat high blood pressure after the Food and Drug
Administration alleged the company submitted false information to
the agency.
   Interpharm Inc. of Plainview, N.Y., agreed Wednesday to recall
all three strengths of clonidine hydrochloride tablets from
distributors and pharmacies and to conduct an audit of its 24 other
products, the FDA said.
   The drug comes in small, round, blue tablets marked ``IP 47.''
   Routine testing by the FDA found that ``samples of clonidine
hydrochloride 0.3 milligram tablets submitted for bioequivalence
testing by Interpharm were not the same as the product on the
market,'' the agency said.
   The tablets Interpharm was marketing were blue, and in its
application for approval the company told the FDA its tablets were
blue. But the pills that were tested for bioequivalence before the
drug was approved were peach-colored, the FDA said.
   The agency said it found no manufacturing or production data
that indicated the company had ever made any peach-colored pills.
   The FDA said it had no evidence of a safety problem with the
drug Interpharm was marketing, but questions whether the product is
therapeutically equivalent to the brand name drug, Catapres, made

   FDA officials advised patients who use the product to consult
with their physician about switching to another product.

<HEAD>Abortions Getting Harder to Find in Rural Areas, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Abortion services are getting harder to find
in rural parts of the country and in some areas women have to
travel hundreds of miles to a provider, a report by the Alan
Guttmacher Institute said Wednesday.
   Nearly all of the nearly 1.6 million abortions performed in 1988
were performed in metropolitan areas. About 1.7 percent _ a total
of 27,000 _ took place in rural areas, according to the survey by
the independent, non-profit research group.
   In 1979, when 1.5 million abortions were performed in this
country, about 4.5 percent of them, around 67,000, were in rural
facilities.
   As the concentration of abortion services has continued to shift
from hospitals to specialized clinics, women in rural areas have
been hit hardest. Those women usually have had to rely on hospitals
for abortion services, since small clinics often are not economical
in rural areas, the report said.
   ``Our findings clearly show that access to abortion, which was
already a tremendous problem for women living outside of the
metropolitan areas of our country, is getting worse, even without
additional state restrictions that may result from any new
legislative activity,'' Stanley Henshaw, author of the report, said
in a statement released with it.

<DATELINE>SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wind-whipped wildfires, some caused
by arson, destroyed more than 300 homes Wednesday in Southern
California, officials said.
   One blaze destroyed 280 homes in Santa Barbara and Goleta alone,
said Jan Bullard, spokesman for the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's
Department.
   ``The fire is incredible. It came down from the mountains. It
spread everywhere. It burned everything in its path,'' said another
sheriff's spokesman, Tim Grasey.
   Fires burned dozens more homes in the hilly Los Angeles suburb
of Glendale and in El Cerrito in Riverside County, authorities said.
   The Santa Barbara County fire was labeled arson. An unidentified
incendiary device was found at the point where the fire started,
officials said.
   The fire closed southbound lanes of Highway 101, a principal
north-south California route, and burned a train trestle, forcing a
Santa Barbara-to-San Diego Amtrak train to be held in Oxnard. It
also burned a Sheriff's Department honor farm, set a fire station
ablaze and forced evacuation of the jail.
   The blaze burned in the region where former President Reagan
maintains his ranch, but it was not immediately known if the flames
threatened the property.
   ``I've never seen anything like it,'' said Brenda Rein, who
watched from a shopping mall as fire marched down a mountain. ``The
whole sky was just orange. I looked up and saw the moon through the
smoke, kind of a werewolf moon.''
   The fire hit an area ravaged by a four-year drought, with water
reserves at their lowest in memory.
   The fire near El Cerrito, about 60 miles east of Los Angeles,
destroyed 15 homes, said California Department of Forestry
spokeswoman Jeaneen Gardner. She said no more homes were believed
threatened. The blaze there began when a U.S. Forest Service
``control burn'' to clear brush raged out of control, she said.
   Fire destroyed or damaged 32 homes in Glendale, Fire Battalion
Chief Chris Gray said. More than a dozen of the $300,000-$700,000
houses burned to their foundations.
   Arson was suspected in the Glendale fire, Gray said. ``At this
time, we have found a point of origin and a butane lighter,'' Gray
said. He said a pin had been inserted in the lighter to keep it
burning. ``That alone signals arson.''
   About 1,000 students and teachers were evacuated from Glendale
Community College in the middle of classes Wednesday as flames
moved within yards of the campus.
   An arson blaze in Orange County, south of Los Angeles, spread
over 1,500 acres to the San Bernardino County community of Sleepy
Hollow. Three homes were engulfed and 2,000 residents were
evacuated, forestry officials said.
   Peter Reyes, 29, was arrested for investigation of arson, said
Maria Sabol, a fire department spokeswoman.
   A 125-acre fire near Hemet, in Riverside County, east of Los
Angeles, injured 17 firefighters. In the Moreno Valley area, fire
destroyed three homes.
   Smaller brush fires burned in San Diego and Ventura counties and
in Cleveland National Forest in Riverside County.
   Fires were not the only problem, as the region coped with
blistering heat.
   Utilities from the coast inland to Las Vegas asked the public to
reduce electricity consumption.
   The mercury soared to 109 in downtown Los Angeles, seven degrees
over the old 1976 mark for June 27. Tuesday's 112-degree mark was
an all-time high, topping the old 110-degree record set Sept. 4,
1988.
   Temperatures topped 100 in valleys north and east of Los
Angeles. Palm Springs hit 116 by early afternoon. San Diego was a
record 91. Santa Barbara tied its record of 109.
   Heat began building in the region at the end of last week and
soon erupted into a full-blown heat wave. Heat apparently killed a
4-year-old Los Angeles boy who got into an abandoned car in the San
Fernando Valley on Tuesday.
   The heat wave was spawned by an enormous, upper-level, high
pressure over New Mexico that beat back the normal cooling
influence of the Pacific.
   ``I liken it to a huge umbrella sitting over the Southwest and
it's just baking under there, but it's not quite reaching San
Francisco,'' said National Weather Service meteorologist Art
Lessard.

<HEAD>Top Contras Hand Over Guns; End of Nicaragua's Civil War is
Proclaimed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FILADELFO ALEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN PEDRO DE LOVAGO, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After nine years of civil
war that claimed about 30,000 lives, Nicaragua is finally at peace.
   ``I feel proud and happy as a Nicaraguan woman and mother
because the boys have turned over their arms so Nicaragua can live
in peace,'' President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro said Wednesday
after a ceremony in which top Contra rebel leaders gave up their
weapons.
   ``We're going to disarm everyone peacefully, without hate and
without resentment,'' she said.
   During the ceremony formally ending the war, about 100 rebel
commanders turned over surface-to-air missiles and automatic rifles
to international observers from the United Nations and Organization
of American States.
   The international force destroyed the Contra weapons with
blowtorches on the spot in San Pedro de Lovago, about 100 miles
east of Managua, the capital.
   The town is in the heart of the security zones established for
the disarmament and voluntary resettlement of the Contras.
   ``Today the war ends,'' presidential spokesman Danilo Lacayo
said.
   Shortly after the ceremony, 14 people, most of them journalists,
were seriously injured when two helicopters carrying them back to
Managua collided during takeoff.
   The Contra commanders were led by Israel Galeano, who had turned
over a first batch of weapons, including 62 U.S.-made Red Eye
missiles, to the head of the U.N.-OAS force, Gen. Agustin Quesada.
   ``We hope this signifies that peace will endure in Nicaragua,''
Galeano told the Spanish general.
   ``It is an honor to say to the Nicaraguan people: `Mission
accomplished.' The struggle has been to establish a government of
laws in this country,'' Galeano said, handing over his own rifle.
   The Contras, who were trained and supported by the United
States, claim credit for forcing the former Sandinista government
to call the Feb. 25 election that Mrs. Chamorro won.
   After losing the election, the Sandinistas allegedly distributed
tens of thousands of automatic weapons to civilian supporters,
urging them to ``defend the conquests'' of the Sandinista
revolution.
   Mrs. Chamorro pledged during Wednesday's ceremony to ask local
officials nationwide to ``tell me in writing'' where Sandinista
arms caches are hidden.
   The Contras had cited the arming of the civilian population of
this nation of 3.6 million people when they missed several previous
deadlines to disarm.
   They finally began turning in their weapons on May 8, two weeks
after the Sandinistas handed over power to Mrs. Chamorro.
   U.N. officials now say that only about 1,000 members of the once
18,000-strong rebel force still have their guns.
   He gave up the first batch of missiles on Tuesday in the town of
El Amendro, 190 miles southeast of Managua in Rio San Juan
Province, where the Contras have been promised land on which to
settle.
   He said the United States had given the Contras more than 100 of
the Red Eye missiles in the last four years of the war. He claimed
the rebels had downed 35 government aircraft with them.
   The war, which was accompanied by harsh U.S. economic sanctions
that helped bring the Nicaraguan economy to a virtual standstill,
is seen as the key factor behind Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega's
stunning electoral loss.
   Although a cease-fire has been in place since early 1988,
sporadic combat _ and the hated military draft _ continued along
with U.S. economic pressure.
   Washington lifted the sanctions after Mrs. Chamorro's victory
and sent Nicaragua $300 million in badly needed foreign aid.
   Mrs. Chamorro abolished the draft on April 25, the day she took
office. She later announced plans to reduce to army to half its
current strength of more than 90,000.
   Nicaragua had amassed Central America's largest armed force with
huge infusions of aid from the Soviet Union and its allies.

<BYLINE>Legislative Chief's Convoy Attacked

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Assembly's
president says one of his police escorts was hit by gunfire in an
attack he blamed on leftist rebels, who have recently promised not
to attack civilian officials.
   The rightist politician, Ricardo Alvarenga, said no one was
injured. There was no immediate rebel comment on the reported
attack Wednesday night.
   Alvarenga told a news conference he was driving his pickup truck
home from the legislature when the police car traveling in front of
him was struck by several bullets. He said he accelerated to escape.
   The lawmaker, a member of the governing Republican National
Alliance (ARENA), said another vehicle following his and carrying
bodyguards was also struck by gunfire.
   Alvarenga blamed the attack on the leftist Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front, which has for 10 years fought a
succession of U.S.-backed governments.
   The rebels, who are discussing peace with government
representatives in monthly meetings, said in a communique earlier
this year they would refrain from attacking civilian government
officials.
   On Wednesday, a judge issued an arrest warrant for an army
officer accused of destroying evidence in the November massacre of
six Jesuit priests, their cook and her teen-age daughter.
   The government is under pressure from the rebels to resolve the
Jesuit case. The rebels demanded army officers be made accountable
for rights abuses at the latest round of peace talks that ended
this week in Mexico.
   The warrant was issued after widespread criticism of the
investigation into the massacre by a U.S. congressional committee
and leaders of El Salvador's Roman Catholic Church.
   The charges accuse Lt. Col. Carlos Camilo Hernandez of
destroying the mission logs of troops accused in the shootings at
Central American University.
   Hernandez, an executive officer of the elite Belloso Battalion
in San Salvador, is the former assistant director of the military
college where the troops were stationed.
   The warrant was issued by Judge Ricardo Zamora, who is handling
the politically charged investigation. It asks military officials
to arrest Hernandez and hand him over to the civilian court for
prosecution.
   Neither the armed forces press office nor the U.S. Embassy would
comment on the latest development in the Jesuit case.
   Defense attorney Joaquin Barahona said the judge based his
warrant on the testimony of several witnesses as well as statements
by Hernandez himself.
   Hernandez is the 10th person charged in the case.
   The director of the military college, Col. Guillermo Benavides;
three lieutenants; and five enlisted men have been charged with the
slayings.
   No Salvadoran officer has ever been prosecuted for a human
rights crime, despite the deaths of tens of thousands of people at
the hands of death squads linked to the armed forces or President
Alfredo Cristiani's ARENA party.
   To date, the only evidence presented against Benavides has been
that of other defendants, which is not admissible in Salvadoran
courts. However, a key military witness appeared before the judge
Wednesday in a closed hearing.
   Col. Carlos Armando Aviles, who reportedly blew the case open by
telling a U.S. military adviser who was responsible for the
slayings, arrived Wednesday in El Salvador from Taiwan, where he
had been sent for ``military training'' after the Jesuit massacre.
   ``Aviles is a key witness,'' a defense lawyer, requesting
anonymity, told The Associated Press. ``If he testifies to what he
has said unofficially, it will be overwhelming evidence against the
defendants.''
   Asked about the latest developments in the Jesuit case at a news
conference Wednesday, Cristiani would only comment: ``If the judge
thinks he has proof he should proceed according to the law.''
   The massacre took place during a huge offensive by leftist
rebels. Army positions at the college had come under fire several
times.
   The six priests and educators, their housekeeper and her
15-year-old daughter were roused from their sleep before dawn Nov.
16 and killed by troops of the elite Atlacatl infantry battalion.
   Two of three lieutenants leading the death squad said Benavides
issued an order to kill the priests.
   The investigation has moved slowly and there have been reports
that crucial evidence has been destroyed, that military witnesses
have been given assignments abroad to keep them from testifying,
and that the true masterminds of the slayings were being protected.
   The far-right considered the left-leaning Jesuit academics
subversive because they blamed social injustice, rather than
international communist expansion, for El Salvador's revolution.
   The murders provoked an international outcry and calls from some
quarters in the U.S. Congress for sharp cuts in aid to El Salvador,
the largest recipient of U.S. aid in the hemisphere.

<HEAD>Stocks Dip In Tokyo, Dollar Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index retreated
moderately today after a sharp climb the previous day, and the
dollar edged up against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 206.56 points, or 0.64
percent, closing at 32,106.19.
   The index fell quickly in the morning as market players turned
cautious after Wednesday's 740.98-point gain, traders said. At the
end of morning trading, it was down 258.52 points.
   It rebounded somewhat in the afternoon as investors bought
electric issues that have been performing well this year, said
Masahiro Umemori, an analyst with Nomura Securities Co.
   Trading was thin, with first section volume estimated at 450
million shares, down from Wednesday's 600 million.
   The dollar closed at 154.42 yen, up 0.07 yen from Wednesday's
154.35-yen finish. It opened at 154.57 yen and ranged between
154.27 yen and 154.63 yen.
   Dealers said dollars were being sold above 154.60 yen and bought
at around 154.20 yen in technical position adjustments.
   ``Trading lacked direction in the absence of market-affecting
news,'' said Koichiro Amaya, a dealer with Chemical Bank in Tokyo.
   The dollar opened higher following dollar-buying in the Sydney
market, which opened earlier than Tokyo's. But the currency
weakened toward the end of morning trading.
   Dealers said participants adjusted positions before a series of
important political and economic events scheduled next week.
   Among them are German monetary unification, the U.S. Federal
Reserve Board's open market committee meeting and the Soviet
Communist Party congress.
   About $7.07 billion changed hands in spot trading, down from
Wednesday's $12.16 billion.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds was down to 86.75 points at 5 p.m. from
Wednesday's close of 87.05. The yield stood at 7.240 percent, up
from the previous day's 7.175 percent.

<HEAD>Fundamentalists Suspected In Acid Attack on Journalist</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A journalist who covers the war in
Afghanistan for a Western news agency was in critical condition
today after being attacked with acid, officials said.
   Moslem fundamentalists were blamed by a newspaper which employs
the journalist, Mansoor Khan, 25.
   Khan, Peshawar correspondent for the English-language newspaper
The Democrat, suffered burns over more than half his body and could
lose sight in one eye, doctors and newspaper executives said.
   Khan, who also works for the British-based Reuters news agency,
was attacked by two masked men who broke into his house early
Wednesday in western Peshawar, police said. They beat him up, then
threw acid on him, police said.
   No one claimed responsibility for the attack. Khan has been
reporting on the mujahedeen guerrillas' 12-year-old struggle to
overthrow the Soviet-backed government of Afghanistan.
   His accounts at times have been critical of the insurgents.
   In a stinging front-page editorial today, the Democrat accused
fundamentalists of trying to kill Khan.
   ``When politics come to be infested by fanatics and
fundamentalists of the sort we encounter in our life today,
journalists who stand by their principles invite the ire of the
extremists,'' the editorial said.
   Moslem fundamentalists have been blamed for a number of attacks
and threats against foreigners living in Peshawar, as well as
Afghans working for Western relief organizations.
   A radical organization called the International Jihad
Organization has been blamed for threats against several aid
groups. It also has been blamed for the June 16 attempted murder of
the director of the Australian-based Shelter Now International and
a death threat against the director of the U.S.-based International
Rescue Committee. Both are Americans and have left the country.
   Little is known about the group. It is believed to be linked to
Hezb-i-Islami, or Party of God, the most anti-West of the seven
Afghan resistance parties based in Peshawar.
   As Washington and Moscow move closer to a political settlement
of the war, diplomatic sources say, many Afghans have launched an
anti-West campaign to counter what they see as a U.S. attempt to
push the fundamentalists to the sidelines.

<TEXT>
   The withdrawal of Peace Corps
volunteers highlights the vulnerability of the estimated 140,000
Americans in this country as they become steadily drawn into its
21-year-old Communist insurgency.
   U.S. officials announced Wednesday that they were suspending
Peace Corps operations in the Philippines and sending the 261
volunteers home because of intelligence reports that Communist
rebels planned to kill or kidnap them.
   Volunteers were to begin leaving by commercial flights after
President Corazon Aquino invited them to an emotional farewell
ceremony at the Malacanang presidential palace.
   Many in the group wept as volunteer Kim Rylander of Denison,
Texas, told the president she regretted leaving the Philippines
``because I left my heart here.''
   Mrs. Aquino promised the volunteers to investigate the threats
against the Peace Corps, which has assigned volunteers to the
Philippines for nearly 29 years. She said she hoped Washington
``will reassess the situation'' and allow volunteers to return.
   American officials refuse to elaborate on the reported rebel
threat. But the decision to evacuate volunteers shows that U.S.
diplomats take it seriously.
   That represents a dramatic shift in U.S. perceptions of American
vulnerability in the Marxist insurgency. For years, it had been
widely assumed that Americans were somehow invulnerable to
systematic rebel attack.
   But since April 1989, eight Americans, including six affiliated
with the U.S. military, are believed to have been slain by the New
People's Army, the armed wing of the outlawed Communist Party of
the Philippines.
   Last month, the rebels claimed responsibility for killing two
American airmen outside the U.S.-run Clark Air Base and vowed more
assassinations until all U.S. troops leave the country.
   In reaction, the U.S. military scaled down an exercise,
restricted movement of its personnel and even offered to ship
soldiers' families back home free of charge. The actions were all
in reaction to the rebel threat.
   A senior American official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
insisted that the decision to suspend Peace Corps operations did
not mean the rebels were gaining strength or that Washington was
losing confidence in Mrs. Aquino.
   Instead, the official said the rebels were resorting to
terrorism because the Armed Forces of the Philippines was slowly
winning the war.
   The American official said recent security precautions had
prevented the rebels from killing senior U.S. diplomats or military
officers and that the guerrillas are now aiming to hit ``soft
targets,'' such as Peace Corps volunteers.
   The official said it was better to remove the volunteers based
on a single intelligence report rather than risk having a single
volunteer killed or kidnapped.
   But if that be the case, how will the United States respond if
the New People's Army further expands its target list to include
American businessmen and other civilians?
   According to the U.S. Embassy, there are up to 140,000 Americans
in the Philippines, including about 40,000 affiliated with the
military. Protecting all of them is impossible.
   U.S. officials acknowledge that the rebels are targeting U.S.
government employees and troops but insist there is no sign that
civilians are at risk.
   Last week, however, Philippine military sources said captured
rebel documents indicate the guerrillas plan to step up attacks on
foreigners in the next six months.
   The first Americans slain in the insurgency were three naval
officers killed in a 1974 ambush near the Subic Bay naval base.
After that, rebels avoided targeting Americans for more than 12
years, though many of the villages around the sprawling U.S.-run
Clark Air Base are longtime New People's Army strongholds.
   That changed in October 1987, when rebels killed three Americans
in coordinated attacks outside Clark, 50 miles north of Manila.
U.S. officials believe the attacks were ordered after American
ambulances evacuated Philippine soldiers wounded in a rebel ambush.
   In April 1989, rebels killed U.S. Army Col. James ``Nick'' Rowe
in an ambush in suburban Quezon City. Since then, seven other
Americans are believed to have been slain by the rebels.
   By all signs, the rebels have steadily become less selective in
their targets.
   In public statements, the rebels claim American civilians are
not at risk if they avoid involvement in the government's
counterinsurgency. Rebel sources say they are after ``quality
targets,'' such as senior diplomats and military officers.
   But except for Rowe, all Americans slain by the rebels since
1987 were either military enlisted men or civilians without
important posts. The two airmen killed last month were on temporary
duty in the Philippines and apparently picked for assassination at
random.
   Last month, the State Department cautioned Americans to be
careful traveling in the Philippines. But they have not been told
to stay away or leave.
   The U.S. official insisted that Americans were safe in Manila
and major tourist destinations if they exercise routine precautions.
   But within the past month, the guerrillas have killed several
Filipino soldiers, including a colonel, in broad daylight on major
streets in the capital.

   Assassins hired by drug bosses are being
blamed in the killings of another seven policemen, and authorities
say a judge who handled drug trafficking cases has also been shot
to death.
   Three of the policemen shot to death Wednesday were killed on
the streets of the northwestern city of Medellin, headquarters of
the world's largest cocaine gang, a spokesman with the city police
department said by telephone.
   The other four policemen were killed in the town of Dorada,
about 75 miles north of the capital of Bogota. They were in a
patrol car when gunmen in a passing car opened fire with submachine
guns and pistols, police said in a news release carried by the
radio network Caracol.
   The Medellin cartel has unleashed a bloodbath against Colombian
policemen, especially in Medellin. Including Wednesday's deaths,
132 policemen have been killed in the city this year.
   The cartel has said it will pay about $4,300 for each policeman
killed in Colombia. Drug traffickers and government security forces
have been locked in a deadly war since the slaying last August of a
presidential candidate who advocated extradition of drug suspects
to the United States.
   Also Wednesday, police in Medellin deactivated a car bomb
comprised of 1,000 pounds of dynamite, the police spokesman said.
   The dynamite was in a taxi and was armed with a fuse and
detonators, the policeman said. The taxi was in a parking lot only
about a half-block from the city government's administrative office
building.
   It was the second car bomb deactivated in Medellin in a week.
   The judge who was killed, 29-year-old Samuel Alfonso Rodriguez,
was driving a car accompanied by his wife when he was shot to death
in the northeastern city of Bucaramanga, police said in a
communique broadcast by the RCN radio network.
   He was the fifth judge killed since the government crackdown on
drug traffickers began on Aug. 18.
   In the last 10 months, the traffickers have responded to the
crackdown with 283 terrorist acts, including one that brought down
a domestic airliner, that have killed 274 people.

   The controversial French abortion pill has won
backing from the American Medical Association, the nation's largest
doctors' association.
   In a voice vote Wednesday, the AMA's 436-member policy-making
House of Delegates endorsed testing and possible use of the RU-486
abortion pill.
   ``The abortion issue, pro and con, should not interfere with our
ability to conduct all kinds of investigations for all kinds of
problems,'' said Dr. Charles Sherman, chairman of the AMA committee
that recommended support for the pill.
   The pill is not available in the United States, and no U.S.
companies have applied for Food and Drug Administration approval to
market it in this country because, doctors say, they fear running
afoul of the anti-abortion movement.
   Some doctors in the AMA, whose 290,000 members account for about
45 percent of the nation's physicians, said the pill appears safer
and cheaper than surgical abortion and may be useful in treating
brain tumors, breast cancer and other illnesses.
   A leading abortion opponent attacked the AMA action.
   ``I think it is outrageous for doctors to be thinking up better
ways for killing their little patients,'' John Willke, president of
National Right to Life, said in a telephone interview from his
Washington office.
   Some doctors taking part in AMA's annual policy-making session
this week also said they feared the pill being distributed on the
black market.
   The director of the Reproductive Health Technologies Project, a
coalition of abortion rights, family planning and women's health
groups, welcomed the AMA move.
   ``It's extremely important that the AMA, representing the
mainstream medical community in the country, has spoken out,''
Marie Bass said from Washington.
   The drug causes the uterus to shed its lining, as occurs in
menstruation, and expel a fertilized egg.
   RU-486, or mifepristone, was developed in 1980 by the French
pharmaceutical company Roussel Uclaf and approved for use there in
September 1988.
   The following month, Roussel Uclaf pulled RU-486 off the market
because anti-abortion advocates boycotted the company's products.
Two days later, the French government, a minority owner of the
company, ordered it to resume marketing.
   Since then, the anti-abortion movement has inhibited the company
from distributing the drug for testing outside of France, doctors
said.
   They said their action was an attempt to counter that.
   AMA doctors said RU-486 might be effective in treating
meningiomas, which are types of brain tumors, breast cancer,
gynecological malignancies, and Cushings Syndrome, which can induce
high blood pressure, obesity and diabetes.
   In other business at the AMA convention, the House of Delegates
on approved a model plan for mandatory employer-covered health
insurance.
   The package would cost an average of $1,700 a year per employee,
against the current national average of $2,300 to $2,600.
   The AMA also rejected a proposal to censor editorials in the
Journal of the American Medical Association. The Illinois State
Medical Society, angered by several editorials critical of doctors,
had suggested a panel review such material.
   The association also inaugurated C. John Tupper, elected last
year, as its new president. Tupper, an internist from Davis,
Calif., succeeds Alan R. Nelson of Salt Lake City.

<HEAD>Ousted Hungarian Communists Said To Harbor Infamous Terrorist
`Carlos'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX BANDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A decade ago, Communist leaders
harbored the elusive international terrorist ``Carlos'', who
masterminded deadly attacks in Western Europe and is still at
large, the new government says.
   Interior Minister Balasz Horvath said Wednesday that after
incriminating documents were found he ordered an investigation into
the former Communist regime's having provided terrorists with safe
haven.
   Three former Communist officials named by Horvath _ former
Interior Minister Andras Benkei, former President Karoly Nemeth and
high-ranking party official Antal Gyenes _ have denied any
knowledge of or role in sheltering terrorists.
   Horvath said that chief among the terrorists was Ilich Ramirez
Sanchez, alias Carlos, who masterminded a 1975 attack on an OPEC
meeting in Vienna that killed three people and 1984 bombings in
Marseille, France, that killed five.
   The development follows arrests this month in East Germany of
leftist terrorist suspects who officials say were given new
identities and allowed to live there while the Communists were in
power.
   Unlike other Eastern European countries where Communists were
removed from power, in Hungary no Communist leader has been
arrested or charged in connection with activities during 45 years
of Communist rule, which ended with free elections in April.
   Horvath said it was ``obviously a political decision to let
these people (terrorists) come and stay in Hungary.
   ``It remains to be proved that they were undergoing training
here, but the inventory seems to point in a certain direction,'' he
told reporters. He did not elaborate.
   Horvath said the deputy national police chief, Andras Turos,
came to him with the information over the weekend.
   He said the government documents included a 1979 Interior
Ministry report on the arrival of Carlos and his group and a 1980
ministry report saying the terrorists had left behind explosives,
guns, rockets and rocket launchers.
   Horvath said it is not known where the group obtained these
items.
   He said a 1980 letter from Carlos to former longtime Communist
Party leader Janos Kadar thanked Kadar for allowing the group to
use Hungary as a base.
   Kadar stepped down in May 1988 and was replaced by Communist
reformer Karoly Grosz.
   Benkei, the ex-interior minister, was quoted by the Nepszabadsag
newspaper on Wednesday as saying, ``This must be a
misunderstanding. I did not deal with such matters. I retired in
1980. Hiding people? Nonsense. Lies.''
   Nepszabadsag, a former Communist Party paper, reported that
Carlos and his associates were indeed in Hungary in those years.
   Citing a ``well-informed'' but unnamed source, the paper stated
that ``a very small circle of leaders knew about the authorization,
and their stay was ... (safeguarded by) state security organs.
   ``According to the information we have, their stay was not
linked to any terrorist action, but was to provide the terrorists
rest and recreation,'' Nepszabadsag reported.
   Another Budapest daily, Magyar Hirlap, said Wednesday that there
had been a terrorist training camp at Csopak, on the northern shore
of Lake Balaton, but provided no further information.
   Horvath told reporters that there has been no evidence uncovered
so far that Carlos and his group were in Csopak.
   Carlos, a Venezuelan sometimes called ``The Jackal,'' headed
Interpol's most-wanted list in 1975.
   The son of a wealthy Communist lawyer, Carlos has been linked
with a bombing Dec. 31, 1984, in Marseille that killed five people
and wounded 41.
   He is also accused of plotting the 1975 hijacking of an Air
France jetliner to Uganda that ended with the Israeli commando raid
at Entebbe airport, and the kidnapping of 11 OPEC oil ministers in
Vienna in which three people were killed.

   The dollar strengthened today as dealers continued
to study the repercussions of President Bush's recent reversal on
new taxes.
   Dealers felt that while higher U.S. taxes will help solve the
country's budget deficit and encourage lower interest rates, there
is little sign that the Federal Reserve is likely to lower rates
soon.
   Some traders thought new taxes would lead to a weaker dollar.
Others said a lower U.S. budget deficit, combined with a shrinking
trade deficit, would boost confidence in the U.S. economy and
ultimately produce a firmer dollar.
   The dollar weakened in Europe on Tuesday in the immediate
aftermath of Bush's remarks on taxes, but recovered most of its
losses during Wednesday morning trading.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.07 yen to a closing 154.42 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 153.60 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Wednesday:
   _1.6655 West German marks, up from 1.6625
   _1.4130 Swiss francs, up from 1.4033
   _5.5970 French francs, up from 5.5775
   _1.8735 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8700
   _1,224.00 Italian lire, up from 1,217.50
   _1.1704 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1705
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound, and was
quoted at $1.7352, compared with $1.7445 late Wednesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $350.40 a troy ounce, up
from $350.05 bid late Wednesday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $350.90.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $351.00, up from $349.90 late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $351.34, up from
Wednesday's close of $350.55.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $4.81 a troy ounce, from
Wednesday's $4.84.

<TEXT>
   Beating a court deadline by three hours, Los
Angeles County's Board of Supervisors redrew one of its voting
districts to make it roughly half Hispanic.
   The plan, adopted 3-2 Wednesday, was prompted by a federal
judge's ruling June 4 that the board had illegally kept Hispanics
from getting elected by redrawing the boundaries in 1981 to spread
their numbers across several districts.
   U.S. District Judge David Kenyon had imposed a deadline of 3
p.m. Wednesday to correct the violations of the federal Voting
Rights Act. He will consider the plan on July 5.
   The supervisors drew the new boundaries by carving up Supervisor
Ed Edelman's district.
   Edelman condemned the plan and predicted the judge would reject
it. He said the proposed district is only 46 percent registered
Hispanic voters, shy of the more than 50 percent demanded by the
judge.
   Supporters of the plan said they hoped the judge would consider
the so-called ``push'' factor _ the assumption that there are more
voting-age people in an area than have actually registered.
   Kenyon's ruling followed a lawsuit by the U.S. Justice
Department, the American Civil Liberties Union and the Mexican
American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. They contended the
board had illegally diluted Hispanic voting strength.
   Hispanics make up about 35 percent of the county's 8.7 million
people. But no Hispanic has been elected to the board since 1875.
   The judge has said that if the board fails to correct violations
of the Voting Rights Act, he will redraw the district.
   The Mexican-American group refused immediate comment on the
redistricting plan.

   Soldiers wearing masks and civilian
clothes opened fire today on the funeral procession for a slain
Communist rebel, killing two mourners. They also arrested 21
people, police said.
   The shooting came shortly before President Corazon Aquino told
departing U.S. Peace Corps volunteers that her government would
never allow ``the disciples and supporters of violence'' to achieve
victory.
   She was referring to Communist rebels who allegedly planned to
kill Peace Corps volunteers, forcing U.S. officials to suspend the
group's operations in the Philippines and order staffers home.
   More than 50 mourners were approaching the capital's North
Cemetery with the body of Benjamin Tabuena, 42, a former member of
a rebel assassination squad, when at least five gunmen in civilian
clothes ordered pallbearers to stop and lie face down.
   Witnesses said two of the mourners, including one pallbearer,
tried to run but were shot and killed. As the shooting erupted,
mourners scurried for cover.
   Some gunmen seized film and cameras from news photographers at
gunpoint. Tabuena later was buried by cemetery workers on orders
from the gunmen.
   ``It was like an ambush,'' said one witness, who asked that his
name be withheld to prevent reprisals.
   After the shooting stopped, the masked gunmen rounded up male
mourners, searched them at gunpoint and hustled them away.
   Capt. Arsenio Pinacate, spokesman for the military's Capital
Command, said the gunmen were soldiers on an authorized mission to
arrest rebels. He did not explain why they wore masks and civilian
clothing.
   Pinacate quoted Lt. Col. George Alino, commander of the Capital
Command northern sector, as saying the troops fired after suspected
rebels resisted arrest but did not elaborate.
   Pinacate said mourners were arrested after they waived
``subversive placards'' during the funeral march.
   A policeman at a nearby precinct said two Capital Command
officers brought 21 people alleged to be rebels to the station. The
policeman would not give his name.
   Tabuena was a member of the Alex Boncayao Brigade, the Manila
wing of the New People's Army. The brigade is believed to have
killed scores of police and soldiers in the capital this year.
   Tabuena was slain June 18 after he and four others assassinated
a policeman. Tabuena's daughter, Almeira, said none of those
arrested was a member of her father's group. They were simply
friends and neighbors who turned out for his funeral, she said.
   The New People's Army, the military branch of the outlawed
Communist Party of the Philippines, has been fighting for 21 years
to establish a Marxist state.
   International and local human rights groups have frequently
accused police and soldiers of violating civil rights in connection
with the counter-insurgency campaign, despite Mrs. Aquino's
oft-stated pledge to respect individual liberties.

<TEXT>
   On the sixth night of the nine-day JVC Jazz
Festival, a program featuring American song proved to be a
pleasant, off-beat event.
   Compared to some of the festival's over-amplified concerts in
larger halls, the Town Hall theater off Times Square had the
feeling of a small nightclub. The place, the players, the audience
all combined for a thoroughly enjoyable Wednesday evening of jazz.
   First came Barbara Lea, a graceful singer whose enunciation and
phrasing were impeccable. Despite a balky microphone, she gave the
evening a romantic touch with some Vincent Youmans' standards _
among them, ``I Want to Be Happy'' and ``Time on My Hands'' _ from
the 1920s and 1930s. Deftly accompanying her were the Keith Ingham
Trio; Dick Sudhalter on trumpet and flugelhorn provided some apt
punctuation.
   Next the evening's Odd Couple: the scholarly Dick Hyman on piano
and the street-smart Ruby Braff on cornet. But what lovely music
they made _ first some selections from Alan Jay Lerner's and
Frederick Loewe's ``My Fair Lady,'' then a Fats Waller stride piece
``Hand Full of Keys.'' Hyman's solo performance of ``Blue Skies''
made that classic new. They finished up with ``If I Could Be With
You One Hour Tonight.''
   Gerry Mulligan and his quartet distinguished themselves after
intermission and sent the crowd, murmuring with pleasure, into the
warm night.
   Saxophonist Mulligan sang only one song _ ``I Never Was a Young
Man'' _ and that largely without a microphone, but his instrumental
songs were highly satisfying, among them a Brazilian-accented ``A
Gift for Dizzy'' and a tender ``Song for Strayhorn.''
   ``An Evening of American Song,'' as the program was named,
deserves a rerun. It showcased some solid performers and charmed
several generations of jazz-lovers in the audience.

<TEXT>
   Three early oil paintings by 19th
century Dutch master Vincent van Gogh have been stolen from a small
provincial museum in this southern town, the third theft in two
years of Van Gogh works.
   The paintings taken Wednesday night from the Noordbrabants
Museum were identified by the museum as ``The Sitting Farmer's
Wife'', ``The Digging Farmer's Wife'' and ``Wheels of the Water
Mill in Gennep''.
   Guy Jennings, an Impressionism expert at Christie's auction
house in London, said by telephone that such minor works by Van
Gogh are worth about $1 million each but would be virtually
impossible to sell on the open market.
   Peter Veenland, a member of the museum's board of directors,
confirmed the theft of the paintings, the museum's only three works
by the painter.
   Dutch radio quoted police as saying the paintings were stolen
from the museum 55 miles south of Amsterdam after entry was
apparently gained through a broken window.
   The alarm system at the museum was not functioning and police
were called by a neighbor who heard the sound of breaking glass,
the radio said.
   It did not say whether the alarm was disabled during the theft
or was out of order before the break-in.
   A police spokesman reached by phone would only confirm that the
paintings were missing.
   The paintings date from about 1884, known as the artist's
Brabant period, when he worked among the farmers and rural artisans
of the Brabant, which encompasses a large part of the southern
Netherlands.
   Paintings from Van Gogh's Brabant period are generally dark in
tone and employ none of the bright colors of his later French
period, which have brought record auction prices.
   ``They really are Flemish School pictures before he really
discovered Impressionism,'' said Jennings, the Christie's expert.
   ``The Sitting Farmer's Wife'' and `The Wheels of the Water Mill
in Gennep'' were on loan from the National Fine Arts Service, said
Service spokeswoman Marry de Zwaan. ``The Digging Farmer's Wife''
was owned by the museum.
   The vast treasure trove of art owned by the Dutch nation is not
insured.
   There was speculation in the Dutch art world that the paintings
were stolen for ransom rather than resale, since underground sales
of stolen art usually realize only 10-15 percent of a painting's
open market value, Jennings said.
   The most significant of the Dutch impressionist's works are held
by Amsterdam's Van Gogh Museum and the Kroeller-Mueller Museum near
the eastern Dutch town of Otterlo.
   In December 1988, three Van Goghs, including one version of his
famous depiction of rural poverty, ``The Potato Eaters,'' were
stolen from the Kroeller-Mueller.
   In May of that year, three other works by modern masters,
including Van Gogh's ``Carnations,'' were taken from Amsterdam's
Municipal Museum.
   All the stolen works were subsequently recovered.
   Wednesday's theft came during the final weeks of a major
exhibition of hundreds of Van Gogh's paintings and drawings at the
Van Gogh Museum and the Kroeller-Mueller.
   No thefts or vandalism have been reported at the show, which
marks the centenary of the artist's death.

   A woman wounded in the massacre at an
auto loan office has died, raising the death toll to 10.
   Jewel Belote, 50, a stenographer at the General Motors
Acceptance Corp., died Wednesday from her gunshot wounds, said
Vince Scolaro, a spokesman at University Medical Center.
   Seven workers and one customer were killed and five people were
wounded June 18 by James Edward Pough, who opened fire in the
office before killing himself. In January, GMAC repossessed Pough's
car, then notified him in March that he still owed $6,394.
   The weekend before the office shooting, Pough killed two people
and wounded two others on Jacksonville streets, authorities said.
   Two of the people wounded in the office shooting _ a worker and
a customer _were released from hospitals Tuesday. Two employees
remain hospitalized.

   ``If Israel expands their settlements in any way, or if they add
a single new settlement, I will make a flat commitment to support
any request made by the administration to reduce aid to Israel in
next year's bill,'' said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis.
   The comments set Obey, chairman of the House Appropriations'
foreign operations subcommittee, on a collision course with the
newly installed right-wing Israeli government, which has promised
to expand settlements in the territories seized in the 1967 six-day
war.
   In Jerusalem, a top aide to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said
today he regretted such warnings.
   Yossi Ben-Aharon, director-general of Shamir's office, would not
say whether Israel planned such expansions.
   ``I don't want to answer any questions on settlements because it
would only inflate their importance. We hope that the issue will be
removed from the agenda of U.S.-Israeli relations,'' he told The
Associated Press.
   Obey issued the warning as the House approved a $15.7 billion
aid bill for the year beginning Oct. 1, which includes Israel's
customary $3 billion in military and economic aid, making it the
largest single recipient of U.S. largess.
   The overall bill represented what Obey termed the start of a
gradual turn away from America's emphasis on military aid to its
friends and allies around the globe, and toward economic
development and trade. It cut nearly $400 million President Bush
had sought in military assistance and put the money into aid to
Africa, refugees, children and Eastern Europe.
   As it worked through a pile of proposed amendments to the bill,
the House also voted narrowly to preserve President Bush's policy
of not sending U.S. aid to international family planning groups
linked to abortion, and to keep non-lethal aid flowing to
Cambodia's non-communist resistance.
   Obey said he meant his comments on Israeli settlement as ``a
very friendly warning'' intended to head off developments that
could further jeopardize peace in the unstable region. He said the
amount of any aid cut would be based on how much is spent on
expanding present settlements or creating new ones.
   ``Israel is a sovereign nation and has the right to do anything
they want. But the U.S. government has no obligation to fund,
either directly or indirectly, settlements which we believe to be
an impediment to the peace process,'' he said.
   On the population issue, the House voted 224 to 198 to send $3
million through private groups for family planning and other health
projects in Romania, whose people have for decades been subject to
a government policy against contraception.
   But the amendment, offered by Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J.,
excluded two groups from participation _ the United Nations
Population Fund and the International Planned Parenthood Federation
_ which participate in abortion counseling, referral or services.
   Smith's opponents argued that those two groups are the only ones
that now operate in Romania, so barring them would make any aid
program for that country ineffective. But Smith and allies
countered that Bush would veto any bill that included funding for
the two abortion-linked agencies.
   The lawmakers also adopted, 260 to 162, an amendment by Rep.
Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., to provide $7 million in non-lethal aid to
the coalition opposing Cambodia's Vietnamese-installed government.
That replaced language in the bill barring any aid to the
resistance, a prohibition supported by members who feared the
dominance of the Khmer Rouge in the coalition.
   The Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia in the 1970s and were responsible
for the deaths of more than 1 million people in what became known
as ``the killing fields.'' They are the strongest military faction
in a coalition which also receives millions of dollars in covert
U.S. military aid.
   The bill _ the principal vehicle for U.S. military, economic and
development aid to friends and allies _ still faces serious
objections from the White House because of a provision cutting
military aid to El Salvador.
   The measure would withhold half of next year's $85 million in
aid and apply conditions intended to keep the warring government
and leftist FMLN rebels at the peace table. Negotiations on a new
bipartisan policy toward El Salvador are being conducted separately
between Secretary of State James A. Baker III and a team of House
Democrats and Republicans.

   Communist Party radicals said today they had
virtually given up hope for major reforms of their party and
predicted a schism at the upcoming congress, despite President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's appeals for unity.
   Leaders of the Democratic Platform, a group struggling to
drastically change the Communist Party from within, told a news
conference that they were unimpressed by party efforts at internal
reform.
   ``In reality, despite the many statements of leaders, the
Communist Party has shown it is simply incapable of reforming
itself,'' said Vladimir Lysenko, one of the group's leaders.
   The proposed split in the Communist Party would be the first
since 1922, and Gorbachev, the party's general secretary, has
warned that it would divide and weaken the forces struggling for
reform.
   Hard-liners appeared to be consolidating their strength before
the 28th Congress of the Communist Party, due to open in the
Kremlin on Monday.
   The reformist Democratic Platform has the backing of only about
100 of 4,700 delegates at the congress, but is believed to have
much wider support in the party rank-and-file.
   Lysenko said the group would fight for its views at the
congress, but ``if it proves impossible, there will be a statement
that either the Communist Party has split or a new party is
starting.''
   Another Democratic Platform leader, Stepan Sulakshin, said he
expected more than 2 million of the Communist Party's 19 million
members to quit.
   Gorbachev, speaking last week to a congress of Communists from
the Russian republic, said a split in the party would be ``a gift''
to opponents of his reforms.
   Lysenko predicted ``a very hard time for Gorbachev'' from
hard-liners, but the platform leaders said they opposed a proposal
to put off the congress until autumn to stem the conservative tide.
   A plenum of the party's Central Committee is expected to address
the timing of the congress and other issues on Friday, but with
both right and left coming out against it, a postponement appeared
unlikely.
   Lysenko criticized a proposed new set of party rules published
today in the Community Party daily Pravda, as well as a proposed
program published Wednesday.
   The new documents make a pretense at reform, he said, but
remained ``wholly in the old spirit,'' retaining tight discipline
over the party, forbidding factions and refusing to remove party
cells from workplaces.
   The Democratic Platform wants the party to allow factions,
relinquish its massive assets, remove itself from direct management
of the country and become a western-style parliamentary party.
   Party ideology chief Vadim Medvedev said the leadership tried to
accommodate the Democratic Platform as it drafted its new rules and
program, but also tried to build a consensus with the party
mainstream and the traditionalist Marxist Platform.
   The rules make several key changes in the workings of the
Communist Party political machine:
   _The party leader would be called the chairman instead of the
general secretary and be elected directly by the 4,700-member
congress instead of the 249-member Central Committee.
   _The collective leadership would be called the Presidium instead
of the Politburo. It is expected to be enlarged from its current
dozen members to include the heads of the 15 republic parties,
although this is not specified in the published proposal.
   _The Central Committee could be replenished in between
congresses. That would make its membership much more fluid.
   _Party leaders could not be elected to more than two terms in a
row.
   _Republic parties would become more independent.

<TEXT>
   A car bomb exploded near a Syrian army
checkpoint in Moslem west Beirut early today and another wrecked
the office of a pro-Iraqi group in south Lebanon, police reported.
   The explosions killed a 7-year-old girl and wounded 10 people.
   The girl was slain when a bomb exploded near the Baath Arab
Socialist Party office in Sidon, the southern provincial capital,
officials said.
   Four other people were wounded in the blast that devastated the
office on the first floor of a six-story apartment building in the
port city's main thoroughfare.
   Iraq and Syria, ruled by rival wings of the Baath Party, have
been feuding for 11 years.
   In the Beirut bombing, police said six civilians were wounded,
among them an unidentified Sri Lankan woman.
   The Datsun that exploded in the Talet el-Khayyat district 400
yards from the Syrian checkpoint contained about 65 pounds of TNT,
according to an explosives expert. Five cars were set on fire by
the blast.
   It damaged apartment buildings and several shops, leaving the
street littered with broken glass and twisted metal. Residents said
the car had been parked on the street for several days.
   As is usual with bombings in Lebanon, there were no claims of
responsibility.
   A chain of bombings since the Syrian army moved into west Beirut
in 1987 to quell militia anarchy has been seen as a campaign
designed to undermine the Syrian peacekeeping effort.
   Also in south Lebanon, Sunni Moslem militiamen of the Nasserite
Popular Organization battled with fighters of the Israeli-backed
South Lebanon Army east of Sidon, the provincial capital.
   Police reported one South Lebanon Army militiaman was killed and
two Nasserites were wounded in the clashes with mortars,
rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns around Kfar Falous, a
hilltop village east of Sidon on the front line between the two
forces.

<TEXT>
   A top aide to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
said today he regretted warnings that U.S. aid would be cut if
Israel expanded Jewish settlements in occupied lands.
   Yossi Ben-Aharon, director-general of Shamir's office, refused
to say whether Israel planned such expansions.
   ``I don't want to answer any questions on settlements because it
would only inflate their importance. We hope that the issue will be
removed from the agenda of U.S.-Israeli relations,'' he told The
Associated Press.
   But Shamir spokesman Avi Pazner said that ``it's obvious that
nobody has sought to put limits on existing settlements.''
   Pazner dismissed as ``pure speculation'' reports that Shamir and
his ultra-rightist coalition partners had agreed to build 5,000 new
housing units a year in the settlements. Five thousand new units
would house 25,000 people.
   The recent report by the Haaretz daily also said that by
September, 1,050 new housing units will be completed in the
settlements, bringing 6,800 more settlers into the occupied lands.
Israel captured the territories in the 1967 war with its Arab
neighbors.
   According to a recent survey by the newspaper, 84,000 Jewish
settlers live in the West Bank and 4,000 in the Gaza Strip.
Previous figures put the number of West Bank settlers at about
75,000 and those in Gaza at 2,500.
   U.S. Rep. David Obey, chairman of the House Foreign Aid
Subcommittee, said in Washington on Wednesday he would support cuts
in U.S. aid to Israel if its government persisted in expanding
settlements in the occupied territories.
   ``The U.S. government has no obligation to fund, either directly
or indirectly, settlements which we believe to be an impediment to
the peace process,'' said Obey, D-Wis.
   President Bush has spoken out sharply against Jewish settlements
in the occupied lands, and the issue has been a main factor in the
deteriorating relations between the two allies.
   Referring to Obey's warning, Ben-Aharon said: ``We regret this
attitude.''
   Ben-Aharon said Israel's top priority was the absorption of
Soviet Jewish immigrants. ``We are not taken up now with the
subject of settlements because the big agenda item is
immigration,'' he said.

   The City Planning Commission approved the laboratory

<HEAD>Shamir Proposes Way to Choose Palestinian Delegation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir today proposed to
President Bush that Israel have a say in approving Palestinian
delegates for proposed Middle East peace talks, Israel and army
radio reported.
   The reports said the proposal, in a letter to Bush, opposed the
inclusion of deportees or Palestinians from Arab east Jerusalem, as
suggested by Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   Israel has objected to what it views as attempts to give the PLO
an indirect role in the talks. Under the U.S. plan, the Palestinian
delegation would hold preliminary peace talks with Israelis in
Cairo, Egypt.
   Shamir's office confirmed the prime minister sent the letter to
Bush today in response to a letter from Bush two weeks ago. The
Bush letter urged Israel's new right-wing government to advance the
peace process and requested answers to Baker's proposals, Shamir's
office said.
   It would not comment on the reported proposal to choose
Palestinian delegates from a pool of names that would require
approval from Israel.
   ``We are ready to continue to cooperate with Secretary Baker to
advance a dialogue with a Palestinian delegation that will be
composed on a name-by-name basis,'' the Israel radio report quoted
Shamir's letter as saying.
   ``But, as you know Mr. President, we disagree with the
participation of deportees and Arabs from Jerusalem in the
delegation.''
   Shamir has opposed participation of exiles or east Jerusalem
residents as demanded by Palestinians. He fears that would be seen
as conceding issues of principle on Palestinian demands to make
Jerusalem the capital of a Palestinian state and to give the right
of return to millions of Arabs living abroad.
   Israel has also objected to giving the Palestine Liberation
Organization an indirect role in the negotiations, claiming the PLO
is a terrorist organization dedicated to the destruction of Israel.
   In his letter to Bush, Shamir shifted the emphasis from the
stalled attempt to start a dialogue with the Palestinians to the
broader question of reaching peace with Israel's Arab neighbors,
the radio reports said.
   Shamir reportedly told Bush the refusal of Arab states to end
the state of war with Israel was at the heart of the conflict in
the region, the report said. He emphasized most efforts should be
aimed at reaching peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors.

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand Ruling that Overturns Most Death Sentences in
Three States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A day after it upheld Arizona's death penalty
law, the Supreme Court today let stand a ruling that had the effect
of overturning most existing death sentences in Arizona, Idaho and
Montana.
   By a 4-3 vote, the justices refused to reinstate the death
sentence of John Harvey Adamson, convicted of murdering newspaper
reporter Don Bolles in 1976.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals previously had struck down
Adamson's death sentence. But the justices Wednesday upheld
Arizona's death penalty law in a decision directly conflicting with
the 9th Circuit court's ruling in Adamson's case.
   In throwing out Adamson's sentence, the appeals court struck
down a key provision of Arizona's death penalty law _ one which was
declared valid by the Supreme Court on Wednesday.
   Idaho and Montana have the same provisions in their death
penalty laws.
   The confusing turn of events apparently was sparked by the fact
that Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, a former state judge in Arizona,
and Anthony M. Kennedy, a former 9th Circuit court judge, took no
part in acting on Arizona's appeal in Adamson's case.
   That left only Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices
Byron R. White and Antonin Scalia voting to set aside the 9th
Circuit court's ruling.
   Justices Willam J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun
and John Paul Stevens, who voted Wednesday to strike down Arizona's
death penalty law, apparently voted to deny Arizona's appeal in the
Adamson case.
   The net result: A Supreme Court decision upholding Arizona's
death penalty law and a 9th Circuit court decision striking it down
both remain on the books.
   The practical effect: It appears Adamson cannot be sentenced to
death.
   Today's high court action was sparked by an appeal filed by
Arizona Attorney General Bob Corbin.
   Bolles, who had been investigating organized crime for The
Arizona Republic in Phoenix, died June 11, 1976, nine days after
his car exploded.
   Prosecutors said Adamson was paid $10,000 to attach a bomb to
the reporter's car. Before dying, Bolles identified Adamson as the
man who had made an appointment to see him the day of the bombing.
   Adamson originally was allowed to plead guilty to second-degree
murder in exchange for his testimony against two others allegedly
involved in the murder plot.
   His testimony helped convict Max Dunlap, a building contractor,
and James Robison, a plumber.
   But the Arizona Supreme Court threw out the Dunlap and Robison
convictions in 1980 and ordered a new trial for them. The two have
not been retried.
   Adamson, who by 1980 was serving a 20-year prison term, said he
would not testify at a new trial unless the state met additional
conditions _ including his release and the government's help in
establishing a new identity.
   After Adamson's refusal to cooperate, state prosecutors filed
first-degree murder charges against him. He was tried, convicted
and sentenced to death.
   The 9th Circuit court threw out Adamson's death sentence in
1986, ruling that he had been subjected to ``double jeopardy.'' The
Supreme Court reversed that ruling and reinstated the death
sentence by a 5-4 vote in 1987.
   The 9th Circuit then considered other issues raised by Adamson's
case, and once again threw out his death sentence.
   The case is Lewis vs. Adamson, 88-1553.

<HEAD>Court Rejects County Attorney's Suit Against Minnesota TV Station</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A St. Paul, Minn., prosecutor who says he was
defamed by a Minneapolis television station's reporting about a
mysterious 1982 death lost a Supreme Court appeal today.
   The justices, without comment, refused to revive Ramsey County
Attorney Tom Foley's libel lawsuit against WCCO-TV.
   A state trial judge threw out Foley's suit before it reached a
jury, and the Minnesota Supreme Court upheld that dismissal last
Dec. 26.
   Kathleen Greening's body was found under water in the bathtub of
her Lauderdale home July 21, 1982. The county medical examiner
initially listed the manner of death as ``undetermined,'' but in
the fall of 1985 was considering changing that designation to
``homicide.''
   WCCO-TV in early 1986 investigated the death and its handling by
the criminal justice system. Its reports were critical of all
public officials and agencies involved in the investigation,
including Foley and his office.
   Foley contended that the WCCO reports libeled him in at least
197 statements, which a state trial judge divided into factual
scenarios:
   _That Foley requested the attorney general's office to remove a
state investigator from the case.
   _That Foley blocked the issuance of a search warrant for the
financial records of Mrs. Greening's husband, one of his campaign
contributors but also a suspect in the murder investigation.
   _That Foley was aware of an inherent conflict of interest
involving himself and Mrs. Greening's husband.
   _That Foley asked Medical Examiner Michael McGee not to change
the death certificate designation from ``undetermined'' to
``homicide.''
   The Minnesota Supreme Court said Foley was not entitled to have
his allegations reach a jury because he had failed to offer enough
evidence of ``actual malice'' _ that the statements were false and
made with knowledge or reckless disregard of their falsity.
   In the appeal acted on today, Foley said the state courts
reviewed the issues and facts of his case with no ``deference to or
mention of the rich record supporting triable issue of actual
malice against'' the television station.
   The case is Foley vs. WCCO-TV, 89-1882.

<HEAD>China Imposes Penalty for Desecrating the Flag</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese who desecrate the national flag can be
imprisoned for up to three years under a law passed by legislators
today.
   The nation's first flag law, adopted by the Standing Committee
of the National People's Congress, also forbids the use of the
standard in advertisements or as a trademark, the official Xinhua
News Agency said.
   Xinhua said wilful damage to a flag is punishable by up to three
years of imprisonment, detention, surveillance or deprivation of
political rights.
   Before the law was passed, China often harshly punished those
who defaced any of its national symbols. Last year a Chinese court
gave a life sentence to a man who during the pro-democracy
demonstrations threw paint on the large portrait of Mao hanging
from Tiananmen Gate.
   In the United States this week, the House of Representatives
rejected a proposed amendment to the Constitution permitting the
enactment of laws making it illegal to desecrate the flag.
   The Chinese law says every citizen and organization must respect
and take good care of the national flag, which shows four small and
one large yellow star against a red field.
   The large star stands for the Communist Party, and the small
stars represent various classes in Chinese society. The red color
represents the Communist revolution.
   The law says China's flag since the Communist takeover in 1949
must be raised every day on Tiananmen Square, at the gate to the
Communist headquarters of Zhongnanhai, in front of various
government and party offices and at ports, airports and border
railway stations.
   All full-time schools must fly the flag whenever school is in
session. Work units and neighborhood committees must raise the flag
on national holidays and other major occasions.
   Flags should be flown at half-mast when Chinese leaders or
foreigners who have contributed to world peace die, or when
disasters cause heavy casualties.
   The law, to go into effect on October 1, China's National Day,
also states that flags may be produced only by officially
designated enterprises.

<TEXT>
   The head of the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency said today that a recent U.N. report by a prestigious group
of scientists on global warming was insufficient to persuade the
United States to take action.
   EPA Administrator William Reilly told reporters that the problem
is not ``understood with the degree of certainty that would
warrant'' taking action to curb emissions of carbon dioxide and
other so-called greenhouse gases.
   Taking such action, which could affect everything from cars to
power plants, would result in ``very substantial economic
dislocation,'' Reilly said at the international conference on the
ozone layer.
   The report, released earlier this month by the United
Nations-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, pooled
the expertise of some of the world's leading scientists.
   It concluded that the earth's temperature has already begun to
warm, and appealed for urgent action to curb emissions of
greenhouse gases to prevent potential climatological disaster.
   But sweeping changes to the U.S. and world economy would be
needed to reduce the burning of fossil fuels that produce carbon
dioxide.
   The United States, the leading carbon dioxide producer, wants
more study into whether global warming is taking place and, if so,
what is causing it. The administration has increased the budget for
research into climate change by 57 percent this year, Reilly said.
   Reilly's comments were the strongest statement so far by an
administration official on the report. They seemed to indicate a
rejection of its unequivocal conclusions.
   ``We do not believe at this time that the evidence is
sufficiently compelling to move us toward the dislocation and
highly expensive interventions that would be required'' to cut
emissions, Reilly said.
   David D. Doniger of the Natural Resources Defense Council in
Washington, accused the United States of refusing to accept the
work of a group it had previously supported.
   ``The U.S. had been saying it was waiting for the report,'' said
Doniger, who is attending the ozone conference as an observer.
``One thing is clear. It is getting harder and harder for our
country to hide behind the veil of insufficient knowledge.''
   The report is bound to figure in discussions next month in
Houston, at the summit of the seven leading industrialized
democracies. Last year's summit declaration dwelt extensively on
environmental issues and the upcoming meeting is being viewed as
the next major step in international global warming policy.
   The final report of the U.N. panel is scheduled for release in
August, before the World Climate Change conference in November in
Geneva.

<HEAD>Defense Makes Final Plea for Demjanjuk's Life</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The lawyer for convicted Nazi war criminal John
Demjanjuk made a final plea to Israel's Supreme Court today to
spare his life, arguing there is enough doubt ``to take the gallows
out of this case.''
   Yoram Sheftel, Demjanjuk's lawyer, ended his appeal by asking a
panel of five justices to overturn the death sentence because of
``lingering doubt'' about Demjanjuk's guilt.
   ``There is no case that potentially could contain a mistake more
than this case,'' he argued.
   Sheftel has argued that Demjanjuk is innocent, a victim of
mistaken identity and not ``Ivan the Terrible,'' a gas-chamber
operator at the Treblinka death camp in World War II.
   The appeal began May 14 and was the longest in Israel's history,
with 13 days of defense arguments and 12 days for the prosecution.
   Sheftel also asked the Supreme Court not to hand down a decision
before Jan. 1 in order to give the defense time to investigate
possible new evidence.
   Chief Justice Meir Shamgar said the justices would consider the
request but did not indicate when they would rule.
   Demjanjuk, a 70-year-old retired Cleveland autoworker, was
convicted and sentenced to death in April 1988 for crimes against
humanity and crimes against the Jewish people. His trial lasted 14
months.
   Three trial judges agreed with the prosecution that Demjanjuk
was ``Ivan the Terrible,'' the Treblinka guard who raped, beat and
slashed Jews as they were forced into the gas chambers.
   More than 850,000 Jews were murdered at Treblinka in
Nazi-occupied Poland in 1942-43.
   A Ukrainian native, Demjanjuk claims he is a victim of mistaken
identity and says he spent those years in several German POW camps
as a captured Soviet soldier.

   Jennifer and Rick Cook drove up the long,
narrow driveway to see what was left of Jennifer's parents' home.
   ``Oh God! Oh God!'' she wailed as their car snaked back into the
hills, passing through thick smoke, ash and embers.
   But there was the house she grew up in _ untouched by the
firestorm that had swept through several hours earlier.
   ``It's OK. It's OK,'' she said, tears streaming down her cheeks.
A few minutes later she was reunited with her parents, Susan and
George Grgich, who credited their home's survival to a new asphalt
roof.
   The Grgiches were among the fortunate _ those who escaped the
3,500-acre inferno Wednesday night in the suburban foothills of
this quiet, wealthy coastal city.
   At least 280 families lost their homes in the blaze, which
leveled entire neighborhoods. Firefighters often could do little
more than soak the remains of what were once $750,000 homes. In
some instances, they were able to save homes adjacent to the worst
damage.
   Utility workers moved from house to house in the early morning
darkness, shutting off gas valves. Otherwise, neighborhoods were
deserted, with the only sound the eerie whistle of a flaming gas
main or the tumble of pots and pans in what was once the cupboard
of a designer kitchen.
   One vantage point revealed a residential landscape dotted by
flames for miles in every direction. Under an orange sky filled
with soot, one resident narrated his escape.
   ``I started reading the paper after I came home from work and
then my 12-year-old said, `Daddy, the back yard is on fire,''' said
Bryan Gaggs, whose home was untouched while those of two of his
nearest neighbors were gutted.
   ``When I finally left the house, I thought my house was already
going. But it turned out to be unscathed,'' Gaggs said.
   About a half-mile away, across a small canyon, seven homes were
destroyed.
   Jerry Neeley, wearing a dentist's mask to breathe through the
smoke, stayed behind to try to save his sprawling residence.
   ``It was like an inferno,'' he said. ``I saw smoke a couple
miles away and had just put hamburgers on. I hurried dinner so we
could all go upstairs and watch the fire. And then it was on us. It
must have traveled several miles in less than 30 minutes.''
   Neeley threw flammable items, including lawn furniture, into his
pool.
   At a Red Cross rescue center in the gymnasium at the University
of California, Santa Barbara, evacuees gathered around a radio as a
roving reporter rattled off the street addresses of homes that had
been burned to the ground.
   One woman, who identified herself only as Sue, heard her street
address called. ``I didn't get one picture,'' she said, sobbing
gently. ``I didn't get a photograph. Not one thing. Not one
memory.''
   Her husband, who has Parkinson's disease, was rescued.
   ``We've got each other,'' Sue said. ``We'll start (again)
somehow.''

   President Bush said today that an agreement to
slash America's huge trade deficit with Japan will reduce tensions
with Tokyo and be ``beneficial for the entire world.''
   ``I welcome and endorse this joint report,'' Bush said in a
written statement after U.S. and Japanese negotiators announced an
accord to trim the United States' $49 billion trade imbalance.
   The president said both countries had identified trade barriers,
``taken initial corrective actions and made commitments to take
further steps to resolve a wide range of structural problems.''
   The agreement emerged from a series of complex negotiations
called the Structural Impediments Initiative, or SII, involving the
removal of barriers to open trading. The president did not spell
out the details of the accord.
   However, Bush said the steps that will be taken ``will have a
positive effect on our economies, encouraging open and competitive
markets, promoting sustained world economic growth, contributing to
a reduction in global payments imbalances and enhancing the quality
of life in both Japan and the United States.''
   He said that although the agreement was only between Japan and
the United States, ``the effects will be beneficial for the entire
world.''
   Bush said the personal efforts of Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu
``were responsible in large measure for the substantial progress''
achieved.
   The president commended Kaifu for ``his strong and courageous
political leadership.''
   In Tokyo, Linn Williams, the U.S. deputy trade representative,
said Bush's willingness to consider tax revenue increases had
helped move the talks forward.
   Bush said the removal of trade barriers ``is a two way street.
   ``As Japan tackles its structural problems,'' he said, ``so must
the United States.''
   He pledged to work with Congress to reduce the mushrooming U.S.
budget deficit and to strengthen public and private saving.
   ``Both our governments recognize that further effort will be
necessary in order to address fully these structural problems and
to maintain the momentum of our adjustment efforts,'' Bush said.
   He said that continuing progress in the SII talks ``can help us
move away from trade disputes, thus allowing us to focus our
efforts on more positive activities as we continue to develop a
global partnership between our two countries.''

   The end of the civil war in Nicaragua brings to a close a period
of bloodshed that has severely scarred this Central American
nation. Here at a glance are some of the key events of that civil
war:

   SANDINISTAS: Left-wing group, known as the Sandinista National
Liberation Front, formed to overthrow the Somoza family. After
Somoza's ouster on July 17, 1979, the Sandinistas abrogated the
1974 constitution and dissolved the bicameral National Congress.

   CONTRAS: The Contras _ Spanish contraction for
``counterrevolutionary'' _ began as a group of about 2,000 former
National Guardsmen considered to be supporters of Somoza who
retreated north to Honduras. Their numbers were swelled with the
arrival of Miskito Indians fleeing the Sandinistas' attempt to
integrate them.

   U.S. AID: Congress approved a covert Contras aid program by the
CIA in 1981, but reduced it two years later and cut it off entirely
in 1984 after allegations were raised about human rights abuses by
the guerrillas. The Reagan administration supported military aid
for the Contras, despite Congressional battles with opposition
Democrats. An estimated $10 million to $30 million in illegal
arms-for-hostages profits were diverted to the Contras in the
Iran-Contra affair.

   The government today acknowledged that
it killed civilians during bombing and strafing raids on Tamil
rebels, and it blamed pilot error for the deaths.
   The deputy defense minister, Ranjan Wijeratne, gave no figures
for the number of civilians killed in savage fighting in Sri
Lanka's north and east.
   At least 1,679 combatants have been killed in the 17-day-old
upsurge in the country's civil war. The latest deaths included 35
rebels killed in fighting Wednesday and today, military officials
said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Four government soldiers
also were killed, they said.
   Most of the air raids have focused on Jaffna, a
densely-populated city of 120,000 in the north.
   ``Some bombs have hit targets which we did not envisage and we
regret that,'' Wijeratne told a weekly news briefing. Wijeratne
denied a rebel claim that the government had used napalm, a
powerful defoliant, in its air attacks.
   Helicopter gunships and bombers have bombed and strafed the town
in an attempt to break a rebel siege on Jaffna Fort, one of two
government military installations in the rebel-controlled north. At
least 225 soldiers and policemen are trapped inside the fort.
   Last week, government helicopters dropped leaflets on the city
warning nearby residents to evacuate their homes.
   To capture the 200-year-old fort, Tamil rebels have attempted to
tunnel under the installation and to scale its walls with
explosives tied to their bodies. Each attempt has failed, the
military said.
   In the briefing, Gen. Cyril Ranatunge also defended military
policy, saying that helicopter gunships did not attack unidentified
targets.
   ``We are not going to kill our own people,'' he said.
   His answer was in response to a reporter who claimed he watched
two helicopter gunships shoot up a village for 15 minutes in
eastern Sri Lanka where there were no apparent rebel fortifications
or targets.
   A helicopter gunship also strafed a vehicle carrying foreign
correspondents, including a Los Angeles Times reporter, on Monday.
The correspondents were not injured.
   Military officials said the government had launched a mass
recruitment campaign to prepare for what many think will be a long
war with the guerrillas. So far 12,000 men, mostly Sinhalese, have
volunteered to fight, military officials said.
   Tamil rebels have waged a war for a separate homeland in the
north and the east since 1983. The fighting has claimed more than
11,000 lives.
   The latest round of fighting ended a 13-month-old cease-fire
negotiated between the government and the rebels in May 1989. The
flareup began June 11 after a Tamil man claimed he was manhandled
by Sinhalese police. Tamil Tiger guerrillas responded by attacking
police stations in the east.
   Members of the mainly Hindu Tamil minority claim they are
discriminated against by the majority Sinhalese, who dominate the
government and military and are predominantly Buddhist.
   Sinhalese make up 75 percent of the island's 16 million people
and control the army and the government. Tamils comprise 18 percent.

<HEAD>Government Conditionally Welcomes Rebel Cease-Fire</HEAD>

   The government today conditionally
welcomed a rebel-proposed cease-fire and transitional government.
   In a long statement issued by the Council of State, the
government said it was possible to ``consider these and other
issues'' if the rebels stop fighting and halt support for
independence of the country's northernmost province.
   Tigrean rebels said Sunday they were ready to implement an
immediate cease-fire if President Mengistu Haile Mariam's
government stepped down and was replaced by a broad-based interim
government that would hold internationally supervised elections.
   The Council of State said it would consider the proposals if the
Tigreans halt their support of a separate insurgency seeking
independence for the northernmost province, Eritrea, and ``refrain
from destabilizing the territorial integrity of the country.''
   A Western diplomat said the government seemed to be testing the
water.
   ``It's sniffing around like a dog to see if the rebels are
serious about becoming engaged in discussion,'' he said on
condition of anonymity. ``Their backs are against the wall. They've
got to take advantage of anything that comes along.''
   The government has held two rounds of inclusive talks with the
Tigreans, both of which have faltered over the rebels' demands for
an interim government.
   Since August, the TPLF, or Tigrean People's Liberation Front,
and its ally, the Ethiopian People's Democratic Movement, have
captured a wide area of northern Ethiopia, including their home
province, Tigre.
   Tigre is the southern neighbor of Eritrea where the Eritrean
People's Liberation Front has been fighting for independence since
1961 in Africa's longest war.
   The Tigreans and Eritreans both long have demanded Mengistu's
ouster and regularly coordinate offensives.
   The Tigreans, in their push south, have come to within 100 miles
of the capital. The Eritreans, meanwhile, have seized all but
Eritrea's provincial capital, Asmara, including the nation's only
deep-water port, Massawa.

   City officials shunned Nelson Mandela
on his arrival overnight in Miami, where the South African
activist's embrace of Cuba's Fidel Castro has driven a wedge
between blacks and Cuban-Americans.
   About 300 demonstrators today joined an estimated 2,000 people
outside a convention center where Mandela was to speak. The
demonstrators, mostly Cuban-Americans, waved placards protesting
Mandela's praise of Castro.
   ``Mandela is a traitor,'' said Ricardo Acabader, who wrapped
himself in the Cuban flag. ``I'm here to fight for human rights.''
   Police kept the two groups apart, although they shouted back and
forth with megaphones and at least one fistfight was broken up.
   Mandela, who earlier Wednesday laid a wreath at the grave of
Martin Luther King Jr. in Atlanta, arrived at Miami's airport just
before midnight to none of the fanfare with which he was met in the
four other U.S. cities he has visited.
   ``We do feel somewhat embarrassed,'' Gerald McEntee, president
of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal
Employees, said after welcoming Mandela. ``Embarrassed for the
state of Florida and embarrassed for Dade County.''
   A crowd of about 200 people who greeted Mandela outside his
hotel early today chanted ``Free South Africa'' and then ``Free
South Florida'' and finally ``Where is Suarez?'' _ a reference to
Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez, who denounced Mandela for his support of
Castro.
   ``We're here to show him our love and appreciation,'' said Doris
Dorcilini. ``We're unhappy that our local politicians are not doing
the same. We're going to remember this when they need us.''
   Mandela, 71, was scheduled to speak today to the AFSCME
convention, but his speech was delayed by 2{ hours. The 1.25
million-member union has been a strong supporter of Mandela's
African National Congress. He was to head to Detroit later in the
day.
   Inside the convention hall, only a small group of Miami-area
officials waited for Mandela, including Dade County Commissioner
Charles Dusseau.
   ``In Miami, opinions tend to be very heartfelt,'' he said.
``That's why you get this kind of reaction. There's been a lot of
suffering on both sides, and it's difficult for each side to
understand the other.''
   After Mandela last week reaffirmed his support for Castro, the
Miami City Commission, with three Cuban-American members, dropped
plans for a welcome proclamation. Five Cuban-American mayors issued
a statement condemning his support for Castro.
   Mayor Alex Daoud of this largely Jewish city criticized Mandela
for supprting not only Castro but the Palestine Liberation
Organization and Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
   Leaders of Miami's black community, wracked by racial violence
four times in the past decade, pledged to avenge the slight to
Mandela.
   ``He is our brother,'' said Johnnie McMillian, president of
Miami's NAACP chapter. ``If they say he's not welcome, they're
saying we're not welcome, too.''
   In an often-moving visit to Atlanta on Wednesday, Mandela paid
silent tribute to the slain leader of the U.S. civil rights
movement, then borrowed from King's ``I Have a Dream'' speech at a
sold-out rally at 46,000-seat Grant Field.
   ``His dreams are certainly going to see the light of day in our
country,'' Mandela said. ``Let freedom ring in South Africa! We
will continue to struggle until we have transformed South Africa
into a united, non-racial, non-sexist, democratic country.''
   Although King espoused non-violence, several prominent civil
rights leaders defended Mandela's refusal to renounce force in the
struggle for racial equality in South Africa.
   ``We who are thoroughly committed to the advocacy of
non-violence nonetheless respect the right of oppressed people
everywhere to seek their own liberation,'' the Rev. Joseph Lowery,
president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference that King
founded, said during a gathering at Big Bethel AME Church.
   ``Rev. Lowery has spoken for all of us and he spoke well,''
King's widow, Coretta Scott King, said to Mandela. ``We support
you; we love you; we revere you.''
   Mandela said black South Africans face a different battle than
the one King led.
   ``Unlike you, we are still under the grip of white supremacy,''
Mandela said. To reporters he added: ``Non-violence is a good
policy when conditions permit.''

<HEAD>Jailed Reporter in Texas Refused Emergency Request</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Supreme Court justice today refused to help
a Texas television news reporter who Wednesday began a six-month
jail term for refusing to surrender the name of a confidential
source in a police killing.
   Justice Byron R. White, acting without any comment, denied an
emergency request by Brian Karem, a reporter for KMOL-TV in San
Antonio. The request had sought to postpone Karem's sentence while
he appeals the contempt-of-court finding against him.
   Karem, speaking from the Bexar County Jail steps Wednesday,
said, ``I sure don't want to do six months in jail but I'm going to
keep my promise.''
   Karem defied three court orders to turn over confidential notes
of a telephone interview with one of two jailed murder suspects
last year. Lawyers for the two suspects in the case say they have
to know who arranged the interviews to assure a fair trial.
   Karem has said the source fears for his life if his identity is
revealed.
   The jailing stems from an interview Karem conducted last year
with capital murder defendant Henry Hernandez, accused with his
brother, Julian, in the March 1989 shooting death of policeman Gary
Williams.
   During the interview, Henry Hernandez said he shot the officer
in self-defense.
   Prosecutors also want Karem's notes, to be sure that no law
enforcement officer made promises that could affect the outcome of
the case in exchange for letting Hernandez talk to Karem.
   The case is Karem vs. Priest, A-929.

   The head of the Justice Department's criminal
division today announced his resignation to enter private law
practice, creating another vacancy in the agency's top ranks.
   Assistant Attorney General Edward S.G. Dennis Jr., a career
federal prosecutor who has headed the criminal division since 1988,
said in a letter to Attorney General Dick Thornburgh that he plans
to leave the Justice Department on Aug. 31.
   Dennis said in a statement that he will become a senior partner
at the prestigious Philadelphia law firm of Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius.
   Dennis's departure adds another vacancy to the top echelons of
the Justice Department, which has been plagued by a series of
personnel difficulties under Thornburgh.
   But officials stressed that Dennis's resignation is unrelated to
the recent staff turmoil, which came to a head in May when Deputy
Attorney General Donald B. Ayer resigned.
   Nevertheless, two sources said Dennis had grown frustrated with
Thornburgh's management style, which had centralized decision
making in the attorney general's office.
   In a statement, Dennis said Thornburgh ``has provided
outstanding leadership to the department, and I am delighted to
have had the opportunity to work under him.''
   In a letter to President Bush, Dennis said his decision to leave
``is based upon family considerations and my feeling that I will
not be a complete lawyer until I succeed in the private practice of
law.''
   Following the resignation of Ayer, who sources say was frozen
out of decision making, Thornburgh reassigned two longtime aides
who had served him when he was Pennsylvania governor.
   The reassignment of chief spokesman David Runkel and chief of
staff Robert S. Ross Jr. was an attempt to counter criticism that
Thornburgh was surrounded by a ``palace guard'' of loyalists,
officials conceded.
   William P. Barr, the acting deputy attorney general who has been
nominated to take that job permanently, told the Senate Judiciary
Committee Wednesday that he is restoring the traditional role of
the agency's No. 2 position.
   Barr, appearing at his confirmation hearing, said Thornburgh's
staff took on more responsibility than the attorney general
intended because of the difficulty recruiting new people at the end
of the Reagan administration.
   Thornburgh, who took office in August 1988, was asked to stay on
as Bush's attorney general.
   The personnel difficulties continued, however.
   Thornburgh's first choice to be deputy, Robert Fiske, was
scuttled by conservatives who objected to the New York lawyers's
involvement in judicial screening by the American Bar Association.
   Dennis, who is the first black to head the Justice Department's
criminal division, also served as acting deputy attorney general
last year. A former U.S. attorney in Philadelphia, Dennis will join
the national litigation group of Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius.
   Officials noted that as a Reagan administration holdover, Dennis
long had plans to leave the department, particularly because he
commutes daily from his home near Philadelphia.
   Several other nominations for vacant positions are pending in
the Senate. Lee Rawls was recently nominated to head the Office of
Legislative Affairs to replace Carol Crawford, who resigned last
winter following a series of bureaucratic turf wars.

<HEAD>Court to Consider Reviving Lawsuit Against Indiana Prosecutor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to consider
reviving a lawsuit against an Indiana prosecutor who advised police
to hypnotize a woman suspected of shooting her children.
   The court said it will review a ruling that the prosecutor is
immune from being sued for such conduct.
   The case stems from a shooting at the home of Cathy Burns in
Muncie, Ind., on Sept. 2, 1982.
   Ms. Burns, who worked as a police dispatcher in Muncie, said an
intruder shot and wounded her two sons, Eddie Griffin and Denny
Sells, while they slept and knocked her unconscious.
   A message scrawled on the bathroom mirror in lipstick said, ``I
took what you loved most.''
   Police suspected Ms. Burns shot her sons and planned to ask her
to submit to hypnosis after she passed lie detector and voice
stress tests.
   Chief Deputy Prosecutor Richard Reed of Delaware County, Ind.,
advised the police to go ahead with the hypnosis. The police
officers said they doubted the technique was lawful because they
had been told during their police academy training that hypnotizing
suspects was unacceptable.
   Under hypnosis, Ms. Burns identified the assailant as ``Katie''
and also referred to herself at one point as ``Katie.''
   The police officers concluded that she had a split personality
and regarded her statement under hypnosis as a confession.
   The police then obtained a search warrant after misleading a
judge by not disclosing that her statement was made while
hypnotized.
   The judge later ruled the statement inadmissible and Reed
dropped the prosecution. But Ms. Burns said Reed continued making
statements to the news media saying he was convinced of her guilt.
   Ms. Burns then sued the deputy prosecutor, accusing him of
violating her civil rights.
   A federal judge threw out the suit. The ruling was upheld in
Feburary by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   ``A prosecutor is absolutely immune from suit when acting as a
legal advisor to police officers,'' the appeals court said.
   The case would be different if Reed had participated in
administering the hypnosis, the appeals court said. But it said it
did not regard what Reed did as participating in the investigation.
   The case is Burns vs. Reed, 89-1715.

<HEAD>Marcos-Khashoggi Case Heading for Jury After Prosecution Rebuttal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Imelda Marcos and Adnan Khashoggi heard
themselves described as willing participants in a complex scheme of
fraud and deception as government prosecutors wrapped up their case
against the pair.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles LaBella delivered a final,
stinging rebuttal to the defense on Thursday.
   He stacked packs of Philippine pesos on the rail of the jury box
to dramatize his claim that Mrs. Marcos knew her husband, the late
President Ferdinand Marcos, was enriching himself by stealing
millions from his country's treasury.
   And he charged that Khashoggi knew a U.S. federal court
injunction had frozen the Marcoses' U.S. assets before he agreed in
1986 to backdate documents to show that he, not they, owned four
New York buildings and some paintings.
   ``When you look at all the evidence you will be convinced beyond
a reasonable doubt that Imelda Marcos is guilty and that Adnan
Khashoggi also is guilty,'' LaBella told the jurors.
   Today, U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan instructed the jurors
on the law in the case. The jurors, who will be sequestered at the
close of his charge, were to begin deliberations in the afternoon.
   Keenan said the jurors can convict only if they find the
defendants' guilt was proven beyond a reasonable doubt after a part of
a broader package including spending cuts to
reduce the deficit.
   On Thursday, the Treasury received nearly $5.39 in bids for
every $1 of four year notes that it wanted to sell as part of a
$8.31 four-year note auction. That was the strongest demand on
record for an issue of that maturity, market analysts said.
   ``The market has handled the supply this week pretty well,''
said James Winder, money market economist for Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets.
   In addition to the four-year note auction, the government sold
$17.2 billion in three-month and six-month bills on Monday and
$11.25 billion in two-year notes on Tuesday.
   Winder said there may also be ``some lingering positive feeling
from the president's change of heart on taxes.''
   There were no new economic reports out today, but Winder said
the ``general perception is our economy is weak.'' Economic
weakness increases chances that the Federal Reserve will encourage
lower interest rates, a developmnet that would boost bond prices.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments were up 1-16 point, intermediate maturities advanced by
between 5-32 point and \ point and long-term issues were up as much
as 9-32 point, according to Telerate Inc., the financial
information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, edged up 1.54 to 1,159.11.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.99 percent as the
discount slipped 3 basis points to 7.74 percent. Yields on
six-month bills fell to 8.05 percent as the discount lost 2 basis
points to 7.64 percent. Yields on one-year bills dropped to 8.07
percent as the discount fell 3 basis points to 7.54 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each
other on overnight loans, was quoted at 8 5-16 percent, unchanged
from late Wednesday.

<HEAD>Lithuanian Parliament Begins Debating Independence Moratorium</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>VILNIUS, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lithuania's prime minister today urged
parliament to freeze the republic's declaration of independence,
saying Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev would then lift an
economic blockade and begin talks.
   Kazimera Prunskiene, opening a critical debate on the proposed
moratorium, said Lithuania could leave in place all subsequent
decisions. Those include replacement of the Soviet Constitution by
a Lithuanian document and a resolution suggesting that Lithuanian
youth can ignore the Soviet draft.
   The debate in the Lithuanian Supreme Council parliament began
after Gorbachev held a series of discussions with Mrs. Prunskiene
and Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis to try to solve their
dispute over Lithuania's March 11 declaration of independence.
   The streets of the Lithuanian capital were calm, and there was
little visible evidence of the economic blockade in which the
Soviet Union has cut off most natural gas, all oil, and a variety
of other raw materials and manufactured goods. The blockade,
imposed in April, has put nearly 50,000 of the republic's 1.1
million workers out of work.
   ``The moratorium is only on the declaration of independence, not
on all the other acts,'' Mrs. Prunskiene said. ``It's a political
statement.''
   ``The status of Lithuania doesn't change and the Supreme Council
remains the same,'' she said, pressing the recalcitrant parliament
to accept a compromise.
   Soviet officials have not commented on the talks Tuesday and
Wednesday between Gorbachev and Lithuanian officials. The only
official statement released late Tuesday said talks with the
republic of 3.8 million people could begin only if it declares a
moratorium. It said the talks can only be held in the framework of
a nationwide discussion of a new treaty of union among republics.
   Lithuania's compromise proposal calls for a three-month
moratorium on independence, but the moratorium would not take
effect until the Soviet Union opened formal negotiations with
leaders of the Baltic republic, government spokesman Ceslovas
Jursenas said.
   Landsbergis, who has been less enthusiastic about a compromise
than Mrs. Prunskiene, did not clearly endorse one in his statement
to the parliament. But he did tell deputies that ``it's most
important to get the negotiations started.''
   He said the Lithuanian leadership wanted to choose the best
conditions for entering critical talks over just how separation
could be achieved.
   The Soviet Union forcibly annexed Lithuania, along with its
Baltic neighbors Estonia and Latvia, in 1940. All three republics
have been seeking to secede, but Lithuania has taken the lead.
   One member of parliament, Eduardas Vilkas, said after listening
to Mrs. Prunskiene that he understood her to be requesting ``a
political step, not a juridical one, to say that Gorbachev is not
the loser.''
   Vilkas said he favored a compromise but that many Lithuanian
legislators opposed the deal. ``This is very difficult
psychologically for many deputies,'' he said.
   Algis Cekuolis, an adviser to the parliament, predicted that the
discussion would be sharp. Some deputies insisted on a two-thirds
majority before agreeing to the compromise, he said.

   Phoenix opened shelters for the homeless and Southern
Californians headed for the beach for relief from a heat wave
gripping the Southwest for a fourth day today. The death toll rose
to at least six in Arizona and California.
   Temperatures soared into the 100s from California to Texas on
Wednesday, causing blackouts in Los Angeles and two more
heat-related deaths in Arizona.
   After back-to-back, all-time records of 120 and 122 degrees, the
heat abated only slightly Wednesday in Phoenix, topping out at 118
_ a record for the date. This morning the temperature plummeted but
it was still a hot 87.
   An enormous high-pressure system over New Mexico created the
heat wave by beating back the Pacific Ocean's normal cooling
influence.
   ``I liken it to a huge umbrella sitting over the Southwest and
it's just baking under there,'' said National Weather Service
meteorologist Art Lessard.
   In Southern California, fires worsened by four years of drought
and the searing heat destroyed some 300 houses, forced thousands of
people from their homes, injured scores of firefighters and closed
highways. One person was arrested on suspicion of arson in Orange
County.
   Nebraska and Wyoming also sweltered under record-breaking heat.
In Wyoming, U.S. Forest Service officials expressed concern that
the hot, dry breezy weather could quickly dry out brushy areas and
increase the fire danger.
   Today's forecast offered no relief. The weather service said
highs would be in the 100s in the inland cities and slightly lower
elsewhere through Sunday.
   Phoenix officials opened shelters for the homeless and
distributed fans to the poor and elderly.
   Bill Maguire, a doctor at Maricopa Medical Center, said 15 to 20
people had been treated for heat-related emergencies by
mid-afternoon, up from 10 on Tuesday.
   ``It's the cumulative effect,'' Maguire said. ``If their
apartment doesn't have air conditioning, maybe they made it through
yesterday and pooped out today.''
   In Yuma, Ariz., some 30 inmates at the county jail filed
protests with the sheriff's office after the tempterature in the
208-bed jail hit 98 degrees, 13 degrees above the maximum set under
a federal court order on jail conditions.
   In Los Angeles, the mercury climbed to 109, seven degrees over
the 1976 mark for the date. Power outages from air conditioning and
other uses were scattered throughout the city; 5,000 customers lost
electricity for a few hours.
   Utilities from the coast inland to Las Vegas asked the public to
conserve electricity.
   Temperatures topped 100 in valleys north and east of Los
Angeles. Palm Springs hit 116 by early afternoon. Normally balmy
San Diego was a record 91.
   Los Angeles County lifeguards bolstered their forces to handle
the throngs seeking relief at the beach, where temperatures were
about 20 degrees lower.
   In Lubbock, Texas, the Postal Service told customers to expect
minor delays in delivery because carriers would be taking more
breaks to drink water and cool off. Lubbock is sweltering through
the hottest June on record, with 18 days of temperatures over 100.
   ``We are concerned for their health,'' said Don Jones, postal
field operations director. ``This is bad weather for them.''
   Not everyone was bothered by the heat.
   ``I live in Arizona. I'm used to it. That's the reason I live
here. The hotter it gets the more it keeps people away. I've lived
here all my life. I love it,'' said Anthony Hardin of Phoenix.
   A 57-year-old suburban Phoenix man died after working outdoors
at his home. His body temperature had reached 108, police said.
Later Wednesday, a 45-year-old woman was found dead in her downtown
apartment, where the temperature had hit 105.
   The deaths of three other people Tuesday in Phoenix also were
ruled heat-related. Authorities in Los Angeles said a 4-year-old
boy died in a parked car with the windows rolled up Tuesday.

   FBI and sheriff's officials said the
$10.8 million holdup of an armored car may have been an inside job,
and they began questioning past and present employees of the
courier service.
   The robbery by at least two men with a shotgun Tuesday was the
biggest armored car heist in U.S. history.
   ``The fact that they had so much money ... it's logical that
they had some information,'' said Paul Bellito, an FBI spokesman in
Buffalo. ``People have to be somewhat familiar with the routes of
travel, what their work habits are, where they stop.''
   The armored car was seized at gunpoint after the driver and
guard stopped at a convenience store for coffee and sandwiches
while making a cash delivery to the Federal Reserve Bank in
Buffalo, officials said. No one was injured.
   The driver and guard told authorities they had been forced to
drive to a wooded area, where they were bound, gagged and
blindfolded. The robbers put money bags weighing at least 1,500
pounds into another vehicle and fled.
   The two employees of the Armored Motor Service of America were
given a lie-detector test, said sheriff's spokesman Tom Ryan. He
would not disclose the results.
   Capt. Neil Flood said dozens of past and present employees were
being interviewed. ``You knock off an armored car, you've got to
know something about the business,'' he said.
   Sheriff Andrew P. Meloni said the unidentified driver and guard
had not been ruled out as suspects.
   FBI agent G. Robert Langford said one of the holdup men was in a
brown outfit similar to the uniforms worn by the armored car
company's guards.
   ``We don't know if that means he was an employee or if the
uniform was used to gain access to the truck or to prevent him from
attracting a lot of attention,'' Langford said.
   Investigators also were trying to determine how the holdup men
penetrated the car's gunport with a shotgun, the Democrat and
Chronicle of Rochester reported today. The sliding metal hatch
should have been locked, the paper said.
   Meloni said the van used in the robbery was found Wednesday as a
result of a telephone tip. It was abandoned in the driveway of a
social club, about five miles from where the holdup took place.
   ``Finding the van quickly is a real break for us,'' Meloni said
today. ``Now the public may be able to tell us where the van has
been.''
   The van, originally dark blue, had been recently painted dull
gray. The van was filled with covered money trays from the armored
car.
   Meloni said some cash was found in envelopes in the van, but he
would not say how much. ``It was very little, comparatively
speaking,'' he said.
   Michael Bucci, AMSA executive vice president, told the Syracuse
Post-Standard that the convenience store stop violated company
policy. However, AMSA controller George Clark said Wednesday there
is no rule prohibiting stops.
   Langford said company insiders are often involved in armored car
robberies, which are particularly difficult to pull off.
   ``In a crime like this, you often see the involvement of a
current or former employee who might have access to information
about routes, times, and the amount of money that is being
transported,'' he said. ``But it's just one possibility.''

   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein says his country
is prepared for a war he views as ``inevitable'' unless Israel
stops what he calls its aggressive policies, a report published
today said.
   The Wall Street Journal quoted Hussein as saying other countries
are mistaken if they believe Iraq is too tired from eight years of
fighting with Iran to ``indulge in a new war.''
   ``Their assessment is totally wrong,'' he said. ``We shall
respond to an Israeli attack whenever it comes and wherever.''
   Hussein called Israel an ``evil entity'' and said the United
States was indifferent to Mideast concerns, but he repeatedly said
Iraq would strike only if Israel strikes first.
   If war happens, he promised it would not end quickly and ``the
outcome will not be one Israel desires.''
   ``Iraq is in possession of binary chemical weapons. Our
scientists and military men calculate this is sufficient enough to
deter an Israeli nuclear attack,'' he said.
   `If the great powers use any opportunity they see available to
suppress others and to reap benefits at others' expense, then the
others will find themselves in a position that will force them to
use any means available,'' he warned.

   Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens Jr. angrily stalked
out of a shareholders meeting today after an auto parts company
refused to give him a seat on its board of directors.
   Earlier, Pickens and 52 American shareholders of his private
investment firm, Boone Co., marched into a luxury hotel near the
headquarters of Koito Manufacturing Co. for the c
shareholders meeting.
   Three hours later Pickens left in a huff before the vote on his

   ``It was a sham, an absolute farce. Here today, Koito completely

   He charged that corporate Japan is a ``closed system'' because
Koito managers wouldn't answer his questions.
   ``If that kind of meeting was in the United States, I'm telling
you, they'd put them all in jail. It's a lousy deal.''
   At the meeting, Boone and others of his entourage asked a numbseases
such as AIDS and
cancer.
   But Wiles has no plans to ``create a bureaucratic situation or
be picky about the little things,'' like an errant piece of garbage
or a slightly lethargic mouse.
   ``I'm looking at the bigger picture,'' he said.

   A Supreme Court justice today refused to help
a Texas television news reporter who has begun serving a six-month
jail term for refusing to surrender the name of a source.
   Justice Byron R. White, without comment, denied an emergency
request by Brian Karem of San Antonio's KMOL-TV. The request sought
to postpone Karem's sentence while he appeals the contempt-of-court
finding against him.
   ``I sure don't want to do six months in jail,'' KMOL-TV reporter
Brian Karem said on the Bexar County Jail steps as he surrendered
to begin serving the jail term Wednesday. ``But I'm going to keep
my promise.''
   The reporter has defied three court orders to turn over
confidential notes of a telephone interview last year with one of
the two suspects jailed in the murder case.
   Prosecution and defense lawyers, who are preparing for the
murder case, contend they need to know who arranged the interview.
Karem has said the source fears for his life if his identity is
revealed.
   ``We can't live up to our principles every day in life,'' Karem
told reporters as he entered the jail. ``But I think this is an
important enough issue and I feel strongly enough about it that I
want to live up to how I believe.''
   Karem had hoped to stay out of jail while he appealed the
contempt citations. But those hopes ended Tuesday when the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals refused to issue a stay.
   Sheriff Harlon Copeland met Karem on the steps of the jail. The
reporter was accompanied by KMOL news director Ron Harig, station
manager Bob Donohue and Karem's father, James.
   Karem said his only hope for release would be for the source to
come forward or for the U.S. Supreme Court to block his sentence
pending appeal.
   ``It does not look very good for the First Amendment today,''
said his attorney, Laurence Macon.
   Harig said the station would hold Karem's job open and continue
to pay him while he is jailed.
   The jailing stems from an interview Karem conducted last year
with capital murder defendant Henry David Hernandez, accused with
his brother Julian in the March 1989 shooting death of police
officer Gary Williams. Henry Hernandez said during the interview
that he shot the officer in self-defense.
   Prosecution and defense attorneys say they have to know who
arranged the interview so that they can determine whether it can be
used in the trial under rules of evidence.
   Henry Hernandez' attorney does not want the interview admitted
in the trial. Julian Hernandez' attorney does.

   While the American West bakes under the
summer sun, winter is arriving in earnest in southern Australia,
with heavy snowfall, high wind and hail causing traffic havoc in
some areas.
   In Sydney, strong wind uprooted trees and snaped power lines on
Wednesday night, cutting power to hundreds of families in the
city's north and southeast. Marine police were kept busy on Sydney
Harbor after boats broke their moorings.
   Some highways were closed by snow and sleet in highland areas of
New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania states.
   A Weather Bureau spokesman said the high temperature was just 49
degrees in Melbourne on Wednesday, the city's lowest June maximum
in four years.
   A gale warning was in effect for all Victorian and Tasmanian
coastal waters. Some areas reported wind of up to 60 mph on
Wednesday night.
   Heavy snowfalls and blizzards were reported at ski resorts in
northeastern Victoria state, and more rough weather was in the
forecast.
   A spokesman for the Bureau of Meteorology in Tasmania, an island
state off Australia's southern coast, said temperatures in the
capital, Hobart, had dipped almost 9 degrees below average to a
minimum of 36 degrees.
   Twenty first-year police recruits were airlifted out of
Tasmania's central highlands today after suffering mild
hypothermia, frostbite and fatigue.
   The superintendent of the Tasmanian Police Academy, Richard
McCreadie, said the recruits, aged about 18 to 25, and their three
instructors were into their third day of survival training in the
Walls of Jerusalem National Park on Wednesday when gales, snow and
sub-freezing temperatures hit.
   ``My understanding is that they are only going to be first-aid
cases,'' McCreadie said. ``Obviously, conditions have been very,
very difficult and these kids have not had much experience.''

   Nelson Mandela touched a raw nerve among some
Americans with his effusive praise of the likes of Libya's Moammar
Gadhafi and Cuba's Fidel Castro and his refusal to renounce
violence.
   In Miami, where Mandela arrived late Wednesday, city officials
bowed to the wishes of angry Cuban-Americans and shunned the
celebrated former prisoner. The Miami City Commission dropped plans
for a welcome proclamation last week after Mandela lauded Castro.
   In effect, Mandela's critics are telling him to be more
discriminating in his choice of friends. But those same critics
might ponder some of the allies the United States has had over the
years.
   Panama's Manuel Noriega was considered a strategic ally until
the United States turned its back on him three years ago. Before
that, there were a host of military presidents in Latin America who
enjoyed U.S. confidence and generosity. In Africa, few leaders have
wielded a heavier hand than Zaire's Mobutu Sese Seko, a close U.S.
ally for years.
   In 1972, President Nixon embraced China at the time of the
Cultural Revolution, a period of extraordinary brutality in that
country. In the 1930's, Joseph Stalin was responsible for the
deaths of millions but that didn't stop President Franklin
Roosevelt from joining forces with him against the Nazis during
World War II.
   Basically, Mandela's defense is somewhat the same as that which
the United States has used in defending its selection of allies:
the enemy of my enemy is my friend.
   Columnist Charles Krauthammer sympathizes with Mandela's
position. ``One can hardly expect of a beleaguered people the
high-minded, clean-handed sifting of allies of a Sweden,''
Krauthammer wrote.
   The United States felt it could not afford to be choosy about
its allies in the life-or-death struggle against Hitler. Mandela
feels the same way about apartheid.
   ``Our attitude toward any country is determined by the attitude
of that country toward apartheid,'' Mandela said last week. He
feels a kinship for Yasser Arafat because the Palestine Liberation
Organization, like Mandela's African National Congress, ``is
fighting for the right of self-determination.''
   Those remarks have not gone unnoticed. Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla.,
has criticized Mandela for his support for the ``terrorist triad''
of Castro, Gadhafi and Arafat.
   Rep. Lawrence Smith, D-Fla., pointedly boycotted Mandela's
address Tuesday to a joint meeting of Congress. Others, like Sen.
Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, attended but withheld applause.
   The Washington Post editorialized that it was ``hardly noble''
of Mandela, given the articulate way he portrays human rights
conditions in his own country, to decline comment on the
``ruthless, even murderous places'' where the ANC has allies.
   On the question of use of force, President Bush said Monday,
with Mandela standing at his side, that a resort to violence to
resolve South Africa's problems is improper. Mandela replied that
he could not renounce violence if peaceful efforts fail.
   He drew criticism from some members of Congress but Rep. Howard
Wolpe, D-Mich., thinks Bush is applying a double standard to South
Africa in demanding an end to violence.
   ``Only in the case of South Africa has the doctrine of
nonviolence emerged as a central element of our policy,'' said
Wolpe, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Africa subcommittee.
   He said that in addition to invading Panama and bombing Libya,
the United States has armed resistance fighters on three
continents. In each case, the U.S. concluded that force was
necessary as a last resort, something Mandela can identify with.
   ``If we are forced to resort to violence,'' he told Bush Monday,
``it is because we have no alternative whatsoever.''

   Thirty-nine people were executed in the southern
city of Canton for crimes ranging from prostitution to murder, a
local newspaper reported.
   The Yangcheng Evening News said Wednesday the executions were
carried out immediately after the sentences were announced by local
courts.
   Nine people were executed for committing serious robberies, and
seven people were sentenced to death for murder, the newspaper
said. Those executed also included four people convicted of trading
in arms and ammunition, and two convicted of engaging in
prostitution, the paper said.
   Public Security Minister Wang Fang this month announced a new
campaign on crime, focusing on murder and other serious offenses.
Reports of arrests and executions have noticeably increased since
late May, including the executions earlier this week of 14 drug
traffickers.
   China launches anti-crime campaigns every few years, but without
discernibly slowing the nation's growing crime rate.
   Executions are carried out by a single gunshot to the back of
the head.

<HEAD>Negotiators Reach Agreement on Trade Deficit</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with Kaifu comment, details from the
accord.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By LARRY THORSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese and U.S. negotiators today reached an
agreement to help trim the $49 billion U.S. trade deficit with
Japan. They hailed the accord as an unprecedented step toward
easing tensions between the two partners.
   President Bush and Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu both issued
statements saying the pact would enhance their countries' global
partnership and also benefit other countries.
   ``I welcome and endorse this joint report,'' Bush said in
Washington, as talks concluded at the Foreign Ministry in Tokyo.
   Kaifu said Japan may find it painful to implement the report.
``However, these measures are intended to achieve a major reform of
the Japanese economy in the consumer's best interests,'' he said.
   Both leaders said that while Japan pledged in a 57-page report a
raft of measures to improve foreign companies' access to its
market, Washington had to reduce its budget deficit and improve the
competitiveness of U.S. industry.
   Kaifu praised Bush's willingness to consider tax revenue
increases as a deficit-reduction move. Bush commended Kaifu for
``his strong and courageous political leadership.''
   The negotiations ran through four grueling days, an extension
from the planned two days.
   There had been concern that this round in the so-called
Structural Impediments Initiative might have to be continued next
week to reach agreement.
   Linn Williams, the U.S. deputy trade representative, said:
   ``It is a remarkable thing that these two economies have done. I
see this as a kind of joint leadership. Japan and the United States
got together on difficult issues and worked together
constructively. We should be pleased with the efforts and results.''
   ``Particularly Prime Minister Kaifu and President Bush can be
proud. They have done something no two other countries have done
before,'' he added.
   Bush and Kaifu talked by telephone late Wednesday about Japan's
final increased offer to boost public works spending, a key area of
disagreement.
   Williams said the trade talks were ``an important influence'' on
Bush's tax move, which is aimed at reducing the federal budget
deficit. The deficit is regarded as a fundamental cause of the
trade imbalance, because it fuels U.S. demand for consumption and
imports from Japan. Raising U.S. tax revenues may thus reduce
Japanese exports and cut the trade imbalance.
   Bush's announcement was followed by a Japanese compromise
Wednesday to increase planned public works spending. That might
help reduce the trade imbalance by increasing sales of U.S.
products and construction services in Japan and soaking up some
excess Japanese savings and investment funds.
   While Bush risked political flak over taxes, the Japanese worry
about adding to inflation with a big increase in public works
spending.
   The final draft shows Japan agreed to $2.77 trillion in public
works spending over 10 years, up from $1.7 trillion in the 10 years
to 1990.
   Other measures on the Japanese side aimed at improving foreign
companies' access to the market include:
   _Submitting legislation by March to release more land for
housing and buildings and to curb high land prices.
   _Attaining clearance within 24 hours of imports by 1991.
   _Having the Fair Trade Commission take more formal action in
anti-monopoly cases instead of quiet persuasion. A bill is to go
before the current session of Parliament to raise fines to deter
cartels.
   _Having the commission increase its monitoring of transactions
with the business groups called ``keiretsu'' to deter
anti-competitive practices, publicize findings, enhance foreign
companies' ability to sell goods to companies in such groups.
   _Amending the criminal code to increase fines against
bid-rigging.
   _Using deregulation to speed the process for approving large
retail stores, widen liquor sales and open the distribution system.
   _Increasing the number of patent examiners and other measures to
shorten within five years the time to process patent applications
from the current 37 months to 24 months.
   _Surveying and publicizing differences between high Japanese
prices and foreign prices; having the government implement 52
measures that have been identified as likely to reduce such price
differentials.
   _Abolishing a law giving the government power to restrict direct
foreign investment if it could affect similar Japanese domestic
businesses.
   On the U.S. side, the federal budget deficit was the lead item,
and the report included the statement Bush made Tuesday accepting
``tax revenue increases'' _ a departure from his campaign promise
of ``Read my lips'' _ as a way to cut the deficit.
   Other American promises:
   _Urging Congress to pass a bill to create family savings
accounts and other measures to increase the low U.S. savings level.
   _Increasing federal funding for research and development.
   _Partially relaxing a ban on exports of California heavy crude
oil.
   _Creating more programs to promote exports.
   _Enacting measures to reach goals of excellence in education and
to improve the quality of the U.S. work force.

<TEXT>
   A strike to protest new taxes and to
demand the resignation of President Hussain Muhammad Ershad shut
down shops, businesses, transport and schools over most of the
country Thursday, news reports said.
   Most major towns, including the capital, were without public
transportation during the 12-hour work stoppage. Groups of
demonstrators paraded on the streets, United News of Bangladesh
said. Opposition leaders threatened more protests.
   ``We are planning a non-cooperation movement against Ershad,''
said Kamal Hossain, a leader of the Awami League party, one of the
organizers of the strike Thursday. ``No taxes to Ershad government.
That will be our next slogan.''
   The opposition claimed that 60 people were injured in police
attacks on protesters Thursday. Police officials, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said no one was injured. They said about
100 picketers were detained but were released when the strike was
over.
   Soon after the strike began at 6 a.m., Ershad left for Beijing
on a five-day state visit. United News said protesters threw stones
at the car of a government minister who had gone to see the
president off at the airport.
   Police chased away the demonstrators and the car escaped damage,
the news agency said.
   Ershad, a 59-year-old former army general, took power in a
bloodless coup in 1982. The opposition accuses him of rigging votes
to win subsequent presidential and parliamentary elections.
   An opposition movement to force Ershad's resignation gathered
strength in 1987 and early 1988 but dissipated amid differences
between the two major opposition parties _ the Awami League and the
Bangladesh Nationalist Party.
   But the government's announcement this month to raise taxes has
united the opposition again. Both major opposition parties said the
proposals were ``anti-people,'' and they jointly organized a
nationwide strike June 17.
   Thursday's strike went on as scheduled despite an announcement
by Ershad on Monday that he was slashing the tax proposals and
would not place any levies on kerosene oil, edible oil, soap and
salt.
   Opposition leaders said the cuts were not enough and demanded
dropping of all new taxes and Ershad's resignation.
   The annual per capita income of Bangladesh, one of the poorest
countries in the world, is about $168.

   A 9-year-old boy was pulled alive from the
rubble of his earthquake-flattened home where he was trapped for
nearly a week, the official news media said today.
   Also today, a legislator who died during relief efforts
following the deadly June 21 quake in northernwestern Iran was
given a hero's burial.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said the 9-year-old,
Morteza Amirpour, was found by Soviet rescuers late Wednesday next
to the bodies of family members in the ruins of the village of
Rahmatabad near Rudbar, 125 miles northwest of Tehran.
   It said the boy, who was in a coma, was taken to a provincial
hospital for treatment after being freed 162 hours after the quake.
The agency provided no other detail in its three-sentence report.
   IRNA said 15 aftershocks Wednesday and today jolted the stricken
northwestern provinces of Gilan and Zanjan, which bore the brunt of
the June 21 earthquake.
   Officials of the Red Crescent, the Iranian equivalent of the Red
Cross, said Wednesday that they have counted 40,000 dead and 60,000
injured. Government officials said earlier that 50,000 Iranians
were killed, 200,000 injured and 500,000 left homeless.
   Nearly 200 transports from 26 countries, including the United
States, have airlifted urgently needed supplies in since the
weekend, despite criticism of Western humanitarian aid by Iran's
isolationalist radicals.
   IRNA said Mohammad Hassan Eftekhari, a member of the 270-seat
Parliament who died in a helicopter crash Wednesday in the
northwest, was given a hero's burial in his hometown of Fouman in
northern Iran.
   Senior military and government officials attended a funeral
procession for him in Rasht, the agency reported.
   Four of the other 14 relief workers aboard the army's U.S.-built
CH-47 Chinook transport were critically injured when it crashed in
bad weather in the mountainous Kelishom region in the southern
sector of the quake zone.
   Eftekhari had ``constantly supervised the relief operations''
since the earthquake struck, IRNA reported.
   The Geophysics Center at Tehran University said the strongest of
the latest aftershocks measured 4.8 on the Richter Scale. The
killer quake registered between 7.3 and 7.7 on the scale, which is
a gauge of the energy released by an earthquake. There have been
more than 400 aftershocks in the devastated region in the last
week, adding to the chaos and misery.
   IRNA quoted an unidentified senior official at the Tehran center
as saying the tectonic fault that caused the deadly quake was
``gradually stabilizing.''
   That was welcome news for the thousands of Iranian and foreign
rescue workers who have been clawing through the rubble of 342
flattened towns and villages in the rugged region.
   The aftershocks have blocked roads, halting truck convoys
carrying tents, blankets, medicine and food into the pulverized
provinces.
   IRNA said one of the latest temblors caused landslides blocked a
key road between the devastated city of Rasht on the Caspian Sea
and Rudbar to the southwest for the second time in a week.
   ``Efforts are under way to clear the road,'' the agency reported.
   Relief officials in the stricken region northwest of Tehran said
that with hope running out of still finding survivors trapped in
the rubble, the relief operation is concentrating more on taking
care of the living.
   IRNA and official Tehran Radio reported another 20 aircraft
carrying hundreds of tons of aid in an international relief
operation have landed at Tehran's Mehrabad airport in the last 24
hours.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Thursday by the Supreme Court.
   
   DEATH PENALTY
   
   A day after it upheld Arizona's death penalty law, the court let
stand a ruling that had the effect of overturning most existing
death sentences in Arizona, Idaho and Montana.
   By a 4-3 vote, the justices refused to reinstate the death
sentence of John Harvey Adamson, convicted of murdering newspaper
reporter Don Bolles in 1976.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals previously had struck down
Adamson's death sentence. But the justices Wednesday upheld
Arizona's death penalty law in a decision directly conflicting with
the 9th Circuit court's ruling in Adamson's case.
   In throwing out Adamson's sentence, the appeals court struck
down a key provision of Arizona's death penalty law _ one which was
declared valid by the Supreme Court on Wednesday.
   Idaho and Montana have the same provisions in their death
penalty laws. They allow judges, rather than juries, to impose the
death sentence.
   The case is Lewis vs. Adamson, 88-1553.
   
   FAT STUDENT
   
   The court agreed to study the appeal of a Rhode Island college
ordered to pay nearly $44,000 to a former nursing student kicked
out because she was too fat.
   The justices said they will review one aspect of the case in
which Salve Regina College in Newport, R.I., was ordered to pay the
award to Sharon L. Russell.
   The case is Salve Regina College vs. Russell, 89-1629.
   
   TAWANA BRAWLEY
   
   The court refused to block an investigation into alleged
misconduct by a lawyer who represented Tawana Brawley, the black
New York teen-ager who said she was the victim of a racially
motivated assault.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by C. Vernon
Mason, who says the investigation is a form of illegal harassment.
   The case is Mason vs. Department Disciplinary Committee, 89-1752.
   
   HYPNOSIS
   
   The court agreed to consider reviving a lawsuit against an
Indiana prosecutor who advised police to hypnotize a woman
suspected of shooting her children.
   The court said it will review a ruling that the prosecutor is
immune from being sued for such conduct.
   The case is Burns vs. Reed, 89-1715.

   Since he was 8 years old, Al Getler
has wanted to spend his spare time with dummies.
   He is 29 now, and doing just that. Getler is a part-time
ventriloquist who is chairing that 16th-annual International
Ventriloquists Convention, a three-day event that began Thursday in
this northern Kentucky city.
   Getler, 29, of Mullica Hill, N.J., works as a full-time
newspaper circulation manager in Atlantic City. But ventriloquism _
which he does part-time _ is his first love.
   ``During the week, I wear a tie, I'm in the office, I do all the
mundane things managers do. On the weekends, I'm on my own. I grab
my dolls and go to work,'' he said in an interview at the
convention hotel.
   Getler brought his family _ his 6-year-old daughter has taken up
ventriloquism _ and his three dummies with him. He had these
exchanges with one of his dummies, named Floyd L. Smith:
   Dummy: ``I like girls and fast cars. Or, fast girls and cars.''
   Getler: ``How old are you?''
   Dummy (leaning over to show the top of his wooden head): ``Count
my rings.''
   Getler said the dummy affords a socially acceptable way to
deliver sharp verbal jabs to spectators.
   ``Floyd's my outlet,'' he said.
   Getler said he is a self-taught ventriloquist, drawn to the art
by curiosity after watching ventriloquist Paul Winchell on
television. He got his first dummy for Christmas when he was 8, and
taught himself in front of a mirror.
   The convention is sponsored by the Vent Haven Museum,
established by the late William Shakespeare Berger, a businessman
and amateur ventriloquist. Berger died in 1972 and what had been
his private collection of dummies and ventriloquism memorabilia
opened to the public in 1973.

   The University of Minnesota has ordered its
all-female dance line to stop performing at men's sports events,
saying the high-kicking dancers don't represent the image of women
the university wants to promote.
   ``I believe that an all-women's dance line at a men's athletic
event which is predominantly dominated by men sends all the wrong
signals and has all the wrong connotations,'' Rick Heydinger,
university vice president for external relations, said Wednesday.
   Dance line coach Andrea Lilleberg said the dancers feel they
have been discriminated against.
   ``Heydinger has taken it upon himself to decide what is best for
women in general. Part of women's rights is the right to choose
what organization you want to be affiliated with,'' she said.
   Without sponsorship and financial backing, the 16-member dance
line will become a university club left to raise its own funding.

<HEAD>CIA Reports Lower Pay, Layoffs Hit China's Stability</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Layoffs and lower pay for workers have
undermined social stability in China after last year's military
march into Tiananmen Square, the CIA told Congress on Thursday.
   The agency predicted that part of a 15 percent increase in
Chinese military spending will go to raise pay and bolster troop
morale after several years of inflation running over 10 percent.
When inflation is taken into account, it will be the first increase
in military spending in six years.
   ``A significant portion ... probably will also go to purchase
new equipment, such as riot-control gear for military
rapid-reaction units, and repaying the operational costs incurred
by the military in enforcing martial law in Beijing and Lhasa
during 1989,'' the report said.
   It gave a dark view of China's situation.
   ``Growing unemployment _ which has reached its highest level in
a decade _ and falling urban living standards are undermining
Beijing's efforts to reestablish the country's social stability,
which remains tenuous a year following the government's suppression
of the pro-democracy demonstrations,'' it said.
   The CIA report was given to the Joint Economic Committee.
   It quoted a Hong Kong press report, not further identified, as
saying that there had been more than 600 cases of worker unrest in
China in the last half of 1989. These included strikes, slowdowns,
demonstrations and rallies.
   ``According to many accounts, layoffs have created an embittered
and volatile class of unemployed workers,'' it went on.
   The report estimated that 60 million to 80 million workers have
no regular jobs but move from place to place.
   Sen. Jeff Bingaman, who presided at the hearing, said that if
the CIA assessment is correct, China's economy is in cold storage.
   ``The reform movement has been frozen partway between central
planning and a free market,'' the New Mexico Democrat added.
   The CIA said that China's national income grew less than 4
percent last year, compared with growth of about 12 percent a year
earlier. In the first five months of 1990, China's industry was
increasing production at a rate of less than 2 percent annually.
   The government's budget deficit grew to a record 8 billion
dollars, though it is small compared with the deficit of many other
countries.
   Prospects are dim for China to return to an all-out move toward
a market economy, the report said. That is the direction being
taken by eastern European countries formerly under communist rule.

   Mario Cuomo is promoting a bailout tax on the
rich, Doug Wilder is calling for an inquiry, Lloyd Bentsen is
lecturing on greed and Bob Kerrey is pounding at misplaced
priorities.
   It's only 1990, but Democrats are seizing on the savings and
loan mess _ that $200-billion-plus taxpayer nightmare _ as a chance
to revive their party and help them win the White House in 1992.
   ``This is going to play to the most damaging Republican
dimensions that they side with business and the rich,'' predicts
Harrison Hickman, a Democratic polling consultant.
   Republicans, too, are out to score political points by blaming
the Democrats.
   ``They're (Democrats) not going to sweep across that field
without a lot of casualties,'' GOP strategist Kevin Phillips said.
   Hardly anyone disputes that Democrats and Republicans alike set
in motion the 1980s deregulation process that ultimately led to the
collapse of the S&amp;L industry.
   Democrats as well as Republicans took money from S&amp;L operators
and lobbied federal regulators on their behalf. In fact, four of
five senators under investigation in connection with such
activities are Democrats.
   But the Democrats, prompted in part by Phillips' own new
critique of government-fostered ``greed and glitz'' during the
Reagan years, are aggressively defining the S&amp;L debacle early and
in their own terms.
   Depict the scandal as a symbol of 1980s greed and excess, the
party is telling its candidates and operatives. Call for a return
to economic policies that don't favor the rich. Question President
Bush's priorities and his management of the S&amp;L bailout.
   Democratic National Chairman Ron Brown is expected to outline an
S&amp;L campaign strategy Friday at a meeting of state party chairmen.
But the new theme already is a staple on the political circuit and
a refrain in some congressional races that could be dress
rehearsals for the 1992 presidential race.
   It's unclear whether the party will try to blame the S&amp;L bailout
for Bush's acknowledgment this week that tax increases are needed.
But at least one challenger lost no time in doing so.
   ``One of the reasons Bush is going to renege on his promise not
to raise taxes is the cost of the S&amp;L bailout,'' California
Democrat Calvin Dooley said Wednesday. He said he intends to tell
voters that Rep. Charles Pashayan, his opponent, ``is one person
that people can hold accountable.''
   Pashayan and Rep. Denny Smith of Oregon are two Republicans with
S&amp;L problems. Democratic Reps. Frank Annunzio of Illinois and Doug
Barnard of Georgia have similar woes.
   Campaign contributions from S&amp;L operators are among the
thrift-related issues at stake in the Annunzio, Barnard and
Pashayan races. Smith is taking heat for seeking regulatory favors
for a failing S&amp;L while he served on its board.
   Annunzio chairs a banking subcommittee that the GOP says did
nothing to avert the crisis. Annunzio contends the Republicans are
merely upset by his criticism of Neil Bush, the president's son,
who is being investigated for his role in the $1 billion Silverado
thrift failure in Colorado.
   The Democratic assault led White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater to launch a counterattack last week. ``There are a lot of
battles that can be fought on this turf, and we're ready,''
Fitzwater said, contending that ``the Democrats have a big role''
in the collapse.
   Among those Fitzwater singled out was Nebraska Sen. Kerrey,
mentioned often as a 1992 prospect. Kerrey is credited with coining
the phrase ``savings and loan president'' in a cutting reference to
Bush's spending priorities and his 1988 campaign pledge to be the
education president.
   Along with Jesse Jackson, Kerrey was a pioneer in aggressive S&amp;L
rhetoric. But they're no longer alone.
   New York Gov. Cuomo, another potential presidential candidate,
neatly packaged most of the Democratic themes this week in a
proposal for ``a tax on the richest people in the country,
presumably the kind of people who are involved in savings and
loans,'' to finance the bailout and ease the future burden on ``our
children.''
   Texas Sen. Bentsen, the 1988 vice presidential candidate, blames
the scandal not on deregulation but what party officials like to
call ``de-supervision.''
   ``In 1981 we had 54 S&amp;L regulators in Texas. In 1985 we had
12,'' Bentsen told his state party this month. ``The Republicans
looked for easy, short-term savings and they ended up stiffing the
American taxpayer with a bill for greed and mismanagement that
could reach half a trillion dollars.''
   Virginia Gov. Wilder, testing the waters in Iowa and New
Hampshire this month, called the S&amp;L mess ``the worst scandal in
our country's history'' and has told Bush that an independent
inquiry is needed.
   When the president recently made a show of adding money to step
up S&amp;L prosecutions, Wilder retorted, ``You mean you just found out
about it today?''

   Another cold war has ended _ not with a bang but a
sniffle.
   The Common Cold Research Center is closing Saturday, having
conceded defeat after 44 years in which thousands of noses were
bombarded with viruses in the quest for a cure for the common cold.
   Administrator Arthur Amos insists that the 18,000 volunteers who
passed through the hospital near Salisbury, 80 miles west of
London, did not suffer in vain.
   ``Going back in time, we used to think there was only one cold
virus. Now we know there are nearly 200, so there is no chance of
finding a vaccine,'' Amos said. ``We've been trying to find a
compound that acts on a family of viruses, but we've had no luck.''
   Some of the center's discoveries cannot be explained, Amos said.
Why, for example, did one-third of volunteers never show any signs
of a cold while the others, exposed to the same virus, coughed,
sneezed and felt miserable.
   ``Blood tests at the beginning of the trial and at the end often
show changes in antibody levels, which means even if it didn't seem
like they have a cold, they have a subclinical cold,'' Amos said.
   The volunteers received no medication, Amos said, unless they
were in extreme discomfort, in which case they got aspirin.
   The research center was housed in the Harvard Hospital, so named
because it was sent to Britain by the Harvard Medical School in
1940.
   During World War II, it was an American military field hospital,
and in 1946 it was turned over to the common cold project.
   The volunteers, who learned of the project through newspaper
advertisements and word-of-mouth, ranged in age from 18 to 50, and
some were repeat participants. One couple met there and returned
the following year for their honeymoon. One man went through the
10-day quarantined program 26 times, but Amos said he was ``a
rather odd sort of person.''
   Many participants came to vacation at the center, nestled in
rolling countryside in the shadow of the 404-foot spire atop
Salisbury Cathedral, England's highest spire.
   Two or three volunteers shared each of the center's 12
apartments.
   ``We usually have a flat empty in reserve in case they're
imcompatible... but in the main they usually get along,'' Amos said.
   The volunteers were barred from Salisbury and neighboring
villages and had to keep at least 30 feet away from anyone but
their roommates or the gowned, masked medical staff.
   ``If they were on a walk and couldn't avoid meeting someone,
they were told to put a paper tissue over their nose and walk by
quick,'' said Amos.
   Most volunteers came out of curiosity, Amos said, not for the
money, a paltry daily sum of pocket money now set at $3.
   ``There was also a certain feeling that they were working to
help medical research _ that voluntary spirit,'' he said. ``It's
pretty here and very quiet. If you live in the rougher spots of
Liverpool or London, this is the total opposite.''
   Amos, who has had only one cold in his six years at the center,
will work for three more months overseeing its closure.
   The Medical Research Council, which had provided the center's $1
million in annual funding, decided the unit would close after
director David Tyrell retired.
   ``It was so much his work, that it was not really viable without
him,'' a council spokeswoman said.

   Prince Charles broke his arm
Thursday in a polo accident when he fell from his horse, police
said.
   Buckingham Palace confirmed the 41-year-old prince had broken
his right arm and was being treated in a hospital.
   The accident occurred during a match at Cirencester Park,
Gloucestershire. It is seven miles from Highgrove, the country home
of Charles and his wife, Diana, and 70 miles west of London. The
princess was in London.
   Charles was playing for his team, Windsor Park, when he fell
from his horse 30 minutes into play.
   ``The prince slipped off his horse. He has got a nasty break
above the right elbow,'' said police Chief Inspector Colin Handy.
   A spokesman for Charles said the prince was in the process of
making a shot when he lost his balance.
   ``His horse just trotted away,'' the spokesman said, denying a
report that a horse had fallen on Charles. ``There was no contact
with any other horse or player.''
   The prince was taken to Cirencester Memorial Hospital.
   ``It looked like he was in a fair bit of pain when he got out of
the ambulance,'' said Handy,
   Charles was in the emergency department, where several other
patients were also awaiting treament. He was ``in very good spirits
and chatting with staff and cracking jokes with other patients,''
said Handy.

<HEAD>Politician Says Settlements Will Be Expanded</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM RON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading right-wing politician said Thursday
that Israel intends to expand Jewish settlements in the occupied
territories, despite U.S. warnings that this could jeopardize
American aid to Israel.
   ``We will expand settlements whenever and wherever we can,''
said Geula Cohen, deputy science minister and a leader of the
right-wing Tehiya Party. ``We don't have to cave in to U.S.
pressure.''
   Ms. Cohen refused to confirm reports that there was an unwritten
agreement between her party and the dominant Likud bloc specifying
construction of 5,000 new units each year in the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
   The Hebrew daily Haaretz reported that a pact between Likud and
its right-wing coalition partners stipulates that 5,000 new housing
units will be constructed each year in existing settlements.
   The newspaper said the right-wing parties had agreed to expand
existing settlements instead of building new ones as a tactical
move to try to avoid U.S. criticism.
   The Haaretz report calculated that by the end of the Likud
government's term in 2{ years, the number of Jewish settlers in the
occupied lands would exceed 120,000. There currently are at least
75,000 Jewish settlers living in 130 settlements in the occupied
territories, the government has said.
   Even the current estimate of settlers may be low, Haaretz said.
The newspaper said its own survey found 84,000 settlers living in
the West Bank and 4,000 in Gaza.
   Haaretz also said that 1,050 new housing units are under
construction and could house 6,800 more settlers when they are
completed this fall.
   The territories, which are home to 1.7 million Palestinians,
were captured by Israel from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle
East war. The United States opposes settling Soviet Jewish
immigrants in the territories, saying it is an obstacle to making
peace with the Palestinians.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's spokesman Avi Pazner dismissed
the newspaper report as ``pure speculation'' but said: ``It's
obvious that nobody has sought to put limits on existing
settlements.''
   The statements came a day after U.S. Rep. David Obey, chairman
of the House Appropriations' subcommittee on foreign operations,
warned that he would support cutting Israel's annual $3 billion in
foreign aid if it persists in expanding the settlements.
   Shamir formed a narrow, right-wing government earlier this month
after a coalition with the left-leaning Labor Party collapsed over
how to proceed with Middle East peace efforts.
   Likud's partners in the new coalition include three ultra-right
nationalist factions _ Tehiya, Tsomet and Moledet _ that are
committed to expanding Jewish presence in the territories.
   Benny Katzover, a West Bank settlement leader, said there were
plans for ``thickening'' existing settlements, but he would not say
how many new units might be built.
   ``Construction is going on all the time, and it will continue,''
he said. ``We are relying on Sharon,'' he added, referring to
Housing Minister Ariel Sharon. Sharon is an ardent supporter of the
settlement movement, and he created a fresh stir Thursday by
proposing ``emergency regulations'' to speed construction of
housing for Soviet immigrants.
   The regulations sought by Sharon would allow his ministry to
seize private land for construction, possibly bypassing laws
protecting archaeological sites and nature reserves, critics said.
   Settlements have come under heavy scrutiny in recent months
because of Arab criticism over Israel's policy of allowing some
Soviet Jewish immigrants to move to the occupied territories.
   The Arabs fear Palestinians may be displaced and that their
efforts to form an independent state will be undermined.
   Israel says that only only a fraction of the more than 52,000
Soviet Jews who have come here in the last year have moved to the
occupied lands. It is seeking $400 million in loan guarantees from
the United States to help house the Soviet immigrants.

   A bit of aviation history was made in this
city where Charles Lindbergh learned to fly.
   Twenty corporate aircraft, half of them the popular Learjets,
were put on the auction block Wednesday in a first-of-its-kind
event for the aircraft industry.
   ``This has never been done before in aviation, save for an
occasional bankruptcy sale and sales of smaller or antique
planes,'' said J. Robert Duncan, president of Duncan Aviation.
   The sale was also a first for Sotheby's, the international
auction house that specializes in fine art and antiques. John L.
Marion, the head of Sotheby's North American operations, wielded
the gavel.
   Within an hour, Duncan crews wheeled the aircraft, one-by-one,
through a clean aircraft hangar. There, Marion bellowed the
auctioneer's mantra: ``I have $2 million to start, I have 2
million.''
   When it was over, five airplanes had been sold for a total of
$7,927,750. Two others, including the most expensive one offered,
were snapped up before the sale, bringing the total to more than
$20 million, Marion said.
   Duncan, who heads the 30-year-old business aviation sales and
service with 550 employees in 14 cities, said he was pleased with
the sale, but had greater expectations.
   ``We'll analyze the results and evaluate whether or not we want
to make this an annual event. I think we might have another sale,''
he said.
   Prices paid ranged from $309,750 for a 1980 Piper Cheyenne I to
``about $14 million to $15 million'' for a 1988 Canadair Challenger
_ one of the two sold before the auction, Duncan said.
   Gary Conklin, a representative of Great Planes Sales Inc. of
Tulsa, Okla., picked up a Westwind 1124 for $2.1 million. He said
his company buys planes, renovates them and then looks for a buyer.
   The names of other buyers were not made public.
   Lindbergh studied flying at the old Lincoln School of Aviation
in the 1920s. He made his solo flight of the Atlantic in May 1927.

   Eighty years ago, 9-year-old Helen Hayes made
her Broadway debut. This week, the grande dame of American
actresses celebrated the rebirth of a theater on a very different
Broadway _ in this Hudson River town.
   Hayes welcomed friends to a twilight fete Wednesday at her
Victorian river mansion 30 miles north of the Great White Way.
   She told more than 100 friends, including actors Douglas
Fairbanks Jr., Colleen Dewhurst and Jose Ferrer, about what she
calls the ``little theater'' that will be her 90th birthday gift in
October. It's a turn-of-the-century silent movie house that's being
renovated into a $5 million arts center in her name.
   ``This theater was born the same year I was, and I think it will
outlive me,'' said Hayes.
   The playhouse, where actors from Liza Minnelli to Tallulah
Bankhead have appeared, was saved from the wrecking ball after a
1970 fire.
   To see it, Hayes' friends sailed up the Hudson from Manhattan _
not in a ``kayak to Nyack,'' as Cole Porter would have it _ but in
a 142-foot yacht.
   Then they boarded buses that took them past the brick playhouse
on South Broadway, wrapped in a huge red ribbon, to Pretty Penny,
her home on North Broadway.
   ``They came to see me, my little theater, and my roses'' _ all
200 bushes of them, said Hayes, who chatted with philanthropists
Laurance Rockefeller and Brooke Astor, actress Arlene Dahl and
actor Tony Randall.
   The actress strolled through the rose garden first planted in
1933 when she and her husband, the late playwright Charles
MacArthur, moved into the 21-room house.
   Hayes had met the playwright at a Manhattan soiree at the end of
which he put peanuts in the palm of her hand and said, ``I wish
they were emeralds.''
   At sunset on Wednesday, the Nyack garden became a stage for the
chatter of actors and producers who along with Hayes have defined
American theater.
   ``This lady of the theater has been there and back, she has seen
it all,'' said Dewhurst. ``You can't believe her energy _ she's a
natural survivor, with a very strong spiritual side.''
   The 500-seat Helen Hayes-Tappan Zee Performing Arts Center, to
open in 1991, is to offer theater, children's events, music and
film.
   The new playhouse will get the children ``off the streets and
away from movies about murder and mayhem,'' Hayes said.
   So far, more than $1 million has been raised.
   ``The blasted expenses, it's a struggle and you lose money, but
the people want to go to the theater,'' she said.

   Seven Americans have a chance to become
one of the wonders of the international ballet world.
   They are among 27 finalists dancing toward that dream in the
third round of the International Ballet Competition.
   The international jury will anounce prize winners in four
divisions on Friday. Winners will receive gold, silver and bronze
medals and cash awards from $500 to $10,000.
   The U.S. finalists are three senior women, three junior women
and one senior man.
   ``I feel great, knowing I represent the U.S. male population,''
Mark Arvin. ``But still, it's a real tough competition with the
Cuban, the Russians and the guy from Argentina. I expect them to
capture a lot of medals.''
   But Arvin's favorite fact is that his partner, U.S. senior
Martha Butler, also made it to the finals. ``There are only three
couples still intact'' since the first round, Arvin said. ``That's
an achievement.''
   ``I'm thrilled,'' said Butler, 23. ``I feel so fortunate.''
   ``It's been tough, but a different kind of tough _ not like
anything I've known before,'' she said of the competition.
``There's a lot of pressure.''
   The United States had 36 competitors in the competition.
   In addition to Arvin and Butler, both with the Houston Ballet,
the other U.S. finalists are: Lauren Anderson, 25, of the Houston
Ballet; Yan Chen, 20, an apprentice with the Washington Ballet;
Elizabeth Gaither, 16, of the Houston Ballet; Lauren Gelfand, 15,
of Cambridge, Mass.; and Diane Perez, 15, who dances with the
Ballet Concierto de Puerto Rico.

   The Supreme Court on Thursday agreed to decide
what power federal judges have to impose prison sentences stiffer
than those called for by new guidelines.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by a former federal
employee convicted of embezzling-related charges who said he was
not given fair warning that the judge intended to exceed the
guidelines.
   The new sentencing guidelines took effect in 1987, culminating a
decade-long effort to overhaul the old system that many said
created unjustified sentencing disparities. The new rules were
drawn up by a seven-member commission appointed by Congress.
   The guidelines remain controversial, with many defendants and
some judges saying they improperly curb judicial discretion and
give prosecutors too much power.
   The justices are expected to announce a decision in the case
next year.
   The defendant, William J. Burns, was sentenced to five years in
prison although he pleaded guilty with the understanding the
maximum penalty would be 37 months.
   Burns was charged with embezzling $1.2 million in government
funds from 1982 to 1988 while he was a financial supervisor with
the Agency for International Development. He also was convicted of
tax evasion for failing to pay $475,685 in taxes on the money
prosecutors said he stole.
   Prosecutors said Burns diverted AID travel funds into a bank
account in the fictitious name of Vincent Kaufman and later claimed
the money was in payment for phony furniture moving expenses.
   Authorities said they discovered the embezzlement when a routine
security check revealed that Burns, whose annual salary was $35,000
a year, owned a $400,000 house.
   He pleaded guilty under an agreement with federal prosecutors
that called for him to be sentenced under new guidelines that set a
maximum of 37 months in prison for such crimes.
   But U.S. District Judge Norma Johnson imposed the stiffer
sentence without having informed him in advance that she was
considering the harsher penalty.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington upheld the
sentence in January.
   The appeals court said the guidelines permit judges to impose
stiffer or milder sentences if there are special aggravating or
mitigating circumstances.
   ``The trial court is best situated to decide the length of the
sentence and its finding should not be reversed unless it is
arbitrary or capricious,'' the appeals court said.
   The appeals court also rejected Burns's claim that he was, in
effect, blindsided because he was not given an adequate opportunity
by the judge to challenge her plans to depart from the guidelines.
   The appeals court said, ``Since the defendant had an opportunity
to address the court before sentencing ... and has a right to
appeal his sentence, he has not been harmed by the trial court's
lack of notice.''
   Unless Congress amends the guidelines, the appeals court said,
the rules do not require the judge to warn defendants in advance
that sentences may exceed the guidelines.
   The Justice Department urged the Supreme Court to reject Burns's
appeal.
   The high court ruled last year that the guidelines do not
violate constitutionally required separation of powers between the
three branches of government. The justices did not decide whether
the new system may violate the rights of defendants.
   The case acted on Thursday is Burns vs. U.S., 89-7260.

   Four months after the Supreme Court eased the
rules on welfare benefits for disabled children, the government
can't agree with the plaintiffs on who may be owed money or the
best way to find them.
   The dispute has delayed the process of trying to locate hundreds
of thousands of poor children who the court said were wrongly
denied Supplemental Security Income benefits.
   The decision gave the children the right to have their cases
reviewed. Total back benefits are expected to reach from $1 billion
to $2 billion.
   But the government has not yet paid a dime. The Social Security
Administration has been arguing with the children's attorneys over
many facets of the case, including lawyers' fees and how many cases
should be included.
   Children's lawyers estimate more than 600,000 denials need to
re-evaluated. The government says about 280,000 children are
affected.
   ``Frankly, in over 20 years of litigating similar cases, we
cannot recall a single case in which government counsel were more
obstructive or belligerent,'' Philadelphia attorney Jonathan M.
Stein said in a June 18 letter to the Justice Department.
   ``It's unfortunate,'' Deputy SSA Commissioner Louis Enoff said
in an interview. ``We wanted to make every effort to move quickly
to reach every child that is potentially eligible. I still would
like to do that.''
   Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., said he fears the government could be
inadvertently destroying case files from the 1980s and 1970s
necessary for children to prove they deserve benefits.
   But SSA said system-wide computer safeguards prevented that. ``I
don't mean to tell you that somewhere in the past there may not
have been a file destroyed,'' Enoff said. ``Sometimes a folder gets
lost or destroyed accidentally. But we have developed a class
action tracking system.''
   More than 290,000 poor, disabled children receive SSI benefits,
which vary from state to state and range from $386 to about $700 a
month.
   By a 7-2 vote on Feb. 20, the Supreme Court voided a government
regulation that gave children seeking the benefits less protection
than adults. The Department of Health and Human Services rule had
applied a rigid list of disorders to children, while permitting
adults to be judged individually on their ability to work.
   Stein, the children's attorney in the class-action lawsuit, said
the decision should force officials to re-evaluate 600,000 denials
going back to 1974, when the regulation was enacted.
   But the Social Security Administration says legal precedent
requires that they only go back to 1983, when the case was
originally filed on behalf of Brian Zebley, then 5, of Upland, Pa.
   Brian, who suffers from congenital brain damage, lost his SSI
benefits when an administrative law judge concluded that his
medical conditions did not meet government requirements. There have
been about 280,000 denials since then that now should be reviewed,
according to SSA.
   Both sides have indicated a willingness to compromise on how
many reviews should be undertaken. The administration accuses Stein
of delaying negotiations by unreasonably seeking $6 million in
legal and other fees in the case.
   ``Most regrettably, your compensation demands have precluded a
settlement which not only would have brought an end to this
longstanding litigation but, most importantly, would have been very
fair and equitable to members of the `Zebley' class,'' Stuart Licht
of the Justice Department's Civil Division said in a June 8 letter
to Stein.
   ``It's a total lie,'' said Stein. He said he has sought $1.2
million for work done between 1983 and the court decision, plus
unspecified fees for the past four months.

<HEAD>Researchers Say Riflemen Could Disable City Power Supplies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Terrorists could knock out electrical power to
an American city by using store-bought rifles on carefully chosen
targets, congressional researchers said Thursday.
   Armed with high-powered rifles available from any gun store and
some basic engineering knowledge, terrorists could wreak havoc
without having to get past a single guard at generating plants,
Robin Roy of the congressional Office of Technology Assessment told
the Senate Government Affairs Committee.
   ``Two or three knowledgeable individuals using only readily
available, off-the-shelf supplies could destroy enough facilities
to cause a short-term blackout over a metropolitan area, followed
by months of reduced reliability and rotating power outages during
peak periods,'' Roy told the panel, which is investigating the
vulnerability of power plants to terrorists, hurricanes and
earthquakes.
   When asked what he meant by ``readily available,
off-the-shelf,'' Roy said, ``Rifles ... if you know what to shoot
at.''
   Alan Taft Crane of the OTA testified that transmission lines are
vulnerable to rifle fire. ``Such damage can be repaired quickly,
but the saboteur can repeat it even more quickly,'' he said. ``Many
such quick attacks would have much the same effect on the system as
eliminating key facilities.''
   Blackouts can causes millions of dollars in damage to utilities
and public services, not to mention lost business and looting, the
report noted. A 1977 blackout in New York City and neighboring
Westchester County lasted a full day and caused losses of nearly
$350 million.
   Although power systems can usually withstand hurricanes, ``the
lingering, local blackouts following Hurricane Hugo demonstrated
that more advance preparation may be warranted,'' Crane said.
   ``Facilities can be designed to withstand earthquakes, as they
are in California, but less prepared areas including the Central
Mississippi valley, the southern Appalachians and the Indiana
region are also vulnerable to major shocks,'' Crane said.
   The OTA report also noted economic roadblocks to recovery from
serious disasters, growing foreign control of the electrical
equipment manufacturing industry and decreasing investment by power
companies in backup capacity.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Blocks Execution After Upholding Law Behind It</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court permanently blocked the
execution of an Arizona killer Thursday, a day after upholding the
death penalty law under which he had been sentenced. One attorney
general called the sequence ``a complete fluke.''
   Two of the justices who voted with the majority in the 5-4
decision upholding the state law did not take part in Thursday's
action, turning Wednesday's dissenters into a 4-3 majority for the
one case.
   In a brief order, the justices refused to reinstate the death
sentence of John Harvey Adamson, convicted of murdering Phoenix
newspaper reporter Don Bolles in 1976.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 1988 threw out
Adamson's death sentence after striking down a provision in Arizona
law that lets judges, instead of juries, choose between life and
death for convicted murderers.
   The appeals court's ruling called into doubt the validity of
death penalty laws in Idaho and Montana, which also allow for
sentencing by judges. But the Arizona provision was declared
constitutional Wednesday by the Supreme Court in the case of
another Arizona killer.
   Thursday's confusing turn of events came about because Justices
Sandra Day O'Connor, a former state judge in Arizona, and Anthony
M. Kennedy, a former 9th Circuit court judge, did not participate
in Adamson's case.
   That left only Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices
Byron R. White and Antonin Scalia voting to grant Arizona's appeal
and set aside the 9th Circuit court's ruling in the Adamson case.
   Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, Harry A.
Blackmun and John Paul Stevens, who voted Wednesday to strike down
Arizona's death penalty law, voted to deny Arizona's appeal.
   The net result: both the 1988 appeals court ruling and a
contradictory Supreme Court decision are on the books.
   The practical effect: Adamson cannot be sentenced to death.
   A surprised Arizona Attorney General Bob Corbin said, ``As we
see it, the Arizona death penalty statute is constitutional ... but
it doesn't apply to Adamson.''
   ``It's a crazy decision but that's what they voted,'' Corbin
said.
   Idaho Attorney General Jim Jones called the sequence of events
``ridiculous,'' but predicted that Thursday's action would affect
no death row inmate but Adamson.
   ``It really means not too much more than Adamson is going to get
off because of a complete fluke, and the work of the judges of the
9th Circuit court,'' Jones said.
   Prosecutors said Adamson was paid $100,000 to attach a bomb to
the car of Bolles, who had been investigating organized crime for
The Arizona Republic in Phoenix. Bolles died June 11, 1976, nine
days after his car exploded.
   Before dying, Bolles identified Adamson as the man who had made
an appointment to see him the day of the bombing.
   Adamson originally was allowed to plead guilty to second-degree
murder in exchange for his testimony against two others allegedly
involved in the murder plot.
   His testimony helped convict Max Dunlap, a building contractor,
and James Robison, a plumber.
   But the Arizona Supreme Court threw out the Dunlap and Robison
convictions in 1980 and ordered a new trial for them. The two have
not been retried.
   Adamson, who by 1980 was serving a 20-year prison term, said he
would not testify at a new trial unless the state met additional
conditions _ including his release and the government's help in
establishing a new identity.
   After Adamson's refusal to cooperate, state prosecutors filed
first-degree murder charges against him. He was tried, convicted
and sentenced to death.
   The 9th Circuit court threw out Adamson's death sentence in
1986, ruling he had been subjected to ``double jeopardy.'' The
Supreme Court reversed that ruling and reinstated the death
sentence by a 5-4 vote in 1987.
   The high court's 1989-90 term ended Wednesday as the justices
recessed until Oct. 1. But they left behind orders in various cases
that were released by the court clerk Thursday.
   In other orders, the court:
   _Agreed to study the appeal of a Rhode Island college ordered to
pay nearly $44,000 to a former nursing student kicked out because
she was too fat.
   _Refused to block an investigation into alleged misconduct by C.
Vernon Mason, a lawyer who represented Tawana Brawley, the black
New York teen-ager who said she was the victim of a racially
motivated assault.
   _Agreed to decide whether an Indiana woman may sue the
prosecutor she says violated her rights by advising police to
hypnotize her before asking questions about the shootings of her
children.

   U.S. and Japanese trade negotiators agreed Thursday
to drastic economic changes to help cut the $49 billion U.S. trade
deficit with Japan. Officials said the unprecedented pact would
improve the quality of life in both countries.
   In the wide-ranging accord, the United States agreed to raise
its tax revenues. Japan said it would spent $1 trillion more on
public works in the next decade. The two measures are aimed at
helping close the trade gap and easing trade friction.
   ``I welcome and endorse this joint report,'' President Bush said
in Washington as the talks ended at the Foreign Ministry in Tokyo.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu said that carrying out the reforms
would be painful. ``However, these measures are intended to achieve
a major reform of the Japanese economy in the consumers' best
interests,'' he said.
   Kaifu praised Bush's willingness to consider tax revenue
increases at the risk of a strong political backlash. Bush
commended Kaifu for ``his strong and courageous political
leadership.''
   Linn Williams, the U.S. deputy trade representative, called the
agreement, which followed telephone consultations between Bush and
Kaifu on Wednesday night, ``something no two other countries have
done before.''
   Williams said the talks were ``an important influence'' on
Bush's tax move, which is aimed at reducing the federal budget
deficit. The deficit is regarded as a fundamental cause of other
economic ills in the United States, including the trade imbalance.
   After four days of intensive talks, haggard but happy trade
officials emerged with the 57-page report that included Bush's
decision Wednesday to raise tax revenues _ a departure from his
campaign promise of no new taxes.
   The report also carried a pledge by Japan to spend $2.77
trillion over the next 10 years on public works projects to
stimulate demand for imports and help offset this nation's huge
reservoir of savings. Japan has spent $1.7 trillion in the past 10
years.
   The decision on public works represented a major compromise.
U.S. officials had sought a 10-year, $3.22 trillion package. But
Japanese officials resisted increasing their original offer of
$2.68 trillion because of fears of inflation.
   ``We think that plan, along with President Bush's plan, would go
a long way toward reducing the imbalance between Japan and the
United States,'' said John B. Taylor of the Council of Economic
Advisers.
   He said the reforms were expected to have a gradual but lasting
impact on Japan's trade surplus with the United States, which
totaled $49 billion last year.
   Earlier, officials said the results of the reforms were expected
to show up within two or three years.
   Many of the reforms are indirectly related to trade flows.
   The agreement also called for Japan to increase penalties for
violations of anti-monopoly laws, facilitate legal action against
unfair business practices and crack down on collusion and
bid-rigging. The measures are intended to make Japanese business
more open to foreign competition.
   Japan also promised new policies to slow real estate inflation
and encourage more efficient land use. The steps would help lower
the cost of doing business in Japan and improve the quality of life
for average Japanese, who cannot afford to buy new homes.
   Japan agreed to relax restrictions on retail sales to let in
more imports and open new business opportunities.
   In addition to stronger action on the budget deficit, Washington
pledged to urge Congress to enact laws on family savings accounts
and other measures to help increase U.S. savings and investment.
   The United States said it also would enact measures to improve
education and worker training as a long-term investment in the
quality of the U.S. work force. Washington also promised to develop
programs to promote exports while easing restrictions on oil
exports.
   Officials on both sides expressed satisfaction with the report
from the talks, formally known as the Structural Impediments
Initiative.
   ``We believe that this report is a historic document that
contains wide-ranging commitments and actions with significant
benefits for both economies,'' the U.S. delegation said in a
statement issued after the talks ended.
   Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama said the measures were needed to
improve Japanese living standards and ``ensure that relations
between the Japanese economy and the rest of the world economy are
less tense and more harmonious.''
   Some analysts have expressed doubts the fundamental reforms
envisioned would actually occur, particularly changes in ingrained
business habits that have long gone untouched by fair trade
regulators.
   Williams acknowledged the ``proof will be in what really
happens,'' but he said the U.S. delegation was optimistic.
   ``We believe their intentions are genuine,'' he said.

<HEAD>Abortion Ruling Expected to Generate New Efforts for Restrictions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHANIE NANO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   This week's U.S. Supreme Court abortion ruling already has
spurred new efforts in at least one state to make minors tell their
parents before getting an abortion.
   In rulings on Ohio and Minnesota laws, the high court said a
state may require a minor, unmarried girl to notify one or both
parents before having an abortion _ provided she has the option of
getting a judge's permission.
   On Thursday, a New Jersey lawmaker introduced a bill for
one-parent notification, and other states are expected to see a
wave of legislative proposals.
   ``I'm trying to bring back family relationships. Parents have to
assume responsibility for children,'' said state Sen. Francis
McManimon, the sponsor of the New Jersey bill.
   New Jersey had a one notification bill pending; the new one was
designed to conform with Monday's Supreme Court ruling. That
decision could spur enforcement of abortion restrictions for minors
in at least nine states.
   At least 23 states have laws that require a minor to obtain the
consent of one or both parents before having an abortion. Eleven
states have laws requiring a girl simply to notify one or both
parents. A judge's permission can be substituted in some states.
   But many of the laws haven't been enforced or have been blocked
by the courts, some awaiting the high court's ruling.
   ``These are going to spring to life. And I predict most of the
other states will place similar laws on the books,'' said Dr. John
Willke, president of the National Right to Life Committee in
Washington, D.C.
   A flood of abortion bills followed the Supreme Court's 1989
Webster ruling, which permitted greater state limits on abortion.
But few survived a backlash from abortion-rights advocates.
   About 350 bills have been considered in state legislatures since
Webster, said Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion
Rights Action League.
   ``We'll see that many and more than that in the coming year,''
she said. ``You're going to see efforts to go beyond parental
consent, parental notification. There will be further attempts to
undermine Roe.''
   The Supreme Court's 1973 decision in Roe vs. Wade established
the right to an abortion.
   Minnesota's notification law could be back in effect in 30 days,
said the state's chief deputy attorney general, Jack Tunheim. It
went into effect in 1981 but was ruled unconstitutional in 1986.
   Half the 7,200 teen-agers who got abortions during that time
sought a judge's permission and all but eight had their petitions
approved, according to Thomas Webber, executive director of Planned
Parenthood of Minnesota.
   Ohio's notification law was never enforced while appeals were
pending.
   Arkansas and West Virginia already enforce their notification
laws, and Utah requires parental notification ``if possible.''
   Appeals courts were waiting for the high court's decision before
ruling on consent or notification laws from Georgia, Kentucky and
Tennessee.
   The ruling also could revive laws in Illinois, Nebraska, Idaho,
Maryland, Mississippi and Nevada that were either blocked or
haven't been enforced.
   Abortion foes in Oregon have begun a petition drive to get a
notification measure on the November ballot. In Michigan, opponents
are collecting signatures to get a veto-proof bill into the
Legislature. Gov. James Blanchard vetoed a parental consent law
this year.
   An anti-abortion spokeswoman in Montana thinks the Supreme Court
ruling could pave the way for a notification law in that state.
   ``Given the Supreme Court decision, I think many more
legislators would be confident to vote for that,'' said Linda
Sargent, executive director of Montana Right to Life.
   But some Wisconsin lawmakers said the latest decision won't sway
legislators. A consent bill passed in the Assembly but died in a
Senate committee last year.
   ``I don't think these decisions will change attitudes or votes
on this important issue,'' said Senate Majority Leader Joseph
Strohl.

<TEXT>
   The peace, contentment and good will
in Renfro Valley have been shaken.
   The picturesque hollow that the late entertainer John Lair
described in his song ``The Valley Where Time Stands Still'' is now
the scene of a battle over rights to its name.
   Lair turned the valley 50 miles south of Lexington into an
entertainment center when he founded the Renfro Valley Barn Dance
in 1939. His song described the valley as a place of ``peace and
content and good will.''
   But that began to change last year when three investors bought
the 110-acre property that Lair had trademarked and copyrighted.
The new owners, Renfro Valley Folks Inc., plan to turn the complex
near Interstate 75 into a $35 million country-music theme park.
   The investors maintain that the purchase included the exclusive
use of the Renfro Valley name.
   Several business owners in the unincorporated hamlet of about 75
people balked when the new owners ordered them to stop using the
words ``Renfro Valley'' in store names and merchandise.
   ``When we bought John Lair's property, we also purchased the
country music, museum, restaurant, motel and records,'' said Ralph
Gabbard, president of Renfro Valley Folks.
   ``He had many federal trademarks and we filed for others. All
we're doing is what (Walt) Disney did before he went into Orlando
or California. What we're trying to do is protect the good name.''
   The Renfro Valley complex includes a new 1,530-seat auditorium,
the old Renfro Valley Barn Dance building, old jamboree building, a
recently completed turn-of-the-century crafts village, a restaurant
and motel and a country music museum.
   Valley business owners claim they have as much right to the
Renfro Valley name as Renfro Valley Folks.
   ``This valley will be 200 years old next year,'' said Ailene
Collinsworth, who owns Renfro Valley Country Store with her
husband, Willard. ``It's been called Renfro Valley all that time.
My family has lived in the valley for over 30 years.''
   The store has been selling cups, spoons, caps and hats
emblazoned with ``Renfro Valley'' for more than 15 years, she said.
   Renfro Valley Folks filed a lawsuit June 18 in U.S. District
Court in London, Ky., seeking to stop Renfro Valley Record Shop
from using the name.
   Store owner Joe Allen said he offered to compromise by dropping
``Renfro Valley'' in exchange for the right to sell records and
tapes from the entertainment company without paying royalties.
   An attorney for Renfro Valley Folks said Wednesday that an
agreement had been reached with Allen that would be signed Monday.
But that was news to Allen.
   ``I haven't heard a word from them,'' he said Thursday. ``They
want to license the products in my store. I don't have to ask them
what I can sell. It's my store, not theirs. I will never pay
royalties. They do not own my business.''
   Said Mrs. Collinsworth: ``We know they have the trademark on
Renfro Valley Folks. We don't want what belongs to them, but we
want what belongs to us. ... They want to trademark everything.
They want to keep us little folks from selling that, but that's our
living, too.''

   Foreign Minister David Levy was hospitalized
again on Thursday for treatment of a heart condition, officials at
Jerusalem's Hadassah Hospital said.
   Levy was released Tuesday from Haemek Hospital in the northern
Israeli town of Afula, where he spent 11 days after suffering a
minor heart attack.
   Dr. Shmuel Pinchas, Hadassah Hospital director, told the
national Itim news agency that Levy underwent treatment to expand
heart arteries and was feeling well. Levy is likely to be released
in the next few days, he said.
   Levy, 52, a member of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud
bloc, was housing minister before being appointed to his current
post in Shamir's new right-wing government. He also holds the post
of deputy prime minister.
   Levy is regarded as a possible successor to Shamir in Likud.

<TEXT>
   Raging wildfires set by arsonists
burned more than 300 homes in Southern California as wind-driven
flames left over 14,000 acres of parched brush blackened today.
   Forty-six firefighters were injured working fire lines
throughout the region, including two prison inmates critically
burned in Riverside County.
   A 3,500-acre blaze destroyed 280 homes in Santa Barbara County
late Wednesday and continued to burn today in a canyon north of
Santa Barbara.
   Homeowners in this coastal community today surveyed charred lots
where flames torched rows of expensive homes but skipped through
the air to spare others. One serious injury was reported.
   ``It was a beautiful neighborhood,'' Eric Lim said as the
remains of his house smoldered behind him.
   ``I can't find anything, there's nothing,'' Nancy Harvey said,
her hands picking through what was once the kitchen of her dream
home. ``I'm hoping to find my address book.''
   ``The fire is incredible. It came down from the mountains. It
spread everywhere. It burned everything in its path,'' said Tim
Grasey, spokesman for the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Department.
   From Santa Barbara to San Diego, thousands of people were
rousted from homes.
   Santa Barbara residents alerted by smoke, neighbors and roving
U.S. Forest Service crews packed what they could and fled in cars
or on foot.
   ``The trees were lighting up like torches,'' said resident Dave
Williams, who was just watching the fire until he realized that
``this is serious business. I could die in this stuff.''
   The fires were worsened by four years of drought and a searing
heat wave that pushed temperatures to record levels well above 100
degrees. Water reserves were at their lowest levels in years.
   Hot desert winds up to 60 mph fanned the Santa Barbara fire
Wednesday, U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Susan Mockenhaupt said.
   Dropping temperatures and winds tamed the fire overnight,
leaving only isolated hot spots. But fire officials refused to
declare it contained today, saying they feared winds could fan the
flames again.
   In one subdivision, every home was gutted, every street a
landscape of chimneys and charred kitchen appliances. Occasionally,
a geyser of flame shot from a gas main, giving the scene a hellish
look. Workers rushed to shut off gas lines.
   The fire also destroyed businesses and a school for handicapped
adults, set a fire station ablaze and prompted evacuation of the
county jail. It shut down traffic on U.S. Highway 101 and cut off
rail service.
   Authorities blamed arson, saying they found an incendiary
device. Ashes filled the sky more than 35 miles from the blaze.
   In Arizona, meanwhile, fire burned out of control today in Tonto
National Forest, where six firefighters were killed Tuesday. In
Montrose, Colo., a lightning-sparked fire in the ponderosa burned
at least 1,000 acres.
   Santa Barbara County's blaze was its first of that magnitude
since a 1977 fire burned 234 homes in the area, which is on the
Pacific Coast 100 miles northwest of Los Angeles. Its property
values were among the state's highest.
   ``It looks like a war zone out there,'' Grasey said.
``Everything is blackened. It's just total devastation. You never
felt more helpless. You look at it and there's nothing you could do
to stop it.''
   Brenda Rein watched from a shopping mall as the fire marched
down a mountain.
   ``The whole sky was just orange. I looked up and saw the moon
through the smoke, kind of a werewolf moon,'' she said.
   Barbara Jefferson of Santa Barbara came out of a movie theater
to find the evening sky raining soot and the wind blowing so
fiercely it was hard to stand. In the distant hills, she said, ``we
just saw mountains of flames.''
   Police in the Los Angeles suburb of Glendale today said they
were seeking two people for questioning in connection with a
deliberately set fire that destroyed or damaged 55 homes there
Wednesday. The homes were valued at $300,000 to $700,000 each, and
property losses were estimated at $30 million.
   ``The California chaparral over here, all that sage and scrub
oak, is literally like gasoline,'' Fire Battalion Chief Chris Gray
said.
   Meanwhile, 60 miles to the east of Los Angeles, a fire near the
small community of El Cerrito in Riverside County destroyed 12
homes and closed Interstate 15.
   Nine firefighters were injured, mostly from heat exhaustion and
smoke inhalation, officials said. An estimated 2,000 firefighters
were trying today to contain the fire at 2,200 acres.
   The blaze began after a U.S. Forest Service ``controlled burn''
_ an attempt to burn away brush to prevent fires _ raged out of
control.
   An arson blaze in the Carbon Canyon area of Orange County spread
over 6,640 acres to the San Bernardino County community of Sleepy
Hollow, where eight homes were engulfed. Eight firefighters
suffered minor injuries, authorities said.
   Sleepy Hollow's 2,000 residents fled, said LoVae Pray Martines,
a spokeswoman for the California Department of Forestry.
   Peter Reyes, 29, was arrested for investigation of arson, said
Maria Sabol, a spokeswoman for Orange County Fire Department.
   A 150-acre fire near Hemet, another Riverside County community,
injured 17 firefighters. Two inmates working firelines were
critically burned, officials said. In the Moreno Valley area of the
county, fire destroyed three homes.
   In Arizona, the Tonto National Forest fire scorched more than
21,000 acres, forest spokesman Ken Palmrose said. Lightning started
the fire Monday. The fire has destroyed at least 50 homes and
threatened about 700 more, officials said.
   Firefighters were unable to save a cabin built in the 1920s by
Zane Grey, a prolific Western novelist who drew on the picturesque,
pine-shaded Tonto Rim country for inspiration.
   Forest spokesman Bob Celaya said authorities still were trying
to learn how five inmates and a prison employee were killed Tuesday
while battling the fire.
   The victims were among several crews who were trapped when a
``dry thunderstorm'' struck the area, spreading the fire in all
directions.

   Former U.S. Rep. Mario Biaggi quietly was

2{-year sentence for accepting illegal gratuities, an official said
Thursday.
   Ralph Kistner, chief U.S. probation officer in Brooklyn, said
Biaggi, 72, was put on a curfew parole program, which means he is

   He will remain under the nighttime curfew until Aug. 7, when his
actual parole begins, Kistner said.
   Biaggi, the Democratic representative from the Bronx for nearly

obstruction of justice and interstate travel to commit a crime.
   He served 11 months of his sentence at a federal prison in Fort

   Chick Corea and Bobby McFerrin, out to have fun
and break some musical ground, wasted no time at the JVC Jazz
Festival making clear which of those aims comes first.
   Grammy-winning vocalist McFerrin strutted to his stool Wednesday
night at Carnegie Hall, sat down and began bouncing up and down.
Corea, the modern legend in jazz composing, perched over his bench
and flipped his long shirt tails backward over his head, then
grinned.
   Something was up.
   They were a perfect match for a disarmingly entertaining evening
of improvisation, one-on-one. Two of the most adventuresome artists
around sounded together like the Tom and Jerry of jazz, with a
healthy dose of cool.
   This was a fantastic combo that should be seen everywhere.
   After a bit of silly improv to warm up, the pair opened with a
rendition of ``Autumn Leaves'' that quickly evolved into an
experiment in sound and laughs that would set the tone for the
two-hour concert.
   McFerrin's expansive voice and Corea's ebullient acoustic piano
sounded nearly like a full band. McFerrin threw in some trombone
licks while keeping the bass line humming from somewhere in his
chest; Corea plucked the piano's strings to add the beat.
   Soon they both were leaning into the grand piano, backs nearly
to the audience, drumming on its frame and yelping and finding
sounds in the instrument that Steinway never imagined.
   The duo brought the audience fully into the show in the second
half. McFerrin hopped between two spots on the stage that he
designated ``ee'' and ``ahh.'' With a hop he had the nearly full
house belting ``ahh,'' then ``ee,'' while Corea added discordant
tones of his own.
   McFerrin would venture into the crowd several times before the
concert finished. In one flurry, he had the audience pass a glass
of water from front to back, then had them pass towels, and when at
a loss for more props, offered himself and traversed Carnegie's 35
rows horizontally.
   Humor was the key to the show, but it never masked talent.
   Corea in the second half came up with a delightfully spry
rendition of his own ``Spain,'' with McFerrin adding the full
orchestra and chorus.
   Corea also brought out the serious side of the performance, and
at times seemed barely able to keep from becoming McFerrin's
straight man.
   But each performer tapped his own highly energized imagination,
style and personality to make the concert work in a way few others
could. The men clearly understand each other, after just three
concerts together, and both exuded McFerrin's concert-ending advice:
   ``Go bonkers for at least one hour a day.''

<BYLINE>Lithuanian Parliament Begins Debating Independence Moratorium
^By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VILNIUS, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lithuania's legislators began debating
a freeze of their declaration of independence Thursday, and some
questioned whether Mikhail S. Gorbachev has the credibility or
staying power to stick to a compromise.
   Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene told the Supreme
Council parliament that Gorbachev had promised to end an economic
blockade and begin negotiations if Lithuania places a moratorium on
the March 11 declaration.
   She suggested a resolution that would impose a three-month
moratorium, to take effect when negotiations with the Kremlin
actually begin. Mrs. Prunskiene told parliament Gorbachev will not
require a freeze on laws that followed the declaration of
independence. One of those laws replaced the Soviet Constitution
with a Lithuanian document.
   ``The moratorium is only on the declaration of independence, not
on all the other acts,'' Mrs. Prunskiene told parliament. ``It's a
political statement.''
   ``The status of Lithuania doesn't change and the Supreme Council
remains the same,'' she said, pressing parliament to accept a
compromise.
   Parliament adjourned Thursday without making a decision. But
Mrs. Prunskiene's assurances were not enough for many legislators.
   ``We fear that if we accept this, Moscow would immediately
install an alternative government,'' said legislator Klemas Inta.
``We fear that they could deceive us.''
   Lithuania was an independent country between the world wars but
was occupied by Soviet soldiers in 1940 and absorbed into the
Soviet Union.
   ``There is a panic in the country that we might be tricked,''
said newspaper editor Algis Cekuolis.
   Inta pointed to the mound of letters the parliament has received
from people opposing any suspension of the declaration of
independence, despite Gorbachev's blockade.
   About 50,000 workers have lost their jobs since the Kremlin cut
all oil, most natural gas and other raw materials and manufactured
goods 10 weeks ago. The blockade is barely visible in Vilnius, the
Lithuanian capital. Most workers still are earning vacation pay,
hot water is flowing, and there is no need for heat.
   As a result, there is little sign of the economic sanctions
wearing down the republic's determination.
   Several hundred people gathered outside parliament during the
debate Thursday to protest the moratorium proposal.
   ``You cannot give yourself up into captivity,'' said engineer
Richardas Nomicas. ``A compromise is needed, but this is not it.''
   Mrs. Prunskiene told parliament it must accept a deal because
the West is demanding a compromise, and the economic blockade could
turn Lithuania into a disaster area by winter.
   The Kremlin released a statement late Tuesday saying talks with
Lithuania cannot begin until the republic declares a moratorium on
its independence declaration. It said the talks can only be held in
the framework of a nationwide discussion of a new treaty of union
among republics.
   One member of parliament, Eduardas Vilkas, said after listening
to Mrs. Prunskiene that he understood her to be requesting ``a
political step ... to say that Gorbachev is not the loser.''
   Vilkas said he favored a compromise but warned that many
Lithuanian legislators oppose a deal. ``This is very difficult
psychologically for many deputies,'' he said.
   Lithuania's president, Vytautas Landsbergis, told the parliament
he would speak in more detail on the proposed deal Friday.
   On Thursday, Landsbergis did not endorse a compromise but said
``it's most important to get the negotiations started.'' In
response to a question, he said he understood from talks with
Gorbachev that the economic blockade would be lifted immediately
when the moratorium went into effect.
   Landsbergis said the Lithuanian leadership wanted to choose the
best conditions for entering critical talks over just how
independence could be achieved.
   There was no indication when parliament would make a decision.
   Some leaders, including Landsbergis, say the Soviet political
landscape is changing so rapidly that Lithuania might do better to
wait.
   On Friday, the Communist Party leadership is scheduled to meet
to make final preparations for the national party congress that
begins Monday in Moscow.
   Gorbachev is likely to face bitter criticism from both
traditional communists and reformers, and may face a challenge to
his party leadership.
   Cekuolis, the newspaper editor, said he believes Gorbachev wants
to enter the party congress saying he has solved the Lithuanian
crisis.
   Lithuanian legislators acknowledged that their plans partially
hinged on whether they think Gorbachev has the power to withstand
any challenge to his leadership.
   Legislator Valerijonas Sadreika said, ``If the situation in
Russia changes, and a more conservative leader emerges, it would be
more complicated to negotiate with Russia.''
   In that case, Lithuania should act on Gorbachev's offer while it
can, Cekuolis said.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of farmers seeking guaranteed
minimum prices for their produce occupied the Ministry of
Agriculture on Thursday and rejected demands they end the protest
to clear the way for negotiations.
   The 600 farmers blocked employees from entering the ministry.
They marched through central Warsaw to the building Wednesday and
occupied it overnight after a delegation reported no results from
preliminary discussions with Cabinet members.
   ``Our demands are the same ones we've been presenting to the
government for half a year,'' said Boguslaw Wlodarczyk of the
farmers' strike committee. Farmers will occupy the building ``until
it is solved,'' he said.
   Agriculture Minister Czeslaw Janicki said ``substantial talks''
could begin if the protesters left the building. But strike
committee chairman Wladyslaw Wrona said that would signal defeat.
``We shall let in (only) those who come to settle our problems,''
he said.
   He also turned down an invitation to hold talks with the
Solidarity caucus of parliament.
   The protesters occupied a conference room and sat in hallways.
Farmers at the door tussled with employees who tried to enter.
   The farmers seek government-set minimum prices as a buffer
against the effects of a government program to create a market
economy from Poland's socialized system of the last four decades.
They also want more favorable loan terms and assurances of
profitability for farming.
   Poland's post-Communist government has repeatedly stated that
the success of the reforms depends on consistency, and that to
yield to strike pressure will only unleash a torrent of requests
from other sectors.
   The farmers' protest is the third serious challenge to the
government reform drive in the past two months. The other two,
involving dairy farmers and railway workers, were suspended at
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa's appeal.
   The government has appealed for labor peace to give the reforms
time to work and has taken a firm line against negotiating with
strikers.
   It likens the farmers' demands for minimum prices to the
subsidies the Communist regime used to satisfy farmers. Those
subsidies kept consumer prices artificially low.
   The reform program cut most subsidies, lifted price controls,
let interest rates rise to reflect the level of inflation and
opened the economy to private ventures.
   While refusing to set guaranteed prices, the government has
created an Agricultural Market Agency to begin work in July. It
will buy grain as needed to help support price levels. The
government also has indicated a willingness to take limited steps
to regulate other agricultural sectors, including the especially
hard-hit dairy industry.
   The farmers, accustomed to guaranteed markets in food-short
Poland, have been chided for failing to react to new competitive
market conditions.
   ``Once could discern ... statements of farmers longing for times
when farmers didn't have freedom, but when they knew how much they
could sell their products for and when everything they offered was
being bought,'' the newspaper Rzeczpospolita said, reporting on the
Agriculture Ministry protest.
   The growers contend that special conditions of farming,
including the year-long cycle of sowing, harvesting, selling and
planning investment for the next planting, require government
flexibility.
   Seventy-five percent of Poland's farmland is privately owned.
But nearly half the farms are small plots whose tillers say they
have neither the time nor transport to seek markets for their
products other than the local, quasi-governmental cooperatives
established under the socialist system.
   These cooperatives have cut prices paid to farmers because of
huge inventories, created by consumers unwilling to buy at prices
that have increased up to 1,000 percent in the last year.

   Nordlinger's firm is just one of several that assist lobbyists
nationwide without actually doing any lobbying themselves. They are
an unregulated and potentially potent force that is one part of the
future of legislative lobbying.
   Another glint of things to come shines in the 27th floor offices
of TRW Inc. in Arlington, Va. From this steel and glass aerie
overlooking Washington, Ernie Labelle shapes TRW's sophisticated
approach to state legislative lobbying.
   Labelle, who directs state and constituent relations for the
huge space and defense contractor, talks about government as a
``partner'' and says business must do more than respond to
legislation _ it must shape it.
   TRW employs a ``vice president for public policy analysis''
whose full-time job, essentially, is to think deeply about
important issues. It doesn't matter whether they have anything to
do with TRW directly; the company sees benefits in the most
tangential things.
   On a more down-to-earth level, TRW sends lobbyists into 15 or 20
states a year. It also has designed a computerized ``constituent
network'' that allows Labelle to instantly tap into the company's
50,000-plus employees in the United States and get them on the
phone to their legislators.
   ``It's a very structured, focused, disciplined, systems approach
to grassroots lobbying,'' he said.

<HEAD>FAA: Eight Close Calls in Chicago Area Recent Days</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Air traffic controllers in the Chicago area
allowed eight close calls between airplanes in a recent 10-day
period, the Federal Aviation Administration said.
   One of the most serious involved two Northwest Airlines jets,
both flying at 33,000 feet, which came within nine-tenths of a mile
of each other, according to a preliminary FAA investigation.
   A second incident involved a flight on which the governor of
Iowa was a passenger, the FAA said.
   ``We're upset about it,'' Mark Scholl, an official of the
National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said of the rash of
incidents that occurred between June 17 and Tuesday. ``We don't
have an explanation for it. There's not a common thread.''
   But Scholl said Wednesday he believed the eight incidents at the
Chicago Air Route Traffic Control Center in Aurora were an
aberration.
   None of the incidents was classified as a ``near midair
collision,'' FAA spokesman Mort Edelstein said.
   Edelstein said an investigative team was looking at all eight
incidents. He said some changes went into effect Wednesday in an
effort to correct the situation, but declined to elaborate.
   In all of 1989, controllers made 34 ``operational errors,'' in
which planes stray closer than the minimum separation allowed by
the FAA, Edelstein said. So far this year, 25 such errors have
occurred, he said.
   The Northwest Airlines incident took place Saturday when a DC-9
with 32 passengers came within nine-tenths of a mile of another
Northwest jet, a Boeing 727, with 131 passengers.
   The incident involving Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad occurred June 21
over Indiana when an American Airlines 727 came within 200 feet
vertically and 1.6 miles horizontally of an Iowa National Guard
plane carrying 16 people, including Branstad.
   Scholl said a controller trainee apparently issued incorrect
altitude orders to the American flight.
   In six of the incidents, a computer alerted controllers to the
problem. In the two others, the alert system was not activated.
Those two incidents were classified as minor because 80 percent of
the minimum separation was maintained.

   Two youths tried to hijack a Soviet jet to Turkey
on Thursday and threatened to poison the 165 passengers on board,
but crew members and others foiled the attempt, Tass said.
   There have been three successful hijackings this month of Soviet
planes. Also this month, a pilot seized an empty Soviet airliner
and flew it to Turkey.
   Tass said two people were arrested, and identified one as
17-year-old Yu. Kapirushov. Criminal charges have been filed, it
said.
   The plane, a medium-range Tupolev 154 jet with 165 passengers on
board, was seized Thursday afternoon on a flight from Krasnodar in
southern Russia to the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk. Hijackers
threatened to poison the passengers, Tass said.
   But it reported that the pilot, V. Alexandrov, landed the plane
in Orenburg, about 870 miles northeast of Krasnodar, and that the
hijackers were captured ``thanks to ... actions by the crew and a
special force.''
   It did not identify the force or give any more details.
   On Sunday, a young Soviet man claiming to have a bomb in his
briefcase forced a Soviet domestic airliner to land in Finland,
then surrendered to police. The 21-year-old man asked for political
asylum.
   Another Soviet airliner was diverted June 19 to Helsinki. The
20-year-old hijacker of that flight also asked for political asylum.
   A day earlier, a 29-year-old pilot flew a 12-seat plane from the
Ukraine to Turkey, where he asked for political asylum.
   On June 9, a 17-year-old youth forced a domestic Soviet plane to
land in Sweden by threatening the pilot with a fake hand grenade.
The youth has been arraigned in court but has not asked for
political asylum. He said he wanted to leave his home in
Byelorussia after a quarrel with his father.

   Effi Barry, wife of Mayor Marion Barry, says
she tried to darken her skin at her husband's request 12 years ago
after a reporter erroneously said she was white.
   ``I'm mulatto,'' Mrs. Barry said in a recorded interview with
the syndicated television show ``A Current Affair.''
   Her husband, ``the consummate politician,'' urged her to ``get a
suntan'' after the press ``tremors'' shook his first mayoral
campaign in 1978.
   The sunlamp treatments did not work, she added.
   ``So, a group of us, of my friends, we went to Hilton Head
(South Carolina) and the mission was to get me a suntan so I would
not appear to be too white in pictures.
   ``These are some of the kinds of things that are really silly
when it comes to color and race,'' she said.
   Mrs. Barry said she remembered teaching in New York City in the
1960s and being too white to be part of the civil rights movement.
``So you really can't win sometimes,'' she said.
   Mrs. Barry, whose father was white and mother was black, made
the comments in the interview which will be broadcast on July 2.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Thursday officially asked
the Senate to ratify the agreement he made with Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev on underground nuclear weapons tests.
   The accord signed by the two countries June 1 during Gorbachev's
visit to Washington spells out measures against cheating on
existing treaties that limit nuclear tests.
   The agreement will permit both nations to ratify the 1974
Threshold Test Ban Treaty and the 1976 Peaceful Nuclear Explosion
Treaty, which limits U.S. and Soviet underground nuclear tests to
150 kilotons.
   The accords recently agreed to by the two countries ``represent
the successful culmination of several years of effort to provide
for effective verification of compliance with the treaties,'' Bush
said in his letter transmitting the treaty protocols to the Senate.
   Changes at the U.S. nuclear test site in Nevada that are
required to meet the agreement ``were considered carefully and have
been judged manageable and therefore acceptable in the interests of
effective verification,'' Bush wrote.

<TEXT>
   Greater efforts are needed to prevent pregnant
women from abusing drugs, witnesses told a Senate panel Thursday.
But they differed on how to deal with the problem of drug-addicted
babies.
   ``We have a public health emergency with crack cocaine,'' said
Sen. Daniel Moynihan, D-N.Y., who presided over a Senate Finance
Committee hearing on the scope of the drug baby crisis.
   Two reports released at the hearing said the number of babies
born to women who abused drugs during pregnancy may be several
times higher than is reported by hospitals.
   Estimates that between 100,000 and 375,000 drug-exposed infants
are born each year may be far too low because many hospitals do not
screen and test pregnant women for drug use, a General Accounting
Office study said.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan said federal
programs and demonstration projects are making more treatment
available, but he said ``we need the help of the American people.''
   ``Anyone who knows a drug- or alcohol-using pregnant woman has
the duty to warn her away from these substances ... this is
especially the responsibility of the baby's father,'' Sullivan said.
   He also said he is asking the Public Health Service to educate
the public about the risks of drug use during pregnancy _ including
the greater likelihood that the baby will have medical and
developmental problems.
   Sullivan did not say more money was needed in the drug war.
Rather, he said, ``I firmly believe that the administration is
meeting these challenges effectively.''
   But Comptroller General Charles Bowsher said a General
Accounting Office study released Thursday showed the drug problem
could decrease with more federal funding.
   After visiting hospitals in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New
York and San Antonio, GAO investigators concluded that
``nationwide, drug treatment services are insufficient,'' he said
in his prepared testimony.
   He cited a recent survey by the National Association of State
Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors estimating that 280,000 pregnant
women nationwide needed drug treatment, but less than 11 percent of
them received care.
   Less than 1 percent of the federal anti-drug funding is targeted
specifically at treatment for women, and the percentage is even
less for addicted pregnant women, he said.
   ``Expanding drug treatment services might reduce the number of
drug-exposed births and alleviate some of the family dysfunction
that is contributing to the growing number of child abuse and
neglect cases and foster placements,'' he said.
   The cost of services for a baby born with problems because of
its mother's drug use is estimated to be about $750,000 for the
first 18 years of life, he said.
   Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said more emphasis is needed on
preventing drug and alcohol abuse, but he added skeptically: ``When
all is said and done, there's always a lot more said than done.''

   Consumer advocates opened a new window on the
health-care community Thursday with a state-by-state roster of
6,892 medical professionals who have been disciplined by state and
federal agencies.
   The two-inch-thick compendium, put together by the Public
Citizen Health Research Group, lists actions taken against
physicians and other medical professionals in 40 states and the
District of Columbia.
   ``If your doctor is among the 6,892 on this list, you ought at
least to question the quality of his or her care,'' said Dr. Sidney
Wolfe, director of the Public Citizen Health Research Group. ``At
the very minimum, you should find out why'' the doctor is on the
list.
   The nation's system for protecting the public from incompetent
physicians has ``vastly improved'' in the last 15 years, but
remains inadequate, said the group, founded by consumer activist
Ralph Nader.
   ``Gaps the size of the Grand Canyon may have shrunk to Texas
arroyos (desert stream beds), but they still snake everywhere
across the landscape,'' the group's report said.
   ``And those dangerous doctors who fall through the cracks
continue to kill, maim, defraud and otherwise injure their
unknowing patients.''
   The guide contains the names of physicians, dentists,
chiropractors and podiatrists who have been disciplined by state
medical boards, Medicare or the federal Drug Enforcement
Administration.
   Also, each state's section lists doctors who have addresses in
that state but were disciplined by medical boards in other states.
It also contains the reason for the action, where available.
   Public Citizen said its compendium is the first such nationwide
roster available to the public.
   The federal government is preparing to open a National
Practitioner Data Bank, which will have information on state
disciplinary actions, malpractice payments and revocation of
hospital privileges.
   Public Citizen has complained that this information will not be
available to the public. It will be accessible primarily to
hospitals, health maintenance organizations and government agencies.
   Public Citizen asked state medical boards and federal agencies
for actions taken against doctors since 1985. Some states provided
actions that went back even further, while others provided data for
only the last year or two.
   Still others didn't provide any information at all.
   State medical boards in Alabama, Alaska, Colorado, Oklahoma and
South Dakota ``adamantly refused'' to provide the requested data,
Public Citizen said.
   Five other states _ Arizona, Arkansas, Maine, Mississippi and
New Mexico _ were willing to provide at least some information, but
for various reasons did not, Public Citizen said.

<HEAD>Jury Begins Deliberations in Marcos, Khashoggi Fraud Trial</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A jury Tuesday began deliberating whether former
Philippines first lady Imelda Marcos looted her country of $222
million and secretly invested the money with the help of Saudi
financier Adnan Khashoggi.
   The panel was given the case after hearing instructions from
U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan.
   Keenan dismissed the five alternate jurors and requested they
not discuss the case with reporters until after a verdict.
   As the jury left the courtroom to begin deliberations, family
members and supporters embraced Mrs. Marcos.
   Mrs. Marcos, who turns 61 Monday, told a reporter, ``Pray for me
a happy birthday.''
   She faces up to 50 years in prison and a $1 million fine if
convicted of racketeering, racketeering conspiracy, mail fraud and
obstructing justice.
   The jurors also are considering mail fraud and obstruction of
justice charges against Khashoggi, 54.
   The judge told the jury to consider how much Mrs. Marcos knew of
the alleged crimes. But he added that she can be found guilty if
she ``closed her eyes'' to whether stolen money was used for
investments in the United States.
   Mrs. Marcos' knowledge was a central theme in closing arguments
earlier in the week.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles LaBella said the widow of ousted
Phillipines President Ferdinand Marcos had to know ``dirty money''
was used to buy four New York buildings, jewelry and art work.
   Her attorney, Gerry Spence, denied she was aware of the
transactions, and said the case was a prosecutor's fantasy.
   Keenan said the jury must consider whether Mrs. Marcos knew the
money was taken by fraud or whether she ``deliberately closed her
eyes.''
   He said the jurors can convict only if they find the defendants'
guilt was proven beyond reasonable doubt. He said direct and
circumstantial evidence are given the same weight.
   In addressing the racketeering charges, the judge said the
government did not have to prove that Mrs. Marcos herself committed
the fraud.
   ``A person who aids or abets the commission of an offense is
just as guilty of that offense as if he or she committed it himself
or herself,'' he said. ``Of course, the mere presence of a
defendant where a crime is being committed, even coupled with
knowledge that a crime is occurring ... is not sufficient to
establish aiding and abetting.''
   Mrs. Marcos is alleged to have helped her husband embezzle $222
million from their country's treasury, using the money for secret
investments and spending sprees.
   Khashoggi allegedly served as a front for the Marcoses to
conceal ownership of the four New York buildings and art works
after they were ousted from power in February 1986 and the new
government sued to recover their riches. He could draw a 10-year
prison term and $500,000 in fines if convicted.

   Thieves smashed a museum window
Thursday and made off with three van Gogh paintings after the
museum's alarm system, described as fail-safe, did not go off.
   The Noordbrabants Museum lost the prize paintings of its
collection to thieves who jumped several fences and broke the
ground-floor window of the gallery where the paintings were
hanging, officials said.
   Stolen were ``The Sitting Farmer's Wife,'' ``The Digging
Farmer's Wife'' and ``Wheels of the Water Mill in Gennep.'' The
museum's deputy director, Peter Veenland, said their total value
was $2.7 million to $5.4 million.
   He said the paintings were insured but refused to say for how
much.
   Vincent van Gogh painted them while living in what is now the
town of Nuenen, 18 miles from the museum.
   It was the third time in two years that paintings by the Dutch
impressionist had been stolen from museums in the Netherlands.
   The Noordbrabants Museum has what Veenland called a
``state-of-the-art updated alarm system.'' It has two elements
designed to detect intruders _ seismic sensors measure movement and
infrared sensors to measure body heat.
   The security system was turned on and being monitored by a
security firm, but both sets of sensors in the van Gogh gallery
were found to be inoperative, Veenland told The Associated Press in
an interview.
   ``The system should have showed up that the sensors were not
working,'' Veenland said. ``But it didn't happen, and it is a
mystery to us why.''
   Veenland refused to speculate on whether the alarms were
intentionally disabled, or on the possible involvement of museum
staff. Police were questioning staff members.
   Neighbors heard the sound of breaking glass at about 12:30 a.m.
and called police.
   Veenland said the thieves, who police believe numbered three,
had to tear the framed paintings off anchors in the wall.
   It was the first theft from the museum, which moved about two
years ago to its current home, a converted granite mansion in this
provincial capital 53 miles south of Amsterdam.
   The museum has about 300 works.
   The 25-by-32.7 inch ``Water Mill'' was painted in 1884. The
15-by-11.25 inch ``Sitting Farmer's Wife'' and the
15.6-by-10.7-inch ``Digging Farmer's Wife'' were done in 1885.
   Van Gogh painted them during his so-called Brabant period, when
he used as his models the poor peasantry of the Brabant, which
encompasses a large part of the southern Netherlands.
   Guy Jennings, an impressionism expert at Christie's auction
house in London, called the stolen paintings ``minor works''
compared to van Gogh's later output, but both he and Veenland said
it would be impossible to sell them on the open market.
   Van Gogh's Brabant period works are generally dark in tone and
employ none of the bright impressionist colors, such as those used
in ``Irises,'' which have brought record auction prices.
   The most significant of the Dutch impressionist's works are in
Amsterdam's van Gogh Museum and the Kroeller-Mueller Museum near
the eastern Dutch town of Otterloo.
   In December 1988, three van Goghs, including one version of his
famous depiction of rural poverty, ``The Potato Eaters,'' were
stolen from the Kroeller-Mueller.
   In May of 1988, three other works by modern masters, including
van Gogh's ``Carnations,'' were taken from Amsterdam's Municipal
Museum.
   All were recovered.

<HEAD>Bush Expected to Seek NATO Declaration of No Threat</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush probably will ask NATO allies
to declare formally next week that they do not pose a threat to
nations of the Warsaw Pact, Secretary of State James A. Baker said
Thursday.
   The declaration would be intended to calm Moscow's anxieties
about a united Germany being a military and political member of
NATO.
   Baker said it would be premature now for the United States to
give cash aid to the Soviet Union to help its sickly economy.
   Instead, he suggested that the major industrialized nations, at
an economic summit in Houston next month, consider guidelines for
financial assistance for Moscow.
   Western European leaders on Wednesday agreed in principle to aid
Moscow but have not considered specific proposals or amounts, and
some analysts have suggested trading such aid for Soviet military
cutbacks. Germany already is guaranteeing loans to the Soviet Union.
   Baker spoke at a White House briefing to set the stage for a
16-nation NATO summit in London next week and the seven-nation
economic gathering in Houston the following week.
   At his briefing, Baker said NATO should stick with its
decades-old policy of threatening to fire nuclear weapons first in
response to a major Soviet attack with conventional weapons.
   Though this so-called ``flexible response'' strategy may be
discussed, ``I would suspect that there won't be any (change),''
Baker said. ``I don't think we ought to make Europe safe for
conventional war.''
   The idea of a non-aggression statement was raised by Bush in an
interview with foreign journalists on Wednesday.
   ``It's appropriate to at least give some consideration to this
idea that there could be some sort of a declaration of
nonaggression, defensive intent, peaceful intent,'' Baker said.
   He said any such statement probably would be directed at the
member states of the Warsaw Pact rather than the Soviet-led
alliance itself.
   Baker said the United States is not trying to restrain other
nations from coming to the Soviets' aid, but feels Moscow must
reform its state-controlled economy before the money can be spent
in a meaningful way.
   ``I've been to 10 of these economic summits, the last 10, and
I've never been to one yet where there's been total agreement on
every issue,'' Baker added.
   Bush departs Friday for a long holiday weekend at his vacation
home in Kennebunkport, Maine before flying to London on July 4.
   With the two summits, he will be away from Washington until the
early morning hours of July 12.
   The Pentagon announced that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is
delaying a visit to several NATO nations to confer with Bush in
Maine before the London meetings
   Cheney had been scheduled to leave Saturday for a two-week NATO
tour, but has put off his departure until Monday evening so he can
meet with Bush earlier in the day at the president's summer home in
Kennebunkport.
   The two men are expected to discuss, among other things, the
East-West conventional force reduction talks in Vienna and the
alliance's response to the revolutionary changes that have swept
the Soviet bloc.
   The defense secretary is slated to visit nations on the flanks
of the alliance, including Norway, Greece, Turkey, Portugal and
Spain.
   ``The secretary has already visited the principal NATO allies in
the central region and he believed it was very important to give
equal attention to our very important allies in the southern and
northern region,'' a senior defense official said.
   The official, speaking on condition he not be identified, said
``the Soviet posture on the flanks and those borders is still quite
significant.''
   While in Greece, Cheney plans to sign a new defense agreement
that allows U.S. bases to remain there for the next eight years,
the official said.
   The United States has four bases and about 20 smaller units in
Greece, but is closing two of them in part of a world-wide
cost-cutting drive.

<HEAD>Brady Asks Congress for Speedy Debt-Limit Hike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, saying
the federal government will run out of money and borrowing
authority late this summer, asked Congress on Thursday to raise the
debt limit before its August recess.
   The current ceiling is $3.12 trillion. The nation's debt stood
at $3.05 trillion on Thursday after topping the $3 trillion mark
for the first time in April.
   ``Based on our current estimate, it appears likely that, without
an increase in the debt limit, the Treasury will run out of cash
and borrowing authority and default on the government's obligations
in mid-August,'' Brady said in a letter to Rep. Bill Frenzel,
R-Minn.
   But Brady added that a significant increase in spending on the
savings and loan bailout could require a debt-limit increase
earlier that month.
   ``In any case, it is highly likely that default would occur
before Congress returns in September,'' the secretary said.
   His letter to the ranking Republican on the House Budget
Committee did not include a dollar amount, saying that would follow
as soon as the midyear review of the budget is available next month
from the Office of Management and Budget.
   ``At that time, we will also advise you of our best estimate of
the date that default would occur absent action to increase the
debt limit,'' Brady wrote.
   The government narrowly averted its first default last November,
when Congress raised the debt limit from $2.8 trillion for the
fiscal year ending Sept. 30.
   Although the government has never defaulted, it has come close
on several other occasions.
   For example, it had to dip into Social Security funds to keep
its line of credit open in 1985. And in 1983, a delay in increasing
the debt limit forced the government to exhaust its line of credit,
leading to a suspension of savings bond sales, restrictions on
deposits to the Social Security funds and cancellation of scheduled
securities auctions.
   The national debt has more than tripled since the beginning of
the decade as the Treasury was forced to borrow more and more money
to finance government spending that exceeds tax receipts.
   The annual deficits have gone down from their peak of over $200
billion a year, but the deficit still totaled $152.1 billion in the
year ending last Sept. 30. It totaled $151.68 billion after the
first eight months of the current fiscal year and some analysts say
it could return to the $200 billion level again by year's end.

<DATELINE>MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands gathered outside the Miami
Beach Convention Center where Nelson Mandela spoke Thursday. Some
hoped for a glimpse of their hero, others protested his support for
Cuba's Fidel Castro.
   Blacks and Hispanics have long been at odds in the Miami area.
Tensions rose to a fever pitch late last year during the trial of a
Hispanic policeman whose shooting of a black motorcyclist triggered
three days of rioting in Miami during January 1989.
   The Mandela visit with its political rhetoric and rejection of
the anti-apartheid leader by several Cuban-American mayors in south
Florida inflamed those tensions once again.
   Metal barricades and police in riot gear and on horseback kept
the mostly black pro-Mandela crowd away from several hundred Cuban
exiles, who burned a Soviet flag and shouted ``Down with Mandela!''
   Police broke up several scuffles between the factions and
quickly ushered away two self-described rednecks carrying signs
saying Fight Communism: Support the Afrikaner Resistance Movement.
There were no arrests, police said.
   While Cubans denounced the 71-year-old Mandela for his ties to
Castro, blacks harshly criticized the protests, chanting ``Free
South Florida.'' They promised to retaliate on election day against
Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez and other Cuban-born politicians who
denounced Mandela and stayed away during his visit.
   ``I'm very embarrassed. I feel this is one of the bleakest
moments Miami has experienced,'' said Willie Haywood, a 34-year-old
postal worker.
   ``They had ticker-tape parades for him in New York and hundreds
of thousands saw him speak in Boston,'' Haywood said. ``Now we have
the distinction of being the most racist city in America.''
   At a rally across Biscayne Bay in Miami's predominantly black
Liberty City, former federal Judge Alcee Hastings, a longtime black
leader, lamented Mandela's treatment.
   ``It's shameful we didn't do better,'' said Hastings. ``We're
the only city that didn't provide this world-class leader with a
grand welcome.''
   Thursday's gathering of exiles in Miami Beach was the first
large-scale protest on Mandela's U.S. tour. South Florida, which
has seen three inner-city riots in the 1980s, is the only area
where politicians have not clamored to share Mandela's spotlight.
   ``They should be here with the keys to the city,'' said Joe
Cook, 40, with long dredlocks and an African medallion on his
chest. ``Anybody who turns his back on him is a little bitty man.''
   While waiting for Mandela, supporters outside the convention
center sang the African National Congress' anthem and musicians in
traditional African costumes pounded a steady drumbeat. Hundreds of
people sprinted around the block in hopes of catching a bit of
history when he finally pulled into a side entrance.
   ``I saw him! I saw Mandela!'' shouted Rovan Locke, the publisher
of Miami-based Caribbean Commentary magazine. ``Such a great human
being in my midst. It's the greatest feeling in my life.''
   Mandela left for Detroit immediately after his speech to the
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union,
bypassing an invitation to address the impromptu rally in Miami's
Liberty City, the scene in 1980 of one of the nation's worst race
riots.
   Cuban exiles said they would have no praise for Mandela until he
disassociates himself from Castro. On national TV last week,
Mandela praised the Cuban president for his help in the years when
the West refused to support his anti-apartheid struggle.
   ``Mandela is a traitor,'' said Ricardo Acabader, 67, who wore a
Cuban flag over his shoulders.
   ``We're not singling out Mandela's cause. We are opposed to
anyone who does not oppose Castro,'' added Rafael Cabezas, a
veteran of the failed Bay of Pigs invasion.
   Mandela has also cited Palestine Liberation Organization leader
Yasser Arafat and Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi for their help.
Jewish leaders said the comments were troubling, but only a few
Jewish protesters joined the demonstration against Mandela.

<HEAD>Soviet Rescue Team Pulls Boy Alive from Quake Rubble</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Soviet rescuers pulled a 9-year-old boy
alive from the rubble of his home nearly a week after his family's
residence was flattened by an earthquake, the official news media
said Thursday.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency said Morteza Amirpour was found
late Wednesday next to the bodies of family members in the ruins of
Rahmatabad, 125 miles northwest of Tehran. He was freed 162 hours
after the quake, IRNA said.
   The boy, who was in a coma, was taken to a provincial hospital
for treatment, the agency said. It provided no further details.
   A week after the temblor, casualty figures varied: officials of
the Red Crescent, Iran's equivalent of the Red Cross, say they
counted 40,000 dead and 60,000 injured. Government officials say
50,000 Iranians died, 200,000 were injured and 500,000 were left
homeless.
   The earthquake, centered near the Caspian Sea about 125 miles
northwest of Tehran, destroyed 1,755 schools and caused an
estimated $625 million in damage, IRNA said.
   Also Thursday, Iran's ambassador to the United Nations thanked
the 86 nations that contributed aid and issued an appeal for
international assistance to rebuild the devastated regions.
   ``There is an urgent and continued need for international
cooperation, not only to alleviate present suffering but also to
make the areas as safe as possible in the future,'' Kamal Kharrazi
told the General Assembly.
   To date, Kharrazi said, 171 planeloads of supplies have reached
the Iranian capital of Tehran. In addition, about 100 teams have
been set up to fight disease and to disinfect disaster areas, he
said.
   Fifteen aftershocks Wednesday and Thursday jolted the
northwestern provinces of Gilan and Zanjan, which bore the brunt of
the June 21 earthquake, the agency said.
   Reporting from the devastated township of Rudbar, the agency
said one grieving woman who lost her husband and five children in
the quake was refusing to eat.
   ``How can I eat while I myself wrapped the bodies of my beloved
children in shrouds and buried them?'' it quoted the woman, Goncheh
Ibrahimi, as saying.
   The June 21 quake, which registered 7.3 to 7.7 on the Richter
Scale, according to Western and Iranian accounts, is the deadliest
since an estimated 200,000 people died in a 1978 earthquake in
China.
   There have been more than 400 aftershocks in the Iranian fault
zone the last week. The Geophysics Center at Tehran University said
the strongest aftershock measured 4.8.
   But IRNA quoted an unidentified senior official at the Tehran
center as saying the tectonic fault that caused the deadly quake
was ``gradually stabilizing.''
   That was welcome news for the thousands of Iranian and foreign
rescue workers who have been clawing through the rubble of 342
flattened towns and villages in the rugged region.
   The aftershocks have blocked roads, halting truck convoys
carrying tents, blankets, medicine and food into the stricken
provinces.
   IRNA said one of the latest tremors caused landslides that
blocked a key road between Rasht on the Caspian Sea and Rudbar to
the southwest for the second time in a week.
   Relief officials said that with hope running out of finding
survivors trapped in the rubble, the relief operation is
concentrating more on taking care of the living.
   IRNA said Mohammad Hassan Eftekhari, a member of the 270-seat
Majlis, or parliament, who died in Wednesday's crash of a relief
helicopter was given a hero's burial in his hometown of Fouman in
northern Iran.
   Four of the other 14 relief workers aboard the U.S.-built
Chinook transport were critically injured when it crashed in bad
weather in the mountainous Kelishom region in the southern sector
of the quake zone.

   The Agriculture Department said on Thursday it soon will begin
buying bulk ground beef and frozen beef patties for distribution
under the school lunch program for 1990-91.
   Part of the meat will be a test purchase having a maximum fat
content of 22 percent, compared with the current standard of 24
percent fat, said the department's Agricultural Marketing Service.
   Also, the agency said, a pilot program is being planned for
testing beef patties with a fat content as low as 10 percent.
Technical details for that project will be worked out with the

78 general and admirals over the next four years, it was announced
Thursday.
   Gen. Colin Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
had recommended that the slots be eliminated, Pentagon spokesman
Pete Williams said.
   Currently, there are 1,073 such positions in the military _ 407
generals in the Army, 338 in the Air Force, 70 in the Marine Corps
and 258 flag officers in the Navy.
   The cut will bring the new level to 995 such slots by 1995.
   At the end of April, there were 2 million men and women on
active duty in the nation's armed forces.
   The move is part of the Pentagon's effort to cut back its forces
amid the drive to save money and adjust to lessened East-West
tensions, Williams said.
   The reduction amounts to about a 7 percent cut in the number of
general and flag officer positions, a far cry from the much larger
cuts in store for some of the services. Army officials have
predicted that they may be cutting one soldier in four from the
ranks over the next five years.
   Powell, in a statement released at the Pentagon, said his
proposal had the backing of the service chiefs.
   ``The Joint Chiefs and I believe this plan reflects an
appropriate balance between continuing requirements and changing
force structure,'' Powell said. ``In light of anticipated force
structure changes, we recognize the necessity for general and flag
officer requirements and inventory to drop below current levels.''
   Williams said Cheney and Powell wanted to emphasize that it was
appropriate to begin force level reductions ``at the top'' and
among all the services.
   The cut means the elimination of 33 generals from the Army, 27
from the Air Force, three from the Marine Corps, and 15 flag
officers from the Navy.
   A total of 20 positions will be eliminated before the end of
1991, an additional 20 in each of the next two years and 18 in
1994, Williams said.
   The spokesman said that an attempt would be made to reduce the
numbers through retirement and attrition, but that additional steps
may have to be taken to make the cuts.
   ``I don't think retirement and attrition are going to do it,''
he said.
   Williams said that the exact job positions have not yet been
designated for elimination and that such decisions will be left to
the various services.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is taking a close look
at a letter from Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on Mideast
negotiations and may set up a meeting between Secretary of State
James A. Baker III and the new Israeli foreign minister, David Levy.
   Sources said Shamir reaffirmed his commitment to his own
proposal for elections among Palestinian Arabs on the West Bank and
Gaza and his interest in Baker resuming his effort to implement the
plan.
   The sources, declining to be identified, said the prime minister
did not specifically exclude Palestinians deported from the
territories from the negotiations.
   Shamir sent the letter in response to one from President Bush
inquiring about the prime minister's intentions now that he has
formed a new government. The last Israeli government, headed by
Shamir, collapsed in March in disagreement over whether to approve
Baker's formula for Israeli-Palestinian talks.
   A key stumbling block was a provision to include Palestinians
deported by the Israelis from the West Bank or others who had homes
in East Jerusalem.
   Even before Shamir replied, American and Israeli diplomats
discussed having Baker meet Levy, the new foreign minister. ``It's
a foregone conclusion they will meet eventually,'' a U.S. official
said.
   But plans have not jelled. Levy has been hospitalized with a
heart condition, complicating the situation.
   ``A meeting is one option under consideration, the idea being to
discuss the letter,'' a second U.S. official said.
   The sources said Shamir reaffirmed his intention to open the
elections to all residents of the West Bank and Gaza. He spoke in
general terms, thereby not excluding deported Palestinians, the
sources said.
   Baker declined to discuss the letter at a news conference at the
White House. The main topic of the session was the NATO summit
meeting to be held next week in London.
   ``We need more time to study the letter,'' Baker said.
   He implied there were positive and negative aspects to what
Shamir wrote to Bush. ``There are elements on both sides of the
equation,'' Baker said ambiguously.
   But he repeated: ``I don't want to make judgments until we have
more time to look at the letter.''
   Shamir's plan is to have elected Palestinians negotiate limited
self-rule with Israel. After five years, there would be wider
negotiations to arrange a lasting settlement.

<HEAD>U.S. Considers Exempting Canadian Meat From Border Inspection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A one-year experiment to exempt imports of
Canadian meat and poultry from U.S. border inspection is under
consideration as a move toward freer trade between the two
countries, the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   Ronald J. Prucha, associate administrator of the department's
Food Safety and Inspection Service, said the products would still
be thoroughly inspected at slaughter and processing plants in
Canada under a system that is nearly identical to U.S. inspection.
   However, he said, Canadian products in the proposed one-year
experiment would no longer be randomly sampled at the border. A
reciprocal arrangement would be used for U.S. meat and poultry
products entering Canada.
   Prucha said the proposal would help implement the United
States-Canada Free Trade Agreement.
   The proposal will be open for public comments through July 30
before a final decision is made. Comments can be sent to: FSIS

<HEAD>Official Says U.S. Has No Plan to Send Troops to Peru</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top State Department official said Thursday
that the United States has no intention of sending military troops
to fight the drug war in Peru.
   That scenario is the ``farthest thing from our mind,'' said
Melvyn Levitsky, assistant secretary of state for international
narcotics.
   Levitsky also told members of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee he is optimistic U.S. officials can reach an agreement
with Peruvian President-elect Alberto Fujimori about a strategy to
reduce the production of coca while encouraging economic
development.
   The U.S. plan calls for sending military equipment and
``trainers'' to help Peru's law enforcement agencies fight drugs.
   Fujimori said during his campaign that he would reject any
``foreign intervention'' in the war against drugs.
   But Levitsky said there may have been a misunderstanding on the
part of Fujimori about what the United States wants to do.
Officials at the U.S. Embassy in Lima have not discussed the
situation with Fujimori, Levitsky said.
   Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., said there was apparently ``confusion
about the new government's'' position on U.S. participation in
Peru's war on drugs. ``I am wary about the administration's
plans,'' he said.
   Fujimori, who must contend with a decade-long war with leftist
Shining Path guerrillas as well as with cocaine traffickers, said
he favors economic support to military force in eradicating coca
plantations.
   Last week, William J. Bennett, the administration's drug policy
coordinator, said he hopes to complete a formal agreement soon with
Peru so the United States can start providing military equipment
and training to Peruvian police and military.

<HEAD>U.S. Prepared to Provide Food Assistance to Angola</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The State Department said Thursday it is
prepared to provide emergency humanitarian assistance to Angola,
where independent estimates indicate that 250,000 people are at
immediate risk of starvation.
   The affected area is in the southern part of the country and
includes regions under the control of the government and the
U.S.-backed UNITA rebels.
   The department's statement welcomed a proposal by UNITA leader
Jonas Savimbi to establish ``corridors of peace'' to permit rapid
distribution of emergency assistance.
   ``We hope that the government in Luanda will respond favorably
to the proposal,'' the statement said. It also urged that Angola's
neighbors permit the use of their territory for passage of
humanitarian aid.
   Savimbi outlined his proposal in letters to President Bush and
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, whose government has provided
substantial aid to Angola for years.
   Savimbi, who called for a cease-fire in Angola's 15-year civil
war, also asked Bush and Gorbachev to undertake an emergency
airlift of food and medicine to the affected areas.
   Bush and Gorbachev agreed earlier this month to mount a joint
airlift of food for starving Ethiopians with U.S. food flown on
Soviet planes. The U.S. and Soviet leaders also discussed joint
sponsorship of peace talks between Savimbi and Angolan President
Eduardo Dos Santos.
   The International Committee of the Red Cross has estimated that
a quarter million Angolans may face starvation. Dos Santos has put
the figure at 1.55 million.

<HEAD>Feds Deny Secret Documents Hidden From Defense</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Manuel Noriega's prosecutors acknowledged Thursday
they have not given secret Panamanian files to the defense, but
blamed the failure on the enormous volume of documents, not
interference by intelligence agencies.
   Michael O'Kane, an attorney for Noriega co-defendant Daniel
Miranda, had charged that a ``secret inventory'' discovered by one
of his investigators showed about 40 file cabinets seized during
the U.S. invasion were missing from a U.S. military warehouse in
Panama.
   Federal Magistrate William Turnoff held a hearing Thursday on
the issue, and prosecutors, while not disputing the inventory's
authenticity, played down its importance.
   ``There are far more documents than we have actually placed in
the warehouse,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Sullivan said.
``We have just yards and yards of documents.''
   But he added that he could not say why the documents were not
made available to defense investigators in the Corozal warehouse in
Panama.
   ``We asked our people in Corozal for a reason and haven't
received one yet,'' he said.
   Sullivan promised to turn over any relevant files once they were
examined, but said that could take up until ``the morning of the
trial,'' which is set for Jan. 28.
   Following the government's assurances, O'Kane withdrew his
motion accusing prosecutors of violating Turnoff's order to hand
over appropriate documents.
   But he said the U.S. attorney's office had still not addressed
the question of whether documents were removed by U.S. intelligence
agencies.
   ``I think all you can say is they don't know either,'' O'Kane
said after the hearing.
   Diane Cossin, spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office, said
later that prosecutors have no indication so far that any files are
missing.
   O'Kane noted that Panamanian officials investigating corruption
under Noriega also have been denied access to the files.
   He said the list he found shows that during the December
invasion, the Army confiscated file cabinets containing Panamanian
intelligence files, weapons import-export records, confidential
correspondence and files on Noriega foes who plotted a coup.
   The list is far more extensive than an inventory turned over to
the defense by the U.S. attorney's office.
   The New York Times and The Washington Post have reported,
quoting unidentified sources, that Army intelligence officials have
complained they fear the CIA ``sanitized'' the captured files. The
CIA has denied the charges.
   Attorneys for the ousted Panamanian dictator have insisted that
many of his activities were sanctioned by the United States. They
have said that U.S. and Panamanian intelligence records would show
he cooperated with the CIA and the Drug Enforcement Administration.
   The disputed records are in the custody of the U.S. Southern
Command's 470th Military Intelligence Group at a warehouse in
Corozal. O'Kane said he sent a private investigator to the
warehouse to rummage through boxes of documents listed by the
government.
   The investigator found wadded up in one of the boxes as garbage
what O'Kane believes is the real inventory, the attorney said.
   O'Kane's client, Miranda, is out on bond on charges of helping
to fly drug money from Fort Lauderdale to Panama. If convicted, he
could be sentenced to five years in prison.
   Noriega, confined at the Metropolitan Correctional Center
outside of Miami, faces up to 145 years in prison if convicted of
accepting $4.6 million in bribes from Colombia's Medellin drug
cartel to turn Panama into a safe haven for U.S.-bound drugs.

   The Air Force will rely on hot, soapy water to
rid its military equipment of the remnants of chemical warfare
while the Navy plans to use a bleaching agent.
   But the Army and Marine Corps have for years been using a
decontaminating chemical called DS2 that six years ago ate through
an electronic cable on an M-1 tank.
   The selection has concerned lawmakers and prompted congressional
investigators to urge Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to direct the
Army and Marine Corps to chose a safer, cheaper alternative.
   ``It could be, literally, another Agent Orange sitting out
there,'' Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., chairman of the House Government
Operations subcommittee on environment, energy and natural
resources, told Army officials.
   The criticism came as representatives from the General
Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, detailed
serious problems with DS2, ranging from leaking containers that
were improperly stored to sales to private individuals who were
never informed of the hazards.
   In defense of their selection, Army officials said that unlike
the Navy and Air Force, the service's troops live in the field and
must take their equipment with them.
   ``This requires the availability of a decontaminant which can
effectively be used in an efficient and immediate manner in
locations where water may be severely limited in availability,''
said Brig. Gen. David A. Nydam, commanding general of the U.S.
Chemical Research, Development and Engineering Center.
   The military services have purchased about 5 million gallons of
DS2 since the early 1960s with the Army requiring the largest
amount _ 666,000 gallons at a cost of nearly $18 million.
   The chemical solution is manufactured by Dalden Corp. of
Roanoke, Texas, and Poly Research of Holtsville, N.Y.
   The GAO found that DS2 is toxic and highly corrosive and can
cause severe burns, liver damage and reproductive or birth defects.
Based on the problems, the Air Force and Navy have opted for less
toxic alternatives.
   The GAO found that at five of the U.S. facilities the DS2 was
improperly stored and in some cases, the cans were leaking.
   At Fort Sill, Okla., the chemical was stored with supertropical
bleach, a combination the GAO said could set off an explosion.
Meanwhile, at Fort Lewis, Wash., cans of DS2 were stored in a shed
without walls, exposing the material to the elements.
   Nydam said the Army was aware of the problem and was correcting
the mistakes at the storage facilities.
   The GAO also found that the Defense Logistics Agency sold cans
of the chemical to private citizens but failed to provide them with
Material Safety Data Sheets, which identify the health and
environmental hazards associated with DS2.

<HEAD>Congress Urged To Reject Time Limits For Reporting Rape</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Arbitrary time limits for rape victims to
report the crime would throw another obstacle in the path of
victims already reluctant to push the issue in court, witnesses
told a House panel on Thursday.
   ``I think we know it is a fact that many victims don't report
rapes for days, months, even years,'' said B. Joyce Dale, president
of The National Network for Victims of Sexual Assault in Arlington,
Va. ``I don't think you can possibly set an arbitrary time limit on
victims.''
   Testimony before the House Select Committee on Children, Youth
and Families centered on a continuing congressional debate over
whether arbitrary reporting deadlines _ perhaps 24, 48 or 72 hours
_ ought to be imposed on people intending to seek help under
federal and state victim compensation laws.
   Some congressional proponents of time limits believe such
measures filter out those who might lie about being raped to
receive funds for abortions. But rape victim advocacy spokesmen
said they believed the reporting and prosecuting procedures victims
have to face prevent women from crying rape untruthfully.
   ``In recent months, Congress has debated adding new hurdles to
the legal obstacle course that must be traversed by victims of rape
before they can get the help they need,'' said Rep. George Miller,
chairman of the House panel.
   Witnesses said the trauma of rape prevents many victims from
reporting an attack immediately after it occurs.
   Martha Zehner, who was raped by a co-worker, described why she
didn't report the attack.
   ``One reason was that I was too scared, and I was too much in
shock,'' she said. ``I couldn't believe this had happened to me. I
wanted to make believe it hadn't happened.
   ``Years later, when I had created enough emotional distance from
this experience, I could begin to understand what happened to me,
how frightened I was and really how ill equipped I was to deal with
it,'' Zehner said.
   According to government estimates, nine out of 10 rapes aren't
reported to authorities. Based on police reports, every hour 16
rapes are attempted and 10 actually occur.
   Experts report that an estimated 60 to 80 percent of rapes are
committed by someone the victims know.

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on Thursday told
the House of Commons that Britain was continuing to ``use every
contact and follow up every lead'' to help free British hostages in
Lebanon.
   But she gave no indication of any progress. She also avoided
criticizing Iran, which is believed to have influence over Moslem
fundamentalist groups holding captives.
   ``Any nation which has any information about anyone who is held
hostage should do all in its power to secure the release of the
hostages. That is the only normal, civilized behavior,'' she said.
   Answering lawmakers' questions, Mrs. Thatcher said it was not
yet ``right'' to resume diplomatic relations with Syria. Britain
broke relations in 1985, charging Syria with complicity in a foiled
plot to blow up an Israeli airliner over London.
   Iran severed relations with Britain in March last year after
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called on Moslems to kill Salman
Rushdie, British author of ``The Satanic Verses,'' which many
Moslems say blasphemes Islam.
   There are five Britons among the 16 hostages missing in Lebanon.
The others are six Americans, two Swiss, two West Germans and one
Italian. Longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.

<HEAD>Corn Planting Up 3 Percent for 1990 Crop, USDA Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn farmers have planted 74.6 million acres
for 1990 production, up 3 percent from last year's 72.3 million
acres, the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   The new plantings figures were down only fractionally from 74.8
million acres of corn indicated in a March survey of farmers,
despite delays in some areas because of wet weather.
   Soybean plantings were estimated at 58 million acres, down 4
percent from 1989, the report said. And that was down from the 59.4
million acres of beans farmers had indicated in the March survey.
   Cotton plantings, at 12.4 million acres, are up 17 percent from
last year and the same as indicated in March.
   The 1990 tobacco crop is being planted on 725,000 acres, up 7
percent from 1989 but down from the 731,000 acres indicated by the
March survey.
   Total wheat plantings were shown at 77.3 million acres, up 1
percent from 1989. The March survey showed total wheat at 77.6
million acres.
   The report did not include 1990 production forecasts. New wheat
figures will be issued by USDA on July 12, and estimates for corn
and other spring-planted crops on Aug. 9.
   Meanwhile, a related report showed the nation's corn inventory
as of June 1 was an estimated 2.84 billion bushels, down 17 percent
from a year earlier. Of the total, 1.62 billion bushels were stored
on farms.
   The use of corn in March, April and May was estimated at 1.97
billion bushels, up 11 percent from ``disappearance'' in the second
quarter of 1989, the report said.
   Stocks of old-crop wheat on June 1, the beginning of the new
wheat marketing year, were reported at 535 million bushels, down 24
percent from a year ago and the smallest carryover since 1975. Even
so, that was much larger than the 452 million bushels estimated
previously.
   The soybean stockpile at 596 million bushels on June 1 was up 28
percent from a year earlier.

   Soap opera star Susan Lucci remained a nominee
and not a winner Thursday as Kim Zimmer of CBS' ``Guiding Light''
won the best-actress Emmy and NBC's ``Santa Barbara'' was named
outstanding series.
   Talk show host Joan Rivers broke down in tears when she won her
first Emmy as best talk show host. Rivers, host of the syndicated
``The Joan Rivers Show,'' dedicated her Emmy to her late husband,
Edgar Rosenberg.
   Lucci, the Erica Kane of ABC's ``All My Children,'' has been
nominated a record 11 times and never has won. She was reported
filming an ABC movie, ``The Bride in Black,'' and wasn't at the
17th annual Daytime Emmy Awards show here.
   A joyous Zimmer told the black-tie audience she's leaving
``Guiding Light,'' in which she plays Reva Shayne Lewis. However,
she said without elaboration, ``I will be back some day.'' Her show
also won best-writing honors.
   ``Santa Barbara,'' which last year won a best-drama Emmy, took
home other major Emmys this time. In addition to outstanding
series, the show won a best-direction award and Emmys for the
actors who play father and son on the show.
   A Martinez, the Cruz Castillo of ``Santa Barbara,'' won
best-actor honors, and Henry Darrow, who plays his father Rafael,
was named best supporting actor.
   Julia Barr, the Brooke English of ABC's ``All My Children,'' won
as best supporting actress.
   Cady McClain, the Dixie Martin on that show, also won as best
juvenile actress, while an Emmy in the juvenile actor category went
to Andrew Kavovit, who plays Paul Stenbeck in CBS' ``As the World
Turns.''
   Thursday's two-hour show, broadcast by ABC-TV, was hosted by
Oprah Winfrey, a previous Emmy winner. Her syndicated show was
nominated for four awards but didn't win.
   Rivers, after accepting her first Emmy for hosting ``The Joan
Rivers Show,'' broke into tears into tears as she recalled her dark
days and a personal tragedy after Fox Broadcasting axed her
late-night talk show several years ago.
   ``Two years ago I couldn't get a job in this business ... people
said I wouldn't work again,'' she said, then alluded to the suicide
of her husband, a producer, in a Philadelphia hotel room in 1987.
   ``It's so sad that he's not here because he ... always said,
`You can turn things around,''' she said. ``And except for one
terrible moment in a hotel room in Philadelphia when he forgot
that.''
   She started crying. ``I'm so sorry he's not here,'' she said.
   A rival of Rivers' show, the syndicated ``Sally Jessy Raphael''
series won an Emmy as best daytime talk show.
   A lifetime achievement Emmy was given veteran game show producer
Mark Goodson, 75. His shows include ``What's My Line,'' ``To Tell
the Truth,'' ``The Match Game'' and ``The Price is Right.''
   Bob Barker, host of the latter, won an Emmy for best host of a
game show, an honor also given Alex Trebeck of the syndicated
``Jeopardy!'' for the second consecutive year. Trebeck's series
also was named best game show.
   In categories of children's shows, PBS ``Reading Rainbow'' won
as best children's series, and a CBS ``Schoolbreak Special,'' ``A
Matter of Conscience,'' won as best children's special.
   Best-animated program honors went to two ABC shows,
``Beetlejuice'' and ``The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.''
   The ceremonies were jointly presented by the Los Angeles-based
Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences, and the New York-based
National Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences.
   Nominees for prime-time Emmys are to be announced Aug. 2 in Los
Angeles, with the prime-time awards show to be broadcast Sept. 16
from Los Angeles by the Fox Broadcasting Co.

Thursday it will reduce its evening interstate long-distance rates
by about 5 percent and daytime rates by about a half-percent Sunday
as part of a $300 million overall price cut.
   The company also will reduce the prices of operator-assisted
calls, calls to Canada and its Reach Out America long-distance
calling plan.
   Overall, if the Federal Communications Commission approves,
interstate calling rates will fall an average 2.2 percent, AT&amp;T
spokesman Herb Linnen said.
   The company said it would eliminate the one free call now
allowed to interstate directory service, meaning all such calls
will cost 60 cents each.
   The cost of a 10-minute, direct-dialed evening call anywhere in
the country will drop to $1.49 from $1.58, or less, from 5 p.m. to
11 p.m., Sunday through Friday.
   AT&amp;T's prices have dropped nearly 43 percent since the demise in
1984 of the old Bell system, primarily because of FCC-ordered
reductions in local access charges.
   The FCC last week ordered the nation's local telephone companies
to reduce by $1.1 billion, effective Sunday, what they charge
long-distance companies to connect with local phone networks.
   Long-distance carriers typically pass along to their customers
savings from these reduced ``access charges.''
   Other long-distance companies, such as MCI and US Sprint,
usually follow AT&amp;T's lead in rate reductions.
   AT&amp;T, the nation's largest long-distance company, had announced
last month that it would cut its rates by $160 million annually
based on earlier requests that local phone companies had made with
the FCC.
   Local companies in April had asked to reduce their access
charges by $405 million on July 1, but the FCC last week increased
that amount to the $1.1 billion figure.
   Before July 1989, when AT&amp;T's earnings were restricted to about
a 12 percent rate of return on its investments, the company passed
on to its customers nearly all the savings whenever local phone
companies reduced their access charges.
   But AT&amp;T now is under a regulatory scheme that controls its
prices within a prescribed range of ``caps'' tied to the rate of
inflation, not its profits. Last November, AT&amp;T raised prices for
night and weekend calling by 1.3 percent.
   AT&amp;T's residential and small business prices currently are at
the cap, so this weekend's reductions were necessitated, Linnen
said.
   Large business prices are well below the caps, he added.
   AT&amp;T said it will cut prices for:
   _Direct-dialed, interstate calls between 5 p.m. and 11 p.m.
Sunday through Friday by an average of 5 percent.
   _Daytime (8 a.m. to 5 p.m.) direct-dialed calls by an average of
0.5 percent.
   _The Reach Out America evening discount plan from $8.15 to $7.80
per hour a month and the Reach Out Half-Hour plan to $4 from $4.35.
   _Per-minute operator-assisted calls an average of 3 percent.
   _The first minute of Canadian calls at all times.

   The shadowy, blurred image of Mayor Marion
Barry smoking crack cocaine in a hotel room is the latest in a
series of B-grade tapes produced by law enforcement agencies.
   The fuzzy, gray and grainy pictures of accused criminals acting
out the drama of a case behind numbers that tick off the date,
hours, minutes and seconds are not usually of high cinematic
quality.
   Even the owner of a home video camera can generally produce a
better picture.
   But the FBI, which recorded Barry's arrest in a downtown hotel
last January, and other police agencies operate at a distinct
technical disadvantage when they set up a concealed camera.
   The lens on a concealed camera must be very small.
   It's ``not the kind you have on your home video camera, a nice
big, large one that would be big and clear and treat light very
well,'' said one federal law enforcement official.
   The quality of the picture also depends on the lighting and
``how much time they have to set it up,'' said the official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   During the Abscam bribery investigation of the late 1970s, the
FBI concealed its cameras inside a television, said a former law
enforcement official.
   Since then, camera technology has improved, but concealment is
still the biggest obstacle to a high-quality picture.

   Two officials of the clandestine Roman
Catholic Church in China have been sentenced to three years in a
labor camp, Vatican Radio said Thursday.
   The report from Hong Kong said the two were picking up garbage
and cleaning latrines after being sentenced without trial on May
21. The radio did not identify the labor camp or say where it was
located.
   The officials were identified as Monsignor Peter Liu Guandong,
bishop of Yixian, and the Rev. Xu Zhemin, vicar-general of the
diocese of Baoding. They were accused of organizing and
participating in illegal activities, the radio said.
   Liu was earlier reported arrested during a crackdown late last
year on clergymen loyal to the pope.
   China broke diplomatic relations with the Vatican in 1957 and
allows worship only under the guise of the state-sponsored Chinese
Patriotic Catholic Church, which consecrates its own bishops.
   The church claims more than 3 million members, but an unknown
number of Catholics remain secretely loyal to the pope.
   Liu participated in a meeting last November that the Vatican
Radio described as the first gathering in decades of bishops loyal
to the pope.

<TEXT>
   As a special assignment for The Associated
Press, defending NASCAR (National Association of Stock Car Auto
Racing) Winston Cup racing champion Rusty Wallace reviews ``Days of
Thunder,'' starring Tom Cruise and Robert Duvall. The movie opened
nationally Wednesday.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By RUSTY WALLACE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   ``Days of Thunder'' is the best racing movie I've ever seen.
   It's realistic because actual NASCAR race cars were used in the
production, and the film relied heavily on real participants for
true-to-life impact. Much of the racing action came from actual
NASCAR races. The results are tremendous.
   Robert Duvall's performance was exceptional. Many of the
characters in the movie triggered almost instant real-life
parallels to people currently involved in the sport.
   The plot should be of interest to both racing enthusiasts and
non-race fans alike. There's action, humor, action, romance and
more action.
   The intense personal competitiveness found in our racing was
realistically portrayed. The competitive spirit off the racetrack,
and the importance of sponsors to the sport was accurate.
   One of the most impressive aspects of the movie was its
realistic portrayal of the camaraderie we have in the sport. Arch
rivals Cole Trickle (Cruise) and Rowdy Burns (Michael Rooker) help
each other during a crisis. It's a genuine relationship we have in
racing. We may strap on our helmets week after week and go at it
against one another, but we come to each other's aid in a real time
of need.
   There's a multi-car crash scene in the movie which really struck
home. Cole comes wide open through the smoke and gets caught up in
the crash. I faced a similar situation last year in a race at
Pennsylvania International Raceway. I crashed big time, too, but
luckily I didn't get hurt.
   ``Days of Thunder'' shows the fear and apprehension racers face.
It's something with which you live, rarely ever discuss and try to
keep in the right perspective.
   People involved with racing on a daily basis will probably feel
there's a bit too much dramatization in ``Days of Thunder'' because
of all the crashing. We do ``rub sheet metal'' a lot, but not as
much as is depicted in the movie.
   And the heat of the battle seems to always focus on only two
cars, but I guess that is the basis for classic competition.
   As for the added drama, my feelings toward ``Days of Thunder''
parallel what a real fighter pilot might think about the level of
drama in ``Top Gun'': Things tend to be just a little bit different
when you get a bird's eye view.
   Still, I can't wait to go back to see ``Days of Thunder'' again,
this time with my family. The next time around, I'll probably sit
in the back row and really soak it in. I'll probably look at it a
bit more critically and with more scrutiny next time.
   The Paramount Pictures release is rated PG-13.

<TEXT>
   Engineers who spent years designing and
manufacturing the mirrors now blamed for blurring the Hubble Space
Telescope's view of the universe scrambled Thursday to figure out
what went wrong.
   A team of about 40 people at Hughes Danbury Optical Systems Inc.
was gathering every document on the Hubble dating back to 1977,
when the company was awarded a $450 million contract to build the
telescope's precision optics.
   ``My understanding is that they will review all the documents
related to the entire procedure,'' said Thomas Arconti, spokesman
for Hughes.
   Hughes made the two mirrors that were called the heart of the
Hubble and which were cited Wednesday as the cause of a focusing
problem which has made the space telescope no more powerful than
one on the ground.
   National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials in
Washington said the flaw cannot be repaired from the ground.
   Engineers will install a correcting lens in a replacement camera
scheduled to be placed aboard Hubble by space shuttle astronauts in
1993. But the observatory never will be able to capture all the
spectacular views of the universe that had been expected, officials
said.
   Scientists are working on ways to salvage some research from the
$1.5 billion observatory, and a NASA team is being organized to
investigate the problem.
   Jack Rehnberg, chief of Hughes' space science office, said
Wednesday his company was prepared to cooperate fully with the NASA
investigation. He said it appeared that ``something inherently,
fundamentally was not done right.''
   Arconti insisted Thursday that all work related to the Hubble
was ``tested and retested, checked and rechecked'' with NASA
scientists. He said no one could pinpoint the problem until all the
documents had been examined.
   ``All of our test results met specifications, so that's where
the mystery lies,'' he said. He said a team of NASA engineers was
expected to arrive in Danbury soon.
   In the main lobby of Hughes headquarters, business appeared
normal. Employees met with clients and even joked occasionally
about the Hubble problem. One employee, who refused to give his
name but said he had not worked on the Hubble project, said company
morale was holding up ``real well.''
   Arconti, the only Hughes employee available to comment, said
news of the mirror problem ``naturally'' was surprising and
disappointing for those who had worked on the telescope.
   The Hubble Space Telescope was supposed to be able to see into
the outer reaches of space, at distances up to 14 billion
light-years, or 84 billion trillion miles.
   NASA Hubble scientist Ed Weiler said at a news conference
Thursday that a minute error in the curve of one of the two mirrors
is causing the reflected light of the stars to miss a precise point
of focus by only 4 percent of the diameter of a human hair _ just
enough to spoil the extremely sharp photos astronomers expected.
   Aside from the mirrors and the other precision hardware, Hughes
also supplied the telescope's fine-guidance sensors, which work
like an ultra-precise sextant to allow the telescope to literally
steer by the stars.
   Nearly 2,000 employees have worked on the development of the
telescope's optics since 1973, four years before Hughes _ then a
division of the Perkin-Elmer Corp. _ received the contract.
Perkin-Elmer sold its optics division to Hughes Aircraft Co. of
California last year.

   President Bush's call for a tax increase is
reigniting the partisan, rich-vs-poor battle that ripped through
Congress last year over the president's demand for a cut in the
capital gains tax.
   House Speaker Thomas Foley denied Thursday that Democratic
leaders implicitly agreed that Bush will win a cut in the capital
gains tax in the budget summit in exchange for abandonment of his
no-new-taxes campaign pledge.
   ``We are all interested in reaching an agreement, but there were
no preconditions and no agreements,'' said Foley, D-Wash.
   But supporters of the tax cut read Bush's statement differently,
and it has rejuvenated the issue which had been hovering ghost-like
ever since Democrats barely succeeded in blocking a cut last year.
   When the speaker and other Democratic leaders joined Bush
Tuesday in endorsing a statement that a ``tax revenue increase''
was needed, the next two words were ``growth incentives.''
   In the code of Capitol Hill, that almost always refers to a cut
in the capital gains tax rate which would affect people who sell
investments, such as stocks or a second home, at a profit.
   ``I think we should use the current budget negotiations as a
brand-new opportunity to put forward a pure, pro-growth capital
gains initiative,'' said Sen. Robert Kasten, R-Wis., said after
Bush's announcement.
   The Democratic Study Group, an organization which Foley used to
head, countered the Republicans with a letter signed by 134 members
saying that ``if the president insists that we need new taxes, we
feel they must be levied against... those at the very high end of
the income scale.''
   The rhetoric is a prelude to what eventually must be tackled in
the closed-door budget talks between Congress and the White House.
   The negotiators continued their meetings Thursday first with
discussions of possible cuts in benefit programs and Pentagon
spending, but recessed for the night with no decisions made,
bargainers said.
   Reducing spending on the entitlement programs, which include
Social Security and Medicare, is extremely sensitive politically
because so many voters could be directly affected.
   ``Everybody flinched,'' Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said to
describe the negotiators' reactions when those reductions were
discussed.
   A proposal to reduce military spending by roughly 5 percent next
year, to about $290 billion, was offered by Rep. Leon Panetta,
D-Calif. and chairman of the House Budget Committee. Talks on that
topic were to continue Friday.
   Bush maintained as part of his 1988 campaign that cutting the
tax would increase federal tax revenues by luring more people into
investments that help the economy to grow. The 1986 tax overhaul
had eliminated the tax differential on the theory that the economy
was best served by a neutral system.
   Democrats said Bush was trying a reprise of failed trickle-down
economics and when he pushed his plan last year they waged their
fiercest battle against the new president.
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., spearheaded the
debate and portrayed Bush as trying to further enrich his wealthy
friends _ an attack Bush later complained was too personal.
   The Democrats lost in the House but succeeded in blocking Bush's
plan with procedural maneuvers in the Senate.
   However, a clear majority in both chambers favored the idea, and
opponents including Bentsen, chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, indicated they could go along with it if it were part of
a fair package of deficit-reduction measures.
   Foley said Thursday he agreed with the position of Democratic
liberals, who point to statistics showing that the bulk of the
benefits from a capital gains tax cut would go to the wealthiest
members of American society.
   ``I think the ... position that they want to see tax equity is
one that I understand and support,'' Foley said. ``But that does
not say there is some kind of absolute condition on the specifics.''
   ``I think ultimately there has to be some type of capital gains
reduction,'' said Rep. Ed Jenkins, D-Ga., one of the Democrats who
voted with the president last year.
   Jenkins, a member of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee,
said he could support combining the capital gains cut with a rise
in the marginal tax rate for the wealthy. Under the 1986 tax law,
people making more than $200,000 a year pay less on each additional
dollar in income than do those who make half that much.
   One top Democratic aide said Democrats who fought Bush on
capital gains last year might be willing to accept some sort of
reduction if it were part of an overall budget and tax package that
forced the wealthy to pay more taxes, such as raising that top
income tax rate.
   ``I think the question is whether you can raise taxes on the
rich'' given Bush's presumed continued opposition to raising income
tax rates, said the aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
``Do you want to double what the rich are paying and then give a
little of it back... to finance a tax break for some of them?''
   Sen. Alan K. Simpson, R-Wyo., predicted flatly that a capital
gains cut ``will be part of the package.''
   ``A capital gains tax reduction can be well described in the
vernacular of a tax revenue increase,'' said Simpson, the deputy
Republican leader. Equity arguments aside, estimates show reducing
the capital gains rate would in the short term increase tax
revenues as people shift their money into new investments to take
advantage of the break.

   Know how fuzzy the world looks when you peer
through someone else's glasses? That's how the universe looks to
the Hubble Space Telescope.
   One of two mirrors that collect and reflect star light aboard
the $1.5 billion telescope was somehow built with a microscopic
error in how it focuses light.
   The surfaces of both the primary and secondary mirrors on Hubble
are perfectly smooth and both are curved to cause light to be
magnified. The problem, says NASA scientist Ed Weiler, is that
``one is slightly too convex or too concave.''
   This means that the curve of the surface is not aligned
perfectly with the curve of the other mirror so that the reflected
light collected in the telescope instruments is slightly scattered.
   The result is that the concentrated starlight has a slightly
fuzzy look. There are no sharp, crisp edges. It is similar to the
effect when a film projector is not adjusted properly.
   Weiler said the error is minute. The precise focus error is only
2 microns, a distance about equal to 4 percent of the diameter of a
human hair.
   But it's enough to seriously blur Hubble's celestial sight.

   Searing heat still gripped parts of the West and Southwest on
Thursday, and the usual summertime thunderstorms and showers
moistened sections of the South, the Midwest and the West.
   Phoenix opened shelters for the homeless and Southern
Californians headed for the beach Thursday for relief from the heat
wave that began at the beginning of the week. The death toll stood
at six in Arizona and California.
   Unusually high temperatures continued in San Diego County,
Calif. Heat advisories were posted through Friday for inland parts
of the county. Advisories to agricultural interests were posted
into the weekend.
   The temperature in Pueblo, Colo., hit 104 degrees, breaking the
103-degree record for the date set in 1888 and tied in 1963 and
1970.
   Early-afternoon thunderstorms and rain showers extended across
parts of Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Missouri, Illinois, Michigan,
Indiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered from the Virginia coast
through the South Carolina coast, across northern Florida and
southern Georgia, and along most of the Gulf Coast. Scattered
showers also fell in parts of Montana, the Idaho Panhandle and
Washington state.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT
included more than 2 inches at St. Cloud, Minn., where the rain
caused urban flooding.
   In Minnesota, morning thunderstorms brought hail three-quarters
of an inch in diameter to Upsala and 1 inch in diamater to St.
Cloud.
   Thunderstorm winds gusted to 60 mph at Lovilia, Iowa, and 65 mph
west of Gettysburg, S.D.
   Tornadoes touched down near Ackley, Iowa, and thunderstorm winds
gusted to about 60 mph at Conrad, Iowa. The twisters blew the roofs
off an apartment building and a business in Ackley, but no injuries
were reported.
   Thunderstorms insured a record rainfall for the month at
Minneapolis-St. Paul. The Twin Cities have received nearly 10
inches of rain, breaking the record of 9 inches set in June 1897.
   The nation's temperatures at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 59 degrees
at Quillayute, Wash., to 111 at Phoenix.
   The low temperature for the Lower 48 was 31 degrees in Truckee,
Calif.

<HEAD>AMA Doctors Speak Out Against Violent Rock Music</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHERINE SCOBEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Medical Association Thursday threw
its support behind voluntary record labeling by the music industry,
and declared its concern about the impact of destructive themes in
certain kinds of rock music.
   ``Just as we got into tobacco and we got into alcohol, we should
be in all aspects of preventive medicine,'' said James S. Todd,
executive vice president of the 290,000-member AMA, the nation's
largest physicians' group.
   At its annual convention, the AMA said vivid depiction of, for
example, drug use, demonology and racism could harm young people,
and urged the music industry to label its goods _ something it
already does, voluntarily.
   A statement adopted by the AMA's 436-member House of Delegates
reads: ``The vivid depiction of drug and alcohol use, suicide,
violence, demonology, sexual exploitation, racism and bigotry could
be harmful to some young people, especially vulnerable children and
adolescents who are socially alienated from traditional value
systems and positive support groups.''
   The music targeted includes heavy metal, punk rock and rap.
   The chairman of the committee that debated the issue said the
AMA was not seeking to censor, but simply to ensure that parents
know of possible dangers to their children.
   ``I wouldn't want us to be seen as moral arbiters,'' said Neil
O. Ward, an otolaryngologist from Phoenix.
   ``We're not wanting to dictate what's on the marketplace, as
much as to make people aware of the destructive themes and make
them aware of the dangers to family and adolescent health.''
   The move was lauded by the Parents' Music Resource Center, the
educational group founded by Tipper Gore.
   ``With the inclusion of the AMA we now have a very strong
message to the music industry _ that educators, parents and medical
professionals share a very valid concern about the messages
marketed to young people,'' Jennifer Norwood, executive director of
the center, said in a telephone interview from her office in
Arlington, Va.
   The American Academy of Pediatrics, which has 39,000 members,
adopted a policy last year asking the music industry to exercise
taste and restraint.
   But music industry representatives pointed out that record
companies already label music voluntarily.
   The AMA is ``a little late on this,'' said Tanya Blackwood,
spokeswoman for the Recording Industry Association of America,
whose members produce about 90 percent of the recordings made and
sold in the United States.
   In 1985, the recording association reached an agreement with the
Parents' Music Resource Center and the national PTA for voluntary
labeling.
   Last month, the recording association established a standard
label, also voluntary, that is affixed to the permanent packaging
on compact discs, records and cassettes.
   Norwood said she believes about 90 percent of the industry uses
labels.
   The AMA statement was adopted as the delegates wrapped up their
annual five-day, policy-making convention.
   Measures accompanying the statement call on the music industry
to label albums voluntarily and on the entertainment industry to
``exercise greater responsibility in presenting music to young
people.''
   But Blackwood said, ``We are being responsible in the fact that
we are voluntarily labeling products, and we've been doing so for
five years.''
   The doctors also urged parents to monitor the concerts their
children attend, the music videos they watch and the albums they
buy, and to discuss the music with their kids.
   And the doctors called upon their colleagues to be aware of
destructive themes in rock music and to work to heighten awareness
among patients and their communities.
   ``This is something broadly supported by physicians,'' said Ward.
   The statement and measures were adopted in a clear voice vote
and without debate. During discussion in committee, no doctors
voiced opposition, Ward said.

   Jurors in Marion Barry's drug and perjury
trial watched a riveting videotape Thursday showing the mayor
smoking crack cocaine and then being arrested by FBI agents during
a hotel-room sting operation.
   The fuzzy tape shows Barry twice inhaling from a pipe, and a few
moments later, agents bursting into the room where he had come at
the invitation of a longtime friend cooperating with the FBI.
   ``I didn't do anything,'' Barry said at first. Then, realizing
his situation, he muttered, ``I've been set up'' and uttered a
string of expletives at the friend, ex-model Rasheeda Moore.
   Barry, talking as much to himself as anyone else in the room,
repeated his curses and complaints over and over as FBI agents and
city police searched him and carried out other routine post-arrest
procedures.
   ``So what do you think about all this?'' one police officer
asked politely.
   ``I'm pissed off. I should have followed my goddamn instinct and
not come up here,'' Barry said. ``Simple as that.''
   As the videotape was played, Barry studied a transcript in the
courtroom. His wife Effi stared, expressionless, at a television
monitor. Moore, seated on the witness stand, viewed the tape on a
small television set nearby.
   Asked during a break in the proceedings how he felt about the
tape, Barry smiled slightly but did not speak.
   Barry attorney R. Kenneth Mundy began cross-examination shortly
before the trial adjourned for the day, quickly asserting, ``I
think she brought up the subject'' of drugs.
   Mundy contended Moore had cooperated with the government because
she needed money.
   The tape was the talk of the city where Barry retains
substantial popularity. It was played and replayed on local
television stations, interrupted only by newscasters' and
Washington residents' comments.
   The crowd around a bank of television sets at one department
store included Joe Perry, who sighed and said, ``He didn't want to
go up to that hotel room in the first place but he was so arrogant
that he thought he was bulletproof.''
   Three FBI cameras hidden in a downtown hotel room recorded
Barry's visit to Moore's room on Jan. 18 and his purchase of an
amount of the drug from an undercover agent posing as a friend of
Moore's.
   The tape shows Barry initially expressed reluctance to smoke the
cocaine unless Moore did so, too.
   She declined his repeated requests, saying, ``It makes me too
hyper, I get really hyper.''
   ``You do it,'' he insisted.
   ``No, I'm not doing nothing,'' she replied.
   ``No, you do it,'' he repeated.
   ``I thought you bought this 'cause you wanted to take a hit,''
Moore said.
   ``Aw, naw, you do it,'' responded Barry.
   But she didn't.
   At one point Barry said of a drug pipe, ``I don't know how this
work. ... I never done it before.'' But a few moments later he
walked over to a dresser, picked up the pipe, lit it and inhaled
the drug. He appeared momentarily wobbly. Moore was across the
room. Barry then inhaled again, and the federal agents burst into
the room moments later.
   Barry acknowledged a month ago that he smoked crack that night,
and said federal prosecutors were trying to kill him by providing a
potentially lethal dose of the drug.
   His lawyer contends the mayor was the victim of government
entrapment, a reluctant, inexperienced drug user on the night in
question.
   However, Moore testified Wednesday that she and Barry used
illegal drugs together more than 100 times over several years.
   Barry, 54, has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor
cocaine-possession charges, one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy
charge, and three felony charges of lying to a grand jury about his
alleged drug use. One possession charge stems from the night of his
arrest.
   The videotape was shown after a morning of testimony during
which Moore said Barry was reluctant to come to her room.
   In one telephone call between the two, tape recorded by federal
agents and played for the jury, he complained, ``There are too many
nosy rosies around.''
   The videotape shows Barry asking Moore if her friend Wanda _ the
undercover agent _ would ``mess around.''
   ``Yeah, sometimes,'' Moore said. ``She toots (snorts cocaine)
more than she'll do anything else.''
   Later, Barry said, ``Let's go talk to her.''
   Barry first gae Moore money _ she testified it was $100 _ to buy
drugs from Wanda after the undercover agent returned to the room.
The two went into the bathroom, and Moore emerged with a packet,
the tape showed.
   Barry only looked at the packet as Wanda left, saying, ``I don't
smoke no more honey.''
   ``You ... don't want to smoke?'' Moore asked Barry.
   ``Oh, just powder,'' he answered.
   But several minutes later, after Moore has said she didn't get
any new drugs from Wanda, Barry asked her to get the crack back and
provided her with $20, the tape showed.
   After debating about who would smoke first, Barry finally did
and was arrested shortly afterward.
   Jurors in the case also saw Barry attempting to rekindle what
Moore has described as a longtime sexual relationship.
   ``Can we make love before you leave, before you leave town?''
the mayor asked at one point. ``It would be a good idea just for
old time sake, you know, catch up.''
   Moore resisted.
   ``I can't caress your breast?'' Barry asked Moore.
   ``I'm serious,'' Moore said.
   ``I can't caress your breast?'' the mayor repeated.
   Moore testified Wednesday that she stopped sleeping with Barry
in June 1988 ``because there were too many drugs during that
period.''
   Before the phone call and the video recordings were played,
Moore testified that she is a recovering alcoholic and cocaine
addict. She said it had been only 45 days since she ``last abused
cocaine or alcohol.''
   She testified that Barry told her at one point he was addicted
to cocaine. She also said she was concerned for Barry's health.
   In an additional development, U.S. District Court Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson barred Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan from
the courtroom, saying his presence would be ``potentially
disruptive and very likely intimidating.''
   Mundy said he likely would appeal that decision on Friday.

<HEAD>Drugs Found at Home of Rock 'n' Roller Chuck Berry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. CHARLES, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A search of rock 'n' roll great Chuck
Berry's home turned up drugs and guns, authorities told reporters _
and Berry.
   Berry made a surprise visit to a news conference. He sat quietly
as officials recited a laundry list of items, including his
driver's license, removed from his estate in Wentzville, about 40
miles west of St. Louis.
   The estate was raided Saturday while Berry, 63, was away.
   St. Charles County drug agents found and seized several plastic
bags of marijuana, an unspecified quantity of hashish, two rifles
and a shotgun, $122,000 and pornographic videotapes, slides and
books, said county Prosecuting Attorney William Hannah.
   No charges were filed; Hannah said none could be filed until all
the evidence was reviewed, probably not before Tuesday.
   In an affidavit filed in circuit court, authorities outlined a
continuing investigation of Berry dating from December 1988. The
investigation began after federal drug agents said they suspected
Berry of carrying cocaine in his guitar case and briefcase.
   In March 1989, authorities at St. Louis' Lambert Airport
searched Berry's baggage but found nothing, the affidavit said.
   The investigation intensified last week when an informant told
authorities Berry had received a large amount of cocaine and would
have it at his estate for 10 days, according to the affidavit.
   But Saturday's raid found no cocaine.
   ``We would have felt better if cocaine was found,'' Hannah said.
``But that doesn't negate the search. We're going to look at it the
same whether cocaine was found or not.''
   Berry's attorney, Wayne Schoeneberg, questioned the basis for
the investigation and called some of the allegations in the
affidavit ludicrous.
   ``I have never used cocaine ... and nobody in my band has used
it,'' Berry, known for hits like ``Johnny B. Goode,'' told
reporters after the news conference.
   According to Schoeneberg, the affidavit also alleged Berry had
$36 million in liquid assets, of which $9 million was obtained
through drug sales.
   ``Where's the cocaine? Where did they come up with that? This
whole thing is a tragedy to me,'' Schoeneberg said.
   He said he believed the raid was connected to a civil lawsuit
filed in December by a former cook at Berry's Southern Air
restaurant in Wentzville who alleged Berry videotaped her and other
women in the ladies' room.

   Videotapes of a criminal defendant taking a
bribe, selling drugs or plotting wrongdoing are powerful evidence,
difficult though not always impossible to explain away, defense
lawyers say.
   The videotaped image of Marion Barry putting a makeshift pipe to
his mouth and smoking crack cocaine is just the latest in a series
of well-known undercover operations captured on tape for juries to
see.
   Prosecutors say such evidence is powerful because it puts
defendants in a defensive posture, trying to come up with an
innocent explanation for what jurors can see with their own eyes.
   ``Generally speaking, if you get the tapes on and unless the
defendant can seriously damage the tape (with other evidence),
unless the tapes are deficient, they generally work,'' said William
C. Hendricks III, former head of the Justice Department's fraud
section.
   The videotape camera was an effective tool in the Justice
Department's Abscam bribery investigation that resulted in the
convictions of seven members of Congress in the early 1980s.
   For example, a tape of Rep. Michael ``Ozzie'' Myers, D-Pa.,
taking a $50,000 payoff from an undercover FBI agent posing as an
Arab shiek led to the lawmaker's conviction and expulsion from
Congress.
   For defense lawyers, videotaped evidence poses problems that
``generally are momentous since it is the prosecution that is
staging the event in the sting operation,'' said Richard
Ben-Veniste, who defended a Philadelphia lawyer convicted in Abscam.
   ``At best, an appearance in front of a hidden camera by an
individual who later finds himself a defendant in court is
ordinarily not going to be a very pleasant thing to watch,''
Ben-Veniste said.
   But in a few notable cases, defense lawyers who challenged the
conduct of police or federal agents who ran ``sting'' operations
have won acquittals for their clients.
   Automobile maker John Z. De Lorean was acquitted in 1984 of
participating in a $24 million cocaine conspiracy despite a tape
showing him looking into a suitcase purportedly filled with drugs
and saying: ``It's better than gold. Gold weighs more than that,
for God's sake.''
   Defense attorneys put the conduct of government agents on trial,
eliciting admissions that an FBI agent destroyed potential evidence
and a Drug Enforcement Administration agent backdated documents in
violation of agency policy.
   The defense argued that De Lorean was pressured into
participating in the drug deal, claiming there were death threats
against his children if he backed out.
   ``What the defense can do is highlight the means under which the
recorded portion of the evidence was set up,'' Ben-Veniste said.
   As in the De Lorean case, Barry's lawyers are contending that
the mayor was the victim of entrapment. The tape of Barry's
encounter with Rasheeda Moore at the Vista Hotel provides the
defense with material for arguing the mayor was coaxed into smoking
crack despite his reluctance.
   In the Barry case, ``there is substantial ammunition if you are
dealing only with that incident'' that resulted in the mayor's
arrest on Jan. 18 in a downtown hotel room where he was invited by
a friend cooperating with the FBI.
   The defense will try to show that ``this was really the misuse
of great authority to utilize an attractive former girlfriend to
get an individual using a controlled substance that he had not
brought with him, that the governent supplies along with the
apparatus for using it,'' Ben-Veniste said.
   Washington defense lawyer Robert P. Watkins said he believes
evidence of police misconduct helped win a 1976 acquittal of a
former federal prosecutor who was videotaped taking money from an
undercover policeman.
   The evidence showed that the former prosecutor, Donald Robinson,
was having an affair with a prostitute, who was caught on camera
selling credit cards she had stolen from her customers to the
undercover sting operation.
   Robinson was lured in front of the camera and taped accepting
the money in return for a file on police informants.
   Despite this evidence, the tape was not enough to convict
Robinson, who testified that his wife had received threatening
phone calls.
   Watkins, who represented Robinson, said the defense produced
evidence that undercover police asked the prostitute to undress in
their presence.
   This evidence seriously hurt the credibility of the police,
Watkins said.
   ``It was a factor that didn't bear directly on the issue
Robinson was charged with but it certainly was, I believe, crucial,
in showing that these policemen were doing extracurricular things
other than just running a sting operation.''
   ``You have to embrace the tapes and then explain them away,''
Watkins said. ``That's what happened in this case.'' The defense
was able to answer the question: ``Why was this guy put in this
situation?''

   Jean-Marie Le Pen, president of the far-right
National Front, was charged with racial defamation Thursday for a
remark about ``international Jewry'' in a newspaper interview.
   No date was set for further proceedings in the case.
   Le Pen, whose party advocates deportation of immigrants, is a
member of the European Parliament. The current case marks the
second time his parliamentary immunity has been lifted to allow
defamation proceedings.
   Le Pen said he was being prosecuted for one sentence in an
interview published by the daily newspaper Present in August 1989.
He said that ``international Jewry plays a non-negligible role in
creating an anti-national spirit.''
   Le Pen denied the statement was defamatory and said it should be
taken in the context of the full interview.

   Convicted Nazi war criminal John Demjanjuk
should not be executed because sufficient doubt exists about his
identity, his lawyer told the Supreme Court in a final plea
Thursday.
   Yoram Sheftel, Demjanjuk's Israeli attorney, ended the longest
appeal in Israel's history by asking the panel of five justices to
overturn the death sentence because of ``lingering doubt'' about
Demjanjuk's guilt.
   Sheftel also asked the Supreme Court not to hand down a decision
before Jan. 1 in order to give the defense time to investigate new
evidence that might prove Demjanjuk's innocence.
   ``There is no case that potentially could contain a mistake more
than this case,'' he said .
   Sheftel said the justices should find Demjanjuk innocent, a
victim of mistaken identity.
   The appeal began on May 14 and included 13 days for defense
arguments and 12 days for the prosecution.
   Chief Justice Meir Shamgar said the justices would consider the
request to postpone their decision but did not indicate when they
would rule.
   Demjanjuk, 70, a retired Cleveland autoworker, was convicted and
sentenced to death in April 1988 for crimes against humanity and
crimes against the Jewish people. His trial lasted 14 months.
   The three-judge trial court agreed with the prosecution that
Demjanjuk was ``Ivan the Terrible,'' a Ukrainian gas-chamber
operator at the Treblinka death camp in World War II who raped and
beat Jews as they were forced into the gas chambers.
   More than 850,000 Jews were murdered at Treblinka in
Nazi-occupied Poland in 1942-43.
   A Ukrainian native, Demjanjuk claims he is a victim of mistaken
identity and says he spent those years in German POW camps as a
captured Soviet soldier. Demjanjuk changed his first name from Ivan
to John when he became a U.S. citizen in 1958.
   Demjanjuk's 24-year-old son, John Jr., said the defense hopes to
question a Treblinka guard who claimed in a 1979 statement to
Soviet investigators that the surname of the Treblinka gas-chamber
operator was Marchenko.
   Demjanjuk's son said the guard failed to identify Demjanjuk from
photographs. He said the defense just learned the guard is still
alive and lives in the Soviet Union.
   Sheftel argued Thursday that ``Ivan the Terrible is Ivan
Marchenko,'' a Ukrainian guard who resembled Demjanjuk.
   The claim was supported by two affidavits from a guard who said
Marchenko was posted with him at Treblinka and a deposition from a
liquor store owner whose wife was a prostitute who slept with Ivan
the Terrible, Sheftel said.
   The liquor store owner identified Ivan the Terrible from a 1942
photograph that prosecutors allege is of Demjanjuk, but said the
man in the photo was named Marchenko.
   The name Ivan Marchenko also appears on a partial list of
Treblinka guards compiled by Polish prosecutors.
   Marchenko is Demjanjuk's mother's maiden name, which prosecutors
claim Demjanjuk sometimes used as an alias.
   Demjanjuk was identified from photo lineups by Treblinka
survivors. He was also identified by Otto Horn, a German Nazi who
supervised Jews forced to take corpses from the gas chambers and
arrange them in a burial pit.
   Five Treblinka survivors and Horn testified against Demjanjuk.
   Demjanjuk was stripped of his U.S. citizenship in 1981 and
extradited to Israel from Ohio in February 1986.
   Demjanjuk was convicted in Israel under a 1950 law allowing the
prosecution of Nazis and Nazi collaborators. It is the sole crime
that permits the imposition of the death penalty in civilian courts
in Israel.

<HEAD>Colonel's Testimony an Obstacle to Prosecution of Jesuit Massacre</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a major setback to the
investigation into the slayings of six Jesuit priests, a colonel
has denied hearing a colleague was involved in the massacre,
judiciary officials said Thursday.
   Army Col. Carlos Aviles had been considered a crucial witness
against Col. Guillermo Benavides, a colleague who along with three
lieutenants and five soldiers has been charged with the Nov. 16
murders.
   Sources close to the case described Aviles' denial, made in
sworn testimony Wednesday, as a blow to successful prosecution of
the case.
   ``With the colonel's testimony, the case becomes even more
difficult. Based on the evidence we have now, I'd say there is
about a 10 percent chance of taking the case to trial,'' one
prosecutor said.
   The slow pace of the investigation along with the disappearance
of evidence and witnesses has been criticized by a U.S.
Congressional committee and officials of the Roman Catholic Church.
   Authorities say a military death squad went to the Jesuit-run
Central American University before dawn and shot the priests, their
housekeeper and her teen-age daughter.
   The U.S.-backed military at first denied any connection to the
killings, which took place amid an offensive by leftist rebels in
the capital. The military had said the priests were rebel
sympathizers.
   The case blew wide open after a U.S. military advisor said
Aviles told him on Dec. 20 that Benavides was involved.
   U.S. Army Maj. Eric Buckland, in sworn testimony, said Benavides
confessed his role to an officer who then told Aviles.
   U.S. officials say Aviles' information was directly responsible
for moving the investigation from detective work to the arrest
stage. All the named suspects are in custody except for one of the
privates.
   Aviles denied Wednesday telling Buckland that Benavides was
involved, said Violeta Lugo, a government prosecutor.
   ``Col. Aviles denied having any information about Col.
Benavides' supposed role in the massacre, much less having passed
such information on to the U.S. major,'' Ms. Lugo said. ``He said
he went to the U.S. major after this version of events became
public to rebuke him for involving him (Aviles).''
   Aviles gave his testimony to Judge Ricardo Zamora, who is in
charge of the investigation. Zamora on Wednesday issued a warrant
for the arrest of Lt. Col. Camilo Hernandez for allegedly taking
part in a cover-up.
   Hernandez allegedly ordered the burning of military log books
that traced the movements of the troops accused of carrying out the
massacre. Hernandez said Thursday he was awaiting orders from his
superiors before turning himself in.
   Hernandez said he was awaiting instructions from either the
defense minister, Gen. Humberto Larios, or from the chief of the
joint chiefs of staff, Col. Rene Ponce.
   Larios has repeatedly pledged full military cooperation with the
investigation.
   No Salvadoran officer has ever been prosecuted for a human
rights crime, despite the deaths of tens of thousands of people at
the hands of death squads linked to the armed forces and to
President Alfredo Cristiani's ARENA party.
   To date, the only evidence presented against Benavides has been
that of other defendants, which is not admissible in Salvadoran
courts. Two of three lieutenants leading the death squad said
Benavides ordered the massacre.
   Rightists considered the left-leaning priests subversives
because they had said El Salvador's decade-long revolution was a
war on social and economic injustice, rather than a reflection of
international Communist expansion.
   The massacre provoked an international outcry and calls from
some quarters in the U.S. Congress for sharp cuts in aid to El
Salvador, the largest recipient of U.S. aid in the hemisphere.

   The Army is thinking about trimming 7,000
civilian jobs, many of them in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Texas,
it was announced Thursday.
   The reductions would come mostly at installations for the Army
Materiel Command, which is the Army's largest civilian employer.
   The command is in charge of research, development and
procurement for equipment and weapons for the Army, its ammunition
production and storage, and the operation and maintenance of troop
supply and storage distribution facilities.
   Many more announcements of such relatively minor reductions in
the Pentagon's 1.1 million-strong civilian work force are expected
in the coming months and years, given the Pentagon's current
budget-cutting drive.
   ``These are proposed, not approved, reductions,'' the Army told
Capitol Hill lawmakers in a memo designed to inform them of the
possible move.
   ``In view of the continued decrease in military forces, plans
are being implemented to reduce appropriate civilian support
activities through fiscal year 1994,'' the memo said.
   The Army said it would inform lawmakers as the reductions are
approved.
   In proposals submitted to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney earlier
this year, the Army also has proposed cuts in its active duty force
that would take one soldier in four out of the ranks.
   Currently, there are some 2 million men and women in the armed
services and about 745,000 in the Army.
   In the memo sent to Capitol Hill, the Army said it recognized
the hardship that will result from the reductions in the civilian
job force and that ``every effort is being made to ease the trauma
precipitated by these displacements.''
   The three states that could be hit hardest by the proposal
include Pennsylvania, which leads with 1,122 proposed cuts,
followed by Texas with 1,006 reductions and New Jersey with 943.
   The reductions could be made on an involuntary basis unless the
Office of Personnel Management gives the Army the authority to
grant voluntary early retirement to older employees, the Army said.
   The proposed cuts announced Thursday in each state are: Alabama,
805; California, 268; Colorado, 95; Georgia, 68; Indiana, 6;
Illinois, 449; Iowa, 4; Kansas, 2; Kentucky, 447; Louisiana, 85;
Michigan, 535; Maryland; 84; Missouri, 565; Mississippi, 31;
Nevada, 17; New Jersey, 943; Oklahoma, 116; New York, 307;
Pennsylvania, 1,122; South Carolina, 95; Tennessee, 13; Texas,
1,006; Utah, 124; Virginia, 202.

<HEAD>Former Brockton Police Chief Sentenced in Cocaine Theft</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Barry Trial, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BROCKTON, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former police chief was sentenced to
seven to 10 years in state prison after pleading guilty to stealing
cocaine from his department's evidence room.
   Richard J. Sproules also was sentenced to a concurrent
seven-to-10-year term for embezzling city funds and to three to
five years on two counts of intimidation of a witness and one count
of attempting to procure another to commit perjury.
   Sproules, 46, is believed to be the highest-ranking
Massachusetts police officer to be charged with drug offenses.
   In a plea for leniency, Sproules told Plymouth County Superior
Court Judge Suzanne V. DelVecchio: ``My actions are inexcusable.
For all the youngsters who looked up to me, I'm ashamed ... You
look at me a ruined and destroyed man _ but there's no one to blame
but me.''
   Sproules, who had faced up to 35 years in prison, had originally
pleaded innocent to seven indictments.
   On Thursday, he pleaded guilty to the cocaine theft charge.
Sproules had planned to acknowledge there was sufficient evidence
to convict him of stealing city money, but not to admit to all of
the allegations. DelVecchio, however, refused to accept that plea
and found him guilty of the embezzlement charge.
   State police arrested Sproules, who had been a leader in the
fight against drugs in Brockton, in his office Oct. 24.
   The arrest shocked this city of 95,000 people 23 miles south of
Boston. He had been proclaimed the city's best hope in the fight
against drugs when he was appointed police chief in 1987.
   A grand jury indicted Sproules last year on charges of larceny
of cocaine, attempting to get another person to commit perjury,
obstruction of justice, larceny of more than $250 and two counts of
intimidation of a witness.
   The same grand jury indicted him on a charge of embezzlement
last March.
   No action was planned on the charges of obstruction of justice
and of larceny in excess of $250, said Dolores Sullivan of the
court clerk's office.
   The Norfolk County district attorney's office investigated the
case because Sproules and Plymouth County District Attorney William
O'Malley have been friends since childhood.
   Sproules' attorney, Bruce Edmands, said Wednesday they had
accounted for all but about $4,300 of nearly $200,000 Sproules
controlled as police chief.
   Sproules did not steal money for his own use, but spent city
money inappropriately on police operations, Edmands said.
   But prosecutors said in court Thursday that $74,764 in city
funds remain unaccounted for.

   Mueller will succeed Edward S.G. Dennis Jr., who announced
earlier in the day that he was leaving his post as assistant
attorney general on Aug. 31 to become a senior partner in a
Philadelphia law firm.
   From 1985 until 1988, he served as assistant U.S. attorney,
deputy U.S. attorney and U.S. attorney in Boston, where he had once
been a partner in a law firm.
   Mueller is currently an assistant to Thornburgh, overseeing
major criminal investigations, including the prosecution of deposed
Panamanian dictator Manuel Antonio Norieta.
   Earlier, he worked in the U.S. attorney's office in the Northern
District of California.
   A Marine during the Vietnam War, Mueller was awarded the Purple
Heart, Bronze Star and two Navy commendation medals.
   Dennis is a career federal prosecutor who has headed the
criminal division since 1988.
   Dennis said in a statement that he will become a senior partner
at the prestigious Philadelphia law firm of Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius.
   Justice Department officials stressed that Dennis's resignation
was unrelated to recent staff turmoil, which came to a head in May
when Deputy Attorney General Donald B. Ayer resigned.
   Nevertheless, two sources said Dennis had grown frustrated with
Thornburgh's management style, which had centralized decision
making in the attorney general's office.
   In a statement, Dennis said Thornburgh ``has provided
outstanding leadership to the department, and I am delighted to
have had the opportunity to work under him.''

   Bombs exploded in Beirut and two southern
cities Thursday, killing a 7-year-old girl and wounding 13, police
said.
   The girl was slain in a bomb blast that wrecked the first-floor
office of the pro-Iraqi Baath Arab Socialist Party in the southern
provincial capital of Sidon. Four people were wounded, police said.
   Iraq and Syria, ruled by rival wings of the Baath Party, have
been feuding for 11 years.
   An hour earlier, a car bomb exploded 400 yards from a Syrian
Army checkpoint in the Talel el-Khayyat district of Moslem west
Beirut, wounding six, a police spokesman said.
   The compact car, which had been parked in the street for more
than a week, contained about 66 pounds of dynamite, the spokesman
said on condition of anonymity.
   The explosion shattered windows, damaged apartment buildings and
set five cars on fire. It was the fifth car bombing in Lebanon this
year. By police count, two people were killed and 31 wounded in
earlier explosions.
   The third bomb exploded before dawn outside a PLO office in the
Palestinian refugee camp at Rashidiyeh, 50 miles south of Beirut.
Three Palestine Liberation Organization guerrillas were wounded,
police reported.
   The bombing came 11 days after guerrillas loyal to PLO chairman
Yasser Arafat cracked down on supporters of renegade terrorist
mastermind Abu Nidal in Rashidiyeh, leaving four people dead and 16
wounded.
   As is usual with bombings in Lebanon, there were no claims of
responsibility for Thursday's blasts by any of the armed groups in
the splintered country.
   There has been a chain of bombings since the Syrian army moved
into west Beirut in 1987 to quell militia anarchy. It has been seen
as a campaign designed to undermine the Syrian peacekeeping effort.
   Also in south Lebanon, police said one person was killed and two
were wounded in clashes between the Sidon-based Nasserite Popular
Organization of Sunni Moslem leader Mustafa Saad and militiamen of
the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army.
   The clashes around the hilltop village of Kfar Falous, east of
Sidon, flared intermittently throughout the day with mortars,
rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns.

   The manufacturer of a stomach reducing device
Thursday recalled 700,000 of the exercisers because of several

the company and agency learned of 62 incidents in which consumers
using the exercisers suffered ``serious facial or body injury''
after a spring or clip broke.
   The devices, sold nationwide from 1985 to December 1989 by mail
and in retail outlets, are composed of three 12-inch black metal
springs attached to a black plastic handlebar and footbar.
   The footbar, footstrap or handlebar are marked ``Made in Italy''
or ``Brevattato''
   Consumers should immediately discontinue use of the execisers
and contact Harrison-Hoge for a refund or credit toward other
company products, the agency said.

   A man who reported his 11-month-old son
had been abducted was charged Thursday with killing the child by
burying him alive.
   An autopsy found Michael Christopher Chapman died of
asphyxiation as he struggled to breathe and claw his way from under
several inches of dirt.
   ``He probably lost consciousness quickly, probably within
seconds,'' said Coroner Shirley Hofmaier, who conducted the
autopsy. ``And I hope that's what happened.''
   Peter Chapman, 39, of Germantown was jailed without bail, and a
preliminary hearing was set for July 5. Washington County Circuit
Judge James Schwalbach rejected a defense request to allow him to
attend his son's funeral Thursday.
   Defense lawyer Jerome F. Statkus said his client would probably
plead innocent to the charge of first-degree intentional homicide,
which carries a mandatory life prison sentence on conviction.
   Statkus said later Thursday he had withdrawn from the case
because Chapman lacked funds to hire a forensic pathologist to
examine the child's body. The court agreed to a public defender's
request to delay the boy's burial to allow for such an exam,
Statkus said.
   Germantown Police Chief Frank Riemer said no motive for the
killing was known.
   Riemer said it was the worst case he had dealt with in his 25
years as chief of police in the Milwaukee suburb.
   ``The other cases I've had were understandable,'' he said.
``This is not understandable.''
   Chapman initially told police his son was abducted Sunday
morning from his car outside a Milwaukee service station.
   But under questioning, Chapman changed his story and told police
he awoke Sunday morning and found his son dead. He said he
panicked, put the body in his car and drove until finding a site
for a grave.
   He led authorities to the grave Monday in a secluded, wooded
area of Germantown. Police found the child's body in a hole with
his head 4 inches below the surface and the rest of his body at a
depth of up to 22 inches.
   The coroner's report said dirt was lodged in the boy's esophagus
and stomach, indicating he had been smothered. Dirt was also found
in the boy's clenched hands, and the position of his head, arms and
feet indicated he was struggling to breathe and claw his way out.
   ``There's no way this is an accident _ not when you dig a hole,
put someone in it and cover it up,'' Riemer said. ``That's just not
accidental.''
   Sheriff Robert Shulteis, who supervises the county jail, said
Chapman was being kept in isolation after he was harassed by other
inmates.
   Chapman was not married to the boy's mother, Gina Godlewski, 24,
of Menomonee Falls. Court records show she sought a restraining
order against him earlier this year, saying he had a history of
physical abuse and ``looks at times like he's going to kill me.''
   A hearing over custody of the child had been scheduled for
Friday, court officials said.

<TEXT>
   Former President Nicos Samson, the
convicted leader of an abortive coup who has returned home after 10
years in exile, must serve the remainder of his 20-year prison
sentence, a government spokesman said Thursday.
   Samson was arrested Wednesday as he stepped from an Air France
jetliner at Larnaca airport and taken to the Central Prison in
Nicosia. He returned to Cyprus after a decade of exile in Paris.
   Speaking at a press conference, government spokesman Akis Fantis
said the deputy attorney general had ruled Samson, who was
president briefly in 1974, would have to serve the remaining 17
years of his sentence.
   Newspapers, however, speculated that President George Vassiliou
might pardon Samson, 54, a right-wing extremist, former newspaper
publisher and member of Parliament.
   Samson was considered by Greek Cypriots a hero of the 5-year
uprising against British colonial rule in the 1950s. Cyprus became
independent in 1960.
   He was sentenced in 1976 for his involvement in the violent coup
that briefly overthrew the late President Archbishop Makarios in
July 1974.
   The right-wing officers who engineered the coup with support
from Greek Cypriot supporters of union with Greece installed Samson
as president but he was forced to step down only eight days later,
after a Turkish invasion.
   Turkey continues to occupy 37 percent of the territory of the
east Mediterranean island.
   An amnesty was granted for all repentant participants in the
coup and the unrepentent Samson was the only person prosecuted and
jailed.
   In April 1979 his sentence was temporarily suspended so he could
travel abroad for urgent medical treatment unavailable locally.
Instead of returning to Cyprus, Samson sought political asylum in
France.
   Following his arrival at the Nicosia prison, Samson said in a
statement he had decided to return voluntarily.
   ``It is better to return and serve the rest of my sentence,
rather than stay abroad,'' said the statement, which was read by
his son, Sotiris.

<HEAD>Florida Governor Signs $3 Billion Environmental Lands Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CURT ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environmentalists hailed a $3 billion,
10-year program to protect Florida's natural spaces from rampant
development, which Gov. Bob Martinez signed into law Thursday.
   ``Probably for the first time in anybody's memory, the state of
Florida has placed a priority on land acquisition (and recognized)
that there is a need to preserve and conserve their lands,'' said
Curt Blair of the Sierra Club's Florida chapter.
   ``I think we're certainly on the cutting edge.''
   The Preservation 2000 law, which Martinez proposed, authorizes
use of $30 million as collateral for the sale of $300 million in
bonds for purchase of wetlands, beaches, scenic river areas and
forests. The $30 million would be raised by taxing real-estate
transfers and investments.
   The Republican governor signed the measure while on a
re-election campaign stop in West Palm Beach.
   ``Preservation 2000 is the most ambitious land acquisition
program in the nation and will enable Florida to lead the way in
protecting its environment for future generations,'' Martinez said.
   The measure includes a commitment to sell the bonds through
2000. But the Legislature must return each year to re-authorize the
$300 million bond sale.
   Martinez' original proposal would have authorized the entire $3
billion once the bill was signed, but lawmakers did not want to
give up their constitutional year-by-year authority over tax
dollars.
   Environmentalists, despite the prospect of having to fight anew
each year, acclaimed the measure as one of the strongest
commitments in the country to save land from developers.
   Blair said other states like California and New York have
similar programs but few are as large as Florida's, particularly if
the entire $3 billion is authorized to buy environmentally
sensitive land.
   Dominic Calabro, president of the Florida TaxWatch public
interest group, said the new program is good but warned that the
state must beware of cheats.
   ``We need to be very thoughtful and very careful as we purchase
these lands,'' he said. ``We must make sure they are the correct
and needed lands.''
   A state grand jury found recently that Florida often pays far
too much for environmental and recreational lands, sometimes
because owners overstate value, and sometimes because of a law that
lets the state pay 125 percent of value in some instances.

   A locomotive crashed into a train of
passenger cars carrying sightseers on a tour of the historic
Klondike gold-rush trail, injuring 40 people, officials said
Thursday.
   None of the passengers were seriously injured in the accident
Wednesday. All rejoined their tour group aboard the cruise ship SS
Viking Serenade in Juneau on Thursday, said Paul Taylor, vice
president of the White Pass and Yukon Route Railroad.
   The accident happened after the train, carrying 170 people on an
excursion trip from Skagway, reached the top of the 2,800-foot
White Pass summit on the Canadian side of the border.
   The locomotive was preparing to re-couple with the passenger
cars for the return trip when it apparently failed to slow down and
rammed into the cars, Taylor said.
   Thirty passengers were treated at the Skagway medical clinic and
released. Another 10 were flown by small airplane to Juneau, about
100 miles south.
   The narrow-gauge railway was built in 1900 during the gold rush.
About 70,000 passengers ride the train to White Pass annually.
   Taylor said an investigator from the Canadian National
Transportation Agency would arrive Friday to investigate the crash.

   A car bomb exploded Thursday on a
crowded street outside a police station in the cocaine capital of
Medellin, setting nearby vehicles on fire, killing 14 people and
wounding 30, authorities said.
   Four of those killed as well as many of the wounded were
children, Medellin Police Chief Col. Jorge Ferrero said in a
communique.
   No one claimed responsibility for the bombing, but authorities
blame the the Medellin drug traffickers for waging a terror
campaign of bombings and assassinations in Colombia's second
largest city.
   On Wednesday night, security forces deactivated a car bomb
loaded with a half-ton of dynamite in a parking lot near a city
government office building in Medellin, police said.
   In Thursday's attack, witnesses saw a man running away from a
compact car parked in front of the police station minutes before
the bomb exploded at about 11:30 a.m., according to radio reports.
   Police said the small sedan with false license plates was packed
with 330 pounds of explosives.
   ``We heard a tremendous roar,'' a local businessman said in an
interview with the radio network Caracol. ``Several people were
trapped in their cars and were burned up or blown apart by the
explosion.''
   Another unidentified witness told the radio network RCN: ``The
only thing I felt was a huge explosion that threw me from my car.''
   Associated Press photographer Ricardo Mazalan said that after
the explosion people were screaming hysterically, crying and
searching for loved ones.
   ``They've done me in! They've done me in! They killed my son!''
a man screamed as he dropped to the ground weeping, Mazalan said.
   The blast destroyed at least 10 cars and left a crater five-feet
deep and 12-feet wide, Mazalan said. It also damaged a number of
nearby stores.
   Four people were pronounced dead at the scene and the others
died in hospitals, Bernardo Guerra, president of the Medellin
government's Emergency Committee, told RCN.
   The dead included Miriam Nasa Sampayo, a reporter for the
Caracol network, a policeman, and the wife and two children of a
federal senator from Medellin representing the governing Liberal
Party, Ferrero said.
   Guerra said 30 people were injured, and many of them were in
critical condition. One of those injured was a policeman.
   The blast went off minutes after Ferrero was sworn in as
Medellin's new police chief at a police base several miles away. He
took over from Gen. Humberto Camero as part of a major shakeup of
the Colombian police force this month.
   Medellin, about 160 miles northwest of Bogota, the capital, has
about 3 million residents. It is also a major center in the cocaine
trade.
   The Medellin cartel has announced a campaign to assassinate
policemen. In April, the cartel offered $4,300 for each slain law
enforcement officer.
   So far this year, 150 policemen have been killed in the state of
Antioquia, whose capital is Medellin. All but 17 of the police
officers were slain in Medellin.
   At least 285 people have been killed in hundreds of bomb attacks
in Colombia the past 10 months since the cartels began fighting the
government's efforts to extradite suspected drug traffickers to the
United States.
   Colombia has extradited 15 suspected traffickers to the United
States since President Virgilio Barco ordered a crackdown on the
drug trade last August.
   However, the Bogota daily El Tiempo, the country's largest daily
circulation newspaper, reported Thursday that the Barco goverment
may have temporarily halted the extraditions.
   The newspaper said there have been no extraditions for three
months. It added that 15 Colombians facing extradition had been
moved from secret police headquarters to La Picota prison,
indicating they won't be extradited soon.
   The newspaper said Barco may have suspended the extraditions in
order to allow his successor to decide his own policy.
   President-elect Cesar Gaviria, who takes office Aug. 7, has
declared he would continue the war against the drug trade. However,
he has hinted he will not make extraditions a major part of that
war unless Colombia gets more help from the United States and
Europe and preferential trade treatment.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Buddy Roemer's office Thursday
received the toughest anti-abortion bill passed by any state in the
country, but did not say when he will issue his promised veto.
   The bill, which carries a 10-year prison term for anyone who
performs an abortion and provides no exceptions for victims of rape
or incest, passed the Legislature this week.
   Its supporters designed it as a direct challenge to the U.S.
Supreme Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision establishing the right
to an abortion.
   Roemer has repeatedly promised to veto the bill because of the
lack of exceptions.
   On Thursday, New Orleans Archbishop Francis Schulte and six
Roman Catholic bishops from Louisiana urged him to reconsider.
   Copies of a telegram from the bishops to Roemer were distributed
on the House floor by Rep. Woody Jenkins, the Democrat who was the
bill's author.
   ``Our state is the only one this year which still has the
opportunity to place the matter before the (Supreme) Court,'' the
bishops wrote. ``We pray that you will reconsider your announced
plan to veto the legislation.''
   Roemer has promised to meet with supporters of the bill before
he acts.
   He has until July 7 to issue his veto, but has said he will
allow the House and Senate ample time to attempt an override before
the legislative session ends July 9.
   Roemer and abortion-rights advocates have predicted the
Legislature would sustain a veto. The Senate passed the bill
Tuesday 24-15, two votes shy of the two-thirds majority needed for
a veto override.
   In California, the president of the Los Angeles chapter of the
National Organization for Women has said the chapter is drafting a
resolution calling for a boycott of all tourism and conventions in
Louisiana. The resolution would be considered at NOW's annual
meeting beginning Friday in San Francisco.

<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of workers demonstrated
Thursday in the industrial city of Brasov to demand more radical
economic reforms, and the parliament backed plans by Prime Minister
Petre Roman to introduce a market economy.
   Roman presented his new 23-member Cabinet, composed largely of
technocrats and experts, at a joint session of both houses of
Parliament. It includes few members of the interim cabinet that
governed Romania after Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was
ousted and executed in December.
   That government had been criticized for a lackluster pace of
reform and, in the case of some ministers, allegedly close ties to
Ceausescu.
   Roman, who also headed the interim government, was entrusted
last week by President Ion Iliescu with forming the new cabinet.
   In his speech to Parliament, Roman promised to carry out radical
economic reforms to deal with the country's economic crisis.
   ``The present state of the economy can only be overcome by
radical reform, carried out in quick steps,'' Roman said. ``Plastic
surgery and superficial adjustments of the old structures cannot
but deepen our crisis.''
   He said an initial package of reform laws would be presented to
Parliament within six months.
   He pledged to carry out ``the historic transition from a super
centralized economy to a market economy,'' saying the state ``must
abandon to the greatest possible extent its role as proprietor and
manager.''
   After the joint session, the two houses met separately and
overwhelmingly approved Roman's Cabinet and program.
   But opposition leaders _ who criticized Roman's interim
government for limiting private enterprises to a maximum of 20
employees _ remained skeptical that his current pledge of reform is
sincere.
   ``So far we've heard promises,'' said Radu Campeanu, leader of
the National Liberal Party, the largest opposition group. ``I hope
they come true, but I don't know, I don't know.''
   Meanwhile in Brasov, the country's second-largest city, about
4,000 workers staged a demonstration to demand more far-reaching
reforms, shouting demands for ``real privatization'' and ``freedom
and humanity,'' witnesses said.
   The demonstrators belong to a new independent union, the
Territorial Trade Union Convention of Brasov, which claims to
represent some 300,000 workers. Brasov, about 80 miles north of
Bucharest, was the scene of massive worker protests in 1987 that
were suppressed by the Ceausescu regime.
   At Thursday's demonstration, the workers also called for
``safeguarding our intellectuals and students.'' Earlier this
month, vigilante miners answering a government appeal for support
beat up students and other government opponents in Bucharest after
police broke up a 53-day anti-Communist protest.
   In the western city of Timisoara, public transportation workers
went on strike Thursday to protest their obsolete equipment and
lack of spare parts, according to media reports.
   In Bucharest, 300 students and several professors staged a
one-day strike Thursday to demand the release of student leader
Marian Munteanu.
   Munteanu was arrested June 14 on charges of ``instigation and
participation in violence.'' He was one of the leaders of the
marathon anti-government protest in University Square and was badly
beaten by the miners.
   The protests have been directed at Iliescu's National Salvation
Front, which opponents say is dominated by former Communists.
Iliescu and the Front won an overwhelming victory in the May 20
elections.
   At his inauguration last week, Iliescu vowed to remove
``disgraced, corrupt and incompetent persons'' in an apparent bow
to opposition demands for the ouster of those compromised by
serving under Ceausescu.
   The foreign minister in the interim government, Segiu Celac, who
in the 1970s had been Ceausescu's personal translator, was replaced
with Adrian Nastase, a former aide to Iliescu and a spokesman for
the Front.
   Retaining their posts were Culture Minister Andre Plesu, Defense
Minister Victor Stanculescu and Adrian Severin, the minister in
charge of Reform and Relations with Parliament.
   Doru Viorel Ursu was kept on as interior minister, a post he
assumed after his predecessor, Mihai Chitac, was ousted in the wake
of violence that rocked the capital earlier this month.
   Most of the ministers in the new government are in their 40s and
many hold doctorate degrees in fields related to their ministries.

<TEXT>
   Federal agents busted money-exchange houses
in eight Texas cities along the Mexican border Thursday and
arrested at least 19 people for money laundering, officials said.
   Authorities said the undercover investigation was the most
extensive yet of the so-called ``casas de cambio.''
   ``I think this will have a very significant impact not only on
the Texas border, but all the way to San Diego,'' U.S. Attorney Ron
Ederer told a news conference.
   The 21-month-long investigation by the U.S. Customs Service and
the Internal Revenue Service _ code-named Operation Vagabond _
resulted in 26 arrest warrants and eight search- and-seizure
warrants, officials said.
   Agents served the warrants Thursday at exchange houses in
Laredo, Del Rio, Eagle Pass, Roma, Hidalgo, El Paso and Brownsville.
   Nineteen people were arrested and checks totaling $290,000 were
seized, said John Alanis of the IRS criminal investigation
division. Other arrests in San Antonio were possible, officials
said.
   The arrests effectively shut down some of the casas de cambio,
although authorities did not officially close the businesses,
Ederer said.
   ``They were involved in money laundering in one form or
another,'' Ederer said.
   Undercover agents went to the exchange houses and offered money
for pesos or checks, telling the operators the money was linked to
drugs, said Charles Harrison, acting head of the U.S. Customs
Office in San Antonio.
   In some cases the exchange houses did not file currency
transaction reports required when more than $10,000 is involved,
Harrison said. And in some cases the money flowed out of the
country and back into the United States, he said.
   A total of $2.1 million in government money was laundered in the
undercover probe, authorities said.
   Ederer said he believes Operation Vagabond will send a message
to other exchange houses laundering drug money.
   ``The other casas de cambio are going to see what has happened,
and they don't know if this investigation (still) going on,'' he
said. ``There are millions of dollars being laundered in these
operations.''
   It is impossible to know how many casas de cambio operate along
the United States-Mexico border because the businesses are
unregulated and can spring up from the trunk of a car, Ederer said.
   In a hearing late last year in San Antonio, the U.S. House
Banking Committee heard testimony on the role casas de cambio play
in laundering drug money.

   ``I'll be God damned,'' says Marion Barry to
the FBI and to three cameras hidden in the bedroom and the
bathroom. ``I'll be God damned. She set me up. The bitch!''
   He says it again and again.
   He cannot accept it, cannot believe he is the victim of a sting
operation that, the government says, caught him on videotape
smoking crack cocaine in the hotel room of a beautiful woman.
   ``She set me up, I'll be God damned.''
   That is the absorbing part of the videotape that was made on the
evening of Jan. 18. Talk about the tape has occupied the people of
this city for five months, and it played on local television all
afternoon and into the night.
   The tape was prominent on all three major evening broadcast news
shows, all of which made the trial their lead story _ 2 minutes 10
seconds on NBC, 2:58on CBS and 2:30 on ABC.
   On this fuzzy tape, the criminal act _ if that is what it was _
is unclear. It passes quickly. What happened will be the subject of
courtroom argument.
   But what happens when the mayor realizes what's going on _ that
lasts for minute after tense minute on the tape. The mayor cannot
believe his fate.
   The tape is the centerpiece in the government's case against
Barry. Son of a Mississippi sharecropper, civil rights activist in
the 1960s, proud and popular in the nation's capital for three
terms, he is on trial on charges of perjury and using cocaine.
   By day, he lectured schoolchildren on the dangers of drugs in a
city blooded by drug wars; by night, the government has set out to
prove, he was a drug user.
   He has pleaded innocent to all counts.
   What the jurors decide that the tape proves could be crucial,
although the prosecution has plenty of witnesses to testify that
they had used drugs with Barry.
   One day ago, the woman on the tape, Rasheeda Moore, 39, sexy
magazine cover girl, the government's agent in the sting operation
at the Vista Hotel, testified that she and Barry used drugs
together often _ in 22 places and more than 100 times. She said she
even delivered drugs to him in his office.
   The tape was shown in court Thursday.
   It is flickering movie. For most of it nothing happens. Ms.
Moore wears silky pants and a flowing jacket. Barry's in a suit. He
takes off his suit jacket. He has on suspenders.
   A television set plays in the background. He paces. He sits on
the bed. He preens before a mirror. He gives Ms. Moore some money
for ``Wanda'' _ an FBI plant _ to make a purchase. When Wanda
delivers, they argue over who will go first and fill the crack pipe.
   ``You do it,'' he says. ``No, you do it,'' she says.
   It is done at last and it is smoked, apparently, and the FBI and
members of Barry's Metropolitan Police Force break in, running by
the cameras.
   ``FBI! FBI! You're under arrest! FBI!''
   They hustle Ms. Moore out.
   The mayor says he's done nothing wrong.
   He is told to put his arms against the wall.
   He complies, the severity of his problem sinking in. ``I
shouldn't have come up here,'' he says. ``I'll be damned.''
   ``How'd I get tricked into this stuff?''
   An agent reads him his rights. Barry has no interest. He is
still stung by the sting.
   ``That was a setup,'' he says.
   ``You have the right to remain silent...,'' says the agent.
   ``I'll be God damned,'' says the mayor.
   ``...You also have the right to stop answering...''
   ``...set me up.''
   ``...at any time until you talk to a lawyer.''
   ``She set me up.''
   The FBI worries about its suspect's health. He has been drinking
cognac. He has a history of heart trouble. They will take his blood
pressure and monitor his heart.
   He has no interest. He sits down.
   He curses.
   ``I shouldn't have come up here.''
   An agent: ``We'll just have them take a quick look at you, take
your blood pressure, your vital signs. ...''
   Barry: ``I'm all right. That God damn bitch!''
   The mayor asks for permission to call his wife.
   Not now, he's told.
   Another officer explains ``in deference to your office'' that he
will be taken down a service elevator. ``We're not going to parade
you through the lobby.''
   A judge will be asked to release Barry on his own recognizance
so he won't have to spend the night in jail.
   The medics get busy. Barry lets them do their work. He is told
body fluids will be drawn to check for consumption of drugs.
   Does he have chest pain? Does he have a headache? Does he have
any allergies? Is he allergic to medications?
   The mayor answers the questions but he is not interested. He has
one thing on his mind.
   ``I should have stayed downstairs,'' he says. `God damn.''

<HEAD>Steady, Undramatic Growth Projected for Western Powers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The West's major economies are expected to remain
on a steady course over the next 18 months, undisturbed by
political and economic upheavals in Eastern Europe, the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said Friday.
   The 24-nation secretariat, in its latest semi-annual report,
said the inflation-adjusted growth rate for its members is likely
to remain steady in 1990 and 1991 at 2.9 percent, down from 3.6
percent in 1989.
   Inflation is expected to stay unchanged at an annual rate of
around 4.5 percent in the OECD region through 1991.
   David Henderson, head of the OECD's economics and statistics
department, told journalists the ``orderly and undramatic
evolution'' of OECD economies contrasts starkly with the uncertain
reforms under way in central and eastern Europe.
   But he said developments in these countries _ with the exception
of East Germany _ aren't likely to have much impact on the OECD
economies. Exports and imports from central and Eastern Europe
account for only 2.5 percent of the OECD total, he said.
   The OECD report says fears that German economic and monetary
union could aggravate inflation ``may seem exaggerated'' given the
resolve of German banking officials to keep inflation under control.
   The OECD expects German inflation as measured by consumer prices
to rise to 3.3 percent in 1991 from 2.6 percent this year and 3.1
percent in 1989. Germany's growth rate is likely to remain around
last year's 4 percent level, but a deceleration to 3.4 percent is
projected for 1991.
   The report said the U.S. economy should settle down to a growth
rate of 2.3 percent this year and 2.5 percent in 1991, compared
with 3 percent in 1989 and 4.4 percent in 1988.
   Inflation is projected to rise to 4.8 percent this year before
easing to 4.6 percent in 1991.
   The OECD report expresses concern over the size of the U.S.
federal deficit, which it says could reach $135 billion in both
1990 and 1991.
   OECD officials agreed President Bush's shift in favor of tax
revenue increases has improved the budget outlook.
   The OECD said Japan's economy is likely to grow by 4.7 percent
this year, slowing to 4 percent in 1991. Inflation may accelerate
by about one percentage point to 2.8 percent this year before
easing to 2.5 percent in 1991.
   ``With the internationalization of the Japanese economy
proceeding rapidly, both further liberalization of the domestic
market ... and policies to stimulate competition are needed both
for the benefit of Japanese consumers and to avoid trade
friction,'' the report said.
   The OECD projects a steady decline in Britain's current account
deficit in 1990 and 1991, with inflation subsiding from the second
half of this year onwards.
   France gets a clean bill of health, with practically all its
economic indicators expected to move in the right direction while
growth continues at a 3 percent annual rate.
   Eastern European countries probably will have to rely on their
own austerity measures, rather than outside help, to finance
restructuring of their economies, the OECD also said.
   The organization said in its annual report on the region that
Eastern European governments must provide stronger incentives for
their citizens to save money.
   The flow of public and private funds into the region from abroad
may increase in coming years, the OECD said, but the broad economic
significance of these funds ``is likely to be modest'' and may not
offset the loss of Soviet energy subsidies.
   ``Financing of economic restructuring in central and eastern
European is thus likely to be dependent on strong domestic savings
flows,'' the report said.
   The OECD said private foreign investment is widely viewed as a
panacea for Eastern Europe's economic adjustment problems, but it
suggested this view should be treated with caution.
   The development of large-scale private foreign investment ``is
likely to depend on the pace of domestic reform processes in these
economies, particularly as regards the definition of property
rights, which remains a murky area,'' the report said.
   Except for East Germany, the report said, Eastern European
countries face difficulty obtaining more foreign resources because
their export earning potential is limited and existing debts
restrict their borrowing capacity.
   The flow of official government support is likely to increase,
with loans from the newly created European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development added to loans from the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund, the OECD said. But it said these sums
_ which could total $6 billion this year _ ``are small in relation
to potential requirements.''

<HEAD>Teacher Says He was Hospitalized Two Days After Beating By Gang</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A schoolteacher testified Thursday that he spent
two days in the hospital with injuries inflicted by a gang of
teen-agers in Central Park the night a female jogger was gang-raped
and nearly beaten to death.
   John Loughlin testified at the trial of three teens charged with
the rape and attempted murder of the jogger and assaults on
Loughlin and another man in a series of attacks in the park on
April 19, 1989.
   Loughlin said he suffered cuts on his head and his eyes were
blackened after he was hit with what he thought was a baseball bat.
Bruises covered most of his body, and he said he still has
``occasional throbbing pain'' and difficulty moving his right knee.
   He also said he was ``95 percent certain'' he recognized one of
his assailants later in a police lineup.
   The blood-splattered jacket and pants Loughlin was wearing the
night he was attacked were shown to the jury.
   Loughlin said he was jogging in the park when he saw what looked
like ``someone in trouble'' and stopped to investigate.
   ``I saw a person on the ground,'' he said. ``Around him there
were a dozen or more people who looked like they were attacking
him. ...
   ``Someone came up to me. He said, `What are you looking at?'''
Loughlin recalled. ``Then he called to some people in front of me
and said, `Here's one of those vigilantes. They repeated the word
`vigilante.' They were approaching from 10 to 15 feet away.
   ``The next thing I remember I was face down on the ground being
hit in the back of the head,'' Loughlin said. ``It appeared to be
something heavy like a baseball bat. I put one hand up to ward off
the blows, and I felt something hard and heavy and smooth.''
   After the beating stopped, Loughlin said he got up and walked
until he spotted a police car.
   The defendants in the trial _ Antron McCray, 15, Raymond
Santana, 16, and Yusef Salaam, 16 _ allegedly were part of a larger
gang that rampaged through the park, randomly attacking people.
Three other youths are to stand trial later this year.
   The jogger, an investment banker who was then 28, was
gang-raped, savagely beaten, and left naked and near death in a
puddle of mud and blood. She survived but suffered brain damage,
and prosecutors say she does not recall the attack.

   The pilot of an F-15 fighter jet did
not know he had a live missile aboard until he fired it at another
plane during a practice dogfight, causing nearly $1 million damage,
the Air Force said Thursday.
   The pilot was suspended from flying, and several other personnel
_ including the wing commander _ were transferred to other duties.
   The incident occurred March 19 while the two F-15s from the 21st
Tactical Fighter Wing at Elmendorf Air Force Base were en route to
the forward deployment base at King Salmon.
   The lead plane was carrying a practice training missile, which
simulates the weight of a real missile and remains attached to the
plane. The other aircraft was carrying one inert practice missile
and one armed AIM-9M Sidewinder, the Air Force investigation board
said in its report.
   They were doing some practice intercepts 180 miles west of
Anchorage when the second plane mistakenly launched the armed
heat-seeking missile, the Alaskan Air Command said in the accident
report released Thursday.
   The lead plane's pilot ``immediately pulled the throttles to the
idle position to cool the engines and increased the rate of turn to
the left'' in an effort to evade the heat-seeking missile. The
missile struck the left side of the plane's tail, and exploded,
knocking off the left horizontal stabilizer.
   ``The warhead severely damaged the right rudder and fragments
penetrated the external fuel tanks, engine burner cans and left
flap. One fragment struck the left side of the fuselage just behind
the cockpit,'' the report said.
   Lt. Col. Jimmy Harris, pilot of the stricken plane, regained
control of the fighter after bringing it out of a roll, jettisoned
the external fuel tanks and returned to Elmendorf.
   The missile caused $992,058 in damage to the $32.2 million
F-15C, the Air Force said.
   First Lt. Michael Lynch, who was flying the fighter with the
live missile, was grounded pending the results of a review by a
flight evaluation board, said Maj. Doug McCoy, an Elmendorf
spokesman.
   The accident report said although an entry ``was clearly
present'' on a maintenance log that is required reading for pilots
before takeoff, ``evidence indicates that Lt. Lynch was unaware
that a live missile was on the aircraft.'' McCoy said the command
has changed the way it moves live missiles from one base to another.
   ``We are still ferrying a combination of live missiles and
practice training missiles to forward bases,'' McCoy said. ``But
approval and training practices have been tightened.''

   Kneeling before an altar to the sun goddess and
sipping sacred rice wine, Emperor Akihito's youngest son wed his
college sweetheart Friday morning in a ceremony replete with
symbolism.
   The solemn 15-minute ceremony at the shrine dedicated to the sun
goddess Amaterasu ended with the symbolic sipping of rice wine from
a white ceramic cup, sealing Prince Aya's nuptial bonds with
graduate student Kiko Kawashima.
   Miss Kawashima, who has no royal background, has generally been
welcomed as representing another step in bringing the palace and
Japan's people closer together. She is the second commoner to marry
into the royal family. Empress Michiko became the first when she
and Akihito, then crown prince, wed in 1959.
   The wedding was the first for an imperial family member in six
years, and the first in three decades for a prince of Aya's rank.
Aya, 24, is second in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne after his
elder brother, Crown Prince Naruhito, 30, who has yet to marry.
   Clad in the black silk robe and cap with arched tailpiece that
designate him as an imperial prince, Aya and Miss Kawashima, 23,
walked to the shrine in slow, deliberate steps. An attendant
carried the train of the bride's green, maroon and orange kimono,
nearly a dozen layers thick.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and other government leaders and
imperial family members were among the 156 guests watching from
outside the wooden ``Kashikodokoro'' shrine.
   In the ceremony, the prince, kneeling beside his bride, made
vows to the sun goddess in the classical Japanese used by priests
of Japan's indigenous Shinto religion.
   Reflecting the royal couple's special fondness for Thailand, a
country they have both visited, Thai Princess Maha Chakri
Sirindhorn was also invited to the wedding, the first member of a
foreign royal family to receive such an honor.
   Aya's royal parents, in keeping with tradition, were absent
Friday morning, but like the rest of the nation could watch the
ceremony on live television. They will receive the couple later in
the afternoon in the Imperial Palace.
   The emperor was also to bestow Aya with a new title, Prince
Akishino, to mark Aya's establishing an independent household.
Akishino is the name of a town in western Japan with close ties to
the imperial family.
   Many aspects of the wedding ceremony closely followed imperial
traditions, some going back 1,000 years or more.
   Traditions aside, the ceremony was being hailed as the public's
first taste of the new imperial era, called Heisei or ``achieving
peace,'' which began with the death of Emperor Hirohito on Jan. 7,
1989.
   Akihito ascended the throne immediately afterward, and he has
been credited with trying to create a more open, softer image for
Japan's often distant and mysterious imperial family.
   ``This is the first big event of the Heisei Era,'' said former
imperial chamberlain Minoru Hamao, who served as a close attendant
to Akihito for 20 years.
   ``The princess is the perfect person for today's imperial
household, and I'm sure that as time goes on she will gradually
help bring the monarchy even closer to the people,'' he told The
Associated Press.
   Though Miss Kawashima has not created a sensation along the
lines of the ``Michiko boom,'' her warm smile and quiet,
conservative manner have won over much of the public.
   Because of her relatively humble background _ her father is an
economics professor at Gakushuin University, a former peers school
_ she was called a modern-day Cinderella by the popular media.
   She was also dubbed the ``Apartment Princess'' because she lived
with her family in faculty housing on the Gakushuin campus, where
she is working on her masters degree in social psychology.
   Aya, a Gakushuin graduate, met Miss Kawashima at a bookstore on
the campus in 1985.
   Soon after their engagement was approved by the government in
September, it was rumored that Aya and Miss Kawashima would
honeymoon in Thailand, a country Aya particularly likes.
   For the honeymoon, however, tradition has taken precedence. The
royal couple's first trip together will be to the Grand Shrines of
Ise and the tomb of the Emperor Jimmu, both in central Japan.
Emperor Jimmu, according to myth, was Japan's first monarch and
ascended in 660 B.C.
   Police say that because of threats from leftist radicals, 9,000
officers were assigned to guard the wedding activities, though most
were being held at either the Imperial Palace, which is surrounded
by a moat and forbidding stone walls, or the Akasaka Palace, the
well-secured residence of the emperor and empress.

   Country music star Willie Nelson will pay $6.5
million in personal and business taxes and penalties stretching
back to 1972 under a settlement with the government approved by a
Tax Court judge.
   Documents made available Thursday show Nelson was penalized
under sections of the tax code regarding negligence, failure to
file a tax return and failure to pay taxes.
   Tax Court Judge Mary Ann Cohen approved the settlement June 6.
   Nelson's tax trouble began in October 1984 when Internal Revenue
Service investigators alleged he owed $1.6 million in back taxes
for 1972 through 1978. In May 1988, the IRS charged he owed another
$9.4 million for 1979 through 1983. The IRS assessed hundreds of
thousands of dollars in penalties both times.
   The singer disputed the charges in lawsuits filed in U.S. Tax
Court in 1985 and 1988.
   Nelson's attorney, Charles Meadows Jr. of Dallas, said he would
not discuss the case. Nelson did not immediately return phone
messages left at his motel in Powell, Wyo., where he will perform
Friday night.
   Nelson is best known for his songs ``On the Road Again,'' ``My
Heroes Have Always Been Cowboys'' and ``You Were Always On My
Mind.'' He also performed in the movies ``Honeysuckle Rose'' and
``Barbarosa.''
   The tax documents indicate Nelson must pay $5.8 million in
personal taxes and a penalty of about $500,000. His music company
must pay about $139,000 in taxes plus a penalty of about $29,000.
   The IRS initially charged Nelson with civil tax fraud, saying he
understated his taxable income through unreported earnings and
improper deductions.
   But Judge Cohen assessed no penalty under the fraud provisions
of the tax code.
   Nelson's attorneys also successfully argued that his company was
not liable for about $728,000 in personal holding company tax. Such
a tax, at a rate of up to 70 percent, is imposed on undistributed
earnings from personal services.
   Nelson's attorneys argued those earnings were all distributed to
Nelson and members of his band. Most of the company's money comes
from royalties. Nelson established the company to meet a music
publishing house's requirement for royalty distribution.
   Nelson, 57, was born in Abbott, Texas, and grew up playing for
tips at central Texas beer joints and ice houses. He now lives near
Austin.
   He will be there next Wednesday for his annual Fourth of July
picnic, a tradition that grew from a 1971 reunion of Texas
musicians and now attracts thousands.

   Prince Charles fell from his horse
during a polo match Thursday and broke his right arm.
   The prince underwent a 45-minute operation under general
anesthesia to set two breaks above the elbow, said his spokesman
Dickie Arbiter. Charles was spending the night at a local hospital.
   The accident happened during a match at Cirencester Park,
Gloucestershire, seven miles from Highgrove, the country home of
Charles and his wife, Diana. Highgrove is 70 miles west of London.
   The princess was in London and decided to carry out a private
engagement there Thursday evening, but was expected to visit her
husband Friday. Charles' mother, Queen Elizabeth II, was informed
in Canada where she is visiting.
   Charles, 41, was playing for his team, Windsor Park, when he
fell from his horse 30 minutes into play.
   ``The prince was in the process of making a shot when he lost
his balance,'' said Arbiter. ``His horse just trotted away.''
   Charles, who once joked he would continue playing polo ``as long
as I bounce when I fall off,'' lay motionless for some time before
being put on a stretcher and taken by ambulance to nearby
Cirencester Memorial Hospital, a witness said.
   He spent about an hour in the emergency room with several other
patients awaiting treatment, police Chief Inspector Colin Handy
said. Charles was ``in very good spirits and chatting with staff
and cracking jokes with other patients,'' said Handy.
   A surgeon and anesthetist were summoned from a nearby golf
course to treat the prince. Rodney Sweatman, the queen's orthopedic
surgeon, arrived from London and examined the injury.
   ``The prince will remain overnight in a single room off one of
the wards and a further decision will be made tomorrow as to the
next move,'' said police Inspector Mike Pennington.

   NASA started a formal investigation into why
the Hubble Space Telescope was launched with a fuzzy focus as
scientists searched Thursday for ways to salvage some research from
the flawed $1.5 billion observatory.
   NASA officials said an investigation team, led by Jet Propulsion
Laboratory Director Lew Allen, was being organized.
   At the same time, engineers at a Connecticut company that made
the telescope's mirrors under a $450 million contract were trying
to find out what went wrong during a years-long process of grinding
and polishing.
   Terence Facey, an executive with the Hughes Danbury Optical Co.,
said that a study of signals from the Hubble has led to the
conclusion ``with fairly high certainty'' that one of two main
mirrors in the telescope was ground or polished to wrong shape.
   ``The shape is not correct,'' he said Thursday night, ``but we
don't know which one (mirror) it is.''
   Facey said that records still exist on the tedious three-year
grinding and polishing effort to make the mirrors and that Hughes
Danbury officials expect to be able to pinpoint precisely when and
how the mistake was made.
   Jack Rehnberg, another Hughes Danbury official, said earlier
that a manufacturing error was a strong possibility and that his
company was prepared to cooperate fully with NASA's investigation.
   National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials
announced Wednesday that either the primary mirror or secondary
mirror on Hubble were not focusing light as they were supposed to,
giving blurred and low-light images to the two cameras and three
instruments on the spacecraft.
   The flaw, officials said, cannot be repaired from the ground and
the space observatory never will be able to capture all of the
spectacular views of the universe that had been expected, although
a repair mission scheduled for 1993 may restore one camera.
   NASA Hubble scientist Ed Weiler said at a news conference
Thursday that a minute error in the curve of one of the mirrors
causes the reflected light to miss a precise point of focus by only
4 percent of the diameter of a human hair.
   That is just enough to spoil the extremely sharp photos that
astronomers expected from the telescope.
   ``The Hubble is comparable to a very good ground telescope on a
very good night, but it's not better than the best,'' he said.
   Weiler said the mirrors were tested individually before launch,
but never physically together as a unit because ``that would have
cost several hundred million dollars.''
   Instead, NASA tested the two mirrors together through computer
analysis, he said, ``but somewhere along the way something failed.''
   Despite Hubble's blurry view of the universe, officials at the
Space Telescope Institute in Baltimore hope to learn how to make
the telescope produce usable views of the universe.
   Ray Villard of the Space Telescope Institute at Johns Hopkins
University said scientists are recovering from the initial
disappointment over the permanent focusing flaw and now are trying
to find ways to compensate for it.
   ``At first there was a lot of shock about the defect,'' said
Villard. ``Now the wheels are turning. Some of the scientists are
looking for clever and creative ways to work around the problem and
do science.''
   Villard said the institute, which determines the scientific
studies that were approved for Hubble, is in the process of
completely reevaluating the 160 research proposals submitted by
international teams of astronomers.
   He said it was clear that a wide-field camera _ the major camera
on Hubble _ is virtually useless with the focus distortion of the
mirrors. Another instrument, called the faint-object camera, will
be able to do some work, ``but the images will not be sharp,'' he
said.
   Villard said the faint-object camera will be able to take
pictures in the ultraviolet spectrum, a part of star light that
cannot be seen from Earth.
   Two spectrographic instruments, he said, ``should be able to do
a lot of science,'' although in an inferior fashion. The
spectrographic instruments are used to determine the temperature,
motion and composition of stars. Data from these studies are
usually expressed as numbers and graphs, and not pictures.
   Another instrument, the high-speed photometer, will be able to
conduct much of its work, though exposures may take longer. The
photometer is used to measure the brightness of stars, search for
black holes and search for visible pulsars, an object usually
detected only by radio telescopes.
   A replacement wide-field camera is now being built at the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory in California and plans call for it to be
delivered to Hubble on a space shuttle flight in 1993.
   The Hubble was placed in a 381-mile orbit by the space shuttle
on April 25. NASA then started testing that was expected to take
eight months.
   NASA had said that the space telescope, orbiting far above the
obscuring effects of the atmosphere, would be able to see objects
25 times fainter than those seen from Earth. It was expected to be
able to look to near the edge of the universe, some 14 billion
light years.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Thursday
that Israel was willing to work with the United States toward a
mutually acceptable peace plan but warned cooperation had to be
tempered by Israeli security concerns.
   His remarks to a convention of the Jewish Agency came after he
sent a letter to President Bush reportedly proposing that
Palestinian peace negotiators be chosen on a name-by-name basis.
   Israel radio said, however, that Shamir's letter opposed the
inclusion of deportees or Palestinians from east Jerusalem as
suggested by Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   Baker has been trying to revive a U.S.-backed peace process that
stalled in March when Shamir and members of his right-wing Likud
bloc balked at Baker proposals aimed at getting preliminary
Israeli-Palestinian talks under way.
   At issue is the future of the 1.7 million Palestinians who live
in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, which were captured by
Israel from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Israel has proposed elections aimed at selecting Palestinians to
open talks on limited autonomy.
   Palestinians, who hope to create an independent state in the
territories, have called for an international conference.
   Palestinian leaders have also insisted that they be represented
by the Palestine Liberation Organization, which Israel considers a
terrorist group.
   In his speech Thursday, Shamir said that ``The U.S.
administration has to become convinced that we are sincere in our
hope for peace and the wish to continue with our peace initiative.''
   He added: ``In the end, we are responsible for our future, our
fate and the security of the state,'' he added.
   ``From Libya to Iraq, swords are being sharpened,'' Shamir said
in a reference to recent threats from the Arab world. He described
the PLO as ``performing exercises of deceit and terror.''
   Later, Shamir declined to answer reporters' questions about the
letter, saying: ``I want him (Bush) to read it first.''
   The letter was sent in response to a letter from Bush two weeks
ago that urged Israel's new right-wing government to advance the
peace process and requested answers to Baker's proposals.
   Under the U.S. plan, a Palestinian delegation would hold
preliminary peace talks with Israelis in Cairo.
   Israel radio quoted Shamir's letter as saying: ``We are ready to
continue to cooperate with Secretary Baker to advance a dialogue
with a Palestinian delegation that will be composed on a
name-by-name basis.''
   It continued: ``But as you know, Mr. President, we disagree with
the participation of deportees and Arabs from Jerusalem in the
delegation.''
   Israel television said Shamir ruled out participation by
deportees ``chosen by the PLO.''

   Wildly cheering supporters welcomed Nelson
Mandela to Detroit on Thursday after Cuban-American mayors in
Florida snubbed the African National Congress leader because of his
support for Fidel Castro.
   ``Right now, I wish I could climb down from the stage and join
you in the stands and embrace you, one and all,'' the African
National Congress leader told about 49,000 people at an evening
rally at Tiger Stadium.
   ``Your solidarity has given us enormous strength and courage.
... We will not forget you,'' he told the audience, which included
entertainers Aretha Franklin and Stevie Wonder and Detroit Pistons
Basketball star Isiah Thomas.
   Mandela, his speech shortened to 20 minutes after a day that ran
well behind schedule, closed by saying, ``I love you, I love you.''
   ``I'm just excited,'' Thomas said earlier. ``My hands are
sweating. He has such determination and drive.''
   Earlier, at a suburban Ford Motor Co. assembly plant, Mandela
donned a United Auto Workers jacket and cap as he addressed about
1,300 people.
   ``The man who stands before you is not a stranger,'' Mandela
told cheering auto workers. ``I am a member of the UAW; I am your
flesh and blood. I am your comrade.''
   UAW President Owen Bieber gave the 71-year-old South African and
his wife, Winnie, lifetime memberships in the union.
   ``I'm supposed to be working now, but I'm too excited. They can
dock me if they want,'' assembly plant worker Mike Hill, 39, of
Detroit said before Mandela arrived.
   After Mandela's speech at the auto plant, a heavily guarded,
30-vehicle motorcade whisked him away to downtown Detroit, where he
and his wife attended private receptions. He then went to Tiger
Stadium.
   Mayor Coleman Young described Mandela as ``a very human and
down-to-earth person.'' He praised Mandela for never abandoning his
principles during his long years in prison.
   As he stepped off the plane from Florida, Mandela shook hands
with Gov. James Blanchard, Young and Bieber, and hugged civil
rights activist Rosa Parks. Mandela, who was visibly fatigued,
rested for several minutes before heading off to the Ford plant.
   Detroit is the sixth stop of his U.S. tour.
   Before he left Florida, Mandela appealed for help from U.S.
labor unions. Outside the Miami Beach Convention center, black
supporters faced off with Cuban-Americans who denounced the South
African activist's defense of Castro.
   Mandela, deputy president of the African National Congress, told
the convention delegates that more money and support was needed to
force a change in South Africa's apartheid policy of racial
separation.
   ``Sanctions must stay in place until fundamental and
irreversible changes have taken place in South Africa,'' Mandela
told the delegates to the American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees convention.
   The 1.25-million-member union has contributed some $250,000 to
the anti-apartheid movement. Gerald McEntee, president of the
union, said a new fund-raising drive has been started to help the
ANC and South African trade unions.
   ``Continue to say no to apartheid!'' he urged the crowd, which
repeatedly broke into chants of ``Keep the pressure on!''
   He said the union's backing helped him win freedom after 27
years in prison for plotting sabotage to overthrow South Africa's
white minority government.
   The cheering warmth of the estimated 5,000 people inside the
convention center followed an icy reception from Miami-area
officials.
   Angered by his statements last week supporting Castro, Palestine
Liberation Organization head Yasser Arafat and Libya's Moammar
Gadhafi, mayors of the Miami area's major cities refused to greet
Mandela.
   However, about 2,000 supporters gathered outside the convention
hall and along his route. Mandela made no comment on the official
slight.
   ``To be welcomed by those who hold the reins of power in this
area, to be warmly received by residents of Miami, is the source of
great inspiration to us,'' he said.
   One supporter maintained that apartheid exists in Florida as
well as in Mandela's homeland. ``In South Africa, in South Florida,
there's not 20 cents of difference,'' shouted Leo Casino.
   About 300 anti-Mandela demonstrators, mostly Cuban-Americans,
waved placards blasting Mandela for his praise of Castro.
   ``Mandela is a traitor,'' said Ricardo Acabader, who wrapped
himself in the Cuban flag. ``I'm here to fight for human rights.''
   Police kept the two groups separated, although they shouted back
and forth with megaphones and at least one fistfight was broken up.
   ``In Miami, opinions tend to be very heartfelt,'' said Dade
County Commissioner Charles Dusseau, one of the few local
government officials inside the convention hall. ``That's why you
get this kind of reaction. There's been a lot of suffering on both
sides, and it's difficult for each side to understand the other.''

<HEAD>Committee Bill Would Require Sanctions Against Iraq</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: SUBS 3rd graf: ``The fate,'' to note administration
opposition</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted
12-4 Thursday for a bill that would impose sanctions on Iraq
because of human rights violations.
   The measure said the Iraqi government has ``systematically
detained, tortured and executed'' thousands of citizens,
depopulated Kurdish areas of the country and murdered and tortured
children to punish their parents.
   The fate of the bill in the Senate is uncertain. The Bush
administration has opposed the measure.
   The legislation would require the United States to oppose any
lending to Iraq by international financial institutions and bar
U.S. government credits to the country.
   That would cost Iraq $200 million a year in credits through the
Export-Import Bank as well as even larger amounts in loan
guarantees used to buy U.S. farm products.

   A firestorm started by an arsonist
destroyed 280 homes in this coastal community, officials said
today. Dozens more buildings were burned by windblown fires
elsewhere in Southern California.
   Thousands of acres were burning out of control today.
   ``The fire is incredible. It came down from the mountains. It
spread everywhere. It burned everything in its path,'' said Tim
Grasey, spokesman for the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Department.
   Throughout Southern California, fires forced thousands of people
from their homes, injured scores of firefighters and closed

   The Hubble Space Telescope is crippled by a
focusing flaw that may have been caused by an undetected
``prescription'' error during the manufacture of polished mirrors
aboard the $1.5 billion craft.
   NASA's announcement of the problem Wednesday sent a shudder of
disappointment through an astronomy community that has waited years
for what were expected to be unprecedented views of the universe
from the orbiting telescope.
   The space agency said the focusing problem in the Hubble mirrors
cannot be fixed from the ground and at least two of the five
instruments aboard the spacecraft will be virtually useless until a
repair mission is flown by the space shuttle.
   Plans call for such a mission in 1993, but the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration said it hopes to make the
flight sooner.

   City officials shunned Nelson Mandela
on his arrival overnight in Miami, where the South African
activist's embrace of Cuba's Fidel Castro has driven a wedge
between blacks and Cuban-Americans.
   Mandela, who earlier Wednesday laid a wreath at the grave of
Martin Luther King Jr. in Atlanta, arrived at Miami's airport just
before midnight to none of the fanfare with which he was met in the
four other U.S. cities he has visited.
   ``We do feel somewhat embarrassed,'' Gerald McEntee, president
of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal
Employees, said after welcoming Mandela. ``Embarrassed for the
state of Florida and embarrassed for Dade County.''
   A crowd of about 200 people who greeted Mandela outside his
hotel early today chanted ``Free South Africa'' and then ``Free
South Florida'' and finally ``Where is Suarez?'' _ a reference to
Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez, who denounced Mandela for his support of
Castro.

   Marion Barry slapped ex-model Rasheeda Moore
to the floor after they smoked cocaine, and he appeared indifferent
when she nearly passed out after a ``big hit'' of crack, she
testified at the mayor's drug and perjury trial.
   Moore said Wednesday that she and Barry used cocaine powder,
crack and opium more than 100 times in 15 private homes, a
restaurant and four hotels from 1986 to 1989. She said they were
lovers during most of that time.
   Moore depicted Barry as a man whose life was so consumed by
drugs that he had her deliver cocaine to him at the mayor's office.
They broke off their romance but continued to get together
frequently to smoke crack, she said.
   Prosecutors were expected to use Moore's testimony to introduce
as evidence an FBI videotape made last Jan. 18 when Barry allegedly
smoked crack cocaine while visiting Moore at a Washington hotel.
She was cooperating in an undercover sting operation that led to
his arrest that night.
   Barry, 54, has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor
cocaine-possession charges, one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy
charge, and three felony charges of lying to a grand jury about his
alleged drug use. One possession charge stems from the night of his
arrest.

   The withdrawal of Peace Corps
volunteers highlights the vulnerability of the estimated 140,000
Americans in this country as they become steadily drawn into its
21-year-old Communist insurgency.
   U.S. officials announced Wednesday that they were suspending
Peace Corps operations in the Philippines and sending the 261
volunteers home because of intelligence reports that Communist
rebels planned to kill or kidnap them.
   Volunteers were to begin leaving by commercial flights after a
farewell reception today hosted by President Corazon Aquino.
   American officials refuse to elaborate on the reported rebel
threat. But the decision to evacuate volunteers shows that U.S.
diplomats take it seriously.

   Soldiers wearing masks and civilian
clothes fired on mourners carrying the coffin of a slain Communist
rebel Thursday. President Corazon Aquino bade farewell to hundreds
of American Peace Corps volunteers.
   The soldiers killed two people and arrested 21 others. They
later forced cemetery workers to bury the rebel, whose coffin was
dropped as pall bearers and other mourners fled the shooting.
   The attack illustrated the pattern of violence that prompted the
decision to suspend Peace Corps operations and led the U.S. Embassy
to warn Americans to take extra safety precautions.
   Mrs. Aquino addressed Peace Corps members one day after U.S.

<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ever wonder what network news anchors and talk
show hosts do when they aren't interviewing people? By golly, they
get interviewed on talk or variety shows, that's what they do.
   Consider: Next Friday, Larry King, who has a CNN talk show, will
talk on NBC's ``Tonight Show.'' On July 13, Jane Pauley will be on
NBC's ``Late Night With David Letterman,'' where she has appeared
before.
   Deborah Norville, who succeeded her on ``Today,'' also has been
on ``Letterman.'' So have such newsguests as Tom Brokaw, John
Chancellor, Connie Chung, Sam Donaldson and Maria Shriver.
   This month, Norville appeared on ``Tonight.'' So did ABC's Peter
Jennings, although on a different evening. CBS' Dan Rather,
meanwhile, was seen in a two-part interview on NBC's ``Later With
Bob Costas.''
   The network newsies for years have been interviewed by print
reporters who grill them on the state of themselves, their shows
and even the cosmos.
   But the appearances of network news stars on talk shows are on
the rise and represent a form of cannibalism, says Reuven Frank,
president of NBC News in 1968-73 and again in 1982-84.
   ``It also is very new,'' he says. Thirty years ago, Frank says,
``it was really a big deal when a main news type would get on an
interview show.''
   He recalls the time it took a direct order to the news division
from Robert Kintner, then president of NBC, to put Chet Huntley and
David Brinkley, co-anchors of ``The Huntley-Brinkley Report,'' on
the ``Tonight Show.''
   Now, no orders are needed. An invitation arrives, the newsfolk
go.
   Why?
   ``I don't know,'' Frank says. ``It's `What is so-and-so really
like?' It's that game.''
   Costas, whose background is sports, not news, was himself
interviewed this year on CBNC's ``The Dick Cavett Show.'' But TV's
news stars don't tend to go to that show. They gravitate to Costas'
half-hour ``Later,'' which has become a second home of sorts for
them.
   In addition to Rather, who first went there in 1988, ``Later''
guests have included Brokaw, Linda Ellerbee, Mike Wallace, Walter
Cronkite, Pauley, Jennings, Ted Koppel, Pierre Salinger and
Kathleen Sullivan.
   Chung also was a guest in a two-part interview in September 1989
when her ``Saturday Night With Connie Chung'' was just starting.
   The first interview was with her. The second show featured Chung
and her husband, ``A Current Affair'' anchorman Maury Povich.
   But Costas doesn't get everyone. It took Barbara Walters, former
co-host of ``Today,'' to land an interview with Bryant Gumbel of
``Today.'' That chat, about the show's woes, was broadcast in March
on ABC's ``20-20.''
   A month later, the syndicated ``Live With Regis &amp; Kathie Lee''
landed an interview with ABC's Diane Sawyer, who talked about her
upcoming exclusive interview of Marla Maples for ``PrimeTime Live.''
   (Maples is a friend of Donald Trump, diplomatic observers say.)
   Pickings apparently get so lean at times that TV stars interview
each other. This has happened at least twice so far this year.
   Talk show star Phil Donahue _ who has been interviewed on
Costas' show _ interviewed talk show star Joan Rivers on his show.
In due course, Donahue was interviewed by her on her first show in
New York.
   In May, Chung was interviewed by Arsenio Hall on his syndicated
show. Three nights later, her ``Face to Face With Connie Chung''
special featured her taped interview with ... Arsenio Hall.
   It isn't necessarily bad that a TV news star appears on a talk
or variety show, provided he or she does it with dignity, says
Everette C. Dennis, executive director of the Gannett Center for
Media Studies.
   That such appearances are common now but once were rare is due
to changing times and managements at the networks, he says.
Networks once considered their news divisions as prestigious loss
leaders.
   Now, they want the divisions to turn a profit, he says, and
``this means they have to court the audience. And to some extent,
it's a pretty brazen courtship.''
   For the network anchors and star correspondents, the aim of the
game is publicity for their news programs. The hope is that if
viewers find the news types interesting and likeable, they'll tune
in their shows.
   ``It doesn't stay just on `Watch me in my job and see how well I
do,''' Dennis says. ``Now, it's `Gosh, if you've never heard of me,
watch me on the talk show tonight. You might like me.' ''
   Former NBC News chief Frank is more amused than alarmed about
the trend.
   ``It's very silly,'' he says. ``Here are these guys who do
nothing but talk on their own shows, and they have to go to another
show to talk. I think we ought to get 'em a 900 number they can
call to talk.''
   Is America doomed to even more Anchorama?
   Frank sighed. ``I've come to assume that reason will never set
in,'' he says. ``But it's another fad, and it will burn itself out.
And they'll get somebody more interesting _ like experts.''

<HEAD>A Tax Increase? Not Necessarily</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When communicating about taxes, elected
officials are at their subtle best. Some ask that you read their
lips, some speak from both corners of the mouth, and many find
refuge in semantics.
   In the past, presidents have raised revenues without ever using
the word ``tax,'' choosing instead such terms as user fees and
surcharges, or by closing loopholes, by stricter enforcement or
expanded collection efforts.
   In his statement on reducing the budget deficit, President Bush
did not mention tax increases. He chose instead to say that he
would seek ``tax revenue increases,'' a term that could have
considerable significance.
   It is the contention of some tax authorities, for example, that
it is possible to raise tax revenues while reducing taxes, as on
capital gains. That argument is, in fact, a particular favorite of
White House advisers.
   Their thesis is this:
   When taxes are high on capital gains _ which are long-term
profits from such matters as real estate and stock market
transactions _ tax-producing activity is restrained. Rather than
sell and pay taxes, investors simply stay put.
   The way to get these people to sell is to make it less onerous
for them to do so. Lower the tax, these advisers say, and you will
almost automatically release a rush of activity. Revenue would pour
into Uncle Sam's pockets.
   True, the revenue per transaction would be lower than before,
but everyone from the newspaper vendor to Donald Trump knows that
you might make it up, and more, in volume. Harvard professors say
so; so does Bush.
   In fact, Bush has been as consistent in pushing for a capital
gains tax reduction as he has been in saying no more taxes. He made
it a plank in his election platform and has reiterated it since.
   In order to obtain it from Congress, however, he might have to
submit to pressures for higher taxes on such items as gasoline and
cigarettes. This, of course, would be interpreted as weak-kneed
reneging on his no-tax pledge.
   No good politician would submit to that humiliation without a
comeback, and Bush has one. To his critics he might point out that
the tax decrease he obtained more than offset the increased taxes
in other areas.
   In that sense, he might say that while the revenue mix did
indeed change, the net effect was that one move nullified the other
or even resulted in lower taxes. Thus, no NET tax increase,
although perhaps a revenue increase.
   Nevertheless, any change in the tax situation is bound to bring
out the critics, and some of them are likely to be formerly strong
supporters. Analysts at the Heritage Foundation, a think tank
highly influential in both the Reagan and Bush administration,
already have released blasts.
   The general feeling among conservative analysts, such as those
at Heritage, is that by various measures taxes are near their
all-time highs, and that wasteful spending is too. Don't raise
taxes, they say, cut spending instead.
   They've identified what they say are $130 billion in spending
cuts and budget savings that could be made without damaging the
social benefits safety net.
   In no way, they say, would those savings come at the expense of
the poor, no matter what members of Congress might say. Those
savings might, however, come at the expense of the members' pet
projects.
   Analyst Scott Hodge indicates that hardly a spending bill is
passed that doesn't contain a tail of pork, an additional sum to
satisfy their special interest or that of a constituent.
   Unsubtly, he directly blames Congress for squandering billions
and states that ``taxpayers should no longer have to pinch pennies
so that Congress can spend them with abandon.''
   That suggests to the president a final fallback position: If he
has to accept the damage to his reputation, if he has to accept a
tax increase, he can at least say he did his best but that Congress
forced him into it.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twice a week, clad in a filmy purple gown,
wearing deathly white makeup and a heavy black wig, Lee Meriwether
stands outside a sound stage and waves at the passing trams of the
Universal Studios Tour.
   This is not a common occurrence on the tour _ few well-known
actors deign to make an appearance. But Meriwether, star of the
syndicated program ``The Munsters Today,'' enjoys the attention.
   ``It started when I was standing outside the stage one day when
a tram came by. ... The tour guide told them who I was. I waved at
them and they got a kick out of it,'' she said.
   ``One day, a tram load of Japanese tourists came by and nearly
tilted over as everyone rushed to the side to take pictures,'' said
Meriwether. ``I wish I'd had a camera to take a picture of that.''
   Meriwether is now at work on the third season of ``The Munsters
Today,'' a revival of the 1960s comedy series. The original was
something of a copy itself, coming as it did on the heels of the
popular show ``The Addams Family. It was then, and still is, a
spoof of domestic family sitcoms.
   The Munsters live at 1313 Mockingbird Lane in a musty Gothic
mansion. Each member of the family looks like a refugee from a
horror flick.
   Herman, the father, is a gravedigger and dead ringer for
Frankenstein's monster. Grandpa, who looks like Dracula, tinkers
with inventions in the basement.
   The children are Eddie, a teen-ager who seems to be on his way
to turning into a werewolf, and Marilyn, a pretty young woman. In
the original show, the rest of the Munsters thought Marilyn was
abnormal, and pitied her.
   Meriwether's Lily is a vampire. ``Lily is basically your
everyday mother in a sitcom,'' said Meriwether, who was Miss
America in 1955. ``She adores her children. She just looks
different.''
   The actress revels in the show's monsterisms. When she found a
Transylvania cookbook, she bought dozens and gave them to friends.
   ``The show has been brought up to date,'' Meriwether said. ``The
children have changed the most. Eddie no longer dresses in the
Little Lord Fauntleroy clothes. He dresses as other teens do today.
We no longer worry about Marilyn's looks. ... There was some talk
that I would get a job.''
   The series features John Schuck as Herman, Howard Morton as
Grandpa, Jason Marsden as Eddie and Hillary Van Dyke as Marilyn.
The original show, broadcast on CBS from 1964-66, starred Fred
Gwynne as Herman, Yvonne DeCarlo as Lily, Al Lewis as Grandpa,
Butch Patrick as Eddie and Beverly Owen and later Pat Priest as
Marilyn.
   Meriwether did not give ``The Munsters Today'' much chance for
survival.
   First, she said, ``I thought it would be just a pilot. I never
thought it would become a series. Then I didn't think it would go
beyond the first year.''
   It is now seen on more than 100 stations.
   Meriwether is a television veteran; she had recurring roles on
``Mission: Impossible,'' ``Dr. Kildare,'' ``The FBI'' and ``12
O'Clock High,'' as well as ``The Time Tunnel,'' ``The New Andy
Griffith Show'' and ``Barnaby Jones.''
   In the last show, she played Betty Jones, the daughter-in-law of
the eponymous character played by Buddy Ebsen. That show originally
was an episode of ``Cannon,'' but before they had completed the
filming it became a spinoff and a new series. It ran for eight
seasons on CBS.
   After ``Barnaby Jones'' left the air in 1980, she did mostly
stage work and spent five years as an aerialist with circuses in
Switzerland, Sweden, Japan, Australia and South America. She worked
as a substitute with the Flying Gaonas, and her daughter Lesley
Aletter often worked with her.
   ``I wasn't a gymnast,'' said Meriwether. ``I did the simple
tricks, but Lesley could do the unusual tricks.''
   Lesley currently works as a film editor; another daughter, Kyle
Aletter, is an actress. Meriwether is married to Marshall Borden,
an actor, writer and director, and they frequently have worked
together in regional theater.

<HEAD>Toyota Previa: New Design for U.S. Market Is Sleek and Innovative</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto, LaserGraphic</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Amid a growing array of minivans on the market, the 1991 Toyota
Previa stands out.
   The Previa features a compact, innovative engine and sleek new
styling. And for minivan owners tired of hauling out the rear seats
to create extra cargo space, a fold-away design keeps them in the
vehicle while providing the extra room.
   The new look, which includes a curved, futuristic control center
in the middle of the dashboard, is the product of Toyota's advanced
design studio in California.
   The major changes include a four-cylinder, 2.4-liter engine that
sits on its side beneath the passenger compartment floor. Pop the
hood on a Previa and you won't find an engine, just the battery,
radiator, oil reservoir and a few other essentials to simplify
regular maintenance. The driver's seat flips back with the touch of
a lever to reveal an access cover for the engine.
   The Previa replaces Toyota's previous passenger van, which had
the cab over the wheels for tight turning in Japan's crowded
streets. The new model has a more American design where the front
passengers sit behind, not over, the front wheels.
   EPA fuel economy is ranued its older van at the end of the 1989 model
year and has been selling the remaining '89 units this year. The
Previa, officially a mid-year introduction, has been available
since March. Toyota reported sales of 12,000 units as of May and
expects to sell 50,000 by the fall of 1991.
   The Previa starts at $13,998, with a five-speed manual
transmission. The LE-model comes standard with automatic
transmission, dual air conditioners, deluxe AM-FM radio with six
speakers, tilt steering wheel and rear window defogger standard.
Price of the test model with those features: $20,995.
   Competitors include the Mazda MPV, which starts around $14,000,
Ford Aerostar at about $13,000, and Chrysler Voyager, at around
$12,500.
   Because the Previa is a new vehicle, Consumer Reports magazine
does not list owner complaints.

   Some cities have decided to make downtown look
like downtown again.
   They are doing away with their pedestrian malls, bulldozing the
kiosks, trees and benches that replaced streets 20 or 30 years ago.
They are welcoming back the fumes and noises of once-banished
traffic.
   And some that haven't decided to return to the downtown of an
earlier time are thinking about it.
   It turns out, said Lawrence O. Houstoun Jr., that converting
traditional shopping districts into a pedestrian malls worked _ but
only for a while. Houstoun is an urban development consultant in
Cranbury, N.J.
   Dry rot has set in again in many central cities, he said,
because office buildings _ which provide many of the shoppers _
have been erected on cheap land too far away for a lunch-time
shopping stroll.
   ``The pedestrian malls had some initial success because they
were the first thing that looked good downtown, but they didn't
deal with the basic problem,'' Houstoun said.
   ``The problem wasn't that people wanted to walk in the streets;
the problem was that downtown wasn't convenient or became
inconvenient.''
   Houstoun said studies have established that at lunch time,
people will walk for nine minutes _ or about three blocks _ from
their office. If stores are a block or two further away, they will
be shunned, no matter how pleasant the environment.
   So, a number of the 200 or so cities that took the plunge in the
late 1960s and the 1970s have undone or down-scaled their malls or
are considering it, Houstoun said. He reported his findings in
Planning, the magazine of the American Planning Association, and
elaborated in an interview.
   Kalamazoo, Mich., which called itself ``Mall City,'' is
reopening two blocks of its four-block mall to traffic. Eugene,
Ore. removed the kiosks, playgrounds, restrooms and plantings from
two blocks of its pedestrian mall.
   New London, Conn. brought back the cars. Three Illinois cities _
Danville, Champaign and Rockford _ have given up their malls.
   Norfolk, Va. and St. Joseph, Mo. kept theirs, but in smaller
configurations. In the capital of New Jersey, cars will return to
part of Trenton Commons. Springfield, Mo. welcomed cars back to
much of its mall, too. ``We drive around the square again,'' says
Bob Turner, acting director of public works.
   But some cities find their mall still work well. The mall in
Boulder, Colo., is a standout. And traffic-choked New York City is
considering going the mall route by ``pedestrianizing'' 10 blocks
of Broadway.
   A number of cities that would like to take out their pedestrian
malls can't afford to, said Houstoun, a former official in the
Departments of Commerce and Housing and Urban Development in
Washington.
   Often the malls were built with federal grants; no federal money
is available to undo them. Houstoun said it can cost $500,000 to
$750,000 a block to take out the ``pedestrian features'' that give
urban malls their character.
   The old, urbane, upper-middle-class Chicago suburb of Oak Park,
Ill., spent $3.1 million in 1988 to take out a mall that had been
built 16 years earlier for $1.4 million.
   In the process, 84 quarter-of-a-century-old pin oak trees were
removed. Those that could be saved were replanted elsewhere in the
community of 55,000.
   But ``it absolutely was not a mistake,'' to build Oak Park Mall
in the first place, said Christine Burdick, executive director of
Downtown Oak Park.
   ``It helped stabilize what in 1972 had been a declining retail
center and helped us maintain a viable retail business,'' she said.
``It worked, it just became obsolete.''
   Adds village manager Neil Nielson: ``It served a life, like
anything else.''
   Most Oak Park residents liked their mall, no matter what
merchants felt. At the very time that streets, curbs, sewers and
lighting were being reinstalled, citizens voted 13,000 to 9,273 in
a non-binding initiative against tearing out the mall.
   What happened was five department stores that had been mall
``anchors'' either went bankrupt or moved away, and business fell
off, Mrs. Burdick said.
   ``Restreeting'' _ her term for it _ has helped business, Mrs.
Burdick said. Sales for the last quarter of 1989 were up 24 percent
over the previous year; 15 new retailers moved in. The occupancy
rate inched up from 75 to 80 percent.
   In its dependence on anchors, Oak Park Mall more closely
resembled on-the-highway regional shopping malls than do most
downtown malls.
   Downtown malls, said Houstoun, typically rely on two different
types of shoppers _ lower-income city residents and office workers
_ whose wants are not alike, adding to the malls' difficulty in
finding a market.
   Office workers are important shoppers. One study found that they
spend an average of $1,800 a year downtown on food and goods, most
of it during the lunch break.
   In retrospect, said Houstoun, cities might have been wiser to
clear abandoned buildings from core areas, making sites available
for office buildings that would have provided the customers for
downtown stores.
   The pedestrian mall, he said, ``wasn't a remedy geared to the
problem and removing them is not a cure for today's problems,
either.''

<HEAD>Government Faces Difficult Task in Cleaning Up Corruption</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister V.P. Singh's
administration rode the white horse of clean government into office
and has launched an anti-corruption campaign, but many question
whether it will succeed.
   Agreement seems general among Western and Indian diplomats and
businessmen that Singh's plan to shake up state-run trading firms
and reform industrial policy will do little to stem India's rising
tide of malfeasance.
   Some feel the expected failure will have little effect on this
huge country of 880 million people and that India will lumber into
the future as it has through the past.
   Many more believe, however, that continued corruption at current
levels will break India's economy and threaten the stability of the
world's most populous democracy.
   ``Corruption poses a major problem for us,'' said Shankar
Acharya, a ranking Finance Ministry official who made a
ground-breaking study of India's ``black'' economy. ``It seems to
be growing daily.''
   The problem permeates Indian society.
   Traffic cops expect ``baksheesh,'' small bribes, to ignore
violations. Businessmen consider payoffs and kickbacks part of the
job.
   ``Every business deal has a beneficiary,'' said a high official
of the State Trading Corp., India's biggest state-run trading
house. ``If I make a little profit on a deal that benefits India,
what's wrong with that?'' He would not let his name be used.
   Factors that encourage corruption multiplied as India's
political system and economy developed.
   For about 20 years after independence from Britain in 1947,
India was virtually a one-party state, run by the Congress Party.
The growth of a viable opposition in the 1960s made elections more
expensive, so political bosses turned to kickbacks for money.
   An expanding economy, which grew an average of more than 5
percent a year in the 1980s, created more wealth and, with it, more
temptation.
   Last year, when Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and his Congress
Party were voted out of power, corruption played a major role for
the first time in the downfall of a government.
   Also for the first time, dirty deals have been blamed for huge
losses in some industries.
   India's fertilizer industry lost $32 million in 1989 after
posting a $50 million profit the previous year.
   The reason, diplomats and Indian officials say privately, was
that Agriculture Ministry officials wanted a $25 million kickback
on a 500,000-ton purchase of phosphoric acid from Morocco's
government phosphates company.
   Morocco refused, India canceled the contract and the fertilizer
industry was without essential phosphoric acid, the informants said.
   Corruption also contributes greatly to a balance of payments
deficit that has built foreign debt of about $60 billion over the
last 10 years, diplomats and Western economists say.
   A report by a Western embassy in January, seen by The Associated
Press, estimated one-third of India's gross national product
disappears into the ``black'' economy.
   ``The sheer number of beneficiaries is seemingly endless and the
habit and pressure so ingrained that it would require a major
change in society as a whole'' to end corruption, the report said.
   Singh's administration announced two major changes in May and
June.
   First, all state-run trading firms were put under a new umbrella
organization, Bharat Business International, which has the power to
monitor international contracts, a major source of illegal wealth.
   Then, the government announced an industrial policy designed to
break the bureaucratic stranglehold on business licenses _ the
``license raj,'' another major channel for bribes.
   Diplomats and officials of the new government say international
contracts are believed to been a major source of revenue for the
Congress Party when it and Gandhi were in power.
   They say purchases were made abroad forinflated prices and the
sellers kicked back most of the extra money to Indian politicians,
who deposited it in party bank accounts.
   Preliminary charges have been filed by the Central Bureau of
Investigation, India's version of the FBI, in two cases involving
members of the Gandhi government.
   It alleges bribes were paid to officials in a $1.47 billion
aircraft purchase from Europe's Airbus Industrie consortium and a
$1.4 billion arms deal with AB Bofors, the Swedish arms
manufacturer.
   The Western and Indian informants describe the reform efforts as
too little, too late.
   In its reform of international purchases, the Singh government
is emphasizing barter. That means part of India's payment for
purchases _ usually 10 to 15 percent _ will be in goods, not
dollars.
   Industrial experts say the practice will allow politicians and
bureaucrats to continue skimming money off the top because there is
no way to fix the value of the bartered goods.
   Reform of the ``license raj'' is widely expected to fail because
the new industrial plan loosens regulations only on the business
license. Bureaucrats and politicians could continue squeezing money
from businessmen for export, import and other permits.
   The structure of the Indian political system works against
reform. Indian law limits campaign spending by a candidates for
Parliament to about $6,000, but most spend $175,000, according to
Indian officials and diplomats.
   Many believe the extra money comes from official corruption.
   ``India's political parties get no contributions,'' a Western
diplomat said. ``They don't raise funds. The only way they get
money is by skimming off the top of deals.''
   Corruption may be continuing under the Singh administration.
   A Western intelligence report seen by the AP says politicians
received kickbacks from Tunisia on the purchase of 130,000 tons of
phosphoric acid in March. The Minerals and Metals Trading Corp. and
the Janata Dal, the main party in the governing coalition, denied
the allegations, which could not be confirmed independently.
   ``We make our (purchasing) decisions on merit only,'' said S.K.
Agrawal, chairman of the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp., which
bought the phosphoric acid.
   Agrawal, an architect of the foreign-purchase reform plan, says
he spends much of his time trying to direct corrupt politicians
away from Minerals and Metals, which he took over in March.
   ``There's a set price in commodities and everyone knows it
worldwide,'' he said in an interview. ``I tell them they should
look at industrial projects, where the value is less clear and
corruption is easier.''

<HEAD>Corruption Has Become Major Issue in Pakistan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED AFTAB</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Politics and corruption go together
in much of the Third World. In Pakistan, they are like hand and
glove.
   Corruption has been brought into the open by a newly free press
and a shift toward democracy after more than a decade of military
rule.
   Accusations of questionable deals and financial wrongdoing turn
up almost daily in newspapers, at news conferences and in speeches.
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto is not immune.
   ``The opposition has launched a witch hunt against members of my
government and members of my family, and their behavior is nothing
short of criminal,'' she said in a recent interview. ``There is a
well-laid conspiracy to hurl one false charge after another, to
manipulate the media.
   ``They are making baseless charges to discredit democracy. We
have three courts in our country and people may go to these courts
if they have anything.''
   Few Pakistanis take such accusers to the courts, which act
slowly and inflict little, if any, punishment.
   Ms. Bhutto's husband, Asif Ali Zardari, is one of the
opposition's main targets.
   ``I am the soft belly,'' he said. ``You hit me and you hit her.''
   Zardari and Ms. Bhutto were married in 1987 while she still led
the opposition to Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, the late military
president.
   ``If an individual in her government is accused of being
corrupt, the prime minister can get rid of him,'' he said. ``If
they say, the husband of the prime minister is corrupt, it echoes
throughout the world. The larger the person, the louder the noise.''
   Ms. Bhutto's two main rivals in Parliament have filed a lawsuit
accusing Zardari of trying to take over 287 acres of Islamabad's
National Park to build a five-star hotel and sports complex in the
name of a company based in London.
   One of them, Syedda Abida Hussain, said, ``The only person
listed as its director in London is Ms. Bhutto's cousin.'
   The government accuses its political opponents of obtaining
millions of dollars worth of bank loans during the 11 years Zia was
in office, then writing them off or repaying them on unusually
favorable terms.
   Twenty opposition figures, including leaders Nawaz Sharif and
Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi, are under government investigation for
alleged wrongdoing.
   Sharif, chief minister of Punjab province, is accused of
obtaining $90 million in loans on special terms, with little
collateral. He denies it.
   ``I offer myself to be investigated by a panel of Supreme Court
judges, but along with me, Ms. Bhutto and all politicians under
suspicion should also be investigated for corruption,'' said Jatoi,
leader of Combined Opposition Parties in the National Assembly.
   An alliance of 16 parties called the Combined Opposition
recently issued an inch-thick collection of documents intended to
implicate Ms. Bhutto's 18-month-old government and her family in
shady deals.
   Allegations range from taking over valuable land and awarding
vast mineral concessions in Sindh province, her power base, to
building factories with dubious loans and obtaining financial
interests in hotels and trade.
   Immediately after copies of the dossier were given to Western
diplomats and foreign journalists, Ms. Bhutto sent four Cabinet
ministers to rebut the charges.
   ``The opposition ... didn't even spare Bakhtawar, the baby
daughter of the prime minister,'' said Khawaja Tariq Rahim,
minister of parliamentary affairs and Ms. Bhutto's political
trouble-shooter.
   The opposition alleged that a well-known family of smugglers in
Karachi gave the baby a valuable piece of property kas a gift.
   ``A 4-month-old baby is being dragged by the opposition into
vicious propaganda,'' Rahim protested.
   The opposition accuses senior ministers of selling rice abroad
for personal profit, financing a textile mill with a politically
influenced loan and borrowing $45 million without collateral to
build a cement factory.
   Faisal Saleh Hayat, commerce minister and a close Bhutto aide,
responded: ``Aren't we the citizens of Pakistan? Why shoudn't we
invest?''
   When the government put forth its budget in June, opposition
members walked out of Parliament because Ehsanul Haq Piracha, the
deputy finance minister, was allowed to present it.
   Piracha was accused of granting the license for the new stock
exchange in Islamabad to his relatives, and a court ruled he
committed ``a clear act of favortism and nepotism.'' He denies
wrongdoing and has taken the case to the Supreme Court.
   There are reports of civilian bureaucrats making money on the
purchase of sugar, jetliners and computers; the sale of old
aircraft, and contracts for construction and communications
projects.
   ``You name it, we have it,'' said a ranking official
investigating corruption. ``If the government is sincere in
prosecuting the corrupt, we can bring up so many cases it will tire
the courts.''
   Pakistan's auditor general, Mojahhad Uzair, said in his annual
report that irregularities, bungling and fraud were rampant in the
government's accounts.
   ``The black money feeding Pakistan's parallel economy was 82
billion rupees ($4 billion) in 1988,'' said Uzair, a
Harvard-educated economist. ``It is spiraling fast, as a result of
growing corruption.''

<HEAD>Abortion Debate Heightens in Year Since Court's Webster Ruling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There's little common ground in the
emotion-packed battle over abortion, but both sides agree that a
deeply torn Supreme Court is moving in the direction of abortion
opponents.
   That conclusion was reinforced last week when the court released
decisions allowing states to make it more difficult for minor women
to get abortions without first notifying their parents.
   It was only the latest sign that another Supreme Court decision
a year earlier _ in a case now known simply as ``Webster'' _ had
firmly placed abortion at the center of the nation's political
debate.
   For both sides as well as the conflicted, ambivalent middle,
Webster was an alarm that still echoes _ in politics, in state
legislatures, and in the court itself.
   ``The Webster decision was a wake-up call,'' said Rep. Patricia
Schroeder, D-Colo. She is sponsoring a bill that would write into
federal law the legal right to abortion that the court granted 17
years ago in Roe vs. Wade.
   The Webster decision was issued one year ago this week. It
allowed Missouri to restrict the use of public money, medical
personnel and facilities in performing abortions. It also upheld
the state's law requiring doctors to determine through tests
whether a fetus at least 20 weeks old is viable, or capable of
living outside the womb. The state makes it a crime to abort a
viable fetus.
   The effect of this 5-to-4 decision was to let states make
abortions harder to obtain.
   In the ensuing year, political candidates have seized the issue
or dived for cover from its exploding force. State legislatures
have moved, often cautiously, to exercise or test their new
authority to restrain abortions.
   Polls have searched for shifting sentiment and found
ambivalence. And everyone awaits the court's next words on the
issue.
   ``At best, we are now one court appointment away from losing Roe
vs. Wade. At worst, we are just one case away,'' said Kate
Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion Rights
Action League.
   ``The right to choose is going to be overturned as a
constitutionally protected right, and we're going back to a time
where we have to fight this out at every state legislative level
and end up with a patchwork of laws,'' she said. ``Voters are using
the political process to protect the rights the courts will no
longer guarantee.''
   Some abortion opponents agree with Michelman's assessment, but
they're not sure the court is ready to take back the legal right to
an abortion.
   ``As time goes on we're beginning to see that Webster signaled
an opportunity to whittle away at Roe, but I believe we're probably
one vote short of an outright reversal of Roe,'' said Gary Bauer, a
former Reagan administration official who heads the anti-abortion
Family Research Council.
   The court's lone female justice, Sandra Day O'Connor, is
regarded as the pivotal vote. She swung both ways in the Minnesota
decision last week, ruling against the state's law requiring that
girls notify both parents before obtaining an abortion, but
upholding parental notification as long as girls can avoid telling
their parents by getting a judge's permission instead.
   ``Every time the court gets one of these cases, Roe vs. Wade is
going to be at risk,'' said James Bopp Jr., general counsel for the
National Right to Life Committee.
   The result has been to thrust the issue squarely back before the
states.
   Virtually every state legislature has considered some kind of
abortion-limiting bill in the year since Webster, but only a few
have been enacted.
   ``It's been slower than the right-to-life movement hoped for,''
said Bauer. ``On the other hand, we have nowhere to go but up. This
time last year we had abortion on demand in all 50 states. Twelve
months later, a number of states are moving toward more and more
restrictions.''
   Two states considered abortion restrictions last fall. Florida
Gov. Bob Martinez called the state's legislature into special
session to restrict abortion and saw his bill fail.
   In Pennsylvania, where Democratic Gov. Robert Casey is strongly
opposed to abortion, legislation was enacted that prohibits
abortions at hospitals receiving public money and imposes other
restrictions. Most of the provisions have been blocked pending
court challenges.
   Bills that would ban virtually all abortions were considered in
at least 10 states. Idaho's version was vetoed by Democratic Gov.
Cecil Andrus under great national pressure.
   Louisiana's legislature just passed a sweeping ban, but Gov.
Buddy Roemer has promised to veto it. The U.S. territory of Guam
enacted a broad ban on abortion that has been blocked for now by
court challenges.
   Other states considered an array of proposals backed by
right-to-life forces to restrict abortion. Michigan Gov. James
Blanchard vetoed a bill requiring teen-agers to gain their parents'
permission before receiving an abortion. South Carolina Gov.
Carroll Campbell signed a similar measure.
   Both sides watch each state carefully, because each could become
the test case that will make its way to the Supreme Court and
trigger a ruling on whether to overturn Roe vs. Wade.
   This year's elections also are being closely watched. Several
contests around the country are shaping up as test cases for the
new politics of abortion.
   The Webster decision energized both sides in the fight on
abortion and emboldened supporters of abortion rights who had not
been as well organized as the pro-life movement.
   NARAL, the political arm of the pro-choice movement, saw its
membership surge from 133,000 to more than 750,000 in the months
after Webster.
   Schroeder said Webster removed what had been political
insulation from the issue.
   ``People thought they could play with the politics as the court
was standing there as the marble defender of human rights,'' she
said. ``When the marble came down, they couldn't.''
   Douglas Wilder in 1989 built a ground-breaking campaign around
support for abortion rights and was elected governor of Virginia by
framing the issue as a question of an individual's freedom to
choose.
   In another key off-year race, Republican Rep. James Courter lost
his bid to become governor of New Jersey after retreating from his
opposition to abortion.
   Right-to-life groups blamed the two defeated candidates for
their losses, saying they failed to demonstrate strong opposition
to abortion.
   Since then, many candidates have reversed or shifted positions
to support abortion rights. The most dramatic example was Ohio's
Democratic candidate for governor, state Attorney General Anthony
Celebrezze Jr.
   Both sides view this year's gubernatorial races as critical,
since governors have the power to veto restrictive legislation.
Careful attention also is being paid to Iowa's Senate race, where
abortion-rights advocate Sen. Thomas Harkin is being challenged by
Republican Rep. Tom Tauke, an abortion foe.
   Supporters of legalized abortion have adopted Wilder's strategy
of framing the issue as a matter of who decides a woman's
reproductive rights. Opponents, meanwhile, frame the question as
one of protecting the unborn.
   The Republican Party, which for a decade has made opposition to
abortion a part of its platform, now wrestles with whether to
abandon that position.
   Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater has said the party is a
``big tent'' able to accommodate all views on abortion. But the
party seems headed for a struggle over the issue at its next
convention.
   President Bush has remained opposed to abortion and has vetoed
bills passed by Congress that would allow federal spending on
abortions for poor women.
   But he has kept his distance from the issue. Like President
Reagan before him, Bush has addressed anti-abortion rallies by
telephone rather than in person, although they were just a few
blocks from the White House.
   ``While everyone is extremely happy about the vetoes, we wish
there was more leadership on the issue,'' Bauer said of Bush.
   For all the attention and energy spent on abortion over the past
year, polls suggest public thinking hasn't changed as much as
conventional political wisdom.
   Everett C. Ladd, director of the Roper Center for Public Opinion
Research at the University of Connecticut, said polling reflects
public ambivalence. Majorities like the idea of individual choice,
but don't like the notion of 1.8 million abortions every year in
the United States, he said.
   ``People are pulled in two different ways,'' Ladd said. ``Go
somewhere else to reconcile it. The public doesn't.''

<HEAD>Thoughts for the 90s From 39 Conservative Thinkers</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The old battle cries stir no souls. Being
anti-communist is anticlimactic and being anti-deficit is out of
fashion and not much fun.
   So what's a good old conservative to stand for, now that the
rock-solid convictions have lost their sizzle?
   It's a question conservatives have been asking each other, and a
question Policy Review, magazine of the conservative Heritage
Foundation, asked 39 ``conservative leaders.''
   More specifically, the 39 were asked to provide lists of the 10
most important priorities for the conservative movement in the
1990s, now that the old priorities lack clout.
   The question produced not much consensus, but some surprises
just the same.
   Some participants chose to rally yet around the Strategic
Defense Initiative, even though nuclear exchanges between the
superpowers aren't much envisioned any longer.
   They also found some common ground on the concept of giving
people freedom to chose the school their kids can attend and on
limiting how long politicians can stay in Congress: two emerging
conservative touchstones.
   SDI? Yes, press on with Star Wars, some of these thinkers said.
   ``The implosion of the Evil Empire does make the world less
dangerous for America, but not yet risk-free,'' argued Pete duPont,
former governor of Delaware and former candidate for the job George
Bush holds. ``Tomorrow, a dozen nations may have ICBMs.''
   ``Deploy SDI,'' counselled Grover Norquist, president of
Americans for Tax Reform. ``Libya, Iraq, Iran and a future Soviet
empire split in 20 parts all argue for a defense against nuclear or
chemical weapon-tipped missiles.''
   ``The reduction of troops in Western Europe will provide ample
funding to build a total defense against any accidental, deliberate
or terrorist assault with nuclear missiles,'' said Phyllis
Schlafly, a conservative crusader from Alton, Ill., another SDI
champion.
   As for schools, privatize 'em, advised Jeffrey A. Eisenach,
president of the Washington Policy Group.
   ``Would educational vouchers spell the end of the public
schools?'' he asked. ``Only if public schools fail the market
test.''
   Norquist also made a case for ending the system under which
public schools have a monopoly on educating all kids in the
neighborhood, even if a school elsewhere does a better job.
   ``We cannot enter the 21st century with an educational system
based on the model of Soviet agriculture,'' he said.
   ``Limit congressional terms,'' pleaded Pat Robertson, another
fallen competitor for the GOP presidential nomination in 1988.
``America's Founding Fathers never envisioned the House of
Representatives as a retirement home.''
   ``Liberate Congress,'' chimed in Ken Tomlinson, former director
of the Voice of America. ``There is hope for congressmen who say
they cannot maintain two residences on their income: limit
congressional terms.''
   There were plenty of votes for continuing the Reagan revolution
by cutting taxes, but not many of these conservatives spent much
energy cursing the deficit, once a conservative whipping boy.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., was for combatting both deficit and
taxes by going after government spending. ``The tax burden on the
American people is outrageous,'' he said.
   And Edwin J. Feulner Jr., president of Heritage, rued this:
``The federal government is bigger today than when Ronald Reagan
took office in 1981.''
   ``Cut federal taxes for the sake of children,'' urged Allan
Carlson, president of the Rockford Institute. He proposed a $1,000
tax credit per child.
   All good old conservative ideas. But did these conservatives
have any fresh ideas for the 90s?
   They did.
   George Weigel, president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center,
argued for massive reconstruction now that the days of massive
retaliation are gone.
   ``Am I the only one who thinks it a disgrace that the interstate
highway system in beginning to look (and feel!) like something in
the Third World?'' he asked.
   Norquist had a new idea: ``Greatly increase immigration to
America,'' he proposed.
   ``In nations with free-market economies, people are a resource,
not a burden,'' he said. ``Immigrants bring life, skills, youth and
a love of freedom to Freedom's home: America.''
   ``Free Hong Kong,'' proposed Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., mindful
that Britain's island colony is to come under Chinese control in
1997.
   ``If we allow that remarkable little territory to become captive
to the totalitarians on the mainland without absolute guarantees of
democracy and freedom for Hong Kong citizens, then we will have
failed the cause of freedom ...''
   And Lee Edwards, lecturer in politics at Catholic University of
America, said conservatives should not let their generations-long
fight with communism slip out of memory.
   ``Erect a `Victims of Communism Memorial' on the Mall,'' he
urged. ``Whether communism is headed for the ash heap of history or
not, conservatives must never let the world forget the human cost
of communism _ the tens of millions of innocents who died as a
result of communist tyranny.''

   The Indonesians may have a lesson to teach
other countries rich in buried ancient art.
   In those places, looters often sell artifacts to private dealers
rather than turn them over to authorities. The Indonesian
authorities compete with the private collectors, however, rewarding
finders generously.
   Now, at a show opening today at the National Gallery of Art, are
many treasures that came to the Indonesian government through its
reward system.
   One of the treasures was found in a cave on the island of Java
by a group of archaeologists helping the government survey tourist
sites.
   ``Five hundred meters inside the cave filled with stalagmites
and stalactites, on top of a tall rock shaped like an altar, they
discovered a large bronze vessel containing several objects,
including this gold and silver statuette of a couple holding
hands,'' wrote Jan Fontein of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, who
put the show together.
   Archaeologists calculate that the tiny couple _ less than 5
inches high _ must be at least 1,000 years old, probably a bit
more. They still aren't sure who the subjects were, probably the
Hindu god Shiva and his consort Parvati.
   Both wear costumes that leave the upper part of their bodies
bare. Their heads are surrounded by haloes and protected by little
golden parasols.
   The show, ``The Sculpture of Indonesia,'' will be in Washington
through Nov. 4 before traveling to Houston, New York and San
Francisco. Many of its best items were found by chance.
   A much bigger Shiva _ more than 42 inches high _ in gold, bronze
and silver, with four arms and three eyes, was found in 1933 by
farmers bathing in the Kali Wadas River.
   Fontein has added up 854 separate finds, some of which include
several objects. They were officially reported to Dutch colonial
authorities before Indonesia became independent, and since then to
the Indonesian government and other official bodies.
   ``There's a tendency to report them because of the fair way the
authorities reward the finders,'' he told a news conference.
   In many parts of the world finders get more by selling their
treasures secretly than they would if they reported them to a
museum. That enrages museums and archaeologists because thieves and
amateurs often destroy much of the evidence, sometimes unwittingly.
   Fontein told of a boy working in an Indonesian garden last year
who found a golden neckpiece that weighed over 3{ pounds. He said
the authorities paid the full market price of the gold and divided
it between the boy and owner of the garden.
   ``The boy's education is assured,'' he added.
   Fontein was allowed to see the neckpiece on condition he did not
ask for it to be sent to the exhibition. An attempt will be made to
film it for a production linked with an 18-month celebration of
Indonesian culture to open here in September.
   J. Carter Brown, director of the National Gallery, said this
exhibit opened before September because so many people visit
Washington in the summertime.
   Fontein said he did not know why so many objects were buried,
many of them close to the surface. One farmer found a temple bell
because a new kind of sugar cane required him to plow a few
centimeters deeper. Near it was box with a chain from which the
bell had been hung.
   ``Sometimes I think they buried them just for us to find,'' he
said.
   Many were buried by faithful Buddhists and Hindus when Indonesia
was invaded by Moslems 400 years ago. The Moslems disapproved of
representations of people and living things and objects connected
with other religions.
   Buddhists and Hindus took refuge in the hills of Java. The final
object in the show is a three-panel sculpture, apparently of Hindu
origin. It is more than 5 feet high and 7 feet long and shows a
scene in a blacksmith's shop. On one side is the smith forging a
sword, on the other a man working a bellows to heat the forge.
   In the middle is a fat man with the head of an elephant, naked
and dancing. He is wearing a priest's headdress and holding a small
dog in one hand.
   What is he doing there? That story is lost.

   At lunch over Memorial Day weekend in 1987,
Mary Roy ate an orange that burned her mouth and throat and
triggered her three-year effort to get stores to label treated
produce.
   Doctors said it was bronchitis.
   ``I knew it was that orange,'' said Roy, 58, an Amherst
composer-cum-environmental activist. ``It's like, when you trip on
a banana peel, that's what tripped you.''
   Her supermarket told her the orange had been sprayed with a
pesticide.
   Roy later learned that oranges and many other fruits and
vegetables frequently are sprayed with post-harvest pesticides. The
pesticides, typically mixed with wax, make produce look better and
last longer.
   Four of the 18 most common pesticides _ folpet, benomyl, captan
and thiophanate-methyl _ are considered possible or probable human
carcinogens by the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA allows
them to be used because it considers their benefits in preventing
rotting or infestation to outweigh the risk of cancer, agency
spokesman Al Heier said.
   This spring, Roy's one-woman lobby got New Hampshire to put
teeth in its long-unenforced law requiring stores to label fruit
and vegetables that have been waxed. Fines are $200 for a first
violation and $500 for subsequent ones.
   ``You really have to push them to do this,'' said Roy, who now
eats organically grown produce. ``The trouble is that it's so
difficult to fight the powers that be _ it is not popular with
industry.''
   A federal law has required that waxed fruit be labeled for
decades, but it hasn't been enforced, and supermarkets rarely abide
by it.
   Last year, Maine became the first state to require post-harvest
pesticide labeling. Regulations still are being drawn up to enforce
the law.
   This spring, New York Attorney General Robert Abrams proposed a
law that would go beyond Maine's. It would require the names of
pesticides used after harvest to be posted next to produce. In
Maine, stores need only a sign indicating pesticide use, but are
required to provide shoppers who ask with details within 48 hours.
   ``A number of post-harvest pesticides may have adverse health or
environmental effects,'' Abrams said. ``The use of these pesticides
presents a legitimate concern to consumers, who are increasingly
demanding to know the contents of the food they purchase.''
   There is a safe food movement in California, but no legislative
action has resulted. And Consumers for Safe Food in Illinois is
pushing for wax labeling. Pesticides usually are mixed with waxes
used to replace natural wax lost in processing. They are added to
prevent mold, rot and other deterioration while the produce is
packed, shipped and sold.
   According to Americans for Safe Food, fruits and vegetables that
can be waxed are apples, cucumbers, bananas, beets, cantaloupe,
coconuts, garlic, grapefruit, oranges, lemons, limes, mangoes,
pumpkins, eggplants, papayas, potatoes, rutabagas, squash,
tomatoes, turnips, watermelons, nuts, tangerines, plantains,
peppers, avocados and pineapples.
   Some waxes contain derivatives of animal fat, a concern to
people who follow Jewish or Moslem dietary laws.
   In addition to labels on waxed produce, federal law requires
wholesalers to identify on shipping crates the post-harvest
pesticides used, but does not require that information to be passed
on to consumers.
   Waxes aren't dangerous in themselves, but seal in pesticides,
which can penetrate the peel into the fruit, said Susan Cooper of
the National Coalition Against Misuse of Pesticides.
   The Food and Drug Administration does not enforce the labeling
law.
   ``We have only so many resources, and labeling is not a
priority,'' said Curtis Coker, assistant to the director in the
division of regulatory guidance. ``I'm glad to see that the states
have more recently taken an interest in that.''
   But he said a proliferation of state requirements could cause
confusion.
   Those resisting labeling range from pesticide manufacturers who
consider their ingredients trade secrets to produce growers and
marketers who fear their produce will be stigmatized, Coker said.
   ``We see it as unnecessary,'' said Jill Snowden, director of
scientific affairs for the United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable
Association, which represents about 80 percent of the nation's
produce growers and distributors.
   ``There's a certain amount of liability for the producer''
because the labels could give the products a poor image, she said.
``What we're seeing now is regulation based on fear.''
   Phyllis Spaeth of the New York attorney general's office
disagrees.
   ``We're not trying to scare people,'' Spaeth said. ``The most
important thing is that consumers should have a right to know
what's in there.''
   New York's push for labeling laws came after a survey of
supermarket chains failed to find any properly labeled shipping
cartons.
   But Snowden said detailed pesticide labeling faces great
hurdles. Produce goes from farmer to packing shed, where it is
treated, to wholesaler to retailer, so ``you have no way of easily
labeling a single item.''
   Retailers say they can only pass on the shipping carton label,
which they have no simple way of checking.
   ``It'll be a problem, naturally, but we're going to do what the
law requires,'' said Angelo Eliopoulos, director of produce at
Market Basket, a 40-store New England supermarket chain.
   David Sneddon, co-owner of Fairway Fruits and Vegetables in New
York City, said putting a sign up won't be a problem, but taking
responsibility for what it says will.
   ``We're not chemists,'' he said. ``As long as somebody tells me
what to write, I'll do it. The problem is, how can you guarantee
what's on the product? Who's responsible?''
   Roy, meanwhile, said she's waiting for New Hampshire officials
to go through the rulemaking process before signs appear in
supermarkets. She doesn't know when that will be.
   But her crusade won't lead her back to mainstream grocery
shopping. ``I already know all I need to know,'' she said.

<HEAD>Survey Finds Consumers Favor Nutritional Labels in Supermarkets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOODMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A majority of consumers surveyed said they
favor labels on supermarket shelves detailing the nutritional value
of products and would use the information to plan meals, a
nutritionist said.
   ``Nutrition shelf labeling reaches consumers in a clear and
direct way by providing information at the point of purchase,''
said Claire Boasi, a nutrition professor in the College on Nursing
at the University of Pennsylvania.
   The labels used in the survey distingushed six categories: low
calorie, low sodium, low fat, low cholesterol, source of fiber and
source of calcium.
   Ms. Boasi spoke recently at the fourth annual Conference of the
Association for the Study of Food and Society at Drexel University.
The convention included nutritionists and sociologists from the
United States, Europe, Mexico and India.
   ``Store labeling is uniform, consistent, standardized, visible
and accessible. It is literally on the shelf,'' she said.
   Fifty-four percent of the 283 respondents said such labeling
should be extended, Ms. Boasi said. And 67 percent said they used
the nutrition information to plan meals. The study was carried out
by leaving questionnaires in supermarkets. Seventy-eight percent of
the respondents were men.
   Ms. Boasi is a consultant to Data Documents Systems, a Kansas
firm specializing in food labeling. The company asked the federal
Food and Drug Administration for permission to conduct the survey
in 16 supermarkets in 12 states.
   Bill Whit, co-organizer of the conference and a former president
of the Association for the Study of Food and Society, was skeptical
of how stores would react. ``Most advertising is centered around
products based on non-nutritional characteristics,'' he said.
   Ms. Boasi said stores would use labeling in response to consumer
demand.
   Michael Jacobsen, executive director of the Center for Science
in the Public Interest, a non-profit consumer advocacy group in
Washington, D.C., said shelf labeling is a good way to get
nutrition information to consumers.
   But such labels would be easy to miss, Jacobsen said. He noted
there are proposals in Congress that would require labels on most
food packages.

   In the World Series of Birding, people do
the migrating.
   Hoping to identify as many birds as possible in 24 hours,
five-person teams came to New Jersey for a weekend in May to cough
like a clapper rail and squint through binoculars.
   A team sponsored by Carl Zeiss Optical in Alexandria, Va.,
captured the seventh annual birdwatching title by identifying 210
birds after racing over 490 miles.
   ``Stop! Please stop! Please stop the van!'' shouted Julie
Zickefoose, a bird illustrator from Hadlyme, Conn. ``There's a tern
hovering.''
   The group identified the bird within 10 seconds and shouted,
``Drive on.''
   ``You don't have time to enjoy the bird,'' said Rick Radis, a
writer from Denville, N.J., who was on the winning team. ``It was:
`There's a stilt sandpiper. Let's get back in the car.'''
   Sponsored by the New Jersey Audubon Society, the contest began
at 12:01 a.m. and ended the following midnight. The teams
frantically criss-crossed hundreds of miles of New Jersey from
pinelands to shore marsh.
   Most started in northwestern New Jersey relying on their ability
to hear birds in the morning darkness. With daylight came a
southward migration of birdwatchers, who hit the New Jersey shore
tired but eager by midday. The competition ended on the tip of New
Jersey's southern shore in Cape May, a haven for migratory birds on
their Atlantic flyway.
   The state attracts a variety of birds because of its varying
terrain of coastline, small mountains and pinelands. Its location
between Canada and the southern United States also makes it
possible to find birds from those areas.
   On a sunny and windy afternoon _ wind hampers birdcalls _ the
``birders'' descended on the Edwin Forsythe National Wildlife
Refuge in Oceanville.
   The vans make their own formation by rumbling slowly along a
dirt road until someone sights or hears a new bird species.
   Teams operate on the honor system and all members are required
to have seen or heard the bird for it to be marked off. Five
percent of the birds do not have to be identified by all members.
This year, 253 birds were identified by the 35 teams. The clapper
rail was heard but not seen.
   Would a birder lie?
   ``It's the last of the honor sports,'' said Peter Alden, a tour
group leader from New York City who has visited more than 100
countries and seen more than 5,000 bird species. ``But you could
have lied through your teeth, gotten up at 11 in the morning and
figured out what you could have seen.''
   Alden and Ms. Zickefoose's group, which also included actress
Jane Alexander, didn't seem like the lying kind. Bird
identification books littered their van and three hours of travel
with them showed their love for mastering the coughs that will draw
out a clapper rail and for whipping out binoculars fast enough to
spot a snowy egret.
   The team ended up counting 168 birds, finishing 18th.
   For the weekend at least, the camaraderie disappeared between
birders who ordinarily would gladly show another that barn owl in
the refuge's pewter-colored waters set against the casino skyline
of Atlantic City.
   ``At the end of the day, everybody kind of laughs at the bird
you didn't get,'' said Alf Wilson, co-owner of a Walpole,
Mass.-based company putting out a bird identification video.
   Then he grew silent and cupped his ears while his teammates
coughed, trying to attract the elusive clapper rail.
   As for the winners, they credited their victory to 500 hours of
advance scouting and simple birders' luck at birdspotting or
``getting on the bird.''
   For example, they found a red crossbill in northern New Jersey
even though the migratory bird is not usually found in the state in
spring or summer.
   And members of the winning team _ who got a team trophy and a
pair of binoculars apiece _ said they celebrated their victory by
getting a jump on next year's scouting. They got up early the next
day and spotted a Mississippi kite.
   ``It's for enjoyment, but it's more of a game,'' Radis said.

<HEAD>Diabetes Patients May Soon Get Implanted Pumps</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURAN NEERGAARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The implanted insulin pump may soon offer more
independence for diabetics, doctors at the American Diabetes
Association convention said.
   But two specialists said relief through organ transplants or an
implanted glucose sensor that doesn't require patients to monitor
blood sugar levels is a long way away.
   Dr. Christopher Saudek, an associate professor of medicine at
Johns Hopkins University who has worked on implanted insulin pumps
for a decade, told about 300 association members at last month's
convention that studies on the pump have been so successful it may
be on the market by 1993.
   The pump is a disc of titanium about 3 inches thick implanted
under the skin in the abdomen with a catheter that delivers
insulin, which is absorbed directly into the liver. Diabetics
cannot produce or process insulin, a hormone that acts on sugars
and starches in the blood.
   With the pump, insulin is delivered at a basic rate, except
before meals, when the wearer decides how much of a bonus boost to
deliver.
   In 1986, the pump was implanted in 10 people at Johns Hopkins
and eight at the University of California.
   ``The results of these trials showed they could control their
diabetes very well,'' Saudek said. ``They love it.''
   Pumps have been implanted in 13 people since January, and will
be implanted at seven hospitals in the United States and three in
France. If these trials succeed, Saudek said, he will seek Food and
Drug Administration approval to market the pump.
   The pump will be expensive _ $10,000 to $12,000, Saudek
predicted _ and not without maintenance problems. Tissue has a
tendency to block the catheter, resulting in an operation to clear
it in six of the 10 Johns Hopkins patients.
   But the costs more than cover the cost of complications _
blindness, amputations, coronary artery disease _ that result from
inability to control insulin flow, he said.
   Saudek and Dr. David Scharp, a professor at Washington
University School of Medicine in St. Louis, said the 1990s will
bring basic research into such advances as ``closed-loop'' implants
and islet-pancreas transplants.
   In the closed-loop system, glucose sensors would monitor blood
sugar levels and automatically adjust insulin flow from implanted
pumps. Saudek thinks it will take three to five years to develop an
accurate sensor.
   Scharp is conducting studies to determine if transplanting
islets _ pancreas cells that produce insulin _ will allow patients
to achieve insulin independence. So far, two have, he said.
   Scharp believes islets show promise for relieving diabetes
without the longer operation and recuperation time of whole
pancreas transplants.
   But there are many questions about the procedure _ primarily
rejection rates, he said. Anti-rejection drugs like cyclosporin can
suppress natural insulin productivity, defeating the purpose of the
transplant, Scharp said.

   Also at the convention:
   A federal researcher who set out to see what doctors know about
diabetes and what they're doing about it says many diabetics aren't
getting the care they need.
   In a survey of more than 2,000 family physicians, general
practitioners, internists and pediatricians who treat diabetic
patients, 87 percent agreed with the importance of maintaining
blood glucose levels.
   More than two out of three are relying on a ``fairly useless''
diagnostic test, and only about half are prescribing the right
number of insulin injections, said Dr. Lois Lipsett of the National
Institute of Diabetic and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.
   ``The major problem is how to reach these people,'' she said
after presenting her findings. ``People with diabetes could be, and
should be, receiving better medical care.''
   The survey was conducted between June and December last year
among 3,481 general physicians who were not diabetes specialists;
67 percent participated.
   Lipsett said general physicians treat four out of five of the
nation's diabetics.
   Only about one-third ordered regular glycosylated hemoglobin
tests _ a recommended monitoring test for diabetes _ and only about
17 percent performed such tests every three months, as recommended
by the diabetes association. Nearly 70 percent were relying on
urine dipstick tests to monitor their patients, even though that is
no longer regarded as appropriate by the association.
   Single daily insulin injections were the standard for 39 percent
of the doctors treating diabetics ages 18 and 39, and for 51
percent of those treating patients 40 and older. The association's
standards of care call for multiple insulin injections in most
cases.

<HEAD>Computers Help in Diagnosis of Heart Ailments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new computer system that lets doctors
view a chronological sequence of electrocardiograms will help with
the diagnosis of heart ailments, researchers said.
   The system has been tested for three years with several thousand
heart patients, researchers from the University of Florida Health
Science Center and Duke University Medical Center said last month.
   The researchers say the system offers major advantages over the
standard computer analysis of single electrocardiograms, or EKGs,
in detecting changes in heart function.
   An EKG is a tracing of wave forms that reflect the pattern of
electrical impulses depicting contractions of the heart.
   ``Comparing electrocardiograms in patients is literally a must,
and this kind of system has definitely arrived,'' said Dr. Irene
Ferrer, professor of clinical medicine at Columbia University in
New York.
   Tracking the progression of a heart attack is probably the most
important clinical benefit of serial comparison, said University of
Florida cardiologist Lamar Crevasse and computer scientist Mario
Ariet.
   The scientists, who developed the system in conjunction with
Hewlett Packard Co., said the computer attaches a time and date to
each episode of unusual electrical activity in the heart.
   The system ``can analyze in 15 seconds what it would take a
trained physician two hours to perform with measurements comparable
to those of the computer,'' Crevasse said.
   Dr. Joseph Greenfield, Duke University's chairman of medicine
and chief of cardiology, said the comparative analysis still has
shortcomings and needs more precise data programmed into it to
improve the accuracy of its interpretations.

   A specialized, tiny mirror could help
scientists play a major role in a race with the Japanese to move
onto the next plateau in computer technology, researchers say.
   The University of Arizona's Optical Sciences Laboratory makes
precisely ground mirrors the size of a contact lens. Scientists
hope the mirrors will aid the university's attempt to dominate a
$100 billion market for faster, more powerful electronic
semiconductor chips, which are the basic building blocks of modern
computers and electronic devices.
   By developing small mirrors to focus X-rays, rather than visible
or ultraviolet light, scientists hope to be able to etch a thousand
times more circuits onto the surface of semiconductor chips than
now possible.
   Such a breakthrough would usher in another revolution in speed
and miniaturization for computers, consumer electronics and
military technology.
   ``The whole name of the game is to cram more processing power
onto the surface of a fingernail-sized semiconductor chip,'' said
Charles Falco, director of research on X-ray optics. ``The
technique that we've been using for four decades has been taken to
its physical limits.''
   At present, electronics engineers can place about 1 million
circuits onto the surface of a chip. Falco, his team and
researchers at Princeton University and Bell Laboratories _
partners in a joint venture _ hope to put 1 billion circuits on a
chip.
   To achieve the goal, they must narrow stencil lines now only 1
percent as wide as a human hair.

<HEAD>Florida Researchers To Help Treat Chernobyl Victims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   University of Florida researchers will
help treat thousands of victims of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster
in a study that could help prepare the United States for a similar
accident.
   Researchers from the university's Institute of Food and
Agricultural Sciences are helping Ukrainian colleagues to develop a
process for extracting pectin from sugar beets, said Donald Price,
vice president for sponsored research.
   Doctors from the university's Health Science Center will help
determine how much pectin is needed to rid the body of heavy metals
left behind by the accident.
   ``This collaboration will serve as a giant clinical study on the
effectiveness of pectin in treating these illnesses,'' Price said.
   Pectin is a carbohydrate normally extracted from citrus and
apples and used in jams, jellies and candies. University
researchers patented a process last year to extract pectin from
sugar beets, which are plentiful in the Soviet Union, Price said.
   Thousands of Soviet citizens have dangerously high levels of
metals such as uranium in their bodies. The metals were introduced
into the air, water and food chain by the April 1986 explosion at
the Chernobyl plant north of Kiev, said Kenneth Finger, university
vice presient of health affairs.
   Pectin attracts these metals as it travels through the
intestinal tract and removes them from the body, Finger said.
Doctors will work with the Soviets to determine the proper dosage
and if mixing pectin with other chemicals increases its
effectiveness, he added.
   Finger said damage to internal organs and respiratory problems
are examples of damage done by radiation poisoning.

<TEXT>
   Aided by President Bush's concession on taxes,
Japanese and U.S. negotiators appeared close to agreement today on
measures to resolve their structural trade problems.
   Bush and Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu talked on the telephone
late Wednesday about Japan's increased offer to boost public works
spending _ a key area of disagreement. Japanese officials said Bush
expressed appreciation for Kaifu's efforts.
   ``This represents a breakthrough,'' said a Foreign Ministry
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Japanese news reports said this morning's talks had produced
agreements on the remaining two issues: Japan's long process for
approving patents, and how to monitor the anticipated accord
resulting from the trade talks, called the Structural Impediments
Initiative.
   Kyodo News Service quoted S. Linn Williams, the deputy U.S.
trade representative, as saying Japan had agreed to reduce, within
five years, the time needed to process a patent application from
the current 37 months to 24 months.
   Japan Broadcasting Corp. said the two countries also agreed to
meet at least twice a year to monitor compliance with the accord.
   A top U.S. negotiator on Wednesday used Bush's announcement of
his acceptance of the need for tax revenue increases to prod Japan
to boost its offer on public works spending.
   ``It took more political courage to raise (tax) revenues that it
would to increase public spending,'' said the official, who spoke
on condition of anonymity. ``The president made an important
decision. We hope our Japanese friends realize that.''
   Afterward, Kaifu met with Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.
Japanese media reported they decided to pledge an added $96.77
billion to Japan's public works spending over the coming 10 years.
   The new spending total of $2.77 trillion was still short of the
U.S. demand for $3.22 trillion, and U.S. officials refused to
confirm Japanese reports that the matter had been resolved.
   An announcement was expected later in the day after Kaifu's
cabinet meets to discuss the draft accord.
   The linkage between U.S. taxes and Japanese public spending
showed the interdependence of the immense U.S. and Japanese
economies, the world's two largest.
   That interdependence is at the heart of the trade talks, which
seek fundamental economy policy changes to slash Japan's $49
billion trade surplus with the United States.
   Japan has argued that the United States must cut its budget
deficit to reduce the trade gap. The budget deficit helps stimulate
U.S. consumer demand, which in turn increases sales of Japanese
products in the United States.
   U.S. negotiators, on the other hand, have argued that increased
spending on public works in Japan could reduce the trade deficit by
boosting demand for U.S. imports and construction services. Such
spending also could soak up some of the Japanese hoard of savings
and investment funds, another source of friction between the two
countries.
   The structural talks also covered such Japanese issues as high
land prices, laws restricting large retail stores, collusive
practices of large business groups and pricing mechanisms.
   On the U.S. side, the issues included measures to promote
exports, training of workers and competitiveness of U.S. products.
   The structural trade talks were launched last September and an
interim report was agreed in April. The current round started
Monday with the aim of producing a final report on Tuesday, but
disagrements forced a two-day extension.

   News that AT&amp;T's second-quarter profit will be
lower than a year ago _ and below analysts' expectations _ sent the
price of the nation's most widely held stock sliding.
   Wednesday's announcement by American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
was the first time since the 1984 breakup of the former Bell System
that the nation's largest phone company has given advance warning
of a lower profit.
   AT&amp;T shares closed at $39.12{ on the New York Stock Exchange,

   Apparel manufacturer Salant Corp. sought refuge
in bankruptcy court after struggling unsuccessfully with debts
incurred in buying a larger rival two years ago.
   Wednesday's filing under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy
Code was the second for the New York-based clothing company, whose
nationally known brands include Dr. Denton sleepwear, John Henry
shirts and Lady Manhattan sportswear.
   Salant, which bought Manhattan Industries Inc. for $105 in 1988,
attributed its troubles to weakness in the retail business.

   Regulators formed a legal task force to seek
compensation for taxpayers from bankrupt Drexel Burnham Lambert
Group for junk bond losses suffered by failed savings and loans.
   Alfred Byrne, general counsel of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., said Wednesday the agency has preliminary information
linking Drexel and its former junk bond chief, Michael Milken, to
millions of dollars lost by a number of failed thrifts in junk
bonds.
   The FDIC, which insures bank and thrift deposits, and the
Resolution Trust Corp., responsible for handling failed thrifts,
may be Drexel's largest creditors, he said.

   Merger activity fell sharply in the first half
of the year as the takeover business continued to contract because
of the scarcity of financing.
   Securities Data Corp., a financial research firm, reported
Wednesday that 2,110 transactions involving U.S. firms worth a
total of $88.2 billion took place in the first six months to date,
down 50 percent in value from the 2,420 deals worth $193 billion in

   Stock prices pulled out of their recent slump with a rally
Wednesday, shrugging off unwelcome earnings news from American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials,
which had fallen 59.40 points over the past three sessions, climbed
19.80 to 2,862.13.
   The dollar drifted higher, as did gold. Bond prices advanced,
encouraged by unusually strong demand for the Treasury's auction of
new four-year notes.
   Sugar futures prices bounced sharply higher after the
Agriculture Department predicted world sugar consumption would
outstrip production for the sixth straight year. Elsewhere, oil
futures fell; grains and soybeans, livestock and meat, and precious
metals were mixed.

<HEAD>Survey Finds East Bloc Consumers Recognize Brand Names</HEAD>

   East Bloc consumers recognize a wide range of
Western brand names even though many of the products have not been
actively marketed or may not be available in their countries, a
survey says.
   The results suggest East European countries that are opening
their borders to trade may be particularly appealing to Western
companies looking for new markets, the brand management consulting
firm that conducted the survey said.
   ``We found an overwhelming recognition of brands in what are not
market economies,'' Stewart Owen, an executive of San
Francisco-based Landor Associates said Wednesday.
   ``Very few Russsians have ever seen a Honda or a Toyota, yet
they seem to have a very clear image of it,'' he said.
   The report was based on interviews with 1,500 consumers in the
Soviet Union, Poland and Hungary. Five hundred people in each
country were given lists of 400 global brand names and asked to
identify the ones they recognized and how they felt about them. The
interviews were conducted in April and May.
   Sony, the Japanese electronics brand, scored highest on a scale
that combined recognition and perceived quality among consumers in
the Soviet Union and Poland, the survey said. Sony placed fourth in
Hungary, where German automaker Mercedes-Benz topped the list, it
said.
   Ford was the lone American company to make the top 10 lists in
all three countries. Fanta and Pepsi-Cola joined it among the top
10 in the Soviet Union.
   The survey said Soviets were able to identify an average of 100
brand names, while Poles were familiar with 175 and Hungarians with
about 250. The differences were attributed to the degree of
exposure to Western media.
   Although the numbers of familiar brands were far lower than the
thousands American consumers can identify, Owen said they are
``still amazingly high'' considering each country has had a closed
economy until recently.
   ``Very few of those products are for sale there, very few of
them could be afforded there and very few have ever been seen
there,'' he said.
   ``It is very clear to us that people who are going to invest to
create these brand images have a great potential there,'' he said.
   Landor said the survey also turned up a ``disturbing
undercurrent'' relating to American brands.
   Landor president Don Casey said many American brands scored much
lower when ranked by perceived quality than on the basis of mere
consumer recognition.
   Among soft drink companies, for instance, Pepsi-Cola ranked
sixth and Coca-Cola ninth in terms of recognition in Poland. But
Pepsi dropped to 34th and Coca-Cola was 26th when ranked by
perceived quality.
   In Hungary, the differences were even more striking. Pepsi-Cola
was fourth and Coca-Cola was fifth in terms of recognition, but
Pepsi dropped to 74th and Coke fell to 47th in terms of perceived
quality.
   Owen said one explanation may be that luxury goods have an
inherent advantage over soft drinks in terms of how they are
perceived.
   But Casey said there was no such gap for Japanese or Western
brands.
   ``It suggests that American companies must quickly address the
perception of their product quality in Eastern Europe or risk
losing ground to European or Japanese competitors,'' he said.

Statements</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq has warned Kuwait and the United Arab
Emirates to curb their excess oil production and called for a sharp
rise in world oil prices, a newspaper reported.
   The moves represent a challenge to Saudi Arabia's leadership in
setting oil policy in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, The New York Times reported in Thursday's newspaper.
   The warning from President Saddam Hussein said the two small
Persian Gulf nations were harming Iraq's vital interest, as well as
those of the oil cartel, by exceeding their OPEC production quotas,
the newspaper reported.
   Iraq, which has emerged triumphant from its war with Iran, has
been trying to anoint itself as the leading military, political and
economic power in the Middle East.
   The warning was in a letter delivered Tuesday by Iraq's deputy
prime minister, Saadun Hamadi, to the Emir of Kuwait, Sheik Jaber
al-Ahmed al-Sabah, the Times said, quoted Arab oil industry sources.
   Hamadi also was quoted in Gulf newspapers as saying that oil
prices should rise to $25 a barrel from about $14 a barrel
currently, the newspaper said. OPEC's official target price is $18
a barrel.
   Oil industry officials estimate that Kuwait and the UAE are
exceeding their production quotas by a combined total of nearly 1.4
million barrels a day. Overall OPEC output recently has been about
23.5 million barrels a day, compared with the cartel's official
ceiling of 22 million barrels.

<HEAD>Reform Bills Increasing SEC Powers Advance in House</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bills giving the Securities and Exchange
Commission authority to curb penny stock fraud and other illegal
activities have moved a step closer to becoming law.
   The House Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees the Wall
Street regulator, voted Wednesday to send the Penny Stock Reform
Act and the Securities Law Enforcement Remedies Act to the full
House for consideration.
   The penny stock bill, introduced just two months ago, would give
the SEC power to bar crooked promoters and consultants from selling
the highly speculative stocks that usually sell for a dollar or
less.
   Rep. Matthew J. Rinaldo, R-N.J., a co-sponsor of the bill, noted
that ``the speed with which we have moved'' to get the bill through
committee ``underscores the depth of concern in Congress about this
problem.''
   Penny stocks are not traded on most stock exchanges. Most
information about the low-priced and often risky securities comes
from the brokers who sell them. While not illegal, penny stocks _
which typically are used to finance new or small companies _ are
considered to be chancey investments at best.
   The penny stock bill would allow the SEC to:
   _Close a loophole that now allows unscrupulous penny stock
brokers to evade SEC banishment from the securities business by
calling themselves promoters or consultants, whom the SEC has no
power to regulate.
   _Tighten disclosure requirements for highly speculative
investments known as ``blank checks'' and ``blind pools.''
   _Facilitate at ``the earliest feasible time'' an automated stock
quotation system to help investors keep track of penny stocks
nationwide.
   The proposed legislation is supported by the SEC, the Consumer
Federation of America, and the North American Securities
Administators Association, a state-level stock regulators group
that estimates American investors lose about $2 billion a year to
penny stock scams.
   The committee also approved the remedies act, which would widen
the SEC's authority to seek court orders imposing civil fines and
barring convicted securities law violators from serving as officers
or directors of companies whose stock is publicly traded.
   An earlier version of the bill would have given the SEC direct
authority to bar miscreant officers and directors, but it was
softened at the request of SEC officials, who said only federal
judges should have that authority.
   The SEC, which now can seek fines only in illegal insider
trading cases, could ask a judge to impose fines of up to $100,000
against an individual and $500,000 against a company. Another
provision of the bill would give the SEC power to order alleged
wrongdoers to ``cease and desist'' illegal activities without first
having to go to court and obtain a restraining order.
   ``This cease and desist authority is similar to that granted the
banking regulators in last years savings and loan legislation,''
said Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., a co-sponsor of the bill.
   The remedies bill was introduced by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich.,
chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee.

<HEAD>Bank To Pay $8 Million in Largest-Ever Student-Loan Fraud Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Florida Federal Savings Bank, once among the
country's top providers of guaranteed student loans, has been
ordered to pay $8.2 million for cheating a federally-backed loan
program.
   Senior U.S. District Judge Ben Krentzman sentenced the thrift
Wednesday to pay $6 million in restitution and an additional $2.2
million in fines. The judge could have imposed fines of up to $21.5
million
   Florida Federal and two of its student-loan executives were
convicted last month of conspiring to submit 17,000 fraudulent
claims for government reimbursement on defaulted student loans
worth $35 million.
   The thrift doctored documents to show attempts to collect the
loans when in fact no efforts had been made, the government said.
   The St. Petersburg-based thrift received some $18 million from
the U.S. Department of Education before payments were halted.
Prosecutors said it was the largest federal student-loan fraud case
ever prosecuted.
   Prior to the sentencing, the government had collected about $11
million from the thrift.
   Two thrift executives also were sentenced Wednesday.
   Robert O. Harmas, 42, of Noblesville, Ind. received two years in
prison and James. J. LaMantia, 59, of Largo, was sentenced to three
years probation.
   Harmas, a vice president and operations manager in the student
loan department, had faced as much as 240 years in prison and fines
of more than $10 million. LaMantia, collection manager of the
division, faced up to 165 years and $7 million.
   A federal jury convicted the thrift and Harmas on all 43 counts
of fraud, conspiracy and theft. LaMantia was found guilty on 23 of
the counts.
   Florida Federal was the third-largest provider of student loans
in the country from November 1986 to July 1987, the period covered
in the indictment.
   At the time some 11.7 percent of its assets _ or $642 million _
were student loans, the government said.
   Prosecutors said that instead of contacting students who failed
to pay back their loans, Florida Federal employees faked doing the
work. Then after the falsified data was put into a student's file,
the thrift submitted the information for reimbursement from the
education department.

   New Venture Gear Inc., the first joint

   New Venture, a joint effort between Chrysler Corp. and General
Motors Corp. announced Wednesday a four-year deal to supply parts

   New Venture will make five-speed manual transaxles for Rover's
new 825 Turbo Diesel cars. Rover is headquartered in Birmingham,
England. Transaxles are a combination transmission-axle for
front-wheel drive cars.
   The transaxles are built at New Venture's New Process Gear plant
in Syracuse, N.Y. Edwin C. Zimmerman, New Venture's vice president
of operations, said Chrysler had been negotiating with Rover for
two years.

   Democrats at the budget summit are responding
to President Bush's easing of his no-tax stance by discussing
possible cuts in some of their favorite benefit programs, including
Social Security.
   The closed-door talks between leading lawmakers and White House
officials resume today, a day after the bargainers accelerated
their pace and plunged into specific suggestions for saving
billions of dollars next year. No agreements were reached, but
participants said real work was finally being done.
   ``Whatever deadlock there was in our negotiations has
disappeared,'' said Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M.
   The talks began in mid-May. They had inched along until Bush's
declaration on Monday that ``tax revenue increases'' _ along with
spending cuts _ had to be a part of any deficit-reduction package.
   On Wednesday, Democrats presented a menu of cuts in a wide range
of benefit programs that one official said would save $5.7 billion
and another said could produce $10 billion in savings. The
officials spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Democrats have long been protective of benefit programs _ called
entitlements _ because the poor and elderly who are covered tend to
support their party.
   ``Today, we Democrats are raising the whole question of
entitlement programs,'' said Senate Budget Committee Chairman James
Sasser, D-Tenn. ``That's a very sensitive area for Democrats.''
   Overall, the negotiators are seeking $45 billion to $60 billion
in savings for fiscal 1991, which starts Oct. 1.
   Officials said that among the options were a three-month delay
in the annual cost-of-living increases in benefit programs for
which people qualify automatically, such as Social Security. That
one-time postponement _ from next Jan. 1 to April 1 _ would save
the government $3 billion next year.
   The proposal ran into flak from Domenici and House Ways and
Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill. People at the
meeting said Rostenkowski told his fellow negotiators that
``death'' would be the political consequence of adopting the idea.
   Other options discussed included:
   _Boosting from 50 percent to 85 percent the amount of income
subject to federal taxes earned by couples receiving Social
Security and earning more than $32,000 annually. The increase would
raise $3.1 billion for the government next year and $54 billion
over five years.
   _Medicare reductions.
   _Cuts in spending on various federal employee benefit programs.
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., the lead
Democratic negotiator, said there was a consensus that bargainers
should try to concoct a plan that would balance the budget by
fiscal 1995.
   That would be two years after the Gramm-Rudman law requires the
deficit to be eliminated.
   ``It's fair to assume ... that the targets are going to be
changed,'' Domenici said.
   Outside the bargaining room, however, members of both parties
clung to partisan positions on the questions of taxes.
   Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., and 12 of his 44 Senate GOP colleagues
signed a letter saying the deficit must be controlled ``through
spending reductions and economic growth, not through tax
increases.''
   On Tuesday, 90 of the 176 House Republicans signed a similar
note.
   Democratic leaders said they remained unconcerned about the
petitions, saying unhappy lawmakers might change their minds if tax
hikes were part of a solid deficit-reduction package that included
spending cuts.
   But other Democrats sought to use the GOP disarray to their
party's advantage.
   ``How is the president going to lead the country if he can't
lead his own party?'' Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., asked on the
House floor.

<HEAD>Subaru Maker Looks for Rescue by Nissan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Nissan executive was elected Thursday as
president of Fuji Heavy Industries Co., giving Nissan effective
control over the slumping manufacturer of Subaru cars.
   Fuji shareholders approved the selection of Isamu Kawai, former
president of Nissan Diesel Motor Co., a subsidiary of Nissan Motor
Co., during a meeting here.
   Nissan, Japan's second largest automaker, is Fuji's largest
shareholder, with a 4.2 percent stake, and its superior in a
corporate grouping, or keiretsu. Japan has many such groups, bound
together by cross shareholdings, other financial ties and common
business strategies.
   ``Fuji would have been probably taken over if it were in the
United States, and I'm sure even Nissan had difficulty deciding
whether it should acquire it,'' said Kimihide Takano, an analyst
with Chemical Securities Co.
   But, he said, Nissan chose a typically Japanese way, taking
advantage of its superior position in the group to send an
executive to exercise effective control.
   ``This way, Nissan can obtain the same economic effects as
acquiring the whole company,'' Takano said.
   He said Nissan plans to use Fuji facilities to expand its
production and to obtain Fuji's technology in the defense and
aerospace industry.
   Fuji is one of the nation's largest makers of military,
aerospace and railroad equipment, but such production accounted for
only 20 percent of the company's sales last year. Eighty percent of
Fuji's 1989 sales of 658 billion yen, or $4.3 billion, came from
automobiles.
   The 1989 sales were down 15 percent from the previous year, and
Fuji ran up nearly 30 billion yen, or $194 million, in debt in the
year.
   Meanwhile, sales of Nissan, Toyota Motor Corp., Honda Motor Co.
and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. were booming in Japan and the United
States.
   Industrial Bank of Japan, Fuji's main bank and its second
largest shareholder, with a 4 percent stake, is also sending one of
its former executives to Fuji's management.
   In a similar case, Sumitomo Bank rescued Mazda Motor Corp. 15
years ago when Mazda was in trouble.
   Until about a decade ago, Fuji's U.S. subsidiary distributing
four-wheel-drive models was highly profitable, but its sales have
plunged in the last few years. Analysts say the problem is weakness
in its sales network.
   Fuji previously had no seats on the board of Subaru of America
Inc. because it did not fully own its U.S. subsidiary. It announced
recently, however, that it had bought the rest of the shares in
Subaru of America.
   ``To tell you the truth, the situation has been very difficult
for us,'' said a Fuji official, speaking on condition that he not
be identified.
   ``Of course there is a weird feeling among us Fuji employees to
have a president from Nissan, but that's the way it goes. We have
to get over this tough time,'' he said.
   ``Mr. Kawai is familiar with our company, and he has a
reputation for reviving Nissan Diesel, which was not doing very
well before he was president, but now its doing just fine,'' he
added.
   After resigning as Fuji's president to take responsibility for
its problems, Toshihiro Tajima has taken the ceremonial position of
chairman.
   Chemical Securities' Takano said there are too many automakers
in Japan.
   ``The latest case suggests how Japanese auto industry can be
restructured,'' he said. ``Small comanies will disappear by being
merged into the big ones.''

   The stock market showed some spotty gains today,
following through on Wednesday's rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 5.69 to 2,867.82 by
11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with

   Volume on the Big Board came to 44.11 million shares at

   Buyers appeared to be encouraged by the market's steady showing
Wednesday in the face of earnings disappointments from several
large companies over the past few days.
   Analysts say traders are in a cautious mood as they await formal
profit reports for the second quarter, which will begin to flow as
early as next week.
   But some market participants evidently have opted to seek out
stocks of companies with histories of strong earnings growth and
lines of businesses that are perceived as recession-resistant.
   Worries about the business outlook, meanwhile, were calmed a bit
Wednesday when the government reported that the index of leading
economic indicators rose 0.8 percent in May.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph dipped &lsqb; to 39 as the most active
NYSE issue after a 2&lsqb;-point loss Wednesday, when the company
projected lower profits for the second quarter.
   Nike class B shares gained 2} to 76 in the over-the-counter
market. The company said its latest quarterly earnings are expected
to come in above estimates.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
.58 to 194.45. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .89 at 357.94.

<TEXT>
   Japanese and U.S. negotiators today reached an
agreement to help trim the $49 billion U.S. trade deficit with
Japan. They hailed the accord as an unprecedented step toward
easing tensions between the two partners.
   Details of the accord were to be announced later, but officials
emerging from the talks in the Foreign Ministry said there had been
compromises and cooperation. They said there was no need to
schedule further sessions.
   There had been concern that this round in the so-called
Structural Impediments Initiative might have to be continued next
week in the United States to reach agreement on a final report
about far-reaching economic policy changes.
   President Bush welcomed the accord and said ``the effects will
be beneficial for the entire world.'' In a written statement in
Washington, Bush credited the ``strong and courageous political
leadership'' of Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu for the progess
achieved.
   Linn Williams, the U.S. deputy trade representative, said Bush
and Kaifu had taken important steps, especially Bush in his
announcement of willingness to consider tax revenue increases.
   ``It is a remarkable thing that these two economies have done,''
Williams said. ``I see this as a kind of joint leadership. Japan
and the United States got together on difficult issues and worked
together constructively. We should be pleased with the efforts and
results.''
   ``Particularly Prime Minister Kaifu and President Bush can be
proud. They have done something no two other countries have done
before,'' he added.
   Bush and Kaifu talked by telephone late Wednesday about Japan's
final increased offer to boost public works spending _ a key area
of disagreement.
   Williams said the trade talks were ``an important influence'' on
Bush's tax move, which is aimed at reducing the federal budget
deficit. The deficit is regarded as a fundamental cause of the
trade imbalance, because it fuels U.S. demand for consumption and
imports from Japan.
   Raising U.S. tax revenues may thus reduce Japanese exports and
cut the trade surplus.
   Bush's announcement was followed by a Japanese compromise
Wednesday to increase planned public works spending. That might
help reduce the trade imbalance by increasing sales of U.S.
products and construction services in Japan and soaking up some
excess Japanese savings and investment funds.
   ``We have an international responsibility, and we had to
cooperate to come to a compromise,'' a senior Japanese official
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The talks had stretched from their scheduled two days to four
before they ended late today.
   ``After four days of looking at each others' faces, friendships
tend to develop,'' the Japanese official said.
   Another Japanese official said both countries had taken
politically dangerous steps. Bush risks political strife if taxes
are increased, and the Japanese worry about inflation resulting
from boosts in public works spending.
   The Japanese side added $96.77 billion to its offer on public
spending, boosting the total to $2.77 trillion over 10 years,
Japanese media reported. The U.S. side had asked for $3.22 trillion
for the decade.
   The linkage between U.S. taxes and Japanese public spending
showed, if nothing else, the interdependence of the immense U.S.
and Japanese economies.
   That interdependence was at the heart of the structural trade
talks, which also covered such Japanese issues as high land prices,
laws restricting large retail stores, collusive practices of large
business groups, pricing mechanisms and long delays in procesing
patent applications.
   On the U.S. side, the issues included the budget deficit,
measures to promote exports, training of workers and
competitiveness of U.S. products.
   The structural trade talks were launched in September. An
interim report was agreed upon in April, and the current talks
started Monday.
   Some commentators regarded the talks as dangerous because,
rather than focusing on specific trade issues, they gave a forum
for each country to criticize fundamental things in the other such
as education systems, cultural business practices and savings
habits.
   If the talks had failed, each side could have had good reason to
be more angry than ever.
   ``The more you become interdependent, the more problems you will
have,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said earlier this
week. ``But you will be more used to solving problems.''

   Kenneth M. Good wore a jogging suit the night
he clinched one of the biggest land deals of his high-flying career.
   It was January 1985 and Good was racing in fast times.
   The savings and loan money machines were in overdrive, real
estate was hot, and Florida swarmed with speculators who had cash
or knew how to get it.
   Good swaggered into town from Denver and pledged nearly $38
million cash for 5,400 acres of Spanish moss-draped woodlands north
of Tampa. Plans for fine homes, offices and a high-brow country
club were envisioned.
   Five years later, the unfinished Tampa Palms development is
controlled by two banks and up for sale, another victim of a
faltering real estate market. Good says his net worth has plummeted
from $100 million into the red.
   Congressional investigators have grilled Good about links to the
failed Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association of Denver
and a scandal that has ensnared President Bush's son, Neil.
   ``I feel no shame,'' the 45-year-old Good told the House Banking
Committee recently. ``Shame implies guilt. I think I was as much a
victim of the markets as anyone else.''
   The saga of Ken Good is a microcosm of the S&amp;L crisis: risky
ventures, free-spending splendor, collapse.
   Deeply indebted to Silverado and others, Good managed to
convince the financially troubled owners of the Tampa site that he
was their savior.
   People familiar with the negotiating session said Good attended
the final signing in a jogging suit, a symbolic reflection of his
go-go personality. But ultimately, he came up with less than half
the $38 million he promised. Site owners agreed to let him finance
the rest.
   He then used Tampa Palms as collateral for loans and a $70
million high-risk ``junk bond'' issue to finance other ventures,
including the $250 million debt-financed takeover of Gulfstream
Land &amp; Development Corp, one of Florida's major builders.
   Good looked like the best thing that ever happened to Tampa
until his mounting debts and the slowing real estate market toppled
his empire.
   ``What can you say? It's the story of the last couple years,''
said James Apthorp, a former Gulfstream executive kept on as
consultant at Tampa Palms after foreclosure.
   Good, a Methodist minister's son raised in a Kansas farm town,
followed prosperity around the nation with what acquaintances call
a barnstormer's zeal.
   In 1969, he formed Good Financial Corp. in Dallas and began
amassing properties before a slump in the late 1970s. Stuck with
dozens of sites and no buyers, Good dissolved the company in 1979
and moved to Denver.
   It was in the shadow of the Rocky Mountains that Good honed his
flamboyant personality and enlarged his network of high-profile
connections.
   Good helped found a home-building company, Talley Corp., which
became one of Denver's most successful developers. He resigned as
chairman and sold his share for an undisclosed amount in January
1986, just before the end of Denver's oil boom. Talley liquidated
later that year.
   Meanwhile, Good had become a star in Denver's social scene. He
tossed money to charities and sipped champagne with the city's
elite. A lavish party marked the opening of his $10 million
mansion, decorated with contemporary art and expensive furniture _
later used as collateral for real estate deals.
   Good's circle of influential friends included Neil Bush, a
Silverado director. Years later, the links between the two were
still strong.
   Documents filed with the House Banking Committee show Good's
Silverado debt was reduced by $8 million shortly after Gulfstream
agreed to invest more than $3 million in JNB Exploration Co., an
oil and gas partnership managed by Bush.
   The transaction also reduced Bush's personal liability in a line
of credit for JNB. Bush, who appeared before the House panel in
May, denied any improprieties in the deal.
   Silverado, seized by federal regulators in December 1988, has
been the target of some Democrats who question whether the
administration moved too slowly against the thrift and are too
lenient with Neil Bush. Thrift regulators have denied the
allegations, but decline to specifically discuss the case.
   Silverado lost an estimated $31 million on Good's speculative
investments in Colorado. Cost of the Siliverado bailout is
estimated at $1 billion.
   ``He has an uncanny sense of timing for business,'' Bush said of
Good two years ago. Bush did not return telephone calls for comment
on this article.
   Good swept into Tampa in late 1984 unknown, but quickly crafted
a reputation as a free-wheeling visionary. He billed Tampa Palms _
strategically located near an interstate highway _ as one of the
``best pieces of dirt'' east of the Mississippi and a future
national showplace.
   His image was further enhanced by the quick acquisition of
Gulfstream, based in Plantation, Fla., upping his portfolio to more
than 30,000 acres.
   He poured money into Tampa Palms, adding a fancy clubhouse and
exquisite landscaping. He staged grand news conferences each step
of the way and cultivated the local press with personally guided
tours of the property.
   He was toasted by politicians, courted by the chamber of
commerce and revered as a deity by fellow developers. A builder at
a trade meeting, where Good was a guest speaker, introduced him
simply as ``Mr. God.''
   He wore silk suits and drove a maroon Maserati. Weekends might
find him flying to Monte Carlo or New York aboard his six-seat
private jet. On election night in 1988, Good flew to Houston for
President Bush's victory party.
   Good's own party in Tampa soured with the economy. Tampa Palms
sales slowed, business relocations fell through, lenders pressed
for payments. It was Dallas and Denver all over again. Ironically,
billboards for Tampa Palms proclaim, ``It Only Happens Once.''
   Good himself dismissed talk of his demise. In one of his last
public speeches, in May 1989, Good labeled the rumors ``cocktail
conversation'' and unveiled plans for other projects.
   In March, a group of lenders and junk-bond holders agreed to
swap more than $200 million in debt for control of Tampa Palms,
other properties and Gulfstream. Good was ousted from the company.
   During negotiations, the lenders forced Good to stay away.
   ``They would not even let him in the room,'' said Apthorp.
``They had so lost confidence in him.''
   Meanwhile, Good faced bank foreclosure on his posh Tampa Palms
home, averted only by a last-minute payment. His Denver home
fetched $3.3 million at an auction last October.
   Good has pulled up stakes again, this time to New York. He's
expressed interest in becoming a commodities broker.
   Reached in New York by telephone, Good said he now ``never
comments to the press.'' Good's attorney, Gil Thurm, said he has no
comment on his client.
   ``I really don't know what his plans are,'' said Charles Knight,
a Tampa real estate appraiser and friend of Good's. ``But a man
that's been able to do what's he's done _ you're not going to keep
him down.''

   The stock market eked out a slight gain today,
following through on Wednesday's rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 19.80 on Wednesday,
rose 1.48 to 2,863.61 by noontime on Wall Street.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 6 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with
689 up, 581 down and 557 unchanged.
   Buyers appeared to be encouraged by the market's steady showing
Wednesday in the face of earnings disappointments from several
large companies over the past few days.
   Analysts say traders are in a cautious mood as they await formal
profit reports for the second quarter, which will begin to flow as
early as next week.
   But some market participants evidently have opted to seek out
stocks of companies with histories of strong earnings growth and
lines of businesses that are perceived as recession-resistant.
   Worries about the business outlook, meanwhile, were calmed a bit
Wednesday when the government reported that the index of leading
economic indicators rose 0.8 percent in May.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph dipped &rsqb; to 38} as the most

   The Norweigan government said it may fight
an extra import duty the United States begins imposing Friday on
Norwegian farmed salmon.
   The U.S. government established the temporary 2.45 percent
additional tariff in response to U.S. fish farmers' concerns. They
complained Norwegian farmers can export fish at unfairly low prices
because they allegedly receive state subsidies, a Norwegian foreign
ministry statement said.
   The ministry said Norway may appeal the penalty under the terms
of the international General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   Norway exported 13,000 tons of its 100,000 tons of farmed salmon
to the United States last year, according to the national news
agency, NTB.

   Stock prices finished lower on London's Stock

the market.
   Dealers said there wasn't much enthusiasm to buy shares before

<HEAD>Britain Accepts EC Judgment on ``Sweeteners'' in Rover Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain on Thursday said it had accepted a
judgment by the European Commission against the government's
inclusion of ``sweeteners'' in selling the state-owned Rover
automobile group to British Aerospace PLC.
   Trade Secretary Nicholas Ridley said although the government
differed on some details of the EC's rulings, it would support the
EC's jurisdiction in the matter by accepting the judgment in
general.
   Ridley said the department would take up its differences with
the EC after consulting with British Aerospace.
   The commission ruled in Brussels Wednesday that the Department
of Trade and Industry illegally granted 44.4 million pounds, or $77
million, in aid when it sold Rover to British Aerospace for 150
million pounds, or $261 million, in July 1988.
   The commission, which seeks to enforce fair competition in the
European Community, decided the sweeteners were illegal, hidden
state subsidies.
   The aid consisted of delayed payment of the sale price, under
which British Aerospace benefited an estimated 33.4 million pounds,
or $58 million; and 11 million pounds, or $19 million, provided to
the two companies to offset the cost of buying a small number of
Rover shares left in public hands.
   The commission ordered the British government to recover 42.9
million pounds, or $75 million, of the aid from British Aerospace
and a further 1.5 million pounds, or $2.6 million, from Rover.
   British Aerospace had no immediate comment, a spokeswoman said.

   Recession has rolled across some regions and may

no area is dragging now as much as New England, one of the
brightest stars of the 1980s boom. This second part of a four-part

   The go-go days of booming economies in
the Northeastern states are gone-gone. The ``Massachusetts
Miracle'' is a mirage. As Bill Mallon found, even some Salvation
Army shelves are nearly bare.
   Mallon said he made $75,000-a-year as a self-employed carpenter
three years ago. But by last November, there was no work at all for
Mallon and many like him.
   As a last resort in his direst moment, he turned to the
Salvation Army one day recently, seeking canned goods to help feed
his disabled wife and three children, and money to pay his utility
bills.
   ``When your children say, `Hey Dad, there's no food in the
house, I'm her the horse
was gone _ are pressuring bankers to deny credit to deserving
borrowers.''
   In economic theory at least, limits on credit supplies are
supposed to serve useful purposes even as they inflict pain.
   If banks won't lend, for example, to developers of condominiums,
shopping centers and office buildings, says Edward Yardeni,
director of economics at Prudential-Bache Securities, there may be
good reason for that reluctance: ``There is a glut of these
projects all around the country. We simply don't need any more
condos, strip malls and office space.''
   Should the economy keep sending out signs of weakness, however,
pressure on the Fed to change its position almost certainly would
increase.
   At the moment, says Mitchell Held at Wall Street's Smith Barney,
Harris Upham &amp; Co., ``that fine line between slow growth and
recession seems to be getting even finer.''

<HEAD>Earnings Up at General Mills, Conagra in 4th Qtr</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The food giant ConAgra Inc. said Thursday its fourth-quarter
earnings rose 12.5 percent to a record, while General Mills Inc.
said its earnings more than doubled in its fourth quarter from
year-earlier results depressed by losses from discontinued
operations.
   ConAgra, which is based in Omaha, Neb., said its earnings for
its latest fiscal year rose 17 percent and expects another year of
record earnings for 1991. The company agreed on June 7 to purchase
Beatrice Co. for $1.34 billion in cash and stock.
   Minneapolis-based General Mills, which markets Big G cereals and
Betty Crocker foods and operates the Red Lobster restaurant chain,
said its earnings rose 19 percent in its latest fiscal year.

<HEAD>ConAgra</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ConAgra said it earned $73.5 million, or 59 cents per share, in
the three months ended May 27 compared with $65.4 million, or 53
cents a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue for the quarter rose 35 percent to $4.01 billion from
$2.97 billion a year earlier.
   For the fiscal year, ConAgra said it earned $231.7 million, or
$1.87 per share, compared with $197.9 million, or $1.63 a share, a
year earlier.
   Revenue for the year rose 36.7 percent to $15.5 billion from
$11.34 billion a year earlier.
   The main reason for the big increases in sales for both periods
was the inclusion of results from a company formerly known as Swift
Independent Packing Co. ConAgra acquired the 50 percent share it
did not already own in that company during the latest fiscal year.
Reults from that unit are included in the latest fiscal year's
results but not in results from fiscal 1989.
   The company said its operating profit in its biggest operating
segment, prepared foods, rose 19 percent for the year to $349.2
million on a 56 percent sales increase to $11.03 billion.
   Among its brands are the Healthy Choice line of frozen foods and
it markets fresh beef, chicken, turkey, pork, dairy and food oils
products.
   For the current fiscal year, ConAgra's chairman and chief
executiuve, Charles M. Harper, said the addition of Beatrice will
``improve ConAgra's food chain balance and the overall stability of
our business mix.''

<TEXT>
   General Mills said it earned $75.3 million, or 93 cents per
share, in the three months ended May 27 compared with $35.6
million, or 45 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Fourth-quarter sales rose 19 percent to $1.71 billion from $1.44
billion a year earlier.
   Results from the final quarter of 1989, however, included a
$22.1 million loss on the discontinued operations of Talbots and
Eddie Bauer clothing chains, York cafeteria-style restaurants and
Vromans frozen foods.
   Compared to General Mills' continuing operations in last year's
fourth quarter, earnings jumped 26 percent from $57.7 million and
sales grew 19 percent to $1.71 billion.
   For the year, General Mills said net earnings dropped 8 percent
to $381.4 million, or $4.64 a share, from $414.3 million, or $5.06
a share, a year ago.
   Sales rose to $6.46 billion, up 14.9 percent from $5.62 billion
a year ago.
   Chairman Bruce Atwater said consumer foods, the division which
accounts for 70 percent of the company's total sales, had an 18
percent increase in operating profits for the year and a 31 percent
increase for the fourth quarter. Sales of Betty Crocker products
jumped 11 percent on the year, led by growth in Hamburger Helper
and several snack food lines, he said.
   Big G cereals, including Cheerios and Wheaties, grabbed 27
percent of the $7 billion retail ready-to-eat cereal market reached
in fiscal 1990, about 2.5 points higher than the prior year,
Atwater said.
   Restaurants owned by General Mills, including Red Lobster and
Olive Garden, had 19 percent sales growth to $1.93 billion for the
year while operating profit leaped 21 percent to $154.2 million.

   SupeRx Corp., a chain of 130 drug stores in four states, sought
bankruptcy protection after government regulators who seized the
firm's main lender were unwilling to renegotiate debt.
Chicken-chain El Pollo Asado was forced to liquidate after
regulators cut off financing.
   ``They made a bad situation a whole lot worse,'' said Ron
Paradise, former president of El Pollo Asado. ``All we needed was
another 30 days to put a reorganization plan in place.''
   Seven of Arizona's 10 S&amp;Ls are controlled by the federal
government, which must sell or dispose of $15 billion worth of
assets in the state. A survey by the accounting firm Kenneth
Leventhal &amp; Co. found the worst shortage of credit in Arizona in
nearly two decades.
   ``We're virtually redlined in terms of new financing,'' said
former Phoenix Mayor Terry Goddard, now a gubernatorial candidate.
   But across the country in Washington, talk of a credit crunch is
dismissed by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman and the
most powerful banker in the country.
   Nonetheless, Greenspan acknowledged to Congress last month, some
lenders have tightened their practices, and ``this cautious stance
in the granting of credit could cumulate to threaten the economic
expansion.''
   Whatever it's called, the declining availability of credit
doesn't seem to have drastically affected consumer spending, at
least not yet. Consumers account for much of the nation's economic
activity.
   Findings of the University of Michigan's respected Survey
Research Center, for example, show many consumers remain upbeat in
their outlook.
   ``Consumers say these are good times, in contrast to the
volatile 1970s,'' said survey director Richard Curtin. ``After the
'70s, slow and steady are not viewed as negatively as what they
might have been.''
   But viewed another way, Curtin's survey barely gets 50 percent
of consumers polled to say these are good times. Another prominent
consumer survey produced by the Conference Board, a New York
business research group, shows consumer confidence dropped
significantly in June, the first serious decline this year.
   ``For those who like to categorize things as boom or bust, this
is difficult because it's neither,'' Curtin said. ``One of the
reasons it's not (a severe bust) is because we didn't go into an
excessive boom.''
   Confident consumers have kept up their spending ways, even as
their personal debt load has increased. Eggert said that's one
reason the economy shows signs of strength.
   ``We're avoiding a recession by spending,'' Eggert said. ``One
of the reasons for our prosperity is that all three groups _
government, consumers and business _ are still borrowing.''
   To some economists, whether the economy is truly in a recession
boils down to a question of words, definitions and interpretations.
   ``We are limping along, and that's different than being
crippled,'' said Brusca. ``It really is a game of semantics. But to
some, being in a little bit of a recession is like being a little
bit pregnant.''

   A contract to oversee the near-doubling of
Saudi Arabia's oil production capacity is the biggest project for
engineering and construction giant Fluor Corp. in a decade.
   Officials at the Irvine-based company and Saudi Arabia's
state-owned Aramco put no exact value on the contract, awarded
Wednesday.
   Published reports quoted industry analysts saying the contract
could be worth $2 billion to $5 billion.
   But Fluor said Thursday the reports could be misleading. It said
in a news release that the program still is being defined and work
will be released in phases over five years.
   ``Certainly, this is the most significant contract we have
received in more than a decade,'' said Les McCraw, Fluor's vice
chairman and chief executive.
   But McCraw added: ``While we are extremely pleased to be a part
of Saudi Aramco's comprehensive expansion program it's premature to
speculate on its ultimate value to Fluor and its shareholders.''

   Corn futures prices rallied strongly late in
Thursday's session on the Chicago Board of Trade ahead of an
Agriculture Department report that was expected to show a drawdown
in the U.S. corn stockpile.
   Wheat futures closed moderately lower; soybeans ended narrowly
mixed.
   The Agriculture Department's quarterly grain stocks report,
which was released after the closed, showed corn stocks at 2.84
billion bushels as of June 1, slightly below the expected 2.86
billion bushels and well below last year's 3.42 billion on the same
date.
   Soybean stocks were near expectations at 596 million bushels;
wheat stocks were higher than expected at 535 million bushels.
   A USDA report on planted acreage showed farmers planted more
corn and fewer soybeans than traders had expected.
   Corn futures also were supported by expectations that no
delivery notices will be posted Friday against the soon-to-expire
July contract, an indication of strong domestic demand for the
grain.
   At the close, wheat futures were 1{ cents to 3 cents lower with
the contract for delivery in July at $3.31 a bushel; corn was 2
cents to 9 cents higher with July at $2.96 a bushel; oats were {

were 1 cent lower to 1 cent higher with July at $6.07{ a bushel.

   President Bush on Thursday hailed a trade
reform agreement with Japan as ``an important framework'' for
reducing the $49 billion U.S. trade deficit with Tokyo.
   The president said he welcomed the joint report Thursday by U.S.
and Japanese negotiators in Tokyo. In it the two countries
identified internal economic practices that hinder open trade, took
corrective actions, and ``made commitments to take further steps to
resolve a wide range of structural problems,'' Bush said in a
written statement.
   ``We expect that the structural policy actions to be taken will
have a positive effect on our economies, encouraging open and
competitive markets, promoting sustained world economic growth,
contributing to a reduction in global payments imbalance, and
enhancing the quality of life in both Japan and the United
States,'' he said.
   Further, the president said in the statement, the U.S.-Japan
agreement will benefit ``the entire world.''
   Bush was expected to discuss the matter further on Saturday when
he meets with Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu in Houston
where both are attending the economic summit of industrialized
nations.
   The agreement Thursday emerged from a series of complex
negotiations called the Structural Impediments Initiative, or SII,
involving the removal of barriers to open trading.
   The joint report in Tokyo followed Bush's acknowledgment this
week that new taxes may be needed to reduce the U.S. federal
deficit, a key factor in getting the agreement, officials said.
   The announcement that the president would consider such taxes
was followed by a Japanese compromise Wednesday to increase planned
public works spending. That might help reduce the trade imbalance
by increasing sales of U.S. products and construction services in
Japan and soaking up some excess Japanese savings and investment
funds.
   ``As Japan tackles its structural problems,'' Bush said in his
statement, ``so must the United States.''
   The president said he wants to work closely with Congress in the
ongoing budget negotiations to strengthen public and private
savings and lower the deficit.
   ``Both our governments recognize that further effort will be
necessary in order to address fully these structural problems and
to maintain the momentum of our adjustment efforts,'' Bush said.
   Bush lauded Kaifu for his personal efforts in fashioning the
agreement and for ``strong and courageous political leadership.''

   The declining presence of coffee in American
diets has marketers scrambling for ways to attract younger drinkers
and to expand in overseas markets.
   The impact of the decades-long slide in U.S. coffee drinking was
highlighted Wednesday when Maxwell House announced plans to close a
50-year-old coffee roasting and grinding plant in Hoboken, N.J.
   The company, a division of Philip Morris Cos.' Kraft-General
Foods International, blamed declining consumption for the move.
   Americans drank an average of 1.75 cups of coffee per person
last year, down from a peak in 1962 of 3.12 cups per day, according
to the London-based International Coffee Organization. The
organization represents coffee-producing countries such as Brazil
and Colombia.
   ``People are moving from hot, acrid drinks to sweet, cold
drinks. I think they will continue to do so because of our
lifestyle. People don't want to sit around blowing on coffee or
tea,'' said Jack Maxwell, an industry analyst for Wheat First
Securities Inc.
   In 1962, nearly 75 percent of Americans drank coffee regularly,
according to the coffee producers' group. By 1988, the percentage
was 52.5 percent. And the fraction of people aged 20 to 29 who
drink coffee fell from 80 percent in 1962 to 35 percent last year.
   ``I think it really has more to do with the quality of the
coffee, which has not been as high in the last 20 years,'' said
Steven Gregg, marketing director for the organization's Coffee
Development Group. ``And it's an image problem. Coffee has not been
marketed to younger people as soft drinks have.''
   The collapse last July of an international coffee-price treaty
briefly slowed the decline in consumption, said Celeste Georgakis,
a commodities analyst for Cargill Investor Services Inc. The
futures market price fell at that point from $1.20 a pound to 68
cents, although it since has rebounded to the 86-cent range.
   ``Even that did not stimulate consumption, because the younger
generation has turned to soft drinks,'' Ms. Georgakis said.
   Soft drink makers have been working to exploit declining
interest in coffee by trying to win a place on breakfast tables.
Pepsi-Cola Co. last year began test marketing in Waterloo, Iowa,
for Pepsi A.M., which has more caffeine than regular Pepsi but less
than coffee.
   ``A.M. has been going well,'' Pepsi spokesman Tod MacKenzie
said, although he said the company hasn't decided whether to market
the product nationwide. He also said the company was testing
advertising that pitches regular Pepsi as a morning drink in Fort
Wayne, Ind.
   For several years, market leader Coca-Cola Co., has provided its
bottlers with advertising for use at their discretion that promotes
``Coca-Cola in the morning.''
   Gregg said his group is trying to attract younger drinkers by
promoting flavored coffees and unusual blends.
   ``Over the last five years, growth rates for specialty coffees
are estimated at 15 to 25 percent a year,'' Gregg said. ``We're
particularly doing a lot with iced coffee. We're seeing a lot of
success with local entrepreneurs and some of the larger companies
getting into iced coffee products.''
   Overseas, where the coffee market still is growing, Maxwell
House is introducing new instant coffees in Europe and has formed
joint ventures with Japanese and Korean food companies, Maxwell
House spokesman Richard Collins said.
   ``In China, we have a small business. A few months ago, we
introduced 100 percent Colombian coffee,'' Collins said.
   Philip Morris also has agreed to buy the Swiss company Jacobs
Suchard, the world's third-largest chocolate and coffee group, for
$3.8 billion.
   Among the largest coffee marketers, Philip Morris, whose brands
include Yuban, Master Blend and Sanka as well as Maxwell House, is
tied for leadership of the market with Procter &amp; Gamble Co.'s
Folgers brand.
   Wheat First's Maxwell estimates each held about a 32 percent
share of the $3.9 billion U.S. coffee market last year.
   Nestle held a 13.5 percent share of the market with its Hills
Brothers and Chase &amp; Sanborn brands, according to Maxwell. All
other makers, including Chock Full O' Nuts and Butternut, totalled
22.2 percent of the market.
   ``I think the big guys are going to continue to do well. There
are a lot of others who are disappearing, and they are a large
percentage of the total,'' Maxwell said.

   A name partner in a Manhattan law firm was
charged Thursday with allegedly using inside information to make
$34,000 in illegal trading profits in the stock of WearEver-Proctor
Silex Inc.
   In a civil complaint filed in U.S. District Court in New York,
the Securities and Exchange Commission accused attorney Henry A.
Singer of violating insider trading laws in 1987.
   According to the SEC, Singer, a partner in the firm of Morrison
Cohen Singer &amp; Weinstein, was retained as counsel by WearEver's
board to consider offers to acquire WearEver, a Glen Allen,
Va.-based electrical appliance maker.
   The SEC charged that Singer, 52, of Harrison, N.Y., while in
possession of confidential corporate information about pending
deals to buy the company, bought WearEver stock in the fall of 1987
and sold it on or about April 8, 1988.
   WearEver was acquired by NACCO Industries Inc. on April 15, 1988.
   Singer's lawyer could not be reached immediately for comment,
but Singer's law firm issued a statement.
   ``Despite the overwhelming evidence that there was no improper
trading, the SEC is pursuing a civil action against Mr. Singer,''
the firm said in a statement issued by managing partner, Robert
Stephan Cohen.
   ``The SEC's decision to file a civil suit is inexplicable. We
are convinced, without any doubt whatsoever, that Mr. Singer did
not violate, either intentionally or inadvertently, any SEC rules
or regulations.''
   Cohen added that ``the firm stands behind'' Singer.

   Stock prices advanced steadily today, following
through on Wednesday's rally.
   Buyers appeared to be encouraged by the market's rise Wednesday
in the face of earnings disappointments from several large
companies over the past few days.
   Analysts say traders are in a cautious mood as they await formal
profit reports for the second quarter, which will begin to flow as
early as next week.
   But some market participants evidently have opted to seek out
stocks of companies with histories of strong earnings growth and
lines of businesses that are perceived as recession-resistant.
   Worries about the business outlook, meanwhile, were calmed a bit
Wednesday when the government reported that the index of leading
economic indicators rose 0.8 percent in May.

   Webster's defines recession as ``a period of
reduced economic activity.'' Federal economists, however, have more
technical definitions. Today's weak economy may not qualify as an
official recession, but for millions of Americans, this year feels
an awful lot like a recession, at least of the dictionary variety.
This first of a four-part series examines the nation's ``Unofficial
Recession.''

   Richard Lyon and his son tried to make a living
with a two-truck shipping company. But bills outran them, the
business shut down, and Lyon drove straight into bankruptcy court.
   Don't tell him the economy's not in a recession.
   ``We're just one of the statistics now,'' Lyon shrugged.
   R.A. Ballard went from building 78 homes a year here in 1986 to
six this year. The three savings and loans that financed him each
were declared insolvent and seized by federal regulators. He's
found it difficult to borrow more money.
   ``I have essentially closed my company down,'' said Ballard, a
director of the National Association of Home Builders. ``I thought
it was only happening to me. I thought it was isolated to Texas,
Arizona and some other problem areas. But it's not. It's happening
everywhere.''
   A recession? Not based on officially sanctioned economic
statistics. They show the U.S. economy continues to eke out slow
growth, prolonging the longest peacetime expansion in history.
   But in some regions, such as the Northeast and parts of the
Sunbelt, local economies have slipped dramatically. In some
industries, most notably housing, a recession is clearly underway,
many economists say.
   For millions of Americans, from clerks in debt-laden retail
stores to defense industry machinists facing unemployment, and
truckers and builders like Lyon and Ballard, the times feel like a
recession _ an unofficial recession.
   ``Official proclamations aside, I think for certain sectors and
certain states, it is a recession,'' said Robert Brusca, chief
financial economist at Nikko Securities Co. International in New
York.
   ``This is not a typical business cycle recession, but the
regional problems may finally drag down the rest of the country,''
said Albert Sindlinger, a forecaster whose Wallingford, Pa. firm
tracks ``household liquidity'' as a measure of the economy's health.
   Sindlinger's survey predicted the last two recessions when it
found more than 50 percent of U.S. households responded negatively
to at least one of his key questions dealing with household income,
jobs and business conditions.
   That happened again for the first time in January.
   ``Historically, every time that we've had the nation with over
50 percent of the population in recession, that was the month that
the government later issued a declaration saying that was when the
recession started,'' Sindlinger said.
   Consider:
   _ The Labor Department reported no job growth in the private
sector during March, April and May.
   _ An official forecasting gauge called the index of leading
economic indicators has remained sluggish this year. The gross
national product, the broadest official measure of economic
activity, has been growing at less than a 2 percent annual rate
since October, one of the slowest periods since the 1982 recession.
   _ New home sales have fallen for six months, also to the lowest
level since the recession year 1982. The auto industry is stalled
and defense contractors are laying off thousands.
   _ Bankruptcies are growing. They range from the huge corporate
variety resulting from junk-bond debt like that of Federated
Department Stores, to the personal variety resulting from
unemployment or too many bills.
   _ The latest report on regional economies by the Federal
Reserve, the nation's central bank, said most are weak or growing
only slowly.
   Still, the Fed's periodic assessment released late last month
found healthy economies in the northern Midwest and the Pacific
coast states.
   Moreover, economists say key ingredients are missing to lay the
groundwork for a recession _ most notably the high inflation that
causes interest rates to jump sharply and bring business to a halt.
They also say the economy today is far more diversified than in the
past.
   ``If the economy was still as heavily dependent on housing and
autos as it was in the '60s and '70s, then I'd say we're in a
recession. But it's not,'' said Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
economist Edward Yardeni, who coined the term ``rolling recession''
to describe the regional downturns that have swept across the
country in recent years.
   ``I would still characterize it as a rolling recession,''
Yardeni said. ``If you want to find recession, you can find it. But
it's not economy-wide.''
   The National Association of Business Economists still predicts
the economy will skirt a recession through 1991. Economist Robert
J. Eggert, whose Sedona, Ariz., firm compiles the Blue Chip
Consensus forecasting report, agrees.
   ``I feel very strongly that we will not have a recession as a
nation this year or next,'' said Eggert. On the other hand, he
said, ``recession-like conditions are likely to prevail in some
industries and regions of the nation. It's going to seem like a
recession to some people.''
   It seems that way in Kevin O'Brien's business, which grew by a
record 18 percent last year, and this year is up 24 percent over
that pace. Customers line up before opening and use a night-drop
slot long past closing. The number of employees has nearly tripled
in four years.
   O'Brien's shop isn't the hippest high-tech firm or video store.
He's the clerk for the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Phoenix, now one of
the busiest in the nation.
   By the looks of the rows of people poring over stacks of
bankruptcy documents, you might say the local economy was in a
recession.
   But like the rest of the nation, Arizona's economy is growing
sluggishly. A few office buildings are still under construction in
Phoenix. State unemployment is running around 5.3 percent, about
the national average.
   ``It is a very soft economy here,'' said Ron Simon, economist
with the Arizona Department of Economic Security. ``Within Arizona
you could say that construction and related industries are in a
recession, but overall, we are still growing as a state, so we are
not in a recession as a state, but it's fragile.''

<HEAD>Kodak Would Sell Assets if Polaroid Damages Top $2 Billion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastman Kodak Co. would consider selling
off assets if it is fined more than $2 billion for infringing on
Polaroid Corp.'s instant camera patents, Chairman Kay R. Whitmore
said in an interview with Barron's magazine.
   Polaroid has asked for $14 billion in damages, while attorneys
for Kodak suggested the amount should be $187 millin plus interest.
Industry analysts say a realistic amount would be somewhere between
$1 billion and $2 billion.
   Whitmore said that he has received no indication when Judge
David Mazzone of the U.S. District Court in Boston will decide on a
damage figure. The case has dragged on since 1986, when Kodak was
barred from making or selling the instant cameras it had introduced
a decade earlier.
   Whitmore said in the June 25 edition of Barron's, the business
weekly, that Sterling Drug, the pharmaceutical company purchased by
Kodak in 1988, would be a possible sale target if the award is more
than $2 billion.
   ``I have to recognize that there is a scenario where we won't
have a choice, where I would have to sell something to raise the
cash,'' Whitmore said. ``Which one? Well, the most obvious one, the
one we just bought, is Sterling. We could get more for that today
than the $5.1 billion we paid.''
   Whitmore said Kodak would fight an award it considers too large.
   ``I can tell you if we think the award is excessive, we will
appeal,'' he said. ``It could all drag on a while yet.''
   Despite the looming damage award, Barron's expressed confidence
that cost-cutting measures will boost Kodak earnings this year,
film price increases will firm up film margins, and new camera and
film technology will bolster the company's market share.

<TEXT>
   A federal bankruptcy judge on Thursday
extended an order that allows Greyhound Lines Inc. to continue
daily operations while the company arranges to pay off creditors.
   Judge Richard S. Schmidt also gave temporary approval to the
Dallas law firm Gardere &amp; Wynne to represent unsecured creditors of
the nation's largest bus transportation company.
   Dallas-based Greyhound and its subsidiaries on June 4 filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Brownsville, where its Eagle
Bus Manufacturing Inc. subsidiary is based. The company has
suffered financially since a walkout nearly four months ago by its
6,300 bus drivers.
   The order allowing Greyhound to use operating revenues ``in the
ordinary course of business'' extends indefinitely a similar
temporary order the judge approved at a June 7 hearing.
   Greyhound attorney Oscar Cantu estimated the company takes in
``from $1 million to several million in revenues daily.''
   Schmidt authorized Gardere &amp; Wynne to represent the creditors
until a July 12 hearing in McAllen, when he plans to take up the
matter again.
   Greyhound's June 4 bankruptcy filing included a 1,800-page list
of debt holders owed a total of about $540 million.

<HEAD>Polaroid, Minolta Agree to Produce Instant Camera</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Polaroid Corp. and Minolta Camera Co. Ltd.
said Thursday they have agreed to manufacture and distribute an
instant camera in the United States.
   Under the pact, Minolta will market in this country an instant
camera manufactured by Polaroid in Scotland. The agreement marks
the first time Polaroid instant cameras have been available under
another brand name, the statement said.
   The camera, the Minolta Instant Pro, will be distributed
beginning in August. It will include a special close-up lens
allowing picture-taking at a distance of 10 inches, Polaroid said.
   With a suggested price of $219, the camera will be geared toward
industrial and professional users, said Lee Brewer, vice president
of worldwide sales for Polaroid.
   He said the camera would open up specialty camera stores to
Polaroid. Involving another firm in the instant photographic
business was part of a strategy to stimulate Polaroid's overall
growth, he said.
   Jim deMerlier, a vice president of marketing for Minolta, said
the agreement would give his company an entree into the instant
photographic business.
   ``Minolta has been very strong in other areas, but we've never
been in instant cameras,'' he said.
   I. MacAllister Booth, Polaroid's president and chief executive
officer, said in a statement the two companies ``see this as a
first step to explore a potential long-term collaboration between
our two companies.''
   Cambridge-based Polaroid Corp. had sales of $1.9 billion last
year from its instant photographic cameras and film, and
conventional and electronic visual communications products.
   Minolta Corp. (USA), headquartered in Ramsey, N.J., is a
subsidiary of Minolta Corp. of Japan. The company has annual sales
of more than $2 billion from cameras and business equipment.

<HEAD>Rumor-Related Rally Helps Oil Prices Rebound</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices finished sharply higher
Thursday after the oil market snapped out of its recent slump.
   A rumor early in the session of Israeli military action against
Libya sparked a rally on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   As the buying waned after the rumor was dispelled, fresh news of
OPEC efforts to prop up world oil prices renewed the rally.
   The contract for August delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, jumped 47 cents to $17.15 a
42-gallon barrel, more than making up for Wednesday's 46-cent loss.
Contracts for later delivery advanced by similar amounts.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange, the
July contract of wholesale unleaded gasoline surged 1.44 cents to
60.93 cents a gallon after dropping 1.83 cents on Wednesday. Later
delivery contracts posted more moderate gains.
   The July home heating oil contract added 1.10 cents, settling at
49.03 cents a gallon following Wednesday's slide of 0.56 cent.
Subsequent contracts also rose.
   In natural gas trading, the August contract rose to $1.515 per
1,000 cubic feet from $1.500 Wednesday. The Wednesday settlement
was the lowest for the near-month contract since the New York Merc
began trading natural gas in early April. Contracts for later
delivery were mixed.
   James Steel, an energy analyst at Refco Inc., said trading
started out with a bang as a rumor that Israel had bombed Tripoli
circulated in the market. Within an hour, an Israeli government
spokesman had denied the rumor and buying interest began to fade.
   But news that the acting president of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries has scheduled further strategy
sessions with several cartel members pumped new life into the
rally. The cartel leader has had a series of meetings to discuss
ways to shore up the slumping market.
   Energy analysts said the rally caught some traders off guard.
Many of them have been shorting the market, or selling contracts in
anticipation of further price declines. The outlook for oil prices
remains bearish due to abundant supplies and sluggish demand.
   Part of the buying Thursday was technically-motivated as traders
scrambled to cover their short positions.

<HEAD>Manufacturers Hanover To Take 2nd Qtr. Charge; Analysts See
Layoffs</HEAD>

   Manufacturers Hanover Corp. said Thursday it
will take an unspecified one-time charge in the second quarter
related to a restructuring that analysts say may result in the loss
of more than 1,000 jobs.
   The charge, which did not surprise analysts, stems from the
bank's efforts to reduce expenses, according to a preliminary
prospectus covering an offering of Manufacturers Hanover preferred
stock.
   Bank spokesman John Meyers had no comment as to whether there
would be layoffs.
   But several analysts estimate Manufacturers Hanover, the
nation's eighth-largest banking concern, is attempting to slash
$100 million in annual expenses. To do so, they say, more than
1,000 jobs may have to be eliminated.
   ``Somehow all New York money center banks have got to get their
costs down,'' said Mara Hilderman, a senior analyst with Moody's
Investor Service. ``There is a problem with core profitability that
has to be improved,'' she said.
   Cutting costs appears to be easier than trying to generate
income by increasing fees and other banks have taken the same
route. Earlier this month Chase Manhattan Corp., for example,
unveiled a plan to cut $300 million in expenses, a move analysts
said could result in the elimination of 3,200 jobs.
   Manufacturers Hanover would not specify how large its charge
might be, but the prospectus said the bank expects it to be less
than operating earnings for the quarter.
   In the regulatory filing, the bank said only that operating
earnings for the quarter ending Saturday would be below the $96
million in operating earnings reported during the year's first
quarter.
   ``There was very little surprise'' with the news, said Judah S.
Kruashaar, senior banking analyst at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
   He predicted the charge would total about $50 million. ``It
won't create a quarterly loss, and very importantly it will set the
stage for the company to move ahead on impelementation this year''
of its restructuring plan, he said.
   Kruashaar also said expenses on a quarterly basis should move
lower in the final two quarters of this year.
   Manufacturers Hanover traditionally releases its second-quarter
earnings report in late July, coinciding with a regularly scheduled
board of directors meeting. But full details of the restructuring
plan might not be outlined until fall, industry watchers say.
   Manufacturers Hanover in May announced a major realignment of
its wholesale bank business that split its operations into four
groups, eliminating a layer of management. The move is expected to
result in ``significant annual savings'' in the future, the bank
said.
   Manufacturers Hanover stock slipped 25 cents to close at $34.50
a share in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Separately, the bank said it expects its non-performing assets
to increase by 15 percent ``in the near future principally as a
result of problems being experienced by one of the corporation's
major real estate customers.''
   That customer is developer Donald Trump, who missed a $30
million interest payment due Manufacturers Hanover earlier this
month.
   Manufacturers Hanover, along with Trump's other major banks
including Citicorp, Chase Manhattan Corp. and Bankers Trust Co.,
recently negotiated a $65 million, five-year bailout and
debt-restructuring deal. The deal includes delayed payments on some
debt.
   As of March 31, Manufacturers reported non-performing assets of
$1.044 billion. Trump's share will account for around an additional
$157 million.
   Kruashaar predicted the bank would be able to report relatively
flat non-performing assets, exclusive of problem loans to less
developed countries, by the end of the year.
   ``In this environment that is an exceedingly strong
accomplishment,'' he said.

   The dollar finished mostly higher Thursday in
relatively quiet trading on world currency markets.
   Gold prices firmed. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold
bullion for June delivery closed at $352.10 a troy ounce, up 70
cents. Later, Republic National Bank in New York quoted a troy
ounce of gold at $351.10, up $1 an ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT.
   Traders said much of the day's activity centered on the Japanese
yen, which got a boost early in Asian trading on the expecation
that another hike in Japanese interest rates was in the offing.
   When activity shifted westward, traders sold the West German
mark and the Swiss franc in order to buy yen, and the dollar
retreated to the sidelines.
   ``It looked as if the yen sort of caught on,'' said Curtis
Perkins, a trader at Chemical New York Capital Markets Group. He
said there was only marginal interest in the dollar.
   Volume was relatively light on U.S. markets, said Ian Spence,
chief dealer at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. Trading also was
subdued in Europe, where dealers awaited Sunday's economic and
monetary union of the two German states.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar gained against the Japanese yen,
closing at 154.42 yen, up from 154.35 yen. Later in London, the
dollar slipped to close at 153.20 yen. In New York the dollar
settled at 153.15 yen, down from 154.40 yen on Wednesday.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7400 late Thursday compared
with $1.7445 late Wednesday. In New York one pound cost $1.7384,
less expensive than Wednesday's $1.7428.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates
Wednesday included: 1.6730 West German marks, up from 1.6637;
1.4200 Swiss francs, up from 1.4095; 5.6155 French francs, up form
5.5915; 1,228.00 Italian lire, up from 1,221.50, and 1.1699
Canadian dollars, up from 1.1695.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Wednesday included: 1.6675 West German marks, up from 1.6625;
1.4125 Swiss francs, up from 1.4033; 5.6015 French francs, up from
5.5775; 1.8772 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8700; 1,224.25 Italian
lire, up from 1,217.50, and 1.1692 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1705.
   The late price of gold in London was a bid of $352.25 a troy
ounce, up from $350.05. In Zurich, the late bid was $352.60, up
from $349.90. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $350.55,
unchanged.
   Silver prices also rose. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery settled at $4.813 a troy ounce, up from $4.794 on
Wednesday. In London the metal traded at a bid of $4.85 a troy
ounce, up $4.84.

   Assets of the nation's 513 money market mutual
funds fell $444.9 million in the latest week, the Investment
Company Institute said Thursday.
   The decline, to $384.99 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a revised $1.32 billion increase in the funds'
assets the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual
fund trade group.
   The previous week's increase originally was reported as $988.6
million.
   The funds' assets hit a record high $392.14 billion in the week
ended March 21, 1990.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 250 general purpose funds rose $27.7 million to $133.99
billion, assets of 102 broker-dealer funds dropped $356.4 million
to $159.17 billion, and assets of 161 institutional funds declined
$116.2 million to $91.83 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds was
7.67 percent in the week ended Tuesday, unchanged from the previous
week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade journal
based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield also was unchanged at 7.67 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
44 days, unchanged from the previous week, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan associations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts was 6.18
percent as of Wednesday, unchanged from a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, also was unchanged, at 5.04 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.91
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, unchanged from the
previous week. Yields were 8.10 percent on 1-year CDs, unchanged;
8.10 percent on 2{-year CDs, unchanged; and 8.17 percent on 5-year

<HEAD>Some Japanese Indicate Pickens Battle Raises Important Issues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GROSS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   T. Boone Pickens Jr. failed again Thursday to
breach what he calls the closed Japanese business system.
   But his efforts to gain a greater say in management of Koito
Manufacturing Co., of which he owns 26 percent, have highlighted
the differences in how Japanese and American businesses operate.
   The battle also has begun to stimulate debate in Japan over the
pros and cons of Japan's successful but insular business culture.
   The Texan oilman has for the last year been demanding, among
other things, four seats on the 20-member board of directors of the
auto parts maker.
   At a Koito shareholders meeting Thursday, Pickens lost on that
point and on other proposals, including higher dividends and having
shareholders vote on salary and retirement benefits of board
members.
   Koito has said it could not accept on its board someone it
believed to be interested only in forcing the company to buy back
his stock at premium prices in order to keep control.
   Reacting to raucous behavior by Japanese racketeers and what he
claimed was deliberate discrimination against Americans by Koito,
Pickens stormed out of the three-hour meeting shortly before it
ended.
   ``It was a sham, an absolute farce. Here today, Koito completely
showed the world what it's all about in corporate Japan,'' he told
reporters.
   The ``sokaiya'' racketeers were incidental to Pickens' battle.
They plague many companies' shareholders meetings, buying a few
shares to gain entry and seeking hush money to allow the meetings
to proceed undisturbed.
   Behind Koito's resistance to Pickens lies stiff Japanese
corporate opposition to the strong investor control practiced in
the United States and symbolized by him. Japanese companies
frequently attempt to weaken shareholder control by transferring
much of their shares to docile shareholders who promise not to
trade them.
   They also have been able to keep shareholders happy _ despite
low dividends _ with rising stock prices that make possible large
capital gains.
   Pickens also attacked Japan's entrenched ``keiretsu system,'' in
which companies have formed closed links through shared stock,
financial and personnel links and corporate strategies.
   He said Koito, in its link to Toyota Motor Co., had its profits
squeezed by the automobile giant. Toyota owns nearly 20 percent of
its stock and buys 45 percent of its output.
   But Koito officials denied that Toyota had any control over
Koito activities. They said its large share of purchases from the
Koito reflected Toyota's overall strength in the Japanese market.
   Pickens' failure in his efforts to reduce the company's
dependence on Toyota and increase stockholders' rights came as the
United States and Japan were working out a final agreement on
reforming business practices seen as contributing to the large U.S.
trade deficit with Japan.
   Their talks, begun in September 1989, represent a recognition
that the two sides' highly divergent business cultures influence
the sales of goods and services between them.
   One of Japan's pledges was to curb exclusionary practices by
keiretsu groups.
   Japanese press reports and comments on the Koito-Pickens
controversy suggest that some Japanese are beginning to rethink the
benefits of their exclusive system.
   News Station, a popular evening news program, suggested
Wednesday that although Pickens' motives for seeking to influence
Koito were unclear, he clearly demonstrated the exclusivity of
Japanese companies.
   An editorial in the prestigious economic journal Nihon Keizai
Shimbun said earlier: ``It is a very typically Japanese phenomenon
for a company to treat unfavored shareholders coldly. If we simply
say, `When in Rome, do as the Romans do,' there will arise nothing
but friction. The Koito-Boone issue indicates a need to reconsider
the customs and practices of our corporate society.''

   Drug and consumer-products issues led the way as
the stock market posted its second straight gain Thursday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 19.80 points on
Wednesday, rose another 16.58 to 2,878.71.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
911 up, 559 down and 523 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 136.12 million
shares, against 146.62 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 162.52 million shares.
   Buyers appeared to be encouraged by the market's steady showing
Wednesday in the face of earnings disappointments from several
large companies over the past few days.
   Analysts say traders are in a cautious mood as they await formal
profit reports for the second quarter, which will begin to flow as
early as next week.
   But some market participants have opted to seek out stocks of
companies with histories of strong earnings growth and lines of
businesses that are perceived as recession-resistant.
   Worries about the business outlook, meanwhile, were calmed a bit
Wednesday when the government reported that the index of leading
economic indicators rose 0.8 percent in May.
   Pharmaceutical stocks, a favorite target lately of buyers
seeking out consistent growth companies, chalked up more gains.
Abbott Laboratories rose 1&lsqb; to 42; Bristol-Myers Squibb 1\ to 64{;
Schering-Plough 1 to 48\; Glaxo Holdings { to 28}, and Eli Lilly 2}
to 83}.
   Food and other consumer products issues that share a reputation
as ``defensive'' stocks also stood out. General Mills gained 3| to
90; Pepsico 1{ to 78; Gerber Products 2&lsqb; to 54~; Colgate-Palmolive
1 to 68~, and Procter &amp; Gamble 2 to 85}.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph dropped &rsqb; to 38} as the most
active NYSE issue after a 2&lsqb;-point loss Wednesday, when the company
projected lower profits for the second quarter.
   Pennzoil picked up 3{ to 76&rsqb;. The company said it planned to
withdraw a registration statement covering 3.69 million shares of
its stock issued as part of an acquisition made earlier in the year.
   Nike class B shares gained 4\ to 77{ in the over-the-counter
market. The company said its latest quarterly earnings are expected
to come in above estimates.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $22.79 billion, or
0.67 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
climbed 1.31 to 195.18.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 3.46 to 420.24, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 2.49 at 357.63.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
gained 3.49 to 460.38. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 358.57, up 1.52.

<HEAD>AT&amp;T to Cut Some Rates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Telephone and Telegraph Co. said
Thursday it will reduce its evening interstate long-distance rates
by about 5 percent and daytime rates by about a half-percent on
July 1 as part of a $300 million overall price cut.
   The company also will reduce the prices of operator-assisted
calls, U.S.-Canada calls and its Reach Out America optional
long-distance calling plan.
   Overall interstate calling rates will go down an average 2.2
percent, AT&amp;T spokesman Herb Linnen said.
   The cost of a 10-minute direct-dial evening call anywhere in the
country will drop to $1.49 from $1.58.
   The cuts require approval by the Federal Communications
Commission.
   The FCC last week ordered the nation's local telephone companies
to reduce by $1.1 billion, effective July 1, what they charge
long-distance companies to connect with local phone networks.
   Long-distance carriers typically pass along to their customers
savings from these reduced ``access charges.''
   Other phone companies such as MCI and US Sprint usually follow
suit to remain competitive.
   AT&amp;T, the nation's largest long-distance company, had announced
last month it would cut its rates by $160 million annually based
upon earlier requests that local phone companies had made with the
FCC.
   The local companies in April had asked to reduce their access
charges by just $405 million on July 1, but the FCC last week
increased that amount to the $1.1 billion figure.
   Before July 1989, when AT&amp;T's earnings were restricted to about
a 12 percent rate of return on its investments, the company passed
on to its customers nearly all the savings whenever local phone
companies reduced their access charges.
   But AT&amp;T now is under a regulatory scheme that controls its
prices within a prescribed range of ``caps'' tied to the rate of
inflation, not its profits. Last November, AT&amp;T raised prices for
night and weekend calling by 1.3 percent.
   AT&amp;T's residential and small business prices currently are right
at the cap, so the July 1 reductions were needed, Linnen said.
   Large business prices are well below the caps, he said.
   AT&amp;T said that on July 1 it will cut prices for:
   _Direct-dial, interstate calls between 5 p.m. and 11 p.m. Sunday
through Friday by an average 5 percent.
   _Daytime (8 a.m. to 5 p.m.) direct-dial calls by an average 0.5
percent.
   _Reach Out America evening discount plan from $8.15 to $7.80 per
hour a month and Reach Out Half-Hour plan to $4 to $4.35.
   _Per-minute operator-assisted calls an average 3 percent.
   _The first minute of Canadian calls at all times.
   The company said it would eliminate the one free call now
allowed to interstate directory service, meaning all such calls
will cost 60 cents each.
   AT&amp;T's prices have dropped nearly 43 percent since the 1984 of
the old Bell system, primarily because of FCC-ordered reductions in
access charges.

manufacturers over the next three years.
   The Japanese carmaker also said it selected five U.S.
semiconductor manufacturers to make custom electronics components

   Toyota officials announced the agreements in New York and
Washington after completing their second mission to the United
States in search of electronics suppliers.
   The five companies will work with Toyota to develop 23 types of
electronic components, including custom computer chips that control
automobile suspension systems, engines, instruments and stereo
systems. The agreements could result in more than $17 million worth
of sales over a three-year period beginning April 1, 1991, Toyota
said.
   Hiroshi Arai, general manager of Toyota's electronics
engineering division, said the company began to buy U.S.
semiconductors last year. Those sales were of off-the-shelf
semiconductor products, as opposed to the custom chips envisioned
under the new agreements.
   ``We would like to begin on a small scale and build up to a big
business,'' he told reporters, speaking through a translator. ``Our
impression is that we have been able to develop very good teamwork
with the U.S. semiconductor manufacturers.''
   About half of the types of custom components to be purchased
from the five U.S. companies would cost slightly less if they were
obtained from Japanese suppliers, Arai said. He encouraged U.S.
chip makers to improve their manufacturing efficiency to cut costs.
   Toyota would not say how much it intended to spend on each
company's products.
   James Edson, a Motorola marketing official, said the new
agreements represent an advancement over last year's pacts, which
included purchases from Motorola, because the components to be
purchased are more sophisticated.
   The components Motorola will supply will be made throughout the
world, including Japan, Edson said. Motorola, based in Schaumburg,
Ill., is the world's largest supplier of semiconductors for
automotive use.
   Though he praised Motorola's relationship with Toyota, Edson
said Toyota is not Motorola's largest customer among Japanese
carmakers. He said he could not reveal the other company.
   Millard Phelps, a technology analyst at the San Francisco
brokerage Hambrecht &amp; Quist Inc., said the automobile industry
represents an important market for U.S. electronics companies.
   Although automotive uses account for less than 10 percent of
U.S. semiconductor production, the percentage is growing rapidly as
automobile control devices become more sophisticated, he said.

<HEAD>Strife and Strike Fears Fuel Copper Rally</HEAD>

   Copper futures prices rose sharply Thursday on New York's
Commodity Exchange amid speculation of a strike at an Arizona
copper mine and supply disruptions from Zambia, the world's
sixth-largest copper producer.
   On other commodity markets, precious metals, orange juice and
energy futures advanced; grains and soybeans were mixed; and
livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   Copper futures settled 3.1 cents to 5 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July up 4.3 cents at $1.143 a pound.
   Analysts said most of the buying was caused by the threat of a
strike at Asarco Inc.'s Ray copper mine, which produces 115,000
tons of copper concentrate per year.
   Workers have set a strike deadline of midnight Saturday and
analysts saw little hope for a new contract agreement before then.
   The mine's production is substantial. But the market is in a
period of seasonally slow demand and could weather a strike of two
or three weeks comfortably, said James Steel, a metals analyst with
Refco Inc. in New York.
   ``It wouldn't matter, but that's not the way the market
reacted,'' he said.
   Copper prices also were supported by continuing unrest in
Zambia, where about two dozen people have died this week in riots
sparked by the government's abolition of food subsidies.
   The disturbances have not occurred in Zambia's two major
copper-mining areas but there is speculation the rioting might
spread, Steel said.
   In precious metals trading on the Commodity Exchange, gold
futures settled 70 cents to 80 cents higher with August at $354.10
a troy ounce; silver was 1.2 cents to 1.8 cents higher with July at
$4.813 a troy ounce.
   Orange juice futures surged on the New York Cotton Exchange as
the market continued recovering from last week's technically
inspired collapse. Thursday's rally accelerated after the July
contract surpassed $1.85 a pound, the price level that some
analysts had cited as the trigger for the recent sharp decline.
   Frozen concentrated orange juice settled 1.95 cents to 5.7 cents
higher with July at $1.879 a pound.
   Energy futures finished sharply higher on the New York
Mercantile Exchange after the oil market snapped out of its recent
slump.
   A rumor early in the session of Israeli military action against
Libya sparked a rally. The buying waned after the rumor was
dispelled but fresh news of efforts by the Organization of
Petroleum to prop up world oil prices renewed the rally.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 6 cents lower to 47
cents higher with August at $17.15 a barrel; heating oil was .85
cent to 1.1 cents higher with July at 49.03 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .50 cent to 1.44 cents higher with July at
60.93 cents a gallon.
   Corn futures rose strongly on the Chicago Board of Trade ahead
of two Agriculture Department reports. Wheat futures closed
moderately lower while soybeans ended narrowly mixed.
   The USDA's quarterly grain stocks report contained no surprises.
   But a report on spring planting intentions showed that farmers
surveyed during the first two weeks of June planned to plant more
corn and less soybeans than traders had expected.
   Corn came in at 74.6 million acres compared to market
expectations of 73.9 million; soybean plantings were projected at
about 58.1 million acres compared with an expected 59.6 million.
   Some analysts pronounced the corn number bearish and the bean
number bullish.
   ``But what will really determine the size of the crop is the
weather over the next 60 to 90 days,'' said Gerald Zusel, manager
of Balfour Maclaine Corp.'s floor operations at the exchange.
   A National Weather Service 90-day forecast released after the
close predicted above-normal temperatures and normal rainfall for
Midwestern corn and soybean areas.
   Wheat futures settled 1{ cents to 3 cents lower with July at
$3.30\ a bushel; corn was 2 cents to 8\ cents higher with July at
$2.95\ a bushel; oats were { cent lower to } cent higher with July
at $1.35} a bushel; soybeans were 3 cents lower to 1 cent higher
with July at $6.07 a bushel.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live cattle futures settled
.13 cent lower to .03 cent higher with August at 73.17 cents a
pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .25 cent higher with August
at 84.37 cents a pound; live hogs were .08 cent to .57 cent lower
with August at 58.35 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.85
cent lower to .10 cent higher with July at 59.25 cents a pound.

   Two narrow measures of the nation's money supply
increased in the week ended June 18 but a broader measure fell, the
Federal Reserve Board reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose
to a seasonally adjusted $807.6 billion from $807.5 billion the
previous week. A slightly broader measure known as M2 rose to a
seasonally adjusted $3,269.4 billion from $3,265.8 billion the
previous week.
   A broader measure, M3, fell to a seasonally adjusted $4,055.9
billion from $4,059.2 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted attention from M1 to the two broader money supply measures.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,267.3 billion, a 2.9
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,059.6 billion, up 0.7 percent, while M1
rose 3.6 percent to an average of $806.5 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks fell $92 million,
compared with a drop of $318 million a week earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $419 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, up from
$345 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $309.4 billion in the two-week period ended
June 27, up from $306.9 billion two weeks earlier.

   U.S.-based Bell Atlantic and
Telefonica of Spain were awarded Thursday a combined 60 percent
share in Argentina's state telephone company ENTel.
   President Carlos Menem signed the decree, saying the two
companies' bids were the highest when bids were opened three days

   A formal takeover is scheduled for Oct. 8. Before then, 30
percent of the new company will be offered to investors and the
remaining 10 percent given to employees.
   The private U.S. company and the Spanish state monopoly paid a
combined $214 million cash and $5 billion in debt papers for the
Argentine company that has 3 million lines and 45,000 employees.
   The companies pledged to pay $379 million more within six years,
and to invest several hundred million dollars in the new enterprise.
   ``This is a moment of triumph,'' said Menem, who has made
privatizations the centerpriece of his efforts to introduce free
market reforms to Argentina's state-dominated economy.

   A maker of aircraft windows pleaded
guilty to lying to the Air Force about flaws in windshields for the
B-1B bomber, and agreed to pay a $400,000 fine.
   The plea Wednesday by Swedlow Inc. of Garden Grove, Calif., was
made in a deal with federal prosecutors that resulted in U.S.
District Judge Alice-Marie H. Stotler dismissing three other fraud
charges against the company.
   As part of the deal in federal court in Santa Ana, the
government also agreed to drop its case against Swedlow Vice
President Norman Gene Nixon if, after one year, he is not convicted
of any other crime.
   Nixon and the company were charged with scheming to misrepresent
the seriousness of defects in four windshields. Swedlow lawyer
Dennis Kinnard said the company believed the indictment was unfair
because the flaws were too minor to impair the windshields' fitness
for flight.

   The government's top securities regulator
Thursday defended a study of last October's stock market slide
against a bitter critique by the rival Commodity Futures Trading
Commission.
   ``We stand by our report and every word in it,'' Securities and
Exchange Commission Chairman Richard C. Breeden told a small group
of reporters in his office.
   Breeden said the CFTC's study of the 1989 market mini-crash had
serious methodological defects. He likened the report to saying,
``except for the period of time between 7 a.m. and noon, Pearl
Harbor day was a good day.''
   Breeden's sharp comments came in response to a published report
of the critique by CFTC Chairman Wendy Gramm.
   In a letter to the chairman of a House subcommittee that
oversees the CFTC, Ms. Gramm called the SEC study ``misleading,''
``imprecise'' and ``contradictory.''
   The SEC regulates stocks, bonds and the exchanges that trade
them. The CFTC oversees the futures markets. The two have been
locked in a war of words over which agency has jurisdiction over
financial products that share aspects of both securities and
futures contracts.
   Both regulatory agencies studied causes of the 190-point drop in
the Dow Jones industrial average last Oct. 13, which occurred
shortly after UAL Corp. announced that a leveraged buyout had
fallen through.
   The CFTC concluded last month that index arbitrage _ a
computerized program trading strategy blamed by many for
exacerbating the 1987 stock market crash _ was not a major factor
in the 1989 stock slide. It also found no evidence of manipulation
in the stock-index futures market.
   The Bush administration is pushing legislation that would hand
over authority over stock-index futures to the SEC from the CFTC.
   Stock-index futures, often used in program trading strategies by
large institutional investors such as pension funds, allow
investors to trade on the movement of a basket of stocks without
having to buy the underlying stocks.
   Program traders try to take advantage of small price differences
between the stock and futures markets by simultaneously buying
large orders in one market while selling in the other. The SEC and
other opponents claim it causes wild price swings.
   The SEC study, also released last month, found that index
arbitrage and other program trading strategies accelerated the 6.9
percent market drop and accounted for an unusually high percentage
of share volume during the 90-minute slide.
   Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., chairman of the panel that oversees
the CFTC, asked Gramm to explain the discrepancies between the SEC
and CFTC reports.
   In a nine-page letter to English, Gramm said the reports agree
on most of the facts. But she accused the SEC of ``selectively
omitting'' critical data. ``The most obvious case is their emphasis
on sell volume and only perfunctory mention of contemporaneous buy
volume by the same trader groups,'' she said.
   Not so, Breeden said.
   ``Our report looks at trading from the moment in time in which
the UAL announcement was made until the end of the day,'' he said.
``We look at the level of index arbitrage activity and the pattern
of net activities _ buying and selling.
   ``The CFTC report chose to analyze the level of index arbitrage
averaged over the entire day. That's a little bit like saying that
except for the period of time between 7 a.m. and noon, Pear Harbor
Day was a good day and on average there weren't many problems.''
   ``There was a specific event, it began at a specific point in
time and to try and disguise the developments that occurred during
that period of time by averaging them in over a period of time that
is totally irrelevant, demonstrates the significant methodological
defects of the CFTC report,'' he said.

<HEAD>Pathe Stymied in Bid for Time Warner Loan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pathe Communications Corp. said
Thursday its attempt to get a loan from Time Warner Inc. had
stalled and it would look elsewhere for money to buy MGM-UA
Communications Co. for $1.3 billion.
   Time Warner's failure to lend Pathe $650 million is the latest
setback to efforts by Kirk Kerkorian, MGM-UA's controlling
shareholder, to sell the company.
   Pathe spokesman Craig Parsons said the company was looking at
``a broad universe of options'' for raising the rest of the money.
   ``It could take any shape _ equity, financing, investors,''
Parsons said. ``They're confident despite how this might be
perceived by others.'' Pathe has already made $200 million in cash
down payments to MGM-UA.
   Rumors had flown for weeks that Time Warner would decide against
making the loan.
   In the two years Kerkorian has had MGM-UA on the auction block,
nearly every big entertainment and media company has examined its
assets. Australia's Qintex Group agreed to buy MGM-UA for $1.5
billion last year, but was unable to arrange financing. Media mogul
Rupert Murdoch, who had offered $1.4 billion, declined to re-enter
the bidding.
   The Time Warner loan had been a centerpiece of Pathe's original
$1.2 billion, $20-per-share offer for MGM-UA. Time Warner was to
have gotten a lien on the United Artists library as security, plus
distribution rights to the library and future Pathe and MGM movies.
   But Pathe's chief, Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti, and
Kerkorian negotiated a new deal last week. The new deal was crafted
when Parretti was unable to meet a Saturday deadline for arranging
the rest of the financing to Time Warner's satisfaction. The new
deal raised the offer by $100 million to $1.3 billion.
   Time Warner had insisted that Pathe put at least $450 million in
equity into the deal, plus $150 million in equity from outside
sources. Pathe instead proposed to raise funds primarily by
borrowing money from European affiliates, although it said it
intended to convert that debt to equity by issuing stock to the
affiliates.
   The new buyout bid, which was finalized Thursday, structured the
deal as a merger rather than a tender offer and made no mention of
Time Warner.
   ``Pathe intends to continue a dialogue with Time Warner,'' Pathe
said in a brief statement. It added: ``Pathe will seek alternative
sources of financing to conclude its acquisition of MGM-UA.''
   MGM-UA spokesman Scott Tagliarino said MGM-UA would have no
comment on the latest announcement. He noted that so far, Pathe has
made all its good-faith payments.
   Kerkorian already had surrendered most of the control over his
studio to Qintex when that deal fell apart over a $50 million down
payment. Determined not to be burned again, he has made his
agreements with Parretti contingent upon a series of monthly $50
million payments, of which Parretti has made four beginning in
March.
   Another $53 million is due this month. It and the $200 million
in previous down payments will be distributed to MGM-UA
stockholders as a $4-per-share payment.
   Parretti has agreed to make additional $50 million payments in
August and September, and come up with the balance of the money by
Oct. 23.
   Investors have been skeptical about the chances of the deal
going through at its current level of $21.50 per share. MGM-UA
stock closed Thursday at $17.87{, up 12{ cents per share, on the
New York Stock Exchange before Pathe announced its negotiations
with Time Warner had stalled.

<TEXT>
   Personal bankruptcy filings nationwide rose 15
percent in the first three months of the year, led by sharp
increases in the Northeast, a financial industry group reported
Thursday.
   There were 166,694 personal bankruptcy filings in the first
quarter, compared with 144,725 in the same period of 1989, the
American Financial Services Association said.
   The increase exceeded the rate of 1989, when personal filings
increased 12 percent over 1988.
   New Hampshire led the nation with a 90 percent increase to 393
filings from 207 in the first quarter of 1989. Massachusetts
followed with a 76 percent increase.
   California, the state with the most personal bankruptcies, had
18,587 filings, a 7 percent increase over 17,431 in the first
quarter of 1989.
   The AFSA, which represents companies that provide financial
services to consumers and small businesses, based its findings on
statistics compiled by the Administrative Office of U.S. Courts.
   The 1st U.S. Circuit, which includes Maine, Rhode Island and
Puerto Rico as well as New Hampshire and Massachusetts, showed the
largest gain in filings with a 54 percent increase.
   The 2nd Circuit, which includes Connecticut, Vermont and New
York, ranked second with a 36 percent increase.
   The only judicial district to report a decrease was the District
of Columbia where there were 204 cases, down 21 percent from 259 in
the first quarter of 1989.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Bankruptcy Court, which covers the
oil-dependent states of Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, reported
only a 4 percent increase. The region had reported large increases
in previous years.

<TEXT>
   Maxwell House will close its 50-year-old
coffee roasting and grinding plant here by early 1992 and expand a
plant in Jacksonville, Fla., the company announced Wednesday.
   None of the 600 workers at the Hoboken plant would be laid off
immediately, said Raymond G. Viault, company president.
   ``People simply aren't drinking as much coffee as they used
to,'' Viault said.
   A 24 percent decline in American coffee consumption since 1963
left Maxwell House's four United States plants operating at only 55
percent capacity, Viault said at a press conference in Secaucus. In
February, parent company General Foods USA announced that either
Hoboken or Jacksonville would be closed.
   Despite workers' concessions and enticements from the city, the
company chose the 66-year-old Jacksonville site, where workers make
an average of $3 an hour less.
   As positions are phased out, workers would be offered
counseling, retraining and possible relocation to other positions
in General Foods and its parent company Philip Morris Co., Viault
said.
   Jacksonville operations manager Frank Meegan said that over the
next 18 months, new roasters and process control equipment would be
installed and production would be expanded by 40 percent.
   The plant's 380 workers cheered the news when it was announced
Wednesday afternoon.

   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange dropped
Thursday morning, while the dollar remained stable against the
Japanese yen.
   Kojiro Narimatsu, a trader with Nippon Kangyo Kakumaru
Securities Co., said the Nikkei index fell as investors stepped to
the sidelines following Wednesday's surge. The Nikkei gained 740.98
points Wednesday.
   ``Because it was not due to active selling, the index is
unlikely to fall further,'' he said.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 258.52 points, or 0.80
percent, ending the early session at 32,054.23.
   The dollar ended the morning session at 154.35 yen, unchanged
from Wednesday's close. It opened at 154.57 yen, up 0.22 yen from
Wednesday's close, and ranged between 154.27 yen and 154.63 yen
during morning trading.
   The dollar opened higher following dollar-buying in the Sydney
market, which opened earlier than Tokyo's. But the currency
weakened later as participants adjusted positions before a series
of important political and economic news scheduled for next week,
dealers said.
   Among the events are German monetary unification, the U.S.
Federal Reserve Board's open market committee meeting and the
Soviet communist party congress.
   In the bond market, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds slipped to 86.75 points, down from
Wednesday's close of 87.05. The yield was higher at 7.24 percent,
up from the previous day's 7.175 percent.
