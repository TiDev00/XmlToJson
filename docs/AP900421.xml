   John Kluge, described as the richest
American, is divorcing his wife of nine years, Patricia, a
newspaper reported.
   The Kluges will divide their 10,000-acre Albemarle Farms estate
and live in separate parts of the sprawling property southeast of
Charlottesville, The Daily Progress said in the story to be
published Saturday.
   Robert A. Blair, one of Mrs. Kluge's attorneys, told the paper
that the marriage was ending ``because of irreconcilable
differences.''
   Mrs. Kluge, 41, will live with the couple's adopted 6-year-old
son, John W. Kluge II, in the 45-room Albemarle House mansion,
Blair said.
   Kluge, 76, will reside at the adjoining 3,000-acre Morven estate
that he bought for $8.5 million two years ago.
   ``They are resolving all matters amicably and wish each other
well,'' Blair said.
   Blair would not divulge the amount of Kluge's estimated $5.2
billion fortune his wife is to receive. He also refused to say
which side would file divorce papers.
   ``I want to confirm to you that she has not been served with
papers,'' said Arnold W. Adler, a lawyer for Kluge's Metromedia Inc.
   Forbes magazine ranked Kluge as America's richest man last
October.
   The divorce will be his third and her second.

<HEAD>State Settles First of Thruway Bridge Collapse Lawsuits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state agreed Friday to pay a widow and
her two children more than $1.9 million in the first settlement of
a lawsuit stemming from the April 1987 collapse of a New York state
Thruway bridge.
   Ten people died when the four-lane bridge along the nation's
longest toll road collapsed into the flood-swollen Schoharie Creek
about 40 miles west of Albany.
   The claim settled Friday was filed by the estate of Robert
Hoffman, a Niagara Mohawk worker killed when the car he was in
plunged into the raging waters. Also suing were Hoffman's widow,
Karen, and their two children, Scott Hoffman, 20, and Tara Hoffman,
18. The Hoffmans live in Rensselaer County.
   The family had sued the state and the Thruway Authority for
$15.8 million.
   Under the order, approved by Court of Claims Judge Louis Benza,
the state agreed to immediately pay Mrs. Hoffman $50,000 and the
Thruway Authority agreed to pay her $248,000.
   Also, the Thruway Authority agreed to structured payments to
Mrs. Hoffman and her children that, over the next 25 years, would
total at least $1.67 million.
   Nancy Connell, a spokeswoman for state Attorney General Robert
Abrams, said she expected other settlements to be reached soon on
some of the lawsuits filed by survivors of the other nine victims.
   The 559-mile New York state Thruway runs from near New York
City, north to Albany, and then west to the Pennsylvania border
south of Buffalo.

<TEXT>
   The National Whistlers Convention began as
a folksy get-together, but over 17 years it has developed into a
springboard for those who aspire to 15 seconds of stardom.
   ``All of our whistlers sooner or later get on some kind of a
show, either the Johnny Carson show or the David Letterman show,''
said Allen De Hart, founder and director of the competition held in
Louisburg, about 30 miles north of Raleigh.
   About 60 contestants from 20 states, ranging in age from 3 to
88, were competing this weekend for awards including best
supporting whistler, and prize money totaling $2,500.
   ``We have more people come from New York than any place,'' De
Hart said. ``It's a tremendous amount of fun to watch.''
   De Hart said whistling is an ancient art form.
   ``It was an means of communication probably long before we had
language. I guess the first whistler was probably the first caveman
who heard a bird,'' he said.
   Sean Lomax, the 1989 national whistling champ, is a 28-year-old
computer specialist on a submarine based at Pearl Harbor.
   He won last year's title by whistling ``Dance Boheme'' from the
opera ``Carmen,'' and ``The Entertainer,'' from the movie ``The
Sting.'' Lomax will open the contest today with the national anthem.
   After today's competition at the Franklin County Courthouse,
convention-goers will gather for a street dance. There will be arts
and crafts displays and visits to the National Whistlers Museum,
established in 1981.

   Gunmen killed a newspaper employee and a
state assemblyman and kidnapped a priest in violence in Medellin
and Cali, the home cities of Colombia's biggest cocaine cartels,
police said.
   Meanwhile Friday, authorities said they found two more bodies in
a common grave on a farm owned by Fidel Castano, a reputed member
of the Medellin Cartel, bringing to 26 the number found in the last
week on the land 310 miles north of Bogota.
   At least six of the bodies have been identified as those of
people kidnapped in the northern town of Puerto Bello. A right-wing
death squad allegedly financed by drug traffickers abducted 42
peasants from the town in January.
   In Medellin, men firing from a speeding car on Friday killed a
deliveryman for the Bogota daily El Espectador.
   Police said in a communique that there was no robbery attempt
and that the attack was considered to be yet another on the
newspaper by drug traffickers.
   Seven El Espectador employees have been murdered since
September. Drug lords said then they were declaring war on the
daily because of the paper's crusade for government action against
the traffickers.
   The paper's publisher, Guillermo Cano, was killed on Dec. 17,
1986, shortly after the newspaper started the crusade.
   Assailants in Cali shot and killed Jose Giraldo, an assemblyman
for the opposition Conservative Party in Valle State, as he arrived
at his residence in the city late Thursday, a police communique
said.
   Giraldo also served as councilman for the town of Trujillo, a
few miles outside Cali. In the last two weeks 16 people have been
kidnapped, and police blame the abductions on drug traffickers and
leftist guerrillas.
   One of the victims is the town's priest, Tiberio Fernandez,
abducted late Thursday along with three other people traveling with
him in a car, police said.
   Police said they found the bodies of four other kidnap victims
in the town on Thursday.

<HEAD>Doctor Can't Escape Recognition for Kennedy Surgery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dr. Malcolm Perry would rather be
remembered for teaching surgery than as the surgeon who worked on
John F. Kennedy in a Dallas hospital Nov. 22, 1963 and on the
president's assassin two days later.
   But history seems to be in his way.
   In an interview with The Columbus Dispatch _ his first
interview, he said, since the morning after Kennedy's death _
Perry, 60, said he avoids reading or watching programs about
Kennedy's assassination and prefers not to talk about such programs
with fellow workers.
   ``I have no desire to relive the pain,'' he said Thursday during
a break from teaching a two-day course at a vascular disease
symposium at St. Anthony Medical Center. Perry is now chief of
vascular surgery at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn.
   He said that being in Emergency Room One at Parkland Memorial
Hospital the day Kennedy was brought in was ``an accident in
time.'' The chief surgical resident who had been paged to take the
case was away that day.
   Perry said he was in the trauma room with Kennedy about 20
minutes. He finds it curious that people are so interested in those
20 minutes.
   ``I don't resent it,'' he said. ``It's a matter of proportion,
though. Things aren't real balanced in the world.''
   Perry said what he did with Kennedy was no different than what
he had done before or has done since to save others.
   ``There are only two medical emergencies: airway (obstruction)
and bleeding,'' he said. ``Mr. Kennedy had both,''
   To clear Kennedy's airways, Perry performed a tracheotomy, in
which a hole is cut in the windpipe. He said he wasn't aware of it
at the time but recalled hours later that Jacqueline Kennedy was
watching the procedure.
   ``Every time I looked up, I saw her standing there in the
corner, watching,'' he said.
   In performing the tracheotomy, Perry cut through the bullet exit
wound in the president's neck. Officials later investigating the
assassination asked why the wound wasn't measured, and why doctors
didn't turn Kennedy over to examine the wound in the back of his
head.
   Perry said legal issues never occurred to him. There wasn't time.
   ``You get the airway clear, you stop the bleeding, then you see
what else you've got,'' he said.
   Even with advances in medical technology over the past 26 years,
Perry said, the same head wound would be fatal today.
   When Kennedy was pronounced dead, Perry said he left the trauma
room and sat down but was called almost immediately to operate on
then-Gov. John Connally of Texas, who was riding with Kennedy and
also was wounded but lived.
   Two days later, Perry operated on Kennedy's assassin, Lee Harvey
Oswald, who had just been shot by Jack Ruby. Oswald also died.
   Perry said coping with his role became more difficult when he
and his family began receiving hate mail charging he was part of a
conspiracy to kill the president.
   The Warren Commission, established to investigate the
assassination, concluded that Oswald acted alone in killing Kennedy.

<HEAD>U.S. Says Soviet Economy in ``Fragile State'' and May Worsen</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union's economy turned in an
``abysmal'' performance last year and faces the likelihood of
continued inflation and shortages despite President Mikhail
Gorbachev's reform efforts, according to a U.S. intelligence
analysis.
   ``Soviet economic problems reached near-crisis proportions in
1989 as severe consumer goods shortages, inflation and rising
social and ethnic violence left Gorbachev searching for ways to put
his economic program back on track,'' said the report to Congress.
   ``The combination of inflation and shortages made daily life
miserable for all but the most privileged elements of society,''
said the joint Central Intelligence Agency-Defense Intelligence
Agency report.
   CIA Deputy Director for Intelligence John L. Helgerson told the
Joint Economic Committee on Friday that the Soviet economic
performance was ``abysmal in 1989, the worst since Gorbachev took
over'' in 1985.
   The report also noted a 4 percent to 5 percent drop in real
Soviet defense spending last year, which should strengthen the
position of those in Congress seeking larger Pentagon budget cuts.
   It forecast a ``daunting'' road ahead for the emerging
democracies in Eastern Europe, with high unemployment, price
increases and falling wages. But the analysts said Poland and other
countries are making good starts at attracting the private
investment needed for recovery.
   Helgerson said Soviet energy production dropped last year for
the first time in four decades and there were declines in the
industrial, construction and transportation sectors. Consumer
prices rose an estimated 6 percent and shoppers turned to
black-market sources for goods and essentials that were rationed.
   In an effort to meet consumer demand, the Soviets boosted
imports of some items and, coupled with a decline in oil exports,
piled up a $1.4 billion trade deficit, he said.
   Overall economic growth for 1989 was about 1.5 percent, the
report said, although it noted that figure is based on dubious
statistics and does not take into account distribution problems
that kept goods from reaching consumers.
   Helgerson said the first quarter of 1990 has not been promising,
and the prospect for ``even a modest economic recovery seems to us
remote at best.'' Inflation and shortages will probably persist, he
said.
   ``The economy in fact could deteriorate sharply,'' Helgerson
said. ``It is in a fragile state and a severe shock could cause
output to drop precipitously.'' Shocks could come from ethnic
unrest, strikes or consumer panic, he said.
   On Wednesday, Secretary of State James A. Baker III told the
House Ways and Means Committee the Soviet reform effort is
sporadic, poorly designed and hampered by bureaucratic resistance
and lack of public acceptance.
   Gorbachev will continue to shift his country's military
production machine into making consumer durable goods to cope with
the problems, said Helgerson and Dennis M. Nagy, a senior DIA
official.
   Cuts in troops and conventional arms Gorbachev announced more
than a year ago ``are well on their way'' to accomplishment, Nagy
said. The DIA believes at least half the promised tank reductions
and about three-fourths of the artillery and combat aircraft
reductions have been made, he said.
   The value of Soviet military aid to Third World countries
dropped last year to $17 billion, about $2 billion below the
previous year's figure, said Nagy. Lower shipments to Iraq and
other Middle East states accounted for the drop, he said.

<TEXT>
   A woman whose account of Sen. Robert F.
Kennedy's assassination touched off conspiracy theories has been
charged with embezzling $9,800 from a councilwoman's campaign funds.
   Sandra Serrano Sewell, 42, of Pasadena, was expected to
surrender sometime next week on one felony charge of grand theft by
embezzlement, Deputy District Attorney Steven E. Weiss said Friday.
   Sewell allegedly took the money while bookkeeping for the
Committee to Re-Elect Gloria Molina in 1985. The alleged
embezzlement was discovered during a routine audit by the state
Fair Political Practices Commission two years later. The
councilwoman took the case to the district attorney's office.
   Sewell gained fame in 1968 when she claimed to have seen a woman
in a polka-dot dress running from the scene of Kennedy's
assassination at the Ambassador Hotel, shouting, ``We shot him. We
shot him.''
   Sewell, then Sandra Serrano, said that when she asked the woman
who was shot, the woman replied, ``Senator Kennedy.''
   Sandra Serrano was questioned at length by police officers and
her interviews comprised a large portion of long secret
investigative reports in the case released in 1988.
   Police files released that year showed that the woman withdrew
her statement two weeks after the June 5, 1968, killing, saying,
``The whole thing was a lie.''
   But her story was often resurrected by conspiracy buffs who
suggested the woman in the polka-dot dress was part of an
assassination plot. Sirhan B. Sirhan was convicted of Kennedy's
killing and is serving a life sentence.
   Sewell declared in 1988 that police had harassed her into into
recanting.
   ``There was a lot of badgering that was going on. I was just 20
years old, and I became unglued ... I said what they wanted me to
say,'' she said.
   Police dismissed the woman's badgering allegations.
   ``She did not tell the truth,'' said Cmdr. William Booth,
spokesman for the Police Department.

<HEAD>Darman Criticizes Democratic Budget, Renews Call for Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Congressional Democrats are putting together a
1991 budget that ignores a flagging economy and relies in part on
dubious savings, the White House budget director says.
   The budget chief, Richard Darman, said Friday that Democratic
spending plans under consideration are ``not implementable''
because they fail to take administration preferences into account.
   But also said the attitude of leading congressional lawmakers
toward budget negotiations with the administration is improving.
   ``It's highly likely we could move to negotiations in a matter
of weeks,'' said Darman, who has been pressing for such talks since
President Bush submitted his 1991 spending plan in January.
   Darman's comments, made in a session with reporters, marked a
continuation of his attempt to insert the administration into
Democratic efforts to write a budget for the year that begins Oct.
1.
   The House Budget Committee adopted a Democratic-written $1.24
trillion budget on Thursday, and the panel's Senate counterpart
plans to begin its own work next week.
   Darman called the House document ``a slide-by budget'' lacking
serious deficit reduction, the same criticism Democrats have
leveled at the White House's own plan.
   He said the Democratic plan, which claims to reduce next year's
deficit by $36 billion, relies on $9.3 billion in savings that
Democrats themselves have called questionable. These include
improved tax collections, user fees that have been rejected before
and ``interesting other gimmicks,'' he said.
   Darman said the Bush administration now believes next year's
deficit will be $8.5 billion to more than $20 billion worse than
the $100.5 billion shortfall it projected in January. He attributed
this to the economy's worse-than-expected performance in recent
months.
   The Gramm-Rudman law sets a $64 billion shortfall target for
fiscal 1991.
   Darman criticized Democrats for not adjusting their proposal to
account for the poorer economic figures. The Democratic plan calls
for $36 billion in deficit reduction, rather than the minimum of
$45 billion Darman said is really needed.
   When President Bush introduced his budget in January, Capitol
Hill Democrats said he had used unrealistic economic projections.
   ``They were right,'' Darman said. But he added that in writing
their own budget package, ``They have decided they will ignore
that.''
   The better the economy performs, the more taxes the government
collects and the smaller the federal deficit.
   House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., flew
back to his district Friday and could not be reached for comment.
But after his panel approved the Democratic fiscal package on a
party-line 21-14 vote Thursday, he said he could defend the plan
``very strongly.''

   Paul McCartney says rock stars are
singing more about ecological issues because world leaders aren't
doing enough to protect the earth's environment.
   ``Governments _ especially George Bush and Margaret Thatcher _
aren't doing enough work,'' the former Beatle said at a news
conference Friday.
   The 47-year-old singer, his wife, Linda, their children and his
band have been in Rio since Wednesday for two shows expected to
break attendence records.
   Jeff Baker, McCartney's press spokesman, said 150,000 tickets
were sold for Friday's show and all 175,000 tickets were sold for
today's concert at Rio's Maracana soccer stadium, the world's
largest arena. Previously, the largest crowd to watch McCartney in
concert numbered 80,000.
   The Rio shows were to close a 33-city world concert tour. But
McCartney told reporters he was considering proposals to extend the
tour to Liverpool, England _ the Beatles' hometown _ in May.

   Jim Whittaker, the first American to reach the
summit of the world's highest mountain, will return to the Mount
Everest International Peace Climb expedition after hurting his leg.
   Whittaker, 61, of Port Townsend, will direct a group of
American, Soviet and Chinese climbers to the top, the expedition's
officials said in a statement. He plans to return to the mountain
on Thursday.
   Whittaker was forced to leave the expedition two weeks ago
because of a severely torn muscle in his left calf. He has received
medical treatment in Katmandu, Nepal. Deputy expedition leader
Warren Thompson led the climb in Whittaker's absence.
   Dianne Roberts, Whittaker's wife and the climb's executive
director, said the climbers expect to make attempts on the
29,028-foot summit about May 1.
   The expedition's goal is to place an American, a Soviet and a
Chinese climber together on the summit and, during descent, collect
trash and debris left by previous climbers on the mountain. The $1
million expedition began in February.
   Whittaker reached the top of Everest in 1963.

   ``Chattahoochee,'' a new movie based on
Chris Calhoun's efforts to reform inhumane and brutal conditions at
Florida State Hospital, is helping the former mental patient
fulfill a goal he set when he was released 28 years ago.
   ``I promised those who were left behind that I would let the
world know what happened there,'' Calhoun said in an interview
Friday.
   The film, named for the Florida Panhandle town where the
hospital is located, about 40 miles northwest of Tallahassee,
opened Friday in Los Angeles and New York and is scheduled to begin
appearing nationwide May 11.
   Although fictionalized, it is based on the real-life experiences
of Calhoun, a Korean War veteran who was suffering from what now is
known as post-traumatic stress syndrome.
   Calhoun, 56, was committed in 1956 after he shot himself in a
failed suicide attempt, and was released in 1962 after an
investigation spurred by letters he wrote that were smuggled from
the hospital.

   The district attorney's office said three
physicians who treated Elizabeth Taylor overprescribed narcotics
for the actress but will not be criminally prosecuted.
   ``It is clear that the prescribing practices of these physicians
fell below the accepted standard of medical practice,'' Deputy
District Attorney Daniel Feldstern wrote in a report on Drs.
William Skinner, Michael Gottlieb and Michael Roth.
   ``However, it is equally clear that these physicians, in trying
to resolve the patient's medical condition, were also attempting to
deal with her addiction through alternative means of therapy and
treatment, and that their conduct was lacking in the requisite
criminal intent.''
   The district attorney's office will refer the case to the state
medical board.
   In 1983, Miss Taylor acknowledged a 35-year addiction to
sleeping pills and painkillers prescribed for health problems, and
she was treated at the Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage for
alcohol and drug abuse.
   She was treated by the three doctors in 1987 and 1988. Among
drugs Skinner prescribed were Demerol, Percodan, Valium, Ativan,
Xanax, Preludin and Dilaudin.
   On Friday, meanwhile, Miss Taylor, 58, was in stable condition
with pneumonia at St. John's Hospital and Health Center in Santa
Monica.

   New U.S. visa regulations leave the door open
for suspected Nazi war criminals to enter the United States, say
officials who have intercepted about 12 of them trying to get into
the country in recent months.
   Those caught were West Germans took advantage of a program
enacted last summer which allows residents of West Germany to enter
the United States without a visa.
   Previously, West Germans had to apply for visitor visas at a
U.S. consulate, where their applications were checked against the
thousands of names on a ``watchlist'' of suspected Nazi war
criminals.
   Under the program, visitors are now screened when they reach a
U.S. airport or border crossing. Their passports are then checked
against an Immigration and Naturalization Service computer list of
people ineligible to enter the United States.
   But officials say some probably get through, either because of
inefficiency or work overload.
   Neal Sher, who heads the Justice Department's Nazi-hunting
office, said he expects an increase in the number of interceptions
as the summer tourist season begins.
   He said the changed visa rules tie up his time with calls from
various airports where inspectors have stopped people with names
corresponding to those on the watchlist.
   Sher said a man who recently arrived at Boston's Logan Airport
on a Saturday night _ after winning a free trip to the United
States that included a cruise from Florida _ was found to have been
extradited to Poland in 1947 from the U.S. zone of West Germany for
suspected involvement in Nazi atrocities.
   ``We put him on a plane home the next morning,'' Sher said.
   But with the dropped visa requirement, ``the last line of
defense has become the first,'' Sher said.
   Sher said some take a chance on slipping past passport control.
   Last Saturday, he said, another West German's name popped up in
the INS computer when he arrived at the airport in Fort Lauderdale,
Fla.
   Sher said he went to his office and found the man had been a
guard at a Nazi death camp. Under questioning, which Sher directed
by phone, the man admitted he had an underarm tattoo of the elite
Nazi SS unit.
   ``Needless to say, he never got to see Florida, either,'' said
Sher.
   Although Sher has complained to other government agencies
involved in the program, the State Department said it was ``very
satisfied'' with the visa waiver scheme.
   The INS said some 121,000 West Germans entered the United States
between July and December in 1989. Only 46 West Germans were
refused entry, among them about a dozen for suspected Nazi activity.
   The watchlist, compiled by the Justice Department, includes
names of people ineligible to enter the country for various
reasons, including suspected criminal or terrorist activity.
   People are placed on the list who are suspected of complicity
with Nazi war crimes, but they are not necessarily considered
indictable in the United States.
   When the Justice Department has evidence about a watchlist
suspect which it believes is sufficiently grave and irrefutable, it
informs West Germany or other countries that may want to prosecute.

<HEAD>Anne Frank Museum Expanding To Accommodate Growing Popularity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Anne Frank Museum, which
includes the cramped attic in which her family hid from the Nazis,
will expand to accommodate surging popularity among tourists.
   ``The space we have now is literally too small for all the
visitors,'' Marie Josee Rijnders, coordinator of the expansion
project, said Friday.
   The museum is made up of two canal houses that have become the
nation's most visited historic landmark.
   The young Jewish girl's writings during her time in hiding,
``The Diary of Anne Frank,'' gained her worldwide fame after her
death in a Nazi concentration camp.
   Officials say a new building will be constructed next to the
museum at a cost of $3.2 million and will quadruple the exhibition
area.
   The expansion is expected to take at least six years to complete.
   Officials expect about 640,000 visitors this year, 40,000 more
than last year.
   An average of almost 2,000 visitors a day jam into the museum to
see the cramped attic where the Frank family lived for two years
before being captured in 1944 and sent to concentration camps.
   Known to readers of Anne Frank's diary as the ``annex,'' the
apartment is entered through a door hidden behind a bookcase.
   ``Anne Frank's house is the most popular historical landmark in
the Netherlands,'' said Amsterdam tourist bureau spokesman Herman
ter Balkt. ``It's no wonder they're in dire need of more room.''
   Before the Nazis invaded the Netherlands in 1940, the building
on the Prince's Canal housed the spice business of Anne Frank's
father, Otto. The house next door was taken over by the private
museum foundation to add exhibit space.
   The hiding place is the museum's focal point. The rest of the
complex is devoted to exhibitions dealing with the ordeal of the
Frank family and other Dutch Jews, as well as exhibits detailing
other forms of racism.
   ``The museum shouldn't just refer to the past,'' Ms. Rijnders
said. ``Our aim is to combat present day forms of discrimination,
anti-semitism and racism.''
   Plans to add to the museum had initially drawn protests from
neighbors and the National Monument Preservation Service, but they
were withdrawn when the foundation running the museum limited the
expansion to a separate, new building.
   The foundation had initially sought to rebuild a house next door
into a viewing gallery from which visitors could look out onto the
loor apartment where the Frank family hid. But opponents said the
redesign would ruin the authenticity of the hideaway.

<HEAD>Government May Ease Blood-Donor Ban Used Because of AIDS Risk</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal health officials say they will
probably ease a policy that bars blood donations from all Haitians
and black Africans, who were considered at high risk for carrying
the AIDS virus.
   Immigrants from Haiti and from sub-Saharan Africa say they are
unfairly stigmatized by the ban, which they claim has no scientific
basis.
   ``Our blood is as safe as anybody else's blood,'' Alix Mathieu,
a University of Cincinnati medical school professor who is Haitian,
told a Food and Drug Administration advisory committee on Friday.
   ``The scientific facts are not very hard,'' he said, urging
``that we be considered as any other Americans.''
   The panel of experts recommended the blood-donor exclusion be
dropped and the FDA instead develop screening questions and
procedures to identify those Haitians and black Africans who are at
high risk for AIDS.
   Dr. Paul Parkman, the FDA's AIDS coordinator, said the agency
will likely make some changes in the policy. But he noted that
while three panel members approved the recommendation, two others
voted for a less drastic course.
   ``We're inclined to change'' the policy as long as the safety of
the nation's blood supply can be maintained, Parkman said. ``But we
need to think a little bit about what each of (the committee
members) said.''
   The difficulty, FDA scientists say, is the virus is spread among
Haitians and sub-Saharan Africans chiefly through heterosexual
contact. They say it is more difficult to identify risk from
heterosexual contact than risk from homosexual contact or
needle-sharing by intravenous drug users, which is how the virus
usually spreads among black, Hispanic and white Americans.
   But Haitian-Americans, AIDS activists and the American Red Cross
urged the agency to find some way to screen for high risk donors
without stigmatizing whole segments of the population.
   ``It is a racist behavior,'' said Brunir Shakelton, executive
director of the Cambridge American Haitian Association.
   Several dozen Haitians attended the meeting at the FDA's
headquarters in nearby Rockville, Md. At the same time in New York,
50,000 Haitians and African Americans protesting the ban rallied in
lower Manhattan, closing the Brooklyn Bridge for more than two
hours and tying up traffic around City Hall.
   All donated blood is tested for the AIDS virus before it is
used, but an infected person may not test positive for six months
after they contracted the virus.
   The ban has been in place, in part, since 1984, when Haitians
who had emigrated to the United States since 1977 were excluded
from the list of eligible donors. Central Africans were added in
1986 and that was extended to include immigrants from sub-Saharan
Africa and nearby islands. Haitians and sub-Saharan Africans who
had emigrated before 1977 were added in February.
   The panel voted after several dozen Haitians told the FDA
committee they consider the ban discriminatory. Witnesses said the
policy has cost Haitians their jobs and homes.
   Parkman said he was inclined to allow Haitians who came to the
United States before 1977 to donate blood as scientific evidence
indicates those who emigrated after that have most of the cases of
AIDS.
   For sub-Saharan Africans, he said he was inclined to allow them
to donate blood if a blood bank has the ability to test donors for
the HIV-2 virus as well as the HIV-1.
   The HIV-2 virus is a less common cause of AIDS. There is
currently no test in the United States for detecting the evidence
of HIV-2, but some tests are in development.

<HEAD>Prosecutors: D.C. Mayor `Quite Adept' at Smoking Crack Cocaine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Marion Barry spoke of previous cocaine
use and put some crack in his jacket pocket the night the FBI
arrested him for smoking the drug, prosecutors say.
   In court papers, prosecutors said the District of Columbia mayor
and ex-model Rasheeda Moore ``talked of their previous times
together including their past cocaine experiences'' when they met
in a hotel room Jan. 18.
   The U.S. Attorney's office filed the papers Friday in opposition
to Barry's motion for dismissal of drug and perjury charges against
him. Barry argues his right to due process was violated because the
government ``manufactured the crime'' against him.
   But the prosecutors said Barry's ``conversation confirms that he
had drugs on his mind as soon as he arrived'' in the room at the
Vista International Hotel, where the mayor was the target of an
undercover sting operation.
   ``Once he was alone in the room with Ms. Moore, he asked her in
their coded vocabulary if she was still using drugs,'' said the
filing.
   Once crack cocaine was obtained from an undercover agent posing
as a friend of Moore's, Barry ``took a portion of the crack and
placed it inside his jacket pocket which was hanging on a door knob
nearby,'' said the papers.
   According to the prosecutors, Barry made several unsuccessful
attempts to get Moore to smoke the crack. It was the mayor who
``walked over to the pipe, arranged the crack in the pipe, produced
a cigarette lighter and lit the crack in the pipe.''
   The mayor ``inhaled deeply on the pipe and held his breath,''
said the prosecutors. ``After exhaling ... (he) again inhaled
deeply on the pipe and held his breath. After taking two hits from
the pipe, he put on his jacket and called his security officer by
walkie-talkie as though he was ready to leave.''
   Law enforcement officers then entered from an adjoining room and
arrested the mayor.
   Barry ``asked for the crack; he eagerly accepted it; and he
appeared to be quite adept at smoking it,'' the prosecutors said.
   The prosecutors also said that at the start of their
conversation, Barry ``indicated'' to Moore ``he wanted cocaine
powder, not crack.'' But when the undercover agent left the room to
get powder, Barry told Moore to get crack instead, said the court
filing. Moore called the undercover agent back in the room, Barry
gave money to Moore, and Moore bought a bag of crack.
   Barry faces trial June 4 on five counts of cocaine possession
and three counts of allegedly lying to a federal grand jury by
denying he had been involved in drugs with Charles Lewis, a former
city employee. Lewis is now the government's chief witness against
the mayor.

   Martin Vanden Eykel II was told to beware
the mountain.
   The Army doesn't know whether the helicopter pilot from Illinois
slammed his aircraft into rock or was killed by enemy fire during a
night mission in Vietnam.
   But on Friday, nearly 21 years his death, his remains and those
of three fellow soldiers were buried at Arlington National Cemetery.
   ``The void will always be there because I lost my son,'' said
Wilma Vanden Eykel. ``But I'm glad that instead of wandering the
jungles for 20 years he is with the Lord.''
   The remains of her son, of Wheaton, Ill., were buried with those
of William D. Sanderlin of Fort Worth, Texas, Michael H. Shanley
Jr. of La Mesa, Calif., and William C. Dunlap of Tucson, Ariz.
   An Army band marched to the grave, leading the horse-drawn
carriage that carried the casket. On an otherwise cool and cloudy
day, the sun suddenly appeared as the band leader raised his baton
for ``Amazing Grace'' and the mourners settled in velvet-covered
chairs.
   The chaplain, Lt. Col. John W. Morrison, said a short prayer and
blessed the casket. A group of soldiers fired three loud volleys,
and a bugler followed with ``Taps.''
   ``We still have a great pain in our hearts for all the boys who
are still missing in Vietnam,'' said Maury Vanden Eykel, brother of
the fallen pilot.
   ``We'd like to see some answers for their families, too,'' he
said.
   On Dec. 2, 1969, Vanden Eykel and the other soldiers were aiding
American ground troops by firing flares during night combat.
Another helicopter on the same mission warned that both aircraft
had to change course to avoid a mountain.
   Vanden Eykel, 26 at the time, said he felt dizzy. He
acknowledged the warning, but his helicopter soon disappeared. It
was never found despite a four-day search.
   Vietnam returned 25 sets of American remains in January 1989.
The identities of Dunlap, a chief warrant officer, and Sanderlin, a
staff sergeant, were confirmed through dental records.
   Vanden Eykel, a chief warrant officer, and Shanley, a sergeant,
have never been positively identified. But two months ago, a
military board ruled that the men's remains were included with
those of Dunlap and Sanderlin.

<HEAD>AIDS Study Finds Genetics May Determine Susceptibility</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KELLY P. KISSEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers say they've found a new link
between genetics and AIDS that could help explain why some people
become sick soon after exposure while others stave off serious
illness for years.
   In a study of 5,000 infected men from Baltimore, Chicago, Los
Angeles and Pittsburgh, those with a particular genetic background
tended to have a more rapid decline after being exposed to the
AIDS-causing virus, the researchers said Friday.
   ``It has been a point of considerable interest because the
effects of AIDS differ so widely,'' said Dr. June Osborn of the
National Commission on AIDS.
   ``The key finding is that there may be genetic differences that
you inherit that once you're infected with HIV, it increases your
vulnerability to develop severe diseases,'' said Dr. Charles
Rinaldo Jr., an assistant professor of pathology at the University
of Pittsburgh.
   AIDS researchers have long suspected that factors besides HIV
exposure determined the course of the disease. The main suspects:
genetic factors and other viruses.
   ``HIV is a necessary agent, but it may not be a sufficient cause
to develop the full-blown disease,'' Rinaldo said. ``Those
individuals with these cofactors may get the disease more readily.''
   From its original pool, researchers from the University of
Pittsburgh and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases analyzed data from 108 white men who were HIV-positive,
had high levels of T4 cells _ which generate a human's immune
response and are the HIV's main targets _ and were free of AIDS
symptoms.
   The pool of men was reduced to obtain a group with similar
backgrounds. Afterward, the researchers split the smaller group of
men, placing together 49 with rapid immune system decline and 59
who remained in relatively good health.
   In the 49 whose health had declined, 20 percent had a
combination of four particular antigens, which provoke an immune
system response.
   ``There was a significant difference compared with those whose
immune status had remained stable,'' Rinaldo said.
   Isolating the genetic similarity in only 20 percent of the AIDS
victims probably indicates other factors are involved, Rinaldo said.
   Possible links between HIV exposure and genetics have come up
before, but their medical applications have been questioned, said
Dr. Jeffrey Laurence, a researcher at the Cornell Medical Center at
New York Hospital.
   ``People for years have been trying to find an association ...
and with so many conflicting results,'' Laurence said. ``I've heard
of these associations before, but they were never strong enough to
help you clinically.
   ``It's just another little piece of a very complex story. Can
you ever predict who's going to go on and develop a disease that's
going to be fatal?''
   Rinaldo said that as work progresses on other factors, doctors
will be able to make more informed decisions and possibly move away
from the current policy to give the medication AZT to any
HIV-positive person whose T4 cells are depressed.
   ``We may be able to look at different ways to approach a
prognosis and predict with a little more accuracy those individuals
who will likely do worse,'' Rinaldo said.
   But Laurence said, ``I'm skeptical that there's going to be a
big clinical payback.''
   The research team said it was premature for those at risk for
AIDS development to use the data to predict how sick they would get.
   ``We don't want guys getting very expensive tests. It's
premature to say that this is a key to whether or not you will
develop AIDS,'' Rinaldo said.

<HEAD>Air Force Discovers Cracks in B-2 Titanium</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force is investigating ``hairline
cracking'' in a rear section of the B-2 stealth bomber that may be
caused by exposure to high temperatures.
   The cracking was found during a routine inspection of the
radar-evading aircraft on March 30, Air Force spokesman Maj. Dick
Cole said Friday.
   The cracking was located behind the plane's engine exhaust
outlets.
   The problem was first reported in the magazine Aviation Week &amp;
Space Technology.
   ``They are trying to sort out exactly what caused the problem
and identify it,'' Cole said. ``They think it could be due to the
high temperatures, but they just don't know. When they identify the
fix it will be incorporated into the production'' of the aircraft.
   Cole said that in the meantime, the sections with the cracking
will be removed and replaced with new titanium patches.
   Titanium, which is highly heat resistant and is very strong,
also was used in the now-retired reconnaissance aircraft SR-71.
However, shortages of the material are plaguing the aerospace
industry.
   Cole said it wasn't clear whether the problem would delay the
plane's testing process. The aircraft, which first flew in
November, was scheduled to undergo additional flight testing this
month.
   On Capitol Hill, backing for the high-cost aircraft has been
eroding.
   Recently, one bipartisan group of senators urged cancellation as
they released a congressional study concluding that slowing down
production would raise the cost of a single plane from about $530
million to more than $1 billion.
   Acknowledging the growing opposition, Air Force Secretary Donald
Rice said that the service is reviewing possible alternatives to
buying all 132 planes now sought.

   A convicted killer who had demanded
that his lawyers halt efforts to stop his execution was put to
death early Saturday for the slaying of a Houston taxi driver.
   Jerome Butler, who had spent about half of his life behind bars,
was given a lethal injection at 12:15 a.m. and pronounced dead at
12:26 a.m.
   ``I just want to say I wish everybody a good life and things
like that. Everything is okay,'' he said. He nodded to the prison
warden and to a chaplain, coughed several times and stopped
breathing.
   Butler, whose age on record was 54 although he claimed to be
several years older, was sentenced for the 1986 shooting death and
robbery of 67-year-old Nathan Oakley of Houston. He refused any
interviews from prison.
   Butler, who has passed competency tests, was the first person to
be executed willingly in Texas since Robert Streetman ordered his
attorneys to make no further efforts on his behalf. He was put to
death Jan. 7, 1988.
   Butler was the 34th inmate to be executed since Texas resumed
carrying out the death penalty in 1982. The total is the highest of
any state. Nationally, he was the 122nd person executed since a
1976 U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowed states to resume capital
punishment.
   State corrections officials said Butler had not filed any
appeals by Friday afternoon.
   ``I just want to get it over with,'' Butler said last month when
his execution date was set. ``They could take these cuffs off me
and walk me back to (death row) and I still won't resist. There
won't be no appeals.''
   One of Butler's attorneys, Vic Pecorino, had said Butler could
be spared if he had a change of heart.
   ``Without cooperation from him, what are you going to appeal?''
Pecorino said.
   Prosecutors said Butler may have killed Oakley because the cab
driver recognized Butler as the man who killed his friend, A.C.
Johnson, in 1973. Butler served 10 years of a 30-year prison term
for that slaying.
   ``This is what I've been waiting for _ for this moment _ to know
this man can not take away another wife's husband and children's
father,'' Oakley's widow, Robbie, said Friday. ``It's been a
difficult three and a half years. I wish I could be there to see
it.''
   Butler spent 27 years behind bars, beginning with a
23-to-47-year term in New York in 1959 for robbery, attempted
sexual assault and accessory to rape. He was paroled in 1972.
   The following year he was arrested for the Johnson slaying and
sentenced to 30 years for murder. He was freed in 1984.

   It's a good bet Jerry Lewis and Jerry Erwin
aren't razor-sharp in their knowledge of the latest in shaving
technology.
   The two automobile tow shop workers haven't shaved for 27 years,
and have a $500 wager on who will stay unshaven the longest.
   Lewis and Erwin decided to grow beards for West Virginia's
centennial celebration in 1963 in honor of the Mountain State's
mountain-man heritage.
   The initial bet of $100 against the first to go clean shaven has
grown, along with their beards, to $500 ``because of inflation,''
Lewis said.
   Lewis has kept his beard trimmed to about five inches in length;
Erwin's is nine inches long. Asked to predict who will eventually
lose out, both men just smiled and stroked their chins.

   Undaunted by the Soviet Union's economic embargo
against Lithuania, Rollin Holton is pressing ahead with his Mikhail
Gorbachev Fan Club.
   The 43-year-old Honolulu painting contractor started the club in
January because he regards the Soviet leader as ``the Pied Piper of
democracy.''
   Holton says Gorbachev is not opposed to the Lithuanians forming
a breakaway republic, ``he's just asking them to do it legally.''
   Nearly two dozen people have paid the $20 fan club membership
fee, Holton said. Membership includes a subscription to the group's
newsletter, Glasnost, a membership certificate, and bumper stickers
and buttons with the phrase ``Go Gorby Go.''
   ``I'm not in this for the money, though,'' Holton said in an
interview earlier this week. ``Our intention is to help Gorbachev
in any way we can.''

   It's easier to be a prosecutor than to act
the part of one, says District Attorney Hal Ware, who is preparing
for a theater role.
   ``In a trial, I can ask questions and go where the answer leads
me,'' Ware said. ``In this, I have to be sure I ask the question
that's going to get the response the witness is supposed to give.''
   Ware is playing the part of prosecutor Augustus W. DeLee in the
1853 trial of a man accused of killing his brother after their
71-year-old father tried to get back property he'd given them seven
years earlier.
   The drama, titled ``In the Arms of Justice,'' was to be
performed three times today in the courtroom where the original
trial was held as part of the annual East Feliciana Pilgrimage
parish festival.
   Clerk of Court Debbie Hudnall went through court records dating
back to 1825 to find a good case to use for a drama. The jury
handed down a verdict in the murder trial, but Sheriff A.T. Law
intervened and the case apparently went unresolved, she said.
   Hudnall won't be appearing on stage, since women didn't have the
right to vote or to hold public office in 1853.

<TEXT>
   With just six weeks left to prepare a
superpower summit, U.S. officials reported a productive meeting
between Secretary of State James A. Baker III and a senior Soviet
arms control negotiator.
   Viktor P. Karpov met with Baker and Undersecretary Reginald
Bartholomew on Friday in an effort to restart momentum toward a new
treaty to reduce long-range nuclear weapons.
   A senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
``it was a very productive ... worthwhile meeting,'' but refused to
provide any details.
   But time is running out before Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev comes to Washington for a five-day summit that begins May
30, other American officials acknowledged.
   Hope has been abandoned that Gorbachev and President Bush might
sign a completed arms treaty at the summit.
   Two weeks ago, after talks between Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze and Baker, U.S. and Soviet officials acknowledged that
even a framework agreement on key issues might not be ready for
Bush and Gorbachev to initial.
   One key stumbling block is U.S. refusal to limit ballistic
missiles with multiple warheads aboard submarines, while insisting
that the Soviets agree to a ban on land-based missiles with
multiple warheads.
   The U.S. Navy is preparing to deploy new D-5 ballistic missiles,
carrying eight warheads each, on submarines. Most Soviet
multiwarhead missiles are concentrated on land.
   Baker and Shevardnadze also could not agree on limiting cruise
missiles carried aboard jet fighters. The Soviets want a lower
ceiling than the United States, which is developing a new missile
within the range the Soviets would put off-limits.
   Baker and Shevardnadze agreed to meet again in the Soviet Union
on May 16-19, probably at a Black Sea resort.
   Karpov's visit here was an unusual move that reflected growing
anxiety on both sides.
   ``They are trying to put it back on track,'' a U.S. official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity, said about the Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty (START).
   ``We have had a crescendo of progress until the last round here,
when little or nothing got done.''
   ``There is a lot of work to be done,'' said Margaret D.
Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman. ``I'm not going to get
into an agenda or a laundry list of the specifics of what they
discussed.''

<HEAD>Alcoa Targets Wealthier Consumers For Recycling</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A top aluminum manufacturer is tugging at
heartstrings, not just pocketbooks, to stimulate recycling among
white-collar beer and soda drinkers by promising to donate profits
from returned cans to charity.
   The Aluminum Company of America is financing the projects to
lure upscale beverage consumers who are unmoved by what amounts to
an 11-cent bounty on a six-pack in states that don't have deposit
laws.
   ``If we can find a cause, we'll motivate them,'' Alcoa spokesman
John Van Devender said.
   Alcoa said most of 1,400 can collectors it recently surveyed
coming into Alcoa redemption centers earn less than $35,000
annually. That means there's a wealthier pool of potential
recyclers for the beverage industry to tap.
   U.S. aluminum makers have said they want to recycle more cans
rather than make new aluminum with their power-thirsty smelters.
The industry hopes to recycle three out of four cans by 1995. The
current rate is three out of five.
   ``There's a large element out there, the upper and middle
classes, that's still not recycling,'' said George Cobb, president
of Alcoa's recycling division. ``There are a lot of costs involved
in collecting cans, in terms of gas mileage and time ... It's hard
to move people.''
   Recycling revenue already has helped pay for restoration of a
battleship near Houston, while a nationwide network of municipal
and volunteer fire companies collects cans and donates the proceeds
to young burn victims.
   Volunteer firefighter Henry Urban of Cherry City, Pa., drove to
an Alcoa recycling center in Pittsburgh on Thursday to drop off two
bags of cans collected by his grandson, Mark.
   Alcoa donates the money to a hospital ``and Mark gets to know
that he's doing some good,'' Urban said.
   The Urbans are not Alcoa's typical customers. The company's
survey said 60 percent of recyclers are motivated by cash alone.
Only 25 percent said they want to reduce waste in the environment.
   ``I do it for the money,'' said John Lucci, after hauling in 36
pounds of cans, some of which overflowed from the covered bed of
his pickup truck. The aluminum booty brought him $13.
   Pennsylvania is one of 41 states without a statewide law
mandating deposits on aluminum cans to encourage recycling. Alcoa
says the states with such laws are California, Iowa, Michigan,
Oregon, Connecticut, New York, Massachusetts, Vermont and Maine.
   Trade figures show beverage makers used 6.5 percent more
aluminum cans in 1989. The recycling rate also grew _ from 54.6
percent of cans reused in 1988 to a record 60.8 percent last year,
according to the Aluminum Association, a trade group.
   The increase marks a recovery from the leaner days of the
mid-1980s aluminum recession. Like other major producers committed
to buy every can collected by scrap aluminum dealers, Alcoa piled
mountains of surplus cans outside recycling centers during the
slowdown.
   ``We knew we'd eventually work (the surplus) off,'' Van Devender
said. ``If we were going to build this giant recycling system, we
knew we'd have to get through the good years and the bad years.''
   The recycling boom last year spawned new can-melting plants in
Sheffield, Ala.; Houser, Idaho; and Berea and Morgantown, Ky. In
contrast, the last new aluminum smelter started production in 1980.
   Producing aluminum through recycling is far less expensive than
smelting new aluminum. The current cost of a smelter similar in
size to the recently opened recycling plant in Berea would cost
$600 million, industry observers say.
   The Berea plant, the largest of its kind with the capabilty of
recycling 120 million tons of cans a year, cost $50 million, said
Stan Lampe, a spokesman for Alcan, the company that owns the plant.
   The aluminum industry uses 1 percent of the electricity
generated in the country, and most of that is consumed by smelters,
according to an Alcoa annual report.
   ``The aluminum industry is, by nature, capital intensive.
Recycling is not,'' Lampe said. ``We see it as one of our major
growth areas.''
   So do Pennsylvania and the dozen other states that have passed
so-called ``curbside collection'' laws. Effective in September,
Pennsylvania's law forces 408 larger communities and townships to
separate and recycle aluminum, as well as glass, steel, paper and
plastics.
   Alcoa's Cobb said the laws could pose a problem for the company
because it must train thousands of municipal garbage workers to
prepare aluminum for shipment. Foreign material in a batch of scrap
aluminum can cause explosions during melting or health problems for
consumers, he said.
   Mildred Wood of Ross Township said efforts like mandatory
recycling and charitable causes are needed. Ms. Wood, who collects
cans from the 18 residents of her apartment building, said the
tenants use recycling checks to buy garden hoses and hardware for
their building.
   ``The time's coming,'' she said, ``when we all should be
recycling.''

<HEAD>Democrats Make Gesture to Republicans on Campaign Finance Reform</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Democrats say they're trying to get a
message to Republicans on campaign finance reform by dropping their
demand for fixed ceilings on how much candidates can spend.
   ``We're trying to send a signal to Republicans. I hope they'll
look upon it as a signal,'' Oklahoma Sen. David Boren said after a
closed-door caucus meeting Friday.
   The Democratic senators also agreed to proposals by Republican
Sen. John Danforth of Missouri for reducing the cost of TV
advertising and discouraging negative campaign tactics.
   The Democratic meeting followed a similar GOP meeting Thursday
on campaign reform. Senators planned to huddle again in party
caucuses next Tuesday.
   ``Before you can have real negotiations, you have to have each
side say, `Here is our starting point,''' Boren said. ``We know
we're not going to enact a law by picking off people on the other
side. Fundamentally, it is going to have to be a bill that is not
passed on party lines.''

   Sen. John Heinz says the 1990 census has
problems that call for immediate congressional attention.
   ``The stakes are too high and the implications too far-ranging
for Congress not to take an active role in responding to the
problems,'' the Pennsylvania Republican said Friday.
   Just a day earlier, a group of House members took the Census
Bureau to task.
   Mail-back response to the census has been slower than expected
and problems were experienced in getting forms delivered to 4.8
million people in several areas.
   This is being corrected, Census Director Barbara Everitt Bryant
told a House census subcommittee meeting on Thursday.
   She said the accuracy of the count is not in danger. But she
estimated it will cost at least $100 million more than originally
planned to count people who haven't responded by mail.
   Heinz's call for a hearing on Census problems came in a letter
to Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, head of the Governmental Affairs
Committee.

<HEAD>Forestry Section Included in Senate Farm Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Responding to concerns about global warming,
the Senate Agriculture Committee has included a forestry section in
a farm bill for the first time.
   Sen. Wyche Fowler, D-Ga., said the step was taken Friday ``in
light of the numerous issues that have developed pertaining to
forestry _ global warming, timber production, threatened and
endangered species, air and water quality.''
   Fowler is chairman of the subcommittee on conservation and
forests and comes from a state where small, privately held forest
acreage generates about $9 billion and provides 80,000 jobs.
   ``Including forestry in the farm bill underscores an important
fact,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the agriculture
committee. ``The total value of our timber harvests exceeds that of
any crop, including corn, soybeans, wheat and hay.''

<HEAD>Six Charged With Trying to Sell U.S. Hardware Left in Vietnam</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six men are charged with operating as brokers for
the Vietnamese government to sell U.S. military hardware abandoned
at the end of the Vietnam War to parties in the United States.
   A five-month U.S. Customs Service probe resulted in indictments
unsealed Friday against the men and three firms they represent.
They are charged with violations of the Trading with the Enemy Act,
which limits travel and commerce with a handful of nations, Vietnam
among them.
   The defendants were seeking buyers for parts from 150 C-130
transport planes and an undetermined number of A-37 Sky Raiders,
and U.S.-made M-16 and Soviet-made AK-47 rifles _ as well as more
than 4 million metric tons of rice, Custom officials said.
   ``These commodities have been sitting over there since 1975, and
we are aware that they are occasionally offered for sale in whole
or in airplane parts,'' said Charles S. Harrison, assistant special
agent in charge for the Houston Customs Service office.
   Millions of dollars worth of U.S. weapons and other hardware
were seized by Communist forces when they overran South Vietnam in
1975, and the Vietnamese government has given away or sold some of
the materiel. Vietnam-era assault rifles have been recovered from
leftist guerrillas in El Salvador, for example.
   Robert C. DeBrophy, 61, Khanh Cong Tang, 41, Bao Tran, 57, and
Guy Willard Tooker, 63, were arrested Friday. Roy John Scott, 63,
and Binh Vinh Tran remained at large.
   The firms named in the indictment were Royal Colombia and its
predecessor, Middle East American Co. Inc., and Nualart Imex Corp.
   U.S. Magistrate Frances H. Stacy scheduled an arraignment
hearing for Thursday. Bond was set at $20,000 each, and all but
DeBrophy were required to post $2,000 cash.
   Tang and the two Trans are naturalized U.S. citizens from
Vietnam.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Mike Clark refused to comment other than
to characterize the charges as serious. If convicted, each
defendant faces a maximum of 15 years in prison and $500,000 in
fines.
   ``All six were acting on behalf of the government of Vietnam in
this conspiracy,'' a Customs statement said.
   A fax message that Bao Tran sent Feb. 1 from Vietnam to an
undercover agent the brokers were in touch with said all
transactions were being negotiated directly with the Aviation
Department of the Vietnamese government, according to the
indictment.
   It alleged that Bao Tran was a go-between with Vietnamese
government officials, Tang and Binh Vinh Tran courted prospective
buyers, Tooker financed the operations and DeBrophy and Scott
arranged transshipment of the rice through Canada.
   None of the equipment or food ever reached the United States.
   State Department restrictions also affect travel and commerce
with Cambodia, Cuba, Lebanon, Libya and North Korea.

<HEAD>Bear Chases Brothers, Father Shoots Bear, Alaskans Complain</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The enraged bear that chased two
brothers down a hill after they poked around its den was brought
down by their father, but many Alaskans apparently think the
brothers nearly got what was coming to them.
   The newspaper report Friday that provided harrowing details of
the encounter between the bear and Brian and Doug Dixon caught the
attention of state wildlife protection agents, who said they
received dozens of calls requesting state action.
   Some of the callers were hunting opponents, but others were
hunters concerned that the bear apparently had been disturbed in
its den, in violation of hunting etiquette, said Fish and Game
spokesman Bruce Bartley.
   According to reports, the Dixons were hunting a week ago, 125
miles northwest of Anchorage in the Alaska Range, when Brian, 19,
and Doug, 22, approached a bear den unarmed, with their father Jim
Dixon on a snowmachine about 125 yards away.
   While they were examining the entrance of the den, the bear
bolted out and chased the men down the mountain. Jim Dixon fired
four shots before felling the bear, as his sons tumbled and ran
down the mountain screaming for help.
   Peggy Dixon, wife and mother of the hunters, says the family
welcomed an investigation.
   ``They're legal 100 percent,'' she said. ``Jim and both boys had
hunting licenses, they had bear tags, and they're residents. They
were on a legitimate hunt.''
   The Dixon story was the topic of local radio call-in shows.
Peggy Dixon says she did not listen, but a friend told her the
comments were ``mostly negative.''
   ``Let's get real,'' she said Friday night. ``We're talking about
boys, a 19-year-old and 22-year-old, who've been hunting all their
lives and just have some normal curiosity.
   ``That's why they walked up to it. All the tracks were leading
away, there were no tracks going into the den.''
   Jim Dixon was away on a hunting trip and was not expected back
until Sunday night.
   According to a Fish and Wildlife officer, there is nothing in
state law to prevent anyone defending life or property from killing
an animal. But there are conditions: For instance, necessity may
not be brought about by harassment or provocation, or by an
unreasonable investigation of an animal's habitat.
   Killing wildlife under these violations is punishable by a year
in jail, a $1000 fine, or both.
   One Fish and Wildlife officer, who spoke on condition he not be
named, said that it appeared as if the bear kill was within the law.
   Longtime bear guide Kevin FitzGerald, of Talkeetna, said he
found the story appalling.
   ``There's no law against hunting a bear in its den,'' FitzGerald
said. ``Legally, they'll probably get off if they had tags. But
it's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.''

<HEAD>American Nations Plan To Speed Up Drug War</HEAD>

<DATELINE>IXTAPA, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States has joined 31 other
American states in agreeing to step up the war on drugs with
heavier penalties and improved international cooperation.
   Despite Friday's accord, the United States and Mexico remained
at odds over the reported abduction of a Mexican doctor to face
U.S. charges in the killing of a drug agent.
   Mexico has threatened to stop cooperating with the United States
in anti-drug efforts if more suspects are kidnapped on its
territory.
   The 20-point anti-drug plan, dubbed the Declaration of Ixtapa,
was signed by the United States, Mexico and 30 other members of the
Organization of American States, or OAS.
   It calls for better education and prevention starting in grammar
school, greater coordination in police work, improvements in
information exchanges and tougher legislation.
   It also calls for stronger measures against money laundering and
the illegal sale of weapons and explosives. It recommends stricter
controls on lab equipment and chemicals for making drugs.
   The declaration includes economic aid through international
financial institutions, led by the Inter American Development Bank.
The program would help farmers substitute legal crops for
high-paying illicit ones like coca leaf, poppies and marijuana. No
figures were given for funding.
   Latin America is a leading grower and producer of cocaine,
heroin and marijuana. The United States is the world's leading
consumer and center for money laundering.
   Experts from the OAS nations unanimously concluded in a report
to justice ministers at the four-day meeting that nowhere is the
drug problem more serious and pressing than in this hemisphere.
   The declaration also called for greater cooperation by
governments ``for adequate control of their borders,'' with
``absolute respect for the sovereingty and territorial integrity of
states.''
   However, the accord made no mention of extraditing suspects from
one country to another, especially to the United States.
   Extradition has been a touchy issue in Latin America in recent
years, exacerbated recently by the alleged abduction of the suspect
from Mexico.
   The Mexican government has demanded an explanation for what an
embassy spokesman in Washington called the ``illegal detention'' of
Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain.
   According to news reports, bounty hunters seized the
gynecologist at his Guadalajara office on April 2 for a large
reward offered by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.
   Alvarez Machain was brought to El Paso, Texas, the next day and
arrested.
   The doctor is one of 19 Mexicans indicted by a federal grand
jury in Los Angeles on charges in the 1985 torture-slaying of DEA
agent Enrique ``Kiki'' Camarena. He is accused of drugging Camarena
while the agent was tortured by his killers.
   U.S. Attorney General Richard Thornburgh issued a statement
Friday saying, ``Although the Drug Enforcement Administration has
not completed its investigation of the circumstances surrounding
the apprehension of Dr. Machain, it has been confirmed that no DEA
personnel were present when he was taken into custody in Mexico or
when he was boarded onto an aircraft in that country.''
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said he ``did not
foresee any circumstances'' under which Alvarez Machain would be
returned to Mexico instead of facing trial in Los Angeles.
   An official at Mexico's Foreign Ministry, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said it was ``arrogantly absurd'' to make such a
statement.
   Mexico's attorney general, in a meeting Wednesday with
Thornburgh, threatened to withhold Mexican cooperation in drug
matters if it were determined the doctor was kidnapped at the DEA's
behest.

   Jerome Butler, who ordered his lawyers
to stop their appeals and told fellow inmates he would wait for
them in hell, was executed early today for the 1986 murder of a
taxi driver.
   Butler appeared relaxed as witnesses filed into the death
chamber. ``I just want to say I wish everybody a good life and
things like that,'' he said. ``Everything is OK.''
   Then he nodded to the prison warden and a chaplain standing
nearby, coughed several times and stopped breathing. He was
pronounced dead at 12:26 a.m. CDT, 11 minutes after a lethal
injection was administered.
   ``This is what I've been waiting for _ for this moment _ to know
this man cannot take away another wife's husband and children's
father,'' Robbie Oakley, the widow of slain cab driver Nathan
Oakley of Houston, said Friday.
   ``We feel pretty badly about this,'' Vic Pecorino, one of
Butler's attorneys, said before the execution. ``Jerome Butler is
not your typical mad-dog killer.
   ``Without cooperation from him, what are you going to appeal?''
   An inmate whose cell is near Butler's on the Texas Death Row
said Butler had been prepared to die for weeks.
   ``He said he doesn't want to be among the walking dead,'' said
Raymond Carl Kinnamon. ``He's happy as a lark on Easter Sunday. But
he's definitely said he's going to hell. He said, `I'll wait for
you in hell.'''
   Attorney General Jim Mattox, who witnessed the execution, said
prison officials offered Butler, 54, a last chance to seek a stay.
   ``He .. indicated he wanted to go on forward,'' Mattox said.
``He had indicated he simply did not want to live in prison and get
out a very old man if he would not be executed.''
   Prosecutors said Butler may have shot to death Oakley, 67, in
June 1986, because the driver recognized Butler as the man who
killed his friend, A.C. Johnson, in 1973. Butler served 10 years of
a 30-year prison term for that slaying.
   Altogether, he spent 27 years behind bars, beginning with 13
years at Sing Sing Prison in New York beginning in 1959 for
robbery, attempted sexual assault and accessory to rape.
   
   The year after his release he was arrested for the Johnson
slaying and sentenced to 30 years. He got out of prison in 1984.
Two years later, he was on death row.
   Butler had passed competency tests, so appeals on psychological
grounds could not be raised.
   ``I just want to get it over with,'' he said last month when his
execution date was set.
   He told attorneys that even if he won a new trial and received a
life sentence, he would be well into his 70's before he would
become eligible for parole.
   ``What am I supposed to do then? Go live under a bridge?'' he
asked.
   Butler became the 34th inmate, and the oldest, to be executed in
Texas since the state resumed capital punishment in 1982. The total
is the highest of any state.
   He was the 122nd inmate executed in the United States since the
Supreme Court in 1976 allowed states to resume the death penalty.

   National lawmakers have approved a
change in the country's official name to satisfy Slovak demands for
greater recognition.
   The new name, the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic, was
approved Friday in a vote by both houses of Parliament, but only
after an inconclusive first ballot.
   The vote in the House of the People was 133-20 with eight
abstentions. In the House of Nations, 102 of the 149 deputies
supported the new name. The number of opposing votes and
abstentions in that tally was not available.
   The legislation needed a two-thirds majority in both chambers.
Legislator Vaclav Benda said the necessary majority was not
achieved in a first round of balloting, and a second vote was taken
after a recess.
   The name change took effect immediately. It was the second in
less than a month.
   Parliament renamed the country the Czechoslovak Federative
Republic on March 23, replacing the word ``Socialist'' with
``Federative'' to symbolize the country's shedding of its Communist
past.
   Parliament then permitted the Slovaks to refer to the country as
the Czecho-Slovak Federative Republic to underline the separate
identities of the two republics that make up the nation.
   But Slovaks, who account for a third of Czechoslovakia's 15.5
million people, demanded their identity be specified more clearly
in the new name.
   Thousands of Slovaks demonstrated in March in Bratislava, the
Slovak capital, protesting over the country's name and demanding an
independent Slovak state.
   In a new rally for independence, more than 2,000 people gathered
late Friday in Bratislava. The peaceful protest was organized by
the Movement of the National Council for the Liberation of
Slovakia, which wants a referendum on the issue by the end of this
year.

<HEAD>Merck to Offer Drug Discounts to Medicaid Patients</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DWIGHT OESTRICHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RAHWAY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world's largest drug company says it
will start offering discount drugs to Medicaid patients, a move
long opposed by the pharmaceutical industry.
   Merck &amp; Co. announced its plan as Congress and Medicaid
officials in several states sought to force drug price reductions.
   But Merck will offer the seven to 12 percent savings only in
states that drop restrictions barring Medicaid reimbursement to
doctors who prescribe the company's most expensive drugs, said Tony
Fiskett, spokesman for Merck Sharpe &amp; Dohne, the Rahway company's
West Point, Penn.-based pharmaceutical division.
   About 24 states now restrict which drugs qualify for Medicaid,
often allowing reimbursement only for lower-cost generic drugs.
   Ronald Nordmann, an analyst at Paine Webber Securities, said the
plan announced Thursday is ``a very clever program'' that ``would
bring increases in purchases of Merck products.''
   Fiskett said the lower prices will fall between the drug's price
to wholesalers and its cost to large volume buyers, including
federal agencies like the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs,
which already receive significant discounts.
   ``The purpose of the plan is to preserve the ability of doctors
to use those medicines that they choose for their patients and to
ensure Medicaid patients can receive the same cost-effective
medicine available to the general public,'' Fiskett said.
   Currently, about 24 states, including New York, California, and
Massachusetts, limit which drugs qualify for Medicaid payments.
   Merck claims these restrictions unfairly prevent doctors from
prescribing some of its most expensive drugs to Medicaid patients.
   Fiskett said Merck has been planning to put a cost-reducing
program into effect for years but many circumstances, including the
rising cost of Medicaid, finally prompted the company to act this
year.
   ``We are trying to be responsive to the needs of physicians,
patients and the states,'' Fiskett said. ``There was no particular
sticking point, it's just that over time we decided that this is
the responsible thing to do and the fair thing to do.''
   Merck predicts the savings will be millions per year per state,
Fiskett said. He said the price reductions should take effect by
July 1, after all the states have had time to review the plan and
make a decision.
   Merck makes Vasotec for reducing blood pressure; Mevacor for
lowering cholesterol; and Pepcid, which treats ulcers.
   Medicaid purchases amount to about $300 million of Merck's $3
billion in annual American pharmaceutivcal sales, said Dr. John L.
Zabriskie, president of Merck Sharpe &amp; Dohne.

   Rain drenched much of the Northeast, the Midwest and parts of

   Police and organizers of a rally by Haitians and
African Americans to protest AIDS policies had expected 10,000
people, but an extra 40,000 flooded Lower Manhattan and coaxed
Mayor David Dinkins out as well.
   ``The FDA is wrong,'' he shouted, attracting a scream of delight
from the crowd. ``I predict they're going to reverse themselves.''
   The march Friday was in protest of a Food and Drug
Administration policy prohibiting anyone who has emigrated from
Haiti or certain African countries from giving blood, as a
precaution against spreading AIDS.
   Later, Dinkins' prediction came true as a federal AIDS advisory
committee in Washington recommended that the government's ban on
blood donations be eased for people who have been screened for the
deadly virus.
   The recommendation, supported by three of the panel's five
members, will be considered immediately by the Food and Drug
Administration, said Dr. Paul Parkman, the agency's AIDS
coordinator.
   Dr. Joel L. Solomon, director of the FDA's Division of Blood and
Blood products, said in a statement that the emigres have been
excluded from giving blood because the AIDS-related virus is
endemic and is transmitted largely through heterosexual activity in
their countries, making it difficult to tell in advance who would
and would not have the virus.
   Before noon Friday, the crowd swelled quickly as protesters
gathered in downtown Brooklyn and crossed the Brooklyn Bridge,
which was closed for more than two hours.
   Lt. Raymond O'Donnell, a police spokesman, said the police
estimate was 20,000 people at 12:30 p.m. and more than 50,000 an
hour later at the scheduled start of a rally at Federal Plaza.
   ``This is unbelievable,'' he said.
   Two serious injuries were reported when a motorist caught in the
huge crowd got into an argument with some of the demonstrators,
said another police spokesman, Sgt. Ed Burns.
   There were no arrests.
   A press notice announcing the demonstration stated it was
sponsored by a coalition of students, community groups and clergy
organizations called the Haitian Enforcement Against Racism.
   Several people carried a large black coffin through the crowd.
Printed on it was ``AIDS is a U.S. government germ warfare.''
   Another sign read, ``Scientists Created AIDS to Kill Black
Population.''
   About 1.6 percent of all AIDS cases in the United States are
among Haitians. Many of the Haitian immigrants live in Florida and
New York.

<TEXT>
   The foster mother of an AIDS-infected 5-year-old
boy said she bore no grudge against a church that barred the child
from Sunday school classes but lifted the ban after it drew
criticism.
   Terry and Walt Rucker said late Friday they ``welcome the
opportunity'' to take their son back to Moody Church.
   ``I think more than anything, I felt disappointment when all
this happened,'' Mrs. Rucker said in a telephone interview. ``I
don't feel any bitterness.''
   Earlier Mrs. Rucker had said, ``This is a Bible-teaching church,
and they cannot justify their fears.''
   News of the non-denominational evangelical church's original
decision broke late Thursday, less than two weeks after the April 8
death of Ryan White, an Indiana teen-ager who fought to end
discrimination against AIDS victims.
   The ban sparked criticism from the American Civil Liberties
Union, the Ruckers and AIDS activists, four of whom protested
outside the church Friday.
   At a news conference Friday afternoon, the Rev. Erwin Lutzer _
the church's senior pastor _ announced the ban was lifted.
   Referring to the child by a fictitious name, Lutzer said, ``We
love Joey, and we want Joey back in our Sunday school, and Joey
will be back in our Sunday school.''
   Lutzer said other children's parents would be told a child with
AIDS would be attending Sunday school, ``and they will have the
freedom to keep their children'' from the class.
   ``Our position and our concerns have not changed,'' Lutzer said.
``We have decided to shift the burden of responsibility from us as
a church'' to the parents.
   Rucker said the church's original ban had surprised him, adding,
``We thought with Ryan White, all that had been settled.''
   Lutzer said the original ban was intended only ``to give us time
to think (the situation) through.''
   He said he didn't expect a mass exodus from the class of about
15 children and said the church already welcomes AIDS victims to
its sanctuary services.
   John Hammell, director of the AIDS and Civil Liberties Project
of the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois, said the
decision to bar the boy seemed to violate laws prohibiting
discrimination against the handicapped.
   Rucker, a psychologist, and his wife, a nurse, took Joey in when
his mother, who also had AIDS, became too sick to care for him.
   AIDS is caused by a virus transmitted mainly through sexual
intercourse, shared hypodermic needles and from infected mothers to
their infants before or during birth. It has no known cure.

<TEXT>
   An advance crew began work in two
environmentally sensitive areas in Prince William Sound, 10 days
before Exxon Corp. was to resume its general cleanup of the Exxon
Valdez oil spill.
   The work is aimed at enhancing conditions for commercial fishing
and providing protection for wildlife spring migration into the
sound, the company said.
   A ship left Seward on Friday to work on areas that may need
attention before the general cleanup resumes May 1 because they may
be closed later due to wildlife activity, Exxon spokesman Joe
Tucker in Anchorage said.
   Workers today were spreading absorbent booms in the waters off
Knight and Latouche islands, which include sea bird rookeries and
areas where seals and sea lions haul out.
   As other sites needing cleanup are identified by company and
federal officials, ``they will initially do manual pickup of oily
debris,'' Tucker said.
   The ship carried nine contract employees, an Exxon supervisor,
two boom deployment specialists and observers from the U.S. Coast
Guard and the state Department of Environmental Conservation,
Tucker said.
   ``The crews won't necessarily hit the beaches,'' he said. ``This
is not the start of the main summer cleanup. This is just an
advance squad.''
   Hundreds of miles of shoreline in Prince William Sound were
fouled when the tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground on a charted reef
on March 24, 1989. The reef shredded the tanker's hull, releasing
nearly 11 million gallons of North Slope crude oil into the water.
   It was the nation's biggest oil spill, killing hundreds of
otters and thousands of birds and other animals.
   Exxon said it spent more than $2 billion in last summer's
cleanup campaign, hiring over 10,000 workers and leasing more than
1,000 boats for the operation.
   The oil giant said winter storms scoured clean many of the
beaches, and it plans a greatly reduced operation this year.

<HEAD>Columbia Crew Ready to Fly Astronomy Mission Once Discovery Gets
Off Ground</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA TOLLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Columbia astronauts are waiting
in the shadow of next week's Discovery flight before they are given
the go-ahead to fly into space with their astronomy laboratory.
   While the seven Columbia astronauts have been preparing for
their nine-day flight to observe ultraviolet rays and X-rays in
deep space, the spotlight has been on Discovery's mission to deploy
the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope. That mission was delayed
by two weeks but liftoff is scheduled for Tuesday morning.
   ``We joke around that if they don't get out of the way, we'll
run over them,'' said Columbia Commander Vance Brand, whose mission
is scheduled for a May 9 blastoff.
   Discovery is poised on one launch pad at Cape Canaveral, Fla.,
and Columbia was scheduled Sunday to be rolled out to another pad
1.6 miles away.
   Two shuttles have not been on separate pads simultaneously since
January 1986, when Challenger was moved to the pad while Columbia
was awaiting launch. Challenger exploded 10 days after Columbia
landed.
   While the Columbia astronauts gave their pre-flight press
conference Friday at Houston's Johnson Space Center, technicians at
Cape Canaveral were installing Hubble's powerful batteries in
preparation for launch.
   The batteries will power the telescope from the time it is
disconnected from Discovery's power system until its
energy-collecting solar panels are unfurled in space.
   Hubble, once in orbit 380 miles above Earth, will be capable of
detecting objects 50 times fainter and with 10 times greater
clarity than the best ground-based observatory.
   The Columbia crew will carry the $100 million Astro observatory
into space to observe and measure ultraviolet radiation from
objects in space without interference from the Earth's atmosphere.
The four astronomers on the crew hope the three ultraviolet
instruments and the board band X-ray will shed light on galaxies,
black holes and quasars.
   ``We think this has tremendous science potential,'' Brand said.
   On Friday, the Columbia astronauts noted that their observatory
should be able to relay information to the ground first, even
though Hubble will get to space sooner.
   ``We will be sending down science data while space telescope is
still doing engineering checkout, and so we should be able to beat
them to the punch on getting down the first science data,'' said
mission specialist Robert Parker.
   For the first time since the Challenger accident, two payload
specialists will fly into space aboard Columbia. Ronald Parise and
Samuel Durrance will be operating the telescopes along with mission
specialists Jeffrey Hoffman and Parker. The observatory will be in
the shuttle's cargo bay but will be operated by the astronauts in
the shuttle cabin.
   Parise is a senior scientist in the space observatories
department at the Computer Sciences Corp. in Silver Spring, Md.
Durrance is a research scientist in the physics and astronomy
department at John Hopkins University.
   Pilot Guy Gardner and flight engineer John M. ``Mike'' Lounge
will be in charge of maneuvering the orbiter so the telescopes can
be aimed at different points in space.
   Even though the Hubble mission has been getting most of the
media attention, Hoffman said the two flights are not in
competition. He said he teases the Discovery crew members, saying
he'll get the chance to work as a space astronomer for more than a
week.
   ``All they do is throw out a telescope. Anybody can do that,''
Hoffman joked.

<TEXT>
   A woman whose 2-year-old son was dunked
head-first into a toilet repeatedly as punishment for soiling his
pants pleaded guilty to her part in the boy's death and was
sentenced to 30 years in prison.
   Sheryl McGee Coe, 21, was sentenced Friday for second-degree
murder and aggravated child abuse in the July 27 death of Bradley
McGee.
   Outrage over the toddler's death prompted lawmakers last fall to
pass the ``Bradley McGee Bill,'' allocating an extra $78 million
for the state to hire more child-protection workers.
   Mrs. Coe and her husband, Thomas Coe, 22, originally were
charged with first-degree murder.
   Coe told authorities he repeatedly dunked Bradley head-first
into a toilet for soiling his pants, then he and his wife beat him
with pillows until he collapsed.
   Prosecutors said Mrs. Coe will be subpoenaed to testify against
her husband at his first-degree murder and aggravated child abuse
trial, set for July.
   Corrections officials said that with good behavior, Mrs. Coes
would serve 10 years in prison.
   The boy had been put in foster care when he was 3 months old
after his parents abandoned him at a mall. Two months before his
death, the state Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services
returned the child to his parents, despite repeated warnings from
foster parents and relatives that he might be in danger.
   Three state child protection workers were charged with failing
to report suspected child abuse in the case. One supervisor was
acquitted in February and the others face trial.

   Fire ripped through the upper floor of a
five-story hotel before dawn today, sending 150 sleepy guests
scurrying to safety near the glittering Las Vegas Strip,
authorities said.
   Three people were treated for minor smoke inhalation in the fire
at the Las Vegas Inn, but no serious injuries were reported and no
one was believed trapped in the hotel, officials said.
   Early warnings allowed nearly all 150 guests in the 75-room
hotel to evacuate the hotel without injury, city spokesman Doug
Bradford said.
   ``We believe the fire started in the attic,'' Bradford said.
``We were able to keep the fire on the roof and top floor.'' The
fire broke out about 2:30 a.m. and was brought under control nearly
three hours later.
   The building was equipped with sprinklers in accordance with a
state law enacted following the MGM Grand Hotel fire that killed 87
in November 1980, Bradford said. He added that the sprinklers
``definitely saved lives and probably saved the entire building.''
   Tina Gutierrez, 26, of Los Angeles was asleep on the fourth
floor when warnings first sounded.
   ``I woke up to find the fire alarm going off,'' she said. ``It
went off, thank goodness. I opened the door and there was black
smoke.''
   Two smoke victims were treated and released from Valley
Hospital, said nursing supervisor Eleanor Jakobs. A third was
treated and released from University Medical Center, according to a
nursing supervisor who said hospital policy prevented him from
giving his name.
   Bradford said a couple of other people were treated at the scene
for minor cuts or smoke problems.
   The cause of the fire was not immediately determined.
   Scores of onlookers lined the street as firefighters rained
water on the blaze.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper that often reflects the views
of Iran's president today urged pro-Iranian hostage-takers in
Lebanon to hasten talks to free an American captive.
   The Tehran Times said it hoped the release of one captive could
be ``the prelude to the release of one more hostage by another
group.''
   The editorial was the latest in a series of hostage developments
that began Wednesday, when one Lebanese group holding three
American educators said it would release one hostage by Friday.
   However, the Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine said
Thursday it had indefinitely postponed the release. It blamed the
delay on the refusal of the United States to send a senior diplomat
to Damascus, as the group demanded.
   A Shiite Moslem cleric reputed to have influence over the
kidnappers, Hussain Musawi, said Friday by telephone from his
headquarters in the eastern Lebanese town of Baalbek that freedom
for a hostage was certain despite the delays.
   Asked when he expected the release to take place, Musawi said:
``That depends on how far-sighted the Americans might become. So
far, their behavior is arrogant and one of cowboy mentality.''
   Musawi heads Islamic Amal, a faction within the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah group that advocates strong links with Syria.
   Hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella for Shiite Moslem
groups holding most of the 18 Western hostages in Lebanon.
   Thousands of Hezbollah members joined a military parade Friday
through Beirut's southern slums, two blocks from where many of the
hostages are believed held.
   Syria has said it is working to free one by Sunday.
   In Damascus, officials have met frequently with U.S. Ambassador
Edward Djerejian since he returned to the Syrian capital Thursday.
   The Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine had demanded
the United States send John Kelly, the assistant secretary of state
for Near Eastern affairs, to Damascus for final coordination of the
release. He was the ambassador to Lebanon from 1986 to 1988, and he
conducted secret hostage negotiations in what became known as the
Iran-Contra affair.
   In Washington, Kelly said Djerejian was in Damascus and ``fully
capable of handling all the details of bringing a hostage out
safely, and quickly, and efficiently.''
   ``You know American policy is that we do not make concessions to
those who hold the hostages,'' Kelly said in a statement. ``We want
the hostages out, but we are not going to bow to the demands of the
hostage-holders.''
   The English-language Tehran Times said the kidnappers should
consider Djerejian's presence ``good enough to conduct the
arrangements for the release of the hostage.''
   It repeated an appeal, first made in February, for ``freedom of
all hostages without any conditions and immediately.''
   ``Hurdles there may be on the way, but it is our hope that
despite all, the freedom of the hostages can become a reality
materializing soon,'' said the newspaper, considered close to
Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani.
   The Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine holds Alann
Steen, a native of Boston who turns 51 on Sunday; Jesse Turner, 42,
of Boise, Idaho; and Robert Polhill, 55, of New York.
   It had not said which of the three it had considered freeing.
   They were kidnapped from the campus of the U.S.-affiliated
Beirut University College on Jan. 24, 1987, by gunmen disguised as
riot police.
   Eight Americans are among the 18 Westerners held in Lebanon. The
longest-held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for
The Associated Press. He was kidnapped in Beirut on March 16, 1985.
   West German hostage Heinrich Struebig turned 49 in captivity
today.
   Struebig, a relief worker with the German organization
Asme-Humanitas, was kidnapped May 16, 1989, near the south Lebanon
city of Sidon along with a German colleague, 28-year-old Thomas
Kemptner. No group has claimed responsibility for their abduction.
   Relatives of two hostages said Friday in Damascus they were
optimistic.
   ``The mood seems to be as if the hostage issue, the hostage
file, will be finally closed,'' said Feryal Polhill, the wife of
Robert Polhill.
   ``I would like President Bush not to spare any effort to free
all the hostages,'' added Mrs. Polhill, who is Lebanese.
   Hala El-Khazen, sister-in-law of Jesse Turner, said she brought
a suitcase full of his clothes with her to Damascus.

<TEXT>
   Lithuania shut most of its factories
today to save fuel and raw materials in the face of an expanding
embargo by Moscow to break the independence drive, a top government
official said.
   Leaders of the republic, which declared independence March 11,
said they were still searching for a compromise to end the standoff
but that no firm proposals were under discussion.
   On Friday, the Kremlin tightened its vise on Lithuania by
expanding its energy embargo to other products, and Soviet troops
stormed a printing plant and beat at least 13 people, Lithuanians
said.
   Today is a regular workday under normal circumstances, but
Deputy Premier Romualdas Ozolas said the majority of factories were
shut.
   ``We decided not to waste our strength while it is not
necessary,'' Ozolas said in an interview.
   Since Wednesday, Moscow has cut off all oil and about 80 percent
of the natural gas supply to Lithuania. Officials said Friday that
supplies of some food products, tires, cable and other goods also
were curtailed.
   Traffic on the streets of Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, was
greatly reduced today. A rationing plan limits drivers to about 7
gallons of gasoline a month.
   Ozolas said some Lithuanian factories probably would have to
close starting Monday because of shortages of fuel and raw
materials. However, he said the neighboring Baltic republic of
Estonia was offering aid, and an agreement probably would be
reached late today.
   President Vytautus Landsbergis, speaking to reporters at the
opening of a meeting by the pro-independence Sajudis movement, said
Lithuania was searching for a compromise with Moscow, but there
were no proposals on the table.
   Asked about reports that Moscow was offering to negotiate if
Lithuania delayed independence for two years, he said: ``We haven't
received any kind of proposal.''
   ``We haven't debated this,'' he said. But he also said some
compromise ideas had been raised in contacts through middlemen. He
would not give details.
   Landsbergis was quoted as saying Friday that a two-year
moratorium on full independence could form part of a compromise.
   ``If somebody authorized by Moscow to negotiate presented us
with a package of proposals including this, we could have a
discussion,'' The New York Times quoted him as saying in today's
editions.
   However, he also reportedly said Lithuania would not agree to
put itself under the authority of the Soviet constitution.
   Ozolas, Landsbergis and Estonian Premier Edgar Savisaar
conferred informally Saturday morning during a break in the Sajudis
session.
   Savisaar, recalling that Lithuanian civilians were beaten by
Soviet soldiers who occupied a Vilnius printing plant Friday, told
the congress: ``What happened in Vilnius yesterday could happen in
Tallin tomorrow. Estonians understand this and are ready to share
the hardships.''
   The Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia were
forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940. Despite the Soviet
military and economic pressure, Lithuania has refused to back off
its declaration of independence and has sought Western material and
political support.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has refused to negotiate unless
Lithuania rescinds the declaration.
   In Birmingham, Ala., where President Bush addressed a political
rally, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the White House is
``increasingly concerned'' by reports of the economic crackdown on
Lithuania and that Bush will brief Congress early next week on
possible retaliation.
   Lithuanians produce more meat and milk than they consume, and
they are in no danger of serious food shortages.
   However, Lithuania's Communist Party chief, Algirdas Brazauskas,
said the republic's 3.8 million people must compromise on its
pro-independence decisions or face critical shortages of oil and
natural gas in two weeks.
   ``In two weeks, we will have a critical situation,'' Brazauskas
told the Lithuanian parliament. ``The price for independence must
have limits.''
   Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene today traveled to
Copenhagen for talks with Danish officials. She was in Norway on
Friday discussing how to obtain oil at world-market prices instead
of low-cost oil for Soviet rubles. She offered to trade Lithuanian
dairy products.
   Armed soldiers stormed a Communist Party printing plant in
Vilnius during the afternoon and beat at least 13 people, witnesses
said.
   There has been almost no violence during the standoff with
Moscow, even though Soviet soldiers have previously occupied
several party and public buildings. Soviet forces have also dragged
some deserters back to the military.
   Lithuanian legislator Zigmas Vaisvilas said civilian guards
arrived Friday at the plant, which already was occupied by a few
Interior Ministry troops without weapons.
   The Soviet news agency Tass said the colonel in charge asked the
civilians to leave and called in reinforcements when they refused.
   Helmeted Soviet soldiers carrying automatic weapons and
truncheons arrived in two trucks, entered the building and beat
some of the civilians, said witness Angele Guobiene, who works for
the trade union journal Darbas Ir Poilsis, which is printed at the
plant.
   Soviet authorities let about two dozen foreign correspondents
return to Lithuania until Sunday after expelling virtually all of
them from the republic on April 1.

   Hundreds of right-wing and left-wing
extremists went on the rampage after a soccer game and at least 48
people were injured, authorities said today.
   Soccer fans and neo-Nazis were dispersed in East Berlin before a
leftist group arrived from West Berlin to confront them. But the
leftists themselves went on a rampage in West Berlin, looting
stores and hurling rocks.
   Fifty-seven people were arrested, officials said.
   Trouble started after a soccer match between FC Berlin and Hansa
Rostock Friday in the eastern part of the divided city, where 300
youths, some wearing masks, fought pitched battles in Alexander
Platz, East Berlin's main square.
   Some rioters shouted tributes to Adolf Hitler's 101st birthday
Friday and attacked passersby, police said.
   The official East German news agency ADN said the mob also
stormed a homosexual bar screaming ``Gay's out.'' Amid cries of
``You know it's Adolf Hitler's birthday,'' they smashed windows and
ransacked the club.
   Witnesses said some of the club's 15 guests suffered minor cuts
and bruises in the fray, ADN said. They were not, however, included
among the injured.
   An East German Interior Ministry statement said two people were
seriously hurt and four police sustained light injuries in the
Alexander Platz fracas. An official of the FC Berlin soccer club
was also badly hurt after being attacked.
   The ministry said 30 youths were arrested.
   Police said about 300 West Berlin leftists and foreign residents
gathered on the western side of the Wall after hearing radio
reports of the violence, then moved into East Berlin to confront
the thugs.
   Police said the group returned to West Berlin within an hour
after discovering the opposing group had already been dispersed.
   ``As they did not meet any right-wing extremists, they came back
to vent their fury here,'' said West Berlin police spokesman Heinz
Wiedemann.
   The leftists hurled stones and bottles at police, built street
barricades and smashed shop and car windows. He said at least three
stores were looted in West Berlin's Kreuzberg district, he said.
   Wiedemann said 41 policemen were injured and 27 people were
arrested in the West Berlin clashes.
   Berlin defeated Hansa Rostock 3-0 in the soccer match.

<HEAD>Japan Running Out of Room For Its Garbage</HEAD>

   Japan will soon run out of room to stash its trash,
the government said Saturday.
   ``The problem is a disease of extravagance,'' said Tetsuo
Hayakawa, spokesman for the Health and Welfare Ministry's
environmental affairs division. ``People are throwing away
everything, even things still good enough to use.''
   The mountainous island nation, comparable in size to California,
created 48.3 million tons of trash in 1988, 3.9 percent more than
the year before, the Health and Welfare Ministry said. It rushed to
compile the data months ahead of schedule in time for international
Earth Day Sunday.
   The volume of trash produced by the nation's industries and 120
million people was enough to fill Japan's largest stadium, the
Tokyo Dome, 130 times over, the ministry said.
   Hayakawa said that if the Japanese continue wasting resources at
the current pace, they will create more than 60 million tons of
trash by 1994, and there will not be enough space to bury it.
   He blamed the wasteful use of computer paper in offices and
consumers' growing use of disposable products, such as plastic
bottles and even cameras.
   In addition, people are buying new home appliances and throwing
out old refrigerators, televisions and the like in vast numbers, he
said.
   In Tokyo, Japan's largest city, paper from offices accounts for
about 42 percent of the city's trash, while kitchen garbage makes
up 37 percent. Plastics, metals, glass and other materials account
for the rest.
   Aside from landfill disposal, Tokyo uses 13 incineration plants
to get rid of trash, but these are able to handle only 80 percent
of the city's burnable trash, Hayakawa said, adding that the
problem is similar in many other parts of the country.

<HEAD>Students Clash With Riot Police During Protest Of Giant Governing

   Riot police fired barrages of tear gas
today to disperse students throwing firebombs and shouting
``Overthrow (President) Roh Tae-woo!''
   Clashes erupted at Seoul's Yonsei University when police blocked
a march by about 2,000 dissidents and radical students protesting
the recent creation of a giant governing party.
   Riot police backed by armored vans firing scores of tear gas
shells moved about 70 yards onto the campus to disperse the
protesters. About 1,000 police surrounded the school.
   During an earlier rally at the university, the dissidents vowed
to launch an anti-Roh campaign across the nation, shouting ``Let's
destroy the ruling party.''
   The fighting lasted for an hour. Groups of masked students
dashed out with firebombs that exploded in orange flames in the
streets. It was not known immediately how many were injured. News
reports said police took away about 400 students.
   During a street rally in the central provincial city of Taejon,
opposition leader Kim Dae-jung urged President Roh Tae-woo to
disband his governing party or face a national vote of confidence.
   Kim's aides said about 100,000 supporters attended the peaceful
rally. Police put the number at 20,000.
   In Kim's southern hometown of Kwangju, police fired tear gas to
disperse about 300 students trying to attack a ruling party office
with firebombs and rocks. No damage and injuries were reported.
   The opposition leader accused Roh of backpedaling from his
promised reforms and demanded Roh immediately dismantle the party
formed in January through a merger of Roh's governing party and two
opposition groups.
   Roh has introduced broad reforms since he took office in
February 1988 and sent his authoritarian predecessor to disgraceful
rural exile. In recent months, however, critics have accused him of
ignoring calls for further reforms.

<HEAD>California Community Ranked Best in `Micropolitan' City Survey</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENISE CABRERA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The best small community in the United States
to call home is the San Luis Obispo-Atascadero, Calif., area and
the worst is Nampa-Caldwell, Idaho, according to a newly published
book.
   ``The Rating Guide to Life in America's Small Cities'' ranks all
219 ``micropolitan'' areas for their desirability as alternatives
to living in the nation's large metropolitan centers.
   San Luis Obispo's ``easygoing charm'' and ``mild climate''
helped earned it the top ranking.
   ``The town barricades its main thoroughfare, allows farmers and
vendors to sell food, and stages a weekly street fair'' every
Thursday, the book noted.
   The book's author, G. Scott Thomas, defines micropolitans as
cities of between 15,000 and 50,000 people in counties of at least
40,000 population.
   The communities cannot be part of regions designated as
metropolitan areas by the U.S. government as of June 15, 1989. Most
suburban communities are disqualified because they are included in
metropolitan areas.
   ``More than 15 million people live in micropolitan America,
nearly 6.5 percent of the nation's population,'' said Thomas.
   In 20 states, the smaller cities make up 10 percent of the
population, with Idaho having the highest proportion at slightly
more than 35 percent, he added.
   In a few states, the cities included are independent and not
located in counties.
   One city, Decatur, Ala., which the government designates as a
metropolitan area, is considered a micro by Thomas.
   The District of Columbia and four states _ Hawaii,
Massachusetts, New Jersey and South Dakota _ have no micropolitan
areas.
   The cities were assigned a points in 10 categories: climate,
economics, education, health care, housing, public safety,
transportation, urban proximity, sophistication and diversions.
   The latter two categories measured things such as voter turnout,
population turnover, newspaper readership, movie theaters, parks,
golf courses, restaurants and retail stores.
   The maximum possible score was 1,000.
   The top five micropolitans, in rank order, are San Luis
Obispo-Atascadero, Calif.; Corvallis, Ore.; Fredericksburg, Va.;
Fairbanks, Alaska; and Wenatchee, Wash.
   The bottom five are Minden, La.; Gallup, N.M.; Rio Rancho, N.M.;
Lumberton, N.C. and Nampa-Caldwell, Idaho.

<HEAD>Budget Squeeze Could Torpedo `Hate Crimes' Program, Sponsor Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is believed ready to sign a
bill requiring the government to keep track of ``hate crimes''
against minorities, but the sponsor says the program could be
torpedoed by a budget squeeze at the FBI.
   ``The implementation of the landmark hate crimes legislation
will be severely hampered if the staff responsible for
administering the law at the FBI is reduced,'' Rep. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y., said.
   Schumer made his comment came Friday after the FBI acknowledged
that it is considering a proposal to discontinue its uniform crime
report _ an annual count of crimes in America.
   Under the recently approved hate crimes bill, the Justice
Department is to keep statistics on offenses related to race,
religion, sexual orientation and ethnicity as part of the uniform
crime report.
   Approval of the hate crimes bill followed complaints about a
wave of such offenses on the part of neo-Nazi skinheads and other
bigot groups. A 1988 Justice Department report, however, said no
such statistics were available.
   The Bush administration supported the measure, which was
sponsored in the House by Schumer, and the president was expected
to sign it this week.
   FBI officials, however, told Schumer at a hearing Thursday that
a budget squeeze was draining manpower from their
statistics-gathering staff.
   They said a proposal that would in effect eliminate the
60-year-old crime reports was under consideration by the records
management division as a way to help absorb the manpower cuts.
   FBI officials said a longstanding drive by the Office of
Management and Budget to slash payroll and channel work to private
contractors was responsible for much of the reduction in manpower.
   They said the records division has lost 258 positions since 1987
and plans call for elimination of 92 more. The division has more
than 1,100 employees
   Special Agent J. Harper Wilson, in charge of the uniform crime
reports, said his staff might be spared the brunt of the cuts but
would have to absorb at least 30 and more likely far more than that.
   Schumer issued a statement Friday, saying that ``at a time when
information on overall crime is woefully thin, the Bush
administration should be moving forcefully to bolster its
understanding of crime, not undermining it. I hope the president
personally intervenes to prevent these cutbacks.''
   ``Without it, his signing into law of the hate crimes measure
would be little more than an empty gesture,'' he added.
   Schumer also sent a letter to Attorney General Dick Thornburgh,
saying that a large staff cut ``would eviscerate the bureau's
ability to collect and distribute the uniform crime reports.''
   The Justice Department also maintains a separate data-gathering
arm, the Bureau of Justice Statistics.

   An earthquake rocked eastern Turkey early
Saturday, causing damage in some villages, the semi-official
Anatolia News Agency reported. There were no immediate reports of
injuries.
   The news agency said the quake damaged houses in eight villages
in Cayirli township.
   The quake measured 5.4 on the Richter scale. A quake of
magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage.
   The Richter scale gauges the amount of energy released by an

   Sandinista activists shut down the
nation's banks to demand higher wages and press the Contra rebels
to disband.
   Sandinista labor leaders said they wanted to make certain with
Friday's strike that the rebels would honor a pledge earlier this
week to lay down their arms after a nine-year U.S.-backed civil war.
   ``We don't have any confidence that the Contras will comply with
these accords,'' said Luis Jimenez, vice secretary of the national
Sandinista union.
   The United Nations Security Council on Friday night instructed
the U.N. Observer Group in Central America to expand its efforts in
Nicaragua by monitoring the cease-fire and separation of government
and rebel forces. It already has been overseeing the surrender of
some rebel arms.
   The U.S.-backed administration of President-elect Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro is scheduled to take over Wednesday after 10
years of leftist Sandinista government. The opposition coalition
she leads, the United National Opposition, won the Feb. 25
elections.
   Sandinista Interior Minister Tomas Borge on Friday bade farewell
to thousands of police in an emotional ceremony. Borge, with tears
in his eyes, said in an hourlong speech that he leaves office with
his ``hands clean of blood and gold.''
   In 10 years as head of Nicaragua's internal security, Borge
said, ``we never tortured one prisoner.''
   The Sandinista union, which represents about 70,000 workers, had
threatened a general strike earlier this week if no agreement was
reached on disarming the Contras.
   The demobilization accord signed Thursday established an
immediate truce and called for the Contras to disband by June 10.
The accord holds out the promise of peace after a war that killed
30,000 people, mostly civilians.
   President Daniel Ortega, has pledged to work for a smooth
transition of power and tried to calm the labor unrest.
   ``These struggles are just, but the problems can't be resolved
overnight,'' he said in a nationally broadcast speech Thursday
night. He said it would be impossible to grant salary increases of
up to 200 percent demanded by some workers.
   Telephone, water and brewery workers as well as teachers staged
work stoppages Thursday. Health workers, university employees and
workers at a number of state-owned companies have also staged brief
strikes in the past week.
   Electrical workers and butchers in several provinces are
threatening a weekend walkout, according to reports in
pro-Sandinista newspapers.

   A Northwest Airlines flight from Detroit to
Atlanta was delayed nearly four hours when a pilot refused to fly
the plane after a passenger accused him of being drunk, according
to the airline.
   The pilot, who had been called in Thursday night after the
scheduled pilot was delayed en route from Milwaukee, insisted that
he be given an alcohol and drug test to prove he was sober, the
Star Tribune reported today.
   The plane was delayed nearly four hours while another substitute
pilot was procured. When the plane finally left, the passenger and
her husband stayed behind because other passengers were enraged
with them, Northwest spokesman Douglas Miller said Friday.
   The woman and her husband were ``subjected to quite a bit of
verbal abuse from the other passengers and they elected not to take
the flight,'' Miller said. The couple took another flight Friday
morning.
   The woman was Ann Beaver of the Detroit suburb of Bloomfield
Hills, said Northwest spokesman Bob Gibbons. A call to her home
this morning was answered by the woman's stepson, Brad Beaver, who
said she and her husband, Harvey, were in Atlanta on vacation and
probably wouldn't be available until Sunday afternoon.
   Miller said the airline supports the pilot's actions. ``We feel
he was justified,'' Miller said.
   The pilot, whose name was not released, had been called in by
Northwest when the scheduled pilot was delayed, Miller said.
   Thursday's incident happened aboard Flight 497, due to leave
Detroit at 8:30 p.m. The rest of the crew was ready to take off but
the pilot hadn't arrived, Miller said, and with no captain
available, Northwest called an off-duty pilot who lives in the
Detroit area.
   While the passengers waited for the substitute to drive the 50
miles to the airport, the woman began talking to other passengers
on the plane, saying the substitute was probably drunk or partying,
Miller said.
   When the substitute pilot arrived, flight attendants told him of
the woman's concerns and he took her aside and asked if she had a
problem, Miller said.
   ``She indicated that she was concerned about his ability to fly
the plane,'' Miller said. ``He then insisted that he be tested for
alcohol and drugs because he didn't want to give any impression or
credence to this woman's accusations.''
   The pilot left the plane and went to a clinic, where samples of
his blood and urine were taken. The blood test came back late
Friday and showed no alcohol in his system, Miller said. The urine
test was to be completed Monday.
   But because the tests and results were not available immediately
Thursday, Northwest had to bring in another pilot to fly the plane,
Miller said.
   Three Northwest pilots were arrested March 8 in Minneapolis,
where they were accused of flying from Fargo, N.D. while drunk.
They were fired by the airline and face state and federal charges.

   Iran's foreign minister left for New York
Saturday to hold talks with U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de
Cuellar on reviving stalled peace talks with Iraq, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
   The report, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati as saying that he and his Iraqi counterpart, Tarek
Aziz, will meet separately with Perez de Cuellar.
   He said Perez de Cuellar requested the meetings in an effort to
facilitate a new round of peace talks.
   Peace talks between Tehran and Baghdad started five days after a
cease-fire on Aug. 20, 1988 halted eight years of hostilities
between the two neighbors.
   But the talks stalled immediately, mainly over the question of
priorities.
   Tehran wants Iraqi troops to withdraw from Iranian territory
captured in the closing weeks of the war before the two sides
discuss other points such as a prisoner exchange.
   Iraq wants priority given to clearing the Shatt-Al-Arab
waterway, the confluence of the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers,
which is its main outlet to the Persian Gulf.
   The waterway, which forms the border between the two states, has
been closed since the early days of the war and is now blocked by
wrecked ships and other war debris.

   Chadian forces attacked Libyan-backed
rebels for the second time in three days, killing 103 guerrillas
and taking 45 prisoner, the army claimed Saturday.
   The fighting took place Friday along the country's eastern
border with Sudan in a reconnaissance operation following a battle
Wednesday that left 517 rebels dead, the high command reported.
   There was no mention of government losses.
   A television journalist accompanying the Chadian troops said
rebel commanders Moussa Haroun and Youssouf Adoum were among the
prisoners.
   Chadian forces seized 27 pickup trucks equipped with multiple
rocket launchers, machine guns or light cannon and destroyed 28
similar vehicles, the statement said. Numerous small arms were also
captured.
   ``The frequency and ferocity of these battles demonstrates the
excessive, demented obstinacy of Tripoli,'' the statement said.
   Chad says Libya supplies the rebel group, called the Legion,
with arms and training. Libya denies the organization exists.
   The rebels normally cross into western Chad from bases in the
lightly populated Darfur province in eastern Sudan, where the
Khartoum government exercises virtually no control.
   Renewed fighting in the sporadic civil war broke out last month
when rebels took government outposts at Bahai and Tine. Chadian
troops later recaptured the positions.
   The battles have caused France to reinforce its garrisons in
eastern Chad with 146 paratroopers, a second transport aircraft and
a military surgical unit. France had been stationing about 1,000
troops in its former African colony.
   Libya, which once occupied most of northern Chad, was chased out
three years ago in a series of defeats. Tripoli still claims as its
own a strip of land on Chad's northern border, the Aouzou Strip.
   In a peace agreement signed last September, Libya and Chad
reconfirmed their cease-fire, agreed to the exchange of prisoners
of war and to submitting their territorial dispute to international
arbitration.

   Lech Walesa turned back two challengers
today to win re-election as chairman of Solidarity, the union that
toppled Communist hard-liners but is losing popularity while the
country makes the painful switch to capitalism.
   Some members had claimed Walesa was undemocratic in his manner
of running Solidarity.
   Walesa, the shipyard electrician who has held the top job since
Solidarity's birth, received 77.5 percent of the valid votes, the
union's election commission said.
   Delegates to the union's second national congress welcomed the
announcement of the results by chanting ``Leszek, Leszek, Leszek,''
a diminutive form of Walesa's first name.
   The election for chairman took place on the third day of the
congress, which is meeting in this Baltic port city, the birthplace
of Solidarity during a nationwide strike wave in August 1980.
   The congress, scheduled to end Tuesday, is expected to outline
the union's stand on the economic reform program of the
Solidarity-led government. The reform is aimed at bringing the
moribund economy back to life and transforming it from Communist
central planning to a market-oriented system, but it has thrown
about 200,000 people out of work.
   The delegates, selecting a leader to shape the union's role in
post-Communist Poland, cast 362 balllots for Walesa, 52 for veteran
activist Andrzej Slowik and 25 for Tomasz Wojcik, a little-known
local strike leader.
   ``I am very happy but I am aware of what a cross, a union cross,
a Polish cross, we are to bear,'' Walesa told the congress after
his victory.
   ``What's before us is even more difficult than what is behind us
... We shall not waste the heritage of generations,'' he said.
   Walesa's re-election comes at a time when recent public opinion
polls show the union losing popularity due to the Solidarity-led
government's austerity measures. Walesa, who won the Nobel Peace
Prize in 1983 for his leadership of Solidarity, remains popular.
   Internal union tensions, including charges that Walesa's methods
are undemocratic, have surfaced during the congress debates. But
none of Solidarity's best-known activists decided to challenge the
charismatic Walesa.
   Walesa himself proposed the candidacy of Slowik, a bus driver
and union leader from the central city of Lodz who has often
advocated a more militant course for Solidarity. Slowik opposed any
concessions to the Communists during the negotiations that led to
the re-legalization of Solidarity in April 1989 after a seven-year
ban.
   Wojcik, the other candidate, is a chemist who helped lead 1988
strikes against the then-Communist government in the Wroclaw region
of southwest Poland.
   Solidarity-backed candidates swept partially free parliamentary
elections nearly a year ago and took control of the government from
the Communists, installing Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a former union
adviser, as the East bloc's first non-Communist prime minister.
   Walesa on Friday rebuffed former union leaders who have charged
him with undemocratic leadership. On Friday, Walesa won a vote of
confidence from the delegates after delivering an impassioned
defense of his 10 years as union chairman.
   ``I am not the wisest guy but we are wise because we now have a
democracy,'' he said in an emotional address.
   Delegates responded by voting 357-1 in favor of a report on his
leadership since Solidarity's last congress in the fall of 1981.
There were 22 abstentions.
   Some delegates said they saw Walesa's leadership as essential to
keeping Solidarity together.
   Only about 2.2 million of the 10 million members the union
claimed in 1981 have joined since it won back its legal status a
year ago.

<TEXT>
   Premier Li Peng begins a trip to Moscow Monday
that neither side expects to accomplish much beyond reaffirming the
resumption of relations declared last May.
   Both countries, preoccupied with domestic issues, are eager to
submerge past hostilities but recognize the limitations of what
they can offer each other, economically or politically.
   Li's visit will be the first by a Chinese leader to the Soviet
Union in 26 years. He is returning the visit of President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev, who came to Beijing in May 1989 for the first
Chinese-Soviet summit in three decades.
   He is expected to sign a trade agreement, which presumably will
have limited significance as the two countries move away from
planned barter toward paying for goods in hard currency.
   Soviet sources said the two sides also would adopt principles
for reducing military confrontation along their 4,300-mile border,
but there would be no specifics on troop withdrawals.
   Trade has increased steadily since tensions began to ease in the
mid-1980s, and reached the equivalent of $2.8 billion last year.
   That still is less than China's trade with Taiwan or South
Korea, both anti-Communist states. Chinese trade policy is based on
exporting to the West, to obtain hard currency for technology and
machinery only the West can supply.
   Politically, it's a different world from 1960, when the two
Communist giants split over ideology.
   In a recent interview with Soviet reporters, Li said ``there is
no perfect model for developing socialism.'' He pledged that
relations would continue even if the Soviets ``think socialism is
no longer the ideal system,'' but said he saw no signs of the
Soviet Union veering from the socialist road.
   Traditional suspicions have deepened in the past year, however,
as the Soviet Union pursues reform while China's aging Marxists,
after crushing the democracy movement, dig in for a long
ideological siege.
   ``They don't openly criticize us,'' a Soviet official said,
``but God knows what they do in private.''
   It is said that senior leader Deng Xiaoping called Gorbachev a
``revisionist'' in an internal report and that Chinese leaders are
appalled by the Soviet Communist Party's renunciation of monopoly
rule.
   Analysts say longstanding differences rule out any kind of
alliance against the United States. One Western diplomat was asked
about the strategic significance of Li's trip to Moscow and
responded: ``Who the hell cares?''
   Li's trip should be much smoother than the one in 1964, when
Premier Chou En-lai met with Leonid I. Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin
in Moscow.
   Chou sat silently when others applauded Brezhnev's reference to
detente with the West, and snubbed his hosts by laying a wreath on
the tomb of Stalin, who was still a hero in China.
   Differences over Cambodia, the dismantling of communism in
Eastern Europe and increased Soviet contacts with Taiwan probably
will be kept private during this visit.
   The Chinese premier, who studied engineering in the Soviet Union
in the 1950s and speaks some Russian, can point to real progress in
relations during the past year.
   High-level party and military contacts have resumed and China's
Communist Party newspaper soon will reopen its Moscow office, which
was closed 30 years ago. The two countries now have 1,200 exchange
students, compared to 10 in 1983.
   Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency, said the visit will
have ``profound significance'' for peace in Asia and the world. It
also will give the two old adversaries some peace of mind so they
can tend to problems at home.

   Conventional wisdom says 1990 is not a good
year to run for office as an anti-abortion candidate, but don't
tell that to the National Right to Life Committee.
   The group is running high-profile campaigns for a number of
candidates despite defections by former supporters, polls that show
most voters are pro-choice and the possibility its efforts may
galvanize the opposition.
   The committee is getting a wary welcome from some pro-life
candidates who fear they may alienate voters if they emphasize
their opposition to abortion.
   Florida Gov. Bob Martinez, who called a special legislative
session on abortion but failed to push through a single
anti-abortion bill, was honored last week at a Right to Life rally
attended by 10,000 abortion opponents.
   The governor's pollster, David B. Hill, said the group ``just
happened to be meeting in Tallahassee. ... He would not have taken
a whole day (to see them) if it had been in Miami. This is not a
priority.''
   When Right to Life scheduled newspaper and radio ads earlier
this year for Penny Pullen, an ardent anti-abortion veteran in the
Illinois legislature, she asked that they be canceled.
   ``She didn't want to be perceived as a single-issue candidate,''
said Sandra Faucher, director of Right to Life's political action
committee. Pullen lost the GOP primary by 31 votes and awaits a
recount.
   It's unclear whether Pullen's race demonstrates the folly of
rejecting one's anti-abortion allies, as Faucher claims. But it
does illustrate the ambivalence the right-to-life movement is up
against at the same time the National Abortion Rights Action League
is basking in sudden popularity.
   ``We used to have to slip in through the back door,'' said NARAL
executive director Kate Michelman. ``Now candidates are coming to
us and we can't be in all the places we want to be.''
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, returned a $10,000 contribution from
NARAL in 1984. This year he's gone out of his way to contrast his
pro-choice views with the strict anti-abortion stand held by his
opponent, GOP Rep. Tom Tauke.
   NARAL is spending thousands of dollars on an independent
campaign against Tauke, with no discouragement from Harkin.
   Pro-choice candidates have been putting more emphasis on their
support for abortion rights since the Supreme Court last year gave
states more authority to restrict abortion. The ruling energized
pro-choice voters and gave them a few electoral victories, putting
some muscle behind polls showing a majority of Americans oppose
government involvement in the issue.
   Faucher and her pro-life allies lately have been shifting focus
from their ultimate goal of a constitutional amendment outlawing
abortion to less sweeping proposals that a majority of Americans
appear to support. The committee is stressing opposition to
taxpayer-funded, sex-selection and late-term abortions, and pushing
parental notification requirements.
   ``You have to deal with what is possible legislatively,''
Faucher said. ``Roe vs. Wade has not been overturned. You cannot
ban abortions anywhere.''
   The pro-choice side sees this as backpedaling. ``They've
retreated,'' said Harrison Hickman, who does polling for NARAL.
``When the other side has more soldiers than you do, a retreat is
dealing with reality.''
   NARAL's Michelman predicts the strategy won't work.
   ``The other side doesn't understand the polls,'' she said.
``When it comes to elections, what the voter wants to know is do
you support the legal right of a woman to have an abortion.''
   Both sides contend the opposition's advertising, mailings and
phone bank efforts are counterproductive and invite a backlash.
   Faucher cites a NARAL ad suggesting that Iowa women could end up
with fewer rights than Romanian women under pro-lifers such as
Tauke, Gov. Terry Branstad and Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Tom
Miller.
   She said the ad was ``so radical and extreme that the people of
Iowa are just going to shuck that off as crazy feminists.''
   On the other side, Harkin's camp welcomed a Right to Life ad
campaign attacking his abortion position, saying they expected it
to help Harkin more than Tauke. ``If the anti-choice forces want to
attack us on that issue, that's fine,'' said Harkin's political
director, Phil Roeder.
   Despite all the sound and fury from both sides, some strategists
believe neither side will make an impact. Hill, who does polling
for both Brandstad and Florida's Martinez, is one of them.
   ``It's beyond imagination that there would be an ad that would
awaken somebody for the first time to what the governor's point of
view is,'' Hill said of Martinez. As for Branstad, he said, ``His
position is so well-known. It's already gone to the bottom line''
and his approval ratings are above 60 percent.

   The struggle by World War I veterans for a
small pension makes it seem as if the trench fighting never stopped.
   Each year brings a new assault on a seemingly impregnable
position known as Capitol Hill. Each new wave is smaller, as those
who escaped bullets, gas, influenza and shrapnel are felled by time.
   More than 4.5 million Americans served from 1917 to 1918 _ 2
million ``over there'' with Gen. John J. Pershing's American
Expeditionary Force. Half a million or more risked their lives
elsewhere making ``the world safe for Democracy,'' according to the
organization Veterans of World War I.
   But these veterans _ the few that are left _ complain that they
never were recognized for their service the way other veterans
were. They say they were underpaid compared with their civilian
counterparts who profited from war production, and the Depression
devoured the meager benefits they were able to squeeze out of a
prostrate economy.
   Most were too old and settled by the end of World War II to take
advantage of the array of housing, educational and other benefits
offered in the GI Bill of Rights.
   So they tried again last week.
   ``Please help us over the top,'' Don R. Pears, 90, of Buchanan,
Mich., said at a joint hearing of the House and Senate Veterans
Affairs committees.
   After receiving a brief extension of his allotted time to
testify, Pears asked,``How many minutes do I have?''
   Not too many.
   Five years ago the World War I veterans were 171,000 strong. In
March 1989, there were 111,000. This past March there were 90,000,
and their average age was close to 95.
   Three-quarters of the veterans are in hospitals or nursing
homes, and the Department of Veterans Affairs estimates that by the
turn of the century there will be 7,000 left; by the year 2010,
fewer than 500.
   Some World War I veterans receive pensions based upon illness or
poverty. But the veterans group seeks passage of any of the
perennial handful of bills that would grant either a $10,000 lump
sum or $150 a month for veterans simply because they served in the
war. A smaller amount would go to widows over age 80.
   ``Several measures to provide a non-needs-based World War I
pension have been introduced in previous years,'' Sen. Alan
Cranston, D-Calif., and chairman of the Senate veterans committee,
says in a form letter to constituents. ``However, favorable action
has not been taken because of the great costs involved.''
   Cranston says poor or sick World War I veterans, their widows or
both receive a pension that exceeds by $1,530 a year the normal VA
pension for veterans of other wars.
   The WWI veterans have gained at least one vocal ally in
Congress. Rep. Glenn M. Anderson, D-Calif., last month delivered a
long speech on the House floor in favor of H.R. 1918, one of the
pension bills, picking up about 25 more sponsors to bring the total
to 100. Anderson also wrote a letter last week to President Bush
calling attention to the veterans.
   Doughboys were paid $1 a day and received $60 to muster out.
They also won ``bonus'' payments over the vetoes of presidents
Coolidge and Roosevelt.
   The first bonus was a 1925 bond redeemable in 1945. Congress
freed the money in the 1930s, after veterans marched on Washington
and were routed by their former officers and future World War II
heroes _ Gen. Douglas MacArthur and Maj. George S. Patton.
   By then many of the bonds were in the hands of banks, since the
paper had been used as collateral for loans during lean times, says
Muriel Sue Parkhurst, executive director of the veterans group.
   ``That group of men is all gone,'' Gilmer T. Carter, 94, of
Winston-Salem, N.C., said, referring to the ``Bonus Expeditionary
Force,'' as the bonus marchers called themselves.
   The old, old men who came to Washington still act with grace and
humor. They are more prone to talk about the bad food, cold nights,
monotony and the absurdities of the soldier's life than
Chateau-Thierry, Argonne-Meuse or Belleau Wood.
   Many who were in Washington never got that close to the front.
   ``I was assigned to the `general intermediate storage depot,'''
Pears said in an interview. The G.I.S.D. patch he wore, however,
came to stand for ``Going Insane Serving Democracy.''
   Nor are any members of the ``last man'' clubs who annually
gather to drink toasts until the last one dies. ``I think all the
last men are gone already,'' said H. Louis Brooks, 91, of Toms
River, N.J.

<HEAD>Congress Asks How Many Consultants It Takes to Plant a Tree</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush's plan for planting a billion
trees is prompting members of Congress to ask why he needs $35
million to set up a foundation to accomplish that aim.
   Though no one questions the need for more trees, especially in
urban areas, the foundation was described by one congressman as a
pig in a poke.
   ``I envision that in today's world a lot of consultants would be
brought in,'' said Rep. Harold Volkmer, D-Mo.
   Volkmer heads the House Agriculture subcommittee on forests
which questioned Patricia Kearney, acting assistant agriculture
secretary for natural resources, last week about the president's
plan.
   The president's proposal seeks $175 million annually for five
years to achieve the goal of planting a billion trees per year, she
said.
   Of that amount, $35 million would be used by a foundation that
would seek donations for tree-planting from private corporations
and do promotions to encourage people to reforest, Kearney said.
   Though the names of the foundation members have not been
released, a White House spokeswoman said the group would include 20
to 25 people whose leaders would be announced soon.
   The spokeswoman, who asked not be identified, said White House
is moving forward with the foundation, despite the reluctance being
voiced by Congress.
   During questioning by the House, Kearney said the details of the
foundation had not been worked out.
   That caused Volkmer to lean forward and ask, ``Do you know what
a pig in a poke is?'' The phrase refers to buying something you
can't see.
   ``I never buy one,'' said Volkmer.
   ``I think there are some justifiable concerns about the public
trust,'' Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., told Kearney.
   Rep. Jim Olin, D-Va., asked why the government's Forest Service
couldn't do the work being suggested for the foundation.
   Kearney said the government couldn't do the private fund-raising
envisioned as a duty of the group. The $35 million, she said, would
leverage private dollars.
   Rep. Jim Jontz, D-Ind., said he supported the president's plan,
but thought it should be incorporated into legislation he
introduced that already has passed the House. That bill would
provide the government's technical assistance to those who plant
trees.
   ``You need a core of people to make sure the trees are being
taken care of. We need to do more to understand the urban
environment as a habitat for trees,'' Jontz said.
   John Rosenow, executive director of the National Arbor Day
Foundation, has other objections.
   He said he supports the president's initiative and likes the
money-raising aspect in the proposal, but ``the original proposal
for the tree trust foundation as drafted would be a duplication of
the Arbor Day Foundation.''
   In a telephone interview Friday from his Lincoln, Neb., office,
Rosenow said his organization's 800,000 members already work
nationally with existing groups and agencies throughout the country
to promote tree-planting.
   He is meeting with Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter next
weekend to discuss his concerns, he said.
   Other organizations also are working around the country to get
more trees in the ground.
   Fred Deneke, Forest Service assistant director for urban
community forestry, said the momentum began to grow about 10 or 12
years ago.
   He said people began to realize that the loss of trees in the
cities was not only an aesthetic problem but also causing urban
areas to be hotter. A city is often 5 to 9 degrees hotter than
outlying areas, he said.
   Deneke said ``street trees'' can bring down temperatures and
take some of the burden off air conditioners during the summer,
thereby saving precious fossil fuels. But, he said, only one such
tree is being planted for every four being lost.

<HEAD>Walesa Re-Elected As Solidarity Chairman</HEAD>

   Lech Walesa was re-elected as chairman of
Solidarity by an overwhelming margin Saturday, winning a mandate to
shape the union's future during the difficult transition from
communism to capitalism.
   In his victory speech, Walesa said the once-outlawed union
cannot rest on its laurels after removing the Communists from
power, but must bear responsibility for the country's future.
   ``I am very happy but I am aware of what a cross, a union cross,
a Polish cross, we are to bear,'' Walesa told delegates to
Solidarity's second national congress.
   ``What's before us is even more difficult than what is behind us
... We shall not waste the heritage of generations,'' he said.
   Delegates welcomed Walesa's victory over two challengers with
chants of ``Leszek, Leszek, Leszek,'' a diminutive of his first
name.
   Walesa, the shipyard electrician who has led Solidarity since
its birth in 1980, received 77.5 percent of the vote, the union's
election commission said.
   The delegates, selecting a leader to shape the union's role in
post-Communist Poland, cast 362 ballots for Walesa, 52 for veteran
activist Andrzej Slowik and 25 for Tomasz Wojcik, a little-known
local strike leader.
   Although Walesa was widely expected to win, he joked later that
``I was not that sure of the victory because I have done a lot of
mischief during the 10 years (as chairman).''
   The election took place on the third day of the congress, which
is meeting in a sports hall in this Baltic port city, the
birthplace of Solidarity during a nationwide strike wave in August
1980.
   The union held its last congress in the fall of 1981, just
months before it was suppressed under martial law.
   The six-day congress, scheduled to end Tuesday, also will draw
up a program determining Solidarity's future role now that it has
gone from being an opposition movement to being part of the
political establishment.
   Walesa's re-election comes as public opinion polls show the
union losing popularity, due to economic hardships brought by the
Solidarity-led government's shock treatment austerity program for
the country's moribund economy.
   Some union members had criticized Walesa for being undemocratic
in his means of running Solidarity, but none of the best-known
union activists challenged him.
   In order to ensure a choice, Walesa himself proposed the
candidacy of Slowik, a bus driver and union leader from the central
city of Lodz who has often advocated a more militant course for the
union. Slowik opposed any concessions to the Communists during the
negotiations that led to the re-legalization of Solidarity in April
1989 after a seven-year ban.
   Wojcik, a chemist, helped lead 1988 strikes against the
then-Communist government in the Wroclaw region in southwest Poland.
   In speeches before the balloting, Walesa and Slowik differed
over a key issue facing Solidarity _ whether the union should step
back from the political arena to emphasize its original trade union
goals of defending workers' interests.
   Walesa advocated an ``intermediate program'' mixing political
and trade union goals. But Slowik said Solidarity's only role
should be as ``the leadership of a trade union, not a social
movement or political party.''
   The congress is expected to outline the union's stand on the
government's economic reform program aimed at transforming Poland's
centrally planned communist economy into a market-oriented
capitalist system.
   In its initial stages, the reform's austerity measures have
raised prices and thrown about 200,000 people out of work.
   Solidarity-backed candidates swept partially free parliamentary
elections last June and took control of the government from the
Communists, installing Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a former union adviser,
as prime minister in the East bloc's first non-Communist government
in almost 40 years.
   But only about 2.2 million of the 10 million members the union
claimed in 1981 have joined since it won back its legal status a
year ago.
   Some critics have accused Walesa of viewing the union
chairmanship as only a stepping stone for an eventual bid for
president of Poland. The post is currently held by Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski, the former Communist Party leader who led the December
1981 martial law crackdown that suppressed Solidarity.
   Earlier this month, Walesa raised the possibility of running for
president, but then backed away. He said his remarks were meant
only to spur the government to make the needed political and
economic reforms.

   Tanya Tucker said she is searching for a new
assistant who won't contribute much more to her music than cutting
down on one little voice in the background.
   The country singer and single mom says she needs a nanny to help
her take care of 9-month-old daughter, Presley.
   ``I'm looking for a great woman who will come with me on the
road and do her job and not get caught up in the star scene, which
is what happened to the last one'' said Ms. Tucker, who performs at
a Dallas rodeo Sunday.
   ``I want someone that doesn't care about anything but her. If
there's a party going on, they don't need to be there.''
   Ms. Tucker's new album, ``There's a Tennessee Woman,'' is
scheduled to be released later this month.

   ``We hear about the horror stories and they are true,'' said
Jillian, who was here over the weekend to speak to a women's health

are legions of survivors out there.'' Jillian was diagnosed with
breast cancer in 1985.
   ``Every time I see a woman or man in the audience who is moved

   Ask most 14-year-old girls to name a role
model, and they might say Madonna or Paula Abdul. But Staci Keanan
of the NBC series ``My Two Dads'' has a different focus.
   ``Jack Nicholson has all the qualities that can't be taught,
like screen presence and the ability to laugh realistically. He's a
pretty amazing guy and I want to be a character actor like him,''
Keanan said.
   Her first feature movie, ``Lisa,'' is a far cry from situation
comedy. In the suspense film, which also stars Cheryl Ladd, Keanan
attracts a serial killer's attention after making flirtatious crank
calls.
   She identifies with the independent streak of her movie
character, Keanan said in a recent interview.
   ``It's OK for your parents to put controls on you that are for
your own good, but not ones that are just used to limit you. It's
like moving to America and then being told you can't go west of the
Mississippi.''

   Actress Colleen Dewhurst gave a group of
high school students a candid and sobering description of acting
calling it ``a profession of rejection.''
   ``You are told constantly you are wrong for it,'' said Ms.
Dewhurst, best known for her portrayals of the passionate women in
Eugene O'Neill's plays.
   A frequent joke at Equity, said the president of the Actors'
Equity Association, is: ``Once an actress, always a waitress.''
   Ms. Dewhurst recalled for the 20 drama students her own days as
a struggling student 44 years ago at New York's American Academy of
Dramatic Arts. ``It was more agony to get up in front of my peers
than to audition in front of strangers,'' she said Friday.
   ``The greatest destroyer I saw at school was the bitterness,''
Ms. Dewhurst cautioned the students of the struggle to get work.
   Her break finally came when she was cast as Kate, in Joseph
Papp's Shakespeare Festival production of ``The Taming of the
Shrew.''
   ``That was 14 years after I'd come to the city,'' she said.
``It's not easy, but it's worth it.''

   Veteran actor Sir Michael Hordern made his opera
debut at the age of 79 and confessed afterward he was terrified.
   But the audience at the London Coliseum cheered and applauded
his performance Friday night as the bewigged and powdered Major
Domo in Richard Strauss' ``Ariadne auf Nexos'' staged by the
English National Opera.
   In the only non-singing role, Hordern had to contend with a full
orchestra and move on a steeply sloping stage loaded with singers
and dancers.
   ``I once had a part in Spenser's `Faerie Queene' at Covent
Garden about 50 years ago but this is virtually my first opera
part,'' he said sipping champagne in his dressing room afterward.
   ``I was terrified. I always have first-night nerves. The trouble
is that with eight more performances, all spaced out, every time
will seem like a first night. But the audience was very kind and
made up for the terror.''
   The renowned Shakespearean actor played King Lear in the PBS
``Shakespeare Hour'' in the United States in 1986 and also starred
in the television version of John Mortimer's ``Paradise Postponed''
the same year.

   Batman's television sidekick, Robin,
wrote a $25,000 check that bounced, an architectural firm claims,
but actor Burt Ward says they're the bad guys because they were
asked to give it back and didn't.
   The check was written by the co-star of the 1960s television
series to TRA Architects Inc. in Ponte Vedra Beach on Oct. 1, 1988.
   Ward planned to have the firm do work for him and asked TRA to
hold the check while his company negotiated a land purchase in
Arkansas, he said Friday by telephone from his Beverly Hills,
Calif., office.
   When the land contract fell through, Ward said he asked TRA to
return the check. He said he was not aware the company tried to
cash the check until Friday and planned to contact his lawyer.
   ``It's really not nice,'' Ward said.
   Officials at TRA Architects declined to comment on the matter.
   TRA filed the complaint with the Jacksonville state attorney's
office, which is in the wrong county. The case will be turned over
to St. Johns County prosecutors, who handle Ponte Vedra Beach cases.
   ``We are going to have to let them pursue it,'' said Pamela
Simpson, director of the worthless check division at the state
attorney's office in Jacksonville.

<HEAD>Financier, Arms Merchant Adnan Khashoggi Appears Unfazed by Trial</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   At 3 a.m., the telephone buzzes Adnan Khashoggi
awake in his luxurious bedroom, 47 floors above Manhattan. The
Saudi Arabian financier plugs the phone into a transmitter locked
around his ankle, sends a signal and goes back to sleep.
   Most people who deal in billions of dollars and hobnob with
presidents and kings might think it demeaning to be monitored so.
But Khashoggi seems amused by this nightly ritual that lets
authorities check his whereabouts outside U.S. District Court,
where he is on trial with former Philippine first lady Imelda
Marcos.
   ``I call it the government's wake-up service. It wakes me up in
time for morning prayers,'' joked Khashoggi, a Moslem. Raising a
pants leg to reveal the black, wristwatch-like gadget, he added:
``When this (trial) is over, I might go into selling these things.
This one, I am going to auction off _ for charity.''
   It wouldn't be the first time ``A.K.,'' as his intimates call
him, found a business opportunity in an unexpected place. He has
done that for years on his way to becoming one of the world's most
famous citizens and, for a time, perhaps its richest.
   Despite a series of business setbacks in recent years, Khashoggi
is so wealthy that numbers are almost irrelevant. ``Adnan would
consider himself penniless if he was down to his last hundred
million,'' says James Linn, his lawyer.
   Khashoggi, 54, is vague about his current worth but doubts that
he ever was the world's richest man. He says that title belongs to
his friend the Sultan of Brunei.
   His wealth may be best judged by his bail. He put up the
required $10 million, but authorities said it was small change to
Khashoggi, and feared he would forfeit it for freedom. He was
released from jail only after King Fahd of Saudi Arabia sent a
letter guaranteeing that he would not attempt to flee, and after he
agreed to wear the monitoring device.
   In an interview at his lavish apartment, with its artworks by
Dufy and Miro and its sweeping views of the city, Khashoggi
described an investment portfolio that once ranged over 35
countries.
   ``In my heyday I used to earn $80 million to $100 million a year
and probably spent, on this style of life, $40 million,'' he said.
``But when they say I am the world's richest man, how do they come
to this conclusion? I don't have $10 billion in the bank.''
   When a $600 million Salt Lake City project went bust in 1987, he
lost $300 million. ``That was the beginning of the disaster
stories. Because it was me, everybody thought I went bankrupt, but
it was not true,'' he said.
   Khashoggi reportedly was a middleman and financier of the
Iran-Contra affair, in which profits from secret U.S. arms sales to
Iran were channeled to rebel groups fighting the Sandinista
government of Nicaragua.
   In his opening statement at the trial, Linn tried to dispel the
idea that there was something wrong with being an arms trader,
saying all Khashoggi's arms dealings had U.S. and Saudi government
approval.
   Khashoggi describes himself as an ``international salesman,''
and ``merchant banker.'' He insists there is nothing sinister or
mysterious about what he does.
   ``I am a hard-working man, and I have to pay my bills,'' he
said. ``I am just like you _ with a few extra zeros.''
   Despite his wealth, Khashoggi takes the subway to and from court
to avoid traffic. Last week, when the train stalled, he walked 29
blocks home; few passersby took notice of the short, portly man
talking into a hand-held telephone as he strode up Park Avenue.
   In court, he dozes off occasionally as testimony focuses mainly
on Mrs. Marcos' alleged financial misdeeds.
   The government claims she and her late husband, Ferdinand,
looted their country's treasury of about $220 million, depositing
some in secret Swiss bank accounts and spending more on lavish
living and real estate purchases.
   Khashoggi is charged with mail fraud and obstruction of justice.
It is alleged that he forged documents to help conceal the Marcoses
ownership of four New York office buildings and an art collection
bought with stolen funds.
   He concedes that he was ``foolish'' to get involved with the
Marcoses, but contends he committed no crime because the document
backdating occurred in 1985, the year before Marcos was ousted from
power and a U.S. court froze all transactions involving the
buildings.
   ``When you ask me why this trial is unfair, it is because they
(the prosecutors) know all this,'' he said. ``Without me, they
don't have a case. They want to get the Marcoses, by hook or by
crook.''
   Khashoggi said he believes Judge John F. Keenan eventually will
dismiss the charges against him, but if not, he'll be acquitted by
the jury.
   ``These people are not going to be unfair,'' he said.
   And he contended the trial is doing great damage to America's
image in the Middle East.
   ``This case has become a symbol of fear,'' he said. ``I am
trying to say, `Hey, guys, this is not America.' We will have our
day in court and they will see that it is not America, but a corner
street called New York.''

<TEXT>
   The walls of John Tower's downtown office hold
daily reminders of the Cabinet post that escaped the grasp of the
former senator and arms control negotiator.
   Both the swords from West Point and the photograph of President
Bush with his first nominee to run the Pentagon testify to the time
not too long ago when Tower, 64, thought he might become secretary
of Defense.
   Tower's rejection in March 1989 by his former colleagues capped
a rancorous period in the brief history of the Bush administration
and the long tradition of Senate comity.
   Charges of womanizing and alcoholism were leveled at the former
Texas senator, while Republicans were bitter in their accusations
of Democratic partisanship.
   More than a year later, Tower remains on the fringes of defense
work. Dividing his time between Dallas and Washington, he serves on
Bush's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, teaches a course at
Southern Methodist University on national security policy and does
consulting.
   He doesn't consult for defense contractors. Tower's ties with
them also prevented his confirmation.
   In an interview last week, Tower provided a hint of the defense
budget he would have crafted in light of the revolutionary changes
in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
   ``I worry a little bit that the budget is anticipating changes
that are going to take place before they take place,'' said Tower,
who sat across the table from the Soviets during the Reagan
administration. ``We have not completed our negotiations in two
important areas.''
   Tower believes that the administration and Congress should wait
until U.S.-Soviet treaties to reduce strategic weapons and
conventional arms have been satisfactorily completed before
military cuts are made.
   ``I get a little concerned about our, in effect, conceding an
advantage to the other side by making unilateral reductions before
mutual reductions have been negotiated,'' he said.
   The former chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee
dismisses characterization as a Cold Warrior, and says he is
optimistic about the prospects for a U.S. agreement with Moscow.
   His stand, however, is far closer to that of Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney than several Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
   ``We have to continue our strategic modernization ... because
the threat has not yet significantly diminished and because we are
in the process of negotiating strategic arms reductions,'' Tower
said.
   He favors development of the B-2 stealth bomber, describing it
as essential to the modernization of the airborne leg of the triad
and as a key element in the nuclear deterrent.
   Opposition to the radar-evading plane _ considered the most
expensive in history at more than $530 million a copy _ is
increasing in Congress. Tower acknowledges that the battle over the
bat-winged bomber will be contentious.
   Although his support for the Strategic Defense Initiative came
under attack from leading conservatives last year, he favors some
type of anti-missile shield.
   ``I think it's prudent to proceed with deployment of at least a
rudimentary SDI system,'' Tower said. ``Bear in mind that the
Soviets do have in place an anti-ballistic missile system. We do
not.''
   This year is a transition year, according to Tower.
   Only after U.S.-Soviet treaties can the Pentagon set its sights
on a military that emphasizes ``force projection capability rather
than the maintenance of massive land armies and large numbers of
strategic weapons,'' he said.
   On the dispute between Cheney and CIA Director William Webster
over the level of the Soviet threat, Tower believes both are
correct.
   ``I think it would be very difficult for a hardliner to turn
back the clock,'' he said. ``However, the enormous military power
of the Soviet Union has not diminished during the course of the
Gorbachev regime. Perhaps in terms of numbers it has, but not in
terms of capability.''
   Tower won't comment directly on the Cheney military blueprint,
explaining, ``I've not walked a mile in his moccasins.''

   When New England's long winter starts
surrendering to spring, New Hampshire's citizens get a special gift
_ a long holiday weekend heralded in the heavens by Halley's Comet
three centuries ago.
   The state of many onlys and firsts on Monday will once again be
the only one to celebrate Fast Day.
   The holiday was originally a day for New Hampshire colonists to
fast and pray for their ailing governor. Now it's the time when
folks pack away snow tires and storm windows, bring out the
baseball gloves and bats and lawn rakes, and shop the Fast Day
sales.
   The first known fast day was observed by Massachusetts after the
drought of 1622, but in New Hampshire, the practice dates from the
1680s, after the appearance of Halley's Comet was divined as a
portent of the demise of the colony's first governor, John Cutts.
   When Cutts fell ill, citizens were urged to set aside March 17,
1681, to pray and fast for his recovery, a custom peculiar to New
England in times of fear of impending catastrophe.
   In 1894, Massachusetts substituted its Fast Day with Patriots
Day to memorialize the Revolutionary War. Massachusetts and Maine
observe Patriots Day on the third Monday in April. That leaves New
Hampshire with the only Fast Day, now marked on the fourth Monday
of April.
   In New Hampshire, little is known about Cutts, other than that
he was ``President of the Royal Province ... by grace of Charles
II,'' was an immigrant from Wales, and sometimes spelled his name
Cutt.
   Cutts was the richest merchant in Portsmouth, the colonial
capital. On May 6, 1680, when he was 60, he had a foreboding of his
death and wrote his will. By the following year, he was so ill that
the colonial General Assembly declared a day of ``fasting,
humiliation and prayer'' for his recovery.
   His death, the assembly feared, would ``occasion much trouble''
and noted ``that awful, portentous, blazing star, usually
foreboding sore calamity'' _ the comet whose path was being plotted
in England by the 25-year-old astronomer Edmund Halley.
   The special day didn't help Cutts, who died April 1, 1681, but
his Fast Day lived on.
   Other things, however, have changed. Church attendance no longer
is compulsory and citizens no longer must listen to sermons such as
``Three of the Public Evils of the Day: Public Education,
Extravagance, Intemperance.''
   Recreation no longer is forbidden and the 10-shilling fine
against those taking part in ``labour, business or work of their
ordinary calling'' was abolished long ago.
   Fast Day since has been transformed into a time of relaxation
and recreation with extravagance of mercantile promotions rivaled
only by Presidents Day sales.
   State offices have stayed open for the past five years, thanks
to a contract provision that makes Fast Day a floating holiday that
some state workers take at another time.
   But school is out and banks and some city and town offices
close, leaving plenty of shoppers and rakers and ball players to
enjoy the budding spring.

   President Bush is giving Mikhail
Gorbachev a few more days to loosen the economic noose the Kremlin
is tightening to keep Lithuania inside the Soviet Union.
   Bush set off fishing this morning, clad in a green shirt,
camouflage pants, red cap and white satin Wyoming centennial
jacket. ``Wish us luck,'' was the vacationing president's only
comment to reporters as the party left on Florida Marine Patrol
speedboats.
   On Friday the White House put Moscow on notice to expect a U.S.
response early next week unless Gorbachev lets up against the
rebellious republic.
   Bush himself said nothing during political speeches Friday in
Birmingham, Ala., and Orlando, Fla., about the crisis threatening a
setback for U.S.-Soviet relations.
   Asked as he toured Orlando's Sea World why he needed more time
to frame a response, Bush said only, ``There's a lot of
consultations going on right now.''
   But amid reports the Soviets were intercepting food supplies and
shutting off Lithuania's oil and gas, and eyewitness accounts of
troopers seizing a printing plant in Vilnius, White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater decried what he called ``another unfortunate
step'' in the Soviet economic crackdown.
   A senior U.S. official today said Secretary of State James Baker
had had a telephone discussion about Lithuania with Soviet Foreign
Minister Edouard Shevardnadze early Friday afternoon. A previous
telephone conversation between the two was announced on Wednesday.
   Baker's consistent approach to the Soviets has been a call for a
peaceful solution to the dispute with the maverick republic.
   Bush flew by helicopter from Homestead Air Force Base late
Friday night after helping fill Republican coffers with more than
$2 million in Birmingham and Orlando. He was accompanied by
national security adviser Brent Scowcroft, Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady, Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., and Overseas Private
Investment Corp. Chairman Fred Zeder, on hand to join the fishing
expedition.
   Fitzwater, standing in a hotel driveway in Birmingham, said Bush
had ``stepped up'' consultations with U.S. allies and would meet
early next week with leaders of Congress before taking action.
   Administration officials reiterated that Bush was contemplating
making the Soviets pay an economic price for the campaign to force
the Baltic republic to retreat from its March 11 declaration of
independence.
   Bush has been treading cautiously, trying to promote a peaceful
dialogue that would respect the Lithuanians' right to
self-determination and not cloud U.S.-Soviet relations and
prospects for nuclear arms negotiations.
   Fitzwater said the United States still hopes ``this matter can
be resolved in a responsible manner.''
   He said the president would complete his deliberations ``early
next week,'' and meet with lawmakers ``to discuss possible courses
of action.''
   ``I would assume that we would be prepared to announce actions
fairly soon after that,'' the spokesman said.
   When asked why Bush needed more time to frame a response,
Fitzwater replied, ``Because many of the actions that we would
contemplate taking would involve other countries, would have
international implications, and we therefore think it's important
that we touch base with our allies on this issue.''
   The administration already has signaled that the most likely
U.S. action against Moscow would be economic, such as trade, rather
than a slowdown in arms negotiations or discussions of regional
disputes.
   Bush and Gorbachev agreed at the Malta summit last December on
expanded commercial contacts that now stand in jeopardy.
   Asked if any sort of military reprisal were possible, Fitzwater
said, ``We've said from the beginning that we didn't anticipate
military involvement.''
   Bush was spending the weekend at a private condominium on a
stretch of Florida Keys 75 miles south of Miami.
   He was loudly applauded at the Florida GOP dinner in Orlando
when he predicted that democracy will come to Cuba, which he called
the ``one last hard-line holdout in the West.''
   ``It will happen. The people of Cuba will be free. I guarantee
you that,'' said Bush, who also criticized the Senate for not
passing his $800 million emergency aid package for the new regimes
in Panama and Nicaragua.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere said
Saturday that a new wave of frustrated East Germans will head west
unless their wages and pensions are valued at West German standards.
   In his toughest remarks yet on the issue, the East German leader
said he would not back down from his demand that most East German
marks be converted equally to West German marks as the nations are
unified.
   ``As far as wages, salaries and pensions are concerned, it is
not negotiable,'' he said in an joint interview on East and West
German radio.
   West Germany's central bank has said most East German marks must
be converted at a 2-1 exchange, and that an equal trade would erode
the power of the mighty West German mark and result in higher
interest rates and inflation.
   The nonconvertible East German mark is essentially worthless in
free market economies.
   But de Maiziere said the 1-1 rate is needed to offset the
effects of eliminating the vast price and rent subsidies of East
Germany's former socialist government.
   He said that not granting the 1-1 conversion could result in a
new flood of East Germans to the West. More than 500,000 East
Germans have migrated to West Germany in the past year.
   Many left after the former Communist government opened the East
German borders in November in an attempt to quell massive
pro-democracy demonstrations.
   The protests brought down old Stalinist regime and de Maiziere
was chosen prime minister after his party won the most votes in
East Germany's first free elections on March 18.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl said on Saturday that the West German
mark will definitely become the currency of East Germany on July 2,
the East German news agency ADN said. Both governments previously
had set that date to merge their currencies.
   Kohl, during an appearance in Wolfsburg, West Germany, also said
the currency exchange demands in East Germany will be taken into
consideration during negotiations, ADN said.
   He also said that joint elections in a unified Germany could
conceivably be held in the latter third of next year, but that he
wouldn't seek to postpone the West German elections on Dec. 2, ADN
said.
   Both Germanys say unification is inevitable, but there has been
increased sniping in recent weeks over how to mesh East Germany's
decaying socialist economy with the wealthy west.
   The two Germanys are to begin talks within two weeks on merging
their economies as a prelude to eventual full unification.
   The government of West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has been
putting together its own proposal for a monetary union.
   In a report to be published on Monday, the West German magazine
Der Spiegel said the Kohl government will in fact grant 1-1
exchanges on East German savings accounts of 5,000 marks (about
$2,800) to 8,000 marks (about $4,700) or less.
   The report said some wages and pensions also would receive a 1-1
exchange.
   It said the conversion would cost about 40 billion marks ($23
billion) a year.
   A West German government spokesman, speaking on condition of
anonymity, dismissed the Der Spiegel report as ``speculation.''
   Both Germanys say they want to combine their economies by July
1. Talks involving the superpowers also are expected in the coming
weeks on the strategic future of a united Germany.

<DATELINE>ZAGREB, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Slovenia and Croatia, Communist
Yugoslavia's wealthiest republics, observed a day of silence
Saturday ahead of crucial elections that may determine the fate of
this fragile Balkan country.
   In Croatia, voters will choose Sunday among more than 30 parties
vying for parliamentary seats in the republic's first multiparty
elections in 50 years.
   In Slovenia's second-round balloting, 1.4 million people who
voted on April 8 will elect the state president and 65 remaining
parliamentary deputies.
   Under existing law, all campaign activities stop a day before
the elections to give citizens a chance to think about their
decisions before voting.
   Slovenia and Croatia have liberal judiciaries and media, unlike
Yugoslavia's largest republic of Serbia, and they are already
pushing for closer ties with the West.
   If pro-independence forces win in both republics, they would
move further away from Serbia's hard-line Communist leadership and
could tear apart the loose federation of six republics and two
autonomous provinces.
   Slovenian voters will choose between Milan Kucan, a reform
Communist who steered the republic to a multiparty democracy, and
Joze Pucnik, an advocate of Slovenian independence.
   Kucan won 44.6 percent of first-round voting in Slovenia, the
most prosperous of Yugoslavia's republics. Pucnik, who heads the
center-right DEMOS coalition, was second with 26.6 percent.
   DEMOS, an alliance of five opposition parties, won about 55
percent of the vote for the state legislature and, barring an
upset, was expected to form the first non-Communist government in
Yugoslavia since 1945.
   In Croatia, the second-largest republic behind Serbia, 16
representatives of the U.S. Republican and Democratic Parties will
monitor the elections, said Milko Gajski, president of the local
election commission.
   Three main political groupings and a host of smaller parties
will field 1,706 candidates in Croatia's elections for 356 seats in
the three-chamber state legislature.
   The three main contenders are the Croatian Democratic Union, the
Coalition for National Accord and the reformed Communist Party.
   During a two-hour televised debate that officially marked the
end of campaigning Friday, leaders of the three main groups
delivered their final message to the electorate.
   ``The debate showed that the differences between us are slim on
most issues,'' Anton Vujic of the centrist five-party Coalition.
   Differences center on whether Yugoslavia should become a
confederation in which states would have ``full sovereign rights,''
favored by the center-right Croatian Democratic Union, or remain a
federation, favored by the Communists.
   Critics in Serbia regularly accuse the Union of being
``extremist and fascist,'' and of planning to secede from
Yugoslavia if they win a parliamentary majority.
   Earlier this month, the Yugoslav army warned that any attempt by
Slovenia or Croatia to win independence from the rest of the
country ``will be prevented.''
   Mika Tripalo of Croatia's Coalition said his group advocates a
compromise _ a ``state contract'' signed by all republics to
provide for a small but efficient federal government.
   Pre-election surveys indicate the Communists _ now called the
Party for Democratic Change _ are leading, with the Union in second
place and the Coalition trailing third.
   The polls show, however, one-third of Croatia's 3.5 million
registered voters are still undecided.
   Two other Yugoslav republics, Bosnia and Macedonia, have
legalized opposition parties and are expected to schedule free
elections soon.
   But in Serbia and Montenegro, the smallest republic, the ruling
Communists have yet to legalize independent parties. Both still
follow a one-party system and there is a strong Communist influence
in the press, judiciary and other aspects of life.
   Polls there open in Slovenia at 7 a.m. and close at 7 p.m. In
Croatia, polls are also open for 12 hours, starting at 8 a.m. First
results in both republics are expected around midnight.

   A woman pleaded guilty to killing her
infant son by feeding him sulfuric acid and will testify that the
boy's father planned the poisoning to collect damages from a
baby-formula maker, prosecutors said.
   Sheila Smith, 27, said ``guilty'' in a soft voice Friday in
making her plea to a first-degree murder charge in a convoluted
case that has gone before the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Smith and Ricky Irby Sr., 29, were charged with murder in the
death of their son Quinten Irby. Irby's trial is scheduled to begin
April 30.
   Quinten was 3 months old when he was poisoned in May 1984. He
lingered in a hospital for more than two years before dying Aug.
26, 1986, at the age of 2{.
   During Friday's hearing, Lake County prosecutor Matthew Chancey
said Smith will testify that Irby told her on May 30, 1984, ``that
he had a way to make some money, but it would involve hurting
Quinten.''
   At the time, Smith was on public aid, living with her parents in
the town of North Chicago, and Irby was an unemployed auto worker.
   Later that evening, Chancey continued, ``Ricky Irby told Smith
that he had messed with the milk. He mentioned acid.'' The next
day, Quinten was hospitalized, and Irby produced an open can of
formula and a bottle that proved to be tainted with sulfuric acid.
   Quinten's burns scarred his mouth and trachea. He had one lung
removed, and remained on a respirator, apparently comatose, until
his death 27 months later. Ingestion of sufuric acid was ruled to
be the cause.
   After the boy died, Irby sued a baby formula manufacturer, but
the suit was withdrawn before it went to trial.
   Under her plea bargain, Smith will escape a possible death
penalty but could get up to 65 years in prison. Her sentencing is
scheduled for June 29.
   A dispute over the handling of evidence in the case at one point
led to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   The evidence was tested by toxicologist Joerg Pirl at a state
crime laboratory in Chicago. But it and Pirl's case file were
discovered missing in January 1985, well before the child died.
   At one point, Pirl underwent hypnosis in an effort to find the
evidence, but the hypnotist later died, and Pirl could not recall
what he had told the man, said Laureen Cahill Casey, a Lake County
public defender representing Smith.
   Investigators later determined that the evidence had been
destroyed accidentally by a lab clerical worker, and with no
evidence, the case essentially was closed, Chancey said.
   It was reopened after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in November
1988 that said evidence lost by accident does not preclude
prosecution. Smith and Irby were charged with murdering their son
in an indictment returned May 31, 1989.
   Both parents have been held on $1 million bail.
   The couple's older son, Ricky Irby Jr., 9, lives with Smith's
mother.

   A Boy Scout leader has been charged with 126
counts of sodomy, accused of having sex with members of his Scout
troop at a summer camp during a three-year period, authorities said.
   Guy Sparks, 31, of Elmira was arraigned Friday in Lodi Town
Court. Justice Howard Cunningham adjourned the case pending Seneca
County grand jury action.
   Investigators said Sparks had sex with members of Boy Scout
Troop 20 from Chemung County during summer trips to Camp Seneca in
Lodi, about 40 miles southwest of Syracuse. The incidents took
place from 1985 to 1988, police said.
   Sparks has been held in Chemung County jail on $10,000 bail
since March 17, when he was charged with one sodomy count.
   Police say they are investigating further allegations that
Sparks sexually abused Scouts during campouts in his Elmira back
yard and at a camp in neighboring Schuyler County.
   Sparks was returned to Chemung County jail Friday after his
arraignment.
   In Seneca County, Sparks faces 54 counts of second-degree sodomy
and 72 counts of third-degree sodomy. An adult is charged with
second-degree sodomy for having sex with children under 14.
Third-degree sodomy involves having sex with children under 17.

   An estimated 200 million people in villages, cities and state
capitals in the United States and in 135 countries will wave the
green flag for planet Earth on Sunday to celebrate the 20th
anniversary of the first Earth Day.
   At last count, demonstrations, parades, concerts and festivals
were planned in some 3,600 American communities, said Earth Day
1990, a coalition of groups helping to coordinate activities.
   ``Earth Day 1990's campaign clearly has struck a nerve in the
American public and in people around the world,'' Denis Hayes, the
group's chairman, said in a statement. ``People are tired of the
failure of leadership from elected officials and corporate policy
makers on environmental issues.''
   Many countries celebrate the planet on June 5, the World
Environment Day instituted by the United Nations, but many others
have jumped on the Earth Day bandwagon.
   Some 10,000 South Koreans are expected to attend a rally Sunday
called ``Korea Earth Day '90'' in central Seoul; in Japan, a
festival will be held on a Tokyo Bay island built with landfill
consisting mostly of the city's garbage.
   In Ireland, the group Earthwatch kicks off a week of events
Sunday, including a children's parade through 11 Irish towns and a
festival at Dublin's St. Stephen's Green park called ``Green on the
Green.'' In Britain, activities range from a marathon to benefit
rain forest preservation to an effort by mountain climbers to clear
up debris left by previous climbers.
   Kuwait marks Earth Day as host to the Regional Organization for
Protection of the Maritime Environment, a group of eight
oil-producing countries.
   Czechoslovakia's events include a relay race Sunday that
culminating atop Mount of St. Catherine near the East German
border. President Vaclav Havel will symbolically plant a tree on
Earth Day at the presidential estate in Lany.
   In the United States, polls have shown repeatedly that Americans
say they will make sacrifices for a cleaner environment.
   More than eight in 10 Americans say they will separate their
trash for recycling, give up plastic fast-food containers and
needless packaging materials, and get their cars inspected annually
to cut emissions, according to one of the latest surveys, a Wall
Street Journal-NBC News poll released Friday.
   More than two-thirds of the respondents said they would pay up
to $600 more for a less polluting car.
   That reflects a sharp change from a decade ago. In 1981, only 51
percent of those polled said that protecting the environment was
more important than keeping prices down. Now 80 percent say they
favor environmental protection over cost savings.
   The Earth Day celebrations will be as diverse as the groups
sponsoring them. In Richmond, Va., four tons of household garbage
will be dumped on a park lawn to provide a hands-on lesson in
recycling.
   Students from the University of New Orleans will hold a jazz
funeral for heavily polluted Lake Ponchartrain.
   In Georgia, prisoners planted more than 100,000 trees and shrubs
in anticipation of Earth Day, and work began on a 110-mile canoe
trail through Georgia's coastal marshes.
   ``We want this Earth Day to have an emphasis on things that will
last,'' said Robert Kerr, senior vice president of the Georgia
Conservancy.
   In New York City, a model of the Earth will rise where the ball
usually falls on New Year's Eve to symbolize the beginning of the
decade of the environment. A concert in Central Park will feature
Hall and Oates, the B-52s, Carly Simon, Edie Brickel and others.
   Tom Cruise will be host of a gathering of politicians,
conservationists and entertainers on Capitol Hill in Washington,
D.C. Jane Alexander, Kevin Bacon, Bruce Hornsby, Branford Marsalis
and Olivia Newton-John are among the celebrities who will be on
hand.
   At 6 a.m., activists will hold a candlelight Mass wearing black
shrouds and death masks outside the Y-12 nuclear weapons plant at
Oak Ridge, Tenn., west of Knoxville. The point is to symbolize the
destructiveness of war and the waste of resources that might
otherwise be devoted to repairing the environment, organizers said.
   Earth Day's organizers hope it will kick off a new decade of
environmental awareness, much as the original Earth Day in 1970
launched a decade that saw the creation of the Environmental
Protection Agency and the passage of landmark environmental
legislation.
   ``Earth Day 1990 must do the same _ promote enactment of a new,
truly clean air act, accelerate a worldwide ban on CFCs
(chlorofluorcarbons), encourage community groups to work with
neighboring industry to prevent adverse health effects from
industrial emissions, and involve individuals in the effort to
improve the state of the environment,'' said Hayes.
   The government also must reduce dependence on fossil fuels by
creating incentives for conservation and energy efficiency and by
promoting research on alternative energy sources, he said.
   The initial Earth Day was conceived by Gaylord Nelson of The
Wilderness Society, then a senator from Wisconsin, as an
``environmental teach-in'' modeled after the anti-Vietnam-war
teach-ins of that era.
   On Friday, Nelson called on students at Indiana University to
form a ``conservation generation.''
   ``I don't want to have to come limping back here 20 years from
now,'' said Nelson, 74, ``and have the embarrassing responsibility
of telling your sons and daughters that you didn't do your duty.''

   The British government says it's a gun, but
speculation rages about Iraq's purpose in ordering eight massive
steel tubes that were seized by British customs officers.
   Whatever device the tubes may have been for, it would be the
world's largest: perhaps a cannon, a rocket launcher, an update of
Germany's V-4 gun, an experiment, or just something to show off,
various experts have suggested.
   The hypothetical weapon has also been described as too long, too
flimsy and too vulnerable for a workable gun.
   ``I wouldn't say a gun, I think a launch system is the right
thing to say,'' Christopher Foss, editor of Jane's Armor and
Artillery, said in an interview Friday. ``I think the actual
military mission is still hard to define.''
   Customs officers seized the tubes, with an overall length of 131
feet, on April 12 in Middlesbrough. The manufacturer, Sheffield
Forgemasters, and the Iraqi government insisted the tubes fit into
a petrochemical plant.
   Iraq claims it is the target of a smear campaign orchestrated by
Britain and Israel since last month's execution of a London-based
journalist in Baghdad. Iraq had accused the Iranian-born man of
being a spy.
   Other suspected weapons parts shipped from Britain to Iraq were
intercepted Friday by customs officers in Greece and Turkey.
   Britain banned weapons shipments to Iran and Iraq when the two
countries were at war and the ban remains in effect.
   Iraq has been aggressively developing weapons, including the new
al-Abbas missile with a reported range of 560 miles, and a 210mm
self-propelled gun unveiled last year.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has said his arsenal includes
chemical weapons. Iraq is also thought to be attempting to develop
atomic weapons.
   The tubes seized on the dock in Middlesbrough were unlike any
artillery now in use. The barrel was in eight pieces, not one, and
had a smooth bore, devoid of the spiral rifling that is standard in
artillery.
   ``There is no question it could be used as a barrel of a large
artillery gun to fire a projectile of some considerable size,''
said Douglas Tweddle, chief customs investigator.
   But the bore, reported by customs officers to be 1000 mm, was
nearly five times wider than the 203 mm self-propelled howitzers
that are the largest in the U.S. and Soviet arsenals.
   Sheffield Forgemasters acknowledged that Space Research Corp. of
Brussels, founded by cannon builder Gerald Bull, was involved in
the project.
   The government says the tubes correspond to a Bull design, based
on guns he helped build for the U.S.-Canadian High Altitude
Research Project in the 1960s. The so-called HARP gun theoretically
could fire a rocket-boosted shell 1,150 miles, the British journal
Defense reported.
   Bull later founded Space Research in Vermont. He served a brief
jail term in 1980 for violating the U.S. arms embargo against South
Africa.
   Bull was found shot dead outside his apartment in Brussels on
March 22.
   Robert Turp, a British ballistics consultant, said Bull would
``work for literally anyone who would give him the money and
facilities to play with designs for big guns.''
   At various times, Bull's clients reportedly included Israel and
China as well as South Africa and Iraq.
   Defense reported in February that Iraq had shown interest in a
gun, based on the HARP designs, ``capable of firing satellites or
weapons into low earth orbit.''
   Defense asked Bull's son, Michel, whether Space Research was
involved. ``I cannot confirm this or discuss it,'' Bull was quoted
as saying, but he confirmed Space Research had ``very close
contacts in Iraq'' including military contracts.
   If the tubes seized in Britain were used as a conventional gun
with a single explosive charge, ``it would blow itself to pieces,''
said Phillip Wright, chief executive of Sheffield Forgemasters.
   But experts say there are other ways to accelerate a projectile,
and some have pointed to the German V-4 built in World War II.
   The V-4, according to the Imperial War Museum, was a 150mm gun
built in 40 sections totaling 492 feet. The V-4 had 28 powder
chambers that fired in rapid sequence as the projectile moved up
the barrel.
   Built near Calais on the French side of the English Channel, the
V-4 was bombed by the Royal Air Force before it could fire any of
its 150-pound projectiles at London.
   The Independent, citing unidentified sources in Space Resaerch,
said Forgemasters built parts for two barrels, each 492 feet long
in 26 sections. Forgemasters has acknowledged shipping 44 pieces of
tubing before the eight were seized.

   This year is off to the second warmest start
on record, the federal Climate Analysis Center reports.
   Only 1921 was warmer during the first three months of the year,
according to climate records going back to 1895.
   The nation's average temperature in March was just over 45
degrees Fahrenheit, making it the 10th warmest March on record, the
center noted.
   That followed the nation's warmest January on record, with an
average temperature of about 37 degrees, and the 15th warmest
February, when temperatures averaged just above 37 degrees.
   The hot first quarter contrasts sharply with 1989, which went
out with the 4th coldest December on record. Overall, 1989 was
somewhat cooler than average in the United States.
   January's warm weather has been attributed to strong westerly
winds that carried abundant moisture ashore in the Northwest and
blocked cold air from moving south out of Canada during the month.
That blocking prevented normal cold from developing and led to the
record warm month.
   The first half of February was a continuation of January's
weather pattern, but by mid-month weather began to look more
normal, with severe outbreaks developing.
   March is usually a month of contrasts and this year was no
exception. But a strong high pressure area kept the East warm early
in the month before weakening and giving way to cool, damp weather
at the end of the month. In mid-month, however, cold weather in the
West was replaced by mild air moving inland from the Pacific Ocean.

   A wedding for ``Junior'' Gotti on Saturday? Hey,
forget about it.
   The 26-year-old son of reputed mob boss John Gotti wasn't seen
tying the knot at his neighborhood church Saturday afternoon, but
that didn't stop assorted reporters and shutterbugs from staking
out the building in anticipation of the rumored nuptials.
   The elder Gotti, who's used to the intense scrutiny of federal
agents, was shadowed instead by local media types desperately
seeking bridesmaids. But the press found no sign of the bride's
family or the Gambino ``family'' at the Queens church.
   In fact, the only wedding Saturday at Our Lady of Grace Roman
Catholic Church in Howard Beach featured two people whose phones
were never even wiretapped (probably).
   Rumors were rampant last week that John A. ``Junior'' Gotti,
whose dad is the reputed head of the nation's most powerful crime
family, would be walking down the aisle Saturday with Kim Albanese.
``Married to the Mob,'' the tabloids yelled. The two have
reportedly been dating for three years.
   Junior himself dismissed the reports.
   ``I don't know what you're talking about,'' he told the Daily
News. ``You guys believe everything you hear?''
   His dad, the ``Dapper Don,'' wasn't wearing a tux Saturday
afternoon when he slipped out the back door of his Queens home and
zipped over to his local hangout, the Bergin Hunt and Fish Club.
   If there was a wedding Saturday, the reception _ allegedly _ was
to take place at the posh Helmsley Palace in Manhattan. A large
Italian flag fluttering outside the building was the only thing
even hinting at a bash for Junior.
   Law enforcement officials say that the younger Gotti followed
his father in the Gambino family business last year. He is said to
be president of a Brooklyn trucking company and he has been
arrested several times in bar fights.

<HEAD>European Community Asks Soviets to End Blockade of Lithuania</HEAD>

   The European Community on Saturday called
on Moscow to lift its expanding embargo on natural gas, oil and
other shipments to Lithuania, denouncing the action as coercive.
   Foreign ministers attending the 12-nation meeting in Dublin
urged immediate talks to end the crisis.
   However, wary of destabilizing Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, the foreign ministers made no move to take action
against Moscow and ignored a plea by the Baltic republic for full
recognition as an independent state.
   Moscow has cut all oil and more than 80 percent of Lithuania's
natural gas supply to get the republic to rescind its March 11
declaration of independence. Food and raw materials from Soviet
sources were also being curtailed.
   The community nations ``believe measures of a coercive nature
can make no contribution to the search for a solution through
dialogue,'' the foreign ministers said in a joint declaration.
   Expressing grave concern, the community statement called for
``maximum restraint'' and said ``an outcome acceptable to all ...
is possible only by means of discussion.''
   It said the foreign ministers ``call on all concerned not to
carry through measures which are inconsistent with this objective.''
   Irish officials said the Irish ambassador to Moscow, Patrick
McCabe, will present the European Community's demand for a lifting
of the Lithuanian blockade to the Kremlin.
   The foreign ministers said they would meet again soon to review
the situation, but gave no date. They also made no hint of plans to
take action against the Soviet Union.
   Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene had sent a
message to the meeting calling on the European Community to
recognize the independence of Lithuania.
   ``By recognizing Lithuania now, the EC can protest the Soviet
Union's obstacles to normal trade relations, not only between us
and the Soviet Union, but also between us and the rest of the
world,'' Mrs. Prunskiene said.
   ``Other countries shouldn't leave us alone to solve this
problem,'' she said in Copenhagen.
   Danish Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, who met Mrs.
Prunskiene in Copenhagen earlier Saturday, relayed her appeal to
the Western alliance.
   A spokesman for the Irish government, which holds the current
presidency of the community, said the ministers' reply ``is
appropriate.''
   ``It is not just important for the European Community to
maintain good relations with the Soviet government,'' said the
spokesman, speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity.
   ``It is important from Lithuania's own point of view that
Gorbachev is not undermined.''
   The Irish spokesman stressed the community was not calling on
Lithuania to retract its declaration of independence.
   The one-day foreign ministers' meeting was called to prepare for
a special European Community summit April 28 on incorporating East
Germany into the Western trade bloc and a call by some members for
political and economic union of the community by 1993.
   Ireland included Lithuania in the agenda at the last minute,
marking the community's first move on Lithuania since Moscow began
the blockade this week.

   Mutiny is stirring in Cumberland County
among Republicans saddled by a chairman who broke the commandment:
Thou shalt not criticize a party candidate.
   To make matters worse, Paul A. Volle was arrested on a $21.21
shoplifting charge but still refuses to step down as party chairman.
   GOP regulars called a special meeting Wednesday, with an eye to
removing Volle before the state convention Friday, the same day
he's to be arraigned in district court on the charge of stealing
batteries and microcassettes from a supermarket.
   But no one is confident enough to predict victory against the
conservative forces of Volle, a supporter of former television
evangelist and presidential candidate Pat Robertson.
   Volle first angered his fellow partisans in January by saying
Republican congressional candidate David Emery, a former U.S.
representative who lost a 1982 Senate race to Sen. George J.
Mitchell, should abandon his candidacy for the good of the party
after flip-flopping from an anti-abortion position to pro-choice.
   Volle ``called a press conference and implied it was him
speaking as the chairman of the Republican Central Committee,''
said Everett Giles, a former county GOP chairman. Many Republicans
were outraged by that violation of the party's so-called 11th
Commandment, which prohibits Republicans from running down
Republicans.
   ``You don't speak evil of other Republicans,'' Giles said.
   Then, when Volle was arrested March 20 and charged with
shoplifting, party regulars and state GOP Chairman Phil Jackson
assumed Volle would step down.
   They were wrong.
   At an April 11 meeting called to determine Volle's status as
chairman, he adamantly refused to quit.
   ``I have been asked to resign,'' Volle said. ``I refuse to do
so.''
   When Republican regulars moved to oust the chairman, Volle
called the motion out of order. Volle's opponents admit they were
outmaneuvered through Volle's superior use of the party bylaws.
   ``When you go to the ball, you'd better have your dancing shoes,
and we didn't,'' said Tony Payne, a former Republican chairman for
Portland. Cumberland County includes Portland and surrounding areas.
   ``We've had some difficulties in the process because Paul has
used the procedures to shield himself from the debate,'' Payne
said. ``He ruled that the motion that had been made was out of
order. He made a number of arbitrary rulings. As chairman, he has
that prerogative. We don't know what the dickens is going to
transpire.''
   They need a two-thirds vote by county party committee members to
oust Volle at Wednesday's meeting.
   Part of Volle's power base includes his wife, Carolyn, the
county party's secretary, who is accused by Volle's foes of
withholding information on who the committee members are and which
ones may vote in the special meeting.
   Neither Volle nor Mrs. Volle has returned several messages left
on their telephone answering machine.
   But Volle's supporters note that he has not been proven guilty
of anything.
   ``I guess the question is, `Why should he step down?''' said
Carolyn Cosby, chairman of the Portland city GOP. ``He claims he is
innocent, and I believe him. I think this has turned into some kind
of a witchhunt.''
   ``I have had a number of harassing phone calls since this has
taken place,'' she said Saturday. ``Those people who are Paul
Volle's supporters are being bothered.''
   Volle has worked tirelessly for the party and helped form a
strong slate of candidates for the November elections, she said.
   But Giles expressed concerns that if Volle survives the meeting
Wednesday and appears at the state convention, he will become even
further entrenched.
   At the 1988 state convention, Volle and other Robertson
supporters tried to drag out a debate on an anti-abortion amendment
but were muzzled by party regulars.
   Payne said Volle was able to gain power in the local party
following the 1988 presidential election, when Payne led the local
Republicans who favored George Bush and Volle led the backers of
Robertson.
   Many party regulars backed Volle in an unsuccessful run for the
state House.
   ``My concern at this juncture is that Paul's methodic wresting
of power from mainstream Republicans has resulted in a party of
Volle's group that is not inclusive,'' Payne said. ``It's a case of
one guy who refuses to budge. It's an aberration of one
personality.''

   Derek Chung is a Spam fan with a mission _ to
enlighten college students about ``this brick of pink meat.''
   ``I just put up posters to get people here to eat more Spam,''
said Chung, a senior at Carnegie-Mellon University.
   ``I can never tell whether people will want to come over and
actually eat the stuff.''
   Chung spent Saturday trying to coerce 50 or so fellow students
to sample the culinary delights of Spam at Spamfest VI, his sixth
free love feast of canned luncheon meat, soda pop and Twinkies.
   Billed as the ``premier pork event of Carnegie Mellon,'' the
minifestival at Chung's off-campus apartment draws the curious, the
doubters and the determined.
   ``We don't sit around and eat Spam normally,'' said senior
Barbara McQuain, 21, of Elkins, W.Va. ``But Derek makes things out
of Spam that you wouldn't believe.''
   There's Spam pizza, Spamwiches, macaroni and Spam, and the main
staple, Spam and eggs.
   Chung said the all-time favorite is Spam Polynesian, in which
the meat is sliced up, mixed with pineapple and served in a
pineapple shell topped with apricot preserves ``to cover up some of
the Spam flavor.''
   ``Spam partially fills you up and partially you just don't want
to eat much of it,'' said Chung, 20, of Dublin, Ohio.
   Bob Patterson, vice president at Geo. A. Hormel &amp; Co. in Austin,
Minn., said the company is used to jokes aimed at its most famous
product, which was introduced in 1937 and was a staple of GIs
during World War II.
   ``Even back in the early days people would joke about it as a
ham that didn't pass its physical,'' he said.
   ``But you've got to laugh at yourself once in while.''
   Chung has extolled the versatility of Spam since his freshman
year, when he began serving it as a snack to members of his study
group. He has held Spamfests twice a year since, but skipped last
fall's fest because consumption had tapered off.
   ``I figured if I skipped one, people would be hungry enough to
eat more next time,'' he said. ``I don't want leftovers.''

   The proprietor of Aaron's Bait and Tackle
has his window display set for the opening of the trout season, and
he figures he has the competition beat this time.
   Aaron Weinberg is a veteran in business, after all _ even though
he's only 10.
   He set up shop last fall with a small assortment of fishing gear
at Northwest Auto Clinic, operated by his stepfather, Pat Osmon.
   ``I was open but not stable,'' Aaron recalled. ``Then nobody
came in because they didn't know I was open.''
   This time, he has a pink wooden fish twice as big as he is
outside the shop, and Osmon has invested $3,500 in stock. Aaron
said half the proceeds would go back into the business, a quarter
into his pocket and a quarter into his college savings fund.
   He said he checked a local sporting goods store and a pharmacy
that sells fishing tackle and found his own prices were lower. In
addition, he said, he can offer advice on gear and lakes in the
area.
   The state's lowland lakes fishing season opens Sunday.
   Howard Weinberg, the boy's father, said he began taking his son
fishing more than six years ago. Last year, the youngster landed a
20-pound salmon on 10-pound test line.
   ``Whenever we go fishing, he always catches more,'' Weinberg
said. ``He thinks like a fish. He knows where they're going to be.''

<HEAD>Family: In Lieu of Flowers, Abstain An Hour From Alcohol</HEAD>

   The funeral director hestitated when he
read the obituary Sally Clausen wrote for her husband: ``In lieu of
flowers, his family requests one hour of abstinence of alcohol and
smoking in his memory.''
   Mrs. Clausen said she wrote the notice to help her husband of
nearly 30 years send a message in death that he couldn't articulate
in life. Donald J. Clausen, 60, died Friday, two days after
collapsing of a heart attack at a Madison hospita .
   ``Donald was an abusive beer drinker and cigarette smoker, which
resulted in his death. He was an alcoholic,'' Mrs. Clausen wrote.
   While her husband was dying, Mrs. Clausen said she lay in bed
wondering what she could say about him. She said it dawned on her
that she should tell the truth about a lifestyle that killed him.
   She telephoned her four children, who approved of the obituary
and the message that smoking and alcohol abuse can kill, Mrs.
Clausen said.
   Clausen, who began smoking when he was 13 years old, suffered
from emphysema, she said.
   ``He was very often drunk,'' Mrs. Clausen said. ``Everybody knew
what he was. He knew he was like that but couldn't change. He
didn't want his children to be like that. He didn't have the
know-how to send this message.''
   Mrs. Clausen said she knows the obituary will catch people off
guard, including funeral home director William O'Rourke, who read
the message and asked if she was sure that was what she wanted to
say.
   Although it was difficult, Mrs. Clausen said she did not waver
in her decision. ``Maybe if we talk about this, more people will
think about what they are doing,'' she said.

   Flags were lowered and cafes and restaurants
closed their doors late Saturday as Israelis began marking the most
tragic event in Jewish history _ the loss of 6 million lives at the
hands of the Nazis in World War II.
   Holocaust Day comes on the 27th day of the Hebrew lunar month of
Nisan _ the timing set by Parliament to fall between the
anniversary of the 1943 Warsaw Jewish Ghetto uprising against the
Nazis and Israel's Independence Day.
   A 1961 law orders all places of entertainment shut for the
holiday, which begins at sundown Saturday and ends 24 hours later.
   Some of the 300,000 Israelis who survived the Holocaust are now
leading the nation. The family of Polish-born Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir was killed by the Nazis.
   The 800,000 children of victims have been named a ``second
generation of victims.''
   Although the shadow of the Holocaust still hovers over lives and
deeply influences Israeli politics, its impact is diminishing. The
annual 24-hour memorial is intended to remind them of the Jewish
loss.
   ``Our generation ... is not free from prejudice and evil,''
Shamir told a solemn gathering of survivors and soldiers at
Jerusalem's Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial Saturday.
   ``Manifestations of anti-Semitism throughout the world use the
winds of freedom to carry their lying voices ... history must not
be forgotten.''
   Concentration camp survivors and former Jewish fighters in the
allied armies of World War II then lit six torches.
   As they did last year, hundreds of Israeli children and soldiers
will recite lists of victims' names and ages at ceremonies across
the country. The main opening ceremony for the name-reading will be
held Sunday at Israel's Knesset, or parliament.
   Near Tel Aviv's Culture Hall, dozens of people stood in line and
read names of slain relatives from a podium.
   ``My father Yisrael, my mother Ethel, my four brothers _ Mendel,
Yehiel, Yosef and Baruch, and my two sisters,'' a small, elderly
woman recited.
   Although Israel is preoccupied with its political crisis,
weekend newspaper editions devoted much of their space to Holocaust
stories and some interviewed Germans living in Israel.
   Rock music and newsreels were gradually replaced by solemn tunes
and interviews with survivors in radio broadcasts.
   This year, Holocaust Day carries a unique meaning for Israel
because of renewed ties with Eastern Europe. The Jewish state hopes
that the warming in relations will enable it to gather new
information on the Holocaust and reveal new names of Nazi war
criminals.
   Some new names were found this year, like those of 223
Lithuanian and Polish war crime suspects who fled abroad after the
war. Nazi-hunting groups plan to turn these names over to the
United States, West Germany and Australia.
   The focus of Holocaust remembrance this year shifted to Poland,
where some 4,000 Jewish teen-agers, including about 1,000 Israelis,
are to conduct a one-mile ``March of the Living'' from Auschwitz to
the Birkenau death camp. The march was to be broadcast live on
Israeli television and radio.
   Earlier this week, the youths visited other death camp sites in
Poland, where millions of Jews were killed in the Holocaust.
   Another Eastern European country, East Germany, this month made
a major gesture of reconciliation gesture when its new, freely
elected parliament apologized for the atrocities of the Nazi
Holocaust. Israel had not maintained diplomatic ties with East
Germany because that country's former Communist government refused
to offer an apology.

   Pope John Paul II and President
Vaclav Havel on Saturday celebrated Czechoslovakia's peaceful
revolution that toppled the Communists, portraying it as a victory
over spiritual darkness.
   Hundreds of thousands of faithful welcomed the Polish-born
pontiff as he made his first visit to Eastern Europe since a
pro-democracy tide ousted the region's hard-line Communist leaders
last year.
   ``It is the first time I have seen so many believers around me,
people who do not fear to show their faith,'' said 25-year-old
Martin, a Franciscan studying for the priesthood in the Moravian
city of Brno.
   The Roman Catholic leader's two-day trip, which includes stops
in Velehrad and Bratislava on Sunday, was hastily arranged at
Havel's request to allow John Paul to lend his support to
democratic change. The pontiff was last in Eastern Europe in June
1987, when he visited Poland.
   In a prelude to the trip, the Vatican and Czechoslovakia
restored diplomatic relations Thursday after a 40-year
interruption. As barriers have fallen throughout Eastern Europe,
the Vatican has moved quickly to forge ties with countries with
centuries of Christian tradition.
   ``I daresay ... I am participating in a miracle,'' said Havel, a
nominal Catholic who only last year was jailed by the hard-line
Czechoslovak regime for his dissident activities.
   ``The messenger of love comes into a country devastated by the
ideology of hatred; the living symbol of civilization comes into a
country devastated by the rule of the uncivilized,'' he said.
   John Paul, speaking of the entire region, said communism had
proved itself to be a ``tragic utopia'' because it denied the
spiritual needs of man.
   He assailed what he called the ``violent application of a
materialistic ideology'' that had paralyzed the nations of Eastern
Europe.
   Huge crowds standing eight deep waited during sporadic
thunderstorms to watch the pope's motorcade pass through the narrow
cobblestoned streets leading to the spired gothic cathedral and
Hradcany Castle, the presidential residence.
   An open-air Mass on the Letna Plain, for decades the site of
staged Communist Party extravaganzas, drew an estimated half
million people, including many from neighboring Poland waving
Solidarity banners. The crowd stayed despite a raging 10-minute
cloudburst and intermittent rain throughout the two-hour service.
   Nevertheless, the mood of the throng was cheerful for what was
believed to be the biggest Mass in Czechoslovakia since before
World War II.
   The pope turns 70 next month and who was making the 46th foreign
pilgrimage of his pontificate.
   Referring to the country's former rulers, he said at the Mass,
``The ones who feared truth and freedom feared Christ.''
   He urged Czechs and Slovaks to guard against divisive
nationalist tensions. ``Now you have to unite and together step out
into the future,'' he said.
   The papal speeches were filled with praise and encouragement for
the Czechoslovak church and its 90-year-old leader Frantisek
Tomasek, for whom the visit is a vindication of decades of
resistance to Communist pressures.
   The church in Czechoslovakia suffered greater repression than
anywhere in the Soviet bloc and up to 10 of its 13 dioceses have
remained vacant for years.
   In a meeting with members of the clergy, John Paul told them he
was paying tribute ``to all your suffering, to listen to you, to
ackowledge publicly the value of the witnesses of your church, and
to thank you for it.''
   He cautioned them however against what he called ``viruses''
from the West, listing secularism, ``hedonistic consumerism'' and
atheism.
   In the evening, the pope was scheduled to meet with Havel at
Hradcany Castle and then deliver an address.
   On Sunday, he was to travel to Velehrad and Bratislava. In
Velehrad, 1985 celebrations were held to honor saints Cyril and
Methodius, who helped spread Christianity in the Slavic world.
   John Paul often deplored the state of the church in the East
bloc and urged Roman Catholics in Czechoslovakia to remain firm in
their faith.
   But soon after the regime led by Milos Jakes was toppled by
Czechoslovakia's peaceful revolution last year, restrictions on the
church were lifted and long-vacant bishops' posts were filled.
   Statistics released by the Vatican estimate 10.7 million
Catholics live in Czechoslovakia, out of a population of 15.6
million.

   Two weeks after a failed launch
attempt, an improved Discovery is ready to embark on one of the
most momentous shuttle missions, hoisting the Hubble Space
Telescope high enough to behold the threshold of time.
   The countdown began Saturday afternoon for a launch set for 8:31
a.m. EDT Tuesday. If the launch goes on schedule and all else goes
well, the first picture from Hubble could be available next weekend.
   ``We are as excited, maybe even more. You can cut it with a
knife, incredible,'' said Eric Chaisson, senior scientist at the
Space Telescope Science Institute at Johns Hopkins University in
Baltimore.
   Nothing, at least scientifically, seems to have been lost as a
result of the two-week wait, one of numerous delays plaguing the
mission since its original 1983 launch date.
   As Chaisson remarked last week: ``The universe has been around
for 15 billion years. A couple of weeks is not going to matter.''
   ``The heavens look the same to me. The secrets are the same,''
Chaisson said.
   ``There's not a bit of difference,'' agreed Charles Pellerin
Jr., NASA's director of astrophysics. ``I think the main point is
the Hubble Space Telescope still is in perfect condition.''
   The $1.5 billion telescope, the most expensive unmanned
spacecraft ever built, rests safely inside Discovery's payload bay
awaiting the Tuesday launch.
   If all goes well, Discovery will return to Edwards Air Force
Base, Calif., on Sunday, April 29, with an empty payload bay. NASA
said it may release its first telescope image from Hubble _ of an
open star cluster in the constellation Carina _ as early as that
same day.
   After the early test images are made and other preparatory work
is done, Hubble is expected to start providing significant
scientific data by satellite in a month or two.
   The observatory is considered the greatest advance in astronomy
since Galileo first used a telescope in 1609. It also is considered
by many at NASA to be the most important shuttle mission to date;
it will be the 35th.
   The telescope is named for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble,
who discovered during the 1920s the universe constantly is
expanding. His work gave rise to the theory the universe was
created by a tremendous explosion about 15 billion years ago.
   From its perch far above Earth's obstructing atmosphere, the
telescope will be able to discern objects 50 times fainter and with
10 times greater clarity than the best ground-based observatory.
   Astronomers are counting on Hubble to unravel some of the
mystery surrounding quasars, pulsars and black holes. By studying
stars and galaxies so distant their light has been traveling to
Earth for 14 billion years, they hope to determine the precise
origin of the universe and learn whether other solar systems _ and
life forms _ exist.
   ``If everything goes well, it's going to knock our socks off,''
Chaisson said.
   NASA's sole attempt to launch Discovery was halted four minutes
before liftoff April 10 when one of the shuttle's three auxiliary
power units failed. The 88-pound unit was replaced with a new one,
the first time NASA ever had installed such a unit at the launch
pad.
   The procedure went so smoothly the space agency decided last
week to advance the launch to Tuesday, a day earlier than planned.
   Hubble's six nickel-hydrogen batteries were returned to the
telescope Friday following 130 hours of recharging. The batteries
will power Hubble from the time it is disconnected from Discovery's
power system until its energy-collecting solar panels are deployed
380 miles above Earth, the highest a shuttle has ever gone.
   Astronaut Steven A. Hawley will use the shuttle's mechanical arm
to lift the 24,250-pound telescope into space on the second day of
the mission. The telescope's aperture door will be opened on the
next to allow the first starlight to strike the mirror.
   Mission specialists Bruce McCandless II and Kathryn Sullivan,
veteran spacewalkers, will leave the cabin to assist if necessary.
The shuttle will follow Hubble from 40 miles away in case a problem
develops and the telescope must be retrieved and returned to Earth.
   ``You can never eliminate those oddball quirks of fate or
gremlins that may sneak up on any given day,'' Sullivan said. ``But
those are very remote potentials I really suspect we won't
encounter.''
   In addition to the $1.5 billion cost of the telescope, $500
million has been spent to stockpile spare parts, train astronauts
and develop computer software to operate the instrument. The
European Space Agency contributed $250 million to the Hubble
project and will get to use the telescope 15 percent of the time.

<HEAD>Lithuania Closes Factories to Conserve Fuel, Seeks Compromise</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout with official saying economic blockade is total,

   A top Lithuanian official said Saturday
that Moscow has clamped a full economic blockade on the Baltic
republic and support from the West is crucial.
   Lithuania closed its factories for the day to conserve fuel and
raw materials during the Kremlin embargo, designed to pressure the
republic into rescinding its declaration of independence. Leaders
of the republic said they are seeking a compromise with Moscow but
no firm proposals are under discussion.
   Moscow has cut off all oil and more than 80 percent of
Lithuania's natural gas supply since Wednesday. Officials said
supplies of food products, tires, cable and other goods from Soviet
sources also are being curtailed.
   Deputy Premier Romualdas Ozolas quoted a Soviet Ministry of
Transportation directive as saying that nothing can be transported
to Lithuania by railway. Later, he said the order apparently
included truck traffic as well.
   Ozolas said Moscow's orders to stop land shipments to Lithuania
and its diversion of shiploads of goods bound for the republic
amounted to a full embargo.
   ``I believe a blockade has started, a total blockade,
absolutely,'' he said.
   Some shipments, however, were still reaching Lithuania, he said.
   Moscow also is impounding checks to and from Lithuanian
factories, putting a financial stranglehold on them, Ozolas said.
   Saturday is a normal working day in Lithuania but Ozolas said
the majority of factories were not working.
   ``We decided not to waste our strength while it is not
necessary,'' Ozolas said.
   Traffic on the streets of Vilnius, the capital, was light
Saturday as motorists grappled with a rationing plan that limits
them to about 7 gallons of gasoline a month.
   Ozolas said some factories still open Saturday would probably
have to close down begining Monday because of shortages of fuel and
raw materials. Ozolas said Lithuania would pay unemployment
compensation to workers left unemployed. Lithuania voted March 11
to restore the independence it lost when it was forcibly annexed to
the Soviet Union in 1940.
   Despite military and economic pressure, Lithuanians have refused
to back off their declaration. Ozolas said Saturday that help from
the West was crucial.
   ``We must get support from the West. If there is no alternate
supply from the West, we'll be nothing,'' he said. ``If we don't
find such alternate supplies, we can say our struggle is useless.''
   The neighboring republic of Estonia, also moving toward
independence, has offered aid to Lithuania and an agreement was
expected to be reached late Saturday, Ozolas said. Estonia and
Latvia were also annexed by Moscow in 1940.
   Also Saturday, a delegation from Lithuania arrived in Denmark
for talks on obtaining oil to counteract the Soviet blockade. The
delegation, led by Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene,
met Norwegian oil officials on Friday.
   ``Other countries shouldn't leave us alone to solve this
problem,'' Mrs. Prunskiene said.
   She later appealed to European Community foreign ministers
meeting in Dublin asking that they recognize Lithuania as a
sovereign nation. They ignored her request but called on Moscow to
lift its blockade.
   Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis said Saturday that
``the threat we are facing is very great.''
   Landsbergis told an opening session of a congress of the
pro-independence movement Sajudis that Lithuania was searching for
a compromise with Moscow, but there were no proposals on the table.
   Asked about reports Moscow was offering to negotiate if
Lithuania delayed independence for two years, Landsbergis said:
``We haven't received any kind of proposal. We haven't debated
this.''
   But Landsbergis did say some compromise ``ideas'' have been
raised in contacts with the Kremlin through middlemen. He did not
elaborate.
   In a message to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev late
Friday, Lithuania's Supreme Council said the republic's
independence could not harm the Soviet Union, and again expressed
willingness to negotiate.
   The cable to Gorbachev demanded, however, that Soviet soldiers
who stormed a Communist Party printing plant Friday afternoon and
roughed up civilian guards be punished.
   The Sajudis congress was called to discuss changes in the
2-year-old movement's strategy.
   The Communist Party faction still loyal to the Kremlin opened a
congress of its own in the Lithuanian capital Saturday. The
official Tass news agency said the issue of independence, the
termination of oil supplies and cutback of natural gas would be
discussed by the 800 delegates.
   ``Landsbergis and Prunskiene must resign,'' said an ethnic
Russian worker from the port of Klaipeda who identified himself
only as Alexander.
   ``Landsbergis plays the balalaika well, but as a president, he's
a zero,'' he said of the music professor-turned-politician.
   Communist Party chief Algirdas Brazauskas told Lithuania Friday
that it must compromise on its pro-independence decisions or face
critical shortages of oil and natural gas in two weeks.
   ``The price for independence must have limits,'' Brazauskas told
the Lithuanian parliament.
   The energy embargo has left the republic with only 15 to 17
percent of the 18 million cubic meters of natural gas it uses daily
for homes and industry.
   Lithuania, however, produces more meat and milk than it consumes
and is in no danger of starving.

<HEAD>Rapist Who Threw Victim in Pit Gets 20 Years</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man who pleaded guilty to raping a young
woman he imprisoned in a pit behind his mobile home will be
imprisoned himself for 20 years.
   When William Richard Grau, 48, was sentenced Friday for
kidnapping and six counts of rape, prosecutors told the judge how
he dug the 4-foot-wide, 9-foot-deep pit complete with a small seat,
plexiglass roof and electric fan.
   ``We can only speculate by the way he built it in secret, it was
in contemplation of the act,'' Assistant State Attorney John
Valenti said in outlining the case.
   The 19-year-old victim had lived with Grau and his two teen-age
daughters on and off for nearly six years and even began calling
him ``Dad.'' But nine hours of terror began the night of Jan. 9.
   The woman told Hillsborough County sheriff's deputies that she
was dressing for a date when Grau burst in, wrapped her mouth,
wrists and ankles with duct tape and raped her in a tent pitched in
the back yard.
   After a struggle, he pushed her headfirst into the 9-foot-deep
hole, but ultimately let her out only to rape her three more times.
   ``She stated she kept crying and he was crying and kept telling
her he couldn't believe he was doing this to his baby, but he had
already started and he would finish,'' according to the police
report.
   Grau then let the woman go and told her, ``Do what you have to
do.''
   The retired Air Force technical sergeant who was managing a
shopping mall video arcade had never been arrested before.
   In accordance with his plea agreement, Circuit Judge Susan
Bucklew imposed the 20-year sentence to be followed by 20 years
probation. Upon his release, Grau is to seek treatment as a sex
offender and can have no contact with the victim or anyone under
age 16.

   It was the same street along which
Communist rulers passed on their way into town, but it was a far
different crowd that turned out Saturday to cheer Pope John Paul II.
   During Communist rule, the people of Prague were accustomed to
lining Lenin Street, the long avenue leading from the airport to
the center of town. Throngs of uninterested bystanders, bribed with
an afternoon off work, would show up whenever a head of state came
to town.
   But this time, tens of thousands of people needed no
encouragement as they joyfully waited for hours to glimpse John
Paul. It was his first visit to Eastern Europe since a
pro-democracy tide toppled the region's hard-line Communist leaders
last year.
   ``I was out here only once, when Gagarin was in Prague,'' said
bystander Marie Martincova, referring to astronaut Yuri
Gagarin.``He saw the stars, so I thought that was a good reason to
say hello.''
   She spent the entire morning standing in her Sunday best for the
minute John Paul II would pass by in his white Popemobile, blessing
the crowd.
   A policeman, waiting in a yellow van, declined to give his name
but did not hide his relaxed mood.
   He said the crowd would not be a problem. ``After all, the
people got what they wanted.''
   Eva Hurychova, a 38-year-old bank accountant from Eastern
Bohemia, traveled to Prague on an overnight train wearing a dress
embroidered by her mother for special occasions.
   ``They (Communists) robbed us of 40 years of spiritual life and
our generation should realize it is a great honor to witness this
personally,'' Ms. Hurychova said.
   Street vendors rushed to sell the last color posters of the pope
at a discount price as the motorcade moved toward Prague Castle.
Hawkers sold everything from bananas and Hungarian salami to
pictures of saints.
   Some 5,000 representatives of the country's clergy and
handicapped Czechoslovaks received papal blessings inside the
Gothic St.Vitus Cathedral.
   ``It is the first time I have seen so many believers around me,
people who do not fear to show their faith,'' said 25-year-old
Martin, a Franciscan.
   ``This would not have been possible several months ago,'' he
said.
   Sitting in a wheelchair, Kveta Navratilova said the pope's visit
was an important encouragment to all who want to make sure
Czechoslovakia is not led astray on its journey to freedom.
   ``I hope the pope's visit will help stabilize the country before
elections and unite all democratic forces so that we keep the
Communists away from power for good,'' she added.

<HEAD>Jury May Get Ford Case Early in Week</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The fate of U.S. Rep. Harold Ford likely
will be in a trial jury's hands this week, three years after he was
charged with taking political payoffs from two Tennessee bankers.
   Ford, a Memphis Democrat first elected to Congress in 1974, has
been on trial since Feb. 12 on charges of conspiracy, bank and mail
fraud.
   ``I want to say now that I expect a verdict of acquittal
exonerating me from these charges,'' Ford said Friday after his
lawyers wrapped up their closing arguments to the jury.
   Ford is on trial with three former aides of banker C.H. Butcher
Jr., who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for bank fraud.
   Butcher and his brother, Jake, a two-time candidate for governor
also serving a 20-year bank fraud sentence, once controlled the
largest chain of banks in the state but their financial empire
collapsed in 1983.
   Prosecutors say Ford got more than $1 million in loans from the
Butchers between 1976 and 1982, many of them allegedly intended as
political payoffs he was not expected to repay.
   Ford contends his Butcher loans totaled $650,000 and all of them
have been settled.
   His co-defendants are accountant David Crabtree and lawyers
Douglas Beaty and Karl Schledwitz, who are charged with helping him
get and hide Butcher payoffs.
   The government called 29 witnesses in its case against Ford, and
defense and prosecution lawyers filed more than 170 exhibits for
the jury to review.
   The defense declined to call any witnesses. Ford said he spent
more than 500 hours preparing his trial testimony but decided not
to take the witness stand because he regarded the government's case
as weak.
   Government witnesses outlined a complicated string of loans to
Ford on which few if any payments were made prior to the Butcher
banking collapse.
   ``While the Butchers were in control, he didn't have to repay
anything,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Dan Clancy said in his
summation to the jury.
   In his closing statement, defense attorney William McDaniels
said the government failed to show what services Ford supposedly
supplied in exchange for Butcher payoffs.
   Prosecutors showed that Ford borrowed heavily and bought
expensive home furnishings and a $35,000 car while deep in debt.
They also showed that he supported Jake Butcher politically, but
none of that means he broke the law, McDaniels said.
   ``If you are to remove a political leader for his politics or
his lifestyle, that is to be done at the ballot box, not the jury
box,'' he said.
   Ford, the only black in Tennessee's congressional delegation,
contends the charges against him are the work of racist prosecutors
who dislike him personally. Clancy, who has denied those
allegations, has the opportunity Monday to address the jury for a
final time.

   ``Red Saturday'' was different this year.
   Instead of mouthing the usual praises for Soviet-founder
Vladimir I. Lenin on his birthday, party officials felt compelled
to defend his honor and workers who voluntered for a day's labor
sent their earnings to charity instead of the state budget.
   The April Saturday is a decades-old cross between spring
cleaning and solemn obeisance to the Soviet founder on the eve of
his birthday, which is Sunday.
   Millions of Soviets traditionally spend the day at their
workplaces or tidying up yards and streets under intense social
pressure to ``volunteer'' their labor. TV films, banners and
assemblies mark Lenin's birthday.
   But this year, radical legislators who made major gains in
Soviet regions in recent months have tried to turn the day into
more of an ecological holiday than an ideological day.
   The image of Lenin on his 120th birthday has been severely
tarnished as the Communist Party he founded loses ground in Eastern
Europe and the Soviet Union.
   On Friday night, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev complained of
``slander'' against Lenin in a speech to a holiday gala at the
Bolshoi Theater.
   ``Disrespect for Lenin is unacceptable,'' he told the gathering.
``Slander, immoral and unfounded, ambitious and vulgar in its
essence (is) directed at him as a person. (These are) foolish
attempts to cast doubt on the nobility of his aims and purity of
his thoughts.''
   Gorbachev's remarks and a series of impassioned defenses of
Lenin in the Soviet press this week appeared aimed largely at
parliamentarian Yuri Afanasyev and his backers. Afanasyev, speaking
to the Soviet Congress on March 12 in a session that was later
broadcast nationwide, blamed Lenin for founding a policy of ``state
terror,'' violence and lawlessness.
   Afanasyev shocked and infuriated many, but his remarks were no
more outrageous than other recent published attacks on Lenin. Last
year a Soviet journal reprinted a statement by exiled author
Alexander Solzhenitsyn calling Lenin an ``evil person.''
   There have also been suggestions that Lenin's embalmed body be
removed from its mausoleum on Red Square and given a traditional
burial.
   With the most sacrosanct of Soviet icons under attack, Lenin's
champions have launched a broad defense. This month's edition of
the journal Communist argued that Lenin should not be blamed for
distortions of his thoughts, and proclaimed that ``Lenin needs
protection today.''
   In Arguments and Facts, the country's most popular newspaper,
Lenin's niece argued that ``something should remain holy!'' In that
interview, Olga Ulyanova also objected to vandalism against statues
of Lenin in Eastern Europe.
   This week, deputies of the radical Moscow City Council raised
proposals to remove the giant bust of Lenin from their assembly
hall and to cancel his honorary possession of Deputy's Identity
Card No. 1.
   The Moskovskaya Pravda newspaper condemned the proposals as
``blasphemous'' and lamented: ``It is so much easier to ruin
traditions than to restore them, and we have ruined so many of them
that much is impossible to restore.''
   In Leningrad, where the new city council is also dominated by
radical reformers, deputies refused to pay for celebrations of
Lenin's birthday and declared Saturday an ``ecological subbotnik,''
journalist Maxim Korzhov said.
   Residents of the city of Kiev, said popular movements have also
called for subbotnik money to be spent on ecological measures,
particularly the cleanup of areas contaminated by the 1986
Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident.
   Workers who put in extra hours Saturday insisted on earmarking
the money for special charities, including orphanages and poor
families, the official Soviet news agency Tass reported. Formerly,
earnings from the day were given to the general state budget.

   Space shuttle Columbia's flight
next month to study the cosmos may be overshadowed by the Hubble
Space Telescope's historic journey aboard Discovery, but it will
mark a first for glasnost.
   Columbia's astronauts plan to talk via ham radio to two
cosmonauts aboard the Soviet space station Mir. It's believed that
will be the first time an American and Soviet spacecraft have
exchanged direct radio communication, said Ronald A. Parise, a
payload specialist who came up with the idea.
   Columbia's commander, Vance Brand, said he doesn't know yet what
he will say during the brief conversation. But he imagines it will
be rather ordinary chitchat free of political overtones.
   ``I think basically we'll just say, ``Hi. What are you doing
over there? What sort of experiments are you working now. What do
you expect to learn? How's your food?' '' he said during an
interview Friday at Johnson Space Center.
   Brand wants to converse with the cosmonauts as much as possible
in Russian. He was part of the Apollo-Soyuz mission in 1975 in
which the crews of the American and Soviet spacecraft docked in
space.
   Parise said he believes communications between the crews were
handled through ground controllers on that joint mission.
   Brand is NASA's oldest active astronaut, 2{ weeks shy of his
59th birthday.
   ``I'm going to be prepared to do the best I can in Russian,'' he
said. ``I'll have to drag out some books. I'm pretty rusty.''
   Parise said it's impossible to know when the precedent-setting
conversation will take place during Columbia's nine-day mission
since NASA has not yet announced a new launch date.
   In addition, Mir frequently changes orbits, making it difficult
to know when Columbia's seven astronauts will be able to make
contact with the two cosmonauts who have been on board the station
a few months, Parise said.
   Columbia originally was scheduled to lift off May 9 with a $100
million observatory called Astro that will measure ultraviolet
radiation from stars, galaxies and quasars. But the date was pushed
back at least a week by the delay in getting Discovery off the
ground with the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope, NASA's most
expensive and complex payload that will orbit 380 miles above Earth
for 15 years.
   Discovery is scheduled to lift off Tuesday, two weeks after its
first launch attempt.

<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela was given a spear, a
ceremonial club and the buckskin of a tribal chieftan when he
arrived Saturday in Transkei, the tribal homeland where he was born.
   ``I'm very happy to be home,'' the African National Congress
leader told a crowd of several hundred uniformed ANC marshals at
the airport in Umtata, capital of the homeland that South Africa
declared an independent republic in 1976.
   Mandela received the presents during the airport welcoming
ceremony. He was scheduled to address a rally on Sunday.
   Mandela, 71, said he had fond memories of hunting animals and
swimming in rivers as a boy growing up in the village of Qunu,
which he will visit during his six-day stay in Transkei.
   Mandela is the son of a chief of the royal Tembu clan of the
Xhosa tribe. His father was adviser to the paramount chief and
Mandela was raised as an aristocrat.
   He fled the homeland to avoid an arranged marriage, and became
involved in politics in Johannesburg.
   Mandela, who was freed on Feb. 11 after spending more than 27
years in prison for subversion against the white-minority
government, had not been to his homeland for 30 years. But in
prison, he had many meetings with his relatives.
   He kept in contact with his cousin, Kaiser Matanzima, who became
Transkei's first prime minister in 1976. Matanzima and his brother,
George, lost their power in a series of coups in 1987 which
resulted in a military government run by Maj. Gen. Bantu Holomisa,
the army commander.
   South Africa has 10 tribal homelands, four of them designated as
independent. The ANC and some other black organizations oppose the
homeland system because it deprives the 28-million black majority
of voting, residence, work and land ownership rights in the 87
percent of South Africa that is designated for 5 million whites.
   No foreign countries recognize the homelands as independent
states.
   Mandela's first wife, Evelyn Mase Mandela, his son from that
marriage, Makgatho, and several grandchildren, live in Transkei.
   During the visit, Mandela plans to visit the graves of seven
relatives who died during his imprisonment.

   Jeff Johnson told classmates he was
taking a senior from out of town to the high school prom. He didn't
tell them that ``senior'' was his grandmother.
   All eyes were on Johnson and his grandmother, Julia Burris, 78,
of Park River, when they arrived at the prom with 34 other couples
Friday night. They had a great time _ dining, dancing, and cruising
Main Street in Bismarck about 30 miles away.
   ``It was wonderful,'' Mrs. Burris said Saturday. ``Nobody
fainted when I walked in, and they were all very nice and friendly.
I really enjoyed it.''
   She and her grandson danced the first dance because the music
was slow, she said.
   ``I didn't want to look ridiculous doing a fast one, so we left
right after that,'' she said.
   ``We went to Bismarck for supper and then we cruised Main
Street. We had fun. I didn't feel my age, that's for sure.''
   In Maud, Okla., Eric Bundy went one better and asked his great
grandmother, Nettie Crawford, 77, to go with him to his junior prom
Saturday night.
   ``My great grandpa died in November. She's all alone now. She
doesn't get out much, maybe just to go to Seminole or something.''
Maud is about 15 miles from Seminole and 60 miles southeast of
Oklahoma City.
   Bundy was nervous about telling ``the guys.'' But ``they all
thought it was pretty neat,'' he said. ``Nobody has ever done it
before.''
   Johnson said he decided to ask his grandmother to the prom
because she won't be able to attend his May 20 graduation because
of the graduation the same day of another grandchild.
   ``I was thinking of being a little different,'' he said. ``And
then my grandma's not going to be able to come down for graduation,
so I figured she could come for the prom, the next best thing.''
   Mrs. Burris said at first she thought he was kidding.
   ``Are you sure you want to do that,'' she said she asked several
times. Friends ``gave me a little more courage,'' when they told
her it was an honor to be invited.
   Johnson is president of his school's National Honor Society, a
member of its wrestling and track teams, and plays in the band.
   ``It's really funny how much people assume,'' Johnson said.
   When friends asked whether he and his date had a serious
relationship, he replied:
   ``She's pretty special to me.''

<HEAD>Post-Soccer Match Violence Injures Nearly 50</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto BER1</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of right-wing ``skinheads'' and
leftist extremists went on the rampage in East and West Berlin
after a soccer game, injuring about 50 people, authorities said
Saturday.
   West Berlin police said even worse violence was narrowly avoided
late Friday when hundreds of rowdy soccer fans and neo-Nazi
skinheads were dispersed in East Berlin before a leftist group
arrived from West Berlin to confront them.
   Trouble started after a soccer match in East Berlin when a crowd
of more than 300 youths, some wearing masks, fought each other in
Alexanderplatz, East Berlin's main square.
   Some of the rioters shouted tributes to Adolf Hitler's 101st
birthday, which was Friday, and attacked passersby, police said.
   East Berlin police chief Maj. Dirk Bachmann said that 700 police
were deployed, including 350 in Alexanderplatz, according to the
ADN news agency.
   He was quoted as saying that police action was hindered by the
presence of 3,000 onlookers who refused to move away despite police
appeals.
   Bachmann told ADN that eight people, including four policemen,
were injured in the fracas. Two of the injured were in serious
condition. He said 30 hooligans were arrested.
   ADN said the mob also stormed a homosexual bar, screaming ``Gays
out!'' Amid cries of ``You know it's Adolf Hitler's birthday,''
they smashed windows and ransacked the club.
   Witnesses said some of the club's 15 guests suffered cuts and
bruises in the fray, ADN said without elaborating.
   Police said about 300 West Berlin leftists and foreign residents
gathered on the western side of the Berlin Wall after hearing radio
reports of the violence in East Berlin, then went into East Berlin
to confront the neo-Nazis.
   Since East Germany began dismantling the wall in November after
the hard-line Communist government was toppled, passage between
East and West Berlin has become routine.
   Police said that the leftist group returned to West Berlin
within an hour after they discovered the right-wingers had already
been dispersed.
   ``As they did not meet any right-wing extremists, they came back
to vent their fury here,'' said West Berlin police spokesman Heinz
Wiedemann.
   Wiedemann said the leftist mob hurled stones and bottles at
police, built street barricades and smashed shop and car windows.
He said 41 policemen were injured and 27 people were arrested.
   Wiedemann said at least three stores were looted in West
Berlin's Kreuzberg district. There were no immediate estimates of
the cost of the damage.

   A trash fire on Saturday at Grand Central
Terminal sent smoke billowing into the main concourse and caused
the evacuation of about 500 people, authorities said.
   The blaze began shortly after 10 a.m. under the cement slab of a
platform on the station's upper level, said John Mulligan,
spokesman for the Fire Department. He said the fire was under
control within the hour.
   Homeless people were thought to be responsible for the fire,
which police considered of suspicious origin because there should
not be any debris under the platforms, said Dan Brucker, a
spokesman for the Metro-North Railroad.
   ``Virtually all trash, rubbish fires, not only on the tracks but
in such areas as steam tunnels, have been directly related to the
homeless,'' Brucker said. They either have started the blazes or
sparks from the electrified third rails have set their nests on
fire, he said.
   Mulligan said electrical wiring and other debris was found under
the track.
   Brucker said about 2,000 passengers were delayed for almost an
hour. About 400 passengers were evacuated from four trains, and
another 75 to 100 people were evacuated from nearby platforms or
the main concourse, he said.

<TEXT>
   Lithuania is looking with increasingly
frustration to the West for relief from Soviet embargoes of goods
ranging from oil to fish.
   The West is limiting itself ``to lip service or statements of
hope that the Soviets will start acting better,'' Lithuanian
President Vytautas Landsbergis told reporters Saturday. ``This
could have led Mr. Gorbachev to believe he could do whatever he
wanted.''
   No foreign nations officially recognized the Baltic republic
after it declared its independence March 11.
   Lithuania's leaders continue looking westward for moral support
if not material help as Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev shuts
down fuel supply lines and Lithuanian factories are threatened with
closing.
   On Saturday, Deputy Premier Romualdas Ozolas said Western help
was critical as Moscow appeared to institute a virtual total
blockade on supplies to the Baltic republic. He said a show of
support could help Lithuania's cause by offering a challenge to
Gorbachev.
   ``At least one oil tanker at the Soviet border might change the
blockade situation radically,'' he said.
   But without such help, Lithuania will be ``closed down in a kind
of prison, kept in the cold, suffering from food shortages, and it
will be an interesting picture for the so-called free and
democratic world,'' Landsbergis said.
   Ozolas said Friday the next two to three days would determine
whether Lithuanian hopes pinned on the West were an illusion.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President Bush will
brief Congress next week on possible retaliation for the Kremlin's
economic crackdown. The White House is ``increasingly concerned''
about reports of the economic pressure on Lithuania, Fitzwater said
Friday.
   On Saturday, European Community foreign ministers ignored a
Lithuanian request for oil but urged Gorbachev to call of the
blockade.
   Western diplomats in Moscow have been reserved in their support
of Lithuania. They have limited themselves to warning the Kremlin
that growing cooperation with the West could be damaged if the
Soviet Union continues to opt for confrontation instead of
negotiations.
   One diplomat, who spoke on the condition he remain anonymous,
said a ``major disruption'' in U.S.-Soviet relations could result.
   The United States and most Western governments never recognized
the forcible annexation of Lithuania and its Baltic neighbors,
Latvia and Estonia, by Josef Stalin's army in 1940.
   Lithuanians say for many years afterward they waited for the
West to somehow come to their rescue.
   But it was the political changes unleashed by Gorbachev in his
own country and Eastern Europe that gave Lithuania its chance.
   Lithuania sought official recognition from other countries when
it declared independence. But in the delicate political atmosphere
of improving East-West relations, Landsbergis said Lithuanians
realized it probably would not be forthcoming immediately.
   ``When we started out on this form of struggle for independence,
we did not expect quick help,'' he told the Supreme Council
legislature on Friday. ``We made the decision because it was
necessary, and everything else flows from this.''
   Landsbergis said he did not believe that international trade
union organizations would stand idle if Soviet sanctions throw
thousands of Lithuanians out of work.
   Lithuanian officials acknowledge political recognition or an
economic bailout is no long-term solution to Lithuania's dispute
with the Soviet Union. Ozolas and Deputy Premier Algirdas
Brazauskas, who is also the Communist Party chief, say that the
only long-range solution is a political agreement with Moscow.
   Vitas Batsis, an 18-year-old student, said in an interview that
the West is being too gentle with Gorbachev because it doesn't
understands the Soviet Union.
   ``You have to live here to understand the Russians.''

   Showers and thunderstorms brought locally heavy rains to parts
of West Virginia and Alabama on Saturday, but dry weather prevailed
across much of the rest of the nation.
   Flash flood warnings issued for southern sections of central
West Virginia's Randolph and Tucker counties, where as much as 2{
inches of rain fell. Muscle Shoals, Ala., got more than an inch of
rain.
   Showers and thunderstorms extended from Arkansas to the southern
Appalachians by afternoon, across southern Louisiana, and developed
ahead of a cold front ranging from Virginia and eastern Kentucky to
New England.
   Dry weather prevailed across the rest of the nation, with
sunshine falling on the Great Plains, upper Mississippi Valley and
the upper Great Lakes.
   Temperatures warmed into the 70s in the nation's midsection and
the Southeast, with readings in the 80s in the Dakotas, southern
Texas, southern Louisiana, southern Florida and the desert
Southwest.
   The Northeast had highs in the 50s and 60s, and the northern
Pacific coast reached the 50s at midday.
   Saturday morning's low reading for the Lower 48 was 28 degrees
at Hibbing, Minn., and Sault Ste. Marie, Mich.
   In Barrow, Alaska, participants in the Piuraagiaqta, or spring
festival, were warned to wear appropriate attire: Temperatures
below zero and 30-mph winds pushed wind chill factors down to 50
degrees below zero.
   Sunday's forecast called for showers in the Northwest from
Oregon to Washington and Montana.
   Thunderstorms were expected from Colorado to Texas, with a thin
band extending from North Dakota to Minnesota. A crescent of
thunderstorms also was predicted to curve northeast from southeast
Mississippi, turning to showers in parts of North Carolina.

<HEAD>Gadhafi Says He Would Have Rocketed New York in 1986</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi called on Arab nations
Saturday to develop nuclear weapons and said he would have fired
missiles at New York had he possessed them when U.S. planes bombed
Tripoli in 1986, Libya's news agency reported.
   ``If the world enjoys the missiles and bombs we must be able to
enter this game,'' the official JANA news agency quoted him as
saying.
   In the dispatch monitored in Rome, Col. Gadhafi said Arab
nations need to have nuclear weapons as a deterrent ``within the
next 20 years.''
   ``If we had a deterrent force of missiles able to reach New York
we would have directed them at that very momment,'' he was quoted
as saying. ``We therefore must have this force so that the
Americans and others would not think to attack us once again.''
   The United States bombed Tripoli and Benghazi in 1986 in
retaliation for what it called Libyan support for international
terrorism.
   Gadhafi said Arab nations must work together so that ``the whole
Arab world becomes one single country possessing a deterrent force
(of) missiles and even nuclear bombs,'' JANA reported.
   ``If the world enjoys the missiles and bombs we must be able to
enter this game,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Libya does not have an advanced nuclear program, but U.S.
officials said earlier this year that Libya possesses factories to
producing poison gas.
   There have also been repeated allegations that Iraq is
attempting to produce nuclear weapons and already has medium-range
missiles capable of launching nuclear warheads.
   On March 28, British customs officials seized U.S.-made parts
for atomic bomb triggers bound for Iraq. Iraq has denied seeking a
nuclear capability, but has confirmed that its arsenal includes
chemical weapons.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein recently threatened to destroy
half of Israel with chemical weapons if Israeli forces attacked his
country.

   Erte, whose pioneering art deco designs in
graphics, fashion and theater of the 1920s returned to popularity
in recent years, died Saturday, a hospital spokesman said. He was
97.
   A spokesman at Paris' Cochin Hospital refused to disclose the
cause of death. Friends said Erte was hospitalized in poor health
three weeks ago after returning from a vacation on the Indian Ocean
island of Mauritius.
   Erte _ whose real name was Romain de Tirtoff _ was known as a
painter, sculptor, lithographer and set designer. He designed
costumes for the legendary dancer Anna Pavlova and the
performer-spy Mata Hari.
   The prolific artist designed every cover of Harper's Bazaar from
1915 to 1936.
   His most recent project was to design the sets for the Broadway
musical ``Stardust.'' Some of his other major designs for sets and
costumes included Debussy's ``Pelleas et Melisande'' and Racine's
``Phedre.''
   He was also well-known for the opulent clothes and sets he
designed for George White's ``Scandals,'' the Ziegfeld Follies and
the Folies Bergere.
   ``He was just a genius,'' said Harris Shapiro, president of the
Dyansen Corp. gallery chain in an interview in Los Angeles. ``I
think history will reflect a few years from now that he was one of
the greatest artists of the 20th century.''
   He helped pioneer art deco designs. The style, derived from
cubism, is characterized by slender forms and straight lines
expressive of modern technology during the 1920s and 1930s. It _
and Erte _ regained popularity beginning in the mid-1960s.
   Born Nov. 23, 1892 in St. Petersburg, Russia, Erte decided to be
an artist from the moment he could use colored pencils.
   ``I was interested in fashion and even sketched a dress for my
mother when I was about five,'' he said.
   The family expected him to follow in the tradition of serving in
the Russian navy, but Erte went to Paris at age 19 to study art and
changed his name from Tirtoff to Erte.
   Times were hard, but he loved Paris, and later his parents and
sister joined him during the Russian Revolution. A second-rate
French seamstress had meanwhile hired and fired him, saying he
would never succeed in art or fashion.
   But he was soon working for the great designer Paul Poiret.
Later came a major contract with William Randolph Hearst and
Harper's Bazaar, which shot Erte to fame across the Atlantic as
perhaps the leading star of art deco.
   About 1925 he began work on what became probably his best-known
works, his alphabet designs. The 26-part series took him nearly 40
years to complete.
   The alphabet features the Erte woman: festooned with jewels and
trailing feathers and furs. Often, at the end of a diamond-studded
leash, was the ultimate art deco fur _ a leopard or panther.
   Erte became a French citizen and lived in Paris most of his
life, but once said ``I am probably better known in the States.''
   The United States often honored him with big retrospective shows
_ including one at the Smithsonian Institution and at big galleries
all over the country during his 90th year.
   In the postwar period, his reputation faded and his work was
dismissed as kitsch.
   However, in the mid-1960s he was rediscovered. Diana Vreeland,
the former Vogue editor, declared that no one in the 20th century
had a greater influence on fashion.
   Erte's designs, graphics and sculptures now command respectable
prices at top galleries. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York
has more than 200 Erte drawings and paintings in its collection.
   In later years, he spent several months a year in Barbados and
Majorca, where he had many of his sculptures cast.
   In Paris, he lived comfortably but modestly in a flat near the
Bois de Boulogne with a view of the Eiffel Tower.
   Always appearing trim and elegant, even past 90, Erte kept fit
by walking long distances. But he once said he didn't start
exercising until he was 70.
   ``I drink and eat what I like, smoke a little bit,'' said the
artist, who looked fit at a birthday party at Maxim's last November
hosted by fashion designer Pierre Cardin.
   A lover of nature, Erte surrounded himself with natural forms
like seashells and living things _ including a couple of
aristocratic Burmese cats and at least eight turtle doves in a
glass cage.
   Funeral arrangements were not immediately known. Erte was never
married and had no known survivors.

   ``Junior'' Gotti, son of reputed mob boss John
Gotti, gave the press the slip at the church where he was expected
to be married Saturday, but was spotted at a hotel looking very
much the groom.
   Clad in a simple black tuxedo and black tie and accompanied by a
bride in an ornate wedding gown with train and boquet, John A.
``Junior'' Gotti arrived at the Helmsley Palace Hotel about 5:15
p.m.
   Gotti had fooled and eluded assorted reporters and shutterbugs
who staked out his neighborhood church Saturday afternoon.
   The elder Gotti, who's used to the intense scrutiny of federal
agents, was shadowed instead by local media types desperately
seeking bridesmaids. But the press found no sign of the bride's
family or the Gambino Family at Our Lady of Grace Roman Catholic
Church in Queens.
   Rumors were rampant this week that the younger Gotti, whose dad
is the reputed head of the nation's most powerful crime family,
would be walking down the aisle Saturday with Kim Albanese. The two
have been dating for three years, friends say.
   Junior himself dismissed the reports.
   ``I don't know what you're talking about,'' he told the Daily
News. ``You guys believe everything you hear?''
   His dad, the ``Dapper Don,'' wasn't wearing a tux Saturday
afternoon when he slipped out the back door of his Queens home and
zipped over to his local hangout, the Bergin Hunt and Fish Club.
   At the Helmsley, a large Italian flag fluttering outside the
building was the only thing even hinting at a bash for Junior.
   Law enforcement officials say that the younger Gotti followed
his father in the Gambino family business last year. He is 26 and
is said to be president of a Brooklyn trucking company; he has been
arrested several times in bar fights.

   Penny Maple has promoted organ
donations ever since she became the first woman to undergo a heart
transplant in Michigan five years ago. Now she hopes for a donor
heart that may save her critically ill son.
   Maple's son, Tom Van Buren, entered Bloggett Memorial Medical
Center a month ago with a worsening case of cardiomyopathy, the
same deterioration of the heart that she suffered.
   Maple and Van Buren, 29, are fighting an uphill battle to
promote organ donations in Michigan. According to the Organ
Procurement Agency of Michigan, the number of donated organs has
remained at about 400 every year since 1986. But as of January, 751
patients were waiting to undergo transplants.
   ``It's ridiculous,'' Van Buren said. ``Every day in Michigan
somebody dies who could be a donor and help me or somebody else.
It's such a shame people are ignorant of the need for their
organs.''
   ``I think there's concern and interest, but there's a lot of
apathy,'' Dr. William LaPenna, a cardiologist at Blodgett, said of
the lack of donors. ``People don't realize this can happen to
anybody. It can happen to people in your family too.''
   Because his heart is so diseased, Van Buren was moved to the top
of a list of 60 people in Michigan awaiting a donor heart. He takes
medication to keep his heart beating and will undergo the same
operation his mother underwent when she was 57.
   ``We were taken back so completely that another member of the
family could have this happen,'' said Maple, who waited 6{ weeks
for a heart. ``It's almost like somebody wrote a story and wanted
to throw in all the punches.''
   ``This is a whole new ball game,'' Maple said of her son's
condition. ``I'm the one who can't do anything, the one who looks
down through this window, wondering how long he's going to be able
to breathe OK.''
   Maple realizes that as she waits along with her ailing son for
the surgery that saved her life and may save his.
   ``I don't know whether it's a gift or a sentence,'' she said.
``When you get this heart, you want to take care of it every single
day and get every minute you can out of it.''

   On a picture-perfect day, President Bush
went fishing in the Florida Keys on Saturday as the administration
continued its wait-and-see approach toward Moscow's economic
squeeze on Lithuania.
   ``Wish us luck'' the vacationing president called to onlookers
as his party pulled away from shore on Florida Marine Patrol
speedboats for a daylong fishing expedition.
   The sun was bright and the weather was warm.
   Bush, clad in a green shirt, camouflage pants, red cap and white
satin Wyoming centennial jacket, was accompanied by Brent
Scowcroft, his national security adviser.
   His other fishing buddies were Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady, Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., and Overseas Private Investment
Corp. Chairman Fred Zeder.
   Bush has been coming to this sportfishing haven for years,
angling for bonefish and tarpon in the sand flats and coral reefs.
   The group was gone about eight hours, but Bush said they only
caught a few small fish. He went jogging before dinner.
   As the president relaxed, his administration continued
consultations with allies about possible action against the Kremlin
for its coercion of Lithuania, which is struggling to break away
from Soviet control.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush would not
be making any calls himself Saturday, leaving that assignment to
other officials.
   A senior U.S. official Saturday said Secretary of State James A.
Baker III had had a telephone discussion about Lithuania with
Soviet Foreign Minister Edouard Shevardnadze early Friday
afternoon. A previous telephone conversation between the two was
announced on Wednesday.
   Baker's consistent approach to the Soviets has been a call for a
peaceful solution to the dispute with the maverick republic.
   But the administration, moved by escalating Soviet pressure on
Lithuania, has raised the prospect that Bush will announce some
steps against Moscow this week.
   The most likely course of action is in the commercial field,
such as suspending talks aimed at a trade agreement or reversing
course toward giving Moscow favorable trade status.
   However, Bush has given Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at
least several days of breathing room to reconsider his tactics.
   After returning to Washington on Sunday night, Bush is to meet
early in the week with congressional leaders to discuss possible
courses of action.
   Fitzwater, talking with reporters at a resort hotel, said he
could not provide any new information, beyond his statement Friday
that the United States was increasingly concerned by developments
in Lithuania and that Bush would meet with lawmakers.
   Officials said they did not know when that meeting would take
place, although the president has a regularly scheduled meeting on
Tuesday with members of Congress.
   Leaving room for Moscow to reverse course, Fitzwater refused to
say Saturday whether Gorbachev had already crossed the line that
would trigger some form of retaliation. ``We're still consulting,''
he said.
   On Friday, the spokesman had said ``I would assume that we would
be prepared to announce actions fairly soon'' after Bush meets with
members of Congress.

<HEAD>Local Uprising Leaders Cancel Strike Orders</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Palestinian uprising leaders in the largest
town in the Israeli-occupied West Bank on Saturday canceled an
order from the rebellion's clandestine leadership for a two-day
general strike, Arab reports said.
   The orders for a work stoppage on Sunday and Monday were
contained in a leaflet distributed this week by the Unified
National Leadership of the Uprising, which closely identifies with
the PLO.
   However, activists in Nablus issued their own leaflet Saturday,
calling off the strike because of ``special conditions'' in the
city of 120,000, a Palestinian journalist said.
   He said it was the first time that Nablus leaders canceled
strike orders from the unified leadership.
   Strike days occasionally have been canceled in smaller towns and
villages, but never in Nablus, a stronghold of Palestinian
nationalism.
   Arab reports said the leaflet argued the Israeli army could
impose an extended curfew on the city in response to the general
strike. This would make it very difficult for residents to
celebrate the end of the Islamic fast month of Ramadan, later this
week.
   Masked activists marched through the city center Saturday
announcing the cancellation, witnesses said.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, meanwhile, troops shot and wounded
at least six Palestinians in clashes in the Khan Yunis refugee camp
and the nearby village of Bani Suhaila, Arab hospital officials
said. The army confirmed five of the wounded.
   Palestinian reports and the Israeli news agency, Itim, said
unrest began in Khan Yunis after soldiers intervened to save an
Arab who was severely beaten by uprising activists after he was
caught trying to sell thousands of dollars worth of counterfeit
Jordanian dinars.
   Also Saturday, Greek Orthodox Patriarch Diodorus I led a
procession of priests in the old, walled city of Jerusalem to
protest a Jewish settlement in the Christian quarter.
   The priests were joined by about 100 Palestinian youths, some of
them masked and waving outlawed Palestinian flags, witnesses said.
Six youths were reportedly detained by police after the march.
   The church has contended the settlers are illegally occupying
four church-owned buildings, and two lower courts and the attorney
general ordered their eviction. The Supreme Court blocked the
eviction until it hears an appeal by the settlers Thursday.

   A top-floor fire routed 150 guests from a
five-story hotel near the Las Vegas Strip before dawn Saturday but
fire alarms and a rapid evacuation prevented all but minor injuries.
   The fire destroyed the roof and fifth floor of the 75-room Las
Vegas Inn but only seven minor injuries were reported among hotel
guests and 60 firefighters involved, said city spokesman Doug
Bradford.
   The hotel had fire sprinklers on just the bottom two floors but
the Fire Department had developed a firefighting plan specifically
for the inn and the scheme was credited with saving lives and most
of the structure.
   ``We've done training exercises on that fire scenario. We knew
where everything was; we knew the situation going into it,''
Bradford said.
   The fire apparently began in the attic but the exact point of
origin and cause had yet to be determined. The roof fell on the
fifth floor but lower floors had only smoke and water damage.
Damage costs weren't estimated.
   Evacuees and scores of onlookers stared as firefighters poured
water onto the top of the hotel, where the fire broke out just
before 2:30 a.m. and sent smoke billowing past the casinos of the
glittering Strip two blocks away.
   ``All of our plane tickets and everything is in there, said
Carol Grass, of Fort Bragg, N.C., looking up to her room as charred
shingles fell free.
   ``We were right there,'' she said. ``Right where those shingles
fell.''
   Two guests suffered smoke inhalation, two had minor cuts and
bruises and one had chest pains. One firefighter sprained an ankle
and another suffered a minor wrist injury, the city spokesman said.
   The Fire Department was called at 2:29 a.m. and firefighters
were on the scene by 2:35 a.m., Bradford said.
   ``The alarms went off. Immediately we got a call from hotel
security that there was a fire there. They in turn evacuated the
fifth floor,'' he said.
   Firefighters checked the fifth floor, found no one, and hurried
the evacuation from the lower floors, the spokesman said.
   Guests reported that the fifth floor was suddenly filled with
smoke and they dropped to the floor and exited, saving themselves
from smoke inhalation, Bradford said.
   It took 40 minutes to control the fire to the point where
firefighters could return to the fifth floor and attack remaining
hot spots.
   The city initially reported that the hotel had fire sprinklers
that aided the battle against the flames. Bradford said it was
determined later that the hotel only had sprinklers on the bottom
floor and second-floor mezzanine.
   Fire sprinkler retrofitting laws were enacted in Nevada after
the disastrous MGM Grand Hotel fire which killed 87 people in
November 1980.
   However, the Las Vegas Inn was exempt from retrofitting laws
because the building's height did not exceed 55 feet, Bradford said.
   The hotel was inspected in January and alarms were found to be
working.

<HEAD>Horst Sindermann, Former East German Parliamentary Leader, Dead at
74</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Horst Sindermann, a former high-ranking East
German Communist official and Parliament leader, has died, the
official ADN news agency said. He was 74.
   Sindermann, who was ousted from power last year along with the
hard-line government that had ruled for four decades, died Friday
from a heart attack, ADN said, quoting family members.
   Sindermann was a member of the ruling party Politburo and
president of the Communist-dominated Parliament until November,
when mass demonstrations toppled the hard-line leadership.
   Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere, East Germany's first freely
elected leader, sent his personal condolences to Sindermann's
widow, Ingeborg Sindermann, ADN said.
   The son of a Dresden book printer, Sindermann was jailed for
eight months in 1933 for after joining a Communist youth group. He
was convicted of high treason in 1935 and spent the next 10 years
in Nazi prison camps until the end of World War II.
   After the victorious Allies divided Germany into East and West,
Sindermann served as editor of various Communist Party publications
and held regional party posts until named to the Politburo in 1967.
   Nine years later, he became president of Parliament and a member
of the former council of state.
   His duties included overseeing the press and radio, guarding
against any softening of the government's hard socialist line.
   After the demonstrations that toppled former party leader Erich
Honecker, the Communist leaders who replaced him purged many
members of the old guard. Sindermann was stripped of power and
party membership in November.
   An investigation began in January to determine if Sindermann
should be charged with crimes against the country. It was abandoned
a month later because of Sindermann's poor health.
   A Communist caretaker government allowed free elections March 18
and a government led by non-Communists was elected.
   Several other fallen leaders are in poor health, including the
78-year-old Honecker, who resides in a Soviet-run sanitarium in
East Germany.
   A year ago, Sindermann's death would have warranted a huge state
funeral. The government news agency ADN had no information on
surviving family members or funeral service plans.

<HEAD>Hungarian Group Holds Congress Amid Tight Security</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORADEA, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An organization of ethnic Hungarians
opened its first congress Saturday, only a month after bloody
clashes between the ethnic minority and Romanians in the northern
city of Tirgu Mures.
   Security checks were carried out on all roads leading into
Oradea, a city of 240,000 near the Hungarian border. Police
patrolled the city and placed a cordon around the conference site,
and helicopters hovered overhead.
   The Democratic Federation of Romanian Hungarians was to nominate
its candidates for the country's first multiparty parliamentary
elections May 20 after almost 40 years of Communist rule.
   The 346 delegates were meeting just a month after clashes in the
Transylvanian city of Tirgu Mures. At least seven people were
killed and many others injured.
   The ethnic Hungarian federation was officially registered at the
end of January, one month after the revolution that toppled
Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. The federation, which puts
its membership at 700,000, says it intends to field candidates in
all regions.
   Federation chairman Geza Domokos said the group was set up to
protect the interests of about 2.1 million ethnic Hungarians in the
nation of 23 million. The ethnic Hungarians are concentrated in the
region of Transylvania.
   The conference was attended by representatives of the National
Salvation Front, which heads the country's interim government,
opposition political parties, two Hungarian political parties, and
observers from the Soviet and Hungarian embassies.
   At the opening of the congress, Domokos said there was ``no
other alternative'' for Romania than democracy.
   Switching to speaking in Romanian, he emphasized that ``where
Transylvania belongs is not at issue. ... There is no room for
ideas questioning the sovereignty of the Romanian nation.''
   Ethnic Hungarians have been demanding language and other
minority rights. But Romanian nationalists have accused them of
secretly harboring desires for Transylvania to secede from Romania.
   Transylvania was part of Hungary in the Austro-Hungarian Empire,
but after World War I the region was ceded to Romania.
   The Ceausescu regime persecuted the ethnic Hungarian minority as
part of its official policy aimed at creating a homogeneous society.
   After the December revolution, the new National Salvation Front
government promised to address the ethnic Hungarians' grievances.
   But Domokos told the Congress that so far ``the Front has failed
to implement its declared policy on minorities. We see only
hesitation and uncertainty on the issue.''

   A former dissident poet was elected
chairman of the Romanian Writers' Union on Saturday at the group's
first free congress since World War II.
   The congress also approved a new charter of the 1,700-member
union calling for political and financial autonomy of writers from
state control.
   Mircea Dinescu, elected as chairman, said in an opening speech
Wednesday that Romanian writers should discard their fears which
prevented them from freely expressing their thoughts.
   ``We are an independent union. We are no longer run by the
ministries of culture, labor and foreign affairs,'' he said.
   Dinescu, 40, was the first to appear on Romanian television to
tell the people and the world that dictator Nicolae Ceausescu had
been overthrown on Dec. 22, 1989.
   During more than four decades of Communist rule, the Writers'
Union was run by the Council of Socialist Culture and Edcuation, a
government-led body which supervised all cultural life in Romania.
   The council was dismantled in the wake of the December
revolution.

<TEXT>
   Princess Stephanie of Monaco and French property
magnate Jean-Yves Le Fur announced their engagement Saturday night
to friends and relatives at a private party in a Paris restaurant,
the restaurant owner said.
   Among the 50 or so guests were Stephanie's older siblings,
Princess Caroline and Prince Albert. Albert is heir to the
principality's throne.
   After Le Fur gave Stephanie the engagement ring, they toasted
their coming nuptials with champagne, said Bernard Marck, owner of
the chic Le Telegraph restaurant.
   The palace issued no official statement on the engagement. But
after persistent demands by journalists, press officials at the
palace confirmed a report about the engagement published Saturday
in the French newspaper Nice Matin.
   Sources close to the palace had said the engagement would be
made known to family and friends at the party, and an official
announcement would be made in the principality next week.
   About two dozen police officers manned the streets around Le
Telegraph as a parade of cars let off the partygoers.
   Le Fur and Stephanie entered the restaurant without speaking to
reporters. Monaco's ruler, Prince Rainier III, had been expected to
attend but was not seen by photographers.
   Stephanie, 25, has appeared in public several times this year
with Le Fur, 26. They have been seen together at the Festival of
Magic in Monte Carlo and at boxing and soccer matches.
   The youngest of three children born to Rainier and film star
Grace Kelly, Stephanie has cut a hit record, made a movie and
marketed a perfume named after her.
   Le Fur operates a real estate firm in Paris.
   The princess was injured in the car accident that claimed the
life of her mother in 1982. Rumors in the celebrity press placed
Stephanie behind the wheel, but the palace maintains Princess Grace
was driving.

   Two University of Massachusetts
researchers have been experimenting the past four years with
inducing bacteria to grow a natural form of plastic that would be
biodegradable.
   Biochemist R. Clinton Fuller and Robert Lenz, a polymer
scientist, brew their natural plastics in jars full of fermenting
bacteria.
   ``These plastics are made by microorganisms and they can be
digested by microorganisms,'' Fuller said.
   The scientists' work differs sharply from the degradable
plastics made with cornstarch that have appeared in the past few
years. Those bags have come under criticism because they are mostly
synthetic and do not degrade in landfills.
   The pair have reached the point where they can produce small
amounts of a tough, clear rubbery material that is a combination of
several types of polymers.
   Polymerization is the science of chaining together simple
molecules to form a more complex molecule with different physical
properties.

   The founders of a coral reef protection

<HEAD>Police Intensifying Manhunt for Medellin Cartel Leader</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police said they have intensified their
manhunt in Medellin for reputed cocaine chieftain Pablo Escobar
following several bombings and the slaying of a newspaper employee.
   The Bogota daily El Espectador, whose main offices were bombed
last year by traffickers angered by their anti-drug stand, was not
distributed Saturday in the northern city of 2 million following
the shooting death Friday of a deliveryman.
   The newspaper said it would halt its circulation to the cocaine
trafficking center ``until the lives and work of our collaborators
can be guaranteed.''
   Police raided private homes and offices of businesses, including
one building that contained some city government offices, in the
search for Escobar, said Gen. Carlos Arturo Casadiego, the
assistant director of the national police.
   ``We are giving this maximum priority,'' he told reporters late
Friday. Escobar is the reputed leader of the Medellin cartel, which
U.S. officials say is responsible for much of the cocaine entering
the United States.
   Police had already upgraded the search by sending 300 members of
a special anti-terrorist unit to Medellin following a car bombing
April 11 that killed 20 people, including eight police officers.
   Casadiego also said he had ordered an investigation into the
killing of the delivery man for El Espectador.
   Authorities will try to determine why two policemen guarding the
paper's Medellin distribution offices had left their posts shortly
before the killing outside the offices, Casadiego said.
   Gunmen fled after they shot and killed the man charged with
distributing the paper in the city.
   The Medellin cartel threatened in a recent communique to carry
out more terrorist attacks against El Espectador, a leading
crusader against the drug lords.
   The delivery man was the seventh El Espectador employee killed
since the drug traffickers began a terrorism campaign in August.
   The traffickers have been blamed for more than 200 deaths since
then.
   Also Saturday, police said a group of armed men attacked a farm
outside of Medellin, burning 15 antique automobiles and a luxury
ranch house in suspected violence between rival drug traffickers.
The men used explosives to destroy the farm's swimming pool, police
said.
   The property, located in suburban Envigado, is registered in the
name of Hector Arango, an engineer. But police raided the farm two
times last year because of suspicions that it belonged to drug
traffickers.
   A judge is deciding whether or not to expropriate the property.
Arango is out of the country, police said.

   The Elliott's commanding officer determined the Vietnamese boat

   He said the refugees, which included 23 men, seven women and
five children, were found to be generally in good health after
being at sea for six days since leaving the town of Vien Loa.
   Gradisher said the refugees will be brought to Singapore.

   About 500 people marched through this New
York City suburb Saturday to protest the handling of an
investigation into the police shooting of a black teen-ager that
has heightened racial tensions.
   A vigil for the dead youth April 12 turned into a riot in a
community that has prided itself on racial harmony.
   The march, scheduled to start at 1 p.m., began two hours late as
about 200 people from the area waited until seven busloads of
marchers arrived from New York City, led by the Rev. Al Sharpton, a
black activist.
   Sharpton marched down Teaneck Road, a main business district in
the township, flanked by associate Alton Maddox Jr., Lenora Fulani,
chairwoman of the New Alliance Party, based in New York City. Also
with him were the parents of Yusuf Hawkins, a black teen-ager
allegedly killed by white youths in the New York borough of
Brooklyn.
   The mile-long march ended outside the township's police station,
where speakers demanded that a state grand jury return a murder
indictment of the white police officer who shot and killed Phillip
Pannell, 16, on April 10.
   ``We demand that this man be arrested,'' Sharpton said. ``He's
committed a crime. He's committed a murder.''
   The officer, Gary Spath, 29, was suspended with pay pending a
review of the shooting, a decision that angered some blacks who
said he should have been taken off the payroll.
   Pannell, 16, of River Edge, was shot in the back. Investigators
said a gun was found on the youth's body, but friends of Pannell
dispute that claim.
   ``Don't keep looking for a gun that isn't there,'' Sharpton said.
   The march and rally were peaceful.
   Before Sharpton arrived, Tony McKinley, a black resident of
Teaneck, stood holding his 16-month-old daughter, Toni.
   He said he was marching because he wanted to ``wake up the town
that we want justice.''
   The community has been tense since a candlelight protest against
Pannell's shooting erupted into a disturbance in which black
teen-agers and young adults overturned police cars, broke store
windows on Teaneck Road and attacked people on the street. At least
five people were injured.
   A grand jury in Trenton is to begin investigating the case early
next week.

   About 1,200 people, including members of
institutions that Benjamin Franklin founded more than two centuries
ago, marched Saturday in a ``funeral procession'' commemorating the
200th anniversary of his burial.
   People dressed in period costume took part in the fesitive
procession that depicted Franklin's legacy to Philadelphia and the
nation. The procession stretched five blocks from Independence Hall
to Christ Church Burial Ground.
   Some of the 1,200 people who came out in a light rain tossed
pennies on Franklin's grave, a tradition that began with his
saying, ``A penny saved is a penny earned.''
   The city hopes to draw an 1 million visitors more than usual
this year with its yearlong tribute to Franklin. According to the
visitors bureau, more than 35 museums and groups are dedicating
programs and exhibits to Franklin.
   On April 21, 1790, roughly 20,000 people, or about half the
city's population, lined the streets to honor the budding nation's
elder statesman, inventor and publisher.
   ``Ben would have enjoyed this,'' Bob Dewel of Baraboo, Wis.,
said Saturday ``He was a jolly guy.''
   An admirer of Franklin, Dewel and his wife traveled to
Philadelphia for the celebration.
   A fire fighter walked with a Dalmation, a reminder that Franklin
organized the first fire department in Philadelphia. About 140
employees of the Philadelphia Contributionship and their families
marched in red rain slickers to remember the founder of the
nation's first property insurance company.
   Members of the American Philosophical Society, which Franklin
started, also marched through the historical district, as did a
delegation from the U.S. Postal Service, in honor of its first
postmaster general.
   There also were representatives from the Free Library of
Philadelphia and students from the University of Pennsylvania, two
more institutions Franklin helped establish.

   Forty South African religious leaders
began a two-day meeting Saturday with African National Congress
officials to discuss the return of South African exiles.
   The Rev. John Lamola, head of the ANC religious affairs
department, said long-term exiles are expected to encounter
difficulties finding homes and jobs when they return home.
   They are also likely to face emotional stress in readjusting to
life in white-governed South Africa, he said.
   About 20,000 South Africans, including ANC members and other
apartheid opponents, are estimated to be living in exile worldwide.
Many have been abroad for as long as 25 years.
   ``We'll be discussing the response of the churches to the plight
of these exiles,'' said Lamola. ``We want to draw the attention of
those in South Africa to these problems.''
   The religious delegation included representatives from the South
African Council of Churches, the Catholic Bishops Conference, and
the Moslem, Hindu and Jewish communities.
   Medical experts and social workers from South Africa were also
taking part in the discussions.
   In reforms announced Feb. 2, South African President F.W. de
Klerk lifted bans on the ANC and other anti-apartheid opposition
organizations.
   The ANC, which advocates black majority rule, is to hold talks
in early May with de Klerk on the political future of the country,
which has some 28 million blacks and 5 million whites.
   The ANC moved its headquarters to the Zambian capital of Lusaka
after it was banned by South African authorities in 1960.

   Indian and Pakistani soldiers exchanged
gunfire along the border in the northern Jammu-Kashmir state
Saturday, killing at least one Pakistani soldier, Indian army
officials said.
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
battle occurred near the border town of Poonch after Pakistan
attempted to dig a trench on the border.
   Further north, Indian forces shot and killed six civilians who
were illegally crossing the frontier, a state government spokesman
said.
   Tension along the border has been heightened in recent weeks
because of Indian allegations that Pakistan is supplying arms and
training Moslem militants who demand the secession of the Kashmir
province from Hindu-dominated India.
   Pakistan denies the charges and says New Delhi's comments are
intimidatory.
   Also Saturday, the Human Rights Committee for Kashmir in
Pakistan asked the United Nations for help in the region.
   Led by Agha Shahi, a former minister of state for foreign
affairs, the group urged the U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez De
Cuellar to intercede with New Delhi to ensure ``Indian armed forces
act in Kashmir strictly in accordance with principles of humanity.''
   About 280 people have died and thousands more arrested in
Kashmir since Jan. 20 as a part of India's crackdown against the
secession movement.
   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over the region and a
U.N.-monitored cease-fire line divides the area into Indian and
Pakistani sectors.
   A state government spokesman, who cannot be identified under
briefing rules, said the six killed were Moslem militants who were
returning to India after arms training in Pakistan.
   Another five militants were injured and nine arrested, the
spokesman said. In Kashmir, 23 militants were arrested by security
forces, he said.
   In Srinagar, the largest town in Kashmir, militants shot and
killed a Hindu policeman during relaxation of a curfew, which was
invoked at the beginning of the month, witnesses said.

<HEAD>Antigua and Barbuda to Seek Extradition of Suspected Israeli Arms

<TEXT>
   The Caribbean nation of Antigua and
Barbuda plans to seek the extradition of an Israeli suspected of
involvement in a 1989 arms shipment that ended up in the hands of
Colombian drug traffickers.
   ``It appears conclusive that one Mr. Morris Safarti was
associated with the arms handling and can now be called upon by the
government to account for his action,'' Prime Minister Vere Bird
Sr. said Friday. His remarks were broadcast on radio and television.
   ``The Cabinet has therefore advised that appropriate steps will
be taken to extradite Mr. Safarti to Antigua with a view to
pressing appropriate charges,'' Bird said.
   The government did not say where Safarti was, but there were
reports he was in the United States or Israel.
   It was not clear what connection Safarti, who owned a melon farm
in eastern Antigua two years ago, had with the arms shipment.
   Colombian officials have said that the arms were shipped to the
Antigua and then diverted to drug traffickers working with the
Medellin cocaine cartel.
   On Monday, Bird issued a statement denying allegations that the
country's defense forces had first purchased the weapons.
   He said Saturday that the arms shipment included
rocket-propelled grenade launchers, anti-aircraft guns and
automatic rifles.
   The weapons were shipped from Haifa, Israel, to an Antiguan port
and then shipped to Santa Marta, Colombia, according to a
preliminary investigation led by Deputy Prime Minister Lester Bird,
the prime minister's son.
   In February, Colombian soldiers found 232 Israeli-made weapons
during a search of ranches seized from Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, a
leader of the Medellin drug cartel who was killed in a December gun
battle with police, Colombian Defense Minister Oscar Botero said
last week.
   The weapons found included assault rifles, machine guns,
submachine guns, pistols, shoulder-fired rockets and infrared night
scopes, Botero said.
   He said authorities have not been determined how the weapons
wound up with Medellin drug traffickers.
   Bird said ``it has become evident...there were irregularities
and breeches of our customs regulations in handling the arms which
were transshipped through Antigua in April 1989.''
   On Monday, Bird said that documents were falsified and customs
procedures ignored to facilitate the passage of the arms shipment
through Antigua.
   The mystery over the Israeli weapons follows a scandal that
broke last year concerning the alleged involvement of Israeli
mercenaries in training the private armies of the Medellin cartel.
   The Colombian government has formally charged two Israelis, Yair
Klein and Arik Afek, with complicity with the Medellin cartel.
   Colombian authorities have requested the extradition of Klein, a
former Israeli army lieutenant colonel, who is in Israel.
   Afek was found dead Jan. 24 in the trunk of his parked car at
Miami International Airport in what police describe as a gangland
slaying.

<TEXT>
   To protest the Soviet Union's pressure on
Lithuania, the president of Daemen College has withdrawn his
invitation to a Soviet diplomat to speak at the school's
commencement.
   Igor Khripunov, first secretary of the Soviet Embassy in
Washington D.C., had already agreed to speak at the private liberal
arts college's May 13 commencement.
   ``I know it's not exactly the most genteel thing to do, but I
think I'm right,'' Robert S. Marshall said of his decision to
cancel the invitation.
   ``I could not in good conscience present to our graduating class
a representative of a country which uses the jackboot of tyranny to
attempt to halt a movement toward freedom,'' he said.
   Marshall said he originally wanted Khripunov as a speaker
because of the Soviet Union's apparent ``momentum toward
democratization.''
   A spokesman for the Soviet Embassy said Khripunov had not
received the letter and could not comment on the decision.

<HEAD>Northwest: Pilot Accused of Being Drunk has ``Impeccable Record''</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Northwest Airlines pilot who was wrongly
accused by a passenger of being drunk has an ``impeccable record''
over more than 20 years of service, an airline spokesman said
Saturday.
   In part because of the accusation, a flight from Detroit to
Atlanta was delayed for nearly four hours Thursday night. The
pilot, who was called in after the scheduled pilot was delayed en
route from Milwaukee, insisted that he be given an alcohol and drug
test to prove he was sober.
   ``We have had no problem with his performance with the
company,'' spokesman Bob Gibbons said of the pilot, who took a
blood test that showed he had no alcohol in his system. He refused
to identify the pilot.
   The plane was delayed nearly four hours while another substitute
pilot was found.
   When the plane finally left, the passenger and her husband
stayed behind because other passengers were angry with them,
Northwest spokesman Douglas Miller said.
   The woman and her husband were ``subjected to quite a bit of
verbal abuse from the other passengers and they elected not to take
the flight,'' Miller said. The couple took another flight Friday
morning.
   Thursday's incident occurred aboard Flight 497, due to leave
Detroit at 8:30 p.m.
   As passengers waited for the substitute pilot to arrive, the
woman began talking to other passengers, saying the pilot was late
because he was probably drunk or partying, Miller said.
   When the pilot arrived, a flight attendant took him aside and
told him of the woman's concerns.
   The pilot ``felt his integrity was being questioned, so he asked
if the lady wanted to speak to him,'' Miller said. ``She did.''
   After hearing her accusations, he insisted on being tested.
   Gibbons identified the woman as Ann Beaver of the Detroit suburb
of Bloomfield Hills. A call to her home Saturday was answered by
her stepson, Brad Beaver, who said she and her husband, Harvey,
were in Atlanta on vacation and unavailable to comment.
   It wasn't known whether the woman's concerns were prompted by
the arrest of three Northwest pilots on March 8 in Minneapolis,
where they were accused of flying from Fargo, N.D., while drunk.
They were fired by the airline and face state and federal charges.
   Miller said the airline supports the actions of the substitute
pilot.
   ``We feel he was justified,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   One of America's worst kept military
secrets, the F-117A stealth fighter, was unveiled Saturday to a
crowd of thousands who cheered a demonstration flight by two of the
multimillion dollar planes.
   The two bat-shaped planes swept in under thin cloud cover and
passed over Nellis Air Force Base, banked sharply against the Las
Vegas skyline and landed to give the public its first closeup of
the once top-secret aircraft.
   There was an eerie whine as the lead craft, piloted by Capt.
Randall Peterson of Rock Island, Ill., made a pass 58 feet above
the runway. The second, piloted by Maj. Steven Charles of
Springfield, Mass., then swept by the crowd, circled and landed.
   Both jets were surprisingly quiet in flight and while taxiing to
an area encircled by several thousand people, including military
families, VIPs and 225 reporters and photographers, including 37
from five foreign countries.
   Viewing was opened to the public later and as many as 150,000
people were expected.
   Foreign journalists represented Britain, France, Australia,
Japan and West Germany. Asked if any Soviet reporters were on hand,
Tech. Sgt. Bobby Shelton, the stealth unit information officer,
replied, ``They didn't ask us.''
   The F-117A costs more than $100 million a copy, according to a
recent report by the General Accounting Office. The Air Force gave
a figure of $42.6 million _ the so-called fly-away cost of one
plane, without counting development costs for the program.
   No performance details were released, other than that the
radar-evading F-117A is a single-seat, twin-engine subsonic jet.
``It is a fighter in every respect,'' Peterson, 30, told the crowd.
   He said the jet has outstanding handling and gives the United
States unprecedented capabilities. Pressed about those
capabilities, he said, ``We're not allowed to discuss any
capability. A lot of the information is still classified.''
   Referring to an F-117A nickname that has surfaced, he said,
``Nobody that flies the stealth aircraft calls it a wobbly goblin.''
   Also off-limits were questions on reports that a stealth fighter
used in the U.S. invasion of Panama last year dropped bombs far
from its target.
   ``The bombs hit exactly where they were aimed,'' Randall said
before another Air Force officer broke in and said, ``We can't
discuss information like that.''
   ``I only wish I could tell you what this fighter can really
do,'' said Ben Rich, vice president of Lockheed Corp., which builds
the jet at its secret ``Skunk Works'' in Burbank, Calif. ``The
performance is awesome and the weapons system is unmatched anywhere
in the world.''
   Though the ``fighter'' designation suggests dogfights with other
planes, the F-117A's main mission is as an attack jet. It is
designed to sneak through enemy defenses and bomb selected targets
such as defensive radar installations. The Air Force only recently
lifted the shroud of secrecy on the F-117A, which long had been
rumored to exist and has been flying for a decade. Previously, only
pictures had been shown.
   The stealth fighters are attached to the 37th Tactical Fighter
Wing at the Tonopah Test Range, a remote airfield 140 miles
northwest of Las Vegas.
   Most of the 2,500 military personnel assigned to the program
live in the Las Vegas area and commute to Tonopah each week. For
their families, the public demonstration was the first view of the
plane.
   The F-117A is a relatively simple aircraft to fly and operate.
said Col. Anthony Tolin, commander of the 37th. With only three
accidents in nine years, it has the best safety record of any Air
Force plane, he said.
   A test pilot survived the crash of the initial plane. Two Air
Force officers were killed in other accidents during operational
training.
   A total of 59 stealth fighters have been purchased and the last
will be delivered this fall. Each costs $42.6 million.
   Lt. Gen. Peter Kempf, commander of the 12th Air Force, said it
took 31 months to develop the stealth fighter, compared to a normal
aircraft development time of 10 to 12 years. The first stealth
fighter flight was in 1981, and the first production aircraft were
delivered to the Air Force a year later.
   The plane was flown strictly at night and over remote deserts
until November 1988, when the Air Force acknowledged the aircraft's
existence.
   Officials said the secrecy was lifted because the plane needed
to start flying in daylight. Tonopah residents have reported seeing
the F-117A in flight for several years.

   Troops killed six pro-Iranian guerrillas in a
raid north of Israel's self-proclaimed security zone in southern
Lebanon, the army said Saturday.
   No Israeli casualties were reported in the raid. It was Israel's
first incursion north of the security zone in four months.
   The military command said a force of infantryman from the elite
Givati brigade attacked a group of militiamen from the radical
Moslem fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party of God movement, in the
area of Ein Al-Tineh village three miles northeast of the security
zone.
   Lebanese police said the raid began with four Israeli helicopter
gunships firing 12 air-to-ground missiles into the village Friday
night, killing six. A police spokesman said Israeli gunships struck
``minutes'' after Hezbollah guerrillas returned to the village from
a parade they staged in a nearby town to mark ``International
Jerusalem Day.''
   Hezbollah released a statement saying the air raid came after
its fighters clashed with Israeli soldiers on the northern edge of
the security zone.
   Israeli military officials said the Givati troops attacked the
Hezbollah fighters at night in a hilly area controlled by the
pro-Iranian militiamen.
   The army said the soldiers fatally shot six guerrillas. They
said the uniformed guerrillas were carrying assault rifles, hand
grenades and other military equipment.
   The officials said the pro-Iranian militiamen have bases in the
area for training and launching raids on the Israeli army, its
southern Lebanese allies and the security zone enclave.
   The soldiers returned to the security zone Saturday morning, the
army said.
   Hezbollah has carried out numerous raids on the enclave, a 6- to
10-mile-wide buffer strip along the Israeli border. The area is
patrolled by Israeli troops and about 2,000 fighters of the South
Lebanon Army, a mostly Christian, Israeli-trained militia.
   Israel carved out the zone in 1985, when it withdrew the bulk of
its troops from southern Lebanon following a three-year occupation.
   The last Israeli attack north of the zone was Dec. 26, when
paratroopers backed by tanks killed several guerrillas belonging to
the Lebanese Communist Party.
   The latest raid came a day after Israeli warplanes twice
attacked a tunnel complex used by Syrian-backed Palestinian
guerrillas above the coastal town of Naameh south of Beirut. Two
people were wounded.
   The Israeli air force has carried out at least 11 strikes in
Lebanon this year, killing 10 people and wounding 31.

<HEAD>Scientists Say Alaska Volcano Follows Stable Pattern</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mount Redoubt exploded Saturday morning
with perhaps its smallest blast to date, scientists said, but the
eruption is significant because it is part of an unusually stable
pattern.
   Geologist Steve Brantley, with the Alaska Volcano Observatory,
said the eruption at 6:11 a.m. ADT, sent steam and ash about 25,000
feet into the air. The volcano is about 110 miles southwest of
Anchorage. Light winds were not expected to carry ash to Anchorage.
   Redoubt's recurring stirrings happen about once every six or
nine days and are regular enough that the observatory now issues
warnings, predicting when the next blast will occur.
   It's been right _ or nearly right _ at least four times since
December.
   Saturday's eruption happened just six hours earlier than
predicted. Brantley said scientists had set the time window from
noon Saturday to noon Tuesday.
   ``Mount St. Helens never exhibited this kind of regular,
eruptive activity,'' Brantley said, referring to the destructive
volcano in Washington state.
   ``Kilauea Volcano (on the island of Hawaii) did produce many
eruptive episodes, several dozen that occurred at varying
intervals,'' he said. ``But there wasn't such a fixed pattern.''
   Lava from Kilauea destroyed three houses Friday and at least one
on Saturday.
   Brantley says Redoubt does not always give telltale warning
signs, such as heightened earthquakes at its base or discernible
swelling.
   Instead, scientists are adding up the number of explosions over
a certain period and basing their predictions on the average number
of days between explosions.
   ``It's interesting that it's in this pattern,'' Brantley said.
``Volcanoes do not usually do this.''
   He said geologists were 70 percent certain that an explosion
would occur sometime after noon Saturday.
   Redoubt erupted less than 14 hours after a light earthquake
shook the Denali National Park area, some 300 miles north of the
volcano.
   There were no immediate reports of damage. Brantley said the two
geologic events were unrelated.

   Frank J. Lausche, a conservative Democrat who
served five terms as Ohio governor and two as a U.S. senator, died
Saturday of heart complications. He was 94.
   Lausche died about 1:30 p.m. at the Slovene Home for the Aged,
said his sister-in-law, Antonia Lausche. He had been at the home
since Feb. 22.
   Lausche's long political career ended in 1968 with his defeat _
due mostly to a long-running feud with organized labor _ in the
Democratic primary for re-election to a third term in the U.S.
Senate.
   He was the only Ohio governor to be elected five times.
   ``He had a beautiful, wonderful life. We're sorry he didn't live
long enough to see Slovenia become an independent country,'' said
Mrs. Lausche. ``They're part of Yugoslavia right now, but they're
fighting for independence.''
   Lausche lost his first two races _ for the Ohio House in 1922
and the Ohio Senate in 1924. In 1932, he was appointed judge of the
Cleveland Municipal Court. In 1941, he was elected mayor of
Cleveland, a post he held until his election in 1944 to the first
of five terms as governor.
   Although a Democrat, Lausche earned a reputation as an
independent who often ignored party positions and consistently
proved popular among independents and Republican voters.
   Lausche was born Nov. 14, 1895, in Cleveland, one of 10 children
of Slovenian immigrants. Lausche's father and oldest brother died
when he was 12, forcing him to help support the family. He got a
job lighting gas-powered street lights for $2 a week.
   After service in the Army and stints with minor-league baseball
teams, Lausche yielded to a long-held desire to become a lawyer. He
attended night classes and got his law degree at age 25, ranking
second in his class.
   Lausche is survived by a sister, Josephine Lausche Welf, 95, who
lives at the Slovene Home, and three sisters-in-law. His wife,
Jane, died in 1981.

   Americans and Norwegians on Saturday honored
a young army captain who became the first U.S. soldier to die in
World War II when he was killed in a German air raid.
   Capt. Robert M. Losey died April 21, 1940 at age 31 in the
central Norwegian village of Dombaas. He was on a mission to help
American civilians flee the April 1940 German invasion of Norway.
   U.S. and Norwegian officials and war veterans joined 400 people
for the ceremony in the village memorial park, laying a wreath on
an eight-foot-high stone monument marking his death.
   ``Capt. Losey's sacrifice was followed by the battle deaths of
292,131 Americans later in the war,'' said Loret Ruppe, U.S.
ambassador to Norway. ``Just as Captain Losey is now forever linked
to Dombaas, the United States and Norway are forever linked in
friendship and remembrance.''
   A native of Andrews, Iowa, Losey was killed when German bombs
exploded near a mountain tunnel where he had sought shelter. The
attack came nearly 20 months before the Japanese attacked Pearl
Harbor, which drew the United States into the war.
   A 1929 U.S. Military Academy graduate, Losey was buried at West
Point.
   Losey was an army air attache and aide to Florence Harriman, the
U.S. minister, or senior diplomat, in Norway. They were to lead the
evacuation of American personnel from Oslo to neutral Sweden.
   Losey, arriving from Finland, joined Mrs. Harriman near the
Swedish border and volunteered to go to Dombaas, an important
railroad and highway junction 150 miles north of Oslo.
   Losey felt the trip was too dangerous to risk a senior diplomat.
Dombass, a mountain village, was bombed heavily by the Germans
after an unsuccessful paratroop attack.
   During an air raid, Losey moved closer to the entrance to the
entrance of the tunnel he was in to observe the attack. One bomb
exploded near the entrance, killing Losey and several British
soldiers.
   Mrs. Harriman, who eventually made it to Stockholm, later said
the news of Losey's death ``was a horrible shock.''
   In the early days of the war, she wrote her ``sense of loss in
the world was centered in that one young American.''

   Fire badly the national electric company's
administration building Saturday, one day after some of its
officials were arrested for fraud, the News Agency of Nigeria
reported.
   The agency said minister of mines, power and steel, Mura Iman,
suspected arson, saying the fire ``smacks of sabotage.'' Several
National Electric Power Authority employees were arrested at the
scene.
   The building caught fire before dawn and was still burning late
Saturday, the agency said.
   ``I feel terrible and emotional about this incident, coming at a
time when the country's economy is at its lowest ebb,'' Iman said.
   Few details were available concerning the electric company
officials detained for fraud. The government has alleged that many
customers received electricity without paying.
   The fire is the latest in a series of accidents at government
facilities in this West African nation, including fires at the
national oil and phone companies.
   Nigeria, an OPEC member, suffered economic problems when
petroleum prices fell in the early 1980s. Widespread corruption
also has been blamed.

<HEAD>Report: U.S. and Peru Agree on Details of Anti-Drug Military Aid
Package</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States is beginning a $35 million new
military aid program to expand the drug war in Peru by helping the
Peruvian government fight leftist guerrillas who protect coca
growers and traffickers, according to a published report.
   The New York Times quoted a top U.S. official in Lima as saying
the United States will build a military training base in the heart
of the coca-growing region to train and equip six battalions, to
provide river patrol boats and to refurbish 20 ground attack jets.
   The official emphasized that _ in accordance with agreements
reached at the Feb. 15 drug summit in Cartagena, Colombia _ the
U.S. military would be limited to a training role.
   The report in Sunday's editions notes that the $35 million
figure for military aid was first mentioned last fall, but that
final approval was withheld pending agreement on how the money
would be spent.
   The Times said U.S. Ambassador Thomas Quainton has been
authorized to sign an agreement with Peru's Defense Minister, Julio
Velazquez Giaccarini, that would allow money in the military aid
package to start flowing.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Adam Shub said he was
unable to determine Saturday night whether a final agreement had
been reached, or to provide details in it.
   However, he noted that increased military aid for Peru and other
Andean nations has long been contemplated as part a $2.2 billion,
five-year package proposed by President Bush and that discussions
on details have been under way with the affected countries for
several months.
   Bush proposed $68 million for anti-drug efforts in Peru for
fiscal 1990 and Congress approved $47 million.
   The $35 million military aid component detailed in the Times
report apparently is part of the overall $47 million package.

   Every day is Earth Day in this tiny cattle
and farming community in west Texas.
   But the 1,250 folks who live here, called Earthlings, are not
sparing the chance to capitalize on the 20th anniversary Sunday of
the national observance of Earth Day.
   ``This is the opportunity that we have been waiting for,'' said
Noel Pittman, the town's Earth Day chairwoman. ``This day was made
for Earth, Texas.''
   When Earthlings say there is something in the air, they usually
mean dust, tumbleweed or the pungent stench of cattle herds just
east of town. But this weekend they are talking about excitement.
   Not since a Dairy Queen commercial was taped in Earth two years
ago has there been such a buzz among the locals, Ms. Pittman said.
   ``The Dairy Queen commercial put us on the map, at least in
Texas,'' she said. ``Most everyone from Earth was in the commercial
and people still talk about it. But we are hoping Earth Day will be
even bigger.''
   To ensure a large turnout from natives and surrounding towns,
the Chamber of Commerce held Earth Day activities on Saturday.
   City officials acknowledge that many of the people attending the
outdoor ceremony came simply to mix with neighbors in some place
other than the bank or Dairy Queen.
   ``I am sure there are some people here that have no idea what
Earth Day is or what it means,'' said Ms. Pittman. ``But maybe the
activities will help make them more aware. If not, they will have a
great time greeting folks.''
   The post office is capitalizing on Earth Day by issuing a
commemorative postmark.
   Since Earth is the only town in the United States with that
name, it is the only place where an Earth Day pictorial postmark
can be found, said postmaster Don Hallett.
   The postmark, which is inked across stamps as a void, features a
tree outlined in green with ``April 22, 1990, Earth'' scripted in
the branches.
   Mayor Raiford Daniel said he would love to see Earth become the
national headquarters for future Earth Day celebrations.
   ``This could be the beginning of something big,'' Daniel said.
``That is what we are hoping for. If the rest of the country
decides that we should be the focal point for Earth Day activities,
all they have to do is call. We will be here.''

   Nicholas C. Chriss, a veteran reporter who
covered the civil rights movement, the construction and demolition
of the Berlin Wall, the space program and three presidential
campaigns, died Saturday of a heart attack. He was 62.
   During the 1950s, Chriss covered the emergence of the civil
rights movement, beginning with the Rev. Martin Luther King's rise
to leadership at Montgomery, Ala.
   In 1956, when Rosa Parks took her historic first ride seated at
the front of a Montgomery bus, Chriss accompanied her in his
capacity as a United Press International correspondent.
   He also covered King's assassination in Memphis in 1968.
   When the Communists erected the Berlin Wall in 1961, Chriss was
there, and he returned there last December as a reporter for the
Houston Chronicle when the wall began coming down. He joined the
Chronicle in September 1979.
   Chriss reported on the presidential campaigns of George
McGovern, George Wallace and Ronald Reagan. He also covered the
space program throughout the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo eras, and
reported on the 1986 Challenger disaster.
   In recent years, he made two trips to the Soviet Union reporting
on the Soviet space program. He also traveled to Eastern Europe in
recent months to cover the emergence of pro-democracy movements.
   Chronicle Editor Jack Loftis said, ``I will miss him as a
professional journalist and as a good friend.''
   A native of Painesville, Ohio, Chriss entered the Army upon
graduation during World War II, and was stationed in the Aleutian
Islands.
   After the war, he attended the University of Missouri,
graduating in 1952 with bachelor of arts degrees in journalism and
in German literature and language.
   His first newspaper job was with the Northeast Mississippi Daily
Journal at Tupelo. He went on to work for UPI at Atlanta, London
and Frankfurt, Germany.
   He was the Houston bureau chief for the Los Angeles Times before
going to work for the Chronicle.
   Chriss served as the first president of the Atlanta Press Club
after its organization in the 1960s and as president of Press Club
of Houston for the 1977-78 term.
   In addition to his wife, Jutta Hausen, a mathematics professor
at the University of Houston, he is survived by a son, a sister and
two daughters, including Catherine Chriss, a general assignment
reporter for the Chronicle.

   The United States plans to build a training
base where U.S. soldiers will instruct the Peruvian army in jungle
warfare to fight leftist rebels, a U.S. Embassy official said
Saturday.
   The new base will be built in the coca-rich Upper Huallaga
valley as part of a $35 million U.S. military aid package. The aid
is one of several U.S. measures as part of President Bush's
strategy announced in September to fight the flow of drugs from
Andean nations.
   ``We've been building the pipeline and now its starting to
flow,'' said a U.S. Embassy spokesman. For security reasons, he
spoke on condition his name not be used.
   Bush asked Congress for $2.2 billion over five years to help
Colombia, Bolivia and Peru fight drug trafficking. The package
apparently will come from $47 million approved for fiscal 1990 by
Congress for anti-drug efforts in Peru.
   Plans call for U.S. military personnel to train five Peruvian
army battalions and one navy battalion that currently operate in
the Huallaga valley, the spokesman said. He gave no figure for the
number of U.S. personnel to be involved.
   The base is to be built near the anti-drug base at Santa Lucia,
250 miles north of Lima in the jungle, he said. That base has been
the staging ground for interdiction operations involving Peruvian
police and U.S. drug agents against smugglers in the valley.
   The base was attacked April 7 be a large column of Shining Path
guerrillas. No one on the base was wounded, but a number of the
rebels were believed killed.
   The pre-dawn attack was repelled by two U.S. helicopters armed
with M-60 machine guns and flown by American contract pilots. It
was the first time any of the 10 State Department UH-1H helicopters
on loan to Peru for drug operations were directly involved in a
battle with the rebels.
   The spokesman said the two bases will be able to support each
other in case of rebel attack.
   ``We think that this will increase the capacity to deal with
large subversive movements in the area,'' he said.
   The $35 million will also pay for weapons, communications
equipment and uniforms for the six battalions, which will be
rotated through the base in small groups, the official said.
   ``They will be provided basic counterinsurgency training to
improve field effectiveness and efficiency in dealing with Sendero
Luminoso in the valley,'' the spokesman said.
   ``Sendero Luminoso'' is the Spanish name for the Shining Path
rebels, a Maoist-inspired group that operates in league with drug
traffickers in the Upper Huallaga valley.
   U.S. officials have said the U.S.-sponsored drug fight has been
ineffective in Peru because of the lack of security in the valley.
The Bush Administration has insisted development aid for the area,
such as crop substitution programs, be predicated on improved
security against leftist guerrillas.
   Other aspects of the new program call for the United States to
provide river boats to the Peruvian navy to use in patrolling the
extensive river systems in Peru's eastern jungles.
   Much of the chemicals used in the cocaine-making process come
into the country from Colombia and Brazil by way of the many Amazon
tributaries along the borders. They are also used to carry the drug
out of the country.
   The program also calls for the United States to refurbish about
20 A-37 attack jets belonging to the Peruvian air force. They will
be used to provide air support in the fight against the Shining
Path.
   The spokesman said the training base would be built and
operating within a few months. He said plans for three other bases
being discussed by U.S. and Peruvian officials.
   The announcement of the new program comes as Peruvians await the
second round of presidential elections between Mario Vargas Llosa
and Alberto Fujimori. Both candidates have said they would allow
U.S. military personnel to come to Peru for training purposes.
   About a dozen Green Berets are training Peruvian police in
jungle warfare at a base in Mazamari, 180 miles east of Lima.

<HEAD>The Likely Candidate for Author of Shakespeare's Plays? _ Try
Shakespeare</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLAREMONT, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After years of sophisticated,
computerized studies, a group of scholars trying to find out who
really wrote Shakespeare's plays have settled on a likely candidate
_ Shakespeare.
   Students and faculty at Claremont McKenna College's Shakespeare
Project presented those findings Saturday, said college spokesman
Robert Daseler.
   But one mustn't leap to the conclusion that ``All's Well That
Ends Well'' or even that the three-year project turned out to be
``Much Ado About Nothing.''
   For the head of the Shakespeare Project, Ward Elliott, still is
unconvinced that William Shakespeare knew of what he wrote, said
Daseler. He is only willing to concede that after three years of
study, just about all other prominent Elizabethan writers that
other scholars once thought were the real writers of Shakespeare's
plays really weren't. And that leaves as the only serious
contender, well, Shakespeare.
   Or maybe a fairly obscure Elizabethan poet named Fulke
Greyville. Or perhaps even Queen Elizabeth I.
   But apparently not Christopher Marlowe or Francis Bacon _ two
prominent Elizabethans that many scholars have long argued may have
used Shakespeare's name as a nom de plume.
   For nearly two centuries, English scholars have debated whether
someone with Shakespeare's education _ about that of a modern-day
high school graduate _ could have written plays that showed such a
precise knowledge of falconry, geography, court manners and several
foreign languages, to say nothing of such a stunning command of the
English language.
   ``Wouldn't somebody who was better educated, who had gone on to
Oxford and studied Greek and all these other things have been more
likely to have written those plays,'' asked Daseler.
   That's what Ward, a political science professor, Robert Valenza,
a mathematics professor, and several students sought to find out.
   Key to their research, Daseler said, was a field of mathematics
and computer technology called signal processing that organizations
like the Central Intelligence Agency use to analyze data.
   ``Using the signal processing method, Valenza and three to four
students working with him analyzed Shakespeare's work in terms of
some of the key words that Shakespeare used frequently,'' Daseler
said. ``They analyzed 52 that seemed to have more than a random
importance to Shakespeare.''
   Among the words were grief, ground, heaven, hope, lovers,
desire, death tears, praise, secret and voice.
   The researchers compared the way Shakespeare used the words to
the way other writers, including Marlowe, Bacon and Greyville, used
them.
   In all, the researchers put more than 3 million words, including
884,000 written by Shakespeare, into computer data banks for their
battery of tests.
   What they found was that the works of Bacon and Marlowe weren't
that similar to the works of Shakespeare, Daseler said. Nor were
the works of John Donne, Edmund Spenser, Michael Drayton or Edward
deVere, the 175th earl of Oxford, all of whom have been suspected
of being the real writer of Shakespeare's plays.
   ``Greyville might qualify,'' Daseler said. ``His work showed a
great deal of consistency with regard to Shakespeare's. Queen
Elizabeth I also showed a little bit of consistency.''
   But the general conclusion of most of the scholars was that
Shakespeare wrote the plays.
   ``Valenza now says he believes Shakespeare wrote Shakespeare,''
Daseler said.
   ``Ward Elliott, who has been heading this study up for three
years, still believes they're going to find somebody else,''
Daseler added. ``But he does admit that they have eliminated all
the existing claimants.''

   Sandinista army troops began clearing
out of five neutral zones Saturday, making way for Contra rebels
who have promised to disarm.
   U.N. observers were moving into the five security zones to
monitor the military withdrawal and the rebel demobilization.
   Also Saturday, the 14-party coalition of President-elect Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro elected conservative Miriam Arguello as the
head of the new National Assembly.
   Ms. Arguello, a 63-year-old lawyer who had been jailed by the
Sandinistas after a 1988 opposition political rally.
   She defeated Alfredo Cesar, a close Chamorro adviser, in a 28-23
vote by deputies from Mrs. Chamorro's 14-party coalition, the
United National Opposition. The election was seen a defeat to Mrs.
Chamorro.
   Earlier, outgoing President Daniel Ortega bade farewell to the
old Sandinista-dominated assembly, saying the Sandinistas will put
the interests of the nation above those of the party.
   Voters weary of war and poverty put an end to more than a decade
of rule by the leftist Sandinistas in the Feb. 25 general
elections. Mrs. Chamorro's victory paved the way for the cease-fire
and demobilization accord.
   The Defense Ministry claimed the Contras had violated the
cease-fire by hijacking a truck in a remote mining region Thursday
but said Sandinista troops were withdrawing anyway.
   ``The Sandinista army has begun retiring from the security zones
to allow the members of the resistance to enter them,'' a ministry
spokesman, Capt. Carlos Lara, said Saturday.
   The withdrawal operation was launched Thursday, the day a
permanent cease-fire in Nicaragua's 9-year-old civil war began, he
said.
   The peace accord calls for the Contras to begin disarming April
25, the day conservative President-elect Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro takes office. The deadline for total demobilization is
June 10.
   The bulk of the rebel army, estimated at between 9,000 and
12,000 fighters, has returned to Nicaragua from Honduran base camps
in the past few months.
   Scattered strikes by Sandinista workers continued Saturday
despite public appeals by Ortega and lame-duck Interior Minister
Tomas Borge to end the walkouts.
   Labor leaders say they are conducting a two-pronged campaign
aimed at pressuring the Contras into fulfilling their promise to
disarm and at winning wage concessions from the new government.
   Bank workers, who walked out Friday, were expected to return to
work Monday, the Sandinista party newspaper Barricada said, while
telephone workers remained out.
   The pro-Sandinista media also reported strikes by miners on the
Atlantic Coast, teachers in some provinces, Ministry of
Construction and Transport workers and a variety of other
government workers.
   Despite the skepticism of the Sandinista rank-and-file, party
officials seemed confident the demobilization would go according to
schedule.
   The chief spokesman for the Defense Ministry, Lt. Col. Rosa
Pasos, said that the ministry had ``abundant information that the
Contras are heading for the security zones, ready to demobilize.''
   The first U.N. peacekeeping troops were to arrive Sunday in
Nicaragua from Honduras, where they oversaw the demobilization of
the small contingent of Contras who remained in Honduras after the
elections.
   The troops, all Venezuelan soldiers, were scheduled to deploy in
the northernmost of the five security zones on Monday, said U.N.
spokeswoman Angelica Hunt.
   A total of 700 peacekeepers will be deployed by next Saturday,
said Ms. Hunt, who spoke in a telephone interview from Honduras.
   The return to Nicaragua of thousands of armed guerrillas had
provoked a crisis that threatened the peaceful transfer of power to
Mrs. Chamorro, who is favored by Washington.
   The Sandinistas finally gave up on their demand that the Contras
disarm by inauguration day and the Contras backed off their demand
for the army to demobilize.
   The Sandinistas came to power in the July 1979 popular uprising
that toppled the rightist government of Anastasio Somoza and ended
40 years of pro-U.S., Somoza family rule.

   A small earthquake struck Saturday in
an area hard-hit by October's killer quake, but there were no
immediate reports of damage or injuries.
   The temblor, which struck at 7 p.m., measured 3.5 on the Richter
scale and was centered in the southern end of the Loma Prieta
aftershock zone, said Pat Jorgenson, a spokeswoman for the U.S.
Geological Survey in Menlo Park.
   Loma Prieta was at the center of the 7.1-magnitude quake that
struck the San Francisco Bay area in Oct. 17, killing 67 people and
doing $7 billion in property damage.
   ``Just yet another of the continuing series of aftershocks,''
said Jorgenson.
   A dispatcher for the Watsonville Police Department said she
received several calls from residents who wanted to know if they'd
just felt an earthquake, but no one reported damage or injuries.
   ``It was a rolling,'' she said. ``It seemed like it lasted
forever.''
   Watsonville is 70 miles south of San Francisco, just inland from
Monterey Bay.
   A 3.5-magnitude quake is capable of causing slight damage in the
immediate area.

   An economics professor was
killed Saturday after a bomb exploded in his car as he was
preparing to leave the University of El Salvador, police reported.
   Randolfo Tejada, who also was the director of the Salvadoran
Institute for Rehabilitation of the Disabled, died in surgery after
the explosion and fire, a police spokesman said. He spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   No suspects have been identified in the bombing, and no group
has claimed responsibility.
   Academics and intellectuals have often been targeted by
right-wing extremists in El Salvador's decade-long civil war. At
least 71,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in the
fighting between leftist guerrillas and a succession of U.S.-backed
governments.
   Police said Tejada was getting into his car at the university's
economics school after teaching a class when the bomb went off,
wounding him and setting fire to his car.
   Police said they believe the explosive device was placed in
Tejada's car while he was teaching the class.
   Tejada was rushed to the Salvadoran Social Security Institute
Hospital, where he died.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Biography written as a book can be more
comprehensive than biography done as theater, which tends to hit
the high spots but does, literally, give flesh to the subject.
   An example of theatrical biography, titled ``Mountain,'' is now
running at the Lucille Lortel Theater off-Broadway. In it, actor
Len Cariou plays the late Justice William O. Douglas.
   It's a one-man show with a chorus of two. Heather Summerhayes
and John C. Vennema become people in Douglas' life and speak the
criticisms of conservatives against the liberal who was on the
Supreme Court from 1939 to 1980.
   In ``Mountain,'' one gets a feel of what was important to the
man: that constitutional rights not be taken from people, no matter
what their race, politics or wrongdoing, that freedom includes the
right of privacy, and that wilderness areas be protected forever
from development.
   The play, by Douglas Scott, makes Douglas a full-blooded person
and is careful to show faults, not letting him be right all the
time.
   As the play begins, one's heart sinks. It's stagey and anecdotes
sound like too-cute party pieces. The ending isn't satisfactory,
either, getting overheated as Douglas rails extensively.
   But recounted aspects of Douglas' life pull one into the play.
According to ``Mountain,'' Douglas was President Roosevelt's first
choice for vice president in 1944.
   And Cariou is touching acting Douglas as a boy and later going
from Washington state to New York by train. He states Douglas'
convictions compellingly.
   The focus, wisely, isn't on Douglas' private life. His first
wife is shown as a shy person, his second, less clearly, as
personable, his third and fourth not detailed at all.
   John Henry Davis directed. K &amp; D Productions, Margery Klain and
Robert G. Donnalley Jr. produced in asociation with Lucille Lortel.

   Britain on Friday repeated a 10-year-old offer to
restore diplomatic relations with Albania. The statement from the
Foreign Office came a day after Albanian leader Ramiz Alia urged
the Soviet Union and the United States to restore ties with the
Eastern European nation.
   ``There have recently been increasing signs that Albania wishes
to play a fuller part in the international community,'' the Foreign
Office said.
   ``We also note that Mr. Alia, in his remarks, makes no reference
to Britain's generous offer 10 years ago, to restore diplomatic
relations without pre-conditions. We hope the change in Albania's
general tone will lead them to look at our offer,'' the Foreign
Office said.
   In recent weeks, Albania has made several recent moves to
increase ties with the West, including the re-establishment of
telephone communications with the United States and several other
Western nations.
   It was announced Friday that U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar will visit Albania, the last bastion of hard-line
Communism in Eastern Europe, in mid-May.
   Relations with Britain were broken in 1946 after two Royal Navy
vessels struck mines and sank in the Corfu Channel, near Albania's
coast.
   Albania refused to pay compensation and Albanian gold held in
the Bank of England was impounded.

<HEAD>Kennedy Winter White House Won't Be a Landmark</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALM BEACH, Fla.(AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Kennedy family quietly won its fight
Friday to prevent preservationists from designating as a town
landmark the $3 million home that once served as a winter White
House.
   The Palm Beach Landmarks Preservation Commission listened to a
report on the historical and architectural value of the seaside
estate, called ``La Guerida,'' but all seven members were silent
when chairman James Sullivan asked for a motion to make the report
a part of the record.
   A request for any other motions also met with silence, removing
the matter from the commission agenda.
   Although commission members felt strongly that the home should
become a landmark, Sullivan said ``the Kennedy family's
intransigence'' _ and the threat of a costly legal battle _ doomed
the proposal.
   ``I think the commission did the right thing,'' he said. ``We
can't act as Don Quixotes, fighting windmills.''
   Attorneys for the estate's owner, 99-year-old Rose Kennedy, said
nothing during Friday's meeting. But in an April 2 letter, they
argued the commission could not legally declare the property a
landmark because the Town Council denied it that status 10 years
ago.
   In 1980, the council unanimously rejected the landmark
commission's recommendation to declare the Mediterranean revival
style mansion a landmark after an attorney for the family argued
that the landmark ordinance violated Mrs. Kennedy's right to due
process. The Kennedy family has said it wants to maintain complete
control over the property.
   The letter also said the home did not qualify as a landmark,
citing a consultant's report in 1980 that declared the mansion _
built by Addison Mizner in 1925 _ as being ``certainly Mizner at
his poorest.''
   Commission members, however, said it should become a landmark
because of its association with President John F. Kennedy, who held
Cabinet meetings and played touch football with family members on
the beach three decades ago.
   Owners of landmark homes are required to get permission from the
commission before making structural or cosmetic changes. They also
may be pressed to renovate if the commission determines the
property needs work.
   Palm Beach has designated historical status to about 130 homes,
including billionaire Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago.
   Of the homes that have been deemed landmarks since the ordinance
passed in 1979, only a handful of owners have objected, Sullivan
said. Those owners said the landmark requirements violate their
rights and could make homes more difficult to sell.
   The Kennedy home was built for Redman Wanamaker of the
Philadelphia department store chain. Members of the family,
including Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., still visit the estate, but
Mrs. Kennedy no longer spends winters there because of failing
health.

<TEXT>
   New York City has become the robbery capital of
the United States, far outdistancing Detroit, which previously led
the nation, according to recently reported FBI figures compiled by
the Police Department.
   New York's rate of robberies in 1989 was 1,271 for every 100,000
in population, police said. Detroit's figure was 1,095 and
Washington, D.C., came in third with 1,055.
   The total number of robberies in New York last year amounted to
93,377, or one every six minutes, an increase of nearly 8 percent
over the previous year. Not surprisingly, the number of people who
want guns, bulletproof vests and bodyguards also increased,
officials said.
   Rounding out the top 10 in per-capita robberies were Baltimore,
1,043; New Orleans, 1,013; Boston, 1,011; Dallas, 928; Los Angeles,
913; Cleveland, 743, and San Francisco, 664.
   To compile the rankings, the Police Department used preliminary
national crime figures for 1989 released by the FBI three weeks
ago. The FBI's final, official figures are due in August.
   In other major crime categories, Washington was first in murder,
and New York, after the greatest number of slayings in its history,
was ninth on a per capita basis, police said.
   New York City last ranked No. 1 for robberies in 1981, when more
than 107,000 were reported, said Police Commissioner Lee Brown.
   Police said that during the time the number of robberies
increased, the number of applications for gun permits went to
6,397, up 10 percent for the year. If the trend continues, the
number will increase another 15 percent in 1990.
   Stephen D'Andrilli, a security consultant whose company
specializes in obtaining gun permits for a fee that can run up to
$4,000, said Friday that business has gone up 22 percent in the
past six months.
   ``People come in and tell me `I've got to get a permit now. I'm
not going to wait around and be victimized,''' D'Andrilli said.
   About 15,000 non-official New York City residents are licensed
to carry guns, along with nearly 12,000 retired police officers,
the department said. An additional 24,000 residents have permits to
keep guns in their homes or businesses.
   D'Andrilli said that since January, his company, Guardian Group
International, has also doubled its sale of bulletproof vests.
Customers also are interested in bulletproof versions of street
clothes like leather jackets, raincoats and even furs, he said.

   State attorneys on Friday asked a judge to
prevent a religious sect that believes a nuclear holocaust is
imminent from occupying a large complex of bomb shelters near
Yellowstone National Park.
   The Department of Health and Environmental Sciences filed a
complaint in Livingston that said continued construction at the
site could increase the chance of more pollution in the aftermath
of a 31,000-gallon fuel spill.
   The agency also requested that the Church Universal and
Triumphant be fined $50,000 for allegedly violating state water
quality laws when the fuel leaked from three underground storage
tanks at the fallout shelter site near Corwin Springs.
   In addition, the state asked that plans for all water and sewage
systems serving bomb shelters on church property be submitted to
the department for review.
   District Judge Byron Robb took no action on the complaint.
   State health officials said earlier they would seek an
injunction to block further construction on the fallout shelter
complex, which can house about 750 people near Corwin Springs. An
estimated 30 smaller underground shelters have been built at a
nearby subdivision.
   The bomb shelters reflect the church members' belief that
nuclear war or some other global catastrophe is imminent.
   The fuel spills were discovered last week and some of the
contamination made its way to nearby Mol Heron Creek, a pristine
spawning ground for cutthroat trout. Additional spills were
reported last weekend.
   Earlier this week, the department issued an order requiring the
church to empty and excavate all 35 tanks buried at the Mol Heron
site. The tanks had a total capacity of 634,500 gallons.
   Friday's complaint seeks a temporary restraining order to block
further construction on the Mol Heron shelters and to prevent the
church from occupying the facilities until the state completes an
environmental review of the project.
   Steve Pilcher, chief of the state Water Quality Bureau, has said
such a review could take six to 12 months.
   Named as defendants in the complaint were the church; Elizabeth
Clare Prophet, church president and spiritual leader; Ed Francis,
her husband and church vice president; and several residents of the
church-owned subdivision of Glastonbury.
   Church spokesman Murray Steinman said the sect would cooperate
with the state fully.

   A Milwaukee man charged with threatening
to kill late-night talk show host Johnny Carson is mentally unfit
to stand trial, a judge has ruled.
   Superior Court Judge Charles Lee on Thursday ordered Ken Orville
Gause to return to court May 11 for a commitment hearing. Gause
will be held in a state mental health facility until he can
understand the charges against him.
   Gause, 37, was charged with five felony counts of making
terrorist threats and five counts of sending threatening letters.
   Authorities said Gause had threatened to kill the host of ``The
Tonight Show'' unless Carson paid him $5 million, which Gause
claimed he was owed.
   Security officers were alerted to watch for Gause after he wrote
of his intended arrival, and he was arrested last December in the
lobby of NBC Studios in Burbank.
   At the time of his arrest, Gause allegedly was armed with a sock
weighted with sand.

   An elderly woman drowned in flood
waters, and 30,000 people in Outback areas remained isolated as
heavy rain continued across much of eastern Australia, police said
Saturday.
   Ngari Roberts, 64, drowned at Mudgee in central west New South
Wales state when her motorcycle was swept downstream as she tried
to cross a swollen creek.
   Her body was discovered late Friday by her husband.
   The town of Charleville, in western Queensland state, was
underwater and officials said an estimated 4,000 people, many
waiting on the roofs of the flooded homes, would have to be removed
by helicopter and boat.
   Queensland state premier Wayne Goss declared the central and
western areas of his state a disater area and promised financial
aid for victinms of the flooding, caused by three weeks of heavy
rain.
   Meteorologists said the rain was the heaviest in 40 years in the
region, which is normally dry and dusty.
   Dozens of small communities remained cut off as the Royal
Australian Air Force continued to drop food and supplies to
isolated rural towns.
   A number of usually placid rivers were overflowing, killing
thousands of sheep and cattle.
   Residents of the New South Wales town of Nyngan worked through
the night to sandbag the banks of the Bogan River and prevent it
from flooding the town center.
   Some of the 90 passengers in a train surrounded by flood waters
near the town of Longreach were evacuated Friday and other
passengers were to be airlifted Saturday.

   The general who led the U.S. invasion of
Panama last December has been named chief of U.S. Special
Operations Command.
   Army Lt. Gen. Carl W. Stiner take over at MacDill Air Force Base
in Tampa on May 24, President Bush announced Thursday.
   Stiner will oversee an estimated 35,000 operations troops
stationed across the country, including Navy Sea-Air-Land (SEAL)
commandos, Army Green Berets and Rangers, and the counterterrorist
Delta Force. The command reports to the Joint Chiefs of Staff and
the secretary of defense.
   The general, who will be promoted to four-star rank, replaces
retiring Army Gen. James J. Lindsay. Lindsay ran the command since
its formation in April 1987.
   Stiner, a 53-year-old Tennessee native, was chief of staff for
the Rapid Deployment Joint Task Force at MacDill from 1980-1982.
   In October 1988, he took command of the 18th Airborne Corps and
Fort Bragg, N.C. The corps is comprised of the 82nd Airborne
Division at Bragg, the 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell,
Ky., and other support elements.
   The Rapid Deployment Joint Task Force at MacDill was formed in
response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the Iranian
revolution. The small headquarters evolved into U.S. Central
Command, which is also based at MacDill and coordinates military
activity in the Middle East.
   Stiner's latest assignment was commander of the Dec. 20 invasion
of Panama under the direction of Gen. Maxwell Thurman, head of the
U.S. Southern Command.
   Dubbed Operation Just Cause, the venture led to the extradition
of Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega to face federal drug charges in
the United States.

President Mikhail Gorbachev a few more days to loosen the economic
noose the Kremlin is tightening around breakaway Lithuania before
the United States moves to respond.
   As the vacationing Bush planned to spend today bonefishing here
in the Everglades, the White House put Moscow on notice Friday to
expect an American response early next week unless Gorbachev eases
the Soviet blockade of oil, gas and other materials.
   Bush himself said nothing during political speeches Friday in
Birmingham, Ala., and Orlando, Fla., about the crisis threatening a

   Asked as he toured Orlando's Sea World why he needed more time
to frame a response, Bush said only, ``There's a lot of

   The largest securities fraud case in Wall Street
history will end next week if a federal judge approves a reported
plea-bargain agreement by former junk-bond financier Michael Milken.
   After a year of maintaining his innocence, Milken agreed Friday
to plead guilty to six felonies related to securities fraud and pay
$600 million in penalties, sources said. In exchange, the
government would drop the most serious charges against Milken.
   The former head of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s high-yield bond
department _ who parlayed risky securities into a
multibillion-dollar business and fueled the takeover mania of the
1980s _ had been named with two others in a 98-count federal fraud
and racketeering indictment last year.
   Prosecutors last month threatened to submit an expanded
indictment Friday unless an agreement was reached.

   Researchers say they've found a new link
between genetics and AIDS that could help explain why some people
become sick soon after exposure while others stave off serious
illness for years.
   In a study of 5,000 infected men from Baltimore, Chicago, Los
Angeles and Pittsburgh, those with a particular genetic background
tended to have a more rapid decline after being exposed to the
AIDS-causing virus, the researchers said Friday.
   ``It has been a point of considerable interest because the
effects of AIDS differ so widely,'' said Dr. June Osborn of the
National Commission on AIDS.
   ``The key finding is that there may be genetic differences that
you inherit that once you're infected with HIV, it increases your
vulnerability to develop severe diseases,'' said Dr. Charles
Rinaldo Jr., an assistant professor of pathology at the University
of Pittsburgh.

   The Soviet Union's economy turned in an
``abysmal'' performance last year and faces the likelihood of
continued inflation and shortages despite President Mikhail
Gorbachev's reform efforts, according to a U.S. intelligence
analysis.
   ``Soviet economic problems reached near-crisis proportions in
1989 as severe consumer goods shortages, inflation and rising
social and ethnic violence left Gorbachev searching for ways to put
his economic program back on track,'' said the report to Congress.
   ``The combination of inflation and shortages made daily life
miserable for all but the most privileged elements of society,''
said the joint Central Intelligence Agency-Defense Intelligence
Agency report.
   CIA Deputy Director for Intelligence John L. Helgerson told the
Joint Economic Committee on Friday that the Soviet economic
performance was ``abysmal in 1989, the worst since Gorbachev took
over'' in 1985.

   When the Brits make something for the telly,
they either do it very, very well or teddibly, teddibly badly. When
the BBC co-produces with U.S. studios, apparently, it comes out
looking like a highbrow ``Love Boat.''
   The USA Network's comedy-adventure miniseries Tuesday and
Wednesday, ``Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less,'' requires a
greater suspension of disbelief than counting on the return of the
tooth fairy when you lose your dentures.
   The show's premise is that four intelligent, honest men suckered
by a crooked financier can combine their talents to scam their
money back from him _ but ``not a penny more, not a penny less.''
   Ed Asner plays the crook. His victims are Ed Begley Jr. as an
American mathematician, Brian Protheroe as a titled British twit,
Nicholas Jones as a Harley Street surgeon, and Francois-Eric
Gendron as a London art gallery owner.
   If you can believe that these clever, successful men can be
swindled, then the rest of ``Penny'' will generally live up to your
expectations.
   There are some very good things about this collaboration of the
BBC with Paramount Television Ltd.-Revcom, most notably the actors
and, of them, most notably the Eds.
   Asner is excellent as the mercilessly corrupt, lonely financier
Harvey Metcalf. He subtly makes himself into a sympathetic
character. Begley's loopy comic style fits in well. He's the
funniest in the ensemble.
   Jenny Agutter, who grows lovelier with time, is Begley's
paramour, and the very attractive Maryam D'Abo provides a love
interest for the viscount.
   Protheroe and Jones have some good bits as well, easily shifting
emotional gears to cope with the very worst thing about this
miniseries: Sherman Yellen's flawed adaptation of Jeffrey Archer's
flawed first novel.
   Yellen's exposition is awful. He asks an actor playing a man
awakened by a long-distance call to say, ``It's the middle of the
night here in England.''
   And then there's this: ``But remember, Harvey Metcalfe is
ruthless and unpredictable.''
   And this: ``You know what I think? I think you're all a bunch of
suckers.''
   It's a tribute to the cast that they energize this enervated
material.
   The miniscams are remarkably improbable, but they fly so
smoothly under Clive Donner's sleek direction that you find
yourself sitting back and looking at the scenery, which includes
London, Monte Carlo and Oxford.
   It's easier to understand ``Penny'' if you know that Archer
wrote it after nearly bankrupting himself. He invested heavily in a
Canadian company that went belly up, with three of its directors
going to prison for fraud.
   Owing nearly half a million quid, Archer resigned from the House
of Commons and couldn't get a job, so he wrote ``Not a Penny More,
Not a Penny Less'' and launched a very successful career as a
novelist and playwright.
   In 1990, his revenge fantasy is on cable TV. For anyone but
Anglophiles and Archerphiles, it may be a bad investment.

   Smiling children skip along dirt
paths, kicking up radioactive dust. They throw stones in their
radioactive playground, then go home for contaminated meat and milk.
   Since cesium, strontium and plutonium descended on their
rooftops, gardens, farms and schools four years ago, the people of
this Byelorussian village and of scores more in the Ukraine and
Russia have been prisoners of Chernobyl.
   They are surrounded and continously bombarded by an enemy they
cannot see, smell or hear. They say their government and the world
have all but forgotten them.
   In Bartolomeyevka, another village, a warm and hearty woman
named Tatiana T. Kharshunova said: ``They did this to us, and we
had to live here. Not just for a month or two but four years. No
one paid attention to us.''
   She and her neighbors grow potatoes and barley in their gardens,
even though the radiation level is 40 curies, nearly three times
the danger level. They can recite the figures like scientists, but
do not seem fully aware of the threat.
   ``I'm as strong as a horse,'' Irina Y. Kovoleva said. She looked
down at her 14-month-old grandson in her arms and added: ``He's
strong, too.''
   The boy and his parents were scheduled to be evacuated the next
day.
   ``I'll cry when they leave,'' the grandmother said. ``The
cemetery is nearby, so I'll die and go there.''
   Nadezhda N. Dmitrochenko of the local governing council said she
tries to explain the dangers of radiation, but ``people still don't
know what this is. ... It doesn't glow and it doesn't whistle.''
   On April 26, 1986, an explosion and fire destroyed one of four
reactors at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the Ukraine, 125
miles southwest of Noviye Gromyki.
   As the children of the village played on a sunny April day four
years later, chickens and cats darted among the green and brown
wooden huts.
   The only sounds were chickens clucking, dogs barking and the
distant roar of tractors plowing contaminated fields in the vast,
fertile plain traversed by a creek.
   The official death toll from Chernobyl remains at 31, but a
Soviet newspaper said last fall it had risen to 250. Scientists
still predict thousands of deaths will be traceable to the accident.
   After years of passivity, the people affected are speaking out.
   Residents of Gomel, the provincial capital, plan a strike and
demonstration Thursday, the anniversary, to protest official
handling of what the government newspaper Izvestia called ``the
greatest technological catastrophe'' in world history.
   Citizens of Kiev, the Ukrainian capital 80 miles south of
Chernobyl, also plan demonstratons. A telethon to raise money for
victims is scheduled in Moscow.
   Protesters demand that officials who concealed the extent of the
danger and delayed evacuating contaminated areas be brought to
trial. They want medical care for victims and supplies of
radiation-free food.
   About 70 percent of the Chernobyl radiation fell on Byelorussia
and contaminated one-fifth of the arable land, an area twice the
size of Massachusetts, where 2.2 million people live.
   Immediately after the accident, about 25,000 Byelorussians were
evacuated, but only last year did officials admit the full scope of
the contamination and decide to resettle more than 100,000 more.
The resettlement will take five years, and people eat and breathe
nuclear poison in the meantime.
   The program appears poorly run. Some evacuees are being
resettled on land that also is contaminated and the government is
building new homes, schools and offices in areas that are being
evacuated.
   Most families with young children have been moved out of Noviye
Gromyki since resettlement began Jan. 1.
   Those still waiting feel abandoned and frightened. They cannot
move on their own because housing must be found for them.
   ``We sit and cry,'' said Claudia A. Kostochka, 75, who was on a
bench with two other women, sobbing. ``They won't take us. We're
pensioners.''
   ``I lived almost a whole century here, raised a son and daughter
here. Two weeks ago they closed our store, so we're eating cabbage
and cucumber preserves from last year. We don't know whether it's
dangerous or not, but we have to eat.''
   A farmer said the milk from his cows was too radioactive to
drink, so he sells it to the government, which makes it into
butter. He said the butter was supposed to be safe.
   Many others interviewed said they drank the milk because there
was no alternative. As many more said they did not bother to have
their home produce checked at a local radiation laboratory.
   Soil and dust carry radioactive particles.
   The only paved surfaces in Noviye Gromyki are one street and the
grade school playground at No. 13 Lenin Street. Winds blow dust
from the dirt roads and fields onto the asphalt and the people, and
into their homes.
   Residents are warned not to gather firewood from the highly
radioactive forests nearby. Burning it makes their stoves into what
specialists have called ``mini-reactors.''
   Villagers are supposed to wash frequently, but they are allowed
only one bar of soap a month, the same as anyone else. Soap is
rationed in most of the country.
   Each household gets 30 rubles a month from the government to buy
uncontaminated food, but it is hard to find. Thirty rubles are
worth $49 at the official exchange rate, but much less in reality.
   In Vetka, a few miles south of Novoyi Gromyki, children are fed
``clean'' meals at High School No. 1 and the crumbling cement
floors are washed several times a day.
   Outside, their protection against radiation consists of paved
playground and a 6-inch-high concrete barrier to keep them off the
sidewalk where contaminated dirt falls from the roof. Students are
supposed to rinse their shoes in a pan of water at the school
entrance, but many don't.
   Several students said they ignored warnings and rode mopeds in
the forest. They complained of headaches and exhaustion, which they
blamed on fallout.
   To the list of ailments the Chernobyl generation suffers, school
principal Nikolai N. Shatilo added bloody noses, swollen thyroid
glands and vision loss. The radiation level at High School No. 1 is
two to three times normal.
   ``We can't provide normal conditions in school,'' he said.
``There's only one thing to do: take them to a clean zone. We must
save the children. They are our future.''
   One student said she was bitter because no one seemed to care,
not even the doctors who examine her class twice a year.
   A 16-year-old boy said: ``We're sick and tired of all the
checkups. What are they for? All they do is keep saying
everything's normal.''

   Construction workers erect new buildings
in this Byelorussian village even as residents prepare to flee
because radiation from the Chernobyl accident endangers their lives.
   Poor organization is wasting millions of rubles. One agency
continues working on construction projects planned before the
reactor explosion and fire April 26, 1986, while others evacuate
residents of the same village.
   Criticism of how the disaster was handled began early. The
government came under attack at home and abroad because the
accident was not reported for two days, after the reactor had sent
up a huge cloud of radiation that eventually worked its way around
the world.
   Politicians elected under more liberal policies introduced since
1986 say full information about radiation levels and health
problems was kept secret.
   The government lifted secrecy restrictions on such information
last year. As politicians learned more, they pressed for, and won,
evacuations of some of the estimated 4 million people still living
on irradiated land.
   Byelorussian writer Ales Adamovich said the alleged coverup, and
official claims that no radiation sickness was diagnosed in
contaminated areas, amounted to a conspiracy.
   ``The explosion immediately made very many people at many levels
guilty, said Adamovich, a member of the national parliament. ``The
reflex of underestimating the scope of the disaster worked in all
of them because, if the scope is greater, their guilt is greater.''
   A Ukrainian lawmaker said doctors joined the coverup, refusing
to register illnesses and deaths as Chernobyl-related and blaming
``radiophobia'' instead.
   ``They lied,'' said Yuri N. Scherbak, chairman of a
parliamentary committee on Chernobyl. ``They said there would be no
effects. They said all is good, all is perfect; and now we are
beginning gradually, and probably not fully yet, to learn the
truth, that not everything is so good.''
   Medical reports show leukemia, thyroid gland malfunctions,
cancer and anemia are spreading, especially among children.
   No nationwide figures were available, but an unreleased report
obtained by The Associated Press shows worsening health problems
among children in the Vetka region.
   In 1986, there were five cases of aplastic anemia, marked by low
counts of platelets needed for clotting and of white blood cells to
fight infection. By last year, the number was 114.
   Cases of iron-deficiency anemia rose in the same period from 134
to 341 and cases of swollen thyroid glands doubled, from 763 in
1986 to 1,508 in 1989.
   Debate has begun over what radiation level is safe. The
government contends a person can be exposed safely to 35 REMs over
his life, But specialists testified before Scherbak's committee
that the standard does not account for long-term effects of small
radiation doses.
   Virtually all American nuclear power plants limit exposure to 5
REMs a year, according to the U.S. Council for Energy Awareness, an
industry group.
   Aside from human costs, Chernobyl is taking a huge toll on the
Soviet budget.
   New Chernobyl cleanup estimates are 30 times the original figure
of 8 billion rubles ($13 billion at the official rate of exchange).
Scherbak said surveys by the three republics affected indicate the
cost could reach 250 billion rubles ($405 billion) in the next
decade.
   In Vetka, a new communications center and three apartment houses
are being built. For whom?
   ``I asked a party secretary once, and he said we must think
about future generations. But basically, it's mismanagement, an
inability to plan,'' said Vetka councilman Oleg S. Gromyko.
   Corruption also takes a toll. The Soviet prosecutor's office has
reported ``criminal disregard for the rules of radiation safety,
distortions in reported data on medical aid, embezzlements, as well
as violations of the rules of paying compensation.''
   Press reports said some officials used Chernobyl cleanup money
for a sea cruise.
   Izvestia, the government newspaper, reported in October that
contaminated meat was mixed with ``clean'' meat at a packing plant
and made into sausage.

   Gene Young is 39 and a professor at
Jackson State University. But give him an instant, and he is 19
again, a student on the same campus, and gripped by fear.
   He hears again repeated rifle blasts shattering the
shirt-sleeve-mild night air. He remembers the screaming and crying.
He can see the broken glass, and the blood.
   And Young remembers first word that a Jackson State College
student had been killed as police in riot gear fired on a cluster
of students gathered in front of a women's dormitory to protest the
Vietnam war and the deaths 10 days earlier of four Kent State
University students.
   A high school student who was crossing the campus was also
fatally wounded.
   Classes were dismissed, commencement was canceled and most
students left for home, but Young, a Jackson native, stayed on the
inner-city campus several days. ``I felt something had to be
done,'' he recalled in an interview.
   What Young did was convince city high school students they
should boycott classes until after Phillip L. Gibbs, 21, and James
Earl Green, 17, were buried.
   Young said he is still trying to figure out what happened.
   ``To this day, I don't know what could have precipitated that
kind of violence,'' said Young, a professor of speech and dramatic
arts.
   The night of May 14, 1970, was the third in a row of campus
demonstrations and off-campus disturbances at mostly black Jackson
State. Students were agitated and upset about the shootings at Kent
State, which occurred when National Guardsmen fired on a crowd of
anti-war demonstrators.
   Students also were fed up with the racial epithets shouted from
cars by white West Jackson residents who drove straight through the
Jackson State campus on busy Lynch Street to reach downtown.
   ``The atmosphere was very charged,'' recalled John A. Peoples
Jr., president of Jackson State from 1967 to 1984. ``But I had,
from the very beginning, given the students a lot of freedom.''
   He and Young blamed racial intolerance for the shootings. The
city's and state's white officials ``never wanted black students to
demonstrate,'' Peoples asserted.
   Young concurred. ``Mississippi went to a great extent to show
how they would keep niggers in line if they were disorderly,'' he
said.
   Young also believes the Jackson State shootings would largely
have been ignored if not for what happened at Kent State.
   ``We know the history of blacks being victimized by whites in
Mississippi,'' he said. ``Had the incident not occurred a week
after Kent State, it would have been all but forgotten.
   ``Over the years that has been borne out. People remember Kent
State, but they don't remember Jackson State.''
   The night Gibbs and Green were killed, 22 police officers in
full riot gear advanced on the students milling outside the
Alexander Residence Center. Some reports counted 75 to 100 students
in front of the dormitory. Police said the number was closer to 400.
   A voice on a bullhorn ordered students to disperse. Then the
shooting began.
   In 25 seconds, Gibbs and Green were killed and seven others had
been wounded. An FBI report counted 275 holes in the west wing of
yellow-brick Alexander Hall; 21 were believed caused by automatic
weapons, 250 or more by shotgun buckshot. Every window on the
street side of the five-story building was blown out.
   ``Their intent was not just to disperse the crowd, but to bring
death and destruction,'' Young said. ``It amazes me that no more
people were killed.''
   That night's demonstrations had begun after students were drawn
outside to watch firefighters douse a burning dump truck on an
adjacent street.
   City and state officers were called to the scene after
firefighters were pelted with rocks and bottles, thrown, some say,
by neighborhood residents.
   ``Whatever the students started, the `corner boys' took up,''
Peoples said. ``At night, you couldn't tell the corner boys from
the students.''
   Officers claimed they opened fire after a sniper shot from a
dormitory window and a Highway Patrol officer was hit by an object
thrown from the crowd.
   To that, Young commented, ``The elusive sniper always amazes me,
how he gets around the world.''
   And students suggested at the time that what police took to be a
gunshot might have been the sound of a soft drink bottle smashing
on a sidewalk after it was dropped from a dorm window by a student
who saw the advancing officers.
   Families of the dead and injured sued the city of Jackson and
the state of Mississippi, but a federal appeals court ruled in 1974
that damages could not be awarded because it was impossible to
determine who was to blame.
   However, the court did say that ``the barrage of gunfire far
exceeded the response that was appropriate.''
   The President's Commission on Campus Unrest said police had
fired blindly into the students and no evidence was found of any
sniper. The commission said the blame lay jointly with public
officials, students and college administratiors.
   ``I didn't think anyone would be punished for it in the first
place,'' Nureen Gibbs Ray, sister of Phillip Gibbs, said from her
home in Ripley. ``They said there was an investigation, but I don't
think there was ever anything concrete.''
   Gibbs was a junior pre-law student. He had a pregnant wife and
child back home in Ripley. His wife has since remarried, changed
her children's last name, and lives in Arizona.
   Green was a track star at Jim Hill High School. He was crossing
the Jackson campus after getting off work.
   Ray said Gibbs had called her that night to let her know about
the disturbances on campus but said he and their sister, Mary, also
a Jackson State student, would be leaving for home soon. The
siblings' parents both were dead.
   ``His car already was packed. He had gone up to get our sister
because they were coming home,'' Ray said.
   Mary, she said, lives in Chicago and doesn't like to talk about
that night.
   Dr. Roland Colom, a Columbus dentist, attended junior high with
Gibbs and was his roomate at Jackson State. ``It was really strange
for me to hear that he was out there (amid the demonstrators)
because I was out there the night before and tried to get him to go
out and he wouldn't,'' Colom said.
   Jackson State has grown from 3,700 students in 1970 to more than
7,150 today, 93 percent of them black. Lynch Street, the
thoroughfare that once split the campus, is closed, replaced by a
plaza in front of the Alexander complex.
   After several years of commemorating the shootings, the
ceremonies stopped. But Young is head of a committee planning a
special 20th anniversary program next month.
   Young said he's satisfied that race relations in Mississippi
have improved, but he doesn't believe the state has ever repented
for the shootings.
   ``No one has ever apologized,'' he said. ``In that regard,
Mississippi still bears the guilt of that incident.''

   Here is a brief review of the Chernobyl nuclear
accident and its aftermath:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ACCIDENT _ On April 26, 1986, a fire started in one of the
four 1,000-megawatt reactors of the nuclear power station at
Chernobyl, 80 miles north of Kiev, captial of the Ukraine. A core
meltdown and explosion followed, sending huge quantities of
radiation into the atmosphere. The Soviets did not report the
accident until two days later, after Scandinavian complaints of
unsually high radiation levels.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   EVACUATION _ About 116,000 people were evacuated from
contaminated parts of the Ukraine and Byelorussia, most from a
9-mile radius of the plant. A pass is required to enter the area.
Last year, the government decided to evacuate 85 more villages in
Byelorussia, 31 in Russia and 14 in the Ukraine.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   DEATHS _ Two people were killed in the accident and 29 are
officially reported to have died of radiation sickness later. Yuri
Scherbak, a Ukrainian member of the national parliament, and others
say up to 250 have died. An official report commissioned in 1986
estimated 5,300 people would die over 70 years from cancer
resulting from radiation exposure.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   COST _ Current estimates of cleanup costs are 30 times the
original $8 billion rubles ($13 billion at the official exchange
rate). Surveys by the three republics affected indicate the cost
may reach 250 billion rubles ($405 billion) over the next decade.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   PLANS FOR CHERNOBYL _ The Ukrainian legislature decided this
year that the plant, whose other three reactors are still
functioning, should be closed by 1995. Specialists say shutting it
down may take up to 10 years.

   Earth Day turned 20 this month in a
national frenzy of environmental excess, observed for weeks in
song, dance, meditation, exultation and exhortation. On its heels
comes Arbor Day.
   Remember Arbor Day? A tradition started in 1872, it is one of
the oldest formalized conservation observances in the world. Its
occasion has resulted in the planting of millions of trees in this
country through 10 generations.
   ``God also said, `I give you all plants that bear seed
everywhere on Earth, and every tree bearing fruit which yields
seed; they shall be yours for food.''' The author of Genesis knew
the importance of trees.
   But not since the legend of Johnny Appleseed tagged after John
Chapman, a Massachusetts farmer who gave up the plow to sow
orchards from the Allegheny Mountains to Indiana after the
Revolution, has tree planting become so trendy.
   ``A tree planted today can enrich the lives of generations yet
unborn,'' President Bush said March 22 when he planted an eastern
red bud on the White House lawn. ``So let us plant the trees and
nurture them so that America will remain America the beautiful for
generations to come.''
   Bush then mused that John Quincy Adams planted am elm on the
White House grounds in 1826. That Andrew Jackson's magnolia is
among the first to bloom each spring. That Woodrow Wilson's family
picnicked amid a grove of bay trees.
   Franklin D. Roosevelt planted a little-leaf linden for Britain's
King George VI, and Herbert Hoover and Dwight Eisenhower, both
Midwesterners, left their arboreal legacy in oaks. Bush's
grandchildren now swing on Ike's sturdy tree.
   Bush, who wants to plant a tree in every state, last April
personally turned the dirt for an offspring of the Adams elm on the
grounds of the North Dakota capitol in Bismarck.
   But before the presidential spade tapped down the roots,
horticulturalists had to take emergency action against gypsy moth
larvae that had taken a free ride from Washington amid the 12-foot
sapling's branches.
   The president's North Dakota tree is now thriving, according to
S.F. ``Buckshot'' Hoffner, executive director of the North Dakota
Centennial Commission. The elms Bush planted in South Dakota and
Montana for those states' centennials last year are also budding.
   On April 3, Bush planted another elm in Indianapolis and
dedicated it to the comatose Ryan White, the teen-ager with AIDS
who died five days later.
   But Bush is not tackling his goal single-handedly. In his 1990
budget, he asked Congress for $175 million to plant 1 billion
trees. He has called on fellow citizens to plant 10 billion trees
by the beginning of the century. In time, he said, those trees
would annually absorb 13 million tons of carbon dioxide, 5 percent
of nationwide emissions.
   Global ReLeaf, a project of the American Forestry Association,
plans to plant 100 million trees in the United States by 1992. A
private U.S.-Soviet venture plans to plant fruit trees along the
coast of Nicaragua.
   Scrambling to get on the bandwagon, corporations are lining up
to help the U.S. Forest Service with its National Tree Planting
Initiative.
   Texaco, for one, has pledged $1 million to nurture new woods
being planted this year by volunteers in Houston, New Orleans and
Denver.
   Scientists say woodlands restoration comes none too soon. Over
centuries, agriculture has done in nearly half of the Earth's
original forestland. Every year, tropical rain forests the size of
Tennessee disappear under the machete and the bulldozer. Experts
say football field-sized stands of trees are mowed down somewhere
in the world every 3 seconds.
   Arbor Day, as with most great causes, began as one person's
vision and became an official holiday long before ecology was a
buzz word.
   In 1854, Julius Sterling Morton, son of a wealthy New York
merchant, left the cultured East with his bride of a few hours and
headed for the Nebraska Territory. They settled on a treeless
160-acre homestead outside Nebraska City, 40 miles south of Omaha
on the Missouri River.
   Just 3 percent of the vast Territory was wooded. Fierce prairie
fires and roaming buffalo made trees so scarce they became
landmarks, such as ``travel two days until you get to the tree.''
It is claimed that Lone Tree, Neb., was named for a single huge
cottonwood on the Ox Bow Trail.
   Nebraska-born author Willa Cather in ``My Antonia'' described
the Czech farm girl, Antonia, showing a friend her farm north of
Red Cloud:
   ``As we walked through the apple orchard ... Antonia kept
stopping to tell me about one tree or another. `I love them as if
they were people,' she said rubbing her hand over the bark. `There
wasn't a tree here when we first came. We planted every one and
used to carry water for them, too ...' There was the deepest peace
in that orchard.''
   J. Sterling Morton resolved to change the landscape. He and his
wife, Carrie, planted their own apple orchard. At the state fair in
1869, Morton and 22 other men organized the Nebraska State
Horticultural Society.
   On Jan. 4, 1872, Morton presented his ``Fruit Address'' to his
colleagues, urging them to plant trees:
   ``Orchards are missionaries of culture and refinement. They make
the people among whom they grow a better and more thoughtful
people. If every farmer in Nebraska will ... cultivate an orchard
and a flower garden, together with a few forest trees, this will
become mentally and morally the best agricultural state, the
grandest community of producers in the American union.''
   And it was done. The Nebraska Board of Agriculture declared
April 10 that year to be Arbor Day. On that first observance, more
than 1 million trees were planted in Nebraska. Astonishingly, as
many as 100 million trees were planted annually in that prairie
state from 1885 to 1890.
   By 1900, Arbor Day was celebrated in every state and the idea
had spread overseas. As the tree-planting ritual became a fixture
in the American school year, Morton declared, ``Other holidays
repose upon the past; Arbor Day proposes for the future.''

   Today National Arbor Day is the last Friday in April, although
many states plan observances to coincide with the planting season:
South Carolina's Arbor Day is the first Friday in December, while
Alaska deems the third Monday in May auspicious.
   Exactly 100 years after Morton first exhorted his colleagues
about planting more trees, John Rosenow _ born, fittingly, in
Elmwood, Neb. _ was asked by then-Gov. James J. Exon to plan the
state's Arbor Day centennial.
   Rosenow, the new tourism director, was only 21 and fresh from
the University of Nebraska when he accepted the task. He started
the National Arbor Day Foundation with $10,000 and a staff of one _
himself.
   Today, almost 900,000 members make the foundation second only to
the National Wildlife Federation as the nation's largest
environmental organization. Members pay $10 to join, $15 annual
dues thereafter, and receive, free of charge, 10 seedlings from 6
to 12 inches, in varieties suited to climate. More than 40 million
trees have been given away since 1972.
   Rosenow, now 40, the foundation's executive director since 1979,
has spent half his life guiding it into an international
environmental force. He has a theory on its success: ``The magic of
planting a tree and caring for it is something each and every
person can do to make a difference. It empowers people the same way
a spark can light a bonfire.''
   ``Often that experience comes in childhood,'' he said, ``and it
can touch off a tremendous, latent desire in people to make a
positive contribution to the world they live in.''
   When Christ walked the Earth, many forest-dwellers believed gods
lived in trees. The Gauls worshiped oak. Sacred trees guarded
entrances to Chinese villages. Egyptians left offerings of raisins
to sycamores. American Indians believed each tree had its own
spirit.
   ``When you think about tree rings, you have to have sense of
reverence,'' said Rosenow. ``A 4,000-year-old sequoia may be
one-third as old as civilization itself.''
   Tree-huggers everywhere know the ditty by Joyce Kilmer:
   ``I think that I shall never see
   A poem lovely as a tree ...
   Poems are made by fools like me,
   But only God can make a tree.''
   Recite it on Arbor Day as you dig the hole. And then commit
this, a poem entitled ``An Arbor Day Tree,'' author unknown, to
memory:
   ``Dear Little tree that we plant today,
   What will you be when we're old and gray?
   The saving bank of the squirrel and mouse,
   For the robin and wren an apartment house.
   The dressing room of the butterfly's ball,
   The locust's and katydid's concert hall.
   The schoolboy's ladder in pleasant June,
   The schoolgirl's tent in the July moon.
   And my leaves shall whisper right merrily
   A tale of children who planted me.''

   President Bush, to hear some Democrats tell
it, doesn't make a move without checking public opinion polls first
_ and even then he acts timidly.
   Republicans, along with a number of political analysts, counter
that Bush is getting a bum rap on the issue. Even a few Democrats
say the same.
   ``I don't think he can be accused of governing by the polls any
more than any other modern president,'' said Democrat Stuart
Eizenstat, domestic affairs adviser to former President Jimmy
Carter.
   All presidents should be responsive to public moods, Eizenstat
said. ``A president, after all, is not a dictator.''
   Political scientist Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia,
said, ``I think (Bush) is more contemptuous of polls than either
(Ronald Reagan or Carter), less likely to trust them or to use them
in decision-making.''
   Thomas Cronin, presidential scholar at Colorado College, said,
``I think he reads them, just as any good president should. To say
he follows them constantly and is tied to them is wrong.''
   And John Sears, a Republican political consultant, said, ``By
general nature, Bush is cautious. I don't think that's because of
something he read in the polls.''
   Yet, even those who defend Bush say the president should risk
his high ratings occasionally to take a bold stand on a tough
issue, such as the federal deficit.
   ``The best use of presidential popularity is to achieve
something now rather than to husband it, because it could all
disappear overnight,'' Sabato said.
   ``An activist president would be putting this to work,'' Cronin
said. ``But Bush is a cautious president and moves more slowly. ...
I wish he would be leading more.''
   On the other hand, Sears said, ``No president is going to get
accused of making a terrible blunder by not doing very much.''
   Bush's supposed obsession with polls got a lot of attention when
House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, in a speech recently,
attacked the president as timid and unimaginative.
   ``The maxim of the Bush presidency seems to be: Do polls, risk
nothing,'' Gephardt said. He said Bush is running a government ``of
the polls, by the polls and for the polls.''
   In response, Bush said he's learned not to trust polls and
doesn't shape his decisions by them. ``That's not the way I try to
call the shots on the policy,'' he said.
   Robert Teeter, who conducts polls for the White House, called
Gephardt's accusation ``bunk.'' He said Bush is interested in the
results but ``is not a great poll fanatic.''
   ``There was no decision where we went out and did a poll to shed
some light on what we should do,'' he said.
   In the Reagan White House, a national sampling of public opinion
was conducted at least once a month and more frequently during
times of crisis, said Tom Griscom, who was Reagan's communications
chief.
   Teeter said he conducted only three or four polls for Bush last
year, usually at ``good summing-up times.'' They are done under the
auspices of the Republican National Committee.
   Teeter said he occasionally tags White House-related questions
onto other polls he does for the GOP. One polling source said such
questions are added to surveys every month.
   The RNC also plays a big role in helping the White House track
public moods, following all public polls, such as those done by the
media, as well as surveys taken by GOP organizations and candidates
throughout the country.
   A lot of the information is funneled to the White House.
   ``We share a lot of it with the political office over there'' at
the White House, said RNC spokesman B. J. Cooper.
   Teeter said Democrats, in criticizing Bush, are trying to
suggest he has no personal convictions, lacks ideas and is not a
strong leader.
   ``I don't know why it's wrong in a democracy to pay attention to
what the people want you to do,'' Teeter said.
   To the dismay of Democrats, Bush, after 14 months in office, has
the longest running set of high poll ratings of any president in a
quarter century.
   Bush's popularity shot up to 80 percent in January after the
invasion of Panama. Since then, it has tapered off to the high 60s
and low 70s _ still a lofty rating.
   ``It's peace, prosperity and the collapse of communism,'' said
political scientist Sabato.
   Gephardt has been prodding Bush to risk some of his popularity,
``to summon the nation to meet new challenges on the horizon.''
Other Democrats have issued similar challenges.
   Even the GOP's Sears said, ``I don't think they're missing the
mark.''
   ``If you look below the first level of the polls, people perhaps
don't think he's active enough,'' Sears said. ``In politics, it's
always a matter of `Compared to what?' There is no other
individual, no reaction by the opposition party, to fill in,
`What's the alternative?'''
   ``Where is the Democratic Party? Out to lunch,'' complained Duke
University political scientist James David Barber.
   Referring to Bush's high ratings, Eizenstat said, ``I think he's
just sitting on it.'' How does that help Bush? ``It gets him
re-elected,'' Eizenstat said.

   The Bush administration is proclaiming victory
with a new agreement to dismantle Japanese trade barriers. But
skeptics warn: ``Remember Townsend Harris.''
   Harris was the American consul general sent to Tokyo in 1856 to
implement the first U.S.-Japan market opening agreement. That deal,
struck by Commodore Matthew Perry, sought to end 300 years of
Japanese isolation and open the country to trade.
   But when Harris arrived, the Japanese at first wouldn't even let
him off his ship. In the end, all the issues that Perry thought had
been resolved wound up being renegotiated or simply ignored by the
Japanese.
   Now 134 years later, a debate is raging in Washington over
whether the latest market-opening pledge by the Japanese should be
viewed any differently than the countless agreements that went
before it.
   Skeptics, including numerous members of Congress, argue that
nothing fundamentally has changed and the new pact will do little
to lower America's huge $49 billion trade deficit with Japan.
   Supporters of the agreement, including President Bush, contend
that the new Structural Impediments Initiative does herald the dawn
of a new era in Japan. They believe Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu's
government is serious about harnessing consumer discontent to push
through fundamental changes in the way Japan operates.
   Whichever side is right, the SII talks, at least in their early
stages, seem eerily reminiscent of past negotiating ``triumphs.''
   Interminable discussions take place with the Japanese resisting
what they term exhorbitant American demands. The Japanese finally
make grudging concessions, but only at the 11th hour when faced
with a threat of economic retaliation from an outraged Congress.
   In past deals, the Japanese later disputed America's
interpretation of the commitments and the U.S.-Japanese deficit
climbed ever higher.
   The new deal seeks to attack broadbased structural barriers to
trade. It proposes to expand opportunities for American and other
foreign companies to do business in Japan by eliminating red tape
and by breaking down the cozy relationships that exist between
Japanese companies.
   The administration believes the pact is historic in the number
of commitments obtained from the Japanese. But veterans of past
negotiations say many of the items were addressed in earlier
market-opening efforts undertaken by the Reagan administration.
   ``These talks are a dangerous charade. They are always presented
as a final solution to the problem when in reality they are about
Act 25 in a long-running play,'' says Clyde Prestowitz, a top trade
negotiator in the Reagan administration. ``We keep claiming
victory, victory, victory and nothing much happens.''
   Among the previous agreements cited by Prestowitz and others:
   _Five ``market-access packages'' issued by the Japanese
government from 1981 to 1984. They covered a wide range of products
but produced few tangible results in increased U.S. sales. Often,
the Japanese concessions repeated changes which had been promised
in earlier packages but never implemented.
   _The 1985 MOSS Talks, for Market-Oriented Sector Selective. They
were designed to address broad-based barriers in four specific
industries _ forest products, medical equipment, pharmaceuticals
and electronic products. Wags dubbed the discussions ``More of the
Same Stuff'' because the Japanese repeated the pattern of offering
lower trade barriers but failing to fully implement them. One of
the areas, forest products, is currently the subject of intense
bargaining as negotiators replow ground supposedly covered five
years ago.
   _The 1986 Maekawa Report, named for former Bank of Japan
President Haruo Maekawa, called for broad structural change in
Japan. The report was issued the same year that the Reagan
administration was engaged in the Structural Dialogue discussions,
attempting to reconcile the differences in economic systems between
the United States and Japan. These talks, following the pattern of
a 1983-84 series of discussions, degenerated into an examination of
vague macroeconomic principles. Some trade experts see these talks
as very similar to the current SII discussions.
   And the result so far from all of this torrent of words? The
U.S.-Japan trade deficit, which totaled what seemed an alarming
$15.8 billion in 1981, stood at $49 billion in 1989, representing
three-fourths of America's non-oil trade deficit.
   It is this outcome that has contributed to widespread cynicism
on Capitol Hill over the new trade agreement.
   Senate Finance Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, likened Japan's
negotiating efforts to a drugstore cowboy _ ``all hat and no
cattle.'' House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., dismissed
the SII agreement as an exchange of press releases.
   The administration insists that things are different this time
around, noting recent polls showing that Japanese consumers, who
currently pay prices up to 70 percent higher than American
consumers, want reforms to open up competition in their country.
   ``We think we have a very good blueprint for action and we got a
good down payment,'' said U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills.
   However, some members of Kaifu's Liberal Democratic Party have
warned that if the Japanese leader pushes too far with the reforms
it could topple his government.
   Already, politically powerful groups representing Japan's 2
million small retail stores have come out strongly against one key
element of the agreement that would reduce the time it takes to
open large retail stores from as much as 10 years down to 1.5 years.
   Many members of Congress are urging the administration to keep
the pressure on Japan by citing Tokyo for a second year as an
unfair trader under a tough section of the 1988 trade act that
provides for economic sanctions if barriers are not removed.
   The administration, which has until April 30 to issue its new
trade ``hit list,'' has refused to say whether Japan will be on it.
   The structural barriers report issued on April 4 was only an
interim agreement. The final report is due in July and many in the
American business community believe that it must contain language
spelling out how the commitments will be monitored and enforced if
the talks are to produce a turning point in U.S.-Japan relations.
   But at least some private economists are encouraged.
   ``You don't change a society overnight, but it would be
erroneous to say nothing has changed,'' said C. Fred Bergsten, head
of the Institute for International Economics, a Washington-based
research group.

<HEAD>Bank Stocks in the Depths</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Today's tip for stock-market anglers: If you
want to go ``bottom fishing'' right now, try the banks.
   In a generally stagnant market over the past several months, few
industry groups have sunk so low as the shares of banking
institutions _ especially those of the big international banks and
many regionals operating in the eastern part of the country.
   In the 12-month period ended in mid-April, Dow Jones's index of
eastern regional banks dropped 33.86 percent, to rank dead last
among 82 stock groups tracked by the financial publishing company.
   ``Money center'' banks in New York and other centers of
international banking activity didn't fare much better, running No.
68 with an 11.45 percent decline.
   There is a long and well-publicized list of reasons for the
stocks' depressed state, of course. Industry profits have been
riddled by bad loans to foreign countries, to high-risk companies
and to real-estate ventures gone sour.
   The question now up for debate among Wall Street analysts is
whether the worst is still to come for the stocks _ or whether the
pessimists on the group might have gone overboard.
   ``Bank earnings are experiencing a recession even if the U.S.
economy is not,'' says Arthur Soter, an analyst at Morgan Stanley &amp;
Co., in a current report on the industry. ``We expect disappointing
earnings to persist a while longer before beginning to look up
later this year.''
   Some rude surprises were in store for anyone who started
speculating a few months ago on the prospect of an eventual banking
recovery.
   Last week, for example, there was the news that Moody's
Investors Services was reviewing its ratings of some of the debt of
Citicorp, one of the nation's biggest bank holding companies.
   In another development earlier in April, statements from federal
regulators raised the specter of a long and stringent crackdown on
bank lending practices.
   In that kind of climate, ``many banks seem to be bending
backwards to avoid making any type of loan they might live to
regret,'' said analyst Theresa Brophy in the latest appraisal of
the industry by the Value Line Investment Survey.
   ``With commercial loan demand soft and real estate lending
off-limits to many banks, very profitable consumer lending is
getting a lot more emphasis,'' she added. ``Unfortunately, there's
just so much consumer loan demand to go around.''
   As ``cheap'' as bank stocks may be, Value Line rates them no
better than 87th out of 96 groups it follows for likely performance
over the next 12 months.
   ``Bank earnings, which fell sharply in 1989, aren't likely to be
especially strong in 1990,'' the firm said. ``Sources of revenue
seem to be drying up. Meanwhile, it's unclear whether problem loans
have topped out or not _ more reserves may be needed for loan
losses.''
   Similary, Cheryl Swaim, who follows banks for Oppenheimer &amp; Co.,
urges a cautious approach.
   ``Even though the stocks are down already, we believe good news
is necessary to drive them higher,'' she said. ``Furthermore, it
will take time to turn around the troubled real estate market.''
   Soter at Morgan Stanley takes a more venturesome view. ``We
believe the pressure of tighter regulatory supervision will induce
bank managements to flush out problem credits faster than they
otherwise would, penalizing 1990 earnings but reducing
uncertainties,'' he said.
   ``We believe the stock market has largely, if not completely,
discounted the underlying reality of bank loan portfolios.
   ``In general, we believe bank stocks are bottoming and pose much
less downside risk than the overall stock market.''

<HEAD>Inflation, Rate Worries Trip Up Stocks Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Renewed inflation and interest-rate worries are
threatening to spoil the view as Wall Street looks ahead to
mid-1990 and beyond.
   To judge from the latest inflation statistics, a long spell of
sluggish growth in the economy has not yet subdued upward pressures
on the cost of living enough to satisfy the Federal Reserve Board.
   Bond traders, who often match or exceed the Fed in their
anti-inflationary zeal, have wasted no time in recent days
registering their displeasure with the way things are shaping up.
   The result has been a new rise in interest rates that has
dampened hopes for an improvement in business activity and
corporate profits as 1990 progresses.
   The government provided the latest reference point in the debate
over the inflation outlook this past week when it reported that the
consumer price index rose 0.5 percent in March.
   That put the increase in the CPI for the first quarter of 1990
at an 8.5 percent annual rate _ a figure that sat well with hardly
anybody in the financial world.
   Optimistic analysts quickly issued assurances that inflation
wasn't likely to keep up that pace for long. Among battered bond
investors, the attitude seemed to be ``it had better not.''
   Interest rates on long-term Treasury bonds climbed close to 9
percent, hitting their highest levels in almost a year.
   ``Unfortunately, as we see it, the risks to inflation remain
very much on the upside,'' said Stephen Roach, economist at Morgan
Stanley &amp; Co.
   With worries like that to contend with, the stock market
suffered a broad setback in the past week. The Dow Jones average of
30 industrials, which had risen 47.52 points over the three
previous weeks, tumbled 55.85 to 2,695.95.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 4.74 to 184.06;
the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market lost
10.52 to 425.79, and the American Stock Exchange market value index
was down 9.92 at 347.96.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 149.02 million shares a day,
against 133.63 million the week before.
   To some observers, talk of revived inflation still represents a
red herring, distracting investors from problems capable of causing
very different kinds of mischief.
   The banking system, for one thing, is undergoing a squeeze on
lending that hardly paints a picture of an ``overheating'' economy.
   There's nothing inflationary, they add, about the depressed
state of the real estate market in many areas of the country.
   Analysts at Wright Investors' Service in Bridgeport, Conn.,
voiced some doubts about the elements of the March consumer price
data showing higher prices for houses and clothing.
   ``These increases do not square with the weak trends in retail
sales and housing construction,'' Wright said. ``Furthermore,
March's CPI does not reflect the latest round of weakness in oil
prices.''
   But Roach says the inflation outlook doesn't get much brighter
if you exclude fluctuations in prices of energy and food to
calculate a ``core'' inflation rate, which was up 0.7 percent in
March after climbing 1.1 percent in the first two months of the
year.
   Looking at the numbers minus food and energy makes sense, Roach
maintains, ``not because food and energy are unimportant, but
because their variations are typically driven by forces outside the
economic sphere _ reflecting trends in weather, politics and the
like.
   ``The March report hardly offered the break in core inflation
that we were anticipating,'' he concluded. ``We think the CPI
report is a clear warning shot.''

   For 20 years, Alan Hackel depended on his bank to
supply a credit line that was the lifeblood of his distributing
business.
   He would use loans to buy furniture and other merchandise from
manufacturers and would repay the debt with money he made by
selling the items to retailers, hotels and restaurants.
   But that arrangement came unglued several months ago when the
bank told Hackel he would have to find a new lender.
   ``I was never late on a payment _ not even close,'' Hackel said.
``All of a sudden one day, they come to us and say they can no
longer maintain our loan.''
   Such scenes have become more common across New England in recent
months, business leaders say. Small companies are suddenly finding
their credit cut off, as banks feel pressure from financial losses
and government scrutiny.
   To a large extent this reflects a tightening of the banking
industry nationwide. Last week, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan said a majority of banks have become much less willing to
make loans, due to the weakening economy, rising numbers of bad
loans and closer scrutiny by bank regulators.
   But the impact is particularly acute in economically depressed
New England, and some experts say it threatens to make the
situation worse. They have trouble agreeing on who is responsible.
   Some point to bankers who have grown more cautious after getting
burned by aggressive real estate lending. Others blame regulators
for excessive toughness after witnessing banking debacles in the
Southwest.
   ``At the precise time that the economy is getting soggy, banks
are forced to become stingy,'' said Gary Ciminero, chief economist
for Fleet Norstar Financial Group in Providence, R.I. ``This bridge
across troubled waters, namely credit availability, is being pulled
away.''
   Figures from the Fed reflect how credit has decayed. From 1984
to 1988, when New England was enjoying an economic boom, commercial
and industrial lending in the region more than doubled to above $38
billion.
   Since then, the economy has stumbled and taken the lending with
it. The most recent figures available, from the middle of last
year, show a decline of 2 percent.
   Experts say small businesses have suffered the brunt of the
credit crunch, because they tend to rely more heavily on bank loans
for daily operations.
   ``If you're trying to expand and all of a sudden you find things
are shut off, it's a time of tremendous difficulty for a small
company,'' said Lewis Shattuck, president of the Small Business
Association of New England. ``There's a lot of anxiety out there.''
   Hackel, who employs a dozen people at R.R. Scheibe Co. in
Brockton, was well acquainted with the feelings of anxiety.
   ``If you want to talk about mental anguish and sleepless nights
and recurring ulcers, I think I asked myself many times what my
options were,'' he said.
   Hackel finally found a bank that would pick up his credit line _
but only at $400,000 rather than the $700,000 he previously had
been granted.
   ``It's probably going to make me watch my pennies a lot more
carefully,'' he said.
   Dozens of other business owners are similar positions. John
Gould, president of Associated Industries of Massachusetts, said
his group has found 154 small- and medium-size companies hurt by
credit shortages. In some cases, the credit has been lowered, in
others it has been eliminated.
   Gould and other business leaders aim their wrath at what they
call suddenly overzealous regulators. But the regulators say the
rising number of troubled loans is due to difficult economic times,
not unusually stringent standards.
   ``It's not like we reached into a hat and decided to crack down
on these guys,'' said Frank Vance, a spokesman for the U.S.
comptroller of the currency.
   Some economists also question how much the economy is further
harmed by the withdrawal of credit.
   ``The economy is like a giant ship _ it's tough to turn it
around,'' said Gerard Cassidy, an analyst at Tucker Anthony Inc.
``Let's say they let all the marginal developers have money; I
would say there would still be serious economic problems in New
England.''

   When Johnson Controls Inc. sought to hide
development of a $20 million next-generation building automation
system, it started a diversion campaign to dupe a leading
competitor, Honeywell Inc.
   Johnson Controls took a slight modification of an existing
product and promoted it in a flashy advertising campaign.
   The tactic bought the company time to finalize its new building
automation system, which integrates computers and other digital
technology to control heating, security and other functions in
buildings.
   The Johnson Controls diversion is an example of how companies
often take extraordinary measures to protect their concepts,
blueprints and experiments. Alarms, guards, padlocks and patent
attorneys tell only part of the story.
   There's also a chess-game, cloak-and-dagger side to it as well,
with weapons that range from phony publicity to secret codes aimed
at throwing the other guy off your scent.
   Estimating how much those efforts cost is difficult.
   ``I don't think it's a budgetary thing.'' said Ronald J.
Caffrey, vice president for marketing at Johnson's controls group.
``You can't put up an electronic security fence. It's more of a
people thing.''
   Mike Bernaden, an advertising executive who devised Johnson
Control's diversion campaign, is a veteran in the trade secrets
field. He regularly scrutinizes visitors' name tags at at trade
shows and eliminates from Johnson Control mailing lists any
competitors posing as customers.
   ``Anytime you go to a trade show or are involved in any
communication activity, there's a certain recognition of your
competition and their attempts to get information,'' Bernaden said.
   Milwaukee-based Johnson Controls spent three years and $20
million developing the new Metasys automation system, which was
given the code name Loba, after the 19th century Russian
mathematician Nikolai Lobachevski.
   Although the company used the code and made all suppliers,
customers and employees swear to secrecy, Johnson Controls still
sensed Honeywell had learned a major development was in the works,
Bernaden said.
   Johnson Controls mulled introducing Metasys earlier than
planned, but didn't want to risk imperfections. So Bernaden
developed what he called a ``grand strategy'' to create a
smokescreen.
   He took the slightly modified product, called it Lobo for
Logical Option for Building Systems, and used a splashy news
release complete with helium balloons to promote it.
   The diversion received thorough coverage in trade publications,
distracted Honeywell and gave Johnson Controls time to finish
fine-tuning the Metasys system before it was unveiled at an Atlanta
trade show in February.
   Martin A. McDevitt, an analyst with the Milwaukee firm Cleary
Gull Reiland McDevitt &amp; Collopy, said Metasys probably would give
its creator a larger share of the $2 billion-a-year building
controls market. Johnson Controls and Honeywell now each control
about 30 percent of the market.
   Code names, confidentiality and clearance systems are among the
more obvious trade secret tactics. But some companies won't even
talk about how they throw off their competitors.
   ``For very obvious reasons, we, as a matter of practice, don't
discuss security and security methods,'' said George Jamison, a
spokesman for General Electric Co. in Fairfield, Conn.
   Sometimes trade-secret paranoia reaches levels that embarrasses
the companies themselves. In October 1987 for example, Eastman
Kodak Co. protested the enrollment of a student from Kodak's
arch-rival Fuji Photo Film Corp. at the University of Rochester's
business school. Many of the student's classmates would have been
Kodak employees enrolled at the school.
   Kodak's behavior caused an academic uproar. The company
apologized and withdrew its objection, but by then the Fuji
employee had decided to enroll elsewhere.
   Many companies have ethics codes forbidding employees from
actively trying to uncover competitors' trade secrets.
   Honeywell officials said its ethics policy kept it from snooping
in Johnson Controls' business during the Metasys affair, although
they knew something was developing.
   ``We actively instruct employees to treat competitive
information as the property of others, not to be solicited by
Honeywell employees,'' said Paul Towne, Honeywell's director of
corporate ethics.
   Ronald J. Caffrey, vice president for marketing at Johnson's
Controls, said fragments of information often slip out _ and it's
not unethical to hear them.
   ``Vendor salespeople like to make you think that their product
is being used by all kinds of important companies,'' Caffrey said.
``It's a fairly common thing to listen to vendors and just try to
piece together intelligence.''
   But it would be unethical to devise a scheme to uncover
information, he said.
   Much information slips out because companies must walk a fine
line between openness with customers and silence with competitors,
Caffrey said.
   Customers want to know developments in technology so they don't
have to worry about buying an obsolete product. That requires
public relations departments to be careful in releasing information.
   Protecting technology also can become a matter of national
security for companies working on defense projects, so the
government requires clearance systems through which to filter
information.
   Employees are given different levels of clearance on a
``need-to-know'' basis. Government officials conduct extensive
background checks before granting higher levels of clearance.
   ``They ask everybody you ever knew if you're a decent human,''
said Gregory A. Martin, a doctoral candidate studying electrical
engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
   For commercial technology, patents play a more important role in
protection.
   ``Companies are very aggressive in getting patents and they do
so early on,'' said Samuel R. Williamson, a patent attorney for
Bell Laboratories in New Jersey. ``To wait might mean that someone
else files first.''
   Minneapolis-based Cray Research Inc. has a less aggressive
approach to protection and patenting, said David Frasch, corporate
secretary and technology counsel.
   The supercomputer manufacturer's attorneys work closely with its
engineers to keep abreast of what needs to be protected and what
needs to be shared with customers, suppliers and other companies.
   ``Our philosophy is to identify what's meaningful and is
important to protect and not bag every invention that comes
along,'' Frasch said.

<HEAD>Big Airline Bankruptcy a Case Study in Why Trustees Are Appointed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When a federal judge seized Eastern Airlines and
appointed an outsider to run it, he did something unusual in
modern-day bankruptcies but quite common before the law was
overhauled 12 years ago.
   The action by Judge Burton Lifland this past week surprised many
bankruptcy attorneys and led some to speculate that these outside
managers, known as trustees, would be appointed in more bankruptcy
reorganizations.
   Lifland's order also amounted to a rebuke for Eastern's parent
company Texas Air Corp. and its chairman, Frank Lorenzo, who have
contended that they alone could salvage Eastern from death.
   The judge departed from a principle enshrined in a 1978 reform
of the federal bankruptcy code known as debtor-in-possession. It
takes for granted that the best managers for ailing companies are
the existing managers.
   The reform says only in rare circumstances, such as substantial
evidence of fraud or incompetence by management, should trustees
replace the people who supposedly know the most about the business
they're trying to save.
   ``The presumption is that the debtor in possession will stay in
place and manage the business,'' said Richard Gitlin, a Hartford,
Conn., bankruptcy attorney and past president of the American
Bankruptcy Institute. ``I think the fact a trustee has been
appointed in the Eastern case is very significant.''
   By contrast in earlier bankruptcy law, the presumption was that
the companies got into trouble partly because management didn't
know what it was doing and should be booted out.
   ``Prior to the reform, a trustee was appointed in every big
case,'' said Frank Kennedy, a retired University of Michigan law
professor and bankruptcy expert who played a major role in the 1978
overhaul passed by Congress.
   Part of the reason for the reform stemmed from the inability of
many trustees to operate the failing businesses they were entrusted
with salvaging. Under the old system, many trustees often were
political appointees who in many instances used their position for
personal gain.
   ``They would take a business, not understand the steps to take
in order to revitalize them, have an agenda to generate business
for themselves and many if not most of the businesses failed as a
result,'' said Neal D. Colton, a bankruptcy attorney with Dechert
Price &amp; Roads, a Philadelphia law firm.
   In some respects, that's the implication in Lifland's decision
to take Eastern away from Lorenzo and Texas and appoint veteran
airline manager Martin R. Shugrue to run it instead.
   Eastern has racked up enormous losses since a strike in March
1989 that stemmed in large part from union hatred of Lorenzo
management. Eastern says the strike drove the carrier into Chapter
11 bankruptcy proceedings.
   Since then, the management has hired replacement workers,
reorganized Eastern into a smaller airline and repeatedly revised
downward the amount of money it planned to repay unsecured
creditors, who are owed nearly $1 billion. Creditor willingness to
trust management turned to impatience and exasperation. Evidence
also surfaced that Texas Air had deliberately transferred Eastern
assets away to sister non-union carrier, Continental Airlines,
hurting Eastern's ability to survive. This was one of the
accusations made by the unions in their decision to strike.
   Lifland emphasized what he called management's inability to make
reliable business forecasts as part of the basis for his decision.
He also said Texas Air's treatment of Eastern suggested ``parental
neglect.''
   Kennedy said in the Eastern case, ``the court considered the
balance of equities and decided that in light of the unseemly
history of Eastern, its inability to deal with problems to the
satisfaction of unsecured creditors, it was time to get an
independent trustee in there.''
   Some bankruptcy trustee experts suggested Lifland waited much
too long to resolve what they called an intense union-management
conflict in the Eastern case that was central to the airline's
problems.
   ``This was very apparent in the Eastern bankruptcy. Deals that
could have been worked were impossible,'' said Gary Knostman,
president of the National Association of Bankruptcy Trustees and a
professional trustee himself.
   ``A trustee isn't fighting the personalty battles and can
normally get cooperation among groups much quicker,'' he said.
``I'm not criticizing Lorenzo's management. But let's face it. He
was not a popular subject with the mechanics and pilots. You get
that bad blood, it's hard to make deals work.''
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _Former junk bond financier Michael Milken, perhaps the
best-known figure of the 1980s era of easy money and Wall Street
excess, reached agreement with federal prosecutors to plead guilty
in connection with securities fraud charges, sources said. Milken,
who had insisted he was innocent for more than two years, was
expected to pay $600 million in fines and face a prison term.
   _A financial squeeze on banks appeared increasingly evident
because of souring real estate and Third World loans. Citicorp, the
nation's largest bank, reported a large loss and its credit-rating
faced review. Several other banks also reported losses or lower
profits, and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said a
majority of banks have tightened lending practices.
   _The trade deficit shrank in February to $6.49 billion, the
smallest gap in more than six years. But the drop reported by the
government was largely due to a decline in imports, and private
economists suggested it did not signal an increased foreign
appetite for U.S. goods, considered crucial to long-term
improvement in the U.S. trade balance.

   The plea bargain agreement by indicted financier
Michael Milken marks another stunning chapter in Wall Street's
financial scandals, which saw the fall of both the junk bond genius
and the empire he created.
   After a year of maintaining his innocence, Milken agreed Friday
to plead guilty to six felonies and pay $600 million in penalties
to settle government charges in the largest individual securities
fraud case in history.
   The former head of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s high-yield bond
department _ who parlayed the risky securities into a
multibillion-dollar business _ and two others had been named in a
sweeping federal fraud and racketeering indictment stemming from
the confessions of speculator Ivan Boesky.
   Boesky, who cooperated with the government in settling charges
that he ran a stock trading network based on illegal insider
information, fingered Milken and Drexel as key participants in his
schemes.
   Milken repeatedly said he would be vindicated at trial. But
after lengthy negotiations between prosecutors and his attorneys,
he agreed to the plea bargain.
   ``It's a big victory to get a plea to six felonies,'' said Alan
Bromberg, a securities law professor at Southern Methodist
University who has followed the Milken case closely. ``It's
certainly one up for the government over Wall Street.''
   For both sides, the deal also removes the risk and cost of the
lengthy jury trial that was expected over the charges.
   Milken is expected to enter the guilty plea to the felony counts
and agree to pay fines and restitution next week in U.S. District
Court in Manhattan, said individuals close to the case, who asked
not to be named.
   The sources cautioned that while a settlement had been reached
it would not be final until the plea formally is entered.
   Milken, his brother, Lowell, and former Drexel trader Bruce
Newberg were indicted last year on 98 counts of fraud and
racketeering related to insider trading and other alleged
securities violations in a series of takeover deals from 1985 to
1987.
   None of the counts in the plea bargain relates to insider
trading and there is no racketeering charge. As part of the deal,
the government agreed to drop all charges against Lowell Milken,
the sources said.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney John K. Carroll declined to comment on
the deal. A spokesman for Milken also declined to comment.
   It was unclear whether the government would recommend a specific
sentence to U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood. Milken would face a
maximum of up to 30 years in prison on the six felony counts. A
single racketeering count would have carried a 20-year sentence.
   But the government could recommend that Milken serve the counts
concurrently, for a maximum term of five years in prison.
   It also was unclear whether Milken would be forced to cooperate
with any further government investigations.
   The deal would settle separate civil charges brought by the
Securities and Exchange Commission in 1988. The sources said the
$600 million in penalties would be split between criminal fines and
a fund for payment of any civil lawsuits related to Milken's
activities.
   Milken, 43, is widely acknowledged as one of the most important
financial figures of the 1980s.
   Milken is credited with reshaping corporate America by
pioneering the widespread use of high-yield bonds, which offer high
interest payments to compensate for the risky nature of the
companies that issue them.
   The so-called junk bonds were used to finance growth for
hundreds of companies and fed a wave of hostile corporate takeovers
in the 1980s.
   Milken was paid handsomely for his work _ receiving $1 billion
from 1983-87, including $550 million in 1987 alone.
   But Drexel collapsed in February, partly due to the long-ranging
impact of its decision to plead guilty to six felonies and pay a
record $650 million to settle its own case.
   The Milken settlement marks a complete change of course. He had
pleaded innocent to the original charges and had said he would take
the case to trial.
   Since handing up the March 1989 indictment, the government
repeatedly delayed a promised superseding indictment.
   The new charges were said to include allegations separate from
information provided by Boesky to strengthen the case. Boesky, who
pleaded guilty to a single felony count in November 1986 and paid a
$100 million fine, was considered an easy target for defense
lawyers.
   Drexel's own plea bargain allowed it to avoid a racketeering
indictment that could have put the firm out of business.
   But the brokerage, which grew from a second-tier player to a
powerhouse on Wall Street largely because of Milken's prowess,
never recovered from its plea deal and the sharp decline of the
junk bond market beginning last fall. It has been liquidating since
filing for bankruptcy court protection in February.
   Drexel was forced to sever ties with Milken under terms of its
SEC settlement. Milken resigned from Drexel last June to set up his
own consulting and investing firm.

   When Michael Milken pleaded innocent to 98
counts of fraud and racketeering a y Release Sunday ear ago, supporters
donned caps
reading ``Mike Milken We Believe in You'' and cheered wildly as he
exited Manhattan federal court.
   Milken always has believed in himself, so his decision to
reverse course, plead guilty to six felonies and pay $600 million
in penalties was a stunning event.
   The move reflected the government's power and the pressure of
more than three years at the center of Wall Street's scandal.
   ``There was no end in sight,'' a friend of Milken's said after
the plea deal was revealed. ``The physical and the emotional toll
was just spectacular.''
   Milken in many ways was the Damocles of Wall Street, creating
and then ruling the junk bond market that drove the boom years of
the 1980s, bu the outcome leaves many issues
unresolved. Milken's and many other Wall Street fraud cases relied
on gray areas of the law. Plea bargains leave legal matters no
clearer.
   ``We never had a full development of the facts and we never had
a court ruling that of these things were illegal,'' Bromberg said.
``All we have is somebody saying, `I give up.'''
   ``All that is very unsatisfying in wanting to know what really
happened and what the law is on all these points,'' he said.
   Milken, the California-bred son of an accountant, parlayed a
novel idea about an obscure kind of debt into the gear that turned
American finance in the 1980s. His work made him the highest paid
man in one year in American history: $550 million in 1987.
   Milken has said he would rather be remembered for helping
companies that needed financing unavailable from conventional
sources, such as commercial banks or the high-grade corporate debt
market, and for his extensive charitable activities.
   But in all likelihood history will remember Milken more for his
legal travails that focused on allegations of widespread insider
trading and other fraudulent activity.
   Milken's plea bargain does not include any counts related to
insider trading, and likely will not even involve any junk-bond
financed deals. People familiar with the deal said it also would
preclude any further investigations of Milken associates.
   Milken helped create Wall Street's phenomenal growth in the last
decade, receiving a notoriety he never sought before becoming the
target of the largest financial investigation in history.
   Born on the Fourth of July in 1946, Milken grew up in Encino,
Calif. As a boy, he helped his father prepare tax returns for
clients.
   Milken graduated from the University of California at Berkeley,
majoring in business administration, and married his high-school
sweetheart, Lori Anne Hackel. He went on to the University of
Pennsylvania's Wharton School.
   As an undergraduate, Milken was influenced by a study published
in the 1950s by an academician named W. Braddock Hickman. The study
postulated that a diversified investment portfolio of high-interest
bonds of risky companies with low credit ratings could be
profitable because returns would amply make up for defaults.
   Milken applied the theory when he was hired fulltime by Drexel's
bond-trading department in 1970 after working in its Philadelphia
office during business school.
   A rapid success, Milken generated sizable profits for the firm
through his high-yield bond trading, and Drexel gradually gave him
wide independence. In 1978, the firm allowed Milken to move the
high-yield bond department to Beverly Hills, Calif.
   Drexel used junk bonds to finance hundreds of small companies in
the 1980s, reaping hundreds of millions of dollars in fees. Milken
controlled an empire of buyers and sellers of the securities issued
by the Wall Street firm.
   But junk bonds also were used by several flamboyant corporate
raiders to mount hostile takeovers that drew fire from legislators
and big business as a threat to corporate America. Milken was the
lightning rod for that criticism.
   After being linked in the press in late 1986 to Boesky's illegal
stock trading network, Milken and Drexel became the main targets of
the government innvestigators.
   They were charged with civil fraud and other allegations by the
Securities and Exchange Commission in 1988. Drexel that winter
agreed to plead guilty to six felonies and pay $650 million in
penalties.
   Milken was indicted the following March, along with his brother
and former Drexel trader Bruce Newberg. He resigned from Drexel in
June, and set up a consulting and investing firm that advises
companies but does not issue securities.
   While Milken maintained his innocence, he indicated in an
interview last fall that he just wanted the ordeal to end.
   ``If you spent your whole life trying to build things, some of
these things sap your energy and you feel frustrated,'' he said.
