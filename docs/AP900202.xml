   Curiosity didn't kill a cat trapped in
the trunk of a Mercedes-Benz for 10 days, but it nearly drove him
to catatonia.
   Kitty, the 11-year-old orange cat, apparently jumped into the
Mercedes when it was being serviced Jan. 17 at his owner's shop,
Richie's Auto Radio.
   The proprietor, Richard P. D'Auteuil, placed ads in the
newspaper, made daily calls to the Animal Rescue League and tried
to contact customers who visited his store on that day.
   ``The only customer I didn't contact was the only one I didn't
have a slip for,'' the owner of the Mercedes, D'Auteuil said.
   The Mercedes was brought back in 10 days later, and a worker
opened the trunk when he heard mewing inside, D'Auteuil said.
   Out jumped the desperate Kitty, thin and thirsty but basically
healthy.
   Kitty's strong constitution, and the relative warmth of the car,
stored in a garage, probably saved his life, said Lawrence A.
Shinnamon, a veterinarian at Anchor Animal Hospital.

   Forget regional pride. Scrap neighborly
cooperation. Wisconsin and Illinois have each accused the other of
besmirching its reputation, and the weapon of choice has been
selected: Saber-edged wit.
   The two Midwestern neighbors _ which for years have squabbled
over pollution, traffic, tourists, sports teams and bragging rights
for best chili _ are at it again, slashing at one another all over
the media dueling ground.
   Chicago claims the Badger State made the first thrust when an
advertising campaign distributed postcards that used the chalkline
of a homicide victim to portray Chicago and a chalked hopscotch
game to portray the ``tranquility'' of northeastern Wisconsin.
   The Windy City parried with one of its biggest defenders,
humorist Mike Royko, Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for the
Chicago Tribune.
   Royko called the advertising campaign by the Fox Valley Chamber
of Commerce a cheap shot that made light of his city's serious
crime problem. He wrote a column that dismissed Wisconsin residents
as ``cheeseheads ... content to chomp on bratwurst.''
   Royko wrote that the postcard was not ``sufficient provocation
for a verbal feud,'' then proceeded to paint a picture of Wisconsin
residents as deer-hunting, red flannel-wearing, cow-kissing ``farm
folk.''
   ``From its farms to its cities, you won't find kinder, simpler
folk anywhere, except in custodial care,'' he continued.
   Given all the barbs that have been traded between the two states
over the years, Royko said he was surprised by the angry reponse
from Wisconsin residents.
   ``They were frothing at the lips _ which is kind of goofy,''
Royko said in an interview this week. ``They struck the first blow.
   ``I responded to a very tasteless card,'' he said. ``There are
many people in Chicago who have been victims of crimes. Homicide is
not a laughing matter.''
   Radio stations and marketing agencies have done their best to
continue the war of words.
   ``The attitude is that Chicagoans think that Milwaukeeans are
just a bunch of hee-haw heads,'' said Mark A. Tuschel, who added
fuel to the furor with a radio spot produced by his Chicago-based
company, CW Media.
   The commercial for Little Switzerland Ski Hill, a resort near
Milwaukee, was aired on Chicago radio stations. In it, an announcer
tells some people the resort is near Milwaukee, and the group
responds with a raspberry.
   The announcer then says, ``You don't have to stay there, you
just drive through,'' eliciting a relieved cheer from the group.
   Tuschel revised the commerical after receiving complaints from
Wisconsinites, but he said the attitudes toward Milwaukee were not
of his making.
   ``If you stand on television with a cardboard wedge of cheese on
your head, you almost have it coming,'' he said, referring to the
hats frequently worn by fans at sports events in Green Bay and
Milwaukee.
   Bill Welch, president of the Fox Valley Chamber of Commerce,
conceded his office offended some people with its postcard
campaign, which was designed to attract people to Fond du Lac,
Appleton and Oshkosh.
   The homicide-hopscotch postcard compared crime rates between the
two areas and cited FBI statistics indicating Fox Valley is among
the 10 safest regions in the United States.
   Welch said he enjoyed Royko's rebuttal. ``I thought it was kind
of cute, and frankly, we appreciated it. To our mind, anything that
draws attention to the comparisons works to our benefit.''
   Mary Ladish, marketing director of the Greater Milwaukee
Committee, said Royko's column and the subsequent responses were
both part of the ``cultural divide'' enjoyed by humorists in
Wisconsin and Illinois.
   Ladish said her committee, which studies the development of the
Milwaukee metropolitan area, isn't concerned with the
``cheesehead'' jokes.
   ``Rather than just talking about image, we are working at
changing Milwaukee's image through very tangible means,'' she said,
citing efforts to market Milwaukee and its festivals, businesses
and restaurants nationwide.
   Royko said he thought his column was ``pretty funny'' and he
extended his sympathy to people ``afflicted with the lack of a
sense of humor.''
   ``They're pretty thin-skinned,'' he said. ``You read the column
and it's obvious I wrote it with my tongue partly in my cheek.''
   Wisconsinites take note _ Royko didn't say his tongue was
entirely in his cheek.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Declines Another Hearing In Topeka Desegregation
Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court has denied the
Topeka school board's request to rehear its 36-year-old
desegregation case, possibly ending more than a decade of
litigation, the plaintiffs' attorney said.
   Richard Jones, attorney for parents who reopened the Brown vs.
Topeka Board of Education case, said he received a copy of the
order from the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver on
Wednesday. The decision sided with the plaintiffs.
   ``It's good to have it come down,'' he said. ``I think I'm
finally seeing the end of the tunnel and there's not a train coming
our way.''
   Joe Zima, attorney for the school board, said the board received
the decision Thursday, but he declined immediate comment.
   The 1954 landmark case, in which the U.S. Supreme Court said the
doctrine of ``separate but equal'' had no place in public
education, was reopened in 1979. A group of parents charged that
the Topeka district had not accomplished the racial desegregation
ordered more than two decades earlier.
   In 1987, U. S. District Judge Richard Rogers of Topeka ruled
that the district had been effectively desegregated. The parents
appealed, and last year a three-member panel of the 10th Circuit
overturned Rogers' ruling, 2-1.
   The school board asked for a rehearing, and suggested that the
entire appeals court hear the case. Both the petition and
suggestion were denied by the court on Monday.
   Zima said the school board's alternatives are to accept the
denial or ask the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case.
   Jones said he doesn't expect the board to ask the U.S. Supreme
Court to hear the case, and that he thought the court would refuse
to hear it if asked.
   ``What we have had in these last 10 years is kind of a garden
variety desegregation case,'' Jones said. ``We didn't break any new
ground or come up with any new theories on the law.''
   He said that if Rogers is required to implement a desegregation
plan for the district, it must be agreeable to the plaintiffs.

<HEAD>Bush Plan Would Cause Big Changes in West Germany</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Friday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drinking beer, paying rent,
buying clothes and furnishing their apartments, U.S. soldiers
account for about $2 billion in annual revenues alone in one West
German state.
   Nationwide, the more than 250,000 GIs, their family members and
civilian U.S. military employees spend several times that amount
each year.
   For the tens of thousands of West Germans whose livelihoods
depend on the presence of the U.S. military, President Bush's troop
reduction proposal Wednesday signaled a possible major shift in
their lives.
   While the Yankees aren't going home just yet, the European
nation that grew up with U.S. troops is beginning to contemplate an
end to a large part of their sometimes controversial presence.
   The occupation troops-turned-allies are still a daily fact of
life, whether it's a fatigue-clad GI riding the S-4 subway home
from Frankfurt or the young soldier's wife in Bitburg learning
German from her landlord.
   Cars with the familiar black-and-white, American-size license
plates crowd the autobahn highways, while any simple receiver can
pick up the military's AFN radio network.
   ``Mad King Ludwig's'' Neuschwanstein Castle _ faithfully copied
in Disneyland _ is one of several meccas for soldiers and their
families every year.
   The U.S. military has also been the target of criticism and even
rage, during the anti-missile protests of the 1980s and the
low-level training flights that angered civilians.
   Farmers and villagers complain about tanks on maneuvers tearing
up fields and crunching pavement. Deadly collisions occur every
year.
   Saturday night brawls involving GIs are common, especially in
large cities such as Frankfurt.
   But in the smaller towns, whole economies have grown up around
the U.S. military bases, meaning those municipalities will have an
even harder time in the event of reduction of tens of thousands of
troops.
   ``In Rhineland Palatinate state, the U.S. military installations
have a very important economic meaning,'' says state Interior
Ministry spokesman Juergen Dietzen.
   He said 21,000 West Germans work at U.S. bases in the
southwestern state, which has nostalgic ties with the United States
because of the massive emigrations decades ago.
   In Rhineland Palatinate alone, the number of soldiers is 67,000,
while there are 79,000 family members and 9,000 U.S. civilian
workers at the bases, Dietzen said.
   ``They go beer drinking, wine drinking, they go out to dinner,
buy coats, purchase furniture, rent apartments,'' Dietzen said,
recounting the impact on the economy. ``They are store customers
and order handcrafts.''
   Dietzen estimated total expenditures by the soldiers themselves,
family members and U.S. support civilians come to more than $2
billion.
   The U.S. military itself kicks in another $400,000 to the
economy in Rhineland Palatinate, he said.
   Nevertheless, state residents are happy to see any reductions to
help the process of disarmament during improving East-West
relations, he said. In a country with the largest density of troops
and weapons in Western Europe, disarmament is a popular priority.
   Officials caution that Bush's proposal to bring down the troop
superpower strength in Central Europe to 195,000 for each side is
just that _ a plan wating to discussed and accepted by the Soviets.
Any withdrawal likely would take years.
   Cmdr. John Woodhouse, U.S. military spokesman at the European
Command in Stuttgart, cautions that the numbers have not been
itemized completely.
   Virtually all of the Central European reductions would come from
West Germany, which had nearly 255,000 U.S. troops last year,
Woodhouse says, because only small units are based in Belgium and
the Netherlands. That could lead to the withdrawal of nearly 60,000
U.S. servicemen from West Germany.
   Woodhouse says the military is starting to look at ``contingency
plans'' if the reductions occur.
   ``But we're not at the point yet where we starting to say `OK,
this unit, you're going to be starting to close down next week,'''
Woodhouse said.
   A huge reduction could drastically cut down on the 70,000 West
Germans working for the U.S. armed forces.
   One town already feeling the pinch is Zweibruecken, where the
U.S. Air Force Base with 3,500 servicemen recently was targeted for
shutdown by 1993 even before Bush's speech.
   ``The situation is alarming, since we have to find substitute
jobs for the 340 West German civilian workers,'' said Thilo Huble,
spokesman for the town located in the far southwestern part of the
country just six miles from France.
   Like Dietzen, Huble said small businesses will be hurt.
   Gitta Lampersbach, a spokesman for the federal labor ministry,
said big layoffs of West German civilian workers would be treated
like those from private industry, triggering financial and
retraining programs.
   ``In certain areas where the job structure isn't strong, that
could be a real burden on the job market,'' she said.
   Although West Germany is one of the world's richest countries,
it is struggling to cope with the influx of hundreds of thousands
of East Germans and ethnic Germans from other parts of Eastern
Europe.

<HEAD>Graves of Azerbaijani Victims Have a Hero's Place in Baku</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   On this city's highest point, the grave of
12-year-old Larisa Mamedova has a hero's place, her brown school
uniform, orange scarf and cheap blue schoolbag piled atop a
mountain of red carnations.
   Nearby, a young boy's grave _ still unmarked _ is decorated with
a pink plastic bear with blue overalls and a few chocolates. A
black-and-white photo of a round-faced, dark-haired boy of no more
than 10 is tied with a red ribbon.
   On Thursday, thousands of mourners trudged for hours past a line
of more than 100 graves dug into a terrace in a hilltop park, the
resting place for those killed when the army stormed Baku, the
capital of Azerbaijan, on Jan. 20 to put down a nationalist
uprising.
   A Moslem mullah recited prayers from a makeshift stand as the
crowd passed, some crying or wailing openly and dropping carnations
on the graves.
   The mourners are defiant, reflecting the continuing but
increasingly hidden conflict between Azerbaijanis and the Soviet
military. The burial place is formally named Kirov Park, after a
Soviet hero, but soon will be renamed in honor of those who ``died
for justice,'' said journalist Shain Hadjiev.
   In the pantheon of people's heroes, Azerbaijani policeman Yusif
Abilgasanov, 22, is buried next to Boris Yefemich, 44, and not far
from a 16-year-old Jewish girl named Vera.
   ``This is already a sacred place,'' said a 35-year-old musician
who identified himself only as Bakhtiar. ``The Azerbaijani people
won't forget this and won't forgive anyone.''
   Soviet military officials, speaking to the first foreign
journalists allowed into Baku since Jan. 20, said the army used
force to take control of the city because there was no other way.
   Armed activists of Azerbaijan's People's Front, a nationalist
group, blockaded 8,000 of more than 11,000 soldiers in the area
with buses and trucks, they said. ``We couldn't remove the
blockades any other way,'' said Soviet army spokesman Lt. Gen.
Mikhail P. Kolesnikov.
   Many of the graves are of young men who were at the barricades.
   Azerbaijani activists charge the soldiers with indiscriminate
shooting when they entered the city. Larisa Mamedova, they said,
was killed as she sat on a city bus. Elsewhere in Baku, her father
was wounded and died several days later.
   According to officials, 139 people have died in Azerbaijan since
the soldiers moved in. Many more were killed in ethnic attacks
against Armenians in Baku Jan. 13-14 and in fighting between
Armenians and Azerbaijanis throughout the Caucasus.
   Crowds come to the burial place daily, but are especially heavy
on Thursdays, a traditional time of Moslem mourning that lsts for
40 days after death. The mourners wept especially hard when they
passed the graves of the children.
   Hadjiev and other activists said Soviet tanks entered the city
from the airport, shooting at everything in their way. Other tanks
crushed a half-dozen cars in a parking lot as they burst from
behind a wall of the military arsenal.
   The soldiers were a week too late to save Armenians who died in
the ethnic attacks, say People's Front activists. They blame
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for the bloodshed.
   Nadzhov Nadzhavov, editor of the banned People's Front
newspaper, said Gorbachev gave in to reformist critics by not
cracking down on separatists in the Baltic republic of Lithuania,
but appeased conservative critics by allowing the military to take
Baku. ``Gorbachev's hands are now bloody,'' he said.
   The Soviet leader, looking tired and defeated in a TV address on
Jan. 20, told the nation the soldiers were sent to Baku to stop
attacks on Armenians and to control well-armed fighters.
   ``All our attempts at dialogue (with extremists) ended like
this: You don't touch us, we won't touch you,'' said Kolesnikov, a
Baku resident.
   ``All of the windows of my apartment house were broken out. Is
this dialogue?'' he asked.
   Red carnations are stuck in bushes next to the park, located
near the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet and down the street from
the Soviet military's southern command and the KGB offices.
   More carnations are strewn at crossroads where Azerbaijanis
died. Soldiers stand guard there at night with armored personnel
carriers and military trucks to enforce an 11 p.m.-5 a.m. curfew.
   The park also closes for curfew but lights flood the area all
night, Hadjiev said. Soldiers and police don't come near.
   Bakhtiar, the musician, said as he left the park after his daily
visit that Azerbaijan has a bright future, but without Moscow.
   Asked if he favored full independence for Azerbaijan, he said,
``Naturally.''

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The coded telegram from Bolshevik revolutionaries
reporting the execution of Russian Czar Nicholas II and his family
in 1918 has been found in a bank vault among papers left by the
original investigator of the crime.
   The papers, hidden in the vault for nearly 70 years, will be
auctioned in London on April 5, Sotheby's said Thursday. The
auction house would not disclose the owner's identity or say where
the papers were concealed.
   ``The owner knew that her uncle called them his `dynamite
papers' but until bringing them to us, she had no idea of what they
were,'' said John Stuart, Sotheby's consultant on Russian art and
history.
   An auction estimate of $500,000 to $840,000 has been put on the
papers but Stuart remarked: ``What price can you put on them? There
is interest in them everywhere. It isn't clear whether the Soviet
government will buy them.''
   Stuart said the owner is a descendant of Prince Nikolai Orlov
who went into exile in France after the revolution. He said Orlov
inherited the papers in 1924 on the death of his fellow-exile
Nikolai Sokolov, the investigator.
   Sokolov was a lawyer working for the anti-Bolshevik White
Russian forces. After the killing of the czar's family in the Ural
mountain town of Ekaterinburg, the White Russians overran the area
and Sokolov went to work.
   He interrogated everyone he could find about the fate of the
last members of the Romanov dynasty and gathered every scrap of
paper relating to their last days.
   The Bolsheviks withdrew so quickly that they failed to take the
originals of their telegrams at the local telegraph office. Among
them was the crucial one of July 17, 1918, the day after the royal
family disappeared.
   Its coded numbers translate as: ``Tell Sverdlov the entire
family suffered the same fate as its head. Officially the family
will perish in evacuation.''
   The message signed by Alexander Beloborodov, chairman of the
Ural Soviet, and addressed to Nikolai Gorbunov, an official, was
for Yankel Sverdlov, Lenin's head of state and leader of the Cheka
secret police.
   ``The telegram and the other papers establish beyond doubt in my
view that the murder of the whole family was directed from Moscow,
but the leaders did not want to admit that at the time and claimed
it was done without their orders,'' said Stuart.
   ``The Bolsheviks were determined to wipe out every Romanov they
could find and I am convinced that the theories that any of them
escaped from Ekaterinburg are fantasy,'' he said.
   Sokolov's book about the executions was published in Paris in
1924. It contained reproductions of some of the evidence he
collected, including the telegram.
   The discovered files include a steamship bill for the conveyance
of the royal family for part of the journey to Ekaterinburg,
accounts of tips to porters and their guards' signatures on pay
receipts.
   There are also photographs of the house of the merchant Nikolai
Ipatiev, which the Bolsheviks took over. In the cellar there they
executed Czar Nicholas, his wife, Alexandra, their five children
and four servants.
   A handwritten note to a chemist's shop in Ekaterinburg demands
delivery of 400 pounds of sulfuric acid costing 196 rubles, 50
kopeks, equivalent to about $95 before the revolution.
   Sokolov believed the acid and a large quantity of gasoline were
used to destroy the bodies.
   ``All the people involved in killing the royal family were
themselves killed in fighting, murders or purges,'' Stuart said.
``Sverdlov was assassinated in 1919 and Ekaterinburg was renamed
Sverdlovsk in his memory.''

<TEXT>
   A tree-planting ceremony for Arbor Day is at
the root of the latest squabble between the left and right branches
of Israeli politics.
   Israeli lawmakers usually mark the day, which this year falls on
Feb. 7, by planting trees in a forest near Parliament.
   But since that forest is fully planted, Parliament Speaker Dov
Shilansky of the right-wing Likud bloc chose a site near the Jewish
settlement of Maale Adumim in the occupied West Bank.
   Leftist lawmakers announced a boycott of the ceremony, since it
would be on land occupied in the 1967 Middle East War. They want to
trade at least some of that territory for peace with the Arabs.
   Shilansky has suggested a compromise site on Mount Scopus in
east Jerusalem, the Arab section of the city annexed by Israel
after the 1967 war.
   But the leftists left everybody hanging. They say they may hold
a separate ceremony in pre-1967 Israel.

<TEXT>
   Dr. Gernot Winkler is a government bureaucrat
with plenty of time on his hands.
   Winkler's offices at the U.S. Naval Observatory are crowded with
sundials, hourglasses, bejeweled antique watches, pendulum clocks,
quartz clocks and atomic clocks so incredibly accurate that Winkler
has no excuse for being late to work.
   ``Our business is time,'' says Winkler, 67, an Austrian-born
astronomer and theoretical physicist who has been America's
official timekeeper for the past 24 years. A well-worn scythe, the
familiar emblem of Father Time, is propped up near his desk.
   Winkler's master timepiece is the atomic clock, which actually
consists of 24 box-like metal instruments housed in eight
climate-controlled vaults scattered around the observatory's
tree-shaded grounds on a northwest Washington hillside.
   Each of the faceless clocks contains cesium atoms which, when
heated to a low boil, emit faint beams of light from
electromagnetic radiation at an unchanging frequency of
9,192,631,770 cycles per second.
   Every hour, computers automatically compare readings from all
the clocks to produce a uniform time that doesn't vary more than a
nanosecond _ one-billionth of a second _ from day to day. Some of
the atomic clocks are accurate to one-tenth of a nanosecond.
   To set all his clocks, Winkler relies on a network of radio
astronomers from Hawaii to Bologna, Italy. They determine the exact
position of Earth as it rotates on its axis by taking a
simultaneous fix on some distant star sending signals from the
depths in space, millions of light-years away.
   The precision of the atomic clock seems unbelievable in a world
weary of wristwatches that suddenly stop and alarm clocks that
don't ring.
   It is so accurate, says Winkler, that it's not the clock but the
rest of the world that goes wrong.
   Every year or two, Winkler adds a ``leap second'' to the atomic
clock's time to compensate for a very slow decrease in the Earth's
rotation, which is thrown slightly out of kilter by winds, ocean
currents, earthquakes and even melting snow.
   Today's master clock is 10 million times more accurate than the
quaint old pendulum clocks that tick-tocked the official time until
as recently as 1950, when the observatory switched to quartz clocks
and then _ eight years later _ to cesium atomic beam clocks.
   Nonetheless, time doesn't weigh heavy for Winkler the way it
does for the Maytag repairman.
   No matter how flawlessly his atomic clocks run, he says, he must
keep trying to shave off another millisecond here or there to meet
the increasingly sophisticated demands of electronic navigation and
communications systems, from deep-running nuclear submarines to
satellites beaming weather advisories to airports.
   ``We don't wait for something to happen,'' he said. ``We need to
be in the forefront of technological capabilities. If we didn't,
we'd be as obsolete as the pendulum clock in three to five years.''
   Already, he says a possible successor to the atomic clock is a
new device that employs ions or electrically charged atoms of
mercury that are trapped in an electromagnetic ``bottle'' and
produce a fluorescent glow with a much higher frequency than cesium
beams.
   When he's not busy perfecting his clocks and keeping an eye on
the observatory's time-of-day announcements by telephone (dial
1-900-410-TIME), Winkler says he answers an occasional piece of
``nut mail'' about the time.
   Like the guy who asked, ``What actually happens to the time you
waste?'' Or the request for an exact definition of a moment.
   A woman's letter _ one of Winkler's favorites _ inquired what
God did with his time before he created the world.
   ``I wrote back that he invented hell for people who ask stupid
questions,'' he said.

<HEAD>Report Says AIDS Infections Declining, Heterosexuals Have Little
Risk</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A new report says the number of Americans
becoming infected annually with the virus that causes AIDS is
declining, although the number of new AIDS cases will continue
rising until 1995.
   The report's author, Peter Plumley, a consulting actuary in
Chicago, also says the chances that a heterosexual not using drugs
intravenously will become infected are remote and that AIDS
prevention efforts focus too much on this group.
   Plumley writes in the January-February issue of Contingencies
magazine that the number of new annual infections with the human
immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, peaked in 1986 and is going down.
   However, he says the total number of HIV-infected Americans will
continue to rise until 1991, when 1.4 million will be infected.
   Also, the number of new AIDS cases will continue to rise until
1995 and then begin to decline, and the number of AIDS deaths will
peak at around 110,000 in 1997, Plumley's projections show.
   Years can elapse between the time of infection with HIV and the
onset of AIDS. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS.
   He predicted that by the year 2000 there will have been a total
of 1.3 million AIDS cases and about 1.1 million AIDS deaths.
   His figures do not include HIV infections and AIDS cases among
blood transfusion recipients, hemophiliacs and children, which
account for about 5 percent of the total infections.
   As of Dec. 31, 1989, AIDS had been diagnosed in 117,781
Americans. Sixty percent, or 70,313, had died since June 1, 1981,
according to the federal Centers for Disease Control.
   The CDC, which estimates that about 1 million people in the
United States are HIV-infected now, is revising its projections for
future spread of the disease.
   A draft report released earlier this month predicted that
projections for the numbers of cases will be about 15 percent lower
than previous CDC estimates.
   CDC spokeswoman Gayle Lloyd said until the agency issues new
projections, ``no one here is interested in talking about anyone
else's projections.''
   Plumley said, ``One of the most disturbing aspects of the AIDS
epidemic is the number of people who have become concerned
unnecessarily about the epidemic.''
   The virus is spread mainly through contact with bodily fluids,
including sexual intercourse, particularly anal sex, and sharing of
needles. Its chief victims have been homosexual males and
intravenous drug users.
   A homosexual male's risk of contracting AIDS is about 1 in 500,
according to Plumley. But the risk for a heterosexual engaging in
vaginal sex is less than one in a million, providing their sex
partners are not from a high-risk group.
   Prevention efforts within the homosexual, bisexual and
intravenous drug user communities should continue, but ``valid
reasons exist to attempt to temper warnings issued to people whose
risks are as remote as one in a million or less.
   ``Hyperbole could divert the focus from the truly serious areas
of risk, damage credibility of the prevention efforts and create
paranoia among those who don't understand and jeopardize their
chances of forming the kinds of relationships necessary to health
and well-being,'' he wrote.

<HEAD>Rep. Savage Made `Improper Advances,' Ethics Committee Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Gus Savage made ``improper advances'' to
a Peace Corps volunteer during a trip to Zaire last March,
violating a House rule on members' conduct, according to a House
ethics committee report.
   However, the committee took no action to punish the Chicago
Democrat, citing a voluntary letter of apology he wrote to the
woman, according to the unreleased report obtained Thursday by The
Associated Press.
   ``Had the congressman not taken the initiative to send such a
letter, the committee would have directed that he do so,'' the
report said. The report also noted the panel has not previously
considered a member's conduct during an official visit to a foreign
country.
   The panel, formally the Committee on Standards of Official
Conduct, concluded ``that Rep. Savage's sexual advances ... were
contrary'' to a rule requiring members' conduct to ``reflect
creditably'' on the House.
   Savage, who is black, contended in a House speech to a nearly
empty chamber Thursday that the committee was declining to pursue
the case _ adding he received ``not even a slap on the wrist.'' He
did not mention the letter of apology.
   According to an interview the unnamed woman gave the committee
last September, Savage took the volunteer on a tour of night spots
in Kinshasa, Zaire, placed his hand on her leg and thigh and tried
to persuade her to have sex with him.
   ``She recalled that he stated, as he was pulling her over to
him, that one should be prepared to give their all to the movement
and, if one is not prepared to do so, they are not really members
of the Black movement but are, rather, traitors to it,'' the report
said.
   Savage described the allegations as a ``racist attack'' by white
government officials and the white-owned news media and called the
three House Democrats who filed a complaint against him
``self-appointed guardians of personal morality.''
   The three, Reps. Patricia Schroeder of Colorado, Matthew McHugh
of New York and Barney Frank of Massachusetts, had no comment.
   While the ethics panel did not recommend any punishment and will
not pursue the case to the trial stage, the report said, ``The
committee concluded Rep. Savage subjected a Peace Corps volunteer
to improper advances'' during his visit to Kinshasa, Zaire, last
March 19.
   The report added Savage ``has acknowledged that he may have
acted inappropriately as evidenced by his letter'' to the woman. In
an interview with the committee before the letter was written,
however, the report said Savage denied her allegations.
   The committee said it was placing other House members ``on
notice'' that similar conduct would be viewed ``with the clear
possibility that additional action might be pursued.''
   Savage's letter to the woman said in part, ``While in Zaire
earlier this year, if you felt personally offended by any words or
actions of mine, I apologize, because I never intended to offend
and was not aware that you felt offended at that time.''
   The woman was included in a party of U.S. officials that met
with Savage because she was from his district, the report said.
   According to the report, the volunteer said Savage took her on a
tour of night spots in a chauffeur-driven car with no other
passengers.
   ``The ... volunteer stated that soon after the car began to
move, Rep. Savage grabbed her around the shoulders and tried to
pull her up against him,'' the committee report said.
   The volunteer pushed him away, the report said, and she
``indicated that the congressman pulled her up against him, grabbed
her face, and forced her to kiss him. She stated that she was very
frightened, was pushing Rep. Savage away, but that he was not
listening and did not stop.''
   After visiting a night spot, according to the report, Savage
directed her to one of the cars and ``as soon as they were seated
... the congressman renewed his earlier behavior ...''
   ``This time, however, he asked her to have sex with him and
tried to persuade her to do so.''
   The woman told the committee she resisted and began talking
about her work in a shelter and in the black community. Savage,
according to the account, said, ``You should know that there are
rewards to people who give their all to the movement, give
everything to the movement.''
   While in a second night club, the woman told the committee,
Savage ``placed his hand on her leg and thigh, and told her she was
beautiful and he wished her to have sex with him. She was very
upset and not responsive.''
   She said the night ended at a hotel, where Savage made what the
woman described as a ``last-ditch pitch'' and asked her to
accompany him on the rest of his trip.
   ``She rejected his suggestion, saying that she wished to spend
no more time with him and that she did not want ever to see or hear
from him again,'' the report said.

<HEAD>Democrats Say Bush Fails to Back up Education Proposals With Money</HEAD>

   President Bush's claims to be charting a
program of ``excellence in education'' are under swift and heavy
attack as being unrealistic with only a 2 percent education budget
increase to back them up.
   Bush was heading to universities in North Carolina and Tennessee
today to promote the national education goals he announced in his
State of the Union address Wednesday night.
   At North Carolina State University the president was visiting a
semiconductor lab and holding a roundtable discussion on
competitiveness.
   Later his itinerary was taking him to the University of
Tennessee.
   The president came under attack from Democrats and education
groups almost as soon as he announced the goals for improvement in
students' math and science achievement, literacy and drug-free
schools.
   ``There is a yawning gap between the rhetoric of President
Bush's education speeches and the funding levels he offers in his
budget,'' said Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation
of Teachers.
   ``The president's words about making American workers the most
productive in the world by the year 2000 are right on the mark,''
said Stephen Blair, president of the National Association of Trade
and Technical Schools.
   However, he said, ``The hard reality is, his ... 1991 budget
will deprive thousands of young Americans of their chance for
quality postsecondary education, particularly in urgently needed
technical fields.'' He said the budget plan would dramatically
reduce program funding for postsecondary education.
   The critics also demand to know where the money would come from
to slash the dropout rate and make U.S. children tops in math and
science by the year 2000, as Bush seeks.
   In his 1991 budget proposal on Monday, Bush sought $500 million
_ 2 percent _ more for the Education Department. He also requested
an extra $500 million for Head Start, which is in the Department of
Health and Human Services budget.
   Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos, on Thursday defended
Bush's plan saying, ``It's not a matter of dollars.''
   ``We could keep on adding ... another billion and another
billion. That is not going to solve the education deficit,''
Cavazos told reporters.
   The way math and science is taught must be radically changed, he
said. Just putting more dollars into the current system ``is not
going to make good mathematicians'' of students, said Cavazos.
   However, he also said the Education Department's proposed $24.6
billion budget for fiscal 1991 ``is the largest education budget
that this nation has had,'' with ``a very healthy 6.2 percent
increase in discretionary programs.''
   But Richard Miller, executive director of the American
Association of School Administrators, urged Bush ``to get beyond
rhetoric. ... His budget proposal for education is at odds with the
goals.''
   Cavazos said American students are in last place in performance
on math and science, compared with children in other industrialized
nations.
   Bush's education goals follow on the education summit he held
with the 50 governors in Charlottesville, Va., where they agreed to
come up with such performance goals.
   The National Governors' Association is to vote on the end
product at its winter meeting at the end of this month.
   Meanwhile, the Bush administration opened a lobbying campaign
for its proposals to cut the capital gains tax and boost personal
savings, with Chief of Staff John Sununu accusing Democrats of
being ``the party of taxes.''
   Sununu rebuked Democrats for failing to join Republicans in
giving Bush a standing ovation during the State of the Union
address Wednesday, when Bush said the federal budget could be
balanced ``with no new taxes.''
   Democrats bristled at Sununu's attack, and House Speaker Thomas
Foley, D-Wash., told reporters his party agrees something needs to
be done about America's plummeting savings rate, but rejects Bush's
tax cut.

   All 1,000 gold coins taken by a Tokyo dealer to a
bank for deposit turned out to be counterfeits of coins issued in
1985 to commemorate the 60th year of Emperor Hirohito's reign,
police said.
   The fakes were copies of commemorative 100,000-yen coins, the
equivalent of about $694 each, authorities said Thursday.
   A police official declined to identify the dealer or provide
further details.
   However, Japanese newspapers said each coin weighed about 0.7
ounces, and each had a tiny flaw in the same place on the surface.
   Fuji Bank official Seiji Takeuchi said Wednesday the bank found
that some coins, while almost identical to the real currency, were
slightly lighter in color.

   Super-rich investor Sid Bass found a
creative way to deal with an unwanted mansion next door: buy it,
cut it up into pieces and rebuild it somewhere else.
   Bass and his wife Mercedes plan to move their former neighbors'
6,600-square-foot house to the grounds of the Lena Pope Home, a
facility for abused, neglected and emotionally disturbed children.
   Officials say the donated four-bedroom, French-style house will
be used as a residence for eight girls and a married couple called
family teachers.
   The house was the former residence of the Mac Churchill family,
who moved after selling the property to the Basses about three
months ago.
   ``Thank goodness the Basses are doing this,'' Churchill said.
``Nobody else could have thought of doing it.''
   Bass, whose fortune is estimated in the hundreds of millions of
dollars, is in the process of remodeling his own red-brick colonial
house.

   Janet Jackson, the baby of the musical Jackson

not.
   ``Michael and I are the closest in the family, between all my
brothers and sister,'' Janet tells Rolling Stone magazine in its
upcoming issue. ``He said that out of everyone in the family, we're
the two that think the most alike.''
   Janet, whose ``Rhythm Nation 1814'' has sold almost 3 million
copies, said she wants to sell as many records as her
multi-platinum brother.
   ``When `Thriller' came out, I was so envious. I was so happy for
him, but it was like, `Why can't that be me?' That's what inspired
me,'' she said.
   She found no inspiration, only puzzlement, in sister LaToya's
semi-nude appearance in Playboy magazine.
   ``It didn't seem like the LaToya that I knew, the LaToya that I
know,'' she said. ``She said it was something she needed to do ...

   ``Miami Vice'' actor Don Johnson may turn to a bank
next time he needs a loan. And a friend of his may be sure his next
deal is done in writing.
   Last year, Johnson's company DJ Racing secured an interest-free
$300,000 loan from Johnson's friend, lawyer and real estate
investor Martin Ergas. Ergas has sued for failure to repay the loan
by November, but Johnson says the money to build a racing boat
isn't due to be paid back until 1995.
   Donald M. Klein, attorney for Johnson and his company, said the
lawsuit is ``an effort to embarrass Mr. Johnson into settling. He
does not do that as a general principle, and in this case he
definitely doesn't do it.''
   Neil Berman, Ergas' lawyer, said his client was glad to lend a
good friend $300,000 until November on a handshake, but would have
been more businesslike if he knew he'd have to wait five years for
his money back.
   ``It was a shock,'' Berman said. ``Their whole deal was
predicated on trust among friends.'' The lawsuit wa filed Tuesday
in Dade Circuit Court.

   C. Everett Koop's actions to warn of
the dangers of smoking and press for preventing the spread of AIDS
through education earned him this year's Harry S. Truman Award for
Public Service.
   The award is presented annually by the city _ hometown of the
former president _ to an American possessing the qualities
personified by Truman.
   Independence Mayor Barbara Potts announced on Thursday the
choice of Koop, the former U.S. surgeon general. She said his
outspoken style and exemplary service to Americans distinguished
him.
   Koop is now chairman of the National SAFE KIDS Campaign, a board
member of AIDS Care Education and Training, and chairman of the
National Museum of Health and Medicine Foundation.
   The award will be presented May 6 at the Truman Library and

   Jane Fonda, a longtime favorite target of
conservative politicians, can count a Republican, Barbara Bush,
among her admirers.
   Mrs. Bush praised the actress for her portrayal of a woman who
teaches an adult illiterate in Fonda's new movie, ``Stanley &amp;
Iris.''
   She felt it gives a good ``depiction of the Laubach method'' of
teaching reading, says Mrs. Bush's press secretary, Anna Perez.
   Literacy is Mrs. Bush's favorite cause. She frequently speaks on
the topic and promotes pro-literacy groups.
   Perez said the first lady had the movie sent to the White House
several weeks ago for a private viewing with some of her staff.
   In the movie, Fonda teaches a brilliant inventor, played by
Robert De Niro, to read.
   The MGM-UA film opens around the country this month.

   Malik, known to American audiences for his role as Hari Kumar in
the British TV series, ``The Jewel in the Crown,'' was leaving a
restaurant with his English-born wife, Gina, and an actress friend
March 4 when Grant Maloney shouted insulting remarks at the two
women, the prosecutor said.
   He said Malik, 37, called out that one of the women was his
wife, and Maloney replied with an offensive remark about women who

   Maloney, 24, punched Malik in the face and kicked him while
shouting that he hated Pakistanis, the court was told.
   Maloney was sentenced Thursday.

<HEAD>Crop Insurance Would be Eliminated Under Bush Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As Congress probes deeper into new farm
legislation, the Federal Crop Insurance Corp. and its mission to
help protect farmers against losses from drought and other natural
disasters is drawing a lot of criticism.
   The Bush administration wants to eliminate the half-century-old
FCIC coverage in favor of some kind of permanent disaster program.
Farmer acceptance of the insurance program is lukewarm and costly.
   Moreover, every time there is a serious drought, flood or other
threat to crops, Congress comes up with a relief measure, and many
say that makes FCIC operations unnecessary.
   One of the recommendations in the budget proposals President
Bush sent to Congress this week was the elimination of federal crop
insurance, starting with the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.
   The Bush proposal would include enough money in the 1991 fiscal
year to finish off 1990 insurance operations, some $430 million
against outlays of $1.18 billion in 1990, but would put an end to
new coverage.
   According to an Agriculture Department budget analysis, the FCIC
``has not been able to provide adequate risk protection for farmers
at a reasonable cost to taxpayers.''
   The department added: ``Further, ad hoc disaster legislation was
enacted in both 1988 and 1989. The administration will work closely
with Congress to fashion a permanent disaster assistance program
which can provide an effective safety net for farmers and
ranchers.''
   In the document submitted by Bush, the Office of Management and
Budget included figures showing how the FCIC has operated. The
agency was created on Feb. 16, 1938, to provide ``a sound system of
crop insurance'' for farmers, the document said.
   But for the crop years 1948 through 1988, the budget document
said, the FCIC paid out indemnities totaling nearly $4.89 billion
while collecting premiums of $3.13 billion, making a ``loss ratio''
of 1.56.
   In other words, farmers collected $1.56 in benefits for each $1
in premium payments during those 40 years.
   The actuarial figures are based on crop years instead of fiscal
years, so the expenditures and benefits don't match exactly. Crop
years vary, with wheat, barley and oats beginning on June 1; corn,
sorghum and soybeans, Oct. 1; and cotton, peanuts and rice, Aug. 1.
   As an example of FCIC operations under current law, the White
House report showed that for 1991 crop years farmers would pay
premiums of about $507.9 million. The premium subsidies would add
$169.3 million, making a total premium of $677.3 million.
   The projections show indemnities paid out for losses could be
more than $1 billion in the 1991 crop years, making a loss ratio of
1.5, the same as the level expected in 1990 but below the 1.7 of
1989.
   Because the federal subsidy is part of the total premium, the
loss ratio actually understates the real cost to taxpayers,
according to USDA analysts.
   Although the White House document and the USDA backup analysis
make it clear the FCIC should be scrapped entirely, there has been
some opposition voiced already on Capitol Hill.
   Sen. Quentin Burdick, D-N.D., whose state has been hit severely
by drought the last couple of years, said the insurance proposal
``is a case of the president throwing out the baby with the bath
water.''
   Burdick added, ``The present crop insurance program isn't
perfect, but we need to provide some sort of federal assistance for
farmers struck by weather-related disasters.''
   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., said Bush's proposal failed to include
money for a permanent emergency aid program to replace crop
insurance.
   ``Farmers will not engage in this trapeze act with the
administration because they recognize that the safety net is made
of promises,'' he said. ``They will not be deceived by the sleight
of hand.''
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said the Bush proposal
leaves more room for negotiation with Congress than some of the
critics have indicated.
   ``In other words, what we say in this budget is that we need to
deal with this issue in whatever way seems most appropriate after
we have a full debate on the subject,'' he said. ``You've all heard
me say that we need to go to one program or the other. We cannot
afford to go to two.''
   The conclusion within the administration is that ``the crop
insurance program as it presently exists is simply not
defensible,'' Yeutter said.
   ``We are not suggesting that there be neither program in
existence,'' he said. ``We are prepared to work with the Congress
in finding the proper solution and fashioning it, and then trying
to find the money to fund it somewhere, somehow.''
   Yeutter is expected to be questioned closely next week when he
appears before the Senate Agriculture Committee to present the
administration's view on 1990 farm legislation.
   Although Yeutter has said the administration will not have a
formal bill as such, he may opt to present outlines of some of the
portions that will be covered. If there is a plan for crop
insurance or an alternative disaster program, the session with
Senate lawmakers on Feb. 7 might be a good place to unveil it.

   A policeman who worked in the burglary
division held up a bank himself, but was captured when two
bystanders chased him down, authorities said.
   The 27-year-old officer was supposed to be on duty at the time,
police said.
   They said the officer, whom they did not identify by name,
robbed the Post Office Bank in suburban Sipoo Wednesday with an
accomplice, who was not a policeman.
   The officer tried to flee alone in an unmarked police car, but
two bystanders hopped into their own car and chased him. They
caught up with him several miles away and blocked his vehicle, the
authorities said.
   The policeman fired three shots at his pursuers with his
revolver, but no one was hurt. He did not resist arrest after he
was cornered. The accomplice, who was left behind at the bank, was
arrested there soon after the robbery, authorities said.
   Police declined to say how much money was stolen but said it was
all recovered.

<HEAD>Budget Crunch Will Jam Voice of America Broadcasts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   What Soviet jamming failed to do, U.S. budget
cuts are managing. As of April 1, the Voice of America is
eliminating six of its 43 language services.
   The move, which will affect devotees of American radio from
Uzbekistan to Malawi, will cost 57 people their jobs.
   Eliminating the Turkish, Greek, Lao, Uzbek, Slovenian and
Swahili broadcasts is expected to save the government's radio
network $2.9 million.
   ``This is the toughest and saddest day of my professional
life,'' VOA Director Richard W. Carlson told hundreds of
broadcasters, editors and engineers Thursday.
   After announcing the cuts, Carlson read the names of each of the
employees who will lose their jobs. Many of them have worked for
VOA for over 20 years.
   Vilified for years as a tool of U.S. propaganda, jammed by
Soviet frequencies throughout the world, the Voice of America has
been reaching the far corners of the world with news and
entertainment programs for 42 years.
   But for the past four years, VOA has been grappling with an
eroding budget. Inflation and real cuts have forced the station to
fire more than 200 people, shut down five bureaus in the United
States and abroad, and eliminate hundreds of radio hours.
   This time, VOA and its parent, the U.S. Information Agency,
decided on ``amputation'' of whole language services rather than
``dismemberment'' by across the board cuts. This way, Carlson said,
VOA will have 37 healthy services and not 43 ``crippled'' ones.
   Debate about VOA's budget needs is scheduled in Congress later
this month, as critics are questioning whether the new order in
Eastern Europe have made VOA redundant.
   But Carlson said VOA also broadcasts to China, Cambodia, Africa,
and other areas of strife. VOA also argues its mission in Europe is
more important than ever in helping the formerly one-party nations
learn about democracy.
   ``The people in this room helped shape the revolution in
Europe,'' Carlson told the employees. ``This will cripple our
efforts at a time of unprecedented change and opportunity.''
   The selection of the services to be eliminated was made
according to priorities that take into account the political
importance of the targeted countries and the availability of other
foreign media there.
   Elimination of the Slovenian service comes during unprecedented
ferment in the Yugoslav republic by residents eager to reform the
communist system. But most Slovenians speak Serbo-Croatian and VOA
still has a service in that language, Carlson said. Slovenians also
have access to the British Broadcasting Corporation's World Service.
   Uzbeks in the Soviet Union and in Afghanistan and China can
listen to the BBC's Uzbek service. The BBC also has Turkish and
Greek programs.
   Impoverished communist Laos is the only country that will no
longer hear foreign broadcasts once the VOA's Lao service is
eliminated.
   VOA's operating budget for 1990 is about $170 million, and the
budget for next year is expected to be $174 million. Carlson said
this includes a 3.5 percent wage increase and still leaves VOA $1.5
million short.
   The problems were compounded this week when the administration's
1991 budget proposal called for the addition of a Tibetan language
service. VOA officials estimate it will cost $1.5 million to air
two hours a week of Tibetan programs.
   ``If we don't get budget relief, I'm afraid we're looking at
more cuts,'' Carlson said in an interview.

   Psst, comrade! Spare a few rubles for a
bankrupt American health clinic?
   Health officials in Summer County are issuing a worldwide SOS,
asking Soviet, Japanese, British and French officials through a
letter campaign to help eliminate a $13,712 deficit.
   ``We don't find it unpalatable to ask for aid. We're
desperate,'' said Steve Trail, sanitarian for the Summers County
Health Department, which is also seeking help from the Geneva-based
World Health Organization.
   Trail said Wednesday that state budget cuts have left the rural
three-person department unable to function properly.
   The health department, one of 21 in West Virginia bankrupted by
declining tax revenues, was joined the others in appealing to state
officials for money to stay open.
   ``If we have sinned, tell us we'll rectify it. If not, send us
money,'' Trail said. He said the department also will appeal to 15
corporate foundations,
   The health department last week stopped offering free pap
smears, breast exams and blood pressure checks, despite the
county's high cancer, diabetes and heart disease rates, he said.
   State Bureau of Public Health spokeswoman Nancy Tolliver said
the state isn't turning a deaf ear.
   ``The state is willing to work with them. We will not let their
doors be closed,'' she said.

   Gov. George Mickelson, recognizing the
historical hurt suffered by Indians, smoked a peace pipe with
tribal leaders and proclaimed a year of reconciliation in 1990, a
century after the Wounded Knee massacre.
   The governor and representatives of eight Sioux tribes drew
deeply and passed the pipe Thursday as they sat in a circle around
a buffalo skull and other items in the center of the state Capitol
rotunda.
   The members of the South Dakota Legislature and hundreds of
other spectators applauded as Mickelson and the tribal leaders
completed the ceremony. They then signed a proclamation designating
1990 as a time for healing wounds that have festered between
Indians and non-Indians for a century.
   During the state's centennial celebration last year, Indians
refused to take part, claiming they had nothing to celebrate. They
have been at odds with state government over issues such as hunting
and fishing rights, law enforcement on reservation highways and
contracts for state services.
   The governor decided it was time to bury the tomahawk.
   Mickelson said he gathered the state lawmakers and the Indian
leaders together to ``make this truly a year of reconciliation that
marks a new beginning.''
   ``I believe it places a responsibility on all of us throughout
this year to make a personal commitment,'' the governor said.
   Indians are going through especially tough times in the state.
On South Dakota's nine reservations, unemployment approaches 80
percent, and alcoholism, drugs and health care are severe problems.
   Four reservation counties rank among the nation's very poorest
in terms of per capita income.
   Tim Giago, publisher of the weekly Lakota Times, had challenged
Mickelson to proclaim 1990 as a year to help ease racial discord
between Indian and white people in South Dakota. Mickelson thanked
the Indian publisher for issuing the challenge.
   In the proclamation, Mickelson said that as South Dakota begins
its second century of statehood, people must also remember that the
creation of the state was a sad time for Indians.
   In December 1890, a little more than a year after South Dakota
became a state, Sioux leader Sitting Bull was killed and nearly 300
Sioux men, women and children were killed by U.S. government troops
in the Wounded Knee massacre.
   ``Strife between the cultures in South Dakota has, for 100
years, been of grave concern and continues to be of grave
concern,'' the governor said in the proclamation.
   The 100th anniversary of the tragic events offers an opportunity
for Indians and non-Indians to put aside their fears and mistrust,
build friendships, cooperate, learn about each other's culture and
develop a respect and understanding that will grow in the next
century, Mickelson said.
   More than 6 percent of the state's population _ or about 45,000
people _ are Indians, according to the 1980 U.S. Census.
   Mickelson said he realizes state government and the tribal
governments won't settle all their disputes in the next year, but
many of the problems might be resolved.
   A council of Indians and non-Indians should put together a broad
plan by March 1 for celebrating the year of reconciliation, the
governor said, and each South Dakotan should think about ways to
bridge the cultural gap between Indians and non-Indians in the long
run.
   The proclamation was signed by the governor and representatives
of the Flandreau-Santee Sioux, Oglala Sioux, Rosebud Sioux, Yankton
Sioux, Standing Rock Sioux, Cheyenne River, the Lower Brule Tribe
and the Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe. A Crow Creek Sioux
representative didn't show up for the ceremony, but officials said
a tribal representative may sign it later.
   The ceremony opened when two Sioux men sang the ``Lakota Flag
Song'' in a high-pitched, haunting, wavering harmony, and Sioux
military veterans carried in the U.S. flag, a Sioux eagle staff
adorned with feathers, and other flags.
   It ended with the Sioux men singing the ``Peace Song.''

<HEAD>Bill to Slash Civil Damages Under Racketeering Bill Clears Panel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maximum civil fraud damages awarded under the
nation's major anti-racketeering law would be cut under a bill
approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee and now ready for floor
action.
   The bill won 11-2 approval on Thursday with sponsors complaining
that attorneys have used the law _ designed as a tool against
organized crime _ in ordinary fraud cases, thus thwarting the will
of Congress.
   ``It didn't intend for federal judges to be using treble damages
in divorce decree cases and landlord-tenant cases,'' said Sen.
Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., the chief sponsor.
   The committee acted despite complaints from consumer groups that
the bill would weaken a tool needed to deter unscrupulous
businessmen from robbing the public through white-collar fraud
schemes.
   Fraud victims currently can sue for triple damages under the
1970 Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).
   Investors who lost thousands of dollars by purchasing bonds
through the now-defunct Lincoln Savings and Loan of Irvine, Calif.,
have filed a RICO suit against an array of civil defendants,
including the accountants who gave the institution a clean bill of
financial health.
   DeConcini's bill would enable consumers to seek punitive damages
up to twice actual damages plus attorneys' fees. Attempting to
collect, however, would mean facing a second court action following
a trial.
   The bill would require those seeking such damages to show
``clear and convincing evidence'' of fraud rather than the
``preponderance of the evidence'' often used in civil cases. They
also would have to prove that ``the defendant's actions were
consciously malicious or so egregious and deliberate that malice
may be implied.''
   Consumers would be limited to actual damages without attorneys'
fees in cases involving securities or commodity futures. The limit
would not, however, apply to insider trading violations.
   Proponents say a landslide of RICO suits in recent years is
enriching attorneys and thwarting the will of Congress.
   ``Broad language that may be appropriate against the Mafia can
be abused when used in a garden-variety fraud case,'' Chairman
Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., told the Judiciary Committee.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, told the panel the ``bill is
wanting'' and that he would oppose the measure on the floor.
   The original bill would have been retroactive and thus would
have wiped out pending lawsuits such as the one in the Lincoln S&amp;L
case. DeConcini dropped that feature as he pushed for wider
support, but there have been hints that it might be restored on the
floor.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., backed the bill but told the committee
he would oppose it on the floor if the retroactive feature were
restored.
   DeConcini said he has been ``subjected to attacks that I am
doing this for reasons of a savings and loan in Arizona. There is
no basis in that.''
   He is one of five senators under investigation by the Senate
Ethics Committee concerning their contacts with federal regulators
in the $2 billion Lincoln Savings collapse.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, a co-sponsor of the bill, deplored
``reprehensible'' attacks on DeConcini in the press and by members
of both political parties.
   Biden said DeConcini had been in favor of such a measure long
before the Lincoln case surfaced.
   Outside the committee room, William Lerach, an attorney for the
suing Lincoln bondholders, said the committee's action could be a
setback for those already involved in court actions under RICO.

   Democrats are pressing the Bush administration
to push for deeper cuts in U.S. and Soviet forces in Europe beyond
the president's proposal to reduce significantly the superpower's
combat troops.
   Several members of the Senate Armed Services Committee said the
United States should not stand pat once a conventional arms control
pact is reached and adopt Bush's level of 225,000 troops for each
side as the residual total.
   ``It won't take long for the allies to grab all the reductions
and we're going to be sitting over there with a U.S. Army and
virtually no allies and a questionable threat,'' Sen. Sam Nunn,
D-Ga., chairman of the committee, told Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney on Thursday.
   ``Now that would be a curious position,'' Nunn said.
   Hours after Bush's surprise announcement in his State of the
Union speech Wednesday night, Cheney told the committee the Soviet
Union is likely to withdraw all its troops from Europe by the
middle of the decade.
   Cheney estimated the 225,000 U.S. troop level in Europe could be
achieved ``within a year or two certainly'' after an agreement is
ratified. But he said the troops would be sent elsewhere and not
removed from military service.
   However, the defense secretary cautioned against a unilateral
pullout, saying it is important to maintain the NATO alliance and
ensure a peaceful withdrawal.
   ``The Soviet Union remains the only nation on Earth capable of
destroying the United States,'' Cheney said, adding that even if
all Soviet troops leave Eastern Europe, Moscow would retain its
geographic advantage in the event of a European crisis.
   He said it was important not to drop below a certain troop level
in Europe.
   Sen. John Warner of Virginia, the ranking Republican on the
committee, sought and received an assurance from Cheney that the
administration would not consider going beyond Bush's latest
troop-cut proposal in the foreseeable future.
   ``This is the worst possible time to contemplate changes in
strategy,'' Warner said.
   But Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., pressed Cheney about why the
administration would wait for an arms control pact before reducing
troops in light of moves by allies to cut their forces and
pressures in the Eastern bloc for the Soviets to leave.
   ``They're going to get out of Eastern Europe whether they like
it or not without any agreement with the United States. They're
going to kick them out,'' Dixon said. ``And we're waiting here to
do things until we have the agreement.
   ``I'm not saying strip until we're naked. I'm saying do sensible
things now _ here _ in our country _ even without agreements,'' he
said.
   Cheney said the administration recognizes the need to reduce
U.S. forces overseas, and has in fact begun to cut back with plans
to end U.S. operations at several foreign bases.
   ``We are now on the verge of winning one of the greatest
victories in the history of the world without a shot ever being
fired,'' the defense secretary said.
   Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, also used their appearance before the panel to defend the
administration's $292.1 billion military budget for fiscal 1991.
   The spending plan would increase spending for the B-2 stealth
bomber, the Strategic Defense Initiative and two land-based,
nuclear missiles, but cancels some 20 small weapons systems.
   ``The belief that I have is that it is out of balance,'' Sen.
Carl Levin, D-Mich., said, referring to the terminations of
conventional programs and the increase for nuclear weapons.
   The budget, said Levin, ``only partially responds'' to the
lessening Soviet threat.
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., wondered why it was necessary to
spend money for so many strategic weapons ``at this madcap pace.''
   Cheney said the decision to cancel the weapons programs was
based on the high number of existing weapons and the savings from
shutting down production lines. Modernization, however, must not be
abandoned because the Soviets continue to upgrade their class of
high-tech weapons.
   Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., said the defense secretary may have
gone too far in light of the likely cuts the Congress may make in
the budget.
   ``You might be getting too caught up in this experience,'' Lott
said.

<HEAD>Quiet in the Balcony! Conductors Going Batty With Audience Noise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES WEBB</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's a conductor's nightmare: the orchestra is in
the middle of a moving passage when suddenly, from high in the
balcony, a member of the audience is convulsed by a hacking cough.
   It happens all too often, according to conductors at 21
orchestras surveyed about noisy disturbances during their
performances.
   Nineteen of the 23 conductors who answered the survey said they
have been distracted by audience noises while conducting.
   Coughers are the worst, they said.
   ``A lot of times these people get these hacking coughs and just
let them fly, and that's when it gets annoying,'' said George
Hanson, resident conductor at the Atlanta Symphony.
   Jesus Lopez-Cobos, musical director of the Cincinnati Symphony
Orchestra, said he has seen musicians struggling to stifle laughter
during a particularly obnoxious bout of coughing.
   ``When I feel that it is an evening when people are coughing too
much, I try in between the movements to leave a little more time so
that the people have the time to cough or whatever,'' Lopez-Cobos
said.
   The coughing is most prevalent during the current cold and flu
season, Hanson said, but conductors also sniff over audience noises.
   Talking and yammering youngsters were problems No. 2 and 3 on
the most distracting sounds list.
   Kenneth Jean, associate conductor of the Chicago Symphony
Orchestra, said Thursday that many audience noises are signals that
people are getting fidgety.
   And, he said, that's television's mark.
   ``We're used to every 14 minutes having a commercial break,''
said Jean, also music director of the Florida Symphony Orchestra.
   Jean said that in looking through old Chicago Symphony Orchestra
program books from the 1940s, he found programs up to three hours
long, ``which today's audience would probably find intolerable.''
   Today's concerts last about two hours, with intermission, he
said. Even then, some in the audience are sound asleep _ with a
snore here and there.
   How do conductors get quiet?
   Warner-Lambert Co., which sponsored the survey, is distributing
free wax-wrapped Halls Cough Tablets to patrons of the 21
orchestras whose conductors were surveyed. The company finished
compiling the survey this week.
   It's part of the second year of a promotion called ``Silent
Nights at the Symphony.''
   Jean said the free cough drops do more than soothe scratchy
throats _ ``It's like waving a flag to say, `Look guys, we have a
problem''' with noise.
   Some performers are more direct.
   ``I've known of occasions where performers, conductors or
soloists, have stopped, waited, glowered at the audience, to bring
things under control,'' said Albert Webster, executive vice
president and managing director of the New York Philharmonic.
   But Hanson cautioned that orchestras must be careful not to shoo
away patrons who already may consider symphony concerts a tad
high-brow.
   ``We don't want to scare people away by making them think that
if they drop their concert program on the floor they're going to be
shunned for life,'' Hanson said.

<HEAD>Scientists Accuse Bush of Complacency on Global Warming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 700 scientists, including 49 winners
of the Nobel Prize, are accusing President Bush of being complacent
about the threat of global warming and urging him to show greater
leadership on the issue.
   The scientists, representing a broad range of disciplines from
medicine to physics, said in a letter Thursday to Bush that while
``more research on global warming is necessary ... uncertainty is
no excuse for complacency.''
   ``In view of the potential consequences, actions to curb the
introduction of greenhouse gases ... must be initiated immediately.
Only by taking action now can we ensure that future generations
will not be put at risk,'' said the scientists.
   The group represented more than one-third of all members of the
National Academy of Sciences. Among them were 49 Nobel laureates
and 64 recipients of the National Medal of Science.
   Next week, a new round of meetings is to be opened in Washington
of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which is
examining the global warming issue.
   The meeting, expected to be attended by representatives from
more than 60 countries, is part of an effort to reach an
international agreement, perhaps next year, on what to do about
global warming.
   Environmentalists have chided Bush for failing to endorse
specific reductions in so-called ``greenhouse'' gases, especially
carbon dioxide. Some European countries have argued that industrial
nations should commit themselves to at least a 20 percent reduction
of carbon dioxide emissions by the year 2000.
   But the Bush administration has said such a commitment is unwise
because the economic impact has yet to be fully understood. Any
significant reduction in global warming gases would require a major
reduction in industry's reliance on fossil fuels such as coal and
oil.
   Carbon dioxide, primarily from the burning of fossil fuels,
accounts for about half of all greenhouse gases worldwide. The
United States accounts for one-fifth of all greenhouse gas
emissions.
   The letter was circulated among the scientific community by the
Union of Concerned Scientists, which has been critical of the
administration's policy on global warming. Most of the scientists
who signed the appeal are not members of the group, however.
   Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., who has been a vocal critic of the
administration's global warming policy, called the scientists'
letter to Bush ``an extremely powerful statement by an impressive
group'' and said it ``removes any misimpression of the position of
the scientific community'' on the issue.
   While there is widespread agreement among scientists that
man-made pollution is causing a warming of the earth, there is
disagreement over how severe that warming will be and what the
effect it will have on the earth.
   Some scientists have said the earth's temperature could increase
anywhere from 4 to 9 degrees by the middle of the next century.
Warming along the upper range of that estimate would cause serious
coastal flooding and droughts, scientists say.
   Also on Thursday, the International Energy Agency released a
report suggesting that any measures to deal with global warming are
likely to be difficult and expensive, although no specific cost
estimates were provided.
   ``It is clear that the economic costs of meaningful
countermeasures will be very heavy,'' concluded the IEA study.
``Effective economic and technical adjustments will have to be
introduced gradually over years and even decades.''

   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr., is
getting unexpected praise from one of the harshest critics of
Republican environmental policies in recent years.
   House Interior Committee Chairman Morris Udall, who was
regularly at odds with the Reagan administration, said in a letter
sent Thursday to Lujan that he sees ``an encouraging policy shift
in the direction of the Department of the Interior and its
management of coal mining activities.''
   Steve Goldstein, chief spokesman for Lujan, said the letter came
as a surprise.
   ``We have been plugging along for 12 months trying to get people
to notice that things are different at Interior and there is an
environmental tilt,'' he said.
   Goldstein said Lujan decided to reverse several Reagan
administration decisions because they did not fit into the
environmental mandate the secretary and President Bush want the
department to follow.
   ``There is a much greater focus on stewardship in this
administration,'' said Goldstein.
   Critics, including Udall, have said the Reagan administration
favored private interests over public concerns.
   Udall, who is in his 13th year as chairman of the Interior
Committee, often fought with interior secretaries James Watt and
Donald Hodel, who served under Reagan.
   A former congressman, Lujan served on the Interior Committee,
where he was the ranking Republican for several years.
   ``We sat side by side for a good number of years,'' Udall
commented Thursday. ``We both know we'll disagree again along the
way, but when an old friend is doing a good job, I feel moved to
tell him.''
   Environmental groups also have praise for Lujan's leadership.
   ``A lot of it is that they are waking up to the political
realities that the public is interested in having the environment
protected,'' said Skip Deegans, spokesman for the National Wildlife
Federation. ``The situation on coal issues was so antagonistic
during the Reagan administration that nothing was getting done. We
were constantly in litigation with the Office of Surface Mining.''
   Udall, who sponsored the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation
Act, cited five areas for praise:
   _Improvements in the computerized system designed to prevent
violators of the act from obtaining additional mining permits. The
Reagan administration was put under court order to make
improvements, but never did, said Deegans.
   _Abolishing a Reagan proposal to reduce the royalty rate paid
the government on underground coal. It would have saved the coal
industry money but cost the taxpayers.
   _Reversal of a Reagan administration decision to eliminate
certain fees from the royalty base rate paid on coal. That had cost
taxpayers about $70 million, said Udall.
   _Disapproval a change in a Wyoming regulatory program that would
have relieved coal companies of having to return surface-mined
lands to their original contours.
   _Action to stop mining companies from abusing the law that
allows coal to be taken at a cheaper rate if the company happens to
mine it when looking for another mineral in the vicinity. Companies
were pretending to be mining principally for cheaper minerals in
order to get coal, said Udall.

<TEXT>
   Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev, viewed by many
Soviets as a hard-line conservative, has come under unusually harsh
attack by a newspaper that accuses him of lying and clinging to
outdated socialist ideals.
   The weekly Moscow News, which has been at the forefront of
glasnost, or openness, broke a taboo on criticizing standing Soviet
rulers with a long editorial saying Ligachev opposes democracy and
deceives the people.
   A picture accompanying the editorial underscored the critical
tone. It showed the 69-year-old silver-haired Ligachev giving a
Nazi-like salute, with one armed stretched above his head at a
45-degree angle.
   The article, in editions released Thursday, also accused
Ligachev of a wide range of sins, such as glorifying dictator Josef
Stalin and disregarding the people's will.
   The article was unusual not only for its harsh criticism of a
Soviet leader but also for its timing _ just five days before the
Communist Party's powerful Central Committee, of which Ligachev is
a member, holds what is expected to be a stormy session.
   Progressives hope to present an alternative platform, and rumors
are rife that hard-liners might try to make a power play.
   The editorial on Ligachev was given great prominence _ it was
splashed over two pages _ and carried a measure of authority
because it was written by a deputy editor-in-chief, Vitaly
Tretyakov.
   The article outlined the views that have earned Ligachev, an
ethnic Russian, a conservative label and frequently put him on a
slower, more orthodox track than the reform-minded party leader,
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Ligachev repeatedly has denied any discord with Gorbachev and
has rejected the conservative label.
   While many reformers are calling for a multiparty political
system, Ligachev has emphasized preserving the Communist Party's
exclusive hold on power, and has warned that glasnost should not
obscure the achievements of seven decades of Communist rule.
   He has firmly ruled out ownership of private property and has
defended state and collective farms, which critics say contribute
to the dismal performance of Soviet agriculture.
   Tretyakov wrote that Gorbachev's reform program, perestroika,
has turned Ligachev ``from a supporter of the country's progress to
an opponent.''
   He said Ligachev apparently believes the Communists, not the
people at large, are the party's source of power and in doing so,
``obviously diverges from the spirit of the day.''
   Portraying Ligachev as an opponent of democracy, Tretyakov said
his idea of pluralism is to accept only conflicting opinions from
people who support socialism.
   He questioned Ligachev's approach to socialism, saying he favors
what is ``the most unhealthy in socialism.''
   The Politburo member also holds to a ``myth of unity of the
party, the country, the model of socialism.''
   ``Such unity never was, even when it was violently supported by
a Stalinist regime,'' Tretyakov wrote.
   The solutions Ligachev and other conservatives propose, he said,
arise ``not from the achievements of the past but from the
mistakes.''
   He criticized conservatives for acknowledging that Stalin's
repression was wrong but claiming that he saved the Soviet Union
from defeat to the Nazis in World War II. In fact, Tretyakov said,
it could be argued that Stalin made the country vulnerable to
attack and that it was saved in spite of, not because of, the
dictator.
   Conservatives, he said, believe communism will be ``built, I'm
afraid, on the blood shed not only in 1937 but also in 1989 in
Tbilisi.'' He referred to the height of Stalin's bloody campaign of
terror in the 1930s and a Soviet army attack on pro-independence
demonstrators in the Georgian capital last April.

   When Sen. Jesse Helms, the conservative
Republican from North Carolina, called Mikhail Gorbachev ``a
colorful and adroit public relations man'' at a Senate hearing, he
found himself alone.
   None of Helms' Foreign Relations Committee colleagues endorsed
the senator's charge Thursday that the Soviet leader's reform
program excludes freedom.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III sat placidly in the
witness chair and let the criticism of the Soviet president pass,
although he did tell Helms he would ask in Moscow next week about
allegations the Soviets are sending new weapons to Nicaragua and
Cuba.
   Baker had just finished reading a statement endorsing ``the
reformers'' in Moscow, pledging U.S. technical and other support,
and warning:
   ``If we fail to support the principles that brought us this far,
we could end up living in a future that resembles the past _ the
past of Cold War and the conflicts that preceded it.''
   A year ago, Helms's reservations might have been echoed by the
administration.
   President Bush held out for months against responding to
Gorbachev's overtures for troop reductions in Europe. He did not
reply until June, and only Wednesday night in his State of the
Union speech sweetened his offer of last year to get down to
275,000 on each side.
   Reflecting the reality that the Red Army could be out of
Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland before a treaty is concluded,
Bush called for further cuts _ ceilings of 225,000 with a limit of
195,000 U.S. and Soviet soldiers in Central Europe.
   A year ago, on Baker's first trip to Europe, his closest aides
were advising reporters that the U.S. allies shared the view that
Gorbachev was adept at public relations and had converted U.S.
proposals for easing tensions to his own use.
   All that has changed now.
   One of those same aides acknowledged Wednesday night that the
democratic revolutions in Eastern Europe had created ``new
realities.'' If there was any resistance to Bush's latest proposal
to cut U.S. and Soviet forces, it would come from the Western
allies _ not Moscow.
   Baker, who will hold talks in the Soviet capital next Thursday
and Friday with Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and
possibly Gorbachev, was unqualified in his support for the Soviet
leader.
   ``We seek to probe for points of mutual advantage with the
Soviet Union,'' he told the Foreign Relations Committee, ``turning
areas of conflict into areas of cooperation wherever possible. In
this way, we will benefit ourselves as well as the reformers in
Moscow.''
   Some of the Democrats urged the Bush administration to move
faster.
   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, for instance, is keen on
Gorbachev's proposal to hold a 35-nation summit meeting next year.
Biden said it would be a good opportunity to discuss the
elimination of all foreign forces from Europe.
   Baker's response was to give the idea qualified support. First
he would want the troop reduction treaty completed. And he would
want the Soviets to recognize free elections as a human right.
   But Baker was receptive, and he is expected to develop the theme
during his trip next week to Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union.
   He also may be able to work out with Shevardnadze answers to
some of the questions still in the way of a U.S.-Soviet treaty to
reduce long-range nuclear missiles, bombers and submarines.
   And with the Soviet foreign minister, Baker will be looking for
a solution to the war in Afghanistan between the Marxist government
and U.S.-backed guerrillas.
   On several fronts, slow to act at first, the Bush administration
is finding the Gorbachev revolution irresistible.

   Federal agents probing a series of mail
bombs have interviewed three welders about their relationship with
a salvage store owner under investigation in the case.
   The welders said Thursday that the FBI agents mainly wanted to
know about their ties to Robert Wayne O'Ferrell, for whom all have
done work. One welder said agents took nail samples from his shop.
   The FBI, which established an outpost in this southeast Alabama
community nearly two weeks ago, has declined to comment about
specifics of the case.
   Part-time welder James Locke of nearby New Brockton said he told
two investigators that he's known O'Ferrell about four years and
has occasionally done work for him, repairing such salvage store
items as metal chairs, desks and shelves.
   Locke said the agents took some samples of materials he uses at
home to reload shotgun shells, and may have removed some nails from
his scrap metal pile. ``They rooted around my nail caddy,'' he said.
   Authorities have said the bombs, mailed to Alabama, Florida and
Georgia in December, contained finishing nails. Eleventh U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Robert Vance and Savannah, Ga.,
attorney Robert Robinson died in separate bombings.
   Locke said he had no knowledge of the bombs, other than what he
has seen in the media. He added he did not believe O'Ferrell, who
has been questioned extensively in the case, could have been
involved in the attacks.
   ``Like I told them (the investigators), I thought Wayne was like
a brother to the Lord _ a Christian,'' Locke said.
   Agents also questioned Joe King and Roy Reeves last week at
their Enterprise shops, but did not remove any items during those
meetings.
   Meanwhile Thursday, FBI agents in Enterprise continued their now
familiar daily routine of scouring the area for an old typewriter
they believe was used to write letters associated with the bombs.
The typewriter allegedly also was used by O'Ferrell.
   Agents were seen Thursday inspecting typewriters at a downtown
pawn shop as well as at nearby Fort Rucker, where a search has been
conducted for the better part of this week.
   O'Ferrell, who has not been charged, has said he had nothing to
do with the bombs. He reiterated Thursday that federal agents ``are
barking up the wrong tree.''

   The dollar edged up against the yen Friday, while
the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose sharply.
   The dollar closed at 144.95 yen, up 0.45 yen from Thursday's
close of 144.50 yen. After opening at 144.93 yen, the currency
ranged between 144.77 yen and 144.98 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 443.73
points, or 1.19 percent, closing the week at 37,650.15.
   Currency dealers said yen-dollar trading was slow in comparison
with cross trading. Many market players were waiting the release of
U.S. employment figures for January, due out in Washington later
Friday, they said.
   Some economists predict the U.S. civilian unemployment rate will
rise to 5.4 percent, up 0.1 percent from 5.3 percent in December.
   European currencies, including the West German mark, the British
pound and the Swiss franc, strengthened against the dollar, said a
dealer with Mitsubishi Bank, who spoke on condition he not be named.
   He and other dealers attributed the European currencies'
strength to Thursday's State of the Union address by President
Bush, in which he proposed new reductions in U.S. and Soviet combat
forces in Europe.
   On the stock exchange, the Nikkei index started higher on small
buying for domestic issues including construction, machinery and
shipbuilding stocks, securities dealers said.
   Dealers attributed the index's gains to the firmness in Japanese
government bond prices.

   Gov. George Mickelson, recognizing the
historical hurt suffered by Indians, smoked a peace pipe with
tribal leaders and proclaimed a year of reconciliation in 1990, a
century after the Wounded Knee massacre.
   The governor and representatives of eight Sioux tribes drew
deeply and passed the pipe Thursday as they sat in a circle around
a buffalo skull and other items in the center of the state Capitol
rotunda.
   The members of the South Dakota Legislature and hundreds of
other spectators applauded as Mickelson and the tribal leaders
completed the ceremony. They then signed a proclamation designating
1990 as a time for healing wounds that have festered between
Indians and non-Indians for a century.
   During the state's centennial celebration last year, Indians
refused to take part, claiming they had nothing to celebrate. They
have been at odds with state government over issues such as hunting
and fishing rights, law enforcement on reservation highways and
contracts for state services.
   The governor decided it was time to bury the tomahawk.
   Mickelson said he gathered the state lawmakers and the Indian
leaders together to ``make this truly a year of reconciliation that
marks a new beginning.''
   ``I believe it places a responsibility on all of us throughout
this year to make a personal commitment,'' the governor said.
   Indians are going through especially tough times in the state.
On South Dakota's nine reservations, unemployment approaches 80
percent, and alcoholism, drugs and health care are severe problems.
   Four reservation counties rank among the nation's very poorest
in terms of per capita income.
   Tim Giago, publisher of the weekly Lakota Times, had challenged
Mickelson to proclaim 1990 as a year to help ease racial discord
between Indian and white people in South Dakota. Mickelson thanked
the Indian publisher for issuing the challenge.
   In the proclamation, Mickelson said that as South Dakota begins
its second century of statehood, people must also remember that the
creation of the state was a sad time for Indians.
   In December 1890, a little more than a year after South Dakota
became a state, Sioux leader Sitting Bull was killed and nearly 300
Sioux men, women and children were killed by U.S. government troops
in the Wounded Knee massacre.
   ``Strife between the cultures in South Dakota has, for 100
years, been of grave concern and continues to be of grave
concern,'' the governor said in the proclamation.
   The 100th anniversary of the tragic events offers an opportunity
for Indians and non-Indians to put aside their fears and mistrust,
build friendships, cooperate, learn about each other's culture and
develop a respect and understanding that will grow in the next
century, Mickelson said.
   More than 6 percent of the state's population _ or about 45,000
people _ are Indians, according to the 1980 U.S. Census.
   Mickelson said he realizes state government and the tribal
governments won't settle all their disputes in the next year, but
many of the problems might be resolved.
   A council of Indians and non-Indians should put together a broad
plan by March 1 for celebrating the year of reconciliation, the
governor said, and each South Dakotan should think about ways to
bridge the cultural gap between Indians and non-Indians in the long
run.
   The proclamation was signed by the governor and representatives
of the Flandreau-Santee Sioux, Oglala Sioux, Rosebud Sioux, Yankton
Sioux, Standing Rock Sioux, Cheyenne River, the Lower Brule Tribe
and the Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe. A Crow Creek Sioux
representative didn't show up for the ceremony, but officials said
a tribal representative may sign it later.
   The ceremony opened when two Sioux men sang the ``Lakota Flag
Song'' in a high-pitched, haunting, wavering harmony, and Sioux
military veterans carried in the U.S. flag, a Sioux eagle staff
adorned with feathers, and other flags.
   It ended with the Sioux men singing the ``Peace Song.''

<HEAD>HUD Suspends Major Developer; Cites Investigation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Jesse Jackson supporter who runs a housing
company suspended from government business wrote off a $30,000 debt
owed by Jackson's 1988 presidential campaign, according to a
published report.
   A. Bruce Rozet, a prominent Democratic fund-raiser and president
of Associated Financial Corp. of California, released the campaign
from a debt it owed to a hotel that Rozet partly owns, according to
former hotel workers quoted in today's editions of The Washington
Post.
   The hotel transaction was not reported to the Federal Election
Commission as either an outstanding debt or contribution as
required under the election laws.
   The Department of Housing and Urban Development said Thursday
that AFC, one of the nation's largest subsidized housing landlords,
was suspended from future government work because of a fraud
investigation.
   HUD, in a letter to one of the company's affiliates, said the
government ``has information indicating irregularities of a serious
nature'' and the company and its affiliates were being investigated.
   AFC leads more than 40 affiliated companies that control nearly
50,000 units of federally assisted housing. Rozet was a Jackson
delegate to the Democratic National Convention.
   Rozet, in a statement and additional comments issued through a
spokesman, called HUD's action ``pure harassment for political
reasons'' that ultimately would harm the low-income families the
agency is supposed to serve.
   He denied any wrongdoing and accused HUD of taking the action to
avoid a hearing scheduled for next week on lesser sanctions against
an AFC affiliate.
   The Post cited former workers for the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel
who said the debt was written off after the hotel was able to
collect just $45,000 of $75,000 the Jackson campaign owed the
hotel. The newspaper said two employees saw a company memorandum
saying the unpaid balance was a ``gift'' from Rozet.
   Jackson told the newspaper he was not aware Rozet helped out
with hotel expenses. ``Absolutely not,'' Jackson said. ``First off,
we didn't need that kind favor, and second, it would have been
illegal.''
   Such a contribution would be illegal because it comes from a
corporation. Individual contributions are limited by law to $1,000
per election per candidate.
   On the suspension announced Thursday, HUD General Counsel
Francis Keating said AFC and its affiliates were being investigated
by the department's inspector general. Law enforcement sources told
The Associated Press that the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles
was also investigating the companies.
   Those sources, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said
Charles Bazarian, a man Rozet used as a property scout who later
was convicted of skimming money a from HUD-assisted project, was
cooperating with investigators.
   But the sources declined to discuss the substance of the probe,
and the Los Angeles prosecutor handling it, Lee Weidman, declined
comment.
   Rozet and AFC have had a number of run-ins with HUD in the past
decade, including several in the last year, and Rozet has said
first-year HUD Secretary Jack Kemp has allowed bureaucrats with old
grudges against the company to dictate HUD policy toward AFC.
   Kemp visited one AFC property shortly after taking office last
year and termed conditions there ``scandalous.'' Kemp's top deputy
also has called Rozet and his companies ``slumlords.''
   But community leaders in several areas with AFC properties have
defended the company, and Rozet often is called on by Congress as
an expert on housing policy. One of Rozet's biggest defenders in
Congress is Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., for whom Rozet has been a
major fund-raiser.
   HUD announced the suspension in a letter to an AFC affiliate,
Housing Resources Management Inc., which is controlled by Rozet
partner Deane E. Ross.
   Also affected by the suspension are AFC and more that 40 related
development and investment companies involved in the purchase and
management of government-assisted housing and the syndication of
tax credits developers of such projects receive from the government.
   AFC, speaking on behalf of its affiliate, denied Housing
Resources Management was involved in any improper activities. Even
if those allegations were true, AFC said a suspension was
unwarranted because the allegations involved about $35,000.

   Safety experted their efforts to convince
drivers and passengers to buckle uged by a claim that rear-seat lap
belts can cause devastating injuries, especially to children.
   The Institute for Injury Reduction on Thursday launched a
campaign to fit older cars wit shoulder straps, contending lap
belts used alo than 1,000 serious injuries a year.
   Benjamin Kelley, the institute's president, said many victims of
serious lap belt injuries are children because they are more likely
to sit in the rear seats of automobiles than adults.
   The institute was founded two years ago by a group of lawyers
who specialize in representing accident victims.
   Children strapped into the rear seats of cars often are killed
or injured in slow-speed crashes by the sudden pressure of the belt
on the stomach and spine, he said.
   But he said others in the car often emerge uninjured, sometimes
when they are wearing no belt at all.
   But safety experts said many lives haved by seat belts, an
advance that could be reversed if people stop using them out of
needless fear.
   ``We don't want someone to think that it's safer to sit in that
back seat with no belt at all,'' said Jerry Ralph Curry,
administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration. ``Our concern is that by scaring the public,
parents will take a child out of the seat belt and that a child
will t killed.''he said.
   In Fort Worth, Texas, officials attending a meeting of the
National Highway Transportation Safety Association were just as
blunt.
   ``The claims made at the Washington press conference can causey
needless deaths and serious injuries,'' said Beverlee Anderson,
spokeswoman for the safety association meeting and director of the
Tennessee Traffic Safety Coalition.
   The association said the ``largeevidence shows more lives are
saved by properlyap belts than by no restraining device at all.
   ``We estimate that lap belts in passenger cars saved about lives
and prevented over 1,400 serious injuries in 1988,'' the statement
said.
   Kelley did not advocate not using seat belts, acknowledging they
do save lives.
   But he said that quickly fitting the nation's automobiles with
shoulder straps would help eliminate seat belt injuries. He said
such injuries can cause permanent paralysis through spinal damage
or result in serious damage to abdominal muscles.
   ``Neither government nor the car industry are vigorously acting
to see that existing cars are rapidly equipped with safe, effective
rear-seat lap-shoulder belts,'' Kelley said.
   Kelley urged the government to urge auto manufacturers and
dealers to make shoulder-strap retrofit kits quickly available to
the public at affordable prices and to launch a publicity and
advertising campaign to convince drivers to install them.
   Under a rule adopted last year by the traffic safety
administration, new cars must be equipped with rear-seat shoulder
belts.
   But Kelley said the rule does not apply to 140 million older
cars already on the road.

   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and
activists who toppled Czechoslovakia's hard-line Communist
leadership are among the nominees for the 1990 Nobel Peace Prize,
according to newspaper reports.
   The nominations closed Thursday and remain secret. The
Oslo-based Norwegian Nobel Institute, as usual, refused to discuss
candidates for the 71st prize.
   However, the Norwegian news media said the Soviet president was
nominated for the third year in a row.
   Also among the reported nominees are Chinese students and their
leader Chai Ling, whose pro-democracy demonstrations were crushed
in June; jailed South African black nationalist leader Nelson
Mandela; and former President Ronald Reagan.
   News reports said there were three Czech nominees: the students
who demonstrated for reforms; former dissident and now President
Vaclav Havel; and former Foreign Minister Jiri Hajek. Havel and
Hajek, both nominated last year, were signers of the human rights
manifesto Charter 77.
   The Norwegian Nobel Institute said 80 valid nominations were
received for 56 individuals and 24 organizations. The number may
increase as other nominations postmarked by Feb. 1 arrive, said an
institute official.
   The prize, first awarded in 1901, is presented on Dec. 10, the
anniversary of the 1896 death of the Swedish inventor of dynamite,
Alfred Nobel. He founded the prize to honor those working toward
disarmament and arranging peace conferences.
   In recent years, the peace prize also has been used to encourage
human rights.
   The selection is kept secret until the official announcement,
usually in October.
   Candidates for the $428,000 prize may be nominated by previous
laureates, members of parliaments, or political science faculty
members of selected universities.
   The 1989 award to Tibet's religious and political leader, the
Dalai Lama, was broadly praised outside China, committee chairman
Egil Aarvik said. The Buddhist monk advocates non-violence in
Tibet's 40-year struggle against Chinese occupation.

<HEAD>Consumers Get Conflicting Advice on Several Foods</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Olive Oil, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The study published today in the Journal of the American Medical
Association linking olive oil consumption with lower blood
cholesterol, blood sugar and blood pressure is the latest volley in
what often seems like a contradictory barrage of news about what
constitutes healthful eating.
   Bonnie Liebman, director of nutrition for the Washington-based
consumer group Center for Science in the Public Interest, advises
patience.
   ``Scientists are used to having studies with opposite results
and they know that, over time, the truth emerges,'' Ms. Liebman
said. ``Consumers have only recently accepted science and health as
news, and they aren't used to that.''
   With that in mind, here is a list of some recent reports linking
various foods to health problems or benefits:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   OAT BRAN: One could find oat bran everywhere, even in beer,
after reports emerged indicating that eating it helped reduce
blood-cholesterol levels and the risk of heart attack. A recent
study, however, said the apparent benefits of oat bran resulted
from its replacement of fatty foods in people's diets, not from a
special property of the grain itself, and that other cereals work
just as well to reduce artery-clogging excess cholesterol in the
bloodstream.
   RICE BRAN: Although some earlier studies indicated that rice
bran had cholesterol-lowering properties, a researcher financed by
the rice industry searching for such benefits has said he didn't
find any, and advised people trying to lower cholesterol levels to
reduce fat intake, get to a normal weight and exercise.
   MILK: Public concern about the safety of milk was sparked after
two independent surveys found supplies in several areas
contaminated with antibiotics and sulfa drugs used to treat sick
cattle. The government says it sees no public health threat but
researchers are concerned about the continuing possibility of
contamination from detectable and undetectable veterinary drugs.
   COFFEE: Often subject to scrutiny, coffee made news recently
after a study revealed that older couples who drink coffee appear
to be more sexually active than elderly non-coffee drinkers. One
researcher suggested that coffee stimulates the central nervous
system and relaxes certain muscles, but also said it was possible
that coffee drinkers were ``more liberal in their sexual
behavior.'' Some studies have linked coffee to heart disease, high
cholesterol levels and pancreatic cancer, while others have found
no such relationship.
   FISH OIL: A recent study found that large doses of fish oil can
return mild high blood pressure to normal levels. However, the
subjects had to take three tablespoons each day of liquid herring
oil, which caused belching and a lingering fishy aftertaste. The
amount of fish oil used, equivalent to 50 fish oil gel capsules,
was much higher than that recommended by capsule manufacturers. In
fact, when taken at the dose usually suggested, the oil did not
help.
   Despite their encouraging findings, the researchers said people
should not exchange blood pressure pills for fish oil until doctors
know more. They also advised people not to substitute cod liver
oil, which contains too much vitamin A and D and not enough omega-3
fatty acids. Oily ocean fish, such as herring and mackerel, are
rich in omega-3 fatty acids, the particular variety of fish oil
that appears to be good for the heart.

<HEAD>Study Finds Labs Double Bills for Medicare</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Medicare testing laboratories are billing the
government program nearly twice what they charge physicians for the
same services, according to a report by the inspector general of
the Department of Health and Human Services.
   Medicare could reduce significantly the more than $3.9 billion
it pays annually for lab services if the program were to pay rates
comparable to what physicians pay, said the report by Inspector
General Richard Kusserow.
   ``Because Medicare is such a large volume payer of tests, we
believe a strong case could be made for Medicare paying less than
physicians. Certainly, the program should not be asked to pay
more,'' said the report released Thursday.
   The review of 4,120 lab billings found Medicare payment rates
were overall about 90 percent higher than the amounts paid by
physicians, mostly because of the way Medicare pays for packages of
tests ordered as a group.
   Physicians are offered deep discounts for these groups of tests,
called profiles, but Medicare pays separately for each test
according to its schedule of fees. Of 1,525 profiles reviewed,
Medicare paid 176 percent more than physicians for the same tests,
the report said.
   Nineteen of the 26 independent clinical laboratories surveyed
had separate price lists for physicians and third-party payers,
including Medicare. Of the seven labs studied in detail, all billed
Medicare at least twice as much as physicians for the same tests
and one charged Medicare five times more.
   Labs most often said they charged Medicare higher prices because
they said it costs more to bill and get reimbursement from
Medicare, the report said.
   Representatives at one lab complained that after they billed for
about 500 Medicare patients on a single computer tape, they
received 500 separate checks from Medicare, rather than one, as its
physician customers would have issued.
   But the inspector general suggested some of the industry's
complaints were unfounded, pointing out that to simplify billing,
Medicare eliminated co-insurance and deductibles for lab services
in 1984.
   Medicare serves about 33 million elderly and disabled Americans,
and accounts for an estimated 10 percent to 20 percent of all lab
tests.
   The program paid $3.9 billion for lab services in 1987, the
latest year for which figures were available. This was a 22 percent
increase over 1986.

<HEAD>Parkinson's Disease Patient Treated With Transplanted Fetal Brain

   A man with severe Parkinson's disease showed
marked improvement after receiving a transplant of brain tissue
from an aborted fetus into his own brain, European researchers
report.
   The transplanted fetal brain tissue apparently thrived and is
producing dopamine, a brain chemical that is essential for normal
controlled muscle movements, the researchers reported in a study
published in Science magazine today.
   Olle Lindvall of the University Hospital in Lund, Sweden, chief
author of the report, told The Washington Post that the study,
involving a single patient, ``is very exciting and promising
news.'' But he cautioned that the study ``does not prove that we
can get this effect in other patients or sustain it in this one.''
   Parkinson's disease occurs when areas of the brain degenerate
and stop producing dopamine, a neurotransmitter essential for
carrying signals from one part of the brain to another. By
transplanting fetal brain tissue into the affected area,
researchers hope to restore the production of dopamine.
   Clinical trials using transplanted fetal tissue have been
conducted for the last two years and some improvement has been
reported earlier in a few patients.
   But Lindvall said in Science that the earlier cases did not
determine if the transplanted tissue survived in the host brain or
if dopamine production was restored. Some of the improvement, he
said, could have been the result of the surgery itself.
   The Swedish study involved a 49-year-old man described as
``severely affected'' with the muscular rigidity and tremors
typical of Parkinson's disease. His right arm was most affected.
   Brain scans showed that the left side of his brain was deficient
in dopamine production, and that the right side of the brain was
less affected.
   The man, who first developed the disease in 1977, was helped for
a time by a drug called L-dopa, which is chemically changed into
dopamine in the body. But starting in 1984, the effect of the drug
began to diminish, a characteristic of that drug.
   To perform the transplant, doctors removed brain tissue from
four fetuses within four hours of routine suction abortions. The
tissue was treated chemically and then injected by needle into
three sites in the affected part of the brain of the Parkinsonian
patient.
   ``From two to three months after surgery, the patient exhibited
a marked improvement of movement speed ... in the right arm and a
similar change (although of lesser magnitude) in the left arm,''
the Science study reports.
   The improvement, the study said, ``is consistent with the slow
development of a growing graft.''
   The researchers said that the patient also now responds better
and for a longer period of time to treatment by the drug L-dopa.
   A brain scan, which can detect a chemical used as a tracer,
showed five months after surgery that there was a dramatic increase
in the amount of dopamine present in the patient's brain.
   Eight months after the transplant, the patient continues to
improve.
   Future assessment, the study said, ``will show whether these
neurons (the transplanted tissue) can survive permanently, or if
they will be destroyed either by the underlying disease process or
by immunological rejection.''
   Eugene Redmond Jr., a Yale School of Medicine professor of
psychiatry, said clinical improvement found in the study ``is very
clear and well documented.''
   ``The therapy could become the best hope for many people,'' he
told The Washington Post, although he cautioned that only a single
patient was used and final conclusions cannot yet be drawn. Redmond
and some colleagues expect to complete a study of fetal cell
transplants in 20 patients within two years.
   Fetal tissue experimentation slowed in the United States last
year after the Bush administration banned the use of federal funds
for research into transplantation of any fetal tissue into humans.
   Another researcher, Dr. Curt Freed of the University of Colorado
Medical Center in Denver, said he got similar results with a
52-year-old man with Parkinson's disease. Those results will be
published in April.
   Ten researchers, including four from England and one from
Switzerland, co-authored the Science study with Lindvall. Science
is the journal of the American Association for the Advancement of
Science.

   A woman convicted of murdering her infant
baby, the second daughter she had reported abducted by a masked
gunman in three years, was sentenced to life in prison despite her
request for the death penalty.
   Jurors said Thursday they spared Paula Marie Sims her life
because they did not believe she was soley responsible for the
April 29 death of 6-week-old Heather Lee and that she might
implicate other people in the slaying.
   Jury foreman Harold William Ryan Jr. said jurors didn't believe
her story that a masked gunman stole Heather, just three years
after Mrs. Sims' firstborn daughter, 13-day-old Loralei,
disappeared under nearly identical circumstances.
   ``Mrs. Sims was well-rehearsed,'' Ryan said. ``But I guess we
just didn't believe her.''
   Mrs. Sims, 30, was convicted Tuesday of first-degree murder,
obstruction of justice and concealing a homicide in Heather Lee's
death. Her sentence includes no chance of parole.
   Mrs. Sims told her attorney Thursday she no longer cared to
live, and urged him to let the jury issue a death sentence.
   ``She still maintains her innocence, but says, `I don't have any
reason to go on, I don't have any reason to live,''' defense
attorney Donald Groshong told the courtroom before sentencing.
   ``Whether I'm innocent doesn't matter _ they can go ahead and
execute me,'' Groshong quoted his client as saying.
   But juror John Joplin said the jury was not moved by Groshong's
plea for mercy and warnings to ``ignore the angry mob outside
crying for blood.''
   Instead, it was the unanswered questions surrounding the two
deaths that spared Mrs. Sims, Joplin said.
   ``She killed her children and she has to live with it the rest
of her life,'' Joplin said. ``By not sentencing her to death, maybe
she'll help lead police to the others involved in the killings.''
   The sentencing did not end legal problems facing Mrs. Sims and
her husband, 37-year-old Robert Sims, who may be charged in the
April slaying, said Madison County State's Attorney William Haine.
   Sims has not been charged in either infants' death and he
retains custody of the couple's 2-year-son, Randy.
   Charges of obstruction of justice and concealment of a homicide
await Mrs. Sims in Loralei's death. No murder charges have been
filed in that case.
   Mrs. Sims, of Alton, near St. Louis, testified both her
daughters were abducted by a masked gunman while her husband was at
work.
   Mrs. Sims reported Heather was abducted April 29 from the
Simses' home in Alton. Her body was found May 3 in a trash barrel
across the Mississippi River in nearby West Alton, Mo. An autopsy
indicated she had been suffocated and her body subsequently frozen.
   Loralei was reported abducted June 17, 1986, from the Simses'
former home in Brighton, a few miles from Alton. A badly decomposed
body identified as Loralei was found a week later in a wooded
ravine near the house.

<HEAD>Castro Says Bush Must Have OK'd Freighter Attack</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Fidel Castro said President Bush
must have approved a U.S. Coast Guard attack on a Cuban freighter
suspected of drug-running, the official Cuban news agency reported.
   Castro welcomed the freighter's crew as heroes who had won a
``skirmish against imperialism'' when they returned to Havana
Thursday from the Mexican port of Tampico, where they left their
bullet-scarred boat.
   A U.S. Coast Guard cutter opened fire on the freighter Hermann
with a machine gun and cannon after it refused demands to halt in
the Gulf of Mexico. The Coast Guard let the boat go when it entered
Mexican waters Wednesday.
   On Thursday, the Mexican Foreign Ministry issued a statement
saying the Navy had ``meticulously'' searched the freighter twice
and it showed no sign of drugs. Mexican officials seached the boat
at the request of U.S. officials.
   Castro met the crew at the airport Thursday and accompanied them
to a downtown rally, according to the Cuban news agency Prensa
Latina.
   The Communist leader said the decision to fire on the Hermann
must have come from the very highest level in Washington.
   ``President Bush must have been consulted,'' he said, according
to Prensa Latina dispatches monitored in Mexico City.
   The official Mexican news agency Notimex said 60,000 people were
at the welcoming rally near the U.S. interest section in Havana,
which handles U.S. diplomatic affairs in Cuba. Prensa Latina said
the crowd numbered in the ``hundreds of thousands.''
   Castro praised the crew for their courage, Prensa Latina said.
He said their refusal to stop and allow the Coast Guard to board
and search ``was a demonstration of the courage of our people. It's
what I would have expected in the face of a Yankee attack,'' Prensa
Latina reported.
   Castro also called the incident a ``grave provocation.'' Cuba
has filed a protest.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III has said the incident
``was not an attack and a provocation.''
   ``We were engaged in a legal law enforcement activity,'' he said.
   U.S. officials say the 250-foot freighter, which is registered
in Panama, ``fit the profile'' of a drug-smuggling ship. Cuban
officials said the boat carried 10 tons of chromium, a metallic
element used in electroplating and alloys.
   In July, Cuban authorities executed four military officers on
drug-running charges.
   Capt. Aristides Palma Palma, head of port operations in Tampico,
said the Hermann will undergo repairs in Tampico. He said it was
hit by at least 50 bullets.
   The freighter's captain, Diego Sanchez Serrano, filed a damage
claim with Tampico harbor authorities saying the Hermann, owned by
the Cuban Guamar Shipping Co., and its crew had been the victims of
a terrorist act, the Excelsior news service in Mexico said.

   House Democratic leaders honoring Rosa Parks
say her refusal to move to the back of the bus 35 years ago, a key
moment in the civil rights struggle, changed the nation.
   ``Rosa, let me thank you personally for sitting down so long ago
so I could stand here today,'' said Rep. Bill Gray, D-Pa., the
House Democratic whip, in honoring Mrs. Parks on Thursday. Gray
credited her with triggering changes that have allowed blacks such
as himself to attain high office.
   Mrs. Parks' 77th birthday on Sunday will be marked by a
black-tie national tribute at the John F. Kennedy Center for the
Performing Arts in Washington.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley and other House Democrats appeared
with Mrs. Parks at a news conference in anticipation of that event.
   ``There are few people that can say they changed the nation.
Rosa Parks changed the nation,'' Foley said.
   Mrs. Parks' refusal to surrender her seat to a white passenger
on a Montgomery, Ala., city bus on Dec. 1, 1955, led to a city-wide
bus boycott that last 381 days.
   The boycott triggered other protests and propelled Martin Luther
King Jr. to national attention and to the leadership of the civil
rights movement.
   Since 1965, Mrs. Parks has lived in Detroit and worked in the
office of Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich. For the last three years she
has run the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development,
whose aim is to help young people.

   President Bush has withdrawn the nomination of
GOP fund-raiser Joy Silverman as ambassador to Barbados after
receiving complaints from Capitol Hill that she lacked
qualifications.
   Bush instead named Mrs. Silverman to the board of trustees of
the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.
   Mrs. Silverman, a New Yorker who had no job history, was one of
several Bush ambassadorial appointees who critics said were being
rewarded for her contribution to Bush's political campaign.
   Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., last year produced a list of $300,000
worth of political contributions to Republican campaigns by Mrs.
Silverman, her husband, Jeffery Silverman, and her husband's wood
products company, Playgem.
   Federal Election Commission records show she gave $100,000 to
the Republican National Committee in 1988.
   Ambassadorial appointments require Senate confirmation. The
Kennedy Center post does not.

<HEAD>Air Force Announces Civilian Drug Testing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force expects to begin tests by the
end of the month on some 24,000 civilian workers holding sensitive
jobs who have been deemed eligible for random drug testing, the
Pentagon says.
   ``We're looking at testing approximately 6,000 employees per
year,'' an Air Force spokesman, Maj. Lou Figueroa, said Thursday.
   Employees who test positive will be removed from their jobs and
referred to a substance-abuse counseling program. They also will be
subject to ``appropriate disciplinary action,'' which could include
a written reprimand, suspension or firing, a Pentagon statement
said.
   The program is designed ``to ensure employees refrain from using
illegal drugs on or off duty,'' and also will include applicants
for the posts deemed to be sensitive, the statement said.
   All of the tests will screen for marijuana or cocaine use. Tests
for amphetamines, opiates and PCP can be ordered, the spokesman
said.
   The Air Force has some 566,000 military personnel and 260,000
civilian employees. All active-duty military personnel have been
subject to random drug tests since 1981.
   The Air Force has begun bargaining with the affected labor
unions on the matter, the statement said.
   The program is designed to affect those civilians occupying or
applying for positions that directly relate to ``the public health
and safety, the protection of life and property, law enforcement
and national security,'' the statement said.

   Woolite was one of a number of products used to help Junior Lamb

<HEAD>Armenian Patriarch Of Jerusalem Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Armenian patriarch of Jerusalem, Yeghishe
Derderian, spiritual leader of thousands of Armenians in Israel,
the occupied lands and Jordan, has died of a heart attack. He was
80.
   Derderian died Thursday in his home in the St. James Convent in
Jerusalem's walled Old City, church secretary Father George
Hintlian said. Derderian had been ill with the flu for two days, he
said.
   Bells of mourning pealed in the Old City's Armenian Quarter to
announce the death, and dozens of congregation members rushed to
the convent.
   Derderian was the spiritual leader of 8,000 Armenians in Israel,
the Israeli-occupied West Bank, and Jordan. He was also one of
three custodians of Jerusalem's holy places, along with the Greek
Orthodox and Latin patriarchs.
   Derderian was born in the eastern Turkish city of Van and lost
all his relatives at the hands of the Turks in 1915 during what
Armenians view as a massacre.
   Armenians claim the Turks killed 1.5 million ethnic Armenians
between 1915 and 1923 during the days of the Ottoman Empire.
   Turks counter that the number of dead is at most 600,000 and
that most died from disease and hunger during deportation from
eastern Turkey to Syria and Lebanon during World War 1.
   
   During January celebrations of the Armenian Christmas, Derderian
accused Soviet authorities of not doing enough to stop the violence
in Azerbaijan, where Azerbaijani Moslems were attacking Christian
Armenians.
   Derderian came to Jerusalem in 1922 to study at the St. James
Theological Seminary. He served as dean of the seminary before
being named deputy patriarch in 1949. In 1960, he became patriarch
of Jerusalem.
   Derderian also wrote 22 books, including biographies of
religious figures and poetry, Hintlian said.
   The Armenian Church is one of the Eastern rite churches which
are organized along ethnic lines. They accept the authority of the
pope but have considerable autonomy in ritual and other matters.
   Derderian was not married.
   Hintlian said the funeral was tentatively scheduled for the
middle of next week, adding that hundreds of clergymen from abroad
would attend.

<TEXT>
   Prosecutors are bringing charges against
more and more pregnant women who take drugs, but a lawyer for one
woman accused of delivering cocaine through the womb says the war
on drugs is ``going from hysteria to ... absurdity.''
   Authorities in areas where expectant mothers have been arrested
say they're turning to criminal law as a last resort because
nothing else worked in stopping the growing number of
cocaine-addicted babies.
   ``When you have seen these children shake, it gets to you,''
said Lt. Stephan Banakas, narcotics chief for the Pensacola Police
Department. ``If it's through arrest or the threat of arrests ...,
whatever it's taken to get people to take care of their children,
it's working.''
   The controversy has emerged from the growing use of crack
cocaine around the nation, but mothers addicted to other drugs also
have been charged. In Wyoming on Thursday, a judge dismissed a
child abuse charge against a pregnant woman who drank excessively.
The judge said the prosecutor did not establish that the woman's
drinking habits injured her unborn baby.
   More than 30 women have been arrested nationwide since the first
mother was convicted of delivering cocaine to her newborn in
central Florida last August, said Alison Marshall, a Washington,
D.C., lawyer.
   Some police and prosecutors said the arrests are a way of
forcing mothers of cocaine babies to get drug treatment. They
contend that some pregnant addicts are going straight because they
fear prosecution.
   But crackdown critics _ they include the American Public Health
Association, National Women's Health Network and National
Organization for Women _ say the arrests are doing more harm than
good.
   The threat of jail is scaring pregnant addicts away from
prenatal care and hospitals, increasing the risks to their babies,
said Robyn Blumner, Florida director of the American Civil
Liberties Union in Miami.
   Some even say the arrests could encourage women to have
abortions or result in ``trash can babies.''
   ``This is the war on drugs going from hysteria to illogical
absurdity,'' said attorney Alan Rapoport of the American Civil
Liberties Union. He is representing Kimberly Hardy, the first woman
in Michigan charged with delivering cocaine to her newborn through
the umbilical cord.
   A District Court judge on Thursday ordered Ms. Hardy to stand
trial after a pediatrician testified that the baby's exposure to
cocaine likely was responsible for his low birthweight, inability
to hold food down and gastrointestinal dysfunction.
   Two days after birth, a drug test showed signs of cocaine in the
baby's urine.
   Critics also contend a nationwide shortage of treatment
facilities for pregnant addicts means women who seek rehabilitation
as a result of the crackdown won't get it.
   In Florida, officials estimate more than 10,000 babies are born
to addicted women each year.
   Authorities in South Carolina and the Florida Panhandle have
been the most aggressive in bringing charges, said Marshall, who
represents the Chicago-based National Association for Perinatal
Addiction Research and Education.
   Police in this Panhandle city have arrested five mothers on
charges of delivering cocaine to their newborn babies.
   Assistant State Attorney Jeff Deen of Sanford contends cocaine
is delivered through the umbilical cord; the violation occurs
during the minute to 90 seconds the baby is outside the womb before
the umbilical cord is cut.
   Deen said his intention is to use prosecution to force women
into drug rehabilitation. One Pensacola woman received 18 months in
prison after pleading no contest to cocaine delivery, but that
sentence was part of a plea bargain and runs concurrently with
terms of equal length in two cases unrelated to drugs or children.
   Three other cases in Pensacola are pending; in the fifth case,
the woman was placed on 15 years' probation.
   At least nine alleged cocaine mothers have been arrested in
Greenville, S.C., said Solicitor Joe Watson who pioneered the
prosecutions in that state. One woman has entered a guilty plea and
was placed on probation. The other cases are pending.
   The South Carolina defendants are charged with child neglect by
passing narcotics to their babies before birth.
   Pensacola has been able to help addicted mothers-to-be because
it has the facilities to treat them, said Elizabeth Myer, client
manager for the Community Drug and Alcohol Commission.
   She estimated that before the arrests only about 40 percent of
the pregnant cocaine addicts who came to her office asked for
treatment. Now, she said, they all want treatment.
   ``A lot of them will tell you, `I don't want to go to prison,'''
she said.

<HEAD>No Sign of Harm to Wild Panthers from AIDS-Like Virus</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The discovery of an AIDS-like virus in Florida
panthers has scientists worried about its impact on the endangered
animals, but they say there is no indication the disease is fatal
to the beasts.
   Scientists have expressed surprise at finding the antibodies in
panthers living in the wilds of South Florida, whose numbers are
said to range from about 30 to 50.
   ``It's just another problem that we need to be aware of,'' Dr.
Melody Roelke, state panther recovery project veterinarian, said
Thursday.
   ``These panthers are having to deal with so many facets that are
potentially dangerous to them ... and yet somehow they're
surviving,'' Roelke said in a telephone interview from Gainesville.
   Feline immunodeficiency virus was first detected in domesticated
panthers two years ago. A Cornell University researcher testing
panther blood samples last year detected FIV antibodies in six of
20 tests.
   Technological advances in the identification of acquired immune
deficiency syndrome may partially explain an increase in positive
test results. A review of old blood samples using the new
technology shows the virus was present in panthers long before it
was discovered in humans in the early 1980s.
   ``I believe from the research they have been able to go back to
bank serum samples to 1960, ad they have found positive samples,''
said Roelke. ``It may have been there a lot longer than that.''
   The time span the virus has been present gives researchers some
relief that it does not spell doom for the panthers.
   ``I don't think we need to look at this as another impending
disaster. If it was going to be that way, it would've happened
already,'' said David Maehr, state wildlife biologist in charge of
panther research in South Florida.
   But the positive tests adds a concern to the captive breeding
program to be launched in March or April. Wild panthers will be
sent to four Florida zoos with the idea of boosting their
population under controlled conditions.
   Roelke said it will be important to test the panthers and make
sure none that test positive are placed in zoos with cat
populations free of FIV.

<HEAD>Nine Iranians To Be Deported From Britain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain announced it was deporting nine Iranians
for reasons of national security, but would give no details about
their identities or what they had done.
   Iranian television said one of the nine was the chief of its
London bureau.
   The Home Office said Thursday that the nine have until Feb. 9 to
be out of the country.
   ``They are being asked to leave on the grounds that it would be
conducive to the public good and for reasons of national
security,'' said a spokesman, who was not identified in keeping
with British custom.
   A spokesman for Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB)
said Ara, who has been bureau chief for nearly two years, was
notified Thursday by letter that he had to leave the country.
   In a statement, Ara said, ``I was surprised to receive the
notice. I think the decision has been made on the basis of
anti-cultural discrimination.''
   Ara and the TV spokesman said they did not know who the other
eight Iranians were, but an Iranian TV broadcast monitored by the
British Broadcasting Corp. said two were students.
   Britain deported two Iranians students in December. Their
attorney said Britain suspected the men of being a hit squad to
kill writer Salman Rushdie.
   The late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a religious edict
Feb. 14, 1989, calling on Moslems to kill Rushdie, the author of
``The Satanic Verses.'' Many Moslem leaders consider the book
blasphemous to Islam.
   The Home Office refused to comment on any possible connection
between the Rushdie affair and the nine Iranians.

<HEAD>Study: Positive Test for AIDS Virus Doesn't Increase Suicidal
Ideas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors need not be overly concerned about doing
AIDS-virus testing for fear that patients might commit suicide if
they learn they are infected, according to a study published today.
   With proper counseling, people who learn they are infected with
the AIDS virus are no more likely to think about killing themselves
than those who learn they are virus-free, the study in the Journal
of the American Medical Association reported.
   ``Given the improved early treatments for HIV-related illnesses,
neither physicians nor patients should avoid seeking the test for
fear they won't be able to deal with the results,'' said Dr. Samuel
Perry, professor of clinical psychiatry at Cornell University
Medical College in New York.
   ``It is not an imminent death sentence, as many people believe.''
   The study reported on 244 men and 57 women who completed written
tests to gauge depression at intervals two weeks before, and one
week and two months after notification of results of their
AIDS-virus tests, researchers said.
   ``The reassuring part is that if people at risk for infection
are given adequate pre- and post-test counseling, notifying them of
infection doesn't increase their risk of suicidal (ideas),'' Perry
said in a telephone interview Thursday. ``At least not if they are
asymptomatic and over a short time.''
   ``The less reassuring part is that people at risk seem to have a
high rate of depressive illness independent of whether they're
infected with the virus,'' he said.
   Previous studies have shown high rates of suicide among men who
have developed the disease.
   A study found the rate of suicide in 1985 among men ages 20 to
59 who had AIDS _ not just the infection, which may take years to
cause symptoms, but the actual disease _ was 36 times the rate of
men without AIDS.
   Another study, of 1986 California death certificates, found the
relative suicide rate of men ages 20 to 39 who had AIDS was 21
times that of men without AIDS, the researchers said.
   In the new study, among the 49 subjects who were found to be
infected, rates of thinking about suicide were 28.6 percent at
entry and 27.1 percent and 16.3 percent at the followups, the
researchers reported.
   Among the 252 subjects informed they were virus-free, suicidal
ideas decreased from 30.6 percent at entry to 17.1 percent and 15.9
percent at one week and two months after notification, the study
found.

   De Klerk also said he would lift bans on more than 30 other
opposition groups, free all prisoners jailed for belonging to these
groups, declare a moritorium on executions, and scrap most of the
restrictions imposed during more than three years of a state of

   These were among the steps demanded by Mandela and the ANC as

the black majority's exclusion from national politics. De Klerk's
announcements, reversing decades of his governing National Party's
policy, appeared to set the the stage for such talks to begin,
probably with the government accepting Mandela's offer to serve as

   The alternative to negotiation, de Klerk said, ``is growing
violence, tension and conflicts.''

<HEAD>Homeless Man Named to Committee on Homeless in Reno</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA MYERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RENO, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City Hall is becoming as familiar a place for
Walter Rhodes as the Salvation Army, missions and churches he
frequents by day and the shelters or bridges where he sleeps at
night.
   But Rhodes isn't camping out on government steps or sifting
through the trash outside the downtown building.
   After seeing him regularly at City Council meetings, Reno
leaders decided in January to appoint Rhodes to a city committee,
hoping he can help them resolve Reno's homeless problem.
   ``I guess, right now, I'm going to be the token homeless person
on the committee,'' said Rhodes, 54, who's been homeless three
times in his life. ``But I'm glad they're giving me the chance to
be heard. Even if they don't listen, I can say I tried.''
   The Greenbelt Preservation Committee was proposed by the Reno
Police Department, which showed council members photographs
depicting filthy homeless camps along the nearby Truckee River,
which officers want cleaned up.
   Rhodes initially saw the panel as another attempt to roust the
homeless, who number from 600 to 5,000 in Reno depending on who's
counting and who qualifies: some agencies count people temporarily
living in the city's cheap motels as homeless; others tally only
those living on the streets.
   ``As soon as I saw the police were proposing this committee then
I knew it was just something they cooked up to get us off the river
and out of sight,'' Rhodes says. ``I hope I'm proved wrong.''
   Rhodes, who claims an IQ of 167, is scheduled to be officially
appointed at the Feb. 13 council meeting, but already he's finding
political life difficult.
   ``As soon as it got around that I was going to be on the
committee, I got two death threats from two guys camped out by me
on the river,'' said Rhodes.
   Rhodes moved from his living quarters under a busy bridge
outside of Reno to a room above the Gospel Mission with the help of
a church friend who picked up the $30-a-week tab for two weeks
after the mid-January death threats. He escaped the darkness,
litter and human excrement polluting the riverbank.
   ``This is where we live,'' he said, crouching near a makeshift
campfire grill. ``It's cleaner than most, but even the best camps
are bad.''
   Born in Lisbon, a small Ohio town near Youngstown, Rhodes said
he graduated from high school, attended one year of business school
and took a correspondence course in religion.
   He was placed in a mental hospital twice in the late 1950s and
found himself homeless shortly after his release. He later found
work for a telephone directory sales company for nine years,
traveling through 37 states in the 1960s and early 1970s.
   He became homeless again from 1975 until 1977 after a long spell
of unemployment, and returned to the streets again last September
after he lost a telephone sales job. Unlike many of Reno's
transients, he said he doesn't drink alcohol or gamble.
   It's Rhodes' theory that about half of the homeless people in
America don't want to get off the streets and a third of those who
do want a home and job aren't capable of succeeding.
   ``The homeless problem will never go away because only about
one-third of all the people on the street will ever get off,'' he
says. ``I think it's up to the churches to help them, but when that
doesn't happen it's up to government.''
   Reno's City Council has agreed to spend as much as $2 million to
find a location for a new homeless center that would centralize
many services now spread throughout the city. Plans are in the
initial stages.
   Rhodes said the biggest mistake Reno and other cities make is
treating each street person the same instead of providing
individualized help.
   ``If someone wants to stay on the street, all he needs is
limited services like food, clothing, some shelter,'' Rhodes said.
``But the rest, they need help to find jobs.
   ``It's hard to get a job when you've been on the streets and
smell like 16 miles of road,'' added Rhodes, who wears a green
corduroy coat he doesn't remove, even indoors, during the winter.
   ``The worst thing to happen to homeless people is to be treated
like we aren't there or we're less than human.''

<HEAD>Teacher, Librarian Suspended Over Showing of `Catch-22'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBUQUERQUE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A teacher who showed the film ``Catch-22'' to
college-bound juniors has been suspended along with a school
librarian because the movie is rated R, officials said.
   La Cueva High School teacher Joyce Briscoe didn't know about the
movie's rating when she showed it, teachers union spokeswoman Mary
Lombardo said Thursday.
   Ms. Briscoe also had drawn the wrath of some parents in October
for screening ``The Last Temptation of Christ'' for students who
had parental permission.
   School board member Leonard DeLayo Jr. said he was disgusted by
the suspension and by two groups' use of the ``Last Temptation''
issue in an effort to defeat a mill-levy for schools in next
Tuesday's election.
   ``I think the suspension was wrong, and I think it's wrong for
one group to hold an entire school district hostage because of
their beliefs,'' DeLayo said.
   Ron Frost, spokesman for one of the organizations, Albuquerque
American Family Coalition, said the group had nothing to do with
the suspensions but was pleased by the action. He called for Ms.
Briscoe to be fired.
   Parents upset by the ``Last Temptation'' screening launched a
campaign last month against the levy and any other proposed tax
increases for schools.
   ``Last Temptation'' is considered offensive by some religious
groups. The furor over the screening forced the Albuquerque Public
Schools to revise its movie policy.
   New guidelines released last month require a school committee to
review films rated PG-13 or R before they are shown. The principal
would make a final decision.
   Ms. Lombardo said ``Catch-22'' was not stored with other R-rated
films in the library. School spokeswoman Crystal McClernon said
librarian Pauline Jones has been suspended with pay for checking
the movie out for Ms. Briscoe.
   Superintendent Jack Bobroff said he decided to suspend the two
with pay ``until the matter is investigated and resolved.''
   A R-rated film at a movie theater requires children under age 17
to be accompanied by a parent or adult guardian.
   Ms. Lombardo said the union plans to file a grievance for Ms.
Briscoe, asking that she be immediately reinstated.
   ``Catch-22,'' based on Joseph Heller's novel of the same name,
portrays life in a U.S. bomber squadron during World War II.
   The 1970 film was directed by Mike Nichols and starred Alan
Arkin, Jon Voight, Orson Welles, Richard Benjamin, Art Garfunkel,
Anthony Perkins and Bob Newhart.

   President F.W. de Klerk announced
Friday that the African National Congress will be legalized after
30 years of guerrilla war against white rule, but that its leader
Nelson Mandela will not be freed from jail immediately.
   In a speech opening Parliament, De Klerk also said he would lift
bans on more than 30 other opposition groups, free all prisoners
jailed for belonging to these groups, declare a moratorium on
executions, and scrap most of the restrictions imposed during more
than three years of a state of emergency.
   These were among the steps demanded by Mandela and the ANC as
preconditions for negotiations on a new constitution that would end
the black majority's exclusion from national politics.
   De Klerk's announcements, reversing decades of his governing
National Party's policy, appeared to set the stage for such talks
to begin _ probably with the government accepting Mandela's offer
to serve as mediator.
   The alternative to negotiation, de Klerk said, ``is growing
violence, tension and conflicts.''
   Although he decined to set an exact date for Mandela's release,
the president said: ``I want to put it plainly that the government
has decided to release Nelson Mandela unconditionally.''
   ``The government will take a decision soon on the date of his
release,'' he said, speaking in Afrikaans. ``Unfortunately, a
further short passage of time is unavoidable.''
   He did not elaborate.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater has said President Bush
will invite Mandela to Washington as soon as he is released.
   South, an anti-apartheid newspaper in Cape Town, reported
Mandela recently gave a letter to the government saying that
``conflict and violence in South Africa would never be settled
unless the government and the African National Congress reached
agreement.''
   ``The climate (for negotiations) would be created if apartheid
legislation was scrapped, the state of emergency lifted, banned
organizations unbanned, political prisoners released, exiles
allowed to return and all executions and political trials halted,''
South quoted Mandela as saying.
   The magazaine said Mandela personally handed the document to
Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee.
   De Klerk and Mandela first met Dec. 13. Since then, both the
government and the ANC have given increasingly serious
consideration to the possibility of negotiations.
   De Klerk, who took office in August, had eased restrictions on
anti-government protests and offered to negotiate a new
constitution that would include a political role for blacks. But he
says he is not prepared to accept the ANC's demand for a
one-person, one-vote system that would lead to black majority rule.
   Mandela, 71, has spent more than 27 years in prison for his role
in planning the start of the ANC's guerrilla campaign. His release
is seen as necessary before black leaders will enter negotiations.

<HEAD>Oil Workers Accept Three-Year Amoco Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The oil workers union reached a tentative
agreement with Amoco Corp. that is expected to pave the way for
negotiations with the oil industry nationwide.
   The offer was presented to union representatives Thursday at
various Amoco refineries. The Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers
International Union represents about 40,000 workers, including
about 4,500 employed by Amoco.
   Strikes at individual oil companies had been a possibility since
midnight Wednesday, with the expiration of some 300 contracts
between oil companies and the union.
   Union leaders never planned a nationwide walkout, but said they
might strike individual companies.
   Amoco spokesman Mike Thompson confirmed from Chicago that a
tentative agreement for a new three-year labor contract has been
reached at at least two Amoco refineries in Casper, Wyoming, and
Yorktown, Virginia.
   Union Vice President Robert Wages said he expects the Amoco
offer providing a general wage increase of $2.36 per hour over
three years to set a pattern for the current round of negotiations
with the oil industry.
   The contract calls for an immediate 80-cent-per-hour wage
increase, a 5.3 percent hike based on the refinery worker's current
average pay of $15.18 per hour.
   Amoco agreed to increase its contribution to health care
premiums by $55 per month for family coverage in the first year.
The company will add an additional $45 a month in the second year
of the agreement and another $50 in the third year.
   A $250,000 death benefit for workers killed in work-related
accidents also was negotiated into the contract.
   Amoco agreed to provide up to 26 weeks at full pay for workers
absent due to occupational illness or injury, and an additional 26
weeks at half pay.
   But Wages said in a news release that Amoco failed to address
environmental issues brought up by union representatives.
   ``We are extremely disappointed at the industry's failure to
address our proposal on environmental monitoring,'' Wages said.
``It would have been in their own best interest to take that step.
It would have benefited them tremendously.''

   The government says it will not charge two
former ranking officials and three other Mexicans who were indicted
in Los Angeles this week in the torture-slaying of U.S. drug agent
Enrique Camarena Salazar.
   ``We are not going to file any complaints at this time,'' a
spokeswoman for the Attorney General's office said in an interview
Thursday. ``They were members of the past administration.''
   Manuel Ibarra Herrera, former chief of Federal Judicial Police,
and Miguel Aldana Ibarra, who headed the Mexican branch of the
international policy agency Interpol, live in Mexico City and
served in the administration of former President Miguel de la
Madrid, who left office 13 months ago.
   They were indicted Wednesday by a federal grand jury in Los
Angeles that is continuing a five-year investigation into the
deaths of Camarena, a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent,
and his Mexican pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar.
   Camarena and Zavala were killed after Camarena led raids on
marijuana plantations allegedly run by Guadalajara drug kingpin
Rafael Caro Quintero.
   Camarena's body was found March 5, 1985, on a ranch 65 miles
southeast of Guadalajara. The DEA pledged it will prosecute all
connected to the case.
   A Mexican judge in December sentenced Caro Quintero to 40 years
in prison for his role in the Camarena slaying. He is one of a
dozen people convicted in the case in Mexico.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman said authorities have no
information about any U.S. plans to request extradition of the five.
   The Los Angeles indictment also named reputed drug lord Miguel
Angel Felix Gallardo, who has been in jail in Mexico on narcotics
charges since April. The whereabouts of the two others, Humberto
Alvarez Machain and Antonio Vasquez Ochoa, are unknown.
   Vasquez is charged with violent crime in aid of racketeering in
the Guadalajara slayings of U.S. citizens John Walker and Alberto
Radelat in January 1985.
   The indictment also named a Honduran, Juan Ramon Matta
Ballesteros, who was extradited from his homeland in 1988 and
sentenced to a life term in prison by a Los Angeles federal judge
after being convicted of masterminding a California drug ring
linked to Colombian traffickers.
   Neither Aldana or Ibarra could be reached at their Mexico City
telephone numbers on Thursday.
   But Aldana, 44, was quoted by the independent Excelsior news
service in Mexico as saying he is considering ``a countersuit
through Foreign Ministry channels.''
   Aldana resigned from his Interpol post on Jan. 2, 1986, after 28
years as a law enforcement officer. He said he wanted to write
books and do criminology research.
   He resigned after the weekly newsmagazine Proceso said a drug
defendant had testified that a shipment of Colombian cocaine seized
at the Mexico City airport was for Aldana. The defendant later
recanted, claiming his testimony was made under duress.
   Aldana alleged in recent interviews that Camarena was corrupt.
   He told Excelsior his only involvement with the Camarena murder
were ``investigations ordered by the Attorney General's office in
1985.''
   The former Interpol chief in Mexico now is a top member of a
lawyers associations in Mexico City and runs a private consulting
business.
   Ibarra, 58, dropped out of public life in 1988 when he retired
from the judicial police, Mexico's equivalent of the FBI.
   Newsweek said in a 1985 report that when Ibarra led the force,
the DEA gave him a tip that Matta Ballesteros was in a Mexico City
hotel. But the magazine said that it took Ibarra's men 36 hours to
reach the hotel and by the time they arrived, Matta Ballesteros had
fled, .
   The Attorney General's Office told Excelsior that both Aldana
and Ibarra have been called before federal magistrates since
retiring, but only to testify as investigators.

<HEAD>CDC: Better Education Needed to Prevent Sexually Transmitted
Diseases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Syphilis has soared to its highest rate in 40
years and young people's education about sexually transmitted
diseases is lacking, federal health researchers say.
   The national Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday that
just two of five major 1990 goals for the prevention of sexually
transmitted diseases are on track.
   The federal government's goals, set in 1979, were aimed at
reducing gonorrhea and syphilis while raising awareness among
doctors and young people.
   Gonorrhea rates dropped as hoped during the 1980s, the CDC said,
but syphilis is soaring and education efforts are falling behind.
   ``There's good news and bad news,'' said Dr. Ward Cates, the
CDC's director of sexually transmitted disease prevention. ``We've
made major inroads in controlling gonorrhea, but we've seen much
less success on syphilis and other sexually transmitted
infections.''
   The major sexually transmitted diseases, for the most part, are
preventable or curable, Cates said.
   ``We have seen over the last half century that if adequate
resources are targeted to each of these conditions, it can lead to
sustained efforts and controlling them,'' he said.
   The five goals for 1990 and the progress, or lack of it:
   _Reduce the syphilis rate to seven cases per 100,000 Americans
per year, and congenital syphilis _ syphilis at birth _ to 1.5
cases per 100,000 infants under 1.
   Status: Not likely. Syphilis in 1988 was at its highest rate in
40 years, 16.2 cases per 100,000, with about 39,000 cases reported.
Congenital syphilis also has soared, to a rate of 17.7 in '88 (672
cases).
   _Reduce the gonorrhea rate to 280 per 100,000 Americans.
   Status: Likely. The rate had fallen by 1988 to 303, down from
more than 450 in 1975.
   _Reduce the rate of pelvic inflammatory disease to 560 cases per
100,000 women.
   Status: Likely. The rate dropped from nearly 900 in '81 to 610
by '88.
   _Ninety-five percent of health-care providers treating sexually
transmitted diseases should be able to diagnose and appropriately
treat all recognized forms of such ailments.
   Status: Not likely. A 1985 survey found that nearly two-thirds
of physicians wouldn't implement traditional spouse notification in
a typical gonorrhea case, and 90 percent didn't assess their
patients' sexual practices.
   _Give every junior and senior high school student accurate,
timely education about sexually transmitted diseases.
   Status: Not likely. Just three out of four teen-agers surveyed
in '88 reported education on the illnesses before age 18.
   The Atlanta-based CDC said the war on sexually transmitted
diseases was made more difficult in the 1980s by increases in
ailments such as chancroid and herpes, by the practice of trading
sex for crack cocaine, and by the advent of AIDS.

   Workers began removing the wreckage of a
crashed Colombian jetliner and federal investigators prepared a
trip to Bogota to study records that might cast light on the crash.
   The records National Transportation Safety Board investigators
will view include maintenance logs and information about the crew's
employment records and personal habits before the Jan. 25 plane
crash that killed 73 people.
   As workers with chainsaws Thursday sliced through the wings of
the Boeing 707 that was Avianca Flight 52, resident Samuel
Tissenbaum said the wreckage had been a horrible reminder of the
tragedy.
   ``This has been a terrible experience. We're anxious for them to
get rid of this plane,'' said Tissenbaum, whose house barely was
missed by the crashing aircraft. Its nose remains stuck in the deck
of his home.
   Avianca hired Charlotte Aircraft Corp. of Charlotte, N.C., to
remove the wreckage, and a half-dozen workers worked Thursday on
its wings.
   NTSB officials wrapped up their on-site investigation Wednesday.
In addition to the deaths, 85 were injured when the plane, heading
to John F. Kennedy International Airport from Colombia, slammed
into a hillside after apparently running out of gas above this
secluded Long Island town.
   Before workers began cutting the plane's wings into
5-foot-square pieces for removal, the scene appeared frozen in time
since the night of the crash with hunks of twisted metal, seats and
other debris scattered on the hillside next to Tissenbaum's house.
   Once the pieces of wing were cut, they were loaded onto a truck
and hauled away.
   The cleanup could take up to three weeks because the site can
only be reached by a single winding road, said police Sgt. John
Woodworth.
   Nassau County police were also at the scene collecting luggage,
property and other personal effects that were not initially picked
up. Workers from New York Telephone and the Long Island Lighting
Co. were there, too, moving wires and cutting down trees.

   Whooping cough strikes as many as 60,000
Americans a year, federal researchers say, adding that most victims
are preschoolers and too many are unvaccinated.
   The national Centers for Disease Control said Thursday that
3,450 cases of whooping cough, or pertussis, were reported in 1988,
2,823 in 1987 and 4,195 in 1986. CDC's unofficial 1989 count is
3,745 cases.
   But the CDC said the reported cases are perhaps only 5 percent
or 10 percent of the nation's total pertussis cases.
   Of 10,468 reported cases from 1986-88, 4,394, or 42 percent,
occurred in children under 1. Another 2,602, or 25 percent,
occurred in children between 1 and 4.
   Twenty-six of 8,682 patients studied between 1986 and 1988 died,
and 14 of them were younger than 6 months old, the CDC said.
   The CDC's Immunization Practices Advisory Committee recommends
pertussis vaccinations _ usually given in
diptheria-pertussis-tetanus shots _ at or before 3 months, 5
months, 7 months and 19 months.
   Out of a group of 3,793 pertussis patients between 3 months and
4 years old, the CDC said, a survey found that 63 percent had not
had the appropriate number of shots, and 34 percent had never
received a shot at all.
   Pertussis, which causes its characteristic cough among other
symptoms, is treatable with drugs in most cases, most often
erythromycin.

   A former Marine and Air Force
communications officer will face a substantially reduced sentence
in exchange for pleading guilty to passing secret information to
the Soviet Union.
   Frank Nesbitt changed his verdict to guilty Thursday, five days
before his trial on espionage charges was due to begin in federal
court. If convicted on the original charges, he could have faced
life imprisonment. The plea bargain arrangement means he could get
a maximum jail term of 10 years.
   ``Did you do it?'' U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis asked Nesbitt,
45.
   ``Yes, sir,'' Nesbitt said calmly.
   According to earlier testimony by the government, Nesbitt came
to the FBI last October to tell them of an odyssey that led him
through Central and South America and on to the Soviet Union and
back. His attorney claimed Nesbitt simply wanted ``some excitement
in his life.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Hulkower said Nesbitt passed
information to the Soviets later determined by the National
Security Agency to be classified, but the nature of the material
was not disclosed publicly. Nesbitt was indicted in November on
espionage charges.
   Nesbitt testified Thursday he did not realize that the material
was classified.
   ``It was my true and honest effort not to do that,'' he told the
judge.
   The judge set sentencing for March 16. The agreement does not
entitle Nesbitt to parole. He also could be fined up to $250,000.
FBI Special Agent Lizzie Cassell testified in October that Nesbitt
left his wife and two children in Millington, Tenn., last June,
leaving a note saying: ``Don't look for me. I'm gone.''
   Nesbitt said Thursday he decided to go to the Soviet Union after
contacting Soviet officials while traveling in Bolivia last year.
He said he was later kept in a safe house for a few days until he
failed a lie detector test and the Soviets then broke off the
contacts.
   He said he had agreed to cooperate with the Soviets after they
showed him a picture of his two children taken outside his
Tennessee home.
   Nesbitt said two Soviet agents followed him when he returned to
the United States and he went to the FBI. Ms. Cassell said that a
few days after telling the FBI his story, Nesbitt was arrested at a
Virginia hotel when ``agents were forced to break the door down.''
   Nesbitt served from 1963 to 1966 in the Air Force's Electronic
Security Command in West Germany and from 1969 to 1979 in the
Marine Corps, where he dealt with classified communication
gathering. He also worked in the Los Alamos National Laboratories
from 1983 to 1984. He had a top secret code word clearance in all
his jobs.
   His attorney, David Hopkins, said Nesbitt pleaded guilty because
of ``a recognition of the strength of the government's case. This
is 10 years, the other is life. It's enough to give anyone pause.''

<HEAD>California Officials Consider Changing Time of Executions</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with date set for judge to schedule
execution, details on Harris' status; no pickup</NOTE>
<DATELINE>SAN QUENTIN, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   San Quentin Prison officials are
considering changing the time for executions to midnight from the
traditional 10 a.m. to avoid traffic problems on the highway
outside the prison.
   A San Diego court will set a date Monday for the execution of
Robert Alton Harris, convicted of killing two teen-agers, who would
be the first person to die in the California gas chamber since 1967.
   ``A lot has happened out there in the last 23 years,'' said
Vernell Crittenden, administrative assistant to the warden. ``It's
not just one motorist coming down the road anymore.
   ``You're going to have people rubbernecking when this happens.
There will be hundreds of people around the prison. People driving
by. The media. Illegally parked cars.''
   Considerations of a time-change developed after the Oct. 17
earthquake, when freeway gridlock and damage to the San
Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge routed hundreds of thousands of
motorists north to the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge, and right past
San Quentin.
   Prison spokesman Cal White said that since no one at the prison
has any experience with an execution, a team is being trained.
   The U.S. Supreme Court on Jan. 16 rejected Harris' latest appeal.
   Superior Court Judge Jesus Rodriguez in San Diego said Thursday
he had denied a defense request to postpone Monday's scheduled
issuance of a death warrant. The execution could occur from 30 to
60 days after the warrant is signed.
   Defense attorneys Michael McCabe and Charles Sevilla contended
in their motion that setting an execution date while Harris' final
appeal is pending before the California Supreme Court would be ``a
waste of judicial resources, attorney time and public money.''
   The state Supreme Court has requested written arguments to be
submitted by March 16 on 10 issues raised by the defense.
   Harris' case procedurally is further along the legal appeals
process than that of any of the 271 other inmates on San Quentin's
Death Row.

   A judge dismissed a child-abuse complaint
brought against a pregnant woman because she drank alcohol, saying
the state did not produce probable cause that her fetus had been
injured.
   ``The key as I see it is that the child already has to have
suffered,'' Judge Robert Denhardt said.
   Diane Pfannenstiel, 29, was about four months pregnant when she
was arrested Jan. 4, two months after another judge ordered her to
remain alcohol-free.
   A blood test revealed she had a blood alcohol level of 0.1
percent, the level at which a person is considered intoxicated
under state law.
   Pfannenstiel quickly left the court after Denhardt's decision
without commenting.
   Her lawyer, Mary Elizabeth Galvan, said the judge's decision
Thursday adhered to the letter of the law, which states an injury
must exist for abuse to occur.
   ``If you want the child abuse statutes to cover fetuses, then
you go to the Legislature and you ask them to enact that statute,''
Galvan said.
   Dr. Gary Lang, a pediatrician, testified that studies have shown
pregnant women who drink excessively are prone to give birth to
children suffering from fetal alcohol syndrome, which is exhibited
by physical and mental developmental defects. But Lang could not
say definitely that the defendant's fetus had been injured by its
mother's drinking.
   He said it could take years to determine if the drinking had
injured the fetus.
   Denhardt declined at the beginning of a preliminary hearing to
dismiss the case. He made his ruling after hearing testimony.
   The defense never presented witnesses, winning the dismissal
after the state closed its case.

<HEAD>Kaifu Defends Governing Party in Televised Debate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE KURTENBACH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu today defended his
conservative party's 34 years in power against attacks from four
opposition leaders in Japan's first televised campaign debate since
1960.
   The governing Liberal Democrats face the first serious challenge
in decades to their majority in the 512-seat lower house. Elections
are set for Feb. 18.
   Party leaders agreed to the debate after opposition parties and
the news media criticized Kaifu for dissolving the lower house of
parliament on Jan. 24 in preparation for elections without giving a
traditional pre-election policy speech.
   ``Four versus one _ it's not fair,'' Kaifu said, drawing laughs
after he tried to comment out of order during the three-hour debate.
   The debate dealt at length with the question of whether leftist
opposition parties would preserve democratic liberties if they win
a majority.
   ``This election is a choice between liberalism and socialism,
and we've already seen on a global scale that liberalism has won,''
said Kaifu, voicing the key campaign strategy of his party.
   Takako Doi of the Japan Socialist Party and Japan Communist
Party Chairman Tetsuzo Fuwa sharply rebutted that theme.
   Ms. Doi accused Kaifu of ``spreading ink like an escaping
squid'' to obscure the real issues of the election. ``Under the
current constitution, liberty and democracy is already
guaranteed,'' she said.
   Sitting side by side, Kaifu, 59, and Ms. Doi, 61, dominated the
debate at the Japan National Press Club.
   It was the first televised confrontation between a Liberal
Democratic prime minister and top leaders of the opposition since
Nov. 12, 1960, when Liberal Democratic Prime Minister Hayato Ikeda
took on the leaders of the Socialist and Democratic Socialist
parties.
   Ms. Doi drew indignant looks from Kaifu when she accused the
Liberal Democrats of deceiving the public.
   ``People feel they can't trust the government because of
repeated incidents and the lies they have heard,'' the Socialist
leader said, alluding to a series of scandals and an unpopular
sales tax enacted after the Liberal Democrats had promised to avoid
such a levy.
   ``It's the way it was done that's the problem,'' Ms. Doi said.
``We want to return the country to a true `people's government.'''
   Polls show the Liberal Democrats could lose their majority in
the powerful lower house, partly because of dislike of the
3-percent sales tax and partly due to the party's rocky record in
the past year.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita resigned in April amid a
stock-profiteering scandal. His successor, Sousuke Uno, lasted only
two months after allegations surfaced that he kept paid mistresses.
The Liberal Democrats lost their majority in the upper house of
Parliament in July.
   After opening statements, Kaifu, Ms. Doi, Fuwa and the leaders
of the centrist Komeito (Clean Government Party) and Democratic
Socialist Party responded to pre-arranged questions on foreign
policy, political reform, the sales tax and other issues.
   The highly formalized debate drew a lukewarm reaction from
political analysts.
   ``Neither side ... was able to present a clear vision'' on how
to handle pressure from foreign governments to open Japanese
markets, said Josen Takahashi, at Mitsubishi Research Institute, a
private think tank.

   The judge in the trial of former Exxon
Valdez captain Joseph Hazelwood rejected defense efforts to exclude
as evidence the results of two sobriety tests.
   Thursday was the third day of jury selection in the trial of
Hazelwood, skipper of the super tanker when it wrecked and spilled
nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil into Prince William Sound in
March.
   Jury selection was scheduled to continue today for the trial,
which could last six weeks.
   Anchorage Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone rejected a defense
argument that blood-alcohol results should be banned as evidence
because they were obtained more than four hours after the accident.
He also denied an effort to have the results blocked on grounds
they were not presented to a grand jury as evidence of recklessness.
   Hazelwood faces a felony charge of criminal mischief and
misdemeanor charges of reckless endangerment, operating a vessel
while intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil. The maximum
penalty for conviction on all counts is seven years, three months
in prison and $61,000 in fines.
   Johnstone said he would study defense attorneys' requests for
information they say the Coast Guard is unwilling to turn over.
   The defense requested blood and urine tests administered to
Hazelwood and members of the Exxon Valdez crew after the tanker
struck a reef. The attorneys said the state should be restricted in
the information it can use against Hazelwood if they do not have
access to such material.
   Johnstone instructed attorneys for the Coast Guard and the state
to compile a list of information that the Coast Guard provided to
state prosecutors. He intends to consider that list in weighing
what the defense claims is material the Coast Guard denied it but
gave the state.
   Federal attorney R. Michael Underhill said the Coast Guard has
been fair in its release of information, but said the government is
unwilling to concede its right of federal sovereignty and privilege
in handling requests for material in the state court.

<HEAD>Pope Saw Two Sides of Africa During Trip</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II saw two starkly different sides of
Africa during his sixth trip to the continent, from a thatched hut
in Guinea-Bissau to a palace in Chad.
   Although he delivered 35 speeches in five countries of the Sahel
region, two off-the-cuff remarks summed up the pope's look at
today's Africa.
   ``Even here freedom is compromised'' by poverty, John Paul
lamented after stopping along a dirt road in Cumura, Guinea-Bissau,
and wandering unannounced into a tiny hut with no furniture, water
or electricity.
   Days later, in Chad, the pope found himself in another world,
greeted by President Hissene Habre in his brand new palace,
complete with fountains.
   ``Good night, Mr. President,'' the pontiff said as he left.
``You have a magnificent palace.''
   The average annual per capita income in Chad is about $150.
   The pope returned to Rome Thursday night after an eight-day,
8,600-mile journey through Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Burkina
Faso and Chad.
   Throughout the voyage, John Paul coupled his expressions of
distress at the grinding poverty with warnings against materialism
and unchecked wealth.
   He avoided a potentially embarrassing situation by deciding, for
now at least, not to travel to the Ivory Coast to consecrate a huge
basilica in Yamoussoukro that resembles St. Peter's in Rome.
   Some foreign prelates protested such a grandiose display in poor
Africa, but President Felix Houphouet-Boigny says the church was
built with his own funds.
   ``The pope has been invited by the president and the local
church hierarchy (to consecrate the basilica) and now it's up to
him whether to go on another trip,'' Vatican spokesman Joaquin
Navarro said. ``Many different elements have to be taken into
account.''
   To offset any negative image, the Vatican hopes that a special
institute for social development will be opened on the basilica
grounds, he said.
   While the pope's trip was intended to give hope to millions of
impoverished Africans, his message was just as often directed to
leaders in Europe and North America: Don't forget Africa and the
Third World.
   ``The great changes under way in Eastern Europe should not
divert attention from the South, especially the African
continent,'' he said in a speech to diplomats in Chad on Thursday.
   With the thaw in East-West relations, the Polish-born pope is
especially determined to draw the world's attention to the
persistent hardships in developing nations and the need for
North-South cooperation, Navarro said.
   John Paul pleaded for solidarity with Africa during a ceremony
in Ougadougou, Burkina Faso, marking the 10th anniversary of his
first appeal on behalf of the Sahel.
   ``God has allowed me to renew the appeal,'' Navarro quoted him
as telling local bishops later. ``If I hadn't done so, I wouldn't
be able to die in peace.''
   As the pope left Africa, planning was already under way for his
seventh tour of the continent in September. He is scheduled to
travel to Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi.
   Until then, he offered the African faithful a simple prayer:
   ``I ask God,'' the pope said before departing Chad, ``to give
all the people of Africa the strength of hope.''

   After 30 years of exile and
mostly futile guerrilla warfare, the African National Congress will
return to South Africa for political battles in which it is the
overwhelming favorite.
   The ANC, which has exile headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia, was
legalized today by President F.W. de Klerk in a move that instantly
changed the country's political scene.
   The most powerful black group opposing the white-led government
and its apartheid policies, the ANC has an estimated 15,000 members
in exile and millions of black supporters in South Africa. Most
observers believe it would win elections if the 28-million black
majority were allowed to vote. Virtually all leading anti-apartheid
groups in South Africa support the ANC.
   Its leadership is made up mostly of older, well-educated men
such as the imprisoned Nelson Mandela, 71, and Oliver Tambo, the
ANC's 71-year-old president, who is recovering in Sweden from a
stroke.
   De Klerk said today that Mandela, the country's best-known black
leader, will be freed shortly after more than 27 years in prison.
He is serving a life sentence for launching the ANC's guerrilla
campaign.
   Despite its aging leadership, the ANC's support is strongest
among South Africa's black youths, many of whom who received their
political education in repeated street clashes with the security
forces.
   Most of the ANC's young backers are ardent supporters of the
armed struggle. Until today, the organization had said its
guerrilla campaign remained an important part of struggle to obtain
black political rights, but de Klerk's announcements may prompt it
to suspend violence.
   The armed struggle has slackened considerably in the past two
years and poses no serious threat to the South African government.
   ``Looking at our situation realistically, we must admit that we
do not have the capacity within our country to intensify the
(armed) struggle in any meaningful way,'' ANC secretary-general
Alfred Nzo said last month.
   Even prior to de Klerk's speech today at the opening of
Parliament, the ANC appeared to be thrown off balance by the
president's reforms. Its emphasis on the armed struggle and
building support for sanctions against South Africa were generating
little enthusiasm. Now, such policies are even less likely to win
support.
   The ANC says it wants a one-person, one-vote democracy in South
Africa, a system de Klerk opposes, saying it will lead to black
domination of the 5 million whites.
   The ANC also says it envisions a mixed economy in South Africa,
though it has a strong ideological preference for socialism.
   The ANC, founded in 1912, peacefully opposed the South African
government until it was banned in 1960. A year later, Mandela
launched its guerrilla campaign and most of the leadership was
either arrested or went into exile.
   Seven senior leaders, including 77-year-old Walter Sisulu, were
released last October and have been campaigning openly on behalf of
the ANC.
   They continue to support the ANC's alliance with the South
African Communist Party, another banned group that de Klerk
legalized today. The membership of the two organizations overlap,
and about half of the ANC's top 35 leaders are believed to be
members of the Communist Party.
   De Klerk also legalized the Pan Africanist Congress, a smaller
black group that wages a sporadic guerrilla campaign. The Pan
Africanist Congress split from the ANC in 1959 over the question of
white participation in the black political struggle.
   The ANC has some white members and believes in a multiracial
quest for black political rights, while the Pan Africanist Congress
believes blacks should be completely self-reliant.

   Here is a brief chronology of
South Africa's recent political history.
   
   1912 _ The South African Native National Congress, forerunner of
the African National Congress, is formed to fight for black
political rights.
   1948 _ The National Party government is elected and begins
codifying apartheid legislation.
   1955 _ A national People's Congress is broken up and 156 black
leaders, including Nelson Mandela, are charged with treason. All
are acquitted after a trial that lasts until 1961.
   March 21, 1960 _ The ANC and the Pan Africanist Congress call
for peaceful protests against laws requiring blacks to have passses
to enter white areas. Police shoot and kill 69 blacks at a rally in
the Sharpeville township south of Johannesburg.
   April 1960 _ Parliament outlaws the ANC and the PAC. Both
organizations launch guerrilla campaigns a year later.
   Aug. 5, 1962 _ Nelson Mandela is arrested and two years later is
sentenced to life in prison for sabotage and plotting to overthrow
the government.
   June 16, 1976 _ Thousands of black students demonstrate in the
Soweto township outside Johannesburg, protesting a requirement that
lessons be taught in the Afrikaans language. Police fatally shoot
several students, touching off nationwide riots and boycotts that
last more than a year and claim at least 575 black lives.
   Sept. 12, 1977 _ Steve Biko, founder of the Black Consciousness
movement, dies in police detention.
   Oct. 19, 1977 _ The government bans 18 organizations and the two
largest black newspapers. It also detains 47 black leaders.
   Aug. 20, 1983 _ The United Democratic Front is launched to
organize opposition to a planned three-house Parliament that still
excludes blacks. The Front quickly becomes the largest legal
anti-apartheid group.
   September 1983 _ Riots break out in Sharpeville, touching off
three years of widespread violence claiming at least 2,500 black
lives.
   June 12, 1986 _ President P.W. Botha declares a nationwide state
of emergency, giving authorities broad powers to crack down on
opposition groups. More than 1,000 activists are detained predawn
raids. More than 30,000 people, almost all black, have been held

<HEAD>Union Leader: Workers Unhappy with New Wage Rate</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MATAMOROS, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A labor leader says workers at assembly
plants in this border city are unhappy with a new one-year contract
and wage agreement that ended a strike threat.
   Union and management officials at the mostly American-owned
plants said Thursday the new accord brought average wage and
benefits to roughly $2.30 an hour, a raise of about 15 percent.
   Union leaders demanding a 25 percent pay raise had threatened
several times to strike after the contracts ran out at 53 of the
city's approximately 80 maquiladora plants, in which mostly
foreign-made components are assembled for export to their country
of origin.
   A walkout could have idled as many as 60,000 workers at the
plants and in related industries in this town across the border
from Brownsville, Texas.
   Agapito Gonzalez Cavazos, who has led the Confederation of
Mexican Workers in Matamoros for the past 40 years, said
rank-and-file were disappointed in the compromise, which was
reached in Mexico City without his participation. But he said the
union would accept the accord.
   ``There is a restlessness among the workers, a malaise among the
workers,'' Gonzalez said Thursday after learning of the accord. ``A
worker who is not in agreement will become less productive.
   ``Fifteen percent to us means nothing because the cost of living
in Matamoros is high, the most expensive place to live in Mexico,''
he said.

today.
   The liaison office of the Israeli Academy of Science and
Humanities will be non-official, saod the source, who spoke on

   ``We think ... academic cooperation is a good start,'' the

   China and Israel do not have formal relations. Beijing has said
it will not normalize ties until Israel returns land seized from
Arab countries in 1967.
   China has good relations with Arab nations and the Palestine

Israel have met on several occasions, and China recently opened a
travel office in Israel. There also have been published reports of
Israeli arms sales to China.
   The source said the new office will concentrate on agricultural

<HEAD>Feds Charge 3 in Conspiracy to Sell Military Planes to Iran</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERA HALLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Americans and an Israeli have been charged
in a federal indictment with conspiring to arrange the sale to Iran
of three Israeli-owned U.S.-made military cargo planes.
   The indictment filed Thursday in U.S. District Court stemmed
from an undercover investigation by the U.S. Customs Service. The
sale, in which Iran was to buy the aircraft for $12 million each,
never went through.
   The men, allegedly middlemen in the deal, were charged with
conspiring to cover up the true destination of the C-130E
transports by submitting to the State Department false papers that
said a Brazilian company would buy them.
   Prosecutors said the proposed sale violated the Arms Export
Control Act in which the State Department must approve all
transfers abroad of American-made military goods. It prohibits the
sale of such goods to countries such as Iran that have supported
acts of international terrorism.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Baruch Weiss said he could not say
whether Israel knew the planes were to be sold to Iran.
   The Brazilian company, which was not identified, allegedly was
to receive $500,000 for providing the false information to the
State Department, the indictment said.
   The defendants named in the indictment were Joseph O'Toole, 58,
of Claremont, Calif.; Richard St. Francis, 40, of Fairfield, Conn.;
and Ari Ben Menashe, an Israeli.
   All three were first arrested in April when the terms of the
deal were finalized with an undercover Customs agent. The case was
then presented to a grand jury, which returned the indictment,
charging each with one count of conspiracy.
   Menashe has been jailed without bail since his arrest. The
others are free on bond.
   Weiss said he could not give more information about the
defendants. St. Francis, however, was identified in court papers as
a vice president of the Connecticut office of Vienna, Va.-based
TransCapital Corp.
   If convicted of conspiracy, the men face up to five years in
jail and a $250,000 fine.

<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh wants an
independent counsel to determine if former Housing Secretary Samuel
R. Pierce Jr. and his aides broke the law by steering federal rent
subsidies to politically connected developers.
   Thornburgh, stressing that the special prosecutor law left him
no other choice, said an independent counsel is needed to determine
if Pierce and other former housing officials ``may have violated
federal criminal law'' in the way they chose developers to
participate in the moderate rehabilitation program between 1984 and
1988.
   The Department of Housing and Urban Development program provides
rent subsidies and lucrative tax breaks to developers who perform a
moderate amount of rehabilitation on low-income housing units.
   Thornburgh's formal application to a special court cited reports
of a ``widespread perception among developers'' and local officials
that ``funds were being disbursed in disproportionate amounts to
projects backed by prominent Republicans acting as consultants or
by former HUD officials.''
   But the attorney general said he ``found no reasonable grounds
to believe that further investigation is warranted'' of allegations
that Pierce lied during congressional testimony when questioned
last May about political favoritism in the awarding of HUD grants.
   Jack Kemp, who succeeded Pierce at HUD at the start of the Bush
administration, promised to cooperate with the investigation.
   ``This is a tragic situation for all involved,'' Kemp said in a
statement. ``However, the department will provide whatever
cooperation and assistance is required for full and fair
disposition of this matter.''
   Robert Plotkin, one of Pierce's lawyers, said, ``We continue to
believe that Mr. Pierce has not violated any federal laws and we
are confident that, at the conclusion of an independent counsel
investigation, that will be determined.''
   The attorney general, an outspoken critic of the special
prosecutor law, made it plain that his decision to seek court
appointment of an independent counsel was forced upon him by the
statute.
   Thornburgh said the Justice Department's preliminary inquiry
into the allegations, which began Dec. 4, was hindered by the
department's inability under the law to conduct grand jury
proceedings or grant immunity to witnesses.
   Despite a review of ``voluminous information'' compiled by the
HUD inspector general and the House subcommittee and interviews
with department officials, ``a determination that no further
investigation is warranted is virtually foreclosed,'' Thornburgh
said.
   Any decision to drop the matter ``is made especially difficult
by the breadth of the allegations and the fact that a number of
figures central to the alleged conspiracy, including Secretary
Pierce and his former executive assistant, Deborah Dean, have
declined to be interviewed,'' Thornburgh said.
   Thornburgh disclosed that Pierce provided written answers to
questions submitted to him by the Justice Department's public
integrity section.
   The special prosecutor law virtually assures that an independent
counsel will be appointed by a special three-judge panel of the
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The court's Special Division
customarily acts within weeks of receiving requests by the attorney
general.
   The independent counsel law was triggered Nov. 2 when 19
Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee formally asked
Thornburgh to consider appointing an independent counsel to
investigate allegations of political favoritism at HUD uncovered in
congressional hearings last year.
   The attorney general said the questions asked by the lawmakers
and Pierce's answers were too ambiguous to sustain any charge of
perjury.
   Pierce's statement to a House Government Operations subcommittee
that he did not have a ``hands on'' involvement in running the
moderate rehabilitation program is ``readily susceptible to
countless interpretations,'' Thornburgh said.
   Thornburgh said there was also no basis to investigate the other
allegation of perjury put forth by House Democrats. Pierce's
statement that he ``did not give Miss Dean permission to say that I
wanted certain programs'' is subject to several interpretations not
unfavorable to the former secretary, Thornburgh said.
   Ms. Dean's attorney, Joseph diGenova, declined to comment on the
development.
   She was one of three former aides to Pierce who invoked the
Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination and refused
to testify before the House subcommittee hearings.
   Pierce, after testifying last spring, declined to answer further
questions when called back last fall. He, too, invoked the Fifth
Amendment.
   Thornburgh's decision was hailed by Democrats who spearheaded
the original request for a Justice Department review of the case.
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., who chaired the subcommittee
hearings, said he welcomed the decision, saying ``an independent
counsel, is in the best position to fully investigate and resolve
questions of possible criminal wrongdoing.''

   Soviet military commanders and Azerbaijani
People's Front leaders met for their first direct peace talks,
bypassing local government and Communist Party officials, People's
Front leaders said today.
   In Riga, Latvia, other representatives of the Azerbaijani
People's Front planned to start face-to-face negotiations with
leaders of the Armenian People's Front, with Baltic officials
serving as mediators.
   In Baku, Tofik Gosymov, one of 14 directors of the Azerbaijani
People's Front, told reporters he had demanded the immediate
withdrawal of the soldiers who entered Baku on Jan. 20 after days
of violent ethnic unrest in which scores of Armenians were chased
from their homes and beaten by Azerbaijani mobs.
   At least 214 died and more than 500 were injured in clashes
between citizens and Soviet soldiers, according to the latest
figures reported today.
   The two neighboring southern republics have been engaged in a
decades-old territorial dispute, largely focusing on the Armenian
enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, which is located inside Azerbaijani
territory. Armenians are mostly Christian; the Azerbaijanis are
predominantly Shiite Moslem.
   The peace talks indicate the growing prominence of people's
fronts, the unofficial, grass-roots organizations that have sprung
up in the Soviet Union, especially in republics seeking greater
autonomy from Moscow.
   Thursday's one-hour talks, at the Azerbaijani Interior Ministry,
entirely bypassed the Azerbaijan Communist Party and the Caucasus
republic's government, which has been sharply criticized for
failing to control the violence. The negotiations were organized by
Lev Ponamarev, of the Russian People's Front.
   There will be no further talks unless the Kremlin agrees to
withdraw its 17,000 soldiers from Baku, Gosymov said.
   ``If the question of the removal of the soldiers is not solved,
we won't negotiate with them and we won't cooperate,'' he said.
   Gosymov said Lt. Gen. Vladimir S. Dubinyak, the military
commandant, promised to transmit the demand to Moscow.
   The People's Front also demanded release of members arrested by
the military and an explanation of what they said were military
assaults on the People's Front headquarters.
   Dubinyak, accompanied by his assistant for political affairs,
Maj. Gen. Anatoly I. Kirilyuk, and an official of the national
Interior Ministry, said those issues could only be decided in
Moscow, Gosymov reported.
   He also said the military expressed interest in leaving Baku for
its own reasons. Gosymov said the People's Front needed at least a
schedule for withdrawal of the soldiers to bring the situation in
Baku back to normal.
   With such a schedule, ``We can appeal to the people to go back
to work and they will, 100 percent,'' he said.
   Soviet officials say more than 80 percent of Baku's workforce is
back on the job, but the People's Front claims the figure is much
lower.
   The talks in Riga were organized by the people's fronts of the
three Baltic republics.
   Armenian and Azerbaijani delegations appeared willing to try to
iron out their problems at the negotiating table. But Baltic
mediators cautioned that it could take two to three months to
achieve concrete results.
   ``We believe the exchange of views which will take place here
will serve to create better understanding of the positions of both
sides, and to help normalize the situation and find a way to
resolve our problems,'' Armenian delegate Ashot Manucharian told
The Associated Press.
   Dainis Ivans, chairman of the Latvian People's Front, said the
Baltic people's fronts want to share their strategies for achieving
independence and democracy, which have won greater freedom from
Moscow in a peaceful way, while the Caucasus has been engulfed in
violence.
   Khikmet Khazhidzade said he and his fellow Azerbaijani
negotiator, Sabit Bagirov, had found a meeting with the Baltic
leaders very constructive.
   The Armenians and the Azerbaijanis agreed to discuss the
presence of Soviet troops, the refugee problem and other
humanitarian issues related to their conflict. But Khazhidzade
stressed that final resolution of the dispute without a decision on
the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh is impossible.
   Nagorno-Karabakh is not on the agenda, but the Baltic mediators
say they expect the thorny territorial issue to come up early in
the talks.

   A doctor apparently trying to revive his
wife who was suffering a fatal asthma attack collapsed and died of
a heart attack.
   Paramedics found Betty Wrenn, 66, dead and her husband, Frank
Wrenn, 67, slumped over her in cardiac arrest on the floor of their
home Thursday, said Parks Evans, deputy coroner of Greenville
County.
   Wrenn was pronounced dead at Greenville Memorial Hospital a
half-hour later, Evans said.
   He said Wrenn was apparently trying to administer
cardiopulmonary resuscitation to his wife when he collapsed.
   The two were childhood sweethearts.
   ``It was a wonderful way to go for them,'' said Mrs. Wrenn's
sister, Mary S. McConnell. ``But it's just terrible on the rest of
us.''
   An expert in emergency medicine, Wrenn had served on the staff
of the Greenville Hospital System since 1955 until his retirement
in July, and was an examiner for the American Board of Neurological
Surgeons.
   A past president of the American Association of Neurosurgeons,
Wrenn was internationally known in his field.

   At least four tornadoes were reported in
southeastern Texas and severe storms moved across a large area of
the state, triggering flash floods and tumbling mobile homes with
winds up to 85 mph.
   No injuries were reported in the storms, but a utility lineman
working to restore power in Austin died early today after grabbing
a power line as he slipped while on a pole, authorities said.
   One tornado ripped through the Meadowbrook Trailer Park in
Humble, outside Houston, Thursday night. It overturned eight
trailer but caused no injuries, said Nancy Bivens, a police
dispatcher.
   ``All at once the trailer started shaking and she said, `C'mon,
the car port's going,''' said Floyd Miller, who was inside his
trailer with his wife, Karen. ``And I thought, `How could it? It's
anchored.'''
   ``Then, I looked and the patio was gone,'' Mrs. Miller said.
   Weather watchers reported tornadoes in three other counties
north of Houston.
   About 18,000 homes were without power in north Houston late
Thursday, and strong winds and heavy rain delayed flights at
Houston Hobby Airport.
   The storm activity was triggered by the combination of an
upper-level storm system and the northward flow of moisture from
the Gulf of Mexico, the weather service said.
   Flash flooding and power failures were reported in Dallas as
heavy rainfall snarled rush hour traffic and closed numerous
streets.
   An estimated 6,300 utility customers lost power in Fort Worth.
Full power was expected to be restored today, said TU Electric
spokesman George Hedrick.
   In Austin, the storm tore into the University of Texas'
communications building and knocked out power to some areas.
   At Cotulla, about 70 miles southwest of San Antonio, winds of at
least 85 mph ripped away roofs and business awnings, said City
Secretary Glenda Janek.

<HEAD>President: Moynihan Proposal on Social Security Dead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush says he believes a Democratic
proposal to cut Social Security taxes is dead, and he rules out any
major tax revision despite charges that middle-income families pay
a greater share than do their rich neighbors.
   ``Well, in a world where you were starting over maybe we could
design a better tax system, but I don't want to open up the entire
tax system at this point,'' Bush said Thursday, in an interview
published in today's Wall Street Journal.
   Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan had proposed rolling back Social
Security taxes, charging that the surplus in the Social Security
trust fund was being used to mask the size of the federal budget
deficit.
   Asked about the proposal's chances, Bush said, ``I hope it's
dead, and I think it is. ... After talking to the guys that are
wrestling with the problem on the administration's behalf, none of
us has a feeling there's a great thrust behind it anymore.''
   Bush said there is no need to take extraordinary measures to
reduce the budget deficit, because ``it isn't that long before the
budget is in balance'' thanks to Gramm-Rudman reductions.
   On other matters, Bush reiterated his support of Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev. ``I do feel that after (the summit at) Malta I
had a better feel for him as an individual and what he's trying to
do. ... I think that he has done more in a short period of time for
glasnost and reform than anybody in this room would have ever
predicted.''
   Still, he said, progress on arms control does not depend on
Gorbachev's continuing to hold power. ``I don't think it depends on
one man. I think we've got a policy, a program, and I think that's
established,'' he said.

   Iran-Contra middleman Albert Hakim, placed on
two years' probation and fined $5,000, says he is being threatened
by intermediaries who never received payments in the uproar
following public exposure of the secret arms sales to Iran.
   The Iranian-born businessman said in court papers released
Thursday that he has been impoverished by the Iran-Contra affair.
He had to defend himself in civil suits stemming from the scandal
and hire criminal defense lawyers.
   He pleaded guilty Nov. 21 to helping supplement former White
House aide Oliver North's income by allowing business partner
Richard Secord to pay for a security system at North's home.
   Hakim told Congress in 1987 that he promised to pay
``baksheesh'' to Iranian intermediaries who helped open a new
channel of communication in 1986 in the Reagan administration's
efforts to free hostages held in Lebanon.
   ``These intermediaries include individuals both inside and
outside of Iran, a number of whom can only be described as
dangerous,'' Hakim's lawyers said in the court papers. ``Mr. Hakim
... has been threatened on a number of occasions if these
obligations are not met.'' officials who understood that money for
the payments would come from theU.S. proceeds of earlier arms sales
to Iran. The Iranians had been charged exorbitant prices in those
sales.
   He set up a $2 million reserve fund for the payments at the
Enterprise, the maze of offshore companies Hakim created to handle
money in the Iran-Contra affair.
   The Iran initiative was exposed before the payments could be
made and Hakim has been left ``holding the bag,'' his lawyers said
in the court filing. The $2 million reserve was part of $7.8
million frozen by the Swiss, at the request of the United States,
when the Iran-Contra affair erupted. Interest on the money has
raised the total to $9 million. Hakim has forsworn any claim to
$7.3 million of the money and he says he is unlikely to see any of
the remainder.
   ``It is to him personally that the Iranian intermediaries even
today are pressing Mr. Hakim for payment,'' Hakim's lawyers said.
   Hakim will be able to file a claim for the $1.7 million, but two
Swiss-based lawyers who work with him, Willard Zucker and Philippe
Neyroud, also are claiming part of the money.
   Hakim says whatever he recovers won't be enough to satisfy
``enormous debts'' arising from the affair, which he says he
participated in only after he was assured every aspect had been
authorized by then-President Reagan.
   North, Secord and former national security adviser John
Poindexter have ``been fortunate to belong to a community of
military officers and others who have been able to offer them
considerable assistance,'' Hakim's lawyers said in court papers.
But Hakim and his family ``have shouldered the burdens of this
affair essentially alone.''

<HEAD>Bulgaria's Communists Choose a New Reformist Leader</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROLAND PRINZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party today appointed a new
leader who has criticized hard-liners and indicated he would speed
the pace of democratic reforms sought by the nation's emerging
opposition movement.
   Alexander Lilov, taking power following a secret party session
that ousted top Old Guard leaders, has promised to overhaul his
party before multiparty elections, scheduled for May.
   Outgoing party boss Petar Mladenov will remain as state
president. Bowing to demands for reform, he had proposed that the
head of the Communist Party and the head of state be separated.
   The changes, announced by the party, were the latest since
Mladenov replaced Todor Zhivkov, the hard-line Communist leader
whose 35-year rule ended on Nov. 10, and promised elections and
other democratic reforms.
   During the secret party session, which ended early today, the
party also cut the size of its Politburo and Central Committee.
Those ousted included Premier Georgi Atanassov, a holdover from the
Zhivkov era.
   The Central Committee was renamed as the party's Supreme Council.
   Atanassov and his 22-member Cabinet resigned Thursday following
sharp criticism during the emergency party congress for failing to
solve mounting labor unrest in Bulgaria. The Cabinet will serve
until Saturday, when Parliament will meet to accept the
resignation, the state news agency BTA said.
   The resignation was necessary ``to form a Cabinet on a broad
national basis,'' BTA said.
   The Communists have made a vague proposal for an interim
government that would includ figures from the nation's emerging
pro-democracy opposition. But the opposition has so far been
reluctant to accept the offer until the Communists say how much
power opposition leaders will get.
   Compared with Communists in neighboring countries, who have
ceded power to opposition groups after a wave of democratic reforms
last year, Bulgarian Communists have given up relatively little
power and faced a relatively weak though growing opposition.
   After his unanimous election by the Supreme Council, Lilov told
the delegates that the party, increasingly divided between
hard-liners and reformers, will have to make changes before the
election.
   Lilov, the party ideologist through the 1970s who was shunted
aside by Zhivkov about six years ago, directly criticized Atanassov
on Wednesday and told the party congress that ``we are lagging
behind.''
   ``If the programs are not competent and realistic, we will
lose,'' he said.
   The Supreme Council also elected Mladenov, Lilov and two other
top party figures _ Andrei Lukanov, a possible candidate to be the
new premier, and Defense Minister Dobri Dzhurov _ to a Presidium
that will essentially replace the Politburo under the new party
structure. There will likely be other members, but the panel will
be smaller than the former Politburo.
   The new 153-member Supreme Council is less than half the size of
the Central Committee it replaces.
   The new council includes some Communists who have called for
radical internal changes, including at least three members of the
Alternative Socialist Alliance. A leader of that reform faction had
said Thursday it intended to split with the party and form its own
socialist party.
   Not elected to the council were Politburo member Mincho Yovchev,
Prosecutor Vassil Mruchkov, alternate Politburo member Pantelei
Pachov and six of the nine regional party secretaries.
   The interior minister and one of his deputies were the only
representatives of the security forces on the council, and there
were five members of the armed forces. Most members are
technocrats, managers and other economic leaders.
   The delegates also created a 51-member commission on party

   The Communist Party has expelled former candidate
Politburo member Yuri F. Solovyov for violating party ethics by
purchasing a Mercedes-Benz for non-convertible rubles, Tass and a
party official said today.
   The harsh action against a die-hard Communist comes just three
days before a critical meeting of the Communist Party Central
Committee, where discussion of a new party platform is expected to
bring a heated debate between progressives and hard-lieners.
   Solovyov is still a member of the powerful Central Committee, so
his expulsion must be confirmed when it meets on Monday and
Tuesday, said Vladimir Kiryanov of the Leningrad party's press
office. He confirmed that Solovyov was accused of violating rules
on car purchases.
   If his ouster is upheld, Solovyov will lose his pension and
numerous other privileges, Kiryanov said.
   The expulsion was another humiliation for Solovyov, the former
hard-line Leningrad party chief who was defeated during the spring
in the vote for parliament despite having no opposition. More than
50 percent of the voters crossed his lone name off the ballot.
   Solovyov also was a candidate, or non-voting, member of the
party's ruling Politburo in the Kremlin until being demoted last
summer. He had been criticized for resisting the reforms of
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The Tass report implied that Solovyov abused his position to
obtain the vehicle, but Kiryanov refused to elaborate. Top
Communists have enjoyed special privileges like foreign cars and
luxury food allotments for decades.
   Former Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, now blamed for economic
stagnation and corruption during his tenure, was known for his love
of fancy Western cars.
   The Tass article implied that others in the generally
conservative Leningrad party leadership might be threatened.
   It said the local prosecutor had been asked to investigate
whether other Communist leaders bought their cars in violation of
the law. Neither Tass nor Kiryanov explained the precise violation.
   Solovyov is one of many hard-liners based in Leningrad. His
replacement as Leningrad party chief, Boris Gidaspov, is considered
one of the leading hard-liners in the Soviet Union.
   Solovyov was expelled at an emergency meeting of the Leningrad
party committee on Thursday, the day after the sensational
Leningrad TV program 600 Seconds broadcast a report showing his
name on an auto registration list. Journalist Alexander Nevzorov
told viewers it had become easy to buy a Mercedes-Benz 280-S
automobile for 9,780 rubles.
   Rubles are worthless on the international market, so such a
statement implies that the Soviet government took rubles from the
buyers and paid for the cars from its scarce store of foreign
currency. Nevzorov noted in the broadcast that 9,780 rubles is
lower even than the state price for a Soviet-made Volga, editor
Alexander Borisoglebsky confirmed today.
   Shortages require normal would-be buyers to wait years or pay a
vastly higher black-market price. Privileged people in the Soviet
Union, however, can skip to the head of the line.

<HEAD>Cult Members Describe Shootings in Videotapes</HEAD>

   Before a family of five was shot to death last
April, cult leader Jeffrey Don Lundgren invited them to his farm
for their last meal, according to a report published today.
   Citing videotaped statements two cult members gave federal
authorities, today's editions of The Plain Dealer said Dennis
Avery, his wife, Cheryl, and their three daughters were led one by
one inside a barn, where they were gagged, tied and shot.
   Several cult members carefully covered the bodies with lime and
stone and then heaped tons of trash on a common grave while
Lundgren, his wife and son retrieved Averys' belongings from a
nearby motel, the newspaper said.
   The descriptions of what authorities have called a religious
sacrifice were among videotaped statements that federal authorities
in Missouri and California took from six cult members indicted in
the killings of the Avery family.
   Lundgren, a defrocked lay minister of the Reorganized Church of
Jesus Chirst Latter Day Saints, reportedly told his followers that
the family had to be sacrificed so the cult could be cleansed
spiritually and leave for the wilderness to prepare for the second
coming of Christ.
   The bodies of the Avery family were found early last month on
the farm in Kirtland, 30 miles east of Cleveland.
   In the taped statements, Lundgren's wife, Alice E. Lundgren, 38,
and cult members Susan Luff, 31, Tonya J. Patrick, 33, and her
husband, Dennis S. Patrick, 35, said they feared for their lives
and dared not defy Lundgren, the newspaper said. They said they
lied to family and friends about their lives with Lundgren, a
leader they called ``prophet'' and ``father.''
   The four said they did not take part in the killings and found
out about them later.
   But two other cult members, Ronald B. Luff and Richard E. Brand,
described the killings in statements to officers of the U.S. Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in Kansas City, the newspaper said.
   Thirteen people have been arrested in the case. Charges filed
against them range from aggravated murder to kidnapping.
   The day after the April 17 shootings, 20 FBI agents and Kirtland
policemen who had been monitoring the cult's activities came to the
farm, questioning each of the cult members, who said they were not
being held against their will.
   That night, the cult members packed and left for West Virginia
and later went to Missouri before the cult split up. The bodies
were not found until months later.
   Lawyers for 13 defendants in the case were entitled to see the
statements given to the federal agents. The tapes were shown
Wednesday to defense lawyers.

   Prime Minister V.P. Singh was quoted
today as warning Pakistan that India is ready to fight if necessary
over Kashmir, where two weeks of secessionist violence have left at
least 73 people dead.
   Moslem militants today shot and killed a Hindu businessman in
Indian-controlled Kashmir. It was the first reported attack on a
Hindu civilian since Islamic militants took to the streets in the
northern area bordering Pakistan.
   In his remarks today, Singh said if Pakistan wants a
confrontation over Kashmir, the ``Indian people and army are ready
to give a befitting reply,'' the United News of India news agency
reported.
   Singh's statements, made at a state government function in the
eastern city of Calcutta, were the prime minister's first public
remarks on possible hostilities between the countries.
   India and Pakistan have gone to war three times since they were
partitioned in 1947 upon gaining independence from Britain. Two
wars have been over Kashmir, a region also claimed by
Moslem-dominated Pakistan.
   India, where Hindus predominated, accuses Pakistan of arming the
separatists. Pakistan denies the charge and accuses India of trying
to suppress the independence movement.
   Police today set up road blocks at major intersections in the
northern city of Srinagar on the Moslem sabbath, fearing more of
the separatist violence, witnesses said.
   Police said militants and paramilitary federal troops exchanged
gunfire, but no one was injured.
   A police official, Gov. Jagmohan, said the Hindu businessman,
Satish Tikku, was shot in the head by two unidentified gunmen at
his home in Srinagar.
   Police sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Tikku
probably was killed because the militants suspected him of being a
police informer _ not because he was a Hindu.
   But Jagmohan ordered increased security in the predominantly
Hindu Jammu region of Jammu-Kashmir state to prevent retaliatory
attacks on Moslems, a government source said, also speaking on
condition of anonymity. The rest of the state is mainly Moslem.
   An around-the-clock curfew was lifted for only six hours today,
compared with 12 hours earlier in the week.
   The daily curfew was imposed Jan. 20 when Moslem militants took
to streets and clashed with police. The militants want to free this
part of Kashmir from Indian rule and create an independent state or
become part of Moslem-dominated Pakistan.
   Between Jan. 20 and Jan. 25, at least 72 people, mostly
demonstrators, were killed in battles with security forces. Before
today's attack, the government had said there was little violence
since then.
   Paramilitary troops and state policemen today partially blocked
roads with steel drums and checked passing vehicles, the witnesses
said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Each barrier was backed
by sandbagged bunkers manned by 11 policemen, they said.
   Mass prayers are held at mosques on the Moslem sabbath, and they
have ignited protests in the past.
   Reporters for The Associated Press and Agence France-Presse, the
French news agency, received expulsion orders Thursday night, but
it was not clear when or how those orders would be enforced.

<HEAD>Factory Orders Rose 1.9 Percent in December</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Orders to U.S. factories for manufactured
goods rose 1.9 percent in December and closed out the year up 6.4
percent, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said orders for both durable and
non-durable manufactured goods totaled a seasonally adjusted $244.2
billion in the final month of 1989 after rising 2.4 percent in
November.
   The increase put orders for the year at $2.83 trillion after a
9.7 percent increase in 1988, the largest since 1983.
   Durable goods were up 5.9 percent for the year, following gains
of 11 percent in 1988 and 7.6 percent in 1987.
   For much of the year, Federal Reserve interest rate policies
held back orders for durable goods _ big-ticket items expected to
last more than three years _ because many of those goods are
financed through loans.
   But durable goods orders started to perk up late this fall and
jumped 4.8 percent in November and 3.2 percent in December.
   After the December report, analysts said it appeared the
manufacturing sector of the economy was stabilizing.
   But the manufacturing sluggishness through much of 1989 was
reflected in the report's figures for the entire year: While
durable goods orders were up 5.9 percent to $1.52 trillion, they
advanced at their slowest pace since a 0.4 percent gain in 1986.
   In addition to new orders, the Commerce Department said
shipments of manufactured goods fell 0.5 percent in December to
$231.8 billion, while inventories dropped 0.4 percent to $371.5
billion.
   If inventories increase without a corresonding gain in new
orders, it could signal produciton cutbacks in the future as
factories attempt to get rid of goods on shelves and back lots.
   Orders for durable goods rose 3.2 percent in December to $134.4
billion, paced by transportation equipment which was up 11.2
percent to $40.9 billion.
   Large increases in aircraft, shipbuilding and tanks more than
offset a decline in motor vehicles, the department said. Without
the transportation category, orders would have edged up 0.2 percent.
   Electrical machinery orders increased 5 percent to $22.7
billion, offsetting a decline of 4.7 percent in non-electical
machinery to $21.6 billion.
   Primary metals orders were down 3.8 percent to $10.8 billion.
   The often-volatile defense orders were off 11.6 percent to $9.96
billion. Excluding defense, orders would have been up 2.5 percent.
   Non-durable orders were up 0.3 percent to $109.9 billion, led by
a large increase in petroleum products.
   In the key category of non-defense capital goods, a barometer of
business investment plants, orders rose 18 percent in December to
$45.9 billion.

   Freezing rain and snow fell in parts of the Plains, Mississippi
Valley, Great Lakes region and Midwest today as an arctic air mass
moved south with plummeting temperatures.
   Heavy snow was expected today in Colorado, Kansas and Missouri,
and showers extended across the upper Ohio Valley and the lower
Great Lakes.
   Freezing rain and snow slowed commuters this morning across much
of Michigan and parts of northern Indiana and northern Illinois.
   Up to 13 cars were involved in fender-bender accidents on
Chicago's Lake Shore Drive before dawn, forcing police to close
southbound lanes briefly.
   In Texas on Thursday, at least four tornadoes touched down
outside Houston. Severe storms moved across a large area of the
state, triggering flash floods and tumbling mobile homes with wind
up to 85 mph at Cotulla, about 70 miles southwest of San Antonio.
   The Dallas-Fort Worth area received nearly 3 inches of rain
during the 24 hours ending at noon Thursday. Some Dallas streets
were closed by flooding.
   The Pacific Northwest looked for coastal rain and inland snow
today. On Thursday, Idaho's Grand Targhee ski resort received 10
inches of snow.
   Farther south, snow fell in the mountains of Nevada, Utah and
northern Arizona.
   Light snow that fell Thursday in Utah formed sheets of ice after
dusk, causing accidents along the Wasatch Front in the Salt Lake
City area. The weather was considered a possible factor in two
traffic deaths.
   The area around the nation's capital was due for increasing
cloudiness and rain by day's end and colder temperatures for the
weekend.
   North Dakota chattered through wind chills as cold as 40 below
zero on Thursday. Strong winds also lashed Montana, where Glasgow
weathered a wind chill reading of minus 57.
   Record highs Thursday were reported in Bluefiled, W.Va., with 71
degrees; Cape Hatteras, N.C., 73; St. Peterburg, Fla., 84; and
Tampa, Fla., 85.
   January was the wettest on record for Eugene, Ore., with 15.09
inches of precipitation.
   Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., which endured a record 46.8 inches of
snow in November and a record cold December, enjoyed a January that
averaged more than 10 degrees above normal and was free of subzero
cold. At 5 a.m. EST today, however, the mercury was at zero under
cloudy skies.
   Thursday's low for the Lower 48 states was 35 below zero at
Plentywood Mont. The high was 86 degress in Fort Myers and Naples,
Fla.

   Punxsutawney Phil, America's premier
groundhog, emerged from his burrow today and indicated in
``unmistakable groundhogese'' that he had failed to spot his
shadow, a sure sign spring is just around the corner, according to
Phil's followers.
   ``He stood proud, tall and confident, surveyed the throng of
loyal followers, peered skyward toward the east and then fixed his
eyes groundward,'' said county judge Edwin Snyder. He is a member
of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club's exclusive Inner Circle, which
each year decides in advance whether Phil will ``see'' his shadow.
   Snyder said Phil ``turned to Groundhog President Jim Means and
signaled to him in unmistakable groundhogese, `There is no shadow
today.'''
   The squirming, 10-pound woodchuck was pulled from his man-made
burrow atop Gobbler's Knob at sunrise, 7:27 a.m. Means held the
groundhog up to his ear to hear the once-a-year prediction, then
lifted him toward Snyder.
   The approximately 1,500 people who had gathered under cloudy
skies and in light rain cheered as Phil's forecast was announced.
   ``I've always wanted to come to this event ever since I was a
kid,'' said Peter Teicher, 49, of Los Angeles. ``I'm really
excited. I couldn't sleep last night. It's a real thrill.''
   Other prognasticating groundhogs around the country followed
Phil's lead and also failed to see their shadows.
   Legend has it that if the famous groundhog sees his shadow when
he emerges from his bungalow at sunrise on Feb. 2, there will be
six more weeks of winter. If he doesn't, spring is supposedly just
around the corner.
   ``You know and I know that Feb. 2 is too darn early to expect
spring to come,'' said Tim Clark, executive editor of The Old
Farmer's Almanac.
   But the two-legged variety of weather forecasters are still
curious about what Phil has to say on Groundhog Day.
   ``I definitely do watch to see what he does. I didn't say I
believe it. I say I watch it,'' said Albert Peterlin, a hydrologist
for the National Weather Service in Harrisburg.
   ``This has a little bit of history and fact,'' he said.
``Animals respond to temperature and environment as it occurs.''
   Before today, Phil had predicted an early spring only nine times
since 1887, when German-born farmers initiated the yearly event in
this small western Pennsylvania town.
   The farmers borrowed from the legend of Candlemas, a Christian
holiday celebrating the first time the infant Jesus was taken to
the temple. An old Scottish couplet claims, ``If Candlemas be fair,
there'll be two winters in the year.''
   Groundhogs, part of the rodent family, usually hibernate by
December and stay underground until April or so, but sometimes
venture out early if the weather is mild.
   ``Phil's never been wrong,'' boasted Means, 66.
   The 14 local businessmen who comprise the Inner Circle decide
well in advance what Phil's forecast will be. Group members stages
several rehearsals before Groundhog Day, when they don top hats and
tails for the event.
   Phil's handler, Bud Dunkel, sported a fake fur hat resembling a
groundhog.
   Every other day of the year, Phil lives at his heated,
air-conditioned hutch at the local library with two other
groundhogs, Philomena and Barney.
   As far as The Old Farmer's Almanac is concerned, February _ at
least around Punxsutawney _ will be extremely cold and snowy
followed by similar weather in early March.
   The National Weather Service is calling for a warmer than usual
February, but a colder than usual March and April.
   ``If I were to give you the scientific point of view, I think it
would be cold for the rest of this winter,'' said meteorologist
Victor Nouhan. ``Of course, that's worth a grain of salt.''
   Groundhog Octorara Orphie also saw no shadow in central
Pennsylvania's Quarryville. And neither did West Virginia's Concord
Charlie as he was ``wandering around campus to see if any flowers
are up,'' said Tom Bone, public information director for Concord
College in Athens.
   Ditto for French Creek Freddie at the French Creek Wildlife
Preserve in Upshur County in West Virginia and General Lee at the
Yellow River Game Ranch in Lilburn, Ga.
   The newest addition to the groundhog lineup, Little Hog, made
his debut at the Indianapolis Zoo with fans joining in a rousing
chorus of ``You Are My Sunshine'' on kazoos. But there was no
sunshine and no shadow there.

   Olive oil, a food already anointed with
cholesterol-lowering charisma in a health-conscious age, appears to
also lower blood pressure and blood sugar, say doctors who studied
almost 5,000 Italians.
   By contrast, consumption of butter and other saturated fats was
found to be associated with higher blood cholesterol, blood
pressure and blood sugar, the doctors reported in today's Journal
of the American Medical Association.
   ``The message is not new, in a sense,'' said the lead
researcher, Dr. Marizio Trevisan, associate professor in medicine
at the State University of New York at Buffalo.
   Doctors have been telling people that a diet low in saturated
fats will help lower the risk of developing heart disease, he noted.
   But olive oil, a form of unsaturated fat with proven
cholesterol-lowering ability, may have ``an overall impact on
coronary risk that is much stronger than we expected,'' Trevisan
said in a telephone interview Thursday.
   ``I don't want to come out as a salesman for olive oil,''
Trevisan cautioned. ``I think the results are exciting and
interesting, but ... a number of studies need to be done.''
   Dr. Scott M. Grundy, director of the Center for Human Nutrition
at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School in Dallas,
agreed in calling for further research to confirm the findings.
   ``I'm very loath to draw conclusions from epidemiology
(population studies), especially when there's not a broad base of
epidemiological data,'' Grundy said in a telephone interview.
   Grundy added: ``The study provides a consistency with what's
already known in terms of lipids (fatty substances in the blood),
and that's reassuring. It is of interest that other risk factors
seem to be affected.''
   Saturated fats, derived largely from meat, dairy products, and
coconut and palm oils, are usually solid at room temperature.
Polyunsaturated fats, made from vegetable products, usually are
liquid at room temperature.
   The polyunsaturates _ like the monounsaturates, including olive
oil _ are blood-cholesterol reducers and help protect the body
against heart disease.
   Researchers analyzed data on 4,903 healthy Italian men and women
ages 20 to 59 in a study exploring traits linked to
atherosclerosis, a thickening of the arteries due to a buildup of
fatty deposits, which causes more deaths in the United States than
any other condition.
   The study was conducted at nine medical centers throughout
Italy. People were questioned about their eating habits and were
tested for levels of blood cholesterol, blood pressure and blood
sugar.
   Levels of saturated fat consumption were found to differ up to
40 percent, with the lowest levels in the south, where people eat a
diet high in olive oil, vegetables and starches traditional to the
Mediterranean.
   In northern Italy, people consume more butter and other animal
fats.
   In both sexes, higher consumption of butter and margarine was
associated with significantly higher levels of blood sugar,
increased blood pressure and increased blood-cholesterol levels,
the study said, though the link was statistically significant only
in men.
   Whether elevated blood sugar levels play a role in heart disease
is unclear and is under intensive study, Trevisan said.
   Diabetes, in which the body fails to process blood sugar
properly, is known to be linked with heart disease, but subjects in
the Italian study all had blood-sugar levels in the normal range,
rather than in the diabetic range.
   Italians who consumed more olive oil had significantly lower
levels of systolic blood pressure (pressure during the heart's
contraction), and of blood sugar and blood cholesterol, researchers
said.
   The Italian study found that diets high in other polyunsaturated
oils _ corn oil, soybean oil, sunflower oil and mixed vegetable oil
_ were linked significantly to lower cholesterol and blood-sugar
levels in both sexes.

   Today, Pretoria's President F.W. de Klerk made important
announcements that go a long way toward creating a climate
conducive to negotiations. We welcome the lifting of the ban on the
ANC and other organizations. We also welcome other positive
measures announced by F.W. de Klerk, such as the suspension of the
death sentence, the release of some political prisoners, the ending
of media restrictions and the lifting of restrictions on
ex-detainees.
   We are, however, greatly concerned that the Pretoria regime has
taken the decision that some political prisoners will not be
released, that the state of emergency is not lifted in its entirety
and that the practice of detention without trial will continue.
   These decisions subtract rather than add to the process of
creating the proper political climate. They must be reviewed and
changed without delay.
   We urge the Pretoria regime to release Nelson Mandela without
further delay. Questions concerning his personal security cannot be
and are not the exclusive concern of the South African regime. They
must be decided together with his organization, the ANC.
   The ANC will take urgent measures to review the new situation
that has emerged, to determine the steps we have to take to move
our country further forward toward finally ending the apartheid
system. This will include a process of consultation with the mass
democratic movement of our country and all other anti-apartheid
forces.
   The normalization of relations between South Africa and the rest
of the world must continue to depend on ending the apartheid
system. We therefore expect that no country committed to ending
white-minority domination in South Africa will do anything to
lessen the isolation of the apartheid regime.
   The ANC remains committed to doing everything in its power to
end the apartheid system as quickly as possible and by all means
possible, including negotiations. The review of the new situation
will therefore include an assessment of the prospects of genuine
negotiations to end the apartheid system.
   This situation also calls for the greatest unity of all forces
within our country that are committed to the perspective of a
united, democratic and non-racial South Africa. We therefore call
on all our people to work for this unity, with even greater vigor.

   A member of the governing Conservative Party said
today that files have disappeared on a 1970s disinformation
campaign to discredit the IRA that critics say grew into a smear
campaign against some British politicians.
   On Thursday, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher rejected calls for
a full inquiry into the case. She said there was no evidence that
the security services' operation was extended to undermine
politicians.
   Lawmakers who claim they were targets of such an operation
continued to press for a full investigation.
   ``The time has come for a full, open and honest uncovering of
these things so that people in Northern Ireland can know that this
has come to an end, the dirty tricks that were carried on,'' the
Rev. Ian Paisley, the province's militant Protestant leader, told
the House of Commons Thursday.
   Paisley allegedly was targeted because of fears that his
political party might prop up a minority Labor Party government.
   In an interview today with British Broadcasting Corp. radio,
Conservative lawmaker Michael Marshall said, ``When documents I
know ... have gone missing and there are other documents internally
which seem to have gone missing, one does begin to wonder whether
there is a systematic problem here rather than a series of isolated
incidents.''
   Marshall said seven such files had disappeared, but he gave no
details.
   Mrs. Thatcher has for years denied allegations by former army
press officer Colin Wallace of a dirty tricks campaign against the
Irish Republican Army and some politicians. The mainly Roman
Catholic IRA opposes British rule in Northern Ireland and wants to
unite it with the Irish Republic.
   On Wednesday, Mrs. Thatcher acknowledged in a letter to a
lawmaker in her Conservative Party that her denials had been based
on false information from civil servants.
   She said, however, that none of the allegations involve
activities since 1979 when she became prime minister.
   Her letter was released a day after the government confirmed the
existence of a covert operation codenamed ``Clockwork Orange'' to
feed lies to journalists reporting from Northern Ireland.
   ``A Clockwork Orange'' is the title of a novel by Anthony
Burgess, published in 1962, about mind control in a totalitarian
state.
   Mrs. Thatcher said she stood by her May 1987 statement that
there was ``no evidence of misuse of information by any member of
the security services'' and rejected a full investigation of the
case.
   In particular, she said, there was no evidence of any plot to
destabilize Harold Wilson's 1974-76 Labor Party government.
   Such a plot was described in ``Spycatcher,'' the memoirs of
Peter Wright, a retired senior officer in the MI5
counterintelligence agency.
   Wallace maintains he was dismissed in 1975, four years before
Mrs. Thatcher became prime minister, for threatening to expose the
campaign. He says that in addition to his regular army duties, he
led a secret psychological warfare unit in Northern Ireland in the
1970s.
   Wallace says ``Clockwork Orange'' began as an attempt to
discredit the IRA through false stories, such as the claim the
guerrillas had Soviet rockets armed with unstable explosives.
   He says it was later expanded to smear politicians such as
Wilson and Edward Heath, who was Conservative prime minister from
1970 to 1974.
   Tony Benn, a former Labor Cabinet minister, said another target
was former Labor prime minister James Callaghan, who was in power
from 1976 to 1979.
   Journalist Paul Foot said in his book ``Who Framed Colin
Wallace?'' that Wallace received detailed information on
homosexuality, bogus bank accounts, corrupt earnings and Communist
sympathies.
   Foot said the campaign aimed at stopping Labor from being
elected in 1974 and also at deposing Heath and former Northern
Ireland Minister William Whitelaw from top positions in the
Conservative Party.

   Thousands of blacks sang, danced
and chanted today in impromptu street celebrations following
President F.W. de Klerk's announcement of sweeping changes,
including legalization of the African National Congress.
   ``We had expected that Mr. de Klerk might deliver something, but
what he said has certianly taken my breath away,'' said Anglican
Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who could not stop laughing and smiling
throughout a news conference at St. George's Cathedral.
   ``We are probably seeing history in the making in South Africa.''
   A predominately black crowd of 5,000 broke into cheers and
whistles in the parade ground outside Cape Town City Hall when
anti-apartheid activist Popo Molefe gave them the news over a
bullhorn from the back of an open truck.
   The crowd marched peacefully through the streets, in and out of
the nearby train station, announcing over a bullhorn to startled
train passengers: ``This is an ANC station.''
   Scores of white policemen and white shopkeepers watched silently
from the sidewalks, some shaking their heads. But police riot
squads kept out of view on side streets.
   In Johannesburg, whites came out of their shops to take pictures
with instamatic cameras and many smiled as hundreds of blacks
danced and marched through downtown, waving banners and newspaper
vendors placards which declared: ``ANC Unbanned.''
   At the offices of the anti-apartheid Congress of South African
Trade Unions a huge black, green-and-gold ANC banner was hung from
the windows.
   Drivers stopped their cars in the street, honking their horns
and punching their fists into their air, as black workers stuck
their heads out office windows, whistling and shouting.
   Police halted the march with a line of yellow patrol vehicles,
chased some as they tried to march back to the union headquarters
and sprayed tear gas on demonstrators singing on the sidewalk after
they were ordered to disperse. No injuries or arrests were reported.
   In Durban, the sound of cheers intensified as a group of black
railway union members broke out of their strike settlement meeting
to dance and march through the city center.
   Leaders of anti-apartheid groups gathered around radios and
televisions, listening intently to the speech. When de Klerk
announced that restrictions had been lifted on 374 activists, many
of those who were under the orders broke into smiles.
   Blacks in the townships were out in the dirt streets between
their shanty homes, chatting, laughing and listening to the radio.
   In Cape Town, blacks and whites stood in groups with one person
reading aloud the stories under the headline of the afternoon
newspaper, which said, ``ANC Legalized.''
   ``The staying power for me would be the ability of Mr. de Klerk
to move very quickly now to do those things and to make them
concrete.'' said the Rev. Allan Boesak, a leading activist and
president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches. ``I have a
lot more faith in his ability now than I did a week ago,''
   At the downtown rally, Molefe said, ``We would be unreasonable
if we failed to acknowledge that of all the presidents, of all the
leaders of the Nationalist government, that in fact de Klerk has
taken the most bold step and has emerged as the most courageous.''
   However, Molefe noted the changes still had limitations.
   He said that if ANC President Oliver Tambo, recovering from a
stroke in Sweden, were to return to South Africa from his 30-year
exile tomorrow, he could still be arrested under the existing
Internal Security Act or the remaining emergency regulations.
   Winnie Mandela, wife of imprisoned ANC leader Nelson Mandela was
disappointed her husband was not released immediately from prison.
   ``We want to warn Mr. de Klerk we are not going to accept a bone
without any meat. ... The unbanning of the ANC, the South African
Communist Party and the Pan-Africanist Congress in the prevailing
South African climate is simply a recipe for further problems.''

<TEXT>
   Authorities exploded what appeared to be
a mail bomb sent to the NAACP branch in Washington County last
month before discovering it was a fake, authorities said today.
   An office worker collecting the group's mail from a post office
box in this western Pennsylvania town decided not to open a
suspicious-looking package after it arrived Jan. 19, said Louis
Waller, a former NAACP branch president.
   Postal officials X-rayed the box, which contained wires and two
batteries, but couldn't determine if it was a bomb until after it
was exploded by Pittsburgh police, said Dick Balya, a postal
inspector in Pittsburgh, 25 miles northeast of Washington.
   ``We think it might have been sent locally by some less than
rocket scientist type people,'' said Balya.
   The package contained an unsigned letter with racist remarks
aimed at both the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People and Jews, Waller said.
   ``Someone went to a lot of trouble to make us think it was a
real bomb,'' Waller said.
   The national NAACP sent warning to its 1,800 branches last
August after a tear-gas bomb was mailed to its Atlanta southeastern
regional office and again when its Jacksonville, Fla., branch
received a mail bomb on Dec. 19.
   About the same time as the December bomb was received, a federal
appeals judge in Alabama and a civil rights attorney in Savannah,
Ga., were killed when they opened mail bombs. The bomb sent to
Jacksonville and another sent to a federal courthouse in Atlanta
were defused. Authorities believe the incidents were racially
motivated.
   Washington County last year was the site of racial tensions when
former Pittsburgh Steelers football player Mel Blount announced
plans to build a home for trouble boys near Taylorstown.
   Members of the Ku Klux Klan distributed fliers protesting the
home in May, but Buffalo Township officials eventually granted
Blount a zoning change necessary to begin construction.
   Balya said investigators have found no evidence the package was
sent by the Klan. Even though the package was not a bomb, the
sender could be charged under federal postal regulations dealing
with mailing dangerous items, he said.

<HEAD>Bush Will Review Sanctions Against South Africa</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts graf 13, The sanctions, with sanctions.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush announced today he will
review U.S. sanctions against South Africa with congressional
leaders, calling Pretoria's decision to free imprisoned black
leader Nelson Mandela ``quite positive.''
   ``I think when people move in the right direction, it is
certainly time to review all policy,'' Bush said, speaking with
reporters aboard Air Force One before his arrival in Raleigh, N.C.,
for an appearance at North Carolina State University.
   However, Bush indicated any easing of sanctions would depend on
South African President F.W. de Klerk making good on his promise to
free Mandela. ``We want to see the policy initiatives go forward,
the release of Mandela,'' he said.
   Bush previously had indicated he would invite Mandela to the
United States once he is freed, and would also invite de Klerk.
   De Klerk announced earlier today that Mandela will be freed, but
not immediately.
   De Klerk also legalized Mandela's outlawed African National
Congress after 30 years of guerrilla war against white rule. He
said he would lift bans on more than 30 other opposition groups,
free all prisoners jailed for belonging to these groups, declare a
moratorium on executions, and scrap most of the restrictions
imposed during more than three years of a state of emergency.
   Bush called de Klerk's announcement ``very interesting and I
would say quite positive.''
   ``I view it positively and most people around the world will,''
he added.
   Referring to de Klerk, the president said, ``He recognizes the
status quo is not acceptable to him or the people of South Africa
and to a lot of people in the world who want to see a more just
society.''
   Asked if the announcement could lead to an easing of U.S.
sanctions imposed in 1986, Bush said: ``I want to talk to the
(congressional) leaders about that.''
   However, he indicated there was bound to be ``a lot of debate
and discussion inside the administration about what the next move
by the United States ought to be.''
   He said, ``I'm one who has not proposed additional sanctions.
... I don't want any additional sanctions, but I do want a review.''
   The sanctions include a ban on importing South African steel,
textiles, uranium, coal and agricultural produce. They also bar new
U.S. investment in South Africa, forbid new bank loans and end U.S.
landing rights for South African Airways.
   Earlier, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater welcomed de
Klerk's action as ``positive steps'' and said ``we remain hopeful
the release will occur as soon as possible.''
   Rep. William Gray, D-Pa., the House majority whip and author of
legislation imposing the sanctions, said Bush should hold off
bringing de Klerk to the White House.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., chairman of a Senate subcommittee on
Africa, also suggested that inviting de Klerk to the United States
would be premature.
   ``I urge caution before that step is taken,'' Simon said.
``State visits involving South Africa have been ruled out by past
administrations as long as we continue to have fundamental
differences with the South African government.''
   The Bush administration raised the possibility of inviting de
Klerk to the United States last year, but never followed through
after dozens of lawmakers objected to the visit.
   On Thursday, Fitzwater said Bush would invite Mandela and de
Klerk for separate visits if Mandela is released.
   Bush's purpose would be to ``determine how the U.S. can best
help South Africa move forward toward a non-racial government and
society,'' Fitzwater said.
   Releasing Mandela would be a ``significant step,'' Gray said,
adding, ``I applaud the president'' for wanting to meet with
Mandela. But before Bush sees de Klerk, the American president
should hold talks with a cross-section of black South Africans to
garner their views, Gray said.
   Gray also said South Africa would have to free all political
prisoners _ not just Mandela _ lift the ban on political groups
opposed to apartheid and end all residential restrictions before
Congress would consider loosening economic sanctions.

   Four top officials in the government
of Nicolae Ceausescu were convicted today of supporting his orders
to shoot scores of demonstrators and were sentenced to life in
prison by a military tribunal.
   The four men were convicted of being accomplices to a genocide
during the December revolution that toppled the Communist dictator
after 24 years, Radio Bucharest reported.
   Western diplomats have said as many as 10,000 people died in the
fighting between Ceausescu's Securitate forces and citizens who
joined with the army.
   The tribunal, the first to try leading figures in the Ceausescu
government, rejected a prosecution demand that the four be
convicted of the more serious crime of ``co-authorship to
genocide.''
   The five-judge panel ordered the seizure of all property
belonging to the four men _ including gold, jewels and large sums
of money _ and stripped them of their civil rights.
   The four, who had already pleaded guilty to the charge of
``complicity to genocide,'' stood solemnly as the tribunal
president, Col. Andrei Nitoiu, announced the majority verdict after
two hours of deliberation.
   Three of the four defendants _ Emil Bobu, 62, former secretary
of the Communist Party Central Committee and the third-ranking
member of the Ceausescu leadership, former state council Vice
President Manea Manescu, 74, and former Politburo member Ion Dinca,
62 _ stared at the judges, showing no emotion as the verdict was
read. Former Interior Minister Tudor Postelnicu, 59, bowed his
head, as he had through much of the five-day trial.
   Bobu, Postelnicu and Manescu said they would appeal, but Dinca
told the judge he would not.
   Manescu, while saying he was guilty, had asked for a lesser
sentence than the others, contending he had no part in the
repression of the demonstrators.
   The four Politburo members admitted they backed Ceausescu's
orders to shoot the demonstrators and did nothing to end his
dictatorship. But they all denied they gave direct orders to put
down the protests.
   The military prosecutor, Col. Aurel Cosma, urged the judges to
imprison all four for life ``on behalf of the thousands of victims,
of orphans, children, men, women and brave military men who were
killed'' in the revolution.
   Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, fled Bucharest by helicopter on
Dec. 22 as demonstrators neared the Communist Party Central
Committee headquarters. They were arrested, convicted of genocide
and ruining the nation's economy in a secret, summary trial, and
executed on Dec. 25.
   The Ceausescus were accused during their trial of killing 60,000
Romanians during their 24 years in power.
   The National Salvation Front, which took power during the
revolution, later abolished the death penalty, make life in prison
the maximum penalty.
   The convictions of the four former officials came after a tense
standoff between the National Salvation Front and a growing
opposition movement.
   The front, made up of former Communist officials, intellectuals
and reformers, came under fire after announcing that it would field
candidates in the May 20 elections. Critics said candidates fielded
by theprovisional governmentwould have an unfair advantage.
   The opposition argued that the unelected National Salvation
Front couldn't be a referee and player in Romania's first free
election since World War II.
   The crisis was defused for the time being on Thursday, when the
front formed a new governing coalition that includes opposition
members.

   African National Congress leaders today
cautiously welcomed the South African government's decision to
legalize their guerrilla group, but said the measures do not go far
enough to end apartheid.
   The ANC said in a statement that South Africa's white-led
government should remain isolated in the world community until it
agrees to take further steps. They said sanctions against South
Africa should be maintained and strengthened.
   ``Victory is in sight,'' said veteran ANC leader Walter Sisulu,
who described as ``progressive'' the steps announced by President
F.W. de Klerk at the opening of South Africa's Parliament in Cape
Town.
   De Klerk said he was legalizing ANC, lifting bans or
restrictions on more than 60 other organizations and freeing most
people who had been jailed for joining them when they were banned.
   He told Parliament he was relaxing state of emergency
restrictions and would soon free jailed ANC leader Nelson Mandela.
De Klerk did not say when Mandela would be freed, saying more time
was needed to settle issues related to his safety.
   The ANC statement said South Africa's main black nationalist
movement was ``greatly concerned'' that some political prisoners
will not be released, that the state of emergency will not be
wholly removed and that detentions without trial may continue.
   The ANC said Mandela should be freed ``without further delay,''
and that the ANC would share with the South African government
responsibility for his safety after his release. Mandela, 71, was
jailed 27 years ago for plotting against white-minority rule.
   Sisulu and other veteran ANC leaders were in Sweden on their
first visit outside Africa since being released from prison in
October, where they had served 25 years of a life sentence.
   Sisulu, asked whether negotiations with the government could
start now, replied, ``No. This is merely a preliminary.''
   ``He has done a great deal,'' Sisulu said of de Klerk. Asked
whether de Klerk had gone far enough, however, Sisulu said: ``No,
not yet. ... This is only the beginning. We want the end of
apartheid in South Africa.''
   Before negotiations can start, Sisulu said, the government will
have to remove soldiers and police from black townships and clarify
its attitude toward political exiles, including ANC President
Oliver Tambo, recovering in a Stockholm clinic from a stroke.
Sisulu said it was unclear whether Tambo could safely return from
exile.
   Sisulu said he was not confident that the South African
government was committed to ending apartheid.
   ``I don't know yet,'' he said. ``They have made a progressive
beginning and, on the basis of that, I hope they will go further.''
   In Harare, Zimbabwe, ANC spokesman Pallo Jordan said the
government still has laws it canuse to move against opposition
groups. ``Repressive measures can still be deployed (against us)
because the capacity is there in term of statutes,'' Jordan said.

   President Janez Drnovsek today said
he brought ``new ideas'' to the troubled province of Kosovo in a
personal effort to halt mounting ethnic unrest that has already
claimed at least 21 lives.
   No new demonstrations by ethnic Albanians were reported today
after 10 days of unrest, but a virtual general strike appeared to
be in force in the southern province, Yugoslavia's poorest region.
   ``Production has almost completely stopped,'' the state Tanjug
news agency said, adding that even those who showed up at their
jobs were refusing to work.
   At least 30,000 people throughout Kosovo have been on strike
since the unrest started on Jan. 24 at Pristina University,
official statistics show.
   The deaths resulted from clashes between the province's majority
ethnic Albanians and police. On Thursday, trainloads of minority
Serbs fled the province and tanks sent from neighboring Serbia
patrolled Pristina.
   ``I have come with some new ideas for solving the Kosovo
problem,'' Drnovsek told journalists after arriving in the Kosovo
capital. But he declined to elaborate, saying he would first
discuss them with provincial authorities.
   In the Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, Premier Ante Markovic and six
other Cabinet members, including the defense and interior
ministers, formed a special unit to ``monitor and control'' the
situation in Kosovo, Tanjug reported today.
   Ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's 1.9 million
people, have been demanding greater autonomy for their province
since the enactment a year ago of constitutional amendments that
gave Serbia, Yugoslavia's largest state, more control over the
province.
   Three people, including a young girl, lost their lives in
protests Thursday, Pristina radio said. That brought the death toll
in the recent unrest to 21, by official count.
   Serbian authorities maintain the changes were necessary to
protect the Serbian minority against alleged harassment by the
ethnic Albanians.
   Yugoslavia's liberal northern regions of Slovenia and Croatia
have backed ethnic Albanian calls for greater self-government to
the province.
   About 10,000 Serbs rallied in a downtown Pristina sports center
today demanding the federal government ensure order in the region
or they would arm themselves to do so.
   Ethnic Albanian ``nationalists have clearly demonstrated they
intend to secede from Yugoslavia in order to join Albania,'' Deputy
Defense Minister Adm. Stane Brovet told Parliament in Belgrade
today, Tanjug reported. ``Their intentions must be thwarted by all
means, including force.''
   But the Slovenian newspaper Delo today said there was no civil
war in Kosovo, ``only powerless demonstrators ... whose every act
is immediately misinterpreted in the province's politicized
atmosphere.''

   A furniture salesman who the FBI said was leading
a double life has been arrested in connection with an attempted
bank robbery and is a suspect in up to 20 more crimes, authorities
say.
   Edward L. Jones, 50, of Lakewood, once ordained a minister and
actively involved in his community and his children's schools, was
being held without bond pending a court appearance Monday.
   Jones has been charged in connection with a botched attempt to
blow open a safe at American Industrial Bank of Cherry Creek on
Jan. 10.
   Jones also is a suspect in as many as 20 bank robberies and
burglaries in the past year in Colorado, based on items recovered
in searches and other information, FBI Agent Bob Pence said
Thursday.
   Jones' wife, Shirley, said her husband didn't need money and the
family had seen no evidence of any extravagant spending. The couple
have two teen-age children.
   ``We were devastated; we're still devastated,'' she said.
   Jones, who once was a minister in an independent church, came to
the attention of authorities Jan. 23, when Lakewood police were
summoned to his home because his wife was concerned he might be
suicidal, said John Hunt, spokesman for Lakewood police.
   ``He had gone through some recent behavioral changes,'' Hunt
said.
   Jones was taken to a hospital for a psychiatric evaluation.
About an hour later, Hunt said, Mrs. Jones called again, saying:
``Come on back out here. I found some things that might be of
interest to you and also might show that he's having some problems
with coping.''
   She showed officers a trunk containing wigs, fake mustaches,
masks, a handgun, tools, nylons, a trench coat, assorted keys and a
stolen federal government license plate, police said.
   In the botched attempt to rob the Cherry Creek bank, a crude
homemade bomb was used to try to blow open a small safe. The
explosion merely singed the carpet, nicked a desk, blew a few holes
in the ceiling and loosened marble counter panels.

   Flames shooting from an engine forced a
Northwest Airlines DC-10 with 110 people aboard to double back to
Los Angeles International Airport shortly after takeoff early
today, officials said.
   No injuries were reported following the safe landing of Flight
84, bound for Minneapolis, airline and Federal Aviation
Administration officials said.
   Air traffic controllers noticed flames coming from the jet's
left engine shortly after it took off at 1:45 a.m., said Rich
Tornquist, FAA regional duty officer. He said the pilot shut down
the engine, dumped the fuel in the ocean and landed at 2:19 a.m.
   A DC-10 has three engines, but can safely land on two, said
Tornquist.
   Northwest spokesman Kevin Whalen in Minneapolis said the problem
was caused by a stall of air flow in plane's left engine.
   ``There was no fire in the engine per se. Any flames seen would
have been residual fuel that hadn't burned off because of the stall
in the engine,'' he said.
   The engine was repaired and the flight would be rescheduled for
later today after the crew has had a chance to rest, the airline
said.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
proposal for a 35-nation summit meeting now has the qualified
approval of the Bush administration _ provided a treaty is
completed to reduce troops and tanks in Europe.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III told the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee on Thursday the summit could be the forum for
signing the treaty and also provide a framework to deal with the
question of German reunification.
   But he said the Soviets first must agree to the principle that
free elections are a human right.
   Gorbachev proposed the summit be held this year and the 12
members of the European Community have endorsed the idea of a
far-ranging meeting. Baker said ``we would be willing to attend
such a summit'' to sign the treaty provided U.S. conditions are met.
   It is not clear, however, if the treaty can be concluded this
year. Taking Baker's qualifications into account, the summit
meeting presumably could be held next year as well, with U.S.
approval.
   A treaty to reduce NATO and Warsaw Pact troops and non-nuclear
weapons in Europe is nearing completion in Vienna. However, Baker
said there is disagreement on how to deal with combat aircraft and
helicopters.
   The Soviets insist that some of the planes the West wants to
restrict are defensive in mission and should be excluded from
limits.
   President Bush's proposal on Wednesday night for deeper cuts
also could complicate completion of the pact.
   The 35-nation conference would bring together the United States,
Canada, the Soviet Union, the Vatican and all the countries of
Europe except Albania. The same 35 signed the Helsinki agreement of
1975 that promoted human rights and, in effect, recognized the
post-World War II borders of Europe.
   Sen. Joseph D. Biden Jr., D-Del., had urged the Bush
administration to accept Gorbachev's proposal.
   ``If we don't provide a framework that accommodates East and
West German concerns to resolve the unification issue, events could
seize the day,'' Biden said.
   The senator earlier had urged the Bush administration to accept
Gorbachev's offer and to use the 35-nation conference to discuss
further cuts in troops and weapons, the German question and a
timetable for the removal of all foreign forces from Europe.
   Baker will hold talks next Thursday and Friday in Moscow with
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and possibly
Gorbachev. His endorsement of the summit proposal _ although
qualified _ represented another attempt by the Bush administration
to back the Soviet leader.
   Also, U.S. officials are trying to develop a strategy for
dealing with the German issue.
   On Tuesday, Gorbachev appeared to soften the Soviets'
longstanding opposition to reunification. ``It is essential to act
responsibly and not seek the solution to this important issue on
the streets,'' the Soviet leader said during a visit to Moscow by
Hans Modrow, the East German premier.
   Baker said the prospect of a 35-nation summit could serve as ``a
carrot'' to encourage completion by NATO and the Warsaw Pact of a
treaty this year to reduce troops and weapons in Europe.
   The treaty would set a ceiling of 275,000 for U.S. and Soviet
soldiers on foreign soil. President Bush, on Wednesday night,
proposed reducing the level to 225,000 and setting a sub-ceiling of
195,000 for Central Europe, which includes East and West Germany.
   It was not clear if the deeper cuts would be part of the treaty
now being negotiated in Vienna or become the basis of a second
treaty.
   Baker stressed the U.S. priority is to complete a treaty by the
time Bush and Gorbachev hold a summit meeting in Washington in the
second half of June.
   Referring to the treaty, which is known as CFE for conventional
forces in Europe, Baker told Biden: ``We would be willing to attend
such a summit provided we can get a CFE agreement completed and
signed at such an event.''
   Also, Baker said, a scheduled review in 1992 of compliance with
the Helsinki agreement should be held, as well.

   Renegade Gen. Michel Aoun's troops
attacked a rival Christian militia's command post today in the
heaviest fighting in a 4-day-old confrontation that has reportedly
killed at least 100 people.
   President Elias Hrawi urged France and other countries to demand
that Aoun halt the fighting. Lebanon's Maronite Catholic prelate
called on both sides to end ``this mass suicide.''
   Police said at least 450 people have been wounded during the
conflict, and two people were killed and 23 wounded from stray
mortar shells and gunfire that hit Moslem west Beirut, which has
not been involved in the Christian fighting.
   Police said they could not say how many people had been killed
today because of the intensity of the clashes in east Beirut's
Ashrafiyeh and Karantina districts.
   They said the tank-led forces of Aoun, moving behind a howitzer
barrage of 20 shells a minute, were trying to penetrate defenses of
Samir Geagea's Lebanese Forces, the main Christian militia.
   The Lebanese Forces said in a communique its forces were
``shaking off one tank assault after another.''
   In another communique, the Lebanese Forces said commanders of
Aoun's air base at Adma, north of Beirut, were ``negotiating
surrender terms with our forces.'' Adma, the communique said, has
been surrounded by Geagea's militiamen since Thursday.
   A police spokesman said Geagea's fighters were locked in
``close-range clashes'' with Aoun's troops on the southern edge of
Ashrafiyeh that also commands a street leading to Beirut's northern
entrance.
   The police spokesman, who requested anonymity, said Lebanese
Forces engineer units had planted mines along the southern slopes
of Ashrafiyeh and part of the street to hamper any attempt to
advance.
   The thuds of artillery explosions and the whooshing sound of
outgoing rockets echoed across the Lebanese capital.
   Archbishop Nasrallah Sfeir, patriarch of the Maronite Catholic
community, called on Aoun and Geagea to ``stop shooting
immediately.''
   ``Have mercy on people. Their lives and property are not yours.
You must stop this mass massacre now. You must stop this mass
suicide,'' he said.
   In an interview with France-Info radio, Hrawi said, ``I call on
the Lebanese of France and overseas to press the country in which
they are living to intervene to prevent Gen. Aoun from crucifying
Lebanon and the Lebanese.''
   The president, also a Maronite, fled his residence in Moslem
west Beirut as as repeated salvos crashed in the district, aides
said.
   The renewed fighting violated a truce struck late Thursday
between Aoun and Geagea and shattered a relative overnight lull in
east Beirut and the rest of the 310-square-mile Christian enclave.
   Aoun, who has been dismissed as army commander but clings to his
command of about 20,000 soldiers, attacked on Tuesday to try to
gain full control of the enclave north and east of Beirut where 1
million Christians live. Geagea has 6,000 militiamen bolstered by
several thousand reservists.
   Aoun was fired by Hrawi, who was elected in November under the
terms of an Arab League-brokered peace plan aimed at shifting
political power to the Moslem majority and ending a 15-year-old
civil war. The war has left 150,000 people dead.
   Aoun says the plan, approved by Parliament in October, provides
no fixed withdrawal timetable for Syria's estimated 45,000 troops.
   Geagea has neither accepted or rejected the peace accord, but
has recognized Hrawi as president.

   World leaders today hailed South Africa's decision
to free black leader Nelson Mandela and legalize the African
National Congress, but some urged continued sanctions to encourage
the dismantling of apartheid.
   President Bush praised the announcements as ``quite positive''
and said he will review U.S. sanctions against South Africa with
congressional leaders.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher immediately invited South
African President F.W. de Klerk to visit her and said she wants
Mandela to come as soon as he is free. Bush also has indicated he
will extend invitations.
   Mandela, 71, has been imprisoned since 1962 for helping to plan
the start of the ANC's bombing and sabotage campaign against the
white-led government.
   In his speech to South Africa's Parliament, de Klerk said
Mandela would be freed without conditions, but he didn't say when.
He said concerns about Mandela's safety were among the factors
affecting his release date.
   De Klerk's decision to free Mandela soon was a ``historic
landmark on the road to a new South Africa,'' Mrs. Thatcher said in
a statement.
   ``President de Klerk is to be congratulated on his decision,''
she said. ``Mr. Mandela will have a major role to play in shaping
his country's future.''
   Mrs. Thatcher, who has been instrumental in blocking harsh
economic sanctions against the white-led government, also said
Britain will in the future ``not discourage artists, scientists and
academics from going to South Africa.''
   The London-based Anti-Apartheid movement, the biggest in the
Western world, said its delight at the legalizing of the ANC was
``tinged with concern.''
   ``Simply reducing the level of apartheid repression does not
mean he (de Klerk) is committed to ending it,'' Anti-Apartheid
Movement secretary Mike Terry said.
   He said international pressures and black dissent in South
Africa have forced de Klerk to move, adding these pressures should
not be relaxed.
   ``He (de Klerk) has gone a long way towards creating a climate
for negotiations,'' he added. ``But obviously we are bitterly
disappointed that he has not announced the release of Nelson
Mandela.''
   In contrast, the British government statement said the ``changes
now taking place in South Africa vindicate a policy of contact
rather than isolation.''
   In Nigeria, Professor Gabriel Olusanya, director-general of the
Nigerian Institute of International Affairs, called de Klerk's move
a ``a bold and courageous step deserving of encouragement.''
   Although de Klerk did not announce the abolition of apartheid,
his refoms pointed toward the eventual end of the hated system,
Olusanya said.
   ``It is obvious that with all these measures, apartheid will not
remain what it used to be,'' he said.
   Canada applauded the speech but cautiouned that much work
remained before apartheid is dismantled. ``It's a historic step in
the right direction,'' said Mark Entwistle, a spokesman for the
Department of External Affairs.
   Scandinavian countries, which were among the first to impose
sanctions against the white-led South African government, praised
the decisions.
   Denmark indicated it may consider upgrading its level of
diplomatic relations, but joined Sweden and Norway in urging
continued pressure on South Africa to dismantle apartheid, its
system of legalized racial discrimination.
   Swedish Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson hailed the moves as ``a
great victory in the fight against apartheid,'' but said more steps
were needed for South Africa to achieve the full measure of
democracy and freedom.
   ``Until then, the struggle against apartheid must continue and
the pressure on the South Africa regime must be kept up,'' Carlsson
said. ``The South African liberation movements can count on
Sweden's support in this struggle.''
   Norwegian Foreign Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik also said Oslo
won't change its policy toward South Africa.
   ``Many of the opposition's demands have been met, but still
important things remain to be solved, first of all elimination of
the basic foundations of the system of apartheid and the actual
release from prison of Nelson Mandela,'' Bondevik said.
   The Finnish Foreign Ministry in Helsinki said that when de
Klerk's promises are carried out ``it will mean a great step in the
dismantling of apartheid.''
   Portuguese President Mario Soares, who last October became the
first foreign head of state to visit South Africa in nearly 15
years, congratulated de Klerk on his announcements.
   Soares said he heard the news of the decisions ``with great
pleasure and a sentiment of profound hope.''

   A ferry sank after being struck by an oil tanker

leaving 43 others missing, a newspaper said.
   Thursday's edition of the Shanghai newspaper Liberation Daily,
seen in Beijing on Friday, said the accident occurred near Anqing
in Anhui province, about 230 miles southwest of Shanghai.
   The report gave no details on the collision. It said a
preliminary investigation determined that the ferry was carrying
151 people, of whom 38 were known to have survived.
   Officials quickly formed a team to handle what it called the
``Jan. 24 sea loss incident,'' indicating the accident took place
on that date.

   An explosion at a brothel frequented
by soldiers killed one person and injured five others Friday, and
police believe the blast was caused by a military device, a news
agency reported.
   The explosion, which occurred around dawn in the two-story
building, killed a 15-year-old girl and injured four other women
and a man, according to the Zimbabwe Inter-African News Agency.
   Janitor Jezati Sandran said Zimbabwean soldiers regularly
visited about 100 prostitutes living at the 64-room former hotel.
The news agency said police believed the explosion was caused by a
military-style device.
   Several previous bombings have occurred at facilities occupied
by South African exiles and have been blamed on South African
government agents, but police told the news agency they do not
believe Friday's explosion was politically motivated.

   Fourteen children have been
identified by their parents in nude photographs seized from the
home of a day-care center owner charged with possession of child
pornography, police said.
   John Shaver, 56, was charged with five counts of possessing
child pornography after the photographs and magazines were found at
his home last Sunday. Police say they are considering additional
charges.
   Broward County officials on Thursday shut down Shaver's Rainbow
Learning Center, contending Shaver ``lacked good moral character.''
   Fourteen children who attended the day-care center were
identified by some of the 140 parents who went to the police
department Thursday night and sorted through 200 to 300 pictures
taken from Shaver's home.
   Only the faces of the children were shown to the parents, police
Sgt. David Geyer said. The children were pictured naked
finger-painting and playing in swimming pools, he said. No sexual
situations were depicted, police said.
   Three other children were tentatively identified by their
parents from among the photographs, police said. Those parents
planned to take another look at the photos today, as did many of
the other 60 parents who have yet to view the pictures, police said.
   A weeping Marla Echevarria, whose daughter was not among those
in the pictures, expressed relief but concern for other parents who
saw their children in the photographs.
   ``The pictures were horrifying,'' she said. ``I saw parents
hysterical in there.''
   The children identified in the photographs Thursday night were
undergoing medical examinations and counseling today at the
county's sexual assault treatment center, said police spokesman Ott
Cefkin. The interviews will be videotaped, he added.
   No new charges are expected immediately against Shaver, because
police must carefully examine the evidence and interview the
families first, he said.
   While Shaver admits owning the pictures police confiscated, he
does not consider simple possession as pornography.
   ``The way I understand child pornography is to tell kids to take
off their clothes and photograph them in the nude. I didn't do
it,'' he said. ``It's probably done ... but I am not that way.''
   ``It didn't cause harm to anyone,'' he said. ``A lot of people
have secret vices.''
   Shaver opened the day-care center in 1985. Thirty preschool
children attended the center and about 200 have attended since it
opened.
   ``I just feel dejected. I don't want to do anything,'' Shaver
said after he was notified Thursday that the Broward County Social
Services Division revoked his day-care license.
   Shaver has 15 days to appeal but said he did not want to fight
it.
   ``I never did anything improper (to the children),'' he said
repeatedly.
   When he applied for his license, Shaver said he wasn't asked
whether he ever operated a day-care center and did not volunteer
such information.
   In 1984 in Hawaii, Shaver pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge
of operating a day-care center without a license. The plea came a
year after the state of Hawaii revoked his license amid allegations
that he fondled several young girls at his center.
   He was never criminally charged and Shaver denies any wrongdoing.

   Violence flared in the Kashmir Valley on
Friday after an eight-day lull, and officials said at least four
people were killed in attacks by Moslem separatists and by police
firing on curfew violators.
   Prime Minister V.P. Singh made his first comments on an
increasingly belligerent exchange of charges between India and
Pakistan on the Kashmir issue, saying: ``The Indian people and army
are prepared to give a befitting reply'' if Islamabad wanted a
confrontation.
   Singh's comments, made in Calcutta, were reported by United News
of India. New Delhi has accused neighboring Pakistan, an Islamic
state, of fomenting the trouble in Kashmir. Islamabad has denied
the charges but said the people of Kashmir had a right to
self-determination.
   India and Pakistan have gone to war three times since they were
partitioned in 1947 on gaining independence from Britain. Two of
the wars have been over Kashmir, a region claimed by both Pakistan
and India, and there have been recent reports of increased military
activity along the border.
   The latest deaths in Kashmir raise to 76 the number of people
killed since the government ordered a crackdown Jan. 20 on the
Moslem movement for secession of Kashmir from predominantly Hindu
India.
   In Srinagar, the largest town in Kashmir, Hindu businessman
Satish Kumar Tikku was shot and killed by the militants during a
six-hour relaxation of curfew, Jammu-Kashmir state Gov. Jagmohan
told reporters.
   Tikku was the first Hindu civilian known to have been killed in
the violence _ other victims have been Moslem protesters or
government troops. Police sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Tikku was killed because militants suspected him of
being a police informer and not because he was a Hindu.
   In the neighboring town of Sopore, three people were killed when
paramilitary police opened fire on a mob gathered in defiance of
curfew restrictions early Friday, said police officials in Jammu,
also speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Jammu is the winter capital of the Moslem-majority state, which
includes the Kashmir Valley and the plains of Jammu to the south.
   The last reported deaths in the Kashmir Valley occurred Jan. 25,
when at least 15 people were killed. Two days later, the government
began relaxing the around-the-clock curfew for varying periods
extending up to 12 hours a day.
   On Friday, the relaxation was limited to six hours beginning at
5 a.m., apparently in fear of trouble on the Friday Moslem sabbath,
frequently a weekly flashpoint for violence by the militants.
   A government statement said militants and paramilitary federal
troops exchanged gunfire in the old district of Srinagar and two
people were wounded. It also said two people who hurled a gasoline
bomb at a paramilitary police bunker were arrested.
   The Moslem movement for an independent Kashmir dates to the 1947
partition of the subcontinent along religious lines. The Hindu
ruler of the state opted to join India, but Pakistan opposed the
decision, saying as a Moslem-majority area it should have gone to
Pakistan.
   A war over the issue in 1948 left parts of the valley under
Pakistani control.
   Kashmiri militants at first demanded union with Pakistan but
recently they have demanded a separate neutral nation which if
formed would be sandwiched next to India, Pakistan and China.
   Meanwhile, the government declined to enforce an order expelling
reporters for The Associated Press and Agence France-Presse from
Srinagar. They had been ordered expelled on the grounds their
presence was ``prejudicial to the security of the state.''

   He told of a dachshund _ Muffin _ who was brought in disoriented
and salivating heavily.
   ``Is it possible that Muffin got hold of some type of plant or,
uh, medication?'' Mickle asked, diplomatically.
   The owner said no. But Mickle traced the problem to an overdose.
   ``You know, I thought it was my roommate who had stolen my
marijuana, but it was Muffin,'' the man later admitted.
   Mickle estimated his clinic sees two pets a month that have
eaten illegal drugs, plus another two a month that swallowed a
prescription drug, alcohol or an over-the-counter remedy.
   The Illinois Animal Poison Information Center, which has the
only national 24-hour hot line for pets, handled 85 calls in 1988
for animals that had consumed marijuana, said operations director
Harold Trammel.
   Cocaine and alcohol ingestion were second with 35 calls each,
and other calls came in for prescription drug consumption,
amphetamines, hallucinogens such as LSD, and even one for heroin.
   Last month, Rob Lafferty of the Veterinary Medical Center in
Alpharetta treated a sheepdog that had eaten its owner's marijuana.
He said he gave the animal a drug that induces vomiting and ``about
the equivalent of a nickel bag came up.''
   Jason Trotman, a veterinarian with the 24-hour Animal Emergency
Care Center in Smyrna, said a man last month brought in a miniature
schnauzer that was in cardiac arrest from cocaine. The man said the
dog belonged to a friend.
   The dog died, and when Trotman tried to contact the man, the
name, address and telephone number he had left all turned out to be
phony.
   Both Trotman and Mickle said they do not report drug cases to
police.
   ``My main concern is saving the animal's life, not getting into
the owner's personal affairs,'' Trotman said.
   But for every animal taken to a veterinarian, more probably are
never treated because owners are afraid of being prosecuted for
possession, veterinarians say.
   Trotman said he often gets anonymous calls from people seeking
advice on how to help a pet that consumed cocaine or marijuana.
When the owners are told they have to bring the dog in for proper
treatment, they usually hang up, he said.

<HEAD>Study: Women Shaped Like Apples at Higher Breast Cancer Risk</HEAD>

   A new study indicates that weight
distribution plays a role in the risk of breast cancer, with
``apple'' shapes having a greater risk than women with
``pear''-shaped bodies.
   Women can gauge their risk of breast cancer by dividing their
waist measurements by their hip measurements, researchers from the
University of South Florida said in a study published Thursday in
the Philadelphia-based Annals of Internal Medicine.
   In a separate study, Texas researchers said they have identified
an enzyme that may help predict which breast-cancer patients are
most likely to suffer a relapse.
   Breast cancer is expected to strike an estimated 150,000 women
and cause 44,000 deaths this year.
   The Florida study, led by David Schapira of the H. Lee Moffitt
Cancer Center &amp; Research Institute at the University of South
Florida, found that women who carry their weight around the middle
are more at risk for developing breast cancer than those who bulge
at the hips and thighs.
   ``When we looked at women, obesity was not a factor. It's where
you have the fat,'' Schapira said. ``An overweight pear is still at
lower risk than someone leaner and apple shaped.''
   ``This refines our information,'' said oncologist Dr. Paul F.
Engstrom of the Fox Chase Cancer Center. ``Not all obesity is the
same.''
   Previous studies had established a link between obesity and
breast cancer, but Schapira said this may be because women tend to
gain weight in their abdomen.
   Fat cells in the upper part of the body, he said, are larger and
have a different metabolic and hormonal structure than those in the
lower part of the body.
   The Florida team studied 216 breast-cancer patients diagnosed
from August 1987 to June 1988 and 432 healthy women. The subjects
ranged in age from 25 to 83.
   Breast-cancer patients had significantly greater deposits of
upper body fat, plus greater waist-to-hip and abdomen-to-thigh
ratios, researchers found.
   Schapira said women whose waist-to-hip ratio is 0.77 to 0.80 are
classified as ``mildly apple shaped'' and are three times as likely
to develop breast cancer, a risk equal to having either a sister or
mother who had breast cancer.
   Women whose ratio is higher than 0.80 are ``very apple shaped,''
Schapira said, and are six times as likely to develop breast
cancer, a risk equal to having both a mother and sister who had
breast cancer.
   Ratios of 0.73 to 0.76 define a woman as ``mildly pear shaped,''
while women with ratios of less than 0.73 are ``very pear shaped''
and at low risk of getting breast cancer, he said.
   Last week, researchers in St. Louis reported that cholesterol
levels are closely linked with the way people carry their fat,
reporting it is healthier for people to be shaped like a pear than
an apple.
   The second study, published Thursday in the New England Journal
of Medicine, said the presence of an enzyme called cathepsin D
could help doctors determine which women should receive
chemotherapy or radiation treatment after breast-cancer surgery.
   The enzyme appears to play a part in the rapid production of
cancer cells, according to the study.
   Doctors at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San
Antonio found that breast cancer patients with higher levels of the
enzyme had 2.6 times the chance of a relapse and 3.9 times the
possibility of dying in five years compared with those who had low
levels.
   Measurement of the detection of the enzyme may help doctors
shape treatment for breast-cancer victims who don't show signs of
further cancer.
   About 30 percent of the patients experience a recurrence, and,
until now, doctors have been unable to predict which women are at
risk.
   The National Cancer Institute recommends chemotherapy for all
women not showing signs of further disease.

<HEAD>Father in Baby Swap Contracts for TV Movie</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Television movie rights have been sold to
the baby swap story of an 11-year-old who attorneys say was
switched in a hospital nursery with another newborn.
   Attorneys say genetic tests showed that for 10 years Kimberly
Mays and Arlene Twigg were raised by the wrong parents.
   Bob Mays, who reared Kimberly since birth, sold the rights to
their custody battle Thursday to Hollywood television producers for
an undisclosed sum that includes a college education fund for
Kimberly.
   Mays, who will be a script consultant, said he made the deal to
publicize his fight to keep his daughter and to pay legal bills he
estimates will top $100,000.
   Ernest and Regina Twigg, who were living in Langhorne, Pa., at
the time, sued to get genetic testing of Kimberly after they
discovered the girl they raised was not their biological daughter.
Arlena died of heart disease in 1988.
   Afterward, the Twiggs set out to find their biological daughter.
   Mrs. Twigg had given birth in central Florida's Hardee Memorial
Hospital in 1978 days apart from Mays' wife, Barbara. The girls
were the only two white girls in the nursery at the time. Mrs. Mays
died in 1981 from cancer.
   Mays consented last year to genetic testing of Kimberly on
condition that whatever the findings, the Twiggs would not seek
custody. The Twiggs agreed to settle for visitation, but a plan has
not been worked out.
   Mays, a roofing contractor, said his daughter is excited about
the deal. ``It's quite a thing to realize that all of a sudden a
movie is going to be made about you,'' he said.
   Los Angeles producer Michael O'Hara, co-owner of O'Hara-Horowitz
Productions Inc., said NBC has given him the go-ahead for the
project, but a script must still receive final network approval
before he is certain the project will be broadcast.

   The New Orleans Health Department won't need

   Suzy Shay of Direct China Trade Ltd. said $48,000 worth of latex
gloves arrived from China too late for the customer for whom she
had ordered them.
   ``That's the nature of the business,'' she said.
   Shay decided to donate the gloves to the city rather than find

they will be distributed to ambulance workers and health clinics.
   ``With the advent of the AIDS virus, this item has been
essential,'' he said.

   A union official who was allegedly shot on
orders from reputed mob boss John Gotti testified today he did not
know the men who shot him.
   John F. O'Connor, subpoenaed as a defense witness, detailed what
happened when he was shot in the buttocks on May 7, 1986.
   O'Connor, 56, of Brewster said he noticed four or five men
hanging around the offices of Carpenters Union Local 608, where he
was then business manager.
   While waiting for the elevator, O'Connor said he heard ``a
thunderous clap'' and felt something in his buttocks, although he
did not realize he had been shot.
   He said someone shouted his name and he turned and saw a man
pointing a gun at him, and that when he got on the elevator the
gunman fired more bullets into his buttocks.
   The prosecution rested its case Thursday after the jury heard
members of the Westies, an Irish-American gang, say on secretly
recorded tape that they shot O'Connor to appease Gotti.
   Gotti, 49, and Anthony Guerrieri, 60, are on charged with
assault and conspiracy in the retaliation shooting of O'Connor.
   The tapes were recorded at Rikers Island jail. Westies member
Kevin Kelly and his friend, Larry Palermo, had gone to visit
Francis ``Mickey'' Featherstone, a former Westies leader who was an
informer.
   Prosecutors said Gotti, reputed boss of the Gambino crime
family, sent the Westies to shoot O'Connor because he led the
trashing of a mob-affiliated restaurant that was being constructed
with non-union labor.
   Transcripts of the tape, the accuracy of which is in dispute,
show that Featherstone was the first to mention O'Connor's
shooting. Kelly and Palermo had no idea that a microphone was
hidden behind a picture on the wall near them when they visited
Featherstone in jail.
   At one point on the tape, Kelly said one gang member ``popped
him.''
   When Featherstone asked who requested the shooting, Kelly
replied it was done ``for the greaseballs.'' He said the Westies
volunteered their services to Gotti at the funeral of Gambino
family underboss Frank DeCicco.
   Defense attorneys have challenged the quality of the tapes and
the veracity of the transcripts.
   Acting Justice Edward McLaughlin told the jurors that what they
hear on the tapes and how they interpret it is what counts. He said
he was not sure he would allow them to take the transcripts into
the jury room during deliberations.
   McLaughlin told the jurors they will hear closing arguments
Monday and begin deliberations Tuesday.

<HEAD>U. of Wisconsin Regents Reject Proposal to Expel ROTC Because of
Ban on Gays</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIE AICHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   University of Wisconsin regents today
rejected a faculty-backed proposal to kick the Reserve Officers'
Training Corps from campus to protest the military's ban on
homosexuals.
   The board voted 13-3 instead to accept the recommendation of UW
System President Kenneth Shaw that the university strengthen its
effort to lobby Congress to change the military's policy.
   In December, the Faculty Senate at UW-Madison, the system's
largest campus, approved a resolution asking the university to
expel ROTC from campus in 1993 if the military continued to
prohibit gays and lesbians. Several other campus groups followed
with similar resolutions.
   But Shaw responded this week by saying he did not believe
severing the university's ties to the military would effectively
encourage the military to change its policy. Furthermore,
elimination of the military programs would hurt those students who
benefit from them, he said.
   There are about 440 students in Army, Navy and Air Force ROTC
programs at UW-Madison, which has an enrollment of 42,000, and a
total of about 1,300 ROTC students in the entire UW System, which
has 135,000 students at 13 major campuses and several smaller
centers.
   The regents listened to testimony from 15 people before voting
in favor of Shaw's resolution, which called on the university to
step up efforts it began in 1987 to lobby Congress and the military.
   ``I think it was the appropriate resolution to pass,'' said
Regent Erroll Davis Jr. of Madison. ``I think we have to work a
little harder than in the past. This resolution keeps the issue in
the front line and will force us to deal with it.''
   The resolution passed today differs from one approved by the
regents in 1987 because it requires UW administrators to report
annually to the board on the progress of its lobbying efforts to
change the military's policy.
   The 1987 resolution, which stated the university would seek to
lobby the military, was criticized recently for being too broad and
ineffective.
   The majority of regents said they agreed with Shaw that kicking
the military off campus would not effect the change sought in a
national policy.
   ``By opting out we will have nothing to say about this issue,''
Shaw told the regents. ``It's an issue that must be changed
legislatively.''
   An official at the Army's ROTC office at UW-Madison, who
declined to give his name, said ROTC officials would decline to
comment until seeing a copy of the regents' decision.
   Jordan Marsh, of the Wisconsin Student Association, said he was
dissapointed by the regents' vote but was encouraged by some of the
members' comments. Some regents said they would want ROTC banned if
the lobbying to change military policy fails.
   ``It shows they are serious about this and want the
discrimination stopped,'' he said.

<HEAD>Brady Distances Administration From Calls for Lower Interest Rates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady tried to
distance the Bush administration today from its earlier calls for
lower interest rates, saying those remarks were aimed at a
homebuilders' convention.
   Brady's comments were an indication the White House may be
trying to ease the pressure it has been placing in recent weeks on
the Federal Reserve Board to take actions to lower interest rates.
   Testifying before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress,
Brady said a statement made two weeks ago by White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater urging lower rates ``was not meant to be a contest
with the Fed.''
   Brady said he understood Fitzwater was aiming his remark at a
visit President Bush was scheduled to make the next day to a
homebuilders' convention. The housing industry has been in a slump
for the past year due to high mortgage rates.
   ``Presidents generally talk about lower interest rates at
housing conferences,'' Brady said.
   The White House generally refrains from commenting publicly on
Federal Reserve policy
   Asked by committee Chairman Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., whether
Fitzwater's comments were inappropriate, Brady said, ``Not in light
of what I understand was the reason for the statement being given.''
   Brady said he holds ``vigorous discussions'' weekly with Fed
Chairman Alan Greenspan in which disagreements are expressed, but
he declined to reveal the specifics of their talks.
   ``The administration probably has a bias toward growth that's
greater than that of the Fed,'' Brady said. ``At the same time, we
keep a weather eye on inflation.''
   Brady's remarks today came only four days before Federal Reserve
policymakers were scheduled to hold a closed-door session in
Washington where they will set monetary targets for the rest of the
year.
   On Jan. 18, Fitzwater told White House reporters that a recent
prime rate reduction by banks had not been passed through to the
general economy. He said, ``It's important occasionally to point
out that lower interest rates are normally good for the economy.''
   Fitzwater went on to cite Commerce Department statistics showing
a drop in housing starts as evidence that lower interest rates are
needed.
   The next day in Atlanta, Bush told the National Association of
Homebuilders that he wants interest rates to drop further.
   ``The truth is, there's one housing policy and one sales
strategy that's better than all others combined _ a healthy growing
economy with low, long-term interest rates,'' Bush said.

<HEAD>China Protests U.S. Sanctions Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China on Friday strongly protested U.S.
legislation imposing trade sanctions on China, saying Congress had
``wilfully trampled on the basic norms governing international
relations.''
   The protest was lodged by Vice Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu in a
meeting with U.S. Ambassador James Lilley, the official Xinhua News
Agency reported.
   Liu said he had been instructed to ``express our utmost
indignation and lodge a strong protest'' against the ``hegemonist
act of the U.S. Congress, which, basing its legislation on rumors,
has wilfully trampled on the basic norms governing international
relations and wantonly interfered in China's internal affairs.''
   The sanctions bill, passed Wednesday by a 98-0 vote in the
Senate after earlier approval by the House, was expected to be
signed into law by President Bush.
   The legislation, however, is largely symbolic, reflecting
actions Bush took earlier following the bloody military crackdown
of the student-led pro-democracy movement in China last spring.
   The bill gives the president the power to waive the measures if
he deems it in the national interest or if he can show Congress
there have been human rights improvements in China.
   The sanctions measures were originally part of a State
Department spending authoritization bill that Bush vetoed in
November because of a separate dispute concerning the Iran-Contra
affair.
   The sanctions suspend financial underwriting for U.S. companies
investing in China and aid under the Trade and Development Program.
Sales of military and crime control equipment are stopped and
controls are put on export of U.S.-built satellites and nuclear
cooperation.
   The legislation also calls for a review of China's most favored
nation trading status if repression against political dissidents
continues.
   Bush has already eased some sanctions, including the ban on
export of U.S. satellites, citing improved conditions in China.
   Bush also won a victory for his policy of keeping the door open
to better U.S.-China relations when the Senate last week sustained
his veto of a bill protecting Chinese students from deportation.
   The president said the bill was unnecessary because he had
already taken administrative measures to protect students worried
about persecution upon their return to China.
   China's strong response to the sanctions bill, however,
reflected the government's intense dislike of foreign criticism and
its past acknowledgments that sanctions have hurt the Chinese
economy.
   ``Certain U.S. congressmen, addicted to bias and disregarding
the realities, have readopted the amendment on sanctions against
China,'' Liu said. ``This can only reveal their stubborn anti-China
position and their true nature of pushing power politics.''
   He said China's road to socialist modernization will not be
deterred by economic sanctions and the U.S. actions ``are just like
lifting a rock only to drop it on their own feet. In the end, it is
the interests of the United States itself that will be harmed.''
   Liu said the U.S. government ``has an unshirkable responsibility
for the unbridled anti-China wave stirred up by the U.S. Congress.''
   He said China welcomes U.S. statements that it hopes to see
relations returned to a positive course, but the lifting of the
sanctions ``is a necessary condition for the return to normal of
the bilateral relations.''

<HEAD>Government Claims Capture of Airstrip; Rebels Deny It</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUANDA, Angola (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ranking military source said Friday the
army had captured a strategic airstrip in southeastern Angola after
a fierce battle, but a rebel spokesman in Lisbon denied it.
   The military source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the Mavinga airstrip fell Thursday after air force bombardment and
fighting that caused heavy casualties on both sides.
   He said two columns of soldiers had consolidated positions in
``all the area of Mavinga,'' including the airstrip and ``all other
important points.''
   Mavinga is considered a key to military control of the region
and vital to any government plans to attack the rebel stronghold at
Jamba, 120 miles farther south.
   Norberto de Castro, rebel spokesman in Lisbon, Portugal, said a
dispatch from Jonas Savimbi, chief of the UNITA rebels, reported
continued heavy fighting more than 15 miles from Mavinga.
   There has been no government comment on the operation.
   Savimbi, whose group's full name is the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola, cut short a five-nation European tour
Tuesday to return to Angola. He ordered the rebels on general alert
Friday for full-scale operations against government forces.
   According to the rebel radio, monitored in Luanda, Savimbi said
his call for an ``all-out attack'' was in response to heavy
shelling of Mavinga by government troops.
   He said the assault would include urban guerrilla attacks
intended to make Angolan cities ``uncontrollable'' over the next
two months, the radio reported.
   In Lisbon, de Castro confirmed government troops crossed the
Lomba River, a rebel defense line that passes as near as 12 miles
to Mavinga's north.
   A Western diplomat who follows the 15-year old conflict from
Lisbon said government forces were within about half a mile of
Mavinga on Thursday afternoon, but were short on supplies and might
not attack Jamba immediately.
   An estimated 10,000 soldiers began a drive on Mavinga late in
December from the government base at Cuito Cuanavale, about 100
miles to the northwest. Other government units were said to be
advancing from the west.
   Western diplomats in Luanda said the government could use the
capture of Mavinga to strengthen their position in new cease-fire
talks.
   Diplomats from the United States, Soviet Union, Portugal and
several African nations have been trying to revive negotiations for
an end to the civil war, which has continued since independence
from Portugal in 1975.
   A cease-fire agreement sealed between Savimbi and President Jose
Eduardo dos Santos last June broke down within days.
   Savimbi demands free elections as a condition for peace. Dos
Santos offers the rebels an amnesty and integration in a one-party
Marxist state run by his Popular Movement for the Liberation of
Angola, which has controlled the government since 1975.

<HEAD>Oasis of Democracy Ready For 10th Straight Peaceful Vote</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Costa Rica, an oasis of democracy in
Central America, celebrates its 10th straight peaceful presidential
election Sunday with a youthful two-time loser as the narrow
favorite.
   The election pits Rafael Angel Calderon, 40, who founded the
Social Christian Unity Party in 1984, against Carlos Manuel
Castillo, 61, of the National Liberation Party that has dominated
the presidency since 1948.
   ``We'll win because the country doesn't want to keep the same
party in power all the time, and because our organization has more
energy than theirs,'' said Calderon in an interview after a
campaign-closing rally Thursday night.
   The National Liberation Party has won seven of nine presidential
races since 1948. Incumbent Oscar Arias, who could not succeed
himself, beat Calderon in 1986.
   Calderon is considered the narrow favorite, although by
agreement between the parties and the Supreme Electoral Council no
polls have been conducted since Dec. 10, when Calderon had a 5
percent lead with 20 percent undecided.
   More than 80 percent of the 1.6 million-member electorate is
expected to vote, with the winner taking office on May 8.
   Voters will also elect 525 mayors and 57 deputies to the
unicameral National Assembly.
   The campaign has been relatively bland, with issues such as
corruption and drug trafficking backpedaled by both major parties.
   Castillo was hurt when his mentor, former President Daniel
Oduber, admitted accepting a party contribution of more than
$100,000 in 1986 from a man charged with drug trafficking in the
United States.
   Calderon denies accusations that he received even more money
from Manuel Antonio Noriega, and both say pervasive administrative
corruption is one of their top concerns.
   Both have also said they will continue to support the Central
American peace process, but neither has the moral authority of an
Arias, who won a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts.
   The Costa Rican economy has been damaged by instability in El
Salvador, Nicaragua and Panama, which made investors reluctant to
put money into any country in the region.
   Confidence has been partially restored by an agreement that
helped reduce the impact of the nation's $5.5 billion foreign debt
_ one of the world's highest per capita _ along with the downfall
of Noriega and elections in Nicaragua.
   Costa Rica is considered a staunch U.S. ally, and U.S. aid runs
about $90 million a year.
   In contrast to the rest of Central America, this country of
about 2.9 million has experienced peaceful elections every four
years since 1948, when Calderon's father was exiled for trying to
upset that year's result.
   After a 40-day revolution, the Calderon family was packed off to
exile and the army was eliminated.
   Rafael Calderon himself was born in Nicaragua and didn't live in
Costa Rica until he was 15.
   Castillo's literature refers to Calderon's background glancingly
by saying Castillo represents ``the ideal of what it means to be
Costa Rican'' _ which in his case includes graduate study in

   Calderon got 33 percent of the vote in 1982 while running for
his father's party, the Calderon Republicans, before he founded his
own party.
   He said he would view victory partially as vindication of his
father and partially as the result of a growing party with a
``strong mystique.''
   There are five minor candidates who are not expected to affect
the outcome, although one attracted some attention last week when
he was arrested on charges of child molesting, charges he denied.
   The minor parties complain that the major candidates are
offering similar platforms and that Costa Rica suffers from a
``two-party dictatorship,'' to the detriment of Costa Rican
pluralism.

<HEAD>Rehnquist Urges More Stamps Honoring Supreme Court Members</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist made a
pitch Friday for more U.S. stamps depicting past Supreme Court
members as he helped dedicate a stamp commemorating the court's
200th anniversary.
   The new stamp depicts John Marshall, the fourth chief justice,
whose likeness has appeared on postage stamps three times
previously.
   ``When it comes to members of the court who were not John
Marshall, the pickings are slim,'' Rehnquist said during a ceremony
at a larger-than-life statue of Marshall in the Supreme Court
building.
   Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank responded ``I get lobbied
for stamps all the time but I have never been lobbied more
graciously.''
   Noting that some 700,000 lawyers are doing business across the
nation, Frank quipped, ``If they would use stamps instead of faxes,
we could accommodate some of your wishes.''
   Of Rehnquist's 15 predecessors in the chief justice's post, four
besides Marshall have been depicted on stamps: John Jay, William
Howard Taft, Harlan Fisk Stone and Charles Evans Hughes.
   Two associate justices have been honored: Oliver Wendell Holmes
Jr. and Hugo Black.
   ``For those who are associate justices, there's some hope but
not a great deal,'' Rehnquist said as Justice William J. Brennan
and retired Justice Lewis F. Powell chuckled in the audience.
   ``There may be some who will feel that John Marshall has already
had more than his share of stamps depicting him as compared with
other distinguished members of this court and other distinguished
Americans,'' Rehnquist said.
   ``But this issue is designed to represent the judicial branch of
the United States government,'' he said, and no one person embodies
that branch more than Marshall, who served as chief justice from
1801 to 1835.
   ``He came to a court that was weak and insignificant,''
Rehnquist said. ``When Marshall left the court ... it was a
vigorous and co-equal branch of the government, with its power of
judicial review firmly established.''
   The Marshall depiction apparently was not the Postal Service's
first design choice for the court bicentennial stamp.
   Frank said that when an initial design was shown to Rehnquist,
``He opined that he hated it.''
   When Rehnquist suggested depicting Marshall, Frank mentioned
that Marshall had been on three previous stamps.
   ``The chief justice said, `A fourth will not be amiss,''' Frank
said.

   Gianfranco Contini, a renowned
linguist and literary critic, has died at the age of 78.
   Contini has suffered from partial paralysis since last year, but
the cause of his death Thursday night was not given.
   Contini was a professor of philology who gained worldwide
recognition for his analysis of the literary techniques used by
such Italian masters as Dante and Petrarch and for his critiques of
his contemporaries.
   Contini began his career as a professor in West Germany at the
University of Freiburg. He later taught at the universities of Pisa
and Florence, where he had his home.
   Among his publications are Critical editions of Dante's ``Rime''
(``Rhymes'') and of the Italian poets of the 13th century, his
``Esercizi di Lettura'' (``Exercises in Reading''), written at 25,
and his ``Letteratura dell'Italia Unita'' (``Literature of Unified
Italy'').
   Survivors include his wife, Margareth, and two sons.

<TEXT>
   West Germany's foreign minister today said he
is seeking support from the four World War II Allies for German
unification, and the Soviet Union proposed Europeans, Americans and
Canadians vote on the issue.
   In an interview published today in Moscow, Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said the outside groups should vote
or hold ``wide parliamentary discussions'' because they suffered so
much from a unified Germany in World War II.
   The Soviet envoy gave the Kremlin's strongest endorsement yet to
unification, but repeated conditions that this must not destabilize
Europe. The interview was carried by the official Soviet news
agency Tass.
   The West German official, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, made his
comments in a radio interview before flying to Washington to
discuss the prospect of unification with Secretary of State James
A. Baker III.
   Genscher said he also was consulting with British and French
officials and would meet with Shevardnadze next week.
   East Germany's premier, Hans Modrow, on Thursday outlined a plan
for a ``united fatherland'' that would be governed from Berlin but
would remain militarily neutral.
   Genscher joined Chancellor Helmut Kohl in rejecting neutrality
for the future German state. But he also said that East Germany, a
member of the Warsaw Pact, should not be drawn into NATO.
   Uniting the two Germanys has become likely since a pro-democracy
revolution ousted hard-line East German leader Erich Honecker on
Oct. 18, opened the Berlin Wall, formed a coaltion government and
scheduled elections in March.
   Earlier in the week, Genscher had said a reunited Germany should
remain a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization but the
territory of East Germany should not be part of the Western
alliance's military structure.
   In an interview with Deutschlandfunk radio, Genscher also called
for the European Security Conference, which includes the United
States, to convene this year to give ``the dramatic developments in
East and Central Europe a stable framework.'' The conference, he
said, should also discuss German unification.
   Kohl said in a statement issued by his office in Bonn on
Thursday that he would agree to talks with East German leaders as
soon as a new government is elected on March 18.
   But he added: ``I strongly reject the concept of German
neutrality.''
   West Germany is home to much of the West's military might.
   Officials in both Germanys welcomed President Bush's proposal to
cut superpower troops in Central Europe to 195,000 on each side to
correspond to a recent diminishing of tensions between NATO and its
rival Warsaw Pact.
   Modrow's government predicted the White House initiative would
speed a conventional armed forces reduction being negotiated in
Vienna.
   Modrow called for ``a reasonable time horizon'' for
reunification to be determined by an inter-German dialogue.
   The premier's reunification plan marked a turnaround in the
Communist-dominated government's position on the German question.
   The East Berlin leadership had previously resisted reunification
efforts as premature and destabilizing.
   But mounting economic woes and an accelerating exodus of skilled
workers to the West are forcing the nation's interim leaders to
address public pressure for a merger with prosperous West Germany.

<HEAD>Singh Wears Another Hat: No More Fur</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister V.P. Singh's trademark
fur hats are no longer the real thing.
   Following protests from animal lovers and ecologists, including
the minister of state for environment, the prime minister has been
sporting a new line of headgear made from synthetic fur.
   ``Some things are done without the awareness of the
background,'' Singh said in a letter addressed to Diana Ratnagar,
who heads the Indian branch of Beauty Without Cruelty, an
international animal rights trust founded in Britain in 1959.
   ``I have always stood for those who are voiceless. Therefore, my
decision to switch to an artificial fur cap as soon as I was
informed of the cruelty involved,'' Singh's letter said.
   The prime minister, who took office two months ago, frequently
was photographed wearing a curly dark Karakul lamb hat, prompting
protest letters and gossip-column notes in the Indian press. In the
past week, he has been seen wearing fake fur.
   Ms. Ratnagar and several of the letter writers said Karakul
lambs were slaughtered within 48 hours of their birth _ or
deliberately aborted before birth _ in order for the hatmakers to
obtain their hides before the curls straightened out.
   Ms. Ratnagar said Friday her group had given Singh one synthetic
Karakul hat and two other fake fur hats.
   ``We felt it was wrong for the prime minister to be wearing
Karakul caps,'' she said. ``Wearing fur today is a moral issue, and
we feel that people shouldn't be imitating him by wearing these
caps.''

   The Dalai Lama arrived Friday for
a five-day visit at the invitation of President Vaclav Havel.
   Chinese diplomats criticized the invitation as an indication of
political support for Tibetan separatism.
   ``I have explained to the Chinese ambassador that the Dalai
Lama's visit to Czechoslovakia is of a private nature. I wanted to
invite him a long time ago when I was not yet a president,'' Havel
said Monday. ``I want to meditate with him.
   ``If the Chinese republic is not satisified with this
explanation, I am sorry. The Dalai Lama is coming,'' Havel added.
   The Tibetan spiritual leader scheduled meetings with
Czechoslovakia's Roman Catholic primate, Cardinal Frantisek
Tomasek, and with other religious representatives, the official CTK
news agency reported.
   The new government installed after the November democratic
revolution has sought to remove the sanctions against religious
observance placed by the former Communist regime.
   Havel and the Dalai Lama are to spend all day Sunday in
``spiritual consultations and meditations'' in the presidential
country residence at Lany, west of Prague.
   The visit also includes meetings with journalists and a speech
on peace and spirituality to artists, scientists and the public in
a Prague theater, CTK said.

<HEAD>INS to Allow Some Immigrants' Families to Stay</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of illegal aliens who are spouses or
children of legalized immigrants will be allowed to stay in this
country under a new policy unveiled today by Immigration
Commissioner Gene McNary.
   The new policy announced by McNary reverses a three-year-old
practice of admitting only those family members for ``compelling
humanitarian reasons.''
   McNary said the previous policy was not being administered
evenhandedly by INS district offices and as a result split families.
   ``We can enforce the law humanely,'' McNary told reporters at a
briefing. ``To split families simply encourages further violation
of the law as they (illegal aliens) attempt to reunite,'' McNary
said.
   Under the new policy, spouses and unmarried children of a
legalized immigrant will be allowed to remain in this country if
they resided here on Nov. 6, 1986 _ the day the Immigration Reform
and Control Act took effect.
   The law granted blanket amnesty to illegal aliens who could
prove they were residing in the country before Jan. 1, 1982. It
also provided immigrant status to undocumented farm workers who
could prove they worked 90 days picking crops in this country
during any of three years.
   More than 3 million illegal aliens have been granted amnesty
under the 1986 law.
   The new policy effects the spouses and children of aliens who
received legal resident status under the 1986 law. These people
typically followed their relatives to this country but did not
arrive in time to qualify for amnesty and are still illegal aliens.
   Under the Reagan administration policy reversed by McNary, INS
deported only a small number of people following case-by-case
reviews of some 10,000 applicants.
   But McNary said that policy ``has not been evenly and uniformly
enforced throughout the country'' as ``some district directors were
very lenient and other ones were very strict.''
   The new policy should encourage more people to apply for the
extended voluntary departure status, which allows qualified aliens
to remain in this country while awaiting permission to immigrate.
The only difference is they will wait in this country instead of
their homeland, he said.
   These aliens will be given work permits and will be eligible to
collect social welfare benefits. But yearly reviews of each alien
will be conducted to ensure they are productive citizens.
   Those who commit crimes or become ``public charges'' by
depending on welfare would be subject to deportation.
   McNary said the new order is in line with legislation that has
passed the Senate and is awaiting action in the House.
   The new policy was criticized by the Federation for American
Immigration Reform as ``just plain illegal.''
   ``It ignores congressional intent, and undermines the delicate
compromise crafted over a decade of national debate. It's
over-broad, arbitrary, capricious and illegal,'' said Dan Stein,
the group's executive director.
   ``At issue here,'' said Stein, ``is who defines the basic
immigration law, Congress and the American people or the
bureaucrats and pressure groups that surround them. It's an open
invitation for future illegal immigration.''

<TEXT>
   A thin line of white police on
Friday silently watched the pulsating throng of singing and
chanting blacks celebrating the legalization of the African
National Congress.
   Small groups of glum-looking white civilians stood behind the
police, staring at the jubilant blacks waving the organization's
black, green and gold flag as they chanted, ``ANC! ANC!''
   Other whites, eyes cast down, walked quickly past the exuberant
blacks. The police, who broke up a peaceful demonstration in
central Cape Town on Wednesday, made no move to block the crowd
Friday.
   White reaction to President F.W. de Klerk's announcement of
sweeping reforms appeared subdued and uncertain. De Klerk legalized
the ANC and other outlawed anti-apartheid groups and called for
talks with blacks on ending South Africa's racial divisions.
   Andries Treurnicht, leader of the pro-apartheid Conservative
Party, called for a referendum on de Klerk's proposals.
   ``It was the most revolutionary speech to which I have listened
in this Parliament,'' said Treurnicht. ``He gave no indication
whatsoever in the (September) general election that he intends
making such sweeping announcements today. And we say he has no
mandate for doing the drastic things he intends doing and we
challenge him to call a general election.''
   De Klerk is unlikely to heed the call. He said after the
September voting that 70 percent of the white electorate supported
his plans to end apartheid and negotiate a new constitution with
blacks. De Klerk included the anti-apartheid Democratic Party
voters in his calculations.
   Democratic Party co-leader Zach de Beer said de Klerk's speech
was ``a great event. ... Of course the road ahead will be steep and
rough and there's a possibility of setbacks and problems. But taken
all in all I have more hope for South Africa at this moment than
I've had for 40 years.''
   Although de Klerk did not commit himself to ending white rule,
some whites expressed concern about their future in South Africa
after centuries of white domination.
   Some said they were afraid of being swamped by blacks in a mass
democracy or of being under black rule.
   ``As a South African I have reservations,'' said Michael Loor, a
white businessman. ``Whites are feeling a bit insecure. There is
reservation in the hearts of whites.''
   There was little talk about de Klerk's speech in several
fashionable restaurants, where the solidly white clientele, dressed
in business suits and chic dresses, chatted over long lunches. Some
people said they did not want to spoil lunch with talk about
politics.
   Shoppers and businessmen hurrying along the smart streets of the
city center appeared mostly unaware of the black crowds celebrating
on the nearby harbor front.
   A white police officer watching the black celebrations said he
was glad the state of emergency was being partly lifted. But he
expressed doubt about any future plans to share power with blacks.
   ``To my mind, blacks are good people, but there is a certain
element that doesn't want everything to flow freely,'' said the
officer, who declined to give his name.
   A businessman, who also did not want to be identified, said he
believed de Klerk was seeking a peaceful solution to ensure the
rights of all South Africans, and would guarantee the safety of
whites.
   ``De Klerk is a good man. He won't do the wrong thing for us,''
the man said.
   A few whites, mostly young students, mingled with the black
marchers, waving ANC banners and dancing and clapping. They
expressed hope that de Klerk and the white minority were serious
about radical change that would usher in democracy and end white
rule.
   But some expressed reservations, saying de Klerk had not spelled
out a commitment to ending white rule and had declined to reveal
the government's position on the future of South African government
and society.
   ``It's quite guarded (the speech) when you read it,'' said one
young man with a long blond pony tail before he was swept away in
the crowd.

<HEAD>Ex-Politburo Member Expelled from Party for Ethics Violation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Politburo member and hard-liner was
expelled from the Communist Party for using his influence to buy a
Mercedes-Benz at a great discount, official media said Friday.
   The harsh action against a conservative member of the party's
Central Committee comes just three days before the committee holds
a critical meeting that is expected to bring heated debate between
progressives and conservatives.
   The expulsion of Yuri Solovyov, who was a non-voting member of
the Politburo until his demotion last summer, must be confirmed by
the Central Committee when it meets Monday and Tuesday, said
Vladimir Kiryanov of the Leningrad party's press office.
   If his ouster is upheld, Solovyov will lose his pension and
numerous other privileges, Kiryanov said.
   It was the second attack this week on a prominent hard-line
Communist. The weekly Moscow News on Thursday attacked Politburo
member Yegor K. Ligachev and accused him of lying and clinging to
outdated socialist ideals.
   Solovyov, former Leningrad party chief, was retired last summer
during a meeting of the Leningrad party organization attended by
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Solovyov had been criticized for
resisting Gorbachev's reforms.
   Last spring, Solovyov suffered a humiliating defeat in the vote
for parliament, despite having no opposition, when more than 50
percent of the voters crossed his lone name off the ballot.
   Solovyov bought a ``luxurious Mercedes'' in December for ``a
practically symbolic price, even less than the cost of a new
(Soviet-made) Zhiguli,'' the government newspaper Izvestia
reported. He was expelled for violating party ethics because he did
not follow the rules on car purchases, Kiryanov said.
   Another reason he was kicked out was ``immodesty,'' Izvestia
said.
   The official news agency Tass implied that Solovyov abused his
position to obtain the vehicle, but Kiryanov refused to elaborate.
Top Communists have enjoyed special privileges such as foreign cars
and luxury food allotments for decades, but Gorbachev has pushed
for ``social fairness'' that has eliminated some privileges.
   Former Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev, who has been
discredited and blamed for economic stagnation and corruption, had
a great love of Western automobiles.
   Tass implied that others in the generally conservative Leningrad
party leadership might be threatened by the scandal. It said the
local prosecutor had been asked to investigate whether other
Communist leaders bought their cars illegally. Neither Tass nor
Kiryanov explained the precise violation.
   Izvestia specifically named former Leningrad Vice-Mayor G. Bukin
as another involved in the scandal, for acquiring an almost-new
Audi.
   Solovyov was expelled at an emergency meeting of the Leningrad
party committee on Thursday, the day after the sensational
Leningrad TV program ``600 Seconds'' broadcast a report showing
Solovyov's name on an auto registration list. Journalist Alexander
Nevzorov told viewers it had become easy to buy a Mercedes-Benz for
9,780 rubles.
   Rubles are worthless on the international market, so such a
statement implies the Soviet government took rubles from the buyers
and paid for the cars from its scarce store of foreign currency.
Nevzorov noted in the broadcast that 9,780 rubles is lower even
than the state price for a Soviet-made Volga, editor Alexander
Borisoglebsky confirmed Friday.
   Shortages require normal would-be buyers to wait years or pay a
vastly higher black-market price. Privileged people in the Soviet
Union, however, can skip to the head of the line.
   The 9,780 rubles are worth about $16,000 at the commercial
exchange rate and about one-tenth of that at the rate for tourists
and other individuals.
   Solovyov acquired a Mercedes 280-S, Borisoglebsky said. That
model was last produced in 1985 and cost about $23,000 without
taxes in West Germany.
   Solovyov, 64, is former construction engineer on the Leningrad
subway. He began full-time party work in 1974 as a secretary in the
Leningrad regional party committee. He became Leningrad party chief
in 1985 and a candidate member of the Politburo in 1986 _ during
Gorbachev's tenure as party chief.

<HEAD>Inmate Arraigned on Renewed Murder Charge in Car-Bombing of
Reporter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY LOPEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An inmate pleaded innocent Friday to a renewed
murder charge in the 1976 car-bomb slaying of an investigative
reporter for the Arizona Republic.
   James Robison, 67, of Chandler, was convicted of killing Don
Bolles in 1977, but the conviction was reversed on appeal. Robison
remained in prison on an unrelated conviction and was still there
when Attorney General Bob Corbin filed the new murder charge last
fall.
   Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Thomas O'Toole set trial
April 19.
   In addition to the murder charge, Corbin's office has been
working with a state grand jury investigating a possible conspiracy
to obstruct earlier investigations of the Bolles probe.
   The grand jury's work is secret, but there are indications that
Phoenix attorney Neal Roberts is a potential target. Roberts was
granted limited immunity early in the police investigation, but he
told The Phoenix Gazette this week he had brought his lawyer with
him to the latest grand jury probe.
   Under Arizona law, the only grand jury witnesses who can be
accompanied by lawyers are those the state designates as potential
targets of the grand jury.
   Roberts told police in 1976 that he had arranged a charter
flight and motel room for John Harvey Adamson, a greyhound breeder
and tow-truck operator who has acknowledged planting the fatal bomb
and has claimed that Robison triggered it by remote control.
   Roberts has said he had nothing to do with Bolles' death.
   Adamson testified at Robison's initial trial in return for
leniency. Robison and another man were convicted, but an appeals
court threw out the convictions because the defense wasn't allowed
to question a witness adequately. Adamson then demanded a better
deal before he would agree to testify at the new trial.
   Arguing that Adamson's refusal to testify again broke the plea
bargain, Corbin brought Adamson to trial and won a first-degree
murder conviction and a death sentence he hoped would persuade
Adamson to talk. Adamson's death sentence was thrown out by a
federal appeals court earlier this year.
   Corbin now says he has enough evidence to proceed against
Robison without Adamson's help.
   Bolles died June 13, 1976, 11 days after his car was blown up in
a hotel parking lot. A motive for the slaying has never been
established.

<HEAD>Baby Shamu to Leave Mom, Move to Ohio Sea World</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The original Baby Shamu, the first killer
whale born and raised successfully in captivity, will be taken away
from her mother this month to become the star of her own Sea World
show in Ohio.
   Florida's Department of Natural Resources has authorized the
separation and transfer from the Sea World marine park in Orlando _
the first time a captive killer whale has been intentionally
separated from its mother, state officials say. Federal wildlife
officials also agreed to the move.
   The company doesn't expect the move to affect either the mother
or her 5-year-old offspring, a Sea World spokesman said Thursday.
   ``We really anticipate no problems at all,'' said Nick
Gollatscheck.
   Researchers who study the marine mammals in the wild say they
live in pods or groups related on the mother's side. Many believe
killer whale offspring remain with their mothers throughout their
lifetime, but some biologists dispute this theory.
   Ed Asper, zoological director for the Orlando Sea World, said
the bonds between Baby Shamu and her mother, Katina, have weakened
because the mother has since had another offspring.
   In addition to Baby Shamu, now known by the stage name of Shamu,
the Florida park has five other killer whales.
   The Aurora, Ohio, Sea World now has two killer whales. One of
those animals will be moved to another of the Sea World parks, but
company officials would not say which one.
   Sea World applied for a state permit to move the whale last
month, and the agency conducted an investigation before granting a
transport permit.
   ``The primary concern was the condition of the facilities at Sea
World (in Ohio),'' said Charles Futch, an assistant director of
marine resources for DNR in Tallahassee.
   An inspection certificate signed Thursday by the Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service, a branch of the U.S. Agriculture
Department, concluded that killer whale tanks in Ohio met federal
standards.
   The DNR then approved the move to take place by Feb. 28.
   Shamu and two Pacific white-sided dolphins will be placed in
special stretchers and flown to the Aurora park, which will open
for the season around Memorial Day, officials said.

   African National Congress leaders
praised South Africa's decision Friday to legalize the guerrilla
group but said the government would remain a global outcast until
it ends apartheid.
   ``Victory is in sight,'' said ANC leader Walter Sisulu, although
he declined to describe the white-run government as committed to
ending racial segregation. ``They have made a progressive beginning
and, on the basis of that, I am hopeful that they will go farther.''
   President F.W. de Klerk said that he was legalizing the ANC,
lifting bans or restrictions on more than 60 other organizations
and freeing most people who had been jailed for joining them when
they were banned.
   De Klerk told Parliament in Cape Town that he was relaxing state
of emergency restrictions and would soon free jailed ANC leader
Nelson Mandela. He did not say when Mandela would be freed, saying
more time was needed to settle issues related to his safety.
   Sisulu praised the changes but said they were only preliminary.
Talks to end South Africa's decades of racial conflict could not
yet begin, he said, and sanctions against the government should
remain.
   An ANC statement said South Africa's main black nationalist
movement remained ``greatly concerned'' that some political
prisoners would not be freed, detentions without trial could
continue and some emergency regulations would remain.
   ``These decisions ... must be reviewed and changed without
delay,'' the ANC said.
   The statement said Mandela, who has served 27 years in jail for
plotting against white rule, should be freed immediately. It
rejected de Klerk's expressed concern for Mandela's personal
security outside of prison and said the ANC should share
responsibility for the 71-year-old leader's safety.
   Sisulu and other top ANC leaders were in Stockholm on a
Scandinavian tour, the first visit outside Africa for six elderly
ANC figures since their recent release from life sentences in South
Africa.
   The group visited ANC President Oliver Tambo, who is recovering
from a stroke in a Stockholm clinic, and sought to resume personal
contacts with Scandinavian governments, which have long been among
the ANC's strongest backers.
   An ANC spokesman said Secretary-General Alfred Nzo and Joe
Slovo, head of the South African Communist Party and former head of
the ANC's armed wing, were also expected in Sweden late Friday.
Their presence raised the possibility that an urgent review of the
South African situation, promised by the ANC as a result of de
Klerk's announcements, would begin over the weekend.
   In its statement, the ANC leadership said it would consult with
the Mass Democratic Movement, the main alliance of anti-apartheid
groups within South Africa, as well as other allies in the country.
   ``The review of the new situation will include an assessment of
the prospects of genuine negotiations to end the apartheid
system,'' the ANC said.
   It urged the world community, meanwhile, to do nothing ``to
lessen the isolation of the apartheid regime.''
   Although the ANC has conceded that its guerrilla operations
inside South Africa have had little effect, it has in the past
refused to abandon the armed struggle. Sisulu said that the
continuation of violence by the ANC ``will have to be discussed''
as part of its policy review.
   Asked whether negotiations with the government could begin,
Sisulu said, ``No. ... This is only the beginning.''
   He said the government should remove soldiers from black
townships in South Africa and should clarify the question of
whether political exiles, such as Tambo, were now free to return
home.
   Sisulu said he doubted de Klerk had placed himself at political
risk, despite opposition by the white Conservative Party to any
concessions to blacks. He said he believed that the conservative
movement has already ``reached the zenith of its power'' in South
Africa.

<TEXT>
   Illusionists Siegfried and Roy, who came here
20 years ago as bit players and remained to become one of the
city's top draws, have launched their long-awaited $20 million
entertainment spectacle.
   Some of the top names in the American theater share the credits
for the flashy show, which opened to a sellout audience Thursday
night at the new Mirage Hotel.
   ``This is a total feast for the senses,'' said producer Kenneth
Feld after the show. ``This elevates the level of entertainment in
Las Vegas to new heights.''
   The famed illusionists were one of the city's top entertainment
attractions before closing 19 months ago for a tour that included
performances in Japan and a stint at Radio City Music Hall in New
York City.
   They were signed by Mirage Hotel owner Steve Wynn to a
five-year, $57.5 million contract, and were scheduled to open Dec.
26. The show was delayed because of technical problems associated
with the complex production.
   ``It's like producing `Star Wars' and `Indiana Jones' live on
stage twice nightly,'' Feld said of production glitches that
delayed the opening.
   The show left even jaded Las Vegas show veterans somewhat agog.
One television reporter called the production ``the show of the
century.''
   The show's designer and co-director is John Napier, whose
credits include ``Cats,'' ``Les Miserables'' and ``Starlight
Express.''
   Singer Michael Jackson wrote some of the music for the
production.
   John Caird is writer and co-director for the show. Caird won
Tony awards for his role as co-director of ``Les Miserables'' and
``Nicholas Nickleby.''
   Andrew Bridge, who won a Tony for his work in ``Phantom of the
Opera,'' is the show's lighting director.
   Feld is producer of the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey
Circus and five Walt Disney ice spectaculars currently touring the
world.
   Wynn spent more than $25 million on the showroom, including a
giant stage and lighting facilities capable of showcasing Broadway
productions.
   Tickets run $55 in the 1,500-seat showroom, with two shows a
night, six nights a week, three weeks a month.
   ``We're bringing back to Las Vegas the magic that Las Vegas
deserves,'' Roy said after the show.
   ``We've combined the magic of the theater with the technology of
tomorrow,'' added Siegfried.
   The one hour, 45 minute show features spectacular staging, laser
technology, a 30-foot tall mechanical dragon, 54 dancers and a
dozen of the rare white tigers raised by Siegfried and Roy at their
Las Vegas home.
   The illusionists, natives of West Germany, are known around the
world for their efforts to breed the white tigers, which have
become extinct in the wild.
   The show opens with a flashy ``Star Wars'' scenario and
Siegfried and Roy arriving in their own mini space capsules.
Another segment has Roy sitting atop a 30-foot pyramid that is
destroyed by an explosion and fire, leaving him levitated high
above the stage.
   One of the most popular portions of the show is a simple film of
the duo's white tigers, shot when some of the 500-pound tigers
featured in the show were 25-pound cubs, romping about the
entertainers' desert compound.
   The show ends with the mother of several of the tigers, Sitarra,
and eight of her grown offspring on the set, as the song ``Bless
the Beasts and the Children'' plays.

<HEAD>January's Unemployment Rate Holds Steady at 5.3 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's unemployment rate held steady at
5.3 percent for an eighth straight month in January but the economy
still produced 275,000 new jobs, the government said Friday in a
report that analysts took as a refreshing sign of an economic
rebound.
   ``This shows the economy is strengthening. It's about as clear
an indication as we're going to get that the economy is not going
down,'' said Michael K. Evans, head of a private Washington
forecasting firm.
   ``It has to relieve some of the fears that we're headed for
recession,'' added economist David Wyss of DRI-McGraw Hill.
   Since last June, monthly unemployment rates as originally
reported by the Labor Department have fluctuated within a
percentage point of 5.3 percent. Those monthly figures later were
revised with updated seasonal adjustment factors, and each month
showed a 5.3 percent level, the agency said.
   Analysts said the steady jobless rate and better-than-expected
job growth was especially encouraging in light of the economy's 0.5
percent growth at the end of 1989, the poorest showing in more than
three years.
   They said Friday's report, the first comprehensive look at
economic activity in 1990, indicates the pace of economic
expansion, as measured by the gross national product, should
improve in the first three months of the year.
   In other good economic news, the Commerce Department said Friday
that orders to U.S. factories for manufactured goods shot up 1.9
percent in December to a seasonally adjusted $244.2 billion.
   Analysts said the sluggish manufacturing sector of the economy
might be perking up after durable goods orders jumped 4.8 percent
in November and 3.2 percent in December.
   The Labor Department said January's strong job growth figures
might be overstated because the warm weather last month, which
followed a bitter cold December, made it tough to seasonally adjust
job totals for construction and other industries affected by
weather.
   Delays in the reporting of post-Christmas layoffs in retail
trade also may have skewed the numbers.
   The manufacturing slump added to the overall slowdown in the
nation's economy last year, and that sector's lackluster
performance continued in January.
   Factory jobs dropped 112,000 last month, with 90,000 of the
losses suffered by the struggling auto industry. However, many of
those laid-off auto workers have been recalled since last month
when the Labor Department conducted its survey to gauge job growth,
the agency said.
   Still, it was the 10th straight month manufacturing jobs
declined. Yet analysts were impressed at the economy's ability to
absorb those losses without a hike in the jobless rate.
   ``The auto industry has taken a really big hit, but the rest of
the economy is marching along, and has virtually swallowed up the
manufacturing losses,'' said Robert Dederick, chief economist for
the Northern Trust Co. of Chicago.
   ``It certainly indicates that the economy is weathering the
storm. It has favorable implications for later on,'' Dederick said.
   Michigan has been particularly hard hit by the manufacturing
decline; the jobless rate there jumped to 8.4 percent in January,
up from 7.2 percent in December. That was the largest unemployment
increase in the 11 large industrial states surveyed by the
government.
   Construction employers reported a gain of 104,000 jobs during
last month's mild weather, following the 50,000-job loss during
December's harsh conditions.
   Meanwhile, the service-producing industries, which helped carry
the economy last year, continued to demonstrate healthy gains this
year. Those industries reported 284,000 new jobs, with 48,000 of
them created in health services.
   Other industries of the service sector posting large gains were
transportation, with 27,000 new jobs; wholesale trade, 24,00 new
jobs; and retail trade, 127,000. The last figure, though, is likely
overstated because of problems factoring in seasonal adjustments
after Christmas.
   Average hourly earnings, sometimes an advance warning of
inflationary pressures on the economy, were up just 0.1 percent in
January to $9.84.
   The government said that the civilian labor force, or the number
of people with jobs or those actively seeking employment, declined
by 149,000 last month to 124 million. The number of Americans with
jobs fell by 25,000 to 117.8 million.
   There were few major shifts in the jobless rate among major
demographic groups last month. The biggest change was among
Hispanics, where unemployment fell from 8.5 percent in December to
7.1 percent in January.
   In a separate calculation of unemployment that counts members of
the armed services stationed in the United States, the January
jobless rate was 5.2 percent, down from 5.3 percent in December.

``Rocky V.''
   Within about an hour Thursday, people had grabbed up 16,000 of
the 20,000 tickets for two days of filming in Stallone's latest
installment of the Rocky Balboa saga.
   Ten thousand people are needed for a boxing match audience each
day of filming, Feb. 8 and Feb. 9. Tickets went to people who had
vouchers that were given out in stores, restaurants and other
places.
   ``We want to be in the movies,'' said Doug Eagar, 18, of
suburban Upper Darby, who stood in line with his brother and three
friends.
   Dave Fulton, the film's publicist, has refused to say who would
fight in the scene. Rocky Balboa retires from the ring in ``Rocky

   Secretary of States James A. Baker III will
make an unprecedented appearance and answer questions before a
committee of the Supreme Soviet during a visit to the Soviet Union
next week, the State Department announced Friday.
   Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Baker will leave
Washington on Monday, stop in Prague en route to Moscow and hold
meetings in the Soviet capital on Wednesday through Saturday.
   The spokeswoman also said Baker will meet with French Foreign
Minister Roland Dumas during a refueling stop at Shannon Airport in
Ireland early Tuesday on the way to Prague.
   In Prague he will meet with Czechoslovakian President Vaclav
Havel and hold other meetings.
   On the way home, Baker will stop in Ottawa, Canada, to attend a
meeting Feb. 12-13 of NATO and Warsaw Pact officials to discuss an
``open skies'' proposal that would open U.S. and Soviet territory
to overflights.
   Ms. Tutwiler said Baker had no other stops planned, but said she
could not rule them out. There have been reports he might meet with
Egyptian Foreign Minister Esmat Abel-Meguid, and his Israeli
counterpart, Moshe Arens.
   ``Anything is possible,'' she said. ``We have nothing to
announce.''
   On arrival in Moscow on Wednesday, Baker will meet with Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze. He will meet with Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev on Friday.
   She said the secretary of state will make a brief opening
statement and then answer questions for 90 minutes in his
appearance before the 44-member International Affairs Committee of
the Supreme Soviet, the nation's chief legislative body, on Feb. 10.
   ``The Soviet legislature is ... likely to play an increasingly
important role in shaping Soviet foreign policy,'' the spokeswoman
said. ``Secretary Baker's meetings involve an excellent opportunity
to deepen our own undertanding of Soviet legislators most concerned
with foreign affairs, as well as answer their questions about U.S.
foreign policy.''
   Mrs. Tutwiler said it was the first time a U.S. official would
appear and answer questions in the Sovoiet equivalent of a
congressional hearing.
   ``This kind of meeting has not been done in the past,'' she
said. ``We are living in a time when a lot of things that haven't
been done before are being done, and this is one of them.''
   Ms. Tutwiler said current plans were to remain in the Soviet
Union on Saturday and fly to Ottawa on Sunday and return to
Washington on Tuesday or Wednesday.

   Black taxi-drivers honked
horns and stopped traffic, and workers whistled to celebrate
President F.W. de Klerk's announcement Friday of watershed
political changes.
   Blacks surged into in the streets in Cape Town, Durban and
Johannesburg at the news that the African National Congress and all
other organizations had been legalized and many national emergency
restrictions lifted.
   They streamed into the dusty roads of townships to cheer, and
marched through a Cape Town train station chanting, ``ANC! ANC!''
while police watched passively.
   ``We are probably seeing history in the making in South
Africa,'' said Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who could not stop
smiling during a news conference.
   ``We had expected that Mr. de Klerk might deliver something, but
what he said has certainly taken my breath away,'' Tutu said.
   Johannesburg whites stepped out of their shops to take
photographs and smiled as hundreds of blacks danced and marched
through downtown, waving banners and newspaper headlines that
declared: ``ANC Unbanned.''
   Drivers stopped their cars in the street, honking their horns
and punching their fists into their air, as black workers leaned
out of office windows, whistling and shouting.
   Police halted the march with a line of yellow patrol vehicles,
chased some protesters and fired tear gas to disperse others. No
injuries or arrests were reported, and many protesters laughed as
they ran from the police.
   In Cape Town, thousands of blacks banged placards against the
fence around Parliament, chanting ``ANC! ANC!'' before de Klerk
arrived to deliver his speech, which granted many of their demands.
   The announcement of the legalization of the ANC was picked up on
a car radio. The predominantly black crowd of 5,000 broke into
cheers, whistles and more chants as recently freed anti-apartheid
activist Popo Molefe relayed the news over a bullhorn from the back
of a truck.
   ``We would be unreasonable if we failed to acknowledge that of
all the presidents, of all the leaders of the Nationalist
government, that in fact de Klerk has taken the most bold step and
has emerged as the most courageous,'' Molefe said.
   ``Mr. de Klerk, in his speech, has moved rather swiftly to meet
most of the demands of the people,'' said the Rev. Allan Boesak,
the president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches. ``These
are clear, decisive steps that will undoubtedly, help to create a
better atmosphere here.''
   A black youth climbed atop a statue near Parliament of Jan
Smuts, a former South African prime minister, waving an ANC flag
and brandishing a wooden model of an AK-47 automatic rifle, the
symbol of the ANC's military wing.
   But police riot squads remained out of view and there were no
confrontations as the crowd marched joyfully through Cape Town's
streets.
   Scores of white policemen and white shopkeepers watched silently
from the sidewalks, some shaking their heads.
   Blacks and whites stood in groups with people reading the
afternoon newspaper, whose headline said, ``ANC Legalized.''
   After dark, thousands of blacks paraded through the townships
outside Cape Town, waving banners and singing hoarsely, while black
men, women and children came to the doors of their tents or
tin-roofed shanties to cheer.
   Street dancing broke out in downtown Durban as a group of black
railway union members marched through the city center to a
crescendo of cheers.

<TEXT>
   Federal President Janez Drnovsek
visited Kosovo province Friday and appealed for an end to violence
that has cost the lives of at least 21 ethnic Albanians in 10 days.
   He said the ethnic unrest threatens political and economic
reform in Yugoslavia, which is trying to transform itself from a
Communist nation to a Western-style democracy with a market economy.
   Riot police used tear gas to disperse about 200 demonstrators in
Pristina, capital of Kosovo, while Drnovsek met with provincial
officials.
   No other protests were reported Friday, but a virtual general
strike seemed to be in force. Kosovo, a southern province next to
Albania, is the nation's poorest region and 90 percent of its 1.9
million people are ethnic Albanians.
   ``Production has almost completely stopped,'' and even some
people who went to their jobs were refusing to work, the official
news agency Tanjug reported.
   At least 30,000 people in Kosovo have been on almost constant
strike since protests and riots began Jan. 24, according to
official statistics.
   Ethnic Albanians have demanded greater autonomy since Serbia,
the largest of Yugoslavia's six republics, made constitutional
changs a year ago that gave it almost total control of the
province. Kosovo is part of Serbia, but had functioned as an
autonomous region.
   Tanjug quoted Drnovsek as saying: ``I appeal to all peoples in
Kosovo, regardless of their nationalities, to stop violent
activities.''
   He said the situation was ``exceptionally grave and complex,''
and ``blocks the country's fundamental reforms.''
   The federal government has sent a sweeping political and
economic reform package to Parliament.
   When Drnovsek arrived in Pristina, he said: ``I have come with
some new ideas for solving the Kosovo problem.'' He would not give
details, and said he would discuss the proposals with provincial
authorities.
   Tanjug said a federal government commission consisting of
Premier Ante Markovic, the defense and interior ministers and four
other Cabinet ministers had been formed to ``monitor and control''
the Kosovo situation.
   ``Defense Minister Veljko Kadijevic is at his command post with
a group of generals,'' it said, without elaborating.
   Serbian authorities claim the constitutional changes were
necessary to protect minority Slavs in Kosovo. The republic's
conservative leaders have denounced proposals from two liberal
northern provinces, Slovenia and Croatia, that Kosovo be allowed
greater Freedom.
   About 10,000 Serbs held a rally Friday in a Pristina sports
arena to demand that the federal government ensure order.
   If it does not, the demonstrators said, they should be issued
weapons to defend themselves from ``attacks by separatists and
terrorists,'' terms used by Serbian officials to describe ethnic
Albanians who seek greater autonomy.
   Demonstrators carried portraits of Slobodan Milosevic, president
of Serbia, and chanted his name. Speakers claimed Slovenia and
Croatia were inciting unrest by claiming the rights of ethnic
Albanians were being violated.
   Three people were killed Thursday, including a young girl,
Pristina radio said. That brought the number killed since Jan. 24
to 21, by official count.
   More army tanks and armored personnal carriers arrived Friday
from the neighboring republic of Macedonia.
   Adm. Stane Brovet, deputy defense minister, told the federal
parliament Friday that ethnic Albanian ``nationalists have clearly
demonstrated they intend to secede from Yugoslavia in order to join
Albania,'' Tanjug reported.
   ``Their intentions must be thwarted by all means, including
force,'' and the armed forces are ``prepared at all times to defend
the country's integrity and its constitutional order,'' Brovet
declared.
   In contrast, an editorial in the Slovenian daily Delo said:
``There is no war in Kosovo. There are no mad terrorists, but only
powerless demonstrators ... whose every act is immediately
misinterpreted in the province's politicized atmosphere.''
   It said the demonstrators were victims of ``a planned policy of
repression, which wants to subjugate them by any means possible. .
.. Serbian policy in the province should be allowed to fail
completely.''

<HEAD>Liquor Consumption Drops Again</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Americans drank less liquor last year,
continuing a decade-long trend, and wine consumption dropped for
the third straight year, an industry group reported Friday.
   Changing lifestyles, concerns about health and publicity about
drunken driving and alcohol abuse contributed to the declines,
according to the Jobson Beverage Alcohol Group, which publishes an
annual survey.
   Consumption of distilled spirits dropped more than 2 percent in
1989, to 141 million cases. Liquor drinking peaked at 166 million
cases in 1979 and has dropped 15 percent in 10 years.
   Wine consumption fell 7 percent in 1989, largely because of the
decreasing popularity of wine coolers and a drop in table wine
consumption, the organization said.
   Wine coolers were down 19 percent, to about 40 million cases,
while table wine was down 4.3 percent, to 141.4 million cases.
   Sparkling wine was off 5.4 percent in 1989 and dessert wine was
off 1.2 percent, but vermouth was up 5 percent, possibly reflecting
an increase in the consumption of martinis, Jobson reported.
   The nation's liquor consumption worked out to 0.8 cases per
adult, down from 1.1 cases per adult in 1979. Per capita
consumption was at 0.6 cases, the lowest level since 1965.
   An average case of liquor contains 12 bottles and holds 2.7
gallons.
   Despite the overall drop, tequila was up 1.2 percent and Irish
whiskey was up 2.2 percent.
   The statistics are printed in Jobson's Handbook Advance, a
138-page report.

   Criminals have discovered the value of
computers and are using them ``in crimes of unprecedented economic
cost,'' the National Instiute of Justice said Friday.
   The institute cited a recent accounting firm study that
estimated $3 billion to $5 billion in thefts each year by high-tech
criminals.
   ``Increasingly, computers are being found in the illegal
activities of drug networks,'' said Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh. ``Drug traffickers use them to communicate with each
other, record their transactions and transfer and launder money.''
   The crimes include electronic funds transfer fraud and theft of
commercial inventories.
   The report mentioned a former insurance firm employee in Fort
Worth, Texas, who used a program to delete more than 160,000
records from the company's computer and also a prostitution ring
that had a data base of more than 80,000 clients, their credit card
numbers and sexual preferences.

   Punxsutawney Phil, the country's No. 1
four-footed forecaster, squinted hard but failed to see his shadow
Friday, thus predicting an early spring for only the 10th time in
more than a century.
   The squirming, 10-pound groundhog was pulled from his manmade
burrow atop Gobbler's Knob at 7:27 a.m. The crowd of about 1,500
screamed wildly after Phil's forecast was announced.
   ``He stood proud, tall and confident, surveyed the throng of
loyal followers, peered skyward toward the east and then fixed his
eyes groundward,'' said Edwin Snyder, 64, a county judge and a
member of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club's exclusive Inner Circle.
   ``He turned to Groundhog Club President Jim Means and signaled
to him in unmistakable groundhogese, `There is no shadow today,'''
Snyder said.
   Virtually everyone in the crowd of mostly students, some of whom
had waited in the light rain and mud for hours, seemed stunned by
the woodchuck's prediction. Even the tuxedo-clad members of the
Inner Circle, who decide well in advance what Phil predicts every
Groundhog Day, professed astonishment.
   ``I think he made a good pick,'' said Means, 66, who held Phil
to his ear then informed Snyder of the forecast so the judge could
announce it.
   John Groninger, 24, a college student from Fairbanks, Alaska,
who's traveling around the country, was thrilled with Phil's
prediction even though he doubts it will apply back home.
   ``It will be six more weeks of winter no matter what Phil
says,'' Groninger said, grinning.
   Tradition has it that if a groundhog sees his shadow at sunrise
on Feb. 2, there will be six more weeks of winter. If he doesn't,
spring is just around the corner.
   Phil has predicted an early spring just nine other times since
1887, when German-born farmers initiated the yearly event in this
small western Pennsylvania town. The favorable forecasts were in
1890, 1902, 1934, 1950, 1970, 1975, 1983, 1986 and 1988.
   The farmers borrowed from the legend of Candlemas, a Christian
feast celebrating the first time the infant Jesus was taken to the
temple. An old Scottish couplet claims, ``If Candlemas be fair,
there'll be two winters in the year.''
   As soon as his forecast was announced, Phil was whisked away
from the burrow and returned to his rest-of-the-year home at the
local library, a heated and air-conditioned hutch that he shares
with two other groundhogs, Philomena and Barney.
   Other prognosticating groundhogs around the country followed
Phil's lead.
   Octorara Orphie also saw no shadow in central Pennsylvania's
Quarryville. Neither did West Virginia's Concord Charlie as he was
``wandering around campus to see if any flowers are up,'' said Tom
Bone, public information director for Concord College in Athens.
   Ditto for French Creek Freddie at the French Creek Wildlife
Preserve in Upshur County in West Virginia and General Lee at the
Yellow River Game Ranch in Lilburn, Ga.
   Buckeye Chuck, Ohio's official groundhog, also failed to see his
shadow when he emerged from his burrow in a wooded lot next to the
studios of radio station WMRN in Marion.
   The newest addition to the groundhog lineup, Little Hog, made
his debut at the Indianapolis Zoo with fans joining in a rousing
chorus of ``You Are My Sunshine'' on kazoos. But there was no
sunshine and no shadow there.
   Phil's forecast isn't too far off the National Weather Service's
prediction for the next few months. Meteorologists expect February
to be warmer than usual in western Pennsylvania but colder than
usual in March and April.
   The Old Farmer's Almanac, on the other hand, is predicting an
extremely cold and snowy February around Punxsutawney.

   President Alan Garcia said today he will
attend a drug summit in Colombia on Feb. 15 now that President Bush
has promised to reduce the number of U.S. troops in Panama to their
pre-invasion levels.
   Soon after the United States invaded Panama on Dec. 20 and
toppled the regime of Manuel Antonio Noriega, Garcia and other
Latin American leaders protested to Washington. Garcia said at the
time that he would boycott the summit, probably sending a
government minister in his place.
   Garcia, Bush and the presidents of Colombia and Bolivia had
planned to coordinate their fight against drug trafficking at the
meeting in Cartagena.
   Earlier this week, President Bush said he would reduce the U.S.
military presence in Panama to its pre-invasion level of about
13,000 troops ``well before the end of February.'' He did not give
a specific date.
   At the peak of the U.S. intervention in Panama last month,
27,000 U.S. troops were there. Washington already has brought
11,000 home. Twenty-three American servicemen were killed in Panama
and more than 300 wounded. The civilian death toll is unclear, but
more than 200 are believed to have died.
   Before the invasion, about 13,000 U.S. troops were stationed in
Panama, where the U.S. Southern Command is located. A major
objective of the invasion was to bring Noriega to Florida to face
federal drug trafficking charges.
   Garcia said Bush's announcement caused him to reconsider his
decision to boycott the summit in Colombia.
   In a statement, he said will not only attend the meeting, but he
also will present a ``decisive and positive proposal'' to combat
drug trafficking.
   Presidents Virgilio Barco of Colombia and Jaime Paz Zamora of
Bolivia have already agreed to attend the summit, which will
discuss strategies to fight drug trafficking in the United States
and the three Andean nations.
   The Andean nations are the source of most of the world supply of
cocaine, the bulk of which is sold and consumed in the United
States.

<HEAD>Met Presents New Production of `Faust'</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs Planned</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gounod's ``Faust,'' once one of the world's most
popular operas but nowadays rarely heard, has been given a new
production at the Metropolitan Opera under the hand of Broadway
veteran Harold Prince.
   At Thursday night's premiere, the singing was beautiful, but
emotion was lacking.
   In fact, the most moving parts of the opera were the overture
conducted by Charles Dutoit and the final trio for Carol Vaness as
Marguerite, Neil Shicoff as Faust and James Morris as
Mephistopheles.
   All three were in splendid voice throughout the long evening.
Since the entire cast was singing in ``Faust'' for the first time
at the Met and the scenery and production were new, it is
understandable that digging into character and delivering emotion
is yet to come.
   ``Faust,'' presented on the Metropolitan Opera's opening night
in 1883, hadn't been heard there since the 1976-77 season.
   The scenery by Rolf Langenfass, who also did costumes, was on
the Met's turntable. Buildings looked as if made by a potter
creating a suggestion of buildings, then greatly enlarged.
Marguerite's house had a small doorway, a window and a few sloping
tiles indicating a roof. Depending on what was facing the audience,
the scenery could look like a ruin or beautifully other-worldly.
   The devil is often present in ``Faust.'' However, in this
production, the church and heaven are always represented. The
backdrop usually looked like stained-glass windows blurred because
seen from a distance. Sometimes the shape of a gothic church was
superimposed on this.
   In village square scenes, arches indicate the entrance to a
church. When this turned, the church's interior, with candles
banked before an altar, was seen.
   The decision not to include the Walpurgis Night ballet was wise.
Recent previous attempts have been long and silly.
   Prince, in his Met debut, has made some directorial decisions so
that this ``Faust'' is neither run-of-the-mill nor outrageous.
Sometimes Mephistopheles comes and goes in a flash of fire. His
first appearance, which often occurs that way, is more startling in
this production because the devil simply turns around in the chair
Faust had recently swiveled for his own entrance.
   Mephistopheles and Marthe (sung by Loretta Di Franco) do too
much horseplay during Faust's courtship of Marguerite, so that it's
too often interrupted by laughter. Other small details, such as
Marguerite's odd movements when Faust is early shown a vision of
her, could be praised or debated.
   Mezzo-soprano Delores Ziegler of Decatur, Ga., made her Met
debut. Her rich voice made a good impression as Siebel but and made
a listener look forward to hearing her in other roles.
   Brian Schexnayder, as Marguerite's brother Valentin, was showing
roughness and strain, especially on top notes, early in the opera.
Before the final act it was announced that a sinus infection which
he had thought cured had returned. He finished the opera.

<HEAD>Pilots Had Alcohol in Systems, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENSBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The pilot and co-pilot of a Federal
Aviation Administration plane that crashed in 1988, killing all
three crew members, were seen drinking the night before the
accident, according to a federal report.
   The National Transportation Safety Board report, released this
week in Washington, also said the co-pilot previously had lost his
driver's license for driving under the influence of alcohol.
   The board ruled the pilot's failure to reduce ice buildup caused
the twin-engine jet to crash in November 1988, 11{ miles from the
Westmoreland County Airport near Latrobe.
   The NTSB report said the pilot, James E. Burger, 64, of Linwood,
N.J., had a blood-alcohol level of 0.057 percent and the co-pilot,
Richard M. Wadsworth, 46, of Ocean City, N.J., had traces of
alcohol in his urine. Also killed was an FAA technician.
   Federal aviation rules bar pilots from flying civil aircraft
within eight hours after consumption of any alcoholic beverage,
while under the influence of alcohol or while having 0.04 percent
blood-alcohol content. The legal limit for driving in Pennsylvania
is 0.10 percent.
   The board concluded Burger's blood-alcohol content was due
partly to decomposition and fermenting of body fluids.
   Dr. Charles Winek, director of the Pittsburgh laboratory that
prepared a toxicology report on the bodies for the Westmoreland
County Coroner's Office, agreed Thursday that body fluids can
ferment during putrification, which can result in the production of
ethyl alcohol.
   ``However, this occurs in a hot, humid climate ... over a matter
of weeks,'' he told the Tribune-Review of Greensburg. ``This was
November. In wintertime it would take a lot longer than a matter of
a couple of hours to occur.''
   The men, based at the FAA Center in Pomona, N.J., were on a
routine inspection flight to test the radar landing-guidance system
at the Westmoreland County Airport.
   The NTSB said the aircraft's ice-detection system had been
operating only intermittently. Despite forecasts of icing
conditions in the area, the crew decided to complete their testing,
the NTBS said.
   ``Evidence indicated crew noticed ice accretion, activated
surface de-ice system, ice broke loose and entered engine intakes.
Both engines flames out,'' the report said.
   The agency said ice that entered the engine intakes damaged the
compressor assembly and blades.
   ``Both pilots had personal stresses which may have influenced
performance,'' the report said.
   The report said Burger had decided to retire that day and
Wadsworth recently had lost his driver's license.

<HEAD>Assets Turn Up in Abbie Hoffman's Estate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Abbie Hoffman, a 1960s activist who gave
away most of his earnings, had more assets when he committed
suicide last spring than previously believed, his attorney says.
   His estate is worth more than $37,000, according to tax papers
filed in Bucks County Courthouse in Doylestown, instead of the
$2,000 reported last fall.
   A large portion of that amount came from Hoffman's share of a
property in Massachusetts, which ``he never mentioned, never
used,'' Gerald Lefcourt of New York, Hoffman's attorney and friend
for 20 years, said Friday.
   Hoffman held 15 percent of the property, worth about $100,000,
which his father left to him, his brother, sister and mother,
Lefcourt said, and thus he could not give it away as he did most of
his wealth.
   ``He never owned a house, never took the proceeds from his books
and never bought anything for himself,'' Lefcourt said.
   Hoffman gave away hundreds of thousands of dollars to causes he
supported, according to Lefcourt, who said he watched in the early
1970s as Hoffman signed over to the Black Panther bail fund the
movie rights to his book ``Revolution For The Hell Of It.'' The
movie never was made.
   Lefcourt said about $5,000 in speaking fees that Hoffman never
collected also turned up in his estate. The rest of the money came
from a motorboat, a 1988 Hyundai Excel, a New York checking account
and a Bucks County checking account.
   Hoffman left his entire estate to Johanna Lawrenson, his
companion for 15 years.
   On April 12, at age 52, he committed suicide in his Solebury
Township apartment by taking an overdose of barbiturates mixed with
alcohol.

<TEXT>
   Skywatchers disappointed by Comets
Halley and Kahoutek are getting another chance _ newly discovered
Comet Austin, the brightest such object to approach Earth in 15
years.
   By mid-April, Coment Austin should be visible before dawn in
most parts of the planet, University of Florida astronomer Billy
Cooke said Friday.
   ``It won't be spectacular, but it will put on a better show than
Halley,'' he said. ``Austin looks pretty strong.''
   He estimated Austin will be twice as bright as Halley, making it
the brightest since Comet West in 1975. There are already
indications Austin could be a little brighter than now projected.
   ``Austin appears to be a very dirty and gassy comet, which gives
us cause for optimism because dirty and gassy comets tend to be
bright,'' Cooke said.
   Although it will be closest to Earth at a distance of 30 million
miles May 19, it will give its best view around April 14 just after
it swings around the sun.
   ``Floridians will get one of the clearest views because it will
be smack dab over our heads just before sunrise,'' Cooke said.
   Austin will appear to the unaided eye as a dim, fuzzy ball. The
tail, pointed away from the sun, will be visible through binoculars
or low-powered telescopes.
   Now visible only from the Southern Hemisphere, the comet will
come into view in the Northern Hemisphere in late March just after
sunset. Austin will disappear behind the sun during the first week
of April and reappear a week later, he said.
   Astronomers from University of Florida and other schools will be
heading to observatories around the world to study Austin.
   ``Comets are leftover material from the beginning of the
universe,'' Cooke said. ``We can get a view of how the early solar
system was formed.''
   The new comet was discovered Dec. 6 inside Jupiter's orbit by
Rodney R.D. Austin, an amateur astronomer.
   Like most comets, Austin probably originated in the Oort Cloud,
far beyond the outermost planet of Pluto, Cooke said.
   ``For some reason it's been flung into our part of the solar
system,'' the astronomer said. ``It'll probably keep coming back
every hundred thousand years or so now.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady on Friday
tried to ease the Bush administration away from its recent calls
for lower interest rates, saying such comments were really aimed at
the slumping home-building industry.
   Brady told Congress' Joint Economic Committee that a statement
made two weeks ago by White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater urging
lower interest rates was not meant to pressure the Federal Reserve
Board.
   He said Fitzwater's remarks were meant merely as a prelude to a
visit President Bush paid the next day to a homebuilders'
convention in Atlanta.
   ``Presidents generally talk about lower interest rates at
housing conferences,'' Brady said.
   Brady's remarks came just four days before Fed policymakers were
scheduled to hold a closed-door session in Washington to set
monetary targets for the rest of the year.
   Fed officials are sensitive about appearing to respond to
prodding from the White House for fear that the financial markets
will lose confidence in the central bank's independence.
   Talking with reporters on Jan. 18, Fitzwater said a recent prime
rate reduction by banks had not been passed through to the general
economy.
   ``It's important occasionally to point out that lower interest
rates are normally good for the economy,'' Fitzwater said at the
time.
   The White House spokesman went on to cite Commerce Department
statistics showing a drop in housing starts as evidence that lower
interest rates were needed.
   The next day, Bush told the National Association of Homebuilders
that he wanted interest rates to drop further.
   ``The 1990s must be another decade of lower taxes and lower
interest rates,'' Bush said.
   The White House usually does not comment publicly on Federal
Reserve policy. Asked by committee Chairman Lee Hamilton, D-Ind.,
whether Fitzwater's comments were inappropriate, Brady said, ``Not
in light of what I understand was the reason for the statement
being given.''
   Brady conceded that at his weekly meetings with Fed Chairman
Alan Greenspan, the two men have ``vigorous discussions'' in which
they frequently disagree.
   ``The administration probably has a bias toward growth that's
greater than that of the Fed,'' Brady said. ``At the same time, we
keep a weather eye on inflation.''
   The Treasury secretary also indicated that although he was not
satisfied with the current annual inflation rate of 4.6 percent, he
looked favorably on the lack of dramatic fluctuation in the cost of
living.
   ``Stability is something to be sought after,'' he said.

   President Bush, citing ``tremendous
problems'' from overseas competition, today announced he is
creating a panel of science advisers to search for ways to make the
United States more competitive in science and technology.
   Bush vowed to engage in tough negotiations to try to knock down
foreign trade barriers. ``I think we can compete, I believe that.
But we can't do it if we're up against closed markets and if we're
up against trade restrictions,'' the president said.
   Speaking at a roundtable discussion on high-tech issues at North
Carolina State University, the president said, ``We've just got to
find ways to free up as much as possible our commerce.''
   ``I am optimistic about the country. I know we've got tremendous
problems with competition, but we're getting our focus on it now,''
Bush said.
   ``We're moving into a whole new decade with a whole new focus,''
he said.
   The business leaders told Bush that to keep abreast of foreign
competition in their industry they wouild like to see more emphasis
on education, particularly math and science at all levels.
   Bush summoned the newly-formed panel, to be headed by White
House science adviser Allan Bromley, to the presidential retreat at
Camp David, Md., for a kickoff meeting on Saturday. The panel,
which will have between 10 and 14 members, will be called the
president's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology.
   The president traveled to Raleigh and to Knoxville, Tenn., to
promote educational goals he outlined in his State of the Union
address earlier this week _ goals already under attack from critics
who contend Bush doesn't back up his promises with enough money.
   ``Look, I came here to learn and listen,'' Bush said. He called
himself ``fired up'' on the subject of improving U.S.
competitiveness.
   Bush was focusing today on enhancing research and development
activities for which he has proposed $71 billion in his fiscal-year
1991 budget. The sum represents an increase of $4.5 billion over
the money enacted for 1990, according to White House figures.
   At the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, Bush called on
Congress to implement his proposals quickly.
   ``Building America's competitive strength today...means that we
need quick congressional action on our other proposals for
investing new capital _ intellectual capital. That includes
everything from reforming product liability laws to doubling the
budget of the National Science Foundation,'' Bush said.
   ``Some wonder if America has lost its competitive edge and ask
if we must now look overseas for the answer,'' he said. ``The
United States is the defending world champion. But we have to
defend our title day by day, week by week, year in and year out.''
   Bush told reporters flying with him this morning that his goal
is ``to make the United States more competitive around the world
... We must not lose our prominence in science and technology.''
   Bush toured the Surface Science Laboratory at North Carolina
State University, where students and professors explained their
work in studying semiconductor surfaces. After they showed him an
elaborate system of equipment and electronic gadgetry, Bush
commented, ``All this brain work out here. It's a little awesome.''
   Laboratory supervisor Dr. Robert Nemanich said the program
receives $250,000 in federal funds and that within his field many
scientists ``would like to see an increase in support in these
areas. We see in our leadership in technology eroding'' in
comparison with foreign competition, he told reporters.
   The new 15-member advisory panel will advise Bush ``on matters
involving all areas of science and technology.''
   Its members, the White House said, will be the director of the
Office of Science and Technology Policy and 14 members from the
private sector.
   The president's action came a day after more than 700
scientists, including 49 winners of the Nobel Prize, accused Bush
of being complacent about the threat of global warming and urging
him to show greater leadership on the issue.
   The scientists, representing more than one-third of all members
of the National Academy of Sciences, said in a letter to Bush, that
action ``must be initiated immediately. Only by taking action now
can we ensure that future generations will not be put at risk.''
   Critics on Thursday also attacked the president's education
budget for being insufficient to achieve his goal of ``excellence
in education.''
   The president came under attack from Democrats and education
groups almost as soon as he announced the goals for improvement in
students' math and science achievement, literacy and drug-free
schools.
   ``There is a yawning gap between the rhetoric of President
Bush's education speeches and the funding levels he offers in his
budget,'' said Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation
of Teachers.

<HEAD>Bad Omen: `Number of the Beast' Dropped From License Plates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCUS ELIASON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities have dropped the number 666 from car
license plates after some motorists complained that the Biblical
number of the beast had bedeviled their lives, causing everything
from fender benders to bad water.
   ``It's not that we as an organization give any credence to this,
but we don't want to be inadvertently causing real distress to
people,'' Jeff Mumford, senior executive officer of the policy
branch of the government Driving, Vehicle and Licensing Center,
said Friday.
   The belief that 666 represents Satan comes from chapter 13,
verse 18 of the New Testament Book of Revelation, which refers to
``the number of the beast; for it is the number of a man; and his
number is six hundred threescore and six.''
   Among those who shun the number is Ronald Reagan, who changed
his California address from 666 to 668 St. Cloud Drive after
leaving the White House.
   Complaints also arose in Tennessee in 1988 over the number when
the state began using new three-digit tags. The Davidson County
clerk withdrew all 366 license plates from the county stockpile
bearing the number 666 when motorists refused to accept the plates
and said they bore the mark of the devil.
   A man from North Wales claimed that within one week his house
was burglarized, a garbage truck backed into his car and he was
told his water supply was poisoned, Mumford said. The man blamed
his troubles on the 666 in his number plate.
   ``Then there was a lady who claimed the car actually took hold
of her and she couldn't control it. It reversed, mounted the
doorstep and squashed her son's scooter. She said she stopped it
only in time to prevent it crashing into the kitchen.''
   He also cited the case of a mother of a convicted murderer who
said her son had been ``a quiet, home-loving boy'' until his job
required him to drive a van with 666 in the license plate.
   A recent television report featured a man who said he lost his
family, home and business after buying a car with 666 in its
license plate.
   The traffic center decided to stop issuing new plates containing
666 four months ago, but is not withdrawing the thousands already
in circulation, Mumford said in a telephone interview from the
center's headquarters in Swansea, Wales.
   ``If you were to convince us that the presence of the number is
causing you distress we would consider it sympathetically,'' he
added.
   Mumford said that because of the practicalities and the
implications for law enforcement, ``We are very reluctant to change
number plates on vehicles.''
   Also, he said, one would assume that ``if you are so religious
and superstitious you wouldn't have bought the vehicle in the first
place.''
   British license plates have a sequence of three letters, three
digits and an additional letter. These signify the year the car was
produced and the region where it was sold.
   Some combinations are already excluded, including MAD, GOD and
SEX.

<HEAD>Savage Has Criticism of Colleagues Deleted from Record</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Gus Savage on Friday deleted from the
Congressional Record personal criticism of three House members
whose complaint led to his investigation by the chamber's ethics
committee.
   On Thursday, Savage took the floor to announce that the
committee had ended its investigation of him and to call the
allegations against him a ``racist attack'' by the news media and
government officials.
   Savage, an Illinois Democrat, did not mention in the speech that
the committee had concluded that his ``sexual advances'' to a Peace
Corps volunteer during a trip to Zaire last March ``were contrary''
to a House rule requiring members' conduct to ``reflect
creditably'' on the chamber.
   The report, obtained Thursday by the AP, said the committee
would have directed Savage to apologize to the women had he not
already done so.
   In Thursday's speech, Savage, who is black, attacked the
movitations of the three white lawmakers who had complained to the
ethics panel _ Reps. Patricia Schroeder of Colorado, Matthew McHugh
of New York and Barney Frank of Massachusetts. All are Democrats.
   Savage noted in the speech that the three lawmakers had filed
their complaint ``despite admitting that they knew absolutely
nothing about the case other than allegations in a Washington Post
newspaper story'' last year that detailed the woman's account of
the incident.
   A tape of his speech shows that Savage then said, in remarks
deleted from the record:
   ``And believe it or not, among these self-appointed guardians of
personal morality was one who since has admitted keeping and
prostituting a homosexual. As for the other two so-called liberals,
I urge them to review their sensitivity to racism and respect for
fairness.''
   The ethics committee is investigating Frank, who has
acknowledged paying a male prostitute for sex but has denied other
allegations of improper conduct made by the prostitute.
   Savage's spokesman, Donnovan Dunkley, was not immediately
available for comment. None of the three representatives Savage
criticized would comment after his speech.
   Only a member can revise his remarks in the official record. A
House staff source, speaking only on the condition of anonymity,
said, ``A member of the House floor staff suggested that he
(Savage) remove those remarks from the record and he agreed to
that.''
   The proceedings of a House or Senate session are printed the
next day in the Congressional Record, which is the official
transcript of proceedings but is not always an accurate reflection
of what was said on the floor. The discrepancy occurs whenever a
member exercises his right to ``revise and extend'' his remarks in
the printed record.

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. ambassador to NATO said Friday
the East German premier's proposal that a reunited Germany be
neutral was both premature and unrealistic.
   ``The right thing to do is to wait until (East Germany) has had
elections and has a democratically elected government in place, and
take up the subject at that time,'' William H. Taft IV said in an
interview in his office at alliance headquarters.
   He said Premier Hans Modrow's proposal ``is certainly a novel
one, coming from a leader of what is still a non-democratically
elected government.''
   Taft, a former deputy defense secretary, said a unified Germany
within NATO ``is a much better idea in terms of contributing to the
stability and security of Europe and of Germany for that matter.''
   East Germany belongs to the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany has
suggested a reunified Germany remain part of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization, but with only the territory of West Germany be
tied to its military structure.
   Taft said Genscher's proposal ``answers the basic requirement
for stability in Europe, which is that (West Germany) should be
aligned with the West.''
   The Genscher plan recognizes that West Germany's links to NATO
and the European Community have been ``crucial for Germany's
security and prosperity over the years, and it would continue
that,'' he said.
   It would be ``a very big mistake'' for Germany to leave the
Western military alliance, Taft said, and ``I don't understand that
this is at all contemplated by the government'' in Bonn.
   ``Germany's security, Germany's prosperity, Germany's freedom
have been won and protected and grown ... within NATO (and) the
EC,'' the U.S. ambassador said. ``I really don't sense any desire
to give that up.''
   Taft said he believed President Bush's proposal for further deep
cuts in Soviet and American troops strengths in Europe would help
advance the negotiations on conventional arms being conducted in
Vienna.
   In his State of the Union message Wednesday night, Bush
suggested a ceiling of 195,000 soldiers each for the United States
and Soviet Union in Central Europe. The United States would have
30,000 more in Britain and southern Europe.
   Last May, Bush proposed an overall limit of 275,000 each. The
Soviet Union has an estimated 565,000 troops stationed in Europe
outside its national territory, and the United States has 305,000
in Western Europe.
   Taft said political changes in Eastern Europe ``suggested that
the levels we had arrived at in May could be reduced,'' and that
proposal ``was becoming one that needed some change'' at the Vienna
talks.
   Czechoslovakia and Hungary have asked the Kremlin for quick
withdrawal of the estimated 120,000 Red Army soldiers still on
their soil.
   ``We anticipate that the difficulties that the Soviets have had
in finding the welcome mat for their troops in Eastern Europe will
certainly result in substantial reductions,'' Taft said. ``It may
well result in reductions below 195,000.''
   He said the American plan would be submitted to a special NATO
panel Monday for approval, then be proposed soon in Vienna.
   Bargainers for the 16 NATO nations and the seven in the Warsaw
Pact hope for agreement this year on reducing the number of battle
tanks, artillery, armored troop carriers, combat aircraft,
helicopters and soldiers in Europe.

<DATELINE>SALEM, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The long-lost text of a sermon delivered 271
years ago by Puritan leader Cotton Mather has been rediscovered,
offering a more complex portrait of the man best known for his role
in the Salem witch trials.
   ``Because of Mather's standing as one of the most learned and
most influential of the Puritan people, a find of this nature is
very significant,'' said Richard Fyffe, who identified the
document. He is chief librarian of the Essex Institute, which
collects, preserves and studies the history of Essex County.
   Although historians and bibliographers knew Mather gave a
stirring funeral sermon from newspaper accounts, letters and other
sources, they had searched in vain for decades for a full text of
Mather's remarks.
   Mather read the sermon on Nov. 9, 1718, at the funeral of George
Worthylake, his wife Ann, and their daughter, Ruth.
   Worthylake, keeper of Boston's first lighthouse on Little
Brewster Island, was drowned with his wife and daughter when their
boat capsized in a fierce storm. Worthylake's two other children
witnessed the accident from the shore.
   ``Tho they were now so very near the shoar, yet the winds and
the seas, were so high they could not fetch it, before they were
all of them unhappily drowned,'' Mather wrote. ``There were two or
three children with a kinswoman, who with inexpressible horror and
anguish, beheld the deadly distress of their parents and sister,
and others thus perishing in the waters; unable to give the least
help unto them.''
   ``Imagine if thou canst, the agony,'' he urged in the sermon.
   ``The dead bodies of their parents and sister and others being
thrown upon the land, were the only company which these poor
children had upon the desolate island; for two whole days and
nights together.''
   Mather's eulogy pointed to the Puritan ethic that tragedies are
a part of God's will, but Fyffe noted that Mather's sympathy for
the children and the horror expressed at the accident were
characteristics not normally associated with Puritan expression.
   ``It is not surprising that we have caricatured the Puritans as
a hard, unemotional people, but they were not as unfeeling and
unsympathetic as we seem to believe they were,'' said Fyffe.
``Mather's sermon is an example of this.''
   Fyffe found the sermon, ``Providence Asserted and Adored,'' last
year as he was cataloguing the Essex Institute's collection for a
nationwide computer database of all early American printed material
made before 1801.
   In the course of the work, Fyffe came across the pamphlet, which
had never been properly identified because it was missing a cover.
A former librarian had placed a note with the document suggesting
it might be written by Mather, but apparently never followed up on
it. Fyffe did.
   The pamphlet is now at the institute in Salem, a seaside city
about 20 miles north of downtown Boston.
   Mather, who lived from 1663 to 1728, was considered a leading
theological and scientific expert of his time. He published nearly
400 documents, ranging from fiery sermons to scientific
examinations.
   However, he is probably best known for his role in support of
the Salem witch trials of 1692, during which 20 people were
executed.
   Fyffe said the finding is important because Mather has long been
considered both an intellectual and spiritual genius, and the
pamphlet could change an image tainted by the witch trials.
   ``If this contributes to the public's developing a more complex
sense of who Cotton Mather was, then it is important,'' Fyffe said.
``Cotton was not the ideal man in any means but he was a more
sympathetic man than we tend to give him credit for being.''

   Sidney Barthelemy, New Orleans' second black
mayor, is expected to add another election to his unbroken string
Saturday against a white challenger who has accused him of
race-baiting.
   ``I do expect the voting returns to fall along racial lines,''
said Silas Lee, Barthelemy's pollster.
   About 54.4 percent of New Orleans' 237,342 registered voters are
black and 44.4 percent white, with Asians making up the rest.
   Barthelemy, 47, and Donald Mintz, 46, a lawyer who formerly
headed the city's dock board, spent Friday shaking hands and making
personal appearances.
   Early polls put Mintz ahead of Barthelemy. But in recent polls,
Barthelemy, who was a state senator and city councilman before
becoming mayor and has never lost an election, has drawn ahead by
10 to 12 percentage points.
   The four-month campaign created little interest, upstaged by
parties for the year-end holidays, the Sugar Bowl and the Super
Bowl. Even the issue of race, which sparked the candidates' two
televised debates, did little to enliven the campaign.
   Mintz, who wears a lapel button showing white and black hands
interlinked, claimed Barthelemy's ads on a black radio station
appealed to anti-white racism.
   Barthelemy said it was Mintz who interjected the issue of race.
   ``Mintz didn't want Sidney to highlight what he did for black
business and the black community on black radio,'' Lee said. ``No
other candidate has said that was race-baiting.
   ``And in the past, other candidates haven't said `By
highlighting what you've done for one group or constituency, that
is race baiting or sex baiting or any other type of baiting.'''
   Another racial issue arose when anonymous fliers depicted
Barthelemy as an opportunistic Uncle Tom.
   Barthelemy accused Mintz of distributing the fliers, but Mintz
vehemently denied it.
   The campaign's other issues have been high crime, low
employment, and the candidates' political experience and competence.
   But until his death on Dec. 23, most of the interest was focused
on former Mayor Ernest Dutch Morial, the city's first black mayor.
   ``The whole campaign for the past year, literally, was dominated
by Dutch Morial,'' said Ed Renwick, director of Loyola University's
Institute of Politics and pollster for Mintz.
   Until Morial announced Dec. 14 that he wouldn't run, ``the basic
question was would he run or wouldn't he run,'' said Renwick. ``And
from then until his death, it was why didn't he run and would he
endorse Mintz?''
   ``I would say you still have a lot of voters showing little or
no interest,'' said Lee. ``... Usually you have a passionate
electorate when you have a candidate who is disliked by a
substantial number of voters. You don't have that here. People get
passionate when there's somebody they want out of office.''
   But Registrar Louis Keller said 55 to 60 percent of the voters
are expected to turn out for the election, which also includes
races for five City Council seats and nine other city offices.
   Herman J. ``Buster'' Bustamente and black businessman Rudy E.
Mills Sr. are also in the race for mayor but expected to draw few
votes.
   If no candidate gets more than half the vote, a runoff will be
held March 3.

<HEAD>Former Oglala Sioux Tribal Chairman Dead at 55</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RAPID CITY, S.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard Wilson, who was chairman of the
Oglala Sioux Tribe during the 1973 American Indian Movement
occupation of Wounded Knee, has died. He was 55.
   Wilson, who had been hospitalized in Rapid City, died Thursday
of complications from an enlarged heart and kidney failure,
according to his brother, Jim Wilson.
   He was the only Oglala Sioux tribal chairman to serve two
consecutive terms, holding office from 1972 to 1976.
   It was ironic that Wilson died the same day Gov. George
Mickelson and tribal leaders from across the state signed a
document naming 1990 a year of reconciliation between Indians and
whites, long-time friend Tim Giago of Rapid City said Friday.
   That's something Wilson strived for all his life, said Giago,
publisher of the Lakota Times, an Indian newspaper.
   Wilson, who disagreed publicly with the militant tactics of AIM,
was labeled a ``goon'' by the AIM activists who occupied Wounded
Knee. Controversy erupted because it was Wilson's sworn duty to
uphold reservation laws, ``and the laws were being broken,'' Giago
said.
   Wilson was treated unfairly because the national media told the
Wounded Knee story from AIM's viewpoint, he said.
   ``They (AIM) had the ear and the eye of the press, of the
national media that flocked out here. Unfortunately, Dick was never
very good at working and dealing with the press,'' according to
Giago.
   ``After AIM left ... and after all their leaders went off to
other places in the world, Dick Wilson stayed on that reservation
and helped clean up the mess that was left there.''
   Wilson urged Indians to get involved in tribal and state
government. He helped set up the first Indian housing authority on
the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation.
   Giago said he went to the hospital Thursday and talked to Wilson
before he died.
   ``He told me that he just couldn't continue anymore, that his
heart was broken,'' Giago said
   His eldest son, Billy B. Wilson, 35, was killed a week ago in a
vehicle-pedestrian accident in Dallas, ``and I guess the stress of
that just broke him up completely,'' Giago said.
   Wilson, a contractor and plumber, served as a tribal council
member for six years before being elected chairman of the tribe. He
lived on a ranch north of Pine Ridge.
   He had been attempting a political comeback and was a candidate
for tribal chairman again in the primary Feb. 13.
   In addition to his brother, Wilson is survived by his wife,
Mary, and several children.

   Richard Dortch, once Jim
Bakker's top deputy at the PTL ministry, arrived Friday at the
federal prison camp on this base to begin serving an eight-year
sentence for fraud and conspiracy.
   Dortch, 58, pleaded guilty in August, days before he and Bakker
were to go on trial in Charlotte, N.C.
   Under a plea bargain, Dortch testified against Bakker at his
former boss' trial. He also appeared in December before a grand
jury that later indicted the Rev. Sam Johnson, a former PTL
executive, for perjury.
   Bakker is serving a 45-year sentence in a federal prison in
Minnesota.
   Dortch will be eligible for parole after serving about 2{ years.
He also was fined $200,000. U.S. District Judge Robert Potter has
yet to hear a motion from Dortch's lawyers for a reduction in his
sentence.
   Dortch will be in an admission and orientation program for about
two weeks before he is assigned a job at the camp or elsewhere on
the base about 40 miles east of Pensacola, said warden Willie Scott.
   Dortch is the lastest on a long list of celeberity inmates who
have served time at the unfenced, minimum-security camp.
   Others have included Watergate figure E. Howard Hunt, fashion
magnates Aldo Gucci and Albert Nipon and former baseball pitcher
LaMarr Hoyt. Politicians and judges also have been Eglin inmates,
including former U.S. Rep. Richard Kelly, R-Fla., who was convicted
in the Abscam scandal, and former Maryland Gov. Marvin Mandel.
   Most of the 800 or so inmates on the 28-acre compound are
white-collar criminals and low-level drug dealers.
   The camp has been derided by critics as a ``country club''
prison and nicknamed ``Club Fed.''
   Two Air Force sergeants recently pleaded guilty to accepting or
agreeing to accept bribes to take an inmate to nearby motel for a
rendezvous with his wife.
   Prison officials dispute the country club image.
   ``These are non-violent people from a variety of backgrounds;
not all of them are big shots by any means,'' Scott told The
Associated Press last year. ``Most of them are serving short
sentences. And, since they aren't dangerous and we are located on a
military base, we don't even need to have a fence around the
place.''
   In addition to housekeeping jobs at the camp, prisoners work
throughout the base, primarily doing landscaping, Scott said.
   Eglin is the nation's largest air base, covering 720 square
miles.

   Iran-Contra prosecutors are pursuing
allegations that former CIA operative Thomas G. Clines failed to
report income on his tax returns from arms transactions involving
the Contras, according to sources familiar with the probe.
   A key witness in the investigation of Clines, according to the
sources, is Albert Hakim, who was placed on two years' probation
and fined $5,000 Thursday for his role in the Iran-Contra affair.
   Hakim and business partner Richard Secord set up ``the
Enterprise,'' the network of offshore companies used to handle
money in the secret supply operation to the Contras and the Reagan
administration's sales of arms to Iran.
   At the request of his friend Secord, Clines helped procure arms
for the Contra rebels starting in 1985. In addition to locating a
European arms dealer as a source of weapons, Clines helped arrange
for shipping and lined up crews to transport the supplies to the
rebels. Some $972,728 in commissions were set aside for Clines in
the account of an entity code-named C. Tea, according to the
congressional Iran-Contra report issued in November 1987.
   In testimony to Congress in 1987 _ given under immunity from
prosecution based on his words _ Hakim identified C. Tea as the
code name for Clines. Hakim didn't begin supplying Iran-Contra
prosecutors with information on the matter until he entered a plea
agreement with the government Nov. 21.
   In court papers, the government said Hakim has ``indicated his
willingness'' to give testimony ``in an anticipated future case''
and is cooperating in a grand jury investigation outside
Washington. The papers did not elaborate, but the sources,
commenting only on condition they not be named, said the subject of
the investigation is Clines.
   A longtime attorney for Clines, John Ellsworth Stein, declined
comment Friday.
   But other sources familiar with the situation say that Clines
did in fact report money from the transactions on his tax returns.
   Clines takes the position that he has reported all his income,
the sources added.
   Mary Belcher, a spokeswoman for the Iran-Contra prosecutor's
office, declined to comment.
   The office of independent counsel Lawrence Walsh, which began
operating in December 1986, focused on Clines early in its
investigation but was unable to assemble a case, the sources said.
   Clines worked for the CIA for 30 years. He was an agent in
Southeast Asia, was involved in the Bay of Pigs invasion in Cuba
and became director of training in the directorate of operations,
also known as the clandestine services.
   He also became a close associate of Edwin Wilson, the former CIA
agent who is serving 52 years in federal prison for illegally
selling guns and explosives to Libya.
   Clines pleaded guilty in 1984 on behalf of his wholly owned
company to inflating bills submitted to the Defense Department for
shipping U.S. military equipment to Egypt. He was fined the maximum
$10,000 and paid the government $100,000 on behalf of his firm,
Systems Services International.

<HEAD>US Asks Angola To Stop Attack on Rebels, Seeks Soviet Cooperation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The United States on Friday urged the Angolan
government to stop its offensive against the U.S.-armed UNITA
rebels, and said it had sought Soviet cooperation to end the
fighting.
   Gains by Soviet-armed government forces have brought them to the
edge of UNITA-controlled territory in southeastern Angola.
   A military source in Lisbon said Friday the Angolan army had
captured the strategic UNITA airstrip of Mavinga after a fierce
battle that included air strikes, but a UNITA spokesman in Lisbon
denied it.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said she could
not confirm the fall of Mavinga to the government, but that a large
force of troops had crossed the Lombo River and were within 10
miles of Mavinga. That information was based on independent
confirmation, officials said.
   Mavinga is considered a key to military control of the region
and vital to any government plans to attack the rebel stronghold at
Jamba, 120 miles farther south.
   The offensive by the Soviet-backed government began in late
December, apparently in an attempt to capture more territory as a
bargaining chip in peace talks with UNITA, the Union for the Total
Independence of Angola.
   Efforts by the United States, the Soviet Union and Portugal to
revive the peace talks that began last June have stalled.
   The offensive ``will make it increasingly difficult to reach the
negotiated settlement necessary to conclude this tragic conflict,''
Tutwiler said. ``We urge Luanda to halt its military offensive, and
to devote its efforts to finding a negotiated solution.
   ``The United States stands willing to assist the parties and the
mediator in the search for peace,'' she said.
   Assistant Secretary of State Herman Cohen discussed this at
meetngs in the Angolan capital of Luanda 10 days ago.
   The United States has spoken to Soviet officials about the
latest offensive several times, Mrs. Tutwiler said. ``The Soviets
have restated their commitment to a negotiated settlement of the
Angolan conflict and their belief that there are no military
solutions.''
   But Soviet military aid to Angola's government ``continues at
high levels, and Soviet military advisers remain in Angola,'' she
said. The United States gives UNITA, headed by Jonas Savimbi, at
least $40 million in weapons every year. It has vowed to continue
arming the group until peace is achieved.
   However, Soviet military advisers have pulled back from the
forward fighting area in southeastern Angola since mid-January,
Mrs. Tutwiler added. There also were no signs of Cubans involved in
the offensive.
   Cuban troops, estimated to number 50,000 at the peak of their
presence in Angola, have been ahead of a scheduled 1991 pullout
agreed to last year as part of a complex peace package that also
brought independence to the former South African colony of Namibia.

<HEAD>INS to Allow Some Immigrants' Families to Stay</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of illegal aliens who are children
or spouses of legal immigrants will be allowed to stay in this
country under a policy announced Friday by Immigration Commissioner
Gene McNary.
   Under McNary's order, those aliens will be given permission to
stay if they were in this country on Nov. 1, 1986, the day the
Immigration Reform and Control Act took effect.
   Officials estimated that more than 100,000 people might be
affected by the new policy.
   The policy previously enforced by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service allowed family members who are illegal
aliens to stay only if there was a ``compelling humanitarian
reason'' against deportation.
   McNary said that standard was too ``nebulous'' and resulted in a
policy that ``has not been evenly and uniformly enforced throughout
the country.''
   Some INS district directors were too strict and others too
lenient in applying the standard, he told reporters. Only a handful
of people were deported under the old policy, he said.
   But McNary said a more consistent policy may encourage more
people to apply for the new status, which would allow them to
obtain work permits.
   While the INS will strictly enforce immigration laws to deter
illegal border crossings,``we can enforce the law humanely,''
McNary said.
   ``To split families simply encourages further violation of the
law as they (illegal aliens) attempt to reunite,'' McNary said.
   The law granted blanket amnesty to illegal aliens who could
prove they were residing in the country before Jan. 1, 1982. It
also provided immigrant status to undocumented farm workers who
could prove they had worked 90 days picking crops in this country
in any one of three years.
   More than 3 million illegal aliens have been given legal status
under the amnesty program in the 1986 law. Of those, more than 1
million have applied for permanent residency.
   The spouses and children covered by the order typically followed
their relatives to this country but did not arrive in time to
qualify for amnesty. These people technically remain illegal aliens.
   The decision was lauded by representatives of immigrant-rights
groups but was also termed belated because it was made long after
the legalization program ended. Illegal aliens had until May 1988,
to apply for permanent residency status under the amnesty program.
   ``It's just a shame that it has taken such a long time to
ameliorate some of the harsh and restrictive elements that had been
used in the legalization program,'' said Arthur C. Helton, head of
the asylum project of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights.
   Many eligible aliens didn't apply for permanent residency
because they feared relatives who entered illegally would be caught
and deported, Helton said.
   Arnoldo Torres, national political director of the League of
United Latin American Citizens who has been harshly critical of the
agency, called the order ``probably one of the most reasonable
positions that INS has taken.''
   The cases of those given permission to stay will be reviewed
annually to determine if the aliens had committed crimes or had
become dependent on welfare assistance. Aliens could be deported if
they committed crimes or if the INS found they had become ``public
charges,'' McNary said.
   The new policy was criticized by the Federation for American
Immigration Reform as ``just plain illegal.''

   State Rep. Jesse White has spent more than 30
years helping inner-city youths who live in some of the toughest
neighborhoods somersault their way past gangs and into a better way
of life.
   Since its creation in 1959, the Jesse White Tumbling Team has
been featured at professional sports games, in a book and a movie.
   White, 55, said he designed the team to combat juvenile
delinquency _ a frequent hazard for his tumblers, most of whom live
in the crime-ridden Cabrini-Green housing project.
   ``My kids know that as long as they're part of the tumbling
team, they're safe in the community,'' White said Thursday of his
75 varsity tumblers, who range in age from 6 to 26.
   ``We're looked upon as baseball heroes or movie stars ...,''
said White, a legislator for 14 years.
   Eighteen-year-old James Hogg, a team member for the last eight
years, said joining the squad kept him out of trouble.
   ``The team taught me not to settle for less in life,'' said Hogg.
   The tumblers perform a dizzying array of stunts. Members flip
over obstacles, do double twists and double backward flips. For the
finale, members bounce off a mini-trampoline over as many as 25
other teammates.
   The team, which depends largely on corporate sponsors for
financial support, has visited Japan and performed at professional
sporting events in Chicago and across the country. This year they
plan to visit China and Korea.
   The tumblers were featured in the movie ``Ferris Bueller's Day
Off'' and a book, ``I Am a Jesse White Tumbler,'' which tells the
story of a boy who joined the team when he was 5.
   White said tumblers are prohibited from joining gangs.
   ``It's simple,'' said White. ``If you're with them, we don't
need you. I have a waiting list of 3,600 kids for this program. If
you want to be part of the gangbangers, go.''
   White said tumblers have often told him that they'd rather be in
trouble with the police than with him. He described an incident
four years ago with a tumbler who for the third, and final, time
had violated team rules.
   ``He slapped another member of the team ... and I said that I
have to dismiss you. He said, `Please Mr. White don't take this
away from me. This is all that I have ... you can take off my arms,
take off my legs, pluck out my eyes, but please don't put me off
the team,''' said White.
   In addition to the 75 varsity tumblers, there are 10 girls in
his dance troupe and 550 would-be varsity members are tutored each
week.
   White said his schedule is busy, but that he doesn't mind
because he remembers what people did for him as a youngster.
   ``Often when we reach great heights in life, we forget who
brought us there. Well, I have not,'' he said.
   For some, being a team member is a dream come true.
   ``The team is like a family to me,'' said 16-year-old Cornell
Wallace, who joined the team 5{ years ago.
   ``It shows people that we're trying to get something going for
ourselves in the future,'' said Wallace, whose 18-year-old brother
was killed by gang members last year.
   ``I really enjoy the respect that I get from the team and the
respect that others give me _ on the streets in particular,'' Hoff
said. ``It makes me feel proud ... like I'm achieving something.''

<HEAD>Bush Budget Calls for More Money for European Weapons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is seeking more than
$18 billion in fiscal 1991 defense spending for major weapons
targeting Warsaw Pact forces despite the political upheaval in
Eastern Europe, a congressional agency reported Friday.
   Congress' bipartisan Arms Control and Foreign Policy Caucus said
President Bush's new budget calls for an increase of more than $1
billion from the fiscal 1990 budget for the weapons.
   The chairman of the caucus, Rep. Howard L. Berman, D-Calif.,
said that while he applauded Bush's call for reduced troop levels
in Europe, ``the budget for weapons should reflect the new era too.
We shouldn't pour billions into new weapons systems designed to
counter Warsaw Pact forces that no longer exist.''
   In his State of the Union address, Bush proposed a reduction of
U.S. and Soviet combat troops in Europe to 225,000 on each side in
response to the tumultuous changes in the Eastern bloc where
democracies have emerged from the rubble of communist regimes.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, in testimony before the Senate
Armed Services Committee on Thursday, said the Soviet Union is
likely to withdraw all it troops from Eastern Europe by the middle
of the decade.
   The caucus lists 25 major nuclear and conventional weapons
systems which in the past the Pentagon has justified as primarily
for use in Europe. According to the report, if the administration
continues these programs, the cost will total about $70 billion
over a three-year period beginning in fiscal 1992. Bush is seeking
$292.1 billion in defense spending in fiscal 1991.
   Among the budget requests are an increase of $64 million for the
SRAM-T, or tactical short-range attack missile; a jump of $80
million in spending for the short-range missile, or follow-on to
the Lance; and $235 million more for the Tomahawk land-attach
nuclear cruise missile.
   The proposed spending plan also includes slightly more than $1
billion for the Advanced Tactical Fighter, $2.7 billion for the
C-17 transport aircraft and $3 billion for the F-16 fighter plane.
   ``Our weapons policy should match our threat assessment,''
Berman said in releasing the caucus report. ``Obviously not every
weapon on this list should be canceled. But given the last six
months, both Congress and the executive branch have a duty to
re-evaluate the assumptions behind these weapons before we write
the check for them.''
   The caucus is composed of 140 members of Congress. The
organization's staff and the Congressional Research Service of the
Library of Congress compiled the list of weapons.

   Democratic Party chairman Ronald H. Brown said
Friday that while he sees ``hopeful signs'' of progress in South
Africa, it is too early to consider lifting U.S. economic sanctions.
   ``I think we ought to keep the pressure on South Africa as long
as it takes,'' said Brown.
   The Democratic Party leader commented shortly after President
Bush said he would review U.S. sanctions in the light of the
announcement by South African President F.W. de Klerk that he was
legalizing the opposition African National Congress and would soon
free its imprisoned leader, Nelson Mandela.
   ``I think when people move in the right direction, it is
certainly time to review all policy,'' Bush said.
   ``Let's see what happens,'' Brown said when asked about the
possibility of lifting U.S. sanctions against the apartheid
government. ``Let's see what happens with Mandela.
   ``There are certainly some hopeful signs and we all ought to be
pleased with those signs. I don't know that we ought to be
recommending any abrupt changes.''
   The U.S. sanctions include a ban on importing South African
steel, textiles, uranium, coal and agricultural produce. They also
bar new U.S. investment in South Africa, forbid new bank loans and
end U.S. landing rights for South African Airways.
   Brown also said that when he was in Israel last week, Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir assured him that Israel would disclose
within the next several weeks a timetable for terminating its
military contracts with South Africa.
   South Africa is Israel's largest military trading partner.

<TEXT>
   The Communist Party purged its ranks of
the old guard Friday and handed leadership to a moderate reformer
who promised to pursue democratic reforms.
   Alexander Lilov, a veteran Communist who fell from favor in the
old Stalinist regime, said he would overhaul the party before it
competes in Bulgaria's free elections set for May.
   Lilov replaces Petar Mladenov, who will remain as state
president. Bowing to demands of reformers, Mladenov had proposed
separating the posts of Communist Party chief and head of state.
   The changes in the party were the latest since Mladenov replaced
Todor Zhivkov, the hard-line Communist leader whose 35-year rule
was ended on Nov. 10.
   Lilov said it is not possible for the party to avoid reform
``because the situation in the country and the party has changed.''
   Lilov was elected during a 24-hour secret session that closed a
four-day emergency party congress.
   The Central Committee was replaced by a 153-member Supreme
Council that is less than half the size of its predecessor but
contains a much broader political spectrum, including radical
pro-reform factions.
   Ninety percent of the Central Committee members failed to win
election to the council that replaces it, party sources said.
   The delegates also created a 51-member commission on party
ethics and a 31-member Central Finance Commission.
   Zhivkov, 78, has been arrested on charges of abuse of office and
inciting ethnic hostility during his rule. Bulgarian state radio
reported Friday that Zhivkov's health was so bad he could not
remain in prison and was moved to a hospital.
   The radio did not describe Zhivkov's illness nor say when he was
hospitalized.
   Among those not on the new Supreme Council is Premier Georgi
Atanassov, who resigned Thursday with his 22-member cabinet after
coming under sharp criticism during the congress for failing to
solve Bulgaria's economic woes.
   The resignation was necessary ``to form a Cabinet on a broad
national basis,'' said the state news agency BTA.
   The communists have made a vague proposal for a government of
``national concord'' to rule until the May elections. Lilov
announced that talks on the new government would begin Saturday
with opposition groups.
   But Lyubomir Pavlov, a senior official from the opposition Union
of Democratic Forces, said the opposition is unlikely to take part
in a provisional government.
   He said the opposition would have little clout since Communists
control 67 percent of Parliament.
   Compared with their East bloc neighbors, Bulgarian communists
have given up relatively little power, bolstered by a century of
roots in the nation's politics and a relatively weak, though
growing, opposition.
   But after his unanimous election by the Supreme Council, Lilov,
56, told the delegates the party is at a critical juncture.
   ``We really had to try to elect a leadership ... which will work
not only in difficult conditions but will lead the party to victory
in elections,'' he said.
   A philologist by training who was the Politburo ideologist
through the 1970s but absent from the leadership from 1983 to 1989,
Lilov told the congress Wednesday ``we are lagging behind.''
   He acknowledged the party suffers from a ``a lack of
confidence,'' and said, ``while the party and the country are in a
crisis, we have not reached the climax yet.''
   The Supreme Council also elected Mladenov, Lilov and two other
top party figures _ Andrei Lukanov and popular Defense Minister
Dobri Dzhurov _ to a presidium that will essentially replace the
Politburo under the new party structure.
   By far the most urgent task of the new leadership will be
restructuring the economy, which many congress delegates said is in
disarray.
   The economic problems felled Atanassov, a holdover from the
Zhivkov era, who had come under fire for failing to curb
unprecedented labor unrest and making concessions to striking
miners.
   A Bulgarian official said French experts had been called in to
work out a program of unspecified economic reforms.

   Orders to factories for manufactured goods
slowed to a 6.4 percent increase in 1989, the government said
Friday, but analysts said manufacturing should revive slowly this
year.
   ``If you take the figures at face value, except for some
industries like autos, the worst is over,'' said Gordon Richards,
director of economic policy at the National Association of
Manufacturers.
   John Hagens, an economist with the WEFA group in Bala Cynwyd,
Pa., had a similar assessment, saying that while much of the
economy continues to grow slowly, it's ``not on the verge of a
recession.''
   The Commerce Department said orders for both durable and
non-durable manufactured goods gained 1.9 percent to a seasonally
adjusted $244.2 billion in December after rising 2.4 percent in
November.
   The increase put orders for the year at $2.83 trillion after a
9.7 percent increase in 1988, which was the largest advance since
1983. Orders had declined 1 percent in 1986.
   Durable goods orders, held back during much of the year by the
Federal Reserve's high-interest policies, slowed to a 5.9 percent
gain in 1989, following advances of 11 percent in 1988 and 7.6
percent in 1987.
   But in the key category of non-defense capital goods, a
barometer of business investment plans, orders rose 18 percent in
December to $45.9 billion after an 8.1 percent hike in November.
   Evelina Tainer, senior domestic economist at First National Bank
of Chicago, said non-defense capital goods orders fell about 16
percent during the third quarter, pointing to the weakness in the
manufacturing sector.
   But they rose 7 percent at an annual rate in the
October-December period, which she said ``shows the manufacturing
sector was bottoming out in the fourth quarter and there's a little
revival there.''
   Michael K. Evans, head of Evans Economics Inc., a Washington
forecasting firm, noted that in another report Friday the Labor
Department said 116,000 factory jobs were lost in January, 90,000
of them in the automobile industry. But, Evans added, many of the
autoworkers have returned to work.
   ``It's the end of the manufacturing slump,'' he said.
   For December, durable goods orders were up 3.2 percent to a
seasonally adjusted $134.4 billion after rising 4.8 percent in
November. Most of the increase was in transportation, which
increased 11.2 percent to $40.9 billion. Excluding transportation,
orders would have risen only 0.2 percent.
   Electrical machinery increased 5 percent to $22.7 billion,
offsetting a 4.7 percent decline in non-electrical machinery to
$21.6 billion. Primary metals orders were down 3.8 percent to $10.8
billion.
   Non-durable goods orders increased 0.3 percent in December to
$109.9 billion, with most of the increase in petroleum products.
Non-durable orders had fallen 0.2 percent in November after a 0.6
percent gain in October.
   The often-volatile defense orders were down 11.6 percent to
$9.96 billion after rising 17.7 percent a month earlier. Excluding
defense, orders would have advanced 2.5 percent.
   The Commerce Department also said shipments of manufactured
goods fell 0.5 percent in December to $231.8 billion, while
inventories dropped 0.4 percent to $371.5 billion. It was the first
decline in inventories since last September and the largest since
they dropped 0.4 percent in September 1986.
   If inventories increase without a corresonding gain in new
orders, it could signal production cutbacks as factories attempt to
get rid of goods on shelves and in back lots.

<HEAD>President to Attend Drug Summit After U.S. Assurances on Panama</HEAD>

   President Alan Garcia said Friday he will
attend the Feb. 15 drug summit with President Bush in Colombia,
reversing his earlier decision to boycott the meeting if U.S.
troops were still in Panama.
   Garcia said he decided to go to the meeting after Bush announced
his intention to withdraw by the end of the month troops sent to
Panama to remove Gen. Antonio Manuel Noriega from power.
   Presidents Virgilio Barco of Colombia and Jaime Paz Zamora of
Bolivia are also set to attend the summit, which is to take place
in Cartagena, Colombia.
   They are to discuss strategies to fight drug trafficking in
their respective countries. The three Andean nations are the source
of most of the world supply of cocaine, most of which is sold in
the United States.
   Garcia cited the ``gravity of the drug problem'' and said he
will go with a ``decisive and positive proposal'' to combat
trafficking.
   Bolivia and Peru produce 90 percent of the world's coca leaf.
Most of Peru's coca harvest is transformed into paste and shipped
to Colombia, where it is refined into cocaine.
   Bolivian traffickers formerly did the the same but increasingly
are producing refined cocaine and smuggling it directly to the
United States and Europe, according to U.S. drug officials.
   The drug trade brings billions of dollars in clandestine
revenues into the three countries each year.
   Bush last year proposed spending $2.2 billion over the next five
years to fight the drug trade in the three Andean nations.
   Among the topics the four presidents are expected to discuss are
military and police aid to fight smugglers and leftist guerrillas
tied to drug trafficking, crop eradication and substitution
programs, cooperation in stopping the laundering of drug money, and
the extradition of drug suspects.
   Garcia had pulled out of the meeting after U.S. troops landed in
Panama Dec. 20 to topple Noriega, saying, ``I cannot meet with the
leader of an invading nation.'' Peru had planned to send a
high-level delegation to the summit even if Garcia did not go.
   On Jan. 7, Garcia said he would attend the summit if U.S. troops
were first withdrawn. In announcing his decision to go, Garcia said
Friday he trusted Bush's promise to withdraw the troops by the end
of February.
   ``This removes one of the obstacles in the way of my
attendance,'' Garcia told reporters at the Government Palace.
   ``I have no reason to doubt the announcement he made before
Congress.''
   Bush said Wednesday in his State of the Union address that all
``additional troops'' sent to Panama would be withdrawn by the end
of the month.
   About 27,000 U.S. troops were in Panama during the invasion.
About 13,000 troops had been stationed at U.S. bases there before
the invasion, and the same number are to remain after the February
pullout.
   Garcia has been highly critical of the U.S. actions in Panama,
and charged the United States intended to break the Panama Canal
treaties of 1977, which call for the United States to cede control
of the Panama Canal at the end of the century.
   Garcia also recalled his ambassador in Washington and suspended
for one week joint anti-drug operations with U.S. drug agents and
Peruvian police in protest.

<TEXT>
   Gen. Michel Aoun sent tanks against his
rival's seaside command post Friday, the fourth day of a battle for
Christian supremacy that has killed more than 120 people and
wounded 500, most of them civilians.
   Police said a half-million people were trapped in basements and
bomb shelters of Christian east Beirut without electricity, food or
water after a cease-fire Thursday afternoon failed to hold. Each
side accused the other of breaking it.
   Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir, the Maronite Catholic spiritual
leader, appealed to Aoun and his adversary Samir Geagea, both
Maronites: ``Stop shooting. ... Have mercy on the people. Their
lives and property are not yours. You must stop this massacre now.
You must stop this mass suicide.''
   A statement from the International Committee of the Red Cross
said it was ``alarmed by the intensity of the clashes'' and
requested a ``humanitarian cease-fire quickly to permit the
evacuation of casualties.''
   Geagea said his Lebanese Forces militiamen ``crushed the
repeated advance attempts'' by two columns of Aoun's tanks trying
to converge on his command post behind howitzer fire of 20 shells a
minute.
   Geagea's television station later said his militiamen overran
the Amsheet base of Aoun's 7th brigade on the northern edge of the
enclave. It broadcast a film showing 7th brigade commander Brig.
Gen. Sami Rehana surrendering to the Lebanese Forces at the base.
   In east Beirut, shells hit high-rise apartment buildings, fuel
depots, hospitals and filling stations, sparking fires that raged
out of control. Police said snipers kept fire engines from battling
the blazes.
   One salvo at 10 p.m. set the city's main power plant on fire.
   Mohieddin Mmehio, acting head of the state-run electricity
authority, pleaded in an appeal broadcast by all Beirut radio
stations for a 6-hour neutralization of the Sad el-Boushrieh
industrial area to allow firefighters to put down the blaze.
   ``Otherwise Beirut will be without power for months to come,''
he warned.
   The capital has already been without power since the fighting
erupted Tuesday. That was attributed to the inability of
electricity authority employees to report to work at the main
generating plant in the embattled Zouk suburb because of the
hostilities.
   Tongues of orange-red flames pierced the dark sky and clouds of
black smoke hung over the city as shelling duels raged into the
night.
   Patriarch Sfeir appealed to the combatants after presiding over
a meeting of senior Maronite clerics at his hilltop seat in Bkirki,
north of Beirut.
   Four howitzer shells landed in the area while they met. Geagea's
radio and television stations blamed the shelling on Aoun.
   Voice of the Nation, a Moslem radio, said Aoun's men fired
shells that fell in west Beirut. The Moslem sector has not been
involved in the war between the rebel general and Geagea, who
commands Lebanon's main Christian militia.
   Police said seven people were killed and 40 wounded in west
Beirut and President Elias Hrawi, who lives and works there, was
forced to move to a secret hideout.
   They said at least five 120mm mortar rounds landed near Hrawi's
residence in the Ramlet al-Baida district. An aide, reached by
telephone, said the president ``changed his office for his own
safety.''
   Voice of Lebanon radio, a Christian station owned by allies of
Geagea, proclaimed: ``Beirut is burning!''
   Geagea's Lebanese Forces issued a statement saying Aoun ``has
shown himself unscrupulous in satisfying his lust for power, even
if it means apocalypse for everyone.''
   Hrawi dismissed Aoun as army commander, but he has refused to
step aside or turn over the presidential palace in suburban Baabda,
where a bunker serves as his headquarters. He commands about 20,000
men and Geagea has about 6,000, bolstered by several thousand
reservists.
   It was difficult to determine Friday who was getting the upper
hand. Aoun appeared determined to destroy the Lebanese Forces, but
repeated assaults have failed to reach Geagea's main arms and
ammunition depot in the Ashrafiyeh district of east Beirut.
   Control in the 310-square-mile Christian enclave is about evenly
split between Aoun and Geagea.
   In a three-minute televised address Friday, Aoun urged
Christians to ``rally behind your army.'' He said the Lebanese
Forces would enforce a peace agreement mediated by the Arab League
last fall, which he rejects.
   Hrawi was elected by Parliament to carry out the peace plan in
an attempt to end Lebanon's 15-year-old civil war, which has cost
more than 150,000 lives.

<HEAD>Gotti's Alleged Victim Testifies for Defense</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A union official who was allegedly shot on
reputed mob boss John Gotti's orders testified for the defense
Friday in Gotti's assault trial, saying he couldn't identify the
people who nearly killed him.
   John O'Connor, former vice president of Carpenters' Union Local
608, had refused to testify for the prosecution. But under
questioning by defense lawyer Gerald Shargel, he detailed the
shooting of May 7, 1986.
   O'Connor, 56, said he noticed four or five men hanging around
outside his union local's offices when he arrived there about 6:45
that morning.
   While waiting for the elevator, O'Connor said he heard ``a
thunderous clap'' and felt something in his body, although he did
not realize he had been shot.
   A man shouted, ``Mr. O'Connor, Mr. O'Connor,'' and the union
official said he turned and saw a man pointing a gun at him.
   The elevator arrived, and O'Connor said he got on as the gunman
fired more bullets into his buttocks.
   The union official said he got off the elevator at the seventh
floor, saw an acquaintance and said: ``Please help me, I've been
shot, several times.''
   Jose Corvalan, the surgeon who treated O'Connor at the hospital,
said the victim would have died without prompt medical treatment.
   O'Connor said that in viewing police photos he was never able to
identifiy any of the men he saw outside his office the day he was
shot.
   Gotti, 49, the reputed Gambino crime family head who's noted for
his snappy attire, and Anthony Guerrieri, 60, an alleged Gambino
soldier, are on trial in Manhattan's state Supreme Court on charges
of assault and conspiracy in the O'Connor shooting.
   Prosecutors say Gotti had O'Connor shot for leading union goons
to wreck Bankers and Brokers, a Gambino-affiliated restaurant.
   They maintain that a secretly recorded tape shows Gotti saying
O'Connor needed to be ``busted up.''
   Arguing the tapes are largely inaudible, the defense said that
if the comment was clear enough to prosecute Gotti, it was clear
enough for authorities to warn O'Connor.
   The defense, which rested Friday, argued that O'Connor's enemies
in his union might have shot him because of internecine rivalries.
O'Connor said he initially told police that union trouble had
nothing to do with the incident, but conceded in testimony that
within the union, ``We were having problems.''
   Under cross-examination, O'Connor answered questions about the
attack on him and about the 127-count indictment charging him with
perjury, extortion, and labor racketeering.
   But he asserted his Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination when asked about his alleged links to organized
crime and about his ownership of certain properties.
   Testimony suggested that O'Connor's union was tied to the
Genovese gang.
   O'Connor took the stand after acting Justice Edward McLaughlin
denied a defense motion to dismiss the case, or to instruct the
jury that in an earlier trial the prosecution had presented a
different theory about the Bankers and Brokers incident.
   Gotti's lawyer, Bruce Cutler, said he thought it was significant
that O'Connor had refused to testify against Gotti for the
prosecution and that the defense had subpoenaed him.
   McLaughlin said the jury will hear closing arguments Monday and
will get his final instructions Tuesday.

<HEAD>Four Top Aides of Romanian Dictator Ceasescu Draw Life Terms</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Romania</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A military tribunal convicted four top
officials under ousted Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu of
being accomplices to genocide and sentenced then to life in prison
Friday, Radio Bucharest reported.
   They were convicted of backing Ceasescu's orders to shoot
demonstrators during the violent December revolution that toppled
him after 24 years.
   Ceausescu and his wife Elena were executed by firing squad on
Dec. 25.
   The five-judge tribunal, the first to try leading figures in the
Ceausescu government, rejected a prosecution demand that the four
men be convicted of the more serious crime of ``co-authorship to
genocide.''
   Both charges are punishable by a maximum sentence of life in
prison, but the minimum terms are different, lawyers said.
   The panel ordered seizure of all property belonging to the four,
including gold, jewels and large sums of money, and stripped them
of their civil rights.
   The four, who had already pleaded guilty to the charge of
``complicity to genocide,'' stood solemnly as the tribunal
president, Col. Andrei Nitoiu, announced the majority verdict after
two hours of deliberation.
   Three of the four defendants _ Emil Bobu, 62, former secretary
of the Communist Party Central Committee and No. 3 in the Ceausescu
leadership; former state council Vice President Manea Manescu, 74,
and former Politburo member Ion Dinca, 62 _ stared at the judges,
showing no emotion as the verdict was read.
   Former Interior Minister Tudor Postelnicu, 59, bowed his head,
as he had during much of the five-day trial.
   The National Salvation Front, which took power during the
revolution, abolished the death penalty, making life in prison the
maximum penalty.
   Bobu, Postelnicu and Manescu said they would appeal but Dinca
told the judge he would not. Manescu, while saying he was guilty,
had asked for a lesser sentence than the others, saying he had no
part in repressing demonstrators.
   The four Politburo members admitted they backed Ceausescu's
orders to shoot scores of demonstrators and did nothing to end his
dictatorship. But all denied they gave direct orders to put down
the protests.
   The military prosecutor, Col. Aurel Cosma, urged the judges to
imprison all four for life ``on behalf of the thousands of victims,
of orphans, children, men, women and brave military men who were
killed'' in the revolution.
   Western diplomats have said up to 10,000 people died in the
fighting between Ceausescu's Securitate forces and citizens who
joined with the army.
   Ceausescu and his politically powerful wife fled Bucharest by
helicopter on Dec. 22, but were arrested, convicted of genocide and
of ruining Romania's economy in a secret summary trial, and were
executed.
   The prosecution charged the four defendants could have prevented
the genocide that killed at least 689 people and injured 1,281 by
asking Ceausescu to resign. But instead they backed his order to
shoot the demonstrators.
   The prosecutor asked for the stiffer charge of ``co-authorship
to genocide'' Thursday, saying a colleague drafted the charges
incorrectly.
   Both charges are punishable by a maximum sentence of life in
prison, but the minimum terms are different, lawyers said.

   Flowers and bloodstains marked a sidewalk Friday
where a 14-year-old robbery suspect became the second unarmed
teen-ager in five days to be killed by a police officer.
   ``Killer cop Albergo,'' was spray-painted in black on a blue
badge on a wall near the scene. Scrawled in black on the sidewalk
where Jose Louis Lebron died were the words ``Killed by a man in
blue.''
   Lebron died Wednesday in front of the Wilson Avenue Candy Store
in the Brooklyn neighborhood known as Bushwick. He was shot behind
the right ear by Officer Frank Albergo, who thought he saw Lebron
reaching into his jacket for a weapon. A preliminary investigation
showed Albergo acted ``within police guidelines,'' police said.
   They said Lebron had robbed someone of $10.
   On Saturday, four blocks away, 17-year-old Louis Liranso was
shot in the back by Officer Hyda Hernandez after he allegedly
lowered his hands and turned toward the officer. Liranso was
unarmed; the officer has been suspended and a grand jury is
examining the case.
   Lebron was the seventh person killed by New York police in the
first month of 1990; six of the shootings have occurred in the
borough of Brooklyn. In 1989 30 people killed by police; in 1988,
there were 25 and in 1987, 14.
   New Police Commissioner Lee Brown on Friday promised Bushwick
residents ``a thorough and complete investigation'' and
``appropriate action based upon the facts of the case.''
   ``I think the community will always be saddened when someone
loses a life, and when young people lose their lives it is an even
sadder event,'' said Brown. ``For us, it is always tragic when
police officers are involved in the incident.''
   Lebron's death has angered neighbors and friends, who said he
had been a happy kid. But one officer on the beat said Lebron was a
neighborhood tough who bullied others and was ``always on the
street, hanging out and drinking.''
   ``What we want is justice. We want the officer to pay for what
he did,'' said Lebron's 22-year-old brother, Ruben. He said he had
been eating dinner with his brother just 15 minutes before he died.
   ``I'll be right back,'' Ruben Lebron recalled his brother saying
as he ran out the door to get a soda.
   Friends spray-painted Lebron's graffiti tag name, ``Rase,'' in
8-foot red letters on a building around the corner from where he
was killed.
   Hundreds of residents marched on the local police precinct
Thursday night; three were arrested after the crowd began throwing
rocks and bottles at police in riot gear.
   ``It's just murder, plain old murder,'' one demonstrator said.
   ``People are tired of this,'' said one resident, Manuel Vasquez,
38. ``We're supposed to be more afraid of the criminals than the
cops. It's getting not that way anymore.''
   A light rain fell Friday outside the candy store, where two
lines of blood stretching from the sidewalk to the street were
still visible. Four floral arrangements lay where Lebron fell.
   ``I feel like crying,'' said 15-year-old Pearl Cantres, who
added a single white rose to the pile. She had also brought
Lebron's mother some flowers. ``I was thinking it could have
happened to me, to my brother, any of us,'' she said.
   She scrawled a message on cardboard with a black crayon: ``May
God take your soul and place it in a white box full of our tears of
pain.''
   ``He was always smiling,'' Ruben Lebron said, wiping a tear from
his cheek. ``He was the clown of the block. If this tragedy
happened to someone else, he'd make us laugh.''
   Bushwick is also where a woman who had tried to rid her
neighborhood of drugs was slain last summer. Police speculate that
Maria Hernandez was killed by angry dealers.
   Robert Hernandez, 17, recalled how neighborhood teen-agers,
inspired by her death, have since driven the dealers out of several
other blocks.
   ``We're not no vigilantes,'' he said. ``We fight with words.''
   A Hispanic police officer, who held his hat over his nameplate
as he described Lebron as a neighborhood tough, said the local
youths ``won't back down if they're with one another, not even to
an officer.''

   Two crowded commuter trains
collided at the height of the evening rush hour outside Frankfurt
on Friday, killing at least 17 people and injuring more than 70,
officials said.
   Hesse state Interior Minister Gottfried Milde earlier said
rescuers had pulled 15 bodies from the wreckage. Rescue workers
were still searching through the wreckage late Friday and an
updated police statement listed 17 dead and 72 injured, including
37 seriously.
   Walter Henss, a spokesman for the Federal Railroad network, said
the accident occurred after one of the drivers of the trains
apparently missed a stop signal on the heavily used run between
Frankfurt and Wiesbaden.
   Some cars derailed and rescue workers were unsure how many
passengers were trapped in the wreckage. The derailed cars also
crashed into a row of parked cars.
   Henss said both trains were traveling at relatively slow speed
when the collision occurred.
   The derailed cars forced authorities to close down a section of
track and to reroute other trains during rush hour.

   South Africa won worldwide praise Friday for
legalizing the African National Congress and promising to free
black leader Nelson Mandela, and Britain immediately restored
cultural and academic ties.
   Other nations tempered plaudits with reminders that apartheid
remained. Anti-apartheid groups asked governments to continue
economic and other sanctions, which they said had pushed the white
authorities to reform.
   Javier Perez de Cuellar, the U.N. secretary-general, described
President F.W. de Klerk's announcement as ``celestial music'' he
hoped would herald the end of apartheid.
   President Bush called it ``quite positive'' and said he would
review U.S. sanctions. A Bush aide said both de Klerk and Mandela,
an ANC leader when he was sent to jail, would be invited to the
White House.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said: ``We call
on all South African parties, including those unbanned by President
de Klerk, to take up this offer of negotiations and begin in
earnest the process of a peaceful transition to a non-racial
democratic South Africa.''
   The Soviet Union said the measures were ``an important and
long-expected step in the right direction,'' but the official news
agency Tass quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying: ``It is
necessary that they should be followed by practical actions,'' such
as lifting ``the state of emergency.''
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher called de Klerk's speech ``a
historic landmark,'' invited de Klerk to London and lifted cultural
and academic embargoes.
   ``We believe in carrots as well as sticks and they've had plenty
of the latter, they should now have some of the former,'' said Mrs.
Thatcher, who has been instrumental in thwarting harsh
international measures against South Africa.
   The prime minister, who said she will also invite Mandela to
Britain when the black nationalist leader is released, said the
U.S. policy of disinvestment and tightening sanctions was ``a
mistake.''
   British officials said that ``in due course'' she will raise the
issue of easing embargoes in the European Community and the
Commonwealth, the 49-nation association of Britain and its former
colonies.
   In a speech that reversed decades of official policy, de Klerk
also said he will legalize other black dissident groups, declare a
moratorium on executions, and lift more measures under a state of
emergency imposed in 1986.
   Sir Shridath Ramphal, secretary-general of the Commonwealth, the
49-nation association of Britain and its former colonies, said
South Africa had reached ``a moment of hope.''
   But ``much of President de Klerk's announcement is a statement
of intent,'' Ramphal said in a statement. ``Meanwhile all concerned
must work ... to convert promise into performance and ensure that
apartheid is ended.''
   Canada's external affairs minister, Joe Clark, who leads a
nine-nation Commonwealth committee monitoring sanctions, said he
was ``very encouraged.''
   Black African nations, South Africa's most hostile critics,
joined in guarded praise.
   Nigeria's foreign affairs minister, Rilwanu Lukman, said de
Klerk had taken ``the first concrete step in the long journey
toward the total eradication of apartheid and racial
discrimination.''
   Mozambique, South Africa's neighbor, played an excerpt of South
African music on the state radio and the announcer declared de
Klerk's speech ``allows us to see, shining strongly, a light at the
end of a tunnel that once seemed infinite.''
   Kenya and Sierra Leone both called the moves a ``step in the
right direction.''
   In Zambia, where the exiled ANC has been based, President
Kenneth Kaunda offered ``hearty congratulations for a job well
started, not well done. I wish him (De Klerk) the best of luck.''
   Israel, long suspected of helping South Africa evade a mandatory
international arms embargo and build nuclear arms, welcomed the
announcement. ``Israel will continue to follow favorably the
process of reform taking place in South Africa,'' said Foreign
Minister Moshe Arens.
   Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama of Japan called the measures
crucial to starting black-white negotiations in South Africa.
   West Germany, France and other Western European countries said
South Africa had moved in the right direction.
   Scandinavian nations, forceful opponents of apartheid, said the
time was not right to relax economic sanctions.
   ``The pressure of the South African regime must be kept up,''
Swedish Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson said.
   But Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers said he expected the
European Community nations to meet soon to discuss lifting some
embargoes. ``The situation has changed fundamentally,'' he said.
``A wall has come down.''
   U.S. sanctions have been the harshest of any imposed by South
Africa's major trading partners. The U.S. Congress has been
considering bills that seek to place a total trade embargo and ban
banks from rescheduling loans to South Africa.
   Main measures by the 12-nation European Community are a ban on
iron and steel imports from South Africa.

   Feuding Armenians and Azerbaijanis opened
peace talks Friday and immediately found common ground: Both sides
criticized the Kremlin for sending troops to their southern region.
   Armenian negotiators told reporters that the use of the Red Army
was unnecessary and was destabilizing the entire Caucasus region,
which includes Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia.
   The Armenians and the Azerbaijanis, meeting in the western
republic of Latvia, agreed to discuss the presence of the troops,
the estimated half-million refugees of both nationalities the
ethnic conflict has created, and other humanitarian issues.
   Both sides agreed not to raise the territorial dispute that
sparked the unrest. Armenians want political control over
Nagorno-Karabakh, a largely Armenian district located inside
Azerbaijan, but Azerbaijanis want the region to remain in their
hands.
   Baltic mediators, leaders of the three people's fronts movements
in Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania, said the talks could last two to
three months.
   In Baku, the Azerbaijani capital, leaders of the Azerbaijani
People's Front met with Soviet military commanders Thursday and
took a defiant stand, raising their demand that all 17,000 soldiers
be withdrawn.
   Lt. Gen. Vladimir S. Dubinyak, the military commandant, promised
to transmit the demand to Moscow, said Tofik Gosymov, one of the 14
directors of the people's front.
   ``If the question of the removal of the soldiers is not solved,
we won't negotiate with them and we won't cooperate,'' Gosymov said.
   He also said the military wanted to leave Baku for its own
reasons. He did not elaborate.
   The one-hour talks at the Azerbaijani Interior Ministry bypassed
the Azerbaijan Communist Party and the Caucasus republic's
government, underscoring the increasing clout wielded by the
grassroots People's Front.
   The party and government have been sharply criticized for
failing to control violence that began Jan. 13 with attacks against
Armenian residents and continued when Soviet troops stormed Baku a
week later.
   At least 214 were killed and more than 500 injured in the
unrest, according to official reports Friday. The republics have
been locked in a decades-old dispute, largely centering on
Nagorno-Karabakh. The Armenians are mostly Christian; the
Azerbaijaini are predominantly Shiite Moslem.
   During the talks with the military, the People's Front also
demanded release of arrested members and an explanation of what
they said were military assaults on the group's headquarters.
   Dubinyak, accompanied by his assistant for political affairs,
Maj. Gen. Anatoly I. Kirilyuk, and an official of the national
Interior Ministry, said those issues could only be decided in
Moscow, Gosymov reported.
   Gosymov said the People's Front needed at least a schedule for
withdrawal to bring the situation in Baku back to normal. With such
a schedule, ``We can appeal to the people to go back to work and
they will, 100 percent,'' he said.
   Soviet officials say more than 80 percent of Baku's workforce is
back on the job, but the People's Front claims the figure is much
lower.
   On Thursday, Dubinyak told reporters that the 11 p.m.-to-5 a.m.
curfew could be lifted and some soldiers withdrawn as early as
mid-February.

<HEAD>Coalition to Participate in Elections Under Avril</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A coalition including two of
Haiti's main parties said Friday it was satisfied with Lt. Gen.
Prosper Avril's pledge to hold elections this year as promised and
would participate in them.
   The National Alliance for Democracy and Progress said in a
statement published by the independent daily Le Matin it
``expresses its satisfaction'' with the lifting this week of a
nine-day state of siege.
   Last month, some coalition leaders said they were beaten by
police during a crackdown on opponents of Avril's government
   In its statement, the coalition said ``all true democrats''
should urge the independently appointed Electoral Council to ``take
all useful steps to ensure the regularity of the electoral process
and the credibility of the results.'' Avril promised on Wednesday
hold the elections scheduled for October. He acknowledged brutality
by police in the crackdown and said seven exiled leaders could
return.
   Three of those _ Louis Roy, considered the father of the
constitution; conservative politician Hubert de Ronceray; and
businessman Antoine Izmery _ said in Washington this week they
would not do so under Avril's ``regime of terror.''
   Max Bourjolly, deputy leader of the Communist Party, said in
Paris he would return if permitted, but would not take part in
elections.
   Marc Bazin, a conservative former presidential candidate, leads
the National Alliance for Democracy and Progress. Several members
of his party, the Movement To Establish Democracy, said they were
beaten in police custody during the state of siege Jan. 20-29.
   Witnesses said deputy leader Serge Gilles, a socialist, and
several supporters were severely beaten by plainclothes police
after being arrested at his home Jan. 20.
   Gilles said he suffered a burst eardrum and dislocated vertebra
in a second beating at the National Palace.
   Francois Benoit, Haiti's ambassador to the United States and a
former vice president of Bazin's party, resigned to protest the
crackdown.
   Several other opposition leaders remain in hiding and have said
they would boycott any elections held under Avril.
   The general declared the state of seige the day after Col. Andre
Neptune, his wife and a servant were shot to death by assailants as
yet unidentified.

<HEAD>Front Keeps its Grip on Romania Despite Power-Sharing Accord</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ABNER KATZMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ruling National Salvation Front
apparently will keep control of the government until May 20
elections, despite an accord with opposition parties to share
power, the Front's vice president said Friday.
   Cazimir Ionescu said the Front will take half the seats in a new
Council of National Unity agreed at a conference with 29 opposition
parties Thursday.
   The National Salvation Front took absolute control of Romania
during the December revolution that toppled Communist dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu, who was later executed along with his wife,
Elena.
   Although the opposition said it accepted Thursday's outcome as a
true power-sharing agreement, the Front will still apparently have
the major say in running things until May. Romanians vote then in
the first free, multiparty elections here since shortly after World
War II.
   The new 180-member Council is to be split evenly _ 90 from
political parties and 90 Romanian national figures and others from
all walks of life. A communique announcing formation of the Council
said farmers, workers, students and all other forces that took part
in the revolution would be represented.
   On Saturday, as its last act before dissolving itself, the
ruling council of the Front will meet to decide whom to name as the
90 non-political appointees on the Council of National Unity.
   Ionescu told two Westeren reporters, ``If we should make the
mistake of reshuffling the government ... before the elections,
this would mean that in the next two or three months we would see a
destabilization of the economy.
   ``We decided that the government would not have any political
color, but only a technocratic one.''
   He indicated that the current government, installed by the
Front's council, would remain intact after the the Council of
National Unity is established.
   Two members of the Front's council have resigned.
   One, Dimitru Mazilu, who was council vice president, quit after
accusing the Front of ``Stalinist tactics.''
   Asked if the new Council of National Unity would have veto power
over government actions, Ionescu replied: ``This will be decided
during the future meetings by the council itself.''
   But he said the new council probably will decide the most
important issues.
   He said it will decide how to operate and whether to have a
president.
   But he considered it likely that interim President Ion Iliescu
would continue in office under the new agreement, citing the threat
of instability otherwise.
   Asked if the opposition would oppose domination of the Council
of National Unity by Front appointees, Ionescu said, ``If they
didn't criticize (it) until now ... I don't think there could be
anyone else who could criticize this fact.''
   As an apparent concession to the opposition, the new governing
council will have three members from each of the nation's 29
political parties as well as three from the Front itself.
   The Front has agreed to transform itself into a political party
and separate from its ruling council, which now runs the government
and has total control of all state apparatus, including television
and radio.
   The opposition had protested against the Front's organizing the
elections, parceling out broadcast time to the different parties,
and at the same time fielding candidates itself.
   The accord came after 10 days of violent pro- and anti-Front
street demonstrations, including synchronized attacks on 28
different headquarters of the National Peasants Party, the dominant
and best-organized opposition group.
   On Friday, a military tribunal convicted four former leaders of
the Ceausescu government of being accomplices to a genocide and
sentenced then to life in prison, Radio Bucharest reported.
   Found guilty of backing Ceausescu's orders to shoot
demonstrators during the revolution were Emil Bobu, 62, former
secretary of the Communist Party Central Committee; former state
council Vice President Manea Manescu, 74; Ion Dinca, 62, former
Politburo member, and former Interior Minister Tudor Postelnicu, 59.

prisoners henceforth will have an automatic right to appeal.
   _ REPEAL of the Separate Amenities Act promised during the
current session of Parliament, ending the right of local
authorities to racially segregate public facilities.
   _ LIFTING of emergency regulations regarding education and the
press, except the restrictions on photography and filming of
political unrest.
   _ ENDING emergency restrictions on freedom of speech, movement,
assembly and work that were imposed on 374 freed detainees, and the
emergency regulations which allowed such restrictions to be
repealed.
   _ DETENTION without trial is retained, but limited to six
months, and detainees will have the right to legal representation
and a doctor of their own choice.

   Here are excerpts from President
F.W. de Klerk's speech Friday in which he legalized or lifted
restrictions on more than 60 organizations, including the African
National Congress, and said the ANC's jailed leader Nelson Mandela
will be freed soon:
   Mr Speaker, members of Parliament
   The general election on Sept. 6, 1989, placed our country
irrevocably on the road of drastic change. Underlying this is the
growing realization by an increasing number of South Africans that
only a negotiated understanding among the representative leaders of
the entire population is able to ensure lasting peace.
   The alternative is growing violence, tension and conflict. That
is unacceptable and in nobody's interest. The well-being of all in
this country is linked inextricably to the ability of the leaders
to come to terms with one another on a new dispensation. No one can
escape this simple truth.
   On its part, the government will accord the process of
negotiation the highest priority. The aim is totally new and just
constitutional dispensation in which every inhabitant will enjoy
equal rights, treatment and opportunity in every sphere of endeavor
_ constitutional, social and economic.
   I hope that this new Parliament will play a constructive part in
both the prelude to negotiations and the negotiating process
itself. I wish to ask all of you who identify yourselves with the
broad aim of a new South Africa, and that is the overwhelming
majority:
   _ Let us put petty politics aside when we discuss the future
during this session.
   _ Help us build a broad consensus about the fundamentals of a
new, realistic and democratic dispensation.
   _ Let us work together on a plan that will rid our country of
suspicion and steer it away from domination and radicalism of any
kind.
   _ During the term of this new Parliament, we shall have to deal,
complimentary to one another, with the normal processes of
legislation and day-to-day government, as well as with the process
of negotiation and renewal.
   Within this framework I wish to deal first with several matters
more closely concerned with the normal process of government before
I turn specifically to negotiation and related issues.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FOREIGN RELATIONS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The government is aware of the important part the world at-large
has to play in the realization of our country's national interests.
   Without contact and cooperation with the rest of the world we
cannot promote the well-being and security of our citizens. The
dynamic for South Africa as well. Important advances have been
made, among precluded previously by ideological considerations.
   I hope this trend will be encouraged by the important change of
climate that is taking place in South Africa.
   For South Africa, indeed for the whole world, the past year has
been one of change and major upheaval. In Eastern Europe and even
the Soviet Union itself, political and economic upheaval surged
forward in an unstoppable tide. At the same time, Beijing
temporarily smothered with brutal violence the yearning of the
people of the Chinese mainland for greater freedom.
   The year of 1989 will go down in history as the year in which
Stalinist Communism expired. ...
</TEXT>
<HEAD>HUMAN RIGHTS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The whole question of protecting individual and minority rights
... is still under consideration by the Law Commission. Therefore,
it would be inappropriate for the government to express a view on
the details now. However, certain matters of principle have emerged
fairly clearly ...
   The government accepts the principle of recognition and
protection of the fundamental individual rights which form the
constitutional basis of most Western democracies. ...
   It is neither the government's policy nor its intention that any
group _ in whichever way it may be defined _ shall be favored above
or in relation to any of the others.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE DEATH PENALTY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   We have now reached the position ... that the death penalty
should be limited as an option of sentence to extreme cases, and
specifically through broadening judicial discretion in the
imposition of sentence; and
   That an automatic right of appeal be granted to those under
sentence of death. ...
</TEXT>
<HEAD>NEGOTIATION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   I wish to urge every political and community leader, in and
outside Parliament, to approach the new opportunities which are
being created, constructively. There is no time left for advancing
all manner of new conditions that will delay the negotiating
process.
   The steps that have been decided are the following:
   _The prohibition of the African National Congress, the Pan
Africanist Congress, the South African Communist Party and a number
of subsidiary organizations is being rescinded.
   _People serving prison sentences merely because they were
members of one of these organizations, or because they committed
another offense which was merely an offense because of prohibition
on one of the organizations was in force, will be identified and
released. Prisoners who have been sentenced for other offenses such
as murder, terrorism or arson are not affected by this.
   _The media emergency regulations as well as the education
emergency regulations are being abolished in their entirety.
   _The security emergency regulations will be amended to still
make provision for effecitive control over visual material
pertaining to scenes of unrest.
   _The restrictions in terms of the emergency regulations on 33
organizations are being rescinded. The organizations include the
following: National Education Crisis Committee, South African
National Students Congress, United Democratic Front, Cosatu, Die
Blanke Bevrydingsbeweging van Suid-Afrika.
   _The conditions imposed in terms of the security emergency
regulations on 374 people on their release, are being rescinded and
the regulations which provide for such conditions are being
abolished.
   _The period of detention in terms of the security emergency
regulations will be limited henceforth to six months. Detainees
also acquire the right to legal representation and a medical
practitioner of their own choosing.
   These decisions by the Cabinet are in accordance with the
government's declared intention to normalize the political process
in South Africa without jeapardizing the maintenance of the good
order. They were preceded by thorough and unanimous advice by a
group of officials which included members of the security community.
   Implementation will be immediate and, where necessary, notices
will appear in the Government Gazette from tomorrow. ...

<HEAD>Organizers of Anti-Drug TV Special Plan More Programs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prime-time special on the dangers of drugs,
which ran simultaneously on all the city's major television
stations, has flooded police lines with crime tips and may be
duplicated in other cities later this year.
   Organizers of ``Texas CrackDown!'' hailed the project for its
cooperation by competing media.
   The two-hour program aired simultaneously on three network
affiliates, one independent TV station and three radio stations,
and was coordinated with newspaper coverage and programs in schools
and by anti-drug groups.
   Television stations and crime-stoppers programs in Houston, San
Antonio, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, New Orleans and
Kansas City are being contacted about producing local versions of
the program, said executive producer Hugh Akin.
   In Dallas, response to the show overwhelmed organizers and law
enforcement agencies.
   Arbitron ratings for Jan. 23 showed that ``Texas Crackdown!''
was watched by 72 percent of the 1.7 million households that have
televisions in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, Akin said.
   ``We felt as though it would be effective. But we did not expect
the kind of overwhelming response we got,'' said Greg MacAleese,
program co-producer and executive director of the Greater Dallas
Crime Commission.
   Since the program aired, the Dallas Police Department's Crime
Stoppers Program has received up to six times its normal volume of
daily calls, officers said.
   ``We are pleased,'' police Sgt. Barry Whitfield said Friday.
``I'm sure much good will come of it.''
   One tip led to the arrest of a fugitive whose case was featured
on the program and who was wanted on warrants issued by four law
agencies.
   About 1,000 callers sought help from the Dallas Council on
Alcoholism and Drug Abuse in the week after ``Texas Crackdown!''
aired, Akin said. The council normally gets 183 calls a week.
   The 50 phone toll-free lines set up to handle calls during the
show were overloaded, Akin said, adding he'd double the number of
lines for future programs.
   Producers are capable of doing six more shows in the next year,
and Akin said they hope to negotiate deals with other major-market
TV stations by the end of February or early March.
   In addition, broadcasters in smaller markets around the country
are considering single- or multiple-station versions of the show,
he said. Akin and MacAleese may consult with those stations, Akin
said.
   The two men raised $210,000 from hospitals, foundations and
corporations to fund the project.
   At least one school district has requested program tapes, and
others have made inquiries, said MacAleese. For the first ``Texas
CrackDown!'' many school districts assigned homework and classroom
projects based on a program questionnaire published in local
newspapers.
   Akin said that the morning after one north Texas couple watched
the show, their two teen-age daughters admitted they had drug
problems and were put in treatment programs.
   ``We hope there will be more examples of such openness between
kids and their parents, because that is how the drug problem will
get solved,'' he said.

<HEAD>Snow Across Northern States, Along Rockies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Snow was scattered across the nation's northern tier of states
and along the Rockies on Friday, and winter storm warnings and
watches were posted across parts of the Plains, Midwest and
Northeast.
   At midday, snow fell from eastern Washington state across the
Idaho Panhandle, over southeastern Wyoming, eastern and central
Colorado, northwestern New Mexico, much of Kansas, southern and
eastern Nebraska, eastern South Dakota, eastern North Dakota,
north-central Minnesota, south-central Iowa, central Upper
Michigan, eastern Lower Michigan, much of inland New York state,
southern Vermont and southern New Hampshire.
   Snow and poor visibility in fog caused air traffic delays and
numerous accidents Friday around the Denver area, which accumulated
4 inches.
   Interstate 25 was closed northbound Friday afternoon from the
Greenland exit to Castle Rock because of numerous accidents and
blowing snow, the Colorado State Patrol said.
   Heaviest snowfall during the six hours up to noon included 4
inches at Buffalo, N.Y., and 3 inches at Mount Clemens, Mich.;
Niagara Falls, N.Y.; rochester, N.Y.; and Syracuse, N.Y.
   Winter storm warnings were posted overnight across the
Susquehanna and Catskill regions of New York state, and the upper
Susquehanna Valley of eastern Pennsylvania.
   Winter storm watches were posted into Saturday over much of Iowa
and northern Illinois, extreme southeastern Nebraska, much of
Kansas and the northwestern third of Oklahoma.
   In the Southwest, snowfall overnight from Thursday into Friday
morning across Arizona included 8 to 10 inches at Pinetop-Lakeside,
4 inches at Payson and Willcox, and 2 inches at Winslow.
   Strong chinook winds blowing at 30 to 50 mph caused travel
problems across north-central Montana by whipping up blowing,
drifting snow. The chinook wind also rapidly warmed the eastern
slopes of the Montana Rockies.
   Rain fell from east-central and southern New England across
southeastern New York state and Pennsylvania.
   Freezing rain extended from northwestern Missouri across
northeastern and east-central Kansas through south-central Kansas
into southwestern Oklahoma.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 3
degrees below zero at Warroad, Minn., to 87 at Fort Myers, Fla.
   Friday's low for the Lower 48 states was 18 below zero at
International Falls, Minn.

<TEXT>
   The events in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe ... weaken the
capability of organizations which were previously supported
strongly from those quarters.
   The activities of the organizations from which the prohibitions
are now being lifted, no longer entail the same degree of threat to
internal security which initially necessitated the imposition of
the prohibitions.
   There have been important shifts of emphasis in the statements
and points of view of the most important of the organizations
concerned, which indicate a new approach and a preference for
peaceful solutions.
   The South African Police is convinced that it is able, in the
present circumstances, to combat violence and other crimes
perpetrated also by members of these organizations and to bring
offenders to justice without the aid of prohibitions on
organizations.
   About one matter there should be no doubt. The lifting of the
prohibition of the said organizations does not signify in the least
the approval ... of terrorism or crimes of violence committed under
their banner or which may be perpetrated in the future. Equally, it
should not be interpreted as a deviation from the government's
principles, among other things, against their economic policy and
aspects of their constitutional policy. This will be dealt with in
debate and negotiation.
   At the same time I wish to emphasize that the maintenance of law
and order dare not be jeopardized. The government will not forsake
its duty in this connection. Violence from whichever source, will
be fought with all available might. Peaceful protest may not become
the springboard for lawlessness, violence and intimidation. No
democratic country can tolerate that.
   Strong emphasis will be placed as well on even more effective
law enforcement. Proper provision of manpower and means for the
police and all who are involved with the enforcement of the law
will be ensured. ...
   It is my intention to terminate the state of emergency
completely as soon as circumstances justify it ... There is still
conflict which is manifesting itself mainly in Natal (Province). .
..
   Our country and all its people have been embroiled in conflict,
tension and violent struggle for decades. It is time for us to
break out of the cycle of violence and break through to peace and
reconciliation.
   With the steps the government has taken, it has proven its good
faith and the table is laid for sensible leaders to begin talking
about a new dispensation. ...
   Among other things, those aims include a new, democratic
constitution; universal franchise; no domination; equality before
an independent judiciary; the protection of minorities as well as
of individual rights; freedom of religion; a sound economy based on
proven economic principles and private enterprise; dynamic programs
directed at better education, health services, housing and social
conditions for all. ...
   I wish to put it plainly that the government has taken a firm
decision to release Mr. Mandela unconditionally. ...
   The government will take a decision soon on the date of his
release. Unfortunately, a further short passage of time is
unavoidable. ... In the case of Mr. Mandela there are factors in
the way of his immediate release, of which his personal
circumstances and safety are not the least. He has not been an
ordinary prisoner for quite some time. Because of that, his case
requires particular circumspection.
   Today's announcements go to the heart of what black leaders _
also Mr. Mandela _ have been advancing over the years as their
reason for having resorted to violence. The allegation has been
that the government did not wish to talk to them and that they were
deprived of their right to normal political activity. ...
   Without conceding that violence has ever been justified, I wish
to say today to those who argued in this manner:
   _The government wishes to talk to all leaders who seek peace.
   _The unconditional lifting of the prohibition on the said
organizations places everybody in a position to pursue politics
freely.
   _The justification for violence which was always advanced, no
longer exists. ...
   _There is no longer any reasonable excuse for the continuation
of violence. The time for talking has arrived and whoever still
makes excuses does not really wish to talk.
   Therefore, I repeat my invitation with greater conviction than
ever: Walk through the open door, take your place at the
negotiating table together with the government and other leaders
who have important power bases inside and outside of Parliament.
   Henceforth, everybody's political points of view will be tested
against their realism, their workability and their fairness. The
time for negotiation has arrived.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CONCLUSION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   All reasonable people in this country _ by far the majority _
anxiously await a message of hope. It is our responsibility as
leaders in all spheres to provide that message realistically with
courage and conviction. If we fail in that, the ensuing chaos, the
demise of stability and progress, will forever be held against us.
...
   I call on the international community to re-evaluate its
position and to adopt a positive attitude toward the dynamic
evolution which is taking place in South Africa.

   Marina Ogilvy, the pregnant 23-year-old
cousin of Queen Elizabeth II, on Friday married the father of her
child, freelance photographer Paul Mowatt, in a small church
wedding outside London.
   In marrying a Roman Catholic, Miss Ogilvy gave up her claim to
the British throne. She was 24th in line.
   Miss Ogilvy was greeted with a kiss from her father, Sir Angus
Ogilvy, when she arrived at St. Andrew's Church near her parents'
home 10 miles southwest of London.
   In October, Miss Ogilvy went to the British news media and said
that when she told her parents she was pregnant, they demanded she
either marry quickly or have an abortion. When she refused, they
cut off her family allowance, she said.
   The young couple had planned to marry sometime after the baby's
birth. The baby is due in May, Miss Ogilvy said.
   Ogilvy and his wife, Princess Alexandra, responded by issuing a
public statement saying they loved their daughter, had not cut her
off and that she always was welcome at their home.
   The princess is sister of the Duke of Kent and is the queen's
first cousin.
   The bride wore a rust-colored bolero jacket in crushed velvet
with a gold tassle trim over a mid-calf-length fitted black velvet
dress. She also wore a large wide-brimmed black hat with a
turned-up front.
   Mowatt, 26, wore a sober dark blue suit.
   The 45-minute private service was attended by about 40 guests,
who did not include the queen or any members of her immediate
family.
   Afterward, Ogilvy said he felt ``fine'' and was ``delighted,''
while Princess Alexandra declared: ``It was a lovely wedding.''

<HEAD>Armenian Patriarch of Jerusalem Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yeghishe Derderian, Armenian patriarch of
Jerusalem and spiritual leader of the 8,000 Armenians in Israel,
the occupied West Bank and Jordan, has dead of a heart attack,
church officials said. He was 80.
   Church secretary George Hintlian said Derderian, one of the
three custodians of Jerusalem's Christian holy places, died
Thursday evening in his home at the St. James convent and monastery
complex in Jerusalem's walled Old City. He had been ill with
influenza for two days.
   Bells tolled in the Armenian quarter Friday to announce the
death. Armenian women dressed in black greeted each other somberly
as they entered the convent to pray. Black flags hung beside the
white-and-red banner of the patriarchate.
   Bishop Guregh Kapikian was named acting patriarch.
   Another bishop, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
renegade Bishop Shahe Ajemian entered the monastery at 9 a.m. with
eight armed men and declared himself patriarch of Jerusalem.
   Derderian expelled Ajemian from the brotherhood of the monastery
almost three years ago.
   Jerusalem police spokesman Uzi Sandouri said no information or
complaints about the alleged takeover had been received from the
Armenian community.
   According to the bishop, Ajemian ``entered the monastery with
eight armed people and he has refused to leave. We don't know
exactly what they plan to do.''
   He did not describe the men's weapons.
   Derderian was born in Van, eastern Turkey, and came to Jerusalem
in 1922. He studied at the St. James theological seminary, served
as its dean before being named deputy patriarch in 1949, and became
patriarch of Jerusalem in 1960, Hintlian said.
   Some Armenian priests are permitted to marry, but Derderian, a
monk, remained celibate.
   He wrote 22 books, including biographies of religious figures
and poetry, Hintlian said, adding: ``He was quite informed about
the world and he was a great traveler.''
   The Armenian Church follows the Eastern rite and does not accept
the authority of the pope.

   The National Geographic Society says
Alaska is where it belongs and shouldn't be moved closer to the
center of the world map as a state senator requested.
   Alaska state Sen. Jim Duncan wrote to National Geographic
magazine editors, saying too many maps show Alaska on the left.
   ``A constituent has written to me concerned that most world maps
depict Alaska at the extreme left rather than in the center part
which would be accurate,'' the Juneau Democrat said in his letter
last month. ``We don't mean to intimate Alaska is at the center of
the world, even though it is for Alaskans.''
   John Garver, the society's chief cartographer, replied that the
best way to produce a world map without cutting Europe and Asia in
half results in Alaska's placement way out at the top left corner.
   The society in 1975 switched from producing maps with the United
States in the center to ones with Europe as the midpoint, putting
Alaska on the left, Garver said.
   ``We appreciate the dilemma with Alaska in this situation, but
all things considered we feel that this is the best approach in
displaying the continents and oceans of the world,'' Garver said.
   ``I felt they were a little bit defensive in their reply,''
Duncan said Thursday.
   Earlier this week, the House passed a resolution asking book
publishers, magazines and newspapers to put the state in the
northwest corner of the United States instead of off the California
coast.

   A radio station's find-the-mayor
contest led about a dozen people to the office of low-profile Mayor
Louis Saavedra, who posed for photographs with participants hoping
to win a free dinner.
   The station offered a meal at a restaurant to anyone who could
get their picture taken with the mayor between Feb. 1 and Feb. 15.
Winners of the dinner for two can up the ante to dinner for four if
they can persuade the mayor to dine with them.
   Brawna Martin, promotions director for KRST-FM and sister
station KRZY-AM, said Thursday that listeners had complained they
hadn't seen the mayor even before he created a stir when he
declined to attend the Hispano Chamber of Commerce's annual banquet
last week.
   ``There were all sorts of important political figures and
celebrities attending, but our first Hispanic mayor was not
there,'' Martin said.
   Saavedra, who took office in December, learned of the contest
Thursday when camera-slinging visitors began stalking the waiting
area outside his office.
   ``I've had some nice visitors who broke up what would have been
an otherwise dull and hard-working day,'' Saavedra said. ``About a
dozen people came in, took some pictures and visited a bit. They
didn't get in the way.''
   Peggy Clemmons, the mayor's personal secretary, said Saavedra
posed for pictures between appointments and wasn't upset about the
contest.
   ``He has a wonderful sense of humor about the situation,''
Clemmons said.
   ``I would hope the mayor thinks it's funny and entertaining and
takes it with a grain of salt,'' Martin said. ``It's just that
inquiring minds want to know. So we asked a question that's on
everyone's mind: Where is Louie Saavedra? Where is our mayor?
   ``A few radio station listeners called to tell us it was easier
to spot Elvis than Louis Saavedra. Scary, huh?''

<HEAD>University of Wisconsin Board Votes to Keep ROTC on Campus</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   University of Wisconsin regents refused
Friday to expel the Reserve Officers' Training Corps, a move sought
by a faculty group to protest the military's ban on enlisting
homosexuals.
   The board voted 13-3 to accept the recommendation of University
President Kenneth Shaw, which calls for an aggressive lobbying
effort to reverse the Pentagon policy.
   Shaw's recommendation was adopted rather than a faculty-backed
resolution that demanded ROTC be expelled in 1993 if the military
continued to deny enlistment to homosexual men and women.
   ``I think it was the appropriate resolution to pass,'' said
Regent Erroll Davis Jr. ``This resolution keeps the issue in the
front line and will force us to deal with it.''
   In December, the faculty at UW-Madison, the system's largest
campus, approved a resolution asking the university to expel ROTC
from campus in 1993 if the military continued to ban homosexuals.
Several other campus groups followed with similar resolutions.
   Shaw responded this week by saying he didn't believe severing
the university's ties to the military would effectively encourage
the Pentagon to change its policy. Furthermore, eliminating
military programs would hurt those students who benefit from them,
he said.
   About 1,300 students are enrolled in Army, Navy and Air Force
ROTC programs throughout the system's 13 major campuses; one-third
are at UW-Madison, which has 42,000 students.
   The resolution approved Friday differs from one approved by the
regents in 1987 because it requires UW administrators to report
annually to the board on the progress of its efforts to change the
military's policy.
   ``We intend to hold their feet to the fire,'' Regent Ruth Clusen
said, referring to UW administrators. ``Writing letters isn't going
to get us anywhere.''
   The 1987 resolution, which said the university would lobby the
military, was criticized for being too broad and ineffective.
   Capt. Cheryl Batterman, head of UW recruiting for the Air Force
ROTC, was pleased the regents rejected the faculty's recommendation
but said the resolution might make it hard to lure students to UW
campuses.
   ``We're already feeling the pinch,'' she said. ``I had hoped
they would've gotten this all resolved at once. Now, we still don't
know what might happen. That's a hard plan to sell to students and
parents.''

<HEAD>Government Urges Delay in Use of Reagan Diary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department on Friday urged a delay
in turning over 33 excerpts from former President Reagan's diaries
to Iran-Contra defendant John Poindexter and said a summary of the
entries should be compiled for Poindexter's use instead.
   U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene had set a deadline of
Monday for Reagan to give the nearly three dozen excerpts to his
former national security adviser, who is scheduled to go on trial
Feb. 20.
   In urging a postponement, the Justice Department said many of
the 33 entries duplicate material that came to light in last year's
Iran-Contra trial of former White House aide Oliver North.
   ``Indeed, there may be no information in the diary entries
covered by'' Greene's court order ``that is not in the public
domain,'' the Justice Department said in a five-page brief.
   It said Iran-Contra prosecutors and Poindexter's lawyers should
attempt to draft a stipulation covering the facts contained in the
diary entries. Greene can then compare the proposed stipulation
with the diary entries ``to ensure that all pertinent information
has been covered,'' said the Justice Department.
   A stipulation is an agreement on facts by both sides in a
lawsuit.
   ``We firmly believe that such an order is likely to obviate any
need for the diary entries to be disclosed,'' said the Justice
Department. ``The Court will thereby avoid a possible
constitutional confrontation and the serious potential for delay
such a confrontation would cause.''
   President Reagan could raise the defense of executive privilege
and argue that, under the Constitution, he does not have to turn
over confidential documents used in reaching presidential decisions.
   Under the Justice Department's proposal, Poindexter's lawyers
would not be permitted to see the diary entries during any
negotiating process. Therefore, they almost certainly will oppose
the plan.
   The Justice Department noted that information in one of the
diary entries concerning Reagan's call to the president of Honduras
already is summarized in stipulations from the North trial. The
telephone call focused on a shipment of ammunition for the Contras
that had been seized by a Honduran military commander. The Honduran
president assured Reagan the commander would be ordered to deliver
the ammunition to the rebels.

<HEAD>Second Ford Plant Idled by Labor Strife</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CUAUTITLAN, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A second Ford Motor Co. plant in
Mexico has been hit by a strike, with workers on Friday demanding
wage and benefit increases, a union spokesman said.
   The walkout that began Thursday idled production at the plant in
the northern city of Chihuahua, one of the Detroit auto giant's
three assembly lines in the country.
   At Ford's plant in Cuautitlan, workers maintained a
three-week-old picket line despite a company back-to-work call.
Ford shut the plant, 15 miles north of Mexico City, on Jan. 8 after
150 to 250 thugs shot and beat unionists, killing one and injuring
nine.
   Workers at the plant have charged some union officials are
corrupt and pro-management.
   Union spokesman Julian Salcedeo said the strike in Chihuahua was
called to pressure Ford for wage and benefit increases in
collective bargaining contract negotiations.
   ``It's wretched, the amount they're offering us,'' said Salcedo.
   Ford has offered a 12 percent raise; the workers are demanding a
15 percent raise as well as hefty increases in benefits.
   Pickets from the 800-member union local paralyzed the plant,
which produces about 1,000 engines a day for export to U.S. and
Canadian markets.
   A federal arbitration board in Mexico City is mediating the
Chihuahua conflict.
   In addition to a raise, the Chihuahua workers want a 13 percent
increase in interest on savings withheld by the company, a 10
percent hike in commodity coupons, higher vacation and holiday pay
and bigger Christmas bonuses, Salcedo said.
   The labor strife at the Cuautitlan plant centers on a struggle
for internal union reform. A picket has been up since Ford closed
the plant on Jan. 8.
   ``The company is accessible; the labor federation is the biggest
problem,'' said Alfredo Arista Ibarra, a member of the 21-person
union negotiating committee.
   Despite the pickets, more than 1,000 mostly non-union workers
returned to their jobs when Ford issued a back-to-work call Tuesday.
   Company spokesman Carlos Bandala said the plant can produce
about 40 vehicles a day with the skeleton crew. The plant's 3,800
employees usually produce about 450 cars and trucks a day for the
Mexican market.
   Arista said most workers are refusing to go back to work until
the Mexican Labor Federation, which has controlled the Cuautitlan
local for more than 20 years, accepts a slate of demands for union
democracy.
   Ford's production line in the northwestern city of Hermosillo,
Sonora, has not been affected by the labor conflict.

<HEAD>Greece to Expel Turkish Consul in Komotini</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greece will expel the Turkish consul in
the northeastern town of Komotini, who referred to Greek Moslems as
``fellow countrymen,'' Foreign Minister Antonis Samaras said Friday
night.
   Samaras made the announcement after Turkey refused to recall the
consul, Kemal Gur. He did not mention deadline.
   One of many issues in centuries of enmity between Greece and
Turkey is whether the 120,000 Moslems in Greece should be called
Greek Moslems or ethnic Turks.
   Gur has been accused of fanning passions between Christians and
Moslems in Thrace, which borders Turkey in northeastern Greece.
   The foreign minister said Turkey ``insists on describing the
Moslem minority in our country as `fellow countrymen, or the
equivalent term: citizens of Turkish origin.'''
   ``This position represents a blatant violation of the Lausanne
Treaty, which recognizes only the religious identity of the
minority and refers to it as Moslem for this reason,'' Samaras said.
   Turkey committed ``unacceptable interventions in the domestic
affairs of our country,'' he said. ``Consequently, the Greek
government is forced to proceed with the expulsion of the Turkish
consul general in Komotini.''
   The Lausanne Treaty of 1923 calls for an exchange of populations
and an end to hostilities between Greece and Turkey, and specifies
that Moslems in Greece be called Greek Moslems.
   The latest trouble began when two prominent Moslems were
convicted of distributing election campaign material referring to
Moslems as Turkish Moslem, which is illegal. A court in Komotini
sentenced Ahmet Sadik, a former member of Parliament, and local
politician Ibrahim Sherif to 18 months in prison each.
   Moslems protesting the sentences clashed with Christians on
Tuesday in Komotini. Scores of shops belonging to Moslems were
damaged.
   Other charges are pending against Sadik, including disseminating
false information.
   A prosecutor in Thrace reported to the Supreme Court in Athens
that holding Sadik's trial in Komotini, as planned, would cause
further protests and could lead to a breakdown of law and order.
   Legal sources said the court was considering a change of venue.

   A former World Health Organization consultant
accused of sending out computer diskettes that crippled computers
in six countries appeared in federal court Friday in an extradition
case.
   Joseph W. Popp, 39, is charged in warrants issued by Scotland
Yard in London with blackmail and extortion for distributing the
diskettes, which were said to contain information on AIDS. He was
arrested Thursday and is being held on a federal fugitive warrant.
   Popp told U.S. Magistrate Joseph W. Bartunek he was under a
psychiatrist's care and must take medication for a mental condition.
   Bartunek said he would schedule another court hearing after Popp
is evaluated by two psychiatrists to see if he is competent to face
extradition proceedings. A hearing date wasn't set, and Popp was
ordered to remain in the Bedford Heights jail in suburban Cleveland.
   Popp, of Willowick, about 10 miles east of Cleveland, was
arrested Thursday.
   Popp's attorney, John P. Kilroy, had asked that his client be
kept in a hospital rather than jail because of his mental condition.
   ``He's an internationally respected researcher,'' Kilroy said.
``I don't think he'd pose any risk to flee.''
   Kilroy said Popp is an anthropologist and until December had a
contract with the Geneva-based World Health Organization, working
sometimes in England but mainly in Geneva and Africa.
   Gary D. Arbeznik, assistant U.S. attorney in Cleveland, said an
arrest warrant was issued in London on Jan. 18 contending Popp
mailed about 20,000 diskettes from that city about Dec. 11.
   The U.S. attorney's office in Cleveland said the diskettes had
information on acquired immune deficiency syndrome for hospitals,
researchers and government agencies. Those who used the program
subsequently found they were unable to retrieve data from their
computers.
   At the time the diskettes began causing problems in early
December, London authorities said it had been received by users in
Britian, Norway, Sweden, Belgium, Denmark and California.
   Arbeznik said the diskette packages included a warning that if
the diskette were inserted into a computer, a leasing fee would be
charged.
   The program instructed the computer user to send a fee of up to
$378 to a company called PC CYBORG with a Panama address, federal
prosecutors said.
   Upon payment of the money, the recipient would receive a
``decontamination disk'' that would stop the computer virus,
authorities said.
   ``It appears to me ... a clear warning was given on the
package,'' Kilroy said in a telephone interview after Popp's court
appearance. ``The facts will show his actions were not criminal in
nature.''

   Jesse Jackson's 1988 presidential campaign
negotiated a debt settlement with a California hotel owned by a
Jackson supporter but failed to report the debt or the agreement as
required, according to the supporter and election records.
   The hotel owner, A. Bruce Rozet, on Friday confirmed a $75,000
Jackson campaign bill at the Hollywood Roosevelt was settled for
$45,500 but disputed an account by two former employers who said
Rozet _ a Jackson delegate at the 1988 Democratic convention _
forgave the remaining $30,000 as a gift to Jackson.
   The Jackson campaign said it did not believe it had violated the
law. It said it did not report the initial hotel bill as a debt
because it disputed the bill and that it did report to the Federal
Election Committee the full amount of its ultimate payment.
   But FEC officials said the disputed bill should have been
reported as a contested debt, citing agency regulations requiring
prompt reporting of all debts and an agency advisory opinion saying
a disputed claim must be reported as a debt until paid or resolved.
   Rozet said it was a business negotiation, based on the
possibility that there had been overbilling and on the fact that
the Jackson campaign was good business for the hotel.
   If a gift, it would be an illegal contribution either by Rozet,
who as an individual donor could give no more than $1,000 to a
candidate, or by any of his companies. Corporations are prohibited
from making political contributions in federal elections.
   In any event, Federal Election Commission reports filed by the
Jackson campaign show only the $45,500 payment to the hotel.
Campaign finance laws require candidates to promptly report all
debts in excess of $500 and all settlements for less than the
initial bill amount.
   The FEC, which is in the process of auditing the 1988 Jackson
campaign, refuses as a general practice to say whether any matter
is under investigation. The hotel billing was first publicly
disclosed Friday in The Washington Post.
   ``The campaign reaffirms that, to the best of its knowledge, it
has always operated both within the spirit and letter of federal
election laws,'' the campaign said in a statement read by Jackson
aide Frank Watkins. ``Based on the information available to us, all
legitimate campaign bills involving the Hollywood Roosevelt hotel
have been paid for in full.''
   Jackon himself was traveling and unavailble for comment. He told
The Post he was not involved in the negotiations with the hotel but
did not believe Rozet or his company had paid campaign expenses.
   ``Absolutely not,'' Jackson said. ``First off, we didn't need
that kind of favor and, second, it would have been illegal.''
   Rozet, in a telephone interview Friday, said he had no role in
the debt settlement. Asked about comments in The Post account by
two unnamed former hotel employers who termed the settlement a
``gift,'' Rozet said:
   ``That is totally untrue. If we were trying to hide it why did
we bill him in the first place?''
   Rozet said hotel managers contacted him when initial efforts to
collect the bill were unsuccessful. Rozet said he referred the
managers back to the Jackson campaign and that one hotel employee
was sent to Jackson campaign headquarters to collect the bill.
   ``My understanding of it was that there was some question as to
whether some of the Jackson people, including traveling press and
security people, had been billed the top rate when they should have
been billed at a group rate,'' Rozet said. ``The fact is that the
hotel had its best business when Jackson was there, with higher
than normal occupancy. When someone brings in that kind of
business, we'll negotiate with them. That's not unusual. We do if
for conventions and other major events.''
   The Post quoted an unnamed former hotel employee who said he
tried to get the campaign to pay the bills but a Jackson aide
``looked at me and said, `Didn't Mr. Rozet talk to you. It's all
been taken care of.'''
   Rozet, a longtime Jackson ally and prominent Democratic
fund-raiser, said he has paid for Jackson stays at the hotel in the
past, but said all predated the 1988 campaign and were for
non-political events, including a 1987 birthday party Rozet threw
for Jackson.
   The general manager of the hotel, Bruno Fava, said Friday of the
Jackson campaign, ``They have no billing troubles. ... I'm sorry
but I have no comment otherwise.''
   As for the failure to report the initial debt or the settlement
to the Federal Election Commission, James Hewitt, a Cleveland
attorney for the Jackson campaign, conceded the debt should have
been reported.
   ``It should have been listed as debt,'' he told The Post,
declining further comment. Hewitt did not immediately return
telephone calls Friday.

   The nation's largest senior citizen group on
Friday opposed proposals to cut Social Security taxes, saying the
system's mounting reserves will be needed to ensure full benefits
for future generations.
   The American Association of Retired Persons had been courted by
both fans and foes of Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan's proposal to
cut the payroll tax that finances Social Security benefits.
   AARP President Louise Crooks said the association was
``concerned with the potential loss of $55 billion or more in
annual revenue if the Social Security payroll tax is rolled back.''
   ``The association's first preference remains retaining existing
Social Security policy to continue to build the reserves for future
generations,'' she said.
   The policy was adopted by the AARP's six-member executive
committee, acting on a recommendation from its 32-member
legislative council.
   Moynihan, a New York Democrat, is concerned that Social
Security's growing trust fund reserves are being used to mask the
true size of the federal deficit and to pay for other government
programs.
   His solution is to halt the buildup of the reserves and to
return Social Security to a pay-as-you-go system in which taxes
would be raised in the next century to finance retirement benefits
for the Baby Boomers.
   Mrs. Crooks said that while there are legitimate concerns about
how the Social Security trust funds are being used, AARP ``is not
prepared to give up on the effort to bring down the federal
budget's operating deficit.''
   The group was careful to credit Moynihan, widely respected as an
advocate for Social Security, for drawing attention to the problem.
   ``Americans of all ages are indebted to Senator Moynihan for
sparking the debate on the federal deficit and the future of Social
Security,'' Mrs. Crooks said. ``Senator Moynihan has correctly and
dramatically defined the problem.''
   AARP said that if the budget accounting problem cannot be
resolved ``in a reasonable amount of time, then adoption of
pay-as-you-go financing for Social Security will have to be
seriously considered.''
   Moynihan thanked the AARP for its ``careful consideration'' of
his proposal and said the group is in ``complete agreement'' with
him that the current budget accounting system is inadequate.
   ``What we absolutely agree upon is that the trust funds can no

   AARP, with 31 million members aged 50 and over, is considered
the most powerful organization among advocacy groups for the
elderly. Other advocacy groups also have voiced concern about the
Moynihan proposal.

   FBI agents will remain in a southeastern
Alabama county for the foreseeable future as they investigate the
mail bombings that killed a federal judge and a civil rights
attorney, a spokesman said Friday.
   Scores of federal agents have been in Enterprise since Jan. 22.
Robert Wayne O'Ferrell, an area salvage store owner, has been
questioned several times and has given the FBI hair, blood and
saliva samples. He has not been charged.
   The FBI has collected other evidence in the area, and on Friday
continued to search for a typewriter believed to have been used to
write a letter from a person or group calling itself Americans for
a Competent Federal Judicial System, which claimed responsibility
for the December bombings.
   ``I don't think we're at the end of it,'' said Doug Marshall, an
FBI spokesman in Mobile. ``I don't see any plans to end it at this
point.''
   Marshall would not say if investigators are satisfied with the
evidence uncovered so far. ``We're not at the point where we can
say anything evaluative like that,'' he said
   Meanwhile, postal inspectors investigating the mailing of a fake
bomb to an NAACP branch in Pennsylvania believe it was sent by
someone nearby.
   ``We think it might have been sent locally by some
less-than-rocket-scientist-type people,'' Inspector Dick Balya
said. ``People who do things like this usually aren't too bright.''
   Pittsburgh police on Jan. 19 blew up what appeared to be a mail
bomb received by the Washington County branch of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
   O'Ferrell's attorneys have asked the FBI to provide them with a
case file of their client. Lawyer Anthony Bishop said Friday the
FBI has notified him that the documents have been prepared and that
he would meet with O'Ferrell when he gets them.
   The mail bombs killed U.S. Circuit Judge Robert S. Vance of
Birmingham and civil rights attorney Robert Robinson of Savannah,
Ga. Bombs were also mailed to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Atlanta and to the NAACP headquarters in Jacksonville,
Fla., but did not explode.
   Vance, who served on the 11th Circuit, was to be remembered
Monday with a memorial service in Atlanta that is to include an
address by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy.

   President F.W. de Klerk legalized
the African National Congress on Friday and promised to free Nelson
Mandela, a historic concession to the epic struggle for freedom by
the nation's black majority.
   Thousands of blacks thronged the streets of several cities to
celebrate the announcements by de Klerk in a 40-minute speech that
was widely hailed as courageous.
   But black activists and several countries said despite the move
to legalize the ANC and dozens of other anti-apartheid groups, the
white-run government must now follow through. De Klerk did not act
to dismantle the foundation of the apartheid system that would give
South Africa's 28 million blacks a direct voice in running the
country.
   Activists, white businessmen, liberal politicians and foreign
governments praised the courage of de Klerk, who scrapped many
other restrictions on opposition activity in a bid to draw the ANC
into negotiations on South Africa's future.
   ``It's incredible. What he said has certainly taken my breath
away,'' said Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, winner of the 1984
Nobel Peace Prize for his opposition to apartheid. ``We could say
that we are probably seeing history in the making in South Africa.''
   President Bush called the move ``quite positive'' and said he
will review U.S. sanctions on South Africa. An aide said de Klerk
and Mandela will be invited to the White House when the black
leader is released.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain described de Klerk's
announcement as ``a historic landmark'' and lifted cultural and
academic embargoes.
   The exiled ANC said de Klerk's announcements ``go a long way to
creating the climate conducive to negotiations.'' But the
Zambia-based organization, which has been fighting a guerrilla war
almost 30 years, said more changes were needed before talks could
begin.
   If the two sides begin negotiations, quick breakthroughs appear
unlikely.
   The ANC and all leading anti-apartheid groups demand a
one-person, one-vote democracy, which de Klerk opposes, saying it
will result in the 28 million blacks dominating the 5 million
whites. Another three million people of mixed race and 850,000
Asian and Indians make up the 37 million South Africans.
   De Klerk, since taking office in August, has said he envisions
some type of system in which no single racial group would dominate.
   Mandela, 71, the country's best-known black leader, would be
freed shortly, de Klerk said. But he said ``personal circumstances
and safety'' were among the factors delaying the release.
   ``I want to put it plainly that the government has decided to
release Nelson Mandela unconditionally,'' he said. ``Unfortunately,
a further short passage of time is unavoidable.''
   Tutu agreed with de Klerk's assessment, saying ``there may be
people, a lunatic fringe, who would want to subvert the process by
liquidating him. I think that we have to accept that there are
certain constraints.''
   De Klerk said he would lift bans on more than 30 outlawed groups
and scrap restrictions on a similar number. He pledged to free most
prisoners jailed for belonging to these groups, declared a
moratorium on executions, and lifted most of the restrictions
imposed during a 43-month-old state of emergency.
   These were the principal steps demanded by Mandela and the ANC
as conditions for negotiations on a new constitution that would end
the black majority's exclusion from national politics.
   ``The season of violence is over. The time for reconstruction
and reconciliation has arrived,'' de Klerk said in his speech,
greeted with cheers from supporters and silence from the right-wing
opposition.
   De Klerk said his Cabinet unanimously agreed on the decision and
the action on legalizing the groups requires no action from
Parliament or any other branch of government.
   Andries Treurnicht, leader of the pro-apartheid Conservative
Party, challenged de Klerk to call an immediate election for white
voters to see whether they backed his decisions.
   ``We say he has no mandate for doing the drastic things he
intends doing,'' Treurnicht said.
   At the perimeter of the parliamentary buildings, about 5,000
demonstrators, many chanting ``ANC! ANC!'' joined a march demanding
Mandela's release.
   In Cape Town, Johannesburg and Durban, the three largest cities,
thousands of blacks sang and danced in the streets to celebrate the
ANC's legalization.
   Police said marchers threw stones at them in Johannesburg and
ordered the crowd to disperse. They then fired tear gas. No arrests
or serious injuries were reported.
   The groups to be legalized, in addition to the ANC, include the
smaller Pan Africanist Congress guerrilla movement, the South
African Communist Party and the United Democratic Front, a
nationwide anti-apartheid coalition.
   The United Democratic Front, which is aligned with the ANC,
welcomed de Klerk's changes but called for sanctions to remain in
place.
   ``To lift sanctions now would be to run the risk of aborting the
process to democracy,'' it said in a statement.
   De Klerk said he was lifting restrictions imposed on 374
activists following their release from detention.
   He said state-of-emergency detentions would be limited to a
maximum of six months and emergency restrictions on the media would
be scrapped except for some unspecified controls over photographic
and television coverage of unrest.
   Mandela, 71, has been jailed since 1962 and is serving a life
sentence for helping plan the start of the ANC's sabotage and
bombing campaign. He has met with de Klerk, other government
officials and anti-apartheid leaders over the past several months
in talks aimed at clearing the way for negotiations.
   The ANC was outlawed in 1960 after 48 years of non-violent
campaigning for black rights. In 1961, it launched its sabotage
campaign.
   In the past year, the guerrilla campaign has subsided markedly.
The ANC's exiled leadership has acknowledged that its military
options were limited and that it favored negotiations if de Klerk
was willing to allow unrestricted black political activity.
   ``The allegation has been that the government did not wish to
talk to them (the ANC and the Pan Africanist Congress) and that
they are deprived of their right to normal political activity,'' de
Klerk said.
   ``The unconditional lifting of the prohibition ... places
everybody in a position to pursue politics freely,'' he added.
``The justification for violence, which was always advanced, no
longer exists.''

   Romania has asked for judicial help in
trying to recover wealth allegedly stashed in Swiss banks by
deposed and executed Communist leader Nicolae Ceausescu, Swiss
authorities said Friday.
   Justice Ministry spokesman Joerg Kistler said the request from
Bucharest cited charges against Ceausescu of genocide and misuse of
office as grounds for recovering the funds.
   Kistler gave no indication of how much was involved. Romanian
newspapers have alleged Ceausescu had $400 million in Swiss banks,
much of it in gold bullion.
   The Swiss government slapped a precautionary freeze Dec. 22 on
any assets held by Ceausescu or his associates, pending receipt of
the official request for legal aid from the interim Romanian
government.
   Kistler said the request will be passed to authorities in states
where the funds are purportedly stashed.

   Todor Zhivkov, dismissed as Communist
Party chief and under arrest on corruption charges, has been
transferred to a hospital for an unspecified illness, state radio
and television reported Friday.
   Zhivkov, 78, is in investigative custody, accused of malfeasance
in office, misappropriation of state property and other crimes.
   Television showed Zhivkov sitting in a room, his head bowed low,
and walking downstairs with the aid of two men in civilian clothes.
It then showed a militia car driving away, with Zhivkov apparently
inside.
   The pictures were believed to be the first broadcast of the
former leader since he was ousted Nov. 10 after 35 years in power.
   Friday's radio broadcast said Zhivkov's health condition was so
bad he could not remain in prison and was moved to a hospital.
   The nature of the illness and the date of the transfer were not
reported, and the hospital was not identified.
   Communist Party officials, commenting at the end of an emergency
party congress, said Zhivkov had ``certain old age ailments'' and
was under constant supervision by physicians.
   Andrei Lukanov, a senior Communist Party leader, also said ``it
is obvious that Zhivkov will stand trial when the investigation
(against him) yields categorical evidence of his guilt under the
laws of this country.''
   Earlier in the week, it was reported that Zhivkov had been moved
from house arrest in a villa to a prison.
   Friday's broadcast said Bulgarian leaders are appealing to
Western governments to establish whether Zhivkov or his family ever
deposited money in their banks.
   Zhivkov was toppled on Nov. 10 after 35 years in office.
   Investigations are also under way against two of Zhivkov's
aides, son-in-law Ivan Slavkov and Milko Balev, a Politburo member
under Zhivkov.

   Federal regulators on Friday sold the
insolvent Bright Banc Savings Association of Dallas to an Ohio bank
holding company in the largest thrift sale since enactment of the
S&amp;L bailout law in August.
   Banc One Corp. of Columbus, Ohio, is receiving $1.1 billion in
government assistance to acquire Bright Banc, founded in the early
1980s by H.R. ``Bum'' Bright, once one of the 50 wealthiest men in
the country and the former owner of the Dallas Cowboys football
team. Banc One is paying $45 million.
   Bright Banc, with $3.1 billion in assets, is the biggest failed
thrift in Texas and the largest yet sold by the Resolution Trust
Corp.
   The deal is one of the first in which the RTC has persuaded the
buyer to take a substantial portion of the thrift's loans and other
assets. Banc One is getting $1.7 billion of the S&amp;L's assets,
including residential mortgages, consumer loans, cash and
securities.
   The RTC is keeping $1.4 billion in assets, mostly sour loans and
repossessed real estate. After it sells the assets, it estimates
the government's total loss on the institution will be $1.4
billion, including the $1.1 billion paid to the Ohio company.
   RTC officials had promised a major sale after undergoing a
tongue-lashing earlier this week from members of the Senate Banking
Committee upset with the slow pace of the administration's S&amp;L
cleanup.
   The agency has taken over more than 350 failed thrifts,
disposing of 43 of them. But, in most of the transactions it has
simply transferred the failed institutions' deposits to the new
owner and retained the assets for later sale.
   Bank One Texas, a unit of the Ohio holding company, is assuming
all $2.6 billion of Bright Banc's deposits in 250,000 accounts. The
thrift's 48 offices will remain open during their usual business
hours.
   The acquisition gives Bank One Texas a formidable retail network
in Texas. It would add Bright Banc's branches to the 63 it
currently operates and create a combined institution with about $14
billion in assets, among the 25 largest banking operations in the
nation.

<HEAD>New Bulgarian Party Leader Says Party Must Regain Confidence</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Bulgaria</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alexander Lilov, the new chief of the
Bulgarian Communist Party, is a reformer who advocates open and
truthful news media and who is reputed to have devised a new more
liberal policy for the country's 1.5 million ethnic Turks.
   Lilov, 56, emerged as the new party leader on Friday after an
emergency overnight session of the Communist Party, replacing Petar
Mladenov, who remains in the newly separated post of state
president.
   Lilov is a party veteran who was shunted aside under longtime
party leader Todor Zhivkov, himself ousted last November. He has
said he recognizes the need for the party to be revamped before it
faces multiparty elections in May.
   ``The Bulgarian Communist Party should adopt the tactic of more
businesslike work in order to regain confidence and to fulfill the
hard tasks which it has to solve,'' Lilov told delegates after his
election.
   Lilov must still convince a growing opposition, and an
increasingly skeptical general public, that he is serious about
reform and capable of enacting significant changes.
   At a news conference when he was voted into the ruling Politburo
in December, Lilov charged that the legacy of Zhivkov's 35-year
regime was a ``degradation of party principles and ethics.''
   ``The most important question to ask is why the system breeds
dictators and why it tolerates them for so long,'' he said.
   That news conference gave an indication of Lilov's stand on
reforms and his potential as an emerging leader in the party after
Zhivkov had kept him from the power center for six years.
   ``We have no illusions that if socialist society fails to
restructure it will not be able to emerge from the crisis,'' Lilov
said.
   He also advocated a more open information policy, including
permission for ordinary people to speak up.
   ``We need to destroy the information monopoly (and) ensure
genuine openness of mass media so it could report on developments
in an objective way and give ... all Bulgarian nationals a chance
to speak,'' Lilov said in December.
   It was Lilov's reformist views and criticism of the former
Communist strongman, now in jail, that led to his dismissal from
the Politburo in 1983.
   After Zhivkov's ouster, Lilov made a spectacular comeback.
Informed sources said he was in charge of Bulgaria's new policy on
its Turkish minority.
   Bulgaria recently reversed an assimilation campaign vigorously
imposed by Zhivkov. Last month the leadership announced that those
who fled to neighboring Turkey were now free to return to home and
reclaim their property.
   About 300,000 ethnic Turks emigrated to Turkey the past two
years to escape persecution and harassement in Bulgaria. About
50,000 later returned.
   ``We are well aware the matter is acute and part of the current
crisis,'' Lilov said in December.
   He was one of the first Communist leaders to publicly advocate
the rights of the minorities regardless of their ethnic identity or
religious beliefs, based on provisions in international human
rights commitments.
   Born in 1933 in a village in northwestern Bulgaria, Lilov holds
a doctorate in Bulgarian language and literature, after
philological studies in Sofia and Moscow.
   After work in the Communist youth union in the late 1940s, Lilov
became involved in local party organizations, In 1972, he became a
Central Committee member and secretary responsible for art and
culture.
   Lilov was named a Politburo member in 1974, in charge of
ideology and culture. But he was dismissed from the ruling body and
as a Central Committee secretary in 1983 after he clashed with
Zhivkov over the personality cult surrounding the party chief and
other issues.
   Lilov was director of the Institute of Contemporary Social
Theories in Sofia from 1985 until his December rehabilitation.

   Foreign Minister Julio Linares said
Friday that U.S. invasion troops should leave when public order is
assured, although many Panamanians don't believe that will be by
the end of this month.
   His remarks were the first by a government official here since
President Bush said in his State of the Union address Wednesday the
troops would be out ``well before the end of February.''
   Linares told reporters the troops ``should withdraw when we have
the ability to maintain public order.''
   Nearly 3,000 remaining U.S. invasion soldiers are expected to go
home within the next few weeks, but at least 13,000 will remain as
part of the regular soldiers stationed at U.S. Southern Command
bases under terms of the 1977 Panama Canal Treaties.
   The United States invaded Panama on Dec. 20 to overthrow Manuel
Antonio Noriega, who faces drugs charges in Miami.
   Maj. Gen. Marc Cisneros, commander of the the U.S. Army South,
the U.S. ground forces in Panama, told a group of Latin American
observers Thursday, ``There is no threat of subversion to worry
about.''
   Others here are not that sure.
   Schoolteacher Victoria Jimenez said, ``The Americans should stay
longer. If they leave, there could be a coup.''
   ``We want them to stay until they can train our new police
force,'' said a government official, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``I think this may be premature.''
   Last week Vice President Ricardo Arias Calderon said publicly
the U.S. soldiers would leave ``when the country is secure.''
   One newspaper Friday greeted the announcement that U.S. troops
moved from Delta Alert to Charlie Alert, allowing them to leave
bases and visit Panama City, with the headline: ``13,000 soldiers
will make their purchases here.''
   Original estimates were that invasion forces would remain four
to five weeks after overthrowing Noreiga.
   It was soon evident this was optimistic. The government
abolished the old Defense Forces, the only armed authority in
Panama, and asked the U.S. Army to act as policeman.
   The U.S. Army became in effect a police force for the Panamanian
government. While U.S. forces guarded prisoners at military bases,
the new police force was being trained.
   ``I don't want them to leave in February or ever,'' said
mechanic Adrian Rubio, 42. ``What we should do is lease them some
military bases. We need the dollars.''
   ``Cisneros said they are going to stay as long as necessary, so
I believe him more than I believe Bush,'' added Ana Perez.
   Another Panamanian government official, also speaking on
condition of not being further identified, said even if the
invasion forces leave, ``the Americans will still be here at the
bases. And they can continue to train the police force.''
   ``People are afraid of going out at ngiht because of the
criminal elements loose,'' said Mrs. Jimenez. ``The Americans
should stay here longer.''
   This week two battalions of American infantry were in the Darien
jungle near the Colombian border searching for remnants of
Noriega's loyalists or criminals.
   ``We will stay here as long as the Panamanian government feels
we are needed,'' Cisneros said in a recent interview.
   Last Sunday, when Vice Presdient Dan Quayle attended Mass with
President Guillermo Endara, parishioners waved signs that read:
``Americans, do not go home.''

   President Bush welcomed as ``quite
positive'' South Africa's announcement Friday that Nelson Mandela
would be freed and said he would talk with Congress about the
possibility of lifting U.S. economic sanctions.
   Yet Bush indicated any easing would depend on South Africa
making good on its promise to free Mandela, the leader of a
formerly outlawed guerrilla movement, and taking additional steps.
   Members of Congress took similar or tougher stances, with some
urging Bush to keep U.S. sanctions in place. They noted that South
Africa's system of racial apartheid is still intact.
   ``The sanctions should be maintained in full force. This is no
time to relax them,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
   ``Apartheid is crumbling as the Berlin Wall crumbled only a few
months ago,'' Kennedy said, attributing changes in the South
African government's positions to pressure brought by the economic
sanctions as well as to persistence of South African blacks.
   The U.S. sanctions include a ban on importing South African
steel, textiles, uranium, coal and agricultural produce. They also
bar new U.S. investment in South Africa, forbid new bank loans and
end U.S. landing rights for South African Airways.
   Kennedy and others also said Bush should shelve his offer to
invite South African President F.W. de Klerk to the White House
once Mandela is freed.
   ``I urge caution before that step is taken,'' said Sen. Paul
Simon, D-Ill., chairman of a Senate subcommittee on Africa. ``State
visits involving South Africa have been ruled out by past
administrations as long as we continue to have fundamental
differences with the South African government.''
   Kennedy said simply that de Klerk ``still represents one of the
most abhorrent systems'' in the world.
   Bush also has announced he will invite Mandela to the White
House after he is freed.
   In a speech to the South African parliament, de Klerk legalized
the African National Congress after three decades of guerrilla war
against white rule. He said Mandela, the ANC leader who was
imprisoned in 1962, would be freed, but not immediately.
   In addition, de Klerk said he would lift bans or restrictions on
more than 60 other opposition groups, free most prisoners jailed
for belonging to these groups, declare a moratorium on executions,
and scrap most of the restrictions imposed during more than three
years of a state of emergency.
   Bush commented on the developments on Air Force One en route to
appearances in Raleigh, N.C., and Knoxville, Tenn.
   ``Very interesting and I would say quite positive,'' the
president said. ... I view it positively and I think most people
around the world will.''
   Bush said that de Klerk ``recognizes the status quo is not
acceptable to him or to the people in South Africa and to a lot of
people in the world who want to see a more just society.''
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said ``a lot of
conditions'' have to be met before Bush would seek the removal of
sanctions. ``There's still a lot to be done before that happens.''
   Stil, Bush said, ``I think when people move in the right
direction, it is certainly time to review all policy.''
   ``We want to see the policy initiatives go forward and the
release of Mandela,'' he said. But he added, ``I am one who has not
favored additional sanctions so I'm perfectly willing to review
things as new developments take place,'' he added.
   Rep. Bill Gray, D-Pa., also welcomed the South African
developments but noted that a series of conditions in connection
with the sanctions remain unmet: releasing all political prisoners,
lifting the state of emergency, legalizing political participation
for all parties, repealing laws that regulate where non-whites can
live and work, and beginning good-faith negotiations with the black
majority.
   ``All are essential in ending apartheid and restoring justice,''
Gray said.
   The president can suspend or modify U.S. sanctions if Mandela
and other political prisoners are released and Pretoria meets at
least three of the other conditions.
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., former chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, called de Klerk's actions a ``bold
stroke for freedom,'' and added: ``The trend in events is South
Africa has been a strong one toward negotiation.''
   Lugar said the U.S. sanctions bill gives the president
flexibility to remove some sanctions if South Africa meets certain
conditions. But Lugar said Bush has promised to consult with
Congress before he takes any action.
   In Washington, the Rev. Jesse Jackson said ``we must balance
hope with caution. Caution because the structure of apartheid is
still in place and Nelson Mandela is still in jail.''
   While de Klerk's announcement is a historic change in government
policy, it makes no immediate change in the system of apartheid
that establishes a racially segregated society in which the 28
million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million
whites continue to control the economy and maintain separate
districts, schools and health services.

   Soviet Jews and immigration activists expressed
alarm Friday over possible anti-Jewish violence in the Soviet Union
and urged Israel to act quickly before it's too late.
   ``We don't sleep, we live in fear. ... Emigration invitations
from Israel are our only hope,'' Polina Mendelevitch, an attorney
from Leningrad, said on Israel radio in a telephone interview
Thursday night.
   Immigration officials say close to 1 million Soviet Jews have
received such invitations, needed to start emigration procedures.
   Israel expects up to 100,000 immigrants to arrive in the next 12
months. Last year, 12,000 Soviet Jews came here, more than five
times the 1988 number.
   Soviet Jews complained of anti-Semitic incidents and
demonstrations.
   In mid-January, nationalist activists broke into a Moscow
gathering of writers, shouting anti-Semitic slogans and causing a
scuffle, a Soviet Television report monitored in Israel said.
   ``The city prosecutor appeared on the TV, saying they needed to
look into the incident,'' Ms. Mendelevitch said. ``But these thugs
were not punished, they found no criminal element in their
actions.''
   Later, a frightened Jewish author called friends in Israel,
asking for an emigration invitation to be sent to him as soon as
possible.
   On Jan. 27, Soviet TV broadcast a report that said members of
the Russian nationalist group Pamyat, or Memory, at a recent rally
in Moscow openly called for a Jewish pogrom on May 5.
   Another TV report monitored in Israel this week said city
officials in Odessa, a Black Sea port with a significant Jewish
population, met in emergency session to discuss rising nationalism
there.
   Pamyat leaders in Leningrad reportedly collect Jewish addresses
as a membership requirement, Soviet Jewish immigrants say.
   Israel radio on Friday quoted Mavrik Wolfson of Riga, a Jewish
member of the Supreme Soviet, as demanding a Soviet government
response to reports that Russian nationalist groups plan to carry
out a Jewish pogrom, and steps to protect the Jews.
   Yuri Stern, a Soviet immigration activist who acts as an adviser
to the Israeli Parliament's Immigration and Absorption Committee,
on Friday warned that ``the situation in the Soviet Union is such
that the fact we still have not witnessed large-scale pogroms is
simply a miracle.''
   ``We have to do the maximum to allow for the exodus of Soviet
Jews, to use all the available transportation means, to speed up
all the processes that largely depend on us ... Who knows how much
time we have?''
   Immigration activists asked the government to speed up the
process of issuing invitations and explore possible routes for
immigrants. They say as many as 50,000 to 100,000 Soviet Jews who
have received exit visas cannot leave because of ticket shortages.
   Soviet immigrants now arrive through Hungary and Romania, but
airplane tickets are in short supply, reports from the Soviet Union
say.
   The Soviets are reluctant to approve their direct flights
agreement with Israel. They are faced with strong Arab and
Palestinian protests over the influx of immigrants to Israel and
remarks by the Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel suggesting
the immigrants would be settled in the occupied lands.
   Last week, the Kremlin registered an official protest with the
Jewish state. Israel said in response it has no policy of directing
immigrants to the occupied territories.
   At U.N. Headquarters in New York on Friday, the Soviet Union and
the League of Arab States expressed concern over the likely
settlement of immigrating Soviet Jews in the occupied lands,
calling it a threat to Middle East peace.
   ``We are firmly against the use, at risk to their safety, of
persons leaving the U.S.S.R. to force Palestinians off land that
belongs to them,'' said Moscow's acting U.N. Ambassador Valentin V.
Lozinskiy in a letter to the secretary-general.
   ``The Israeli leadership must realize the dangrous consequences
of such action on its part.''
   The 22-nation Arab League expressed concern at an urgent meeting
Friday that Soviet-Jewish immigration to Israel will spill over to
augment the ``illegal'' settlements in the occupied territories.
   In Tunis, Tunisia, Arab League Secretary General Chedli Klibi
said a ``historic catastrophe'' could result if the Soviet Union
allows large numbers of Jews to emigrate to Israel, League sources
said without elaborating.
   In two hours of talks Friday with Soviet Vice Minister of
Foreign Affairs Gennadi Tarassov, Klibi insisted that the Soviet
Union reverse its Jewish emigration policy.

   A mild-mannered ex-minister suspected of bombing a
bank and carrying out 20 other bank robberies and burglaries in the
past year led a double life, according to relatives and the FBI.
   ``He was loved by everybody in the community,'' said Sherry
Jones after her husband, Edward, was arrested in the case. ``I
mean, there's not a person, including myself, who would have ever
dreamed he'd be capable of this.''
   Jones, 50, was arrested Monday and charged with the botched
attempt to blow open a safe at American Industrial Bank of Cherry
Creek on Jan. 10. A homemade pipe bomb used in the attempt singed
the carpet and blew a few holes in the ceiling.
   He also is suspected in as many as 20 more robberies and
burglaries in Colorado, said Bob Pence, head of the Denver FBI
office.
   An ordained minister who graduated from the Conservative Baptist
Theological Seminary in Denver, Jones hadn't preached for several
years. Jones most recently worked for a furniture manufacturer,
American Seating Inc. of Wheat Ridge.
   Neighbors described him as an avid tennis player who frequently
worked out at a health club.
   But Mrs. Jones said her husband began showing signs of trouble a
few weeks ago. On Jan. 23, she called Lakewood police because she
was concerned about her husband's emotional stability, said police
spokesman John Hunt. Jones was taken to a hospital for psychiatric
evaluation.
   On Jan. 23, the family's doctor called Lakewood police and
suggested Ed Jones be given a psychiatric evaluation, said police
spokesman John Hunt. At that time, Mrs. Jones told officers she was
worried about her husband's emotional state, Hunt said.
   She said he had ``changed dramatically,'' becoming ``more
secretive'' and more stressful about credit and financial
pressures, for example, police records show.
   Jones agreed to be taken to a hospital for psychiatric
evaluation, Hunt said, and an hour later his wife called police
again to alert them to ``some things that might be of interest to
you and also might show that he's having some problems with
coping,'' Hunt said.
   About an hour later, his wife called police again to alert them
to ``some things that might be of interest to you and also might
show that he's having some problems with coping,'' Hunt said.
   Wigs, fake mustaches, masks, a handgun, various tools, nylons, a
trench coat, assorted keys and a stolen federal government license
plate were in the trunk of the couple's car. The items were turned
over to the FBI, Hunt said.
   Two of the keys found were from the American Industrial Bank,
FBI documents show. Also in the trunk was an apparent sketch of a
bomb and a safe, FBI documents show, as well as an apparent
checklist referring to appearance, alarms, tools and a safe.
   FBI agents also searched a condominium Jones used two miles west
of his home and uncovered a cache of masks, fake beards, weapons
and materials used to make pipe bombs, Pence said.
   Jones was held without bond at the Federal Detention Center in
southern Jefferson County.
   Pence said Jones' family was unaware of his alleged criminal
activities or of the condominium he maintained.
   Mrs. Jones, who works at a downtown Denver bank, said her
husband gave every appearence of being a mellow, polite, respectful
and law-abiding citizen.
   ``He had a double life,'' she said. ``We had no financial
problems. He just was doing so many things on the side. ... He was
a very sick man. What he did just doesn't make a lot of sense.''
   She said her husband participated in school events for their two
teen-age children.
   Neighbors, too, were stunned by the arrest.
   ``That would be the last guy in the world that I would ever
think of doing something like that,'' said one neighbor who
declined to be identified.

   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher said Friday he and Secretary of State James A. Baker
agreed that unification of Germany would not mean extending NATO's
military area eastward.
   Dramatizing the rush of developments on the issue of unifying
East and West Germany, Genscher crossed the Atlantic Friday for
consultations with Baker before the secretary's meetings next week
with Soviet leaders in Moscow. He was returning during the night to
Bonn.
   ``We were in full agreement that there is no intention to extend
the NATO area of defensive security toward the East,'' Genscher
said after their 2{-hour meeting at the State Department.
   ``That holds true for not only the (East) German Democratic
Republic, which we have no intention of simply incorporating, but
also for the other Eastern countries,'' he added to reporters in
the State Department lobby as Baker stood beside him.
   Genscher's blitz visit, arranged earlier this week, followed
close on the heels of a surprise call by East German Prime Minister
Hans Modrow for a single, militarily neutral German state.
   Baker indirectly rejected the idea of neutrality for a future
united Germany by telling reporters that ``I'm frankly encouraged''
by what Genscher has said about continued German membership in NATO.
   The German minister's statement about not extending the alliance
eastward appeared to mean that such membership would cover only the
Western part of a unified Germany.
   Baker also said ``we agreed we need to develop a process and a
framework for (unification) ... taking into consideration the
interests of all who are involved in the issue.''
   The two ministers also said the 35-nation summit proposed for
late 1990 by Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev should include not
only formal signing of an agreement on reduction of ground forces
in Europe but also add free elections to the basic human rights
enumerated at the original 35-nation Helsinki summit in 1975 on
security and cooperation in Europe.
   Baker said he and Genscher agreed ``that any such summit should
involve the inclusion of the right of free elections as an
additional human right in the human rights basket of CSCE.''
   German unity appeared to be a major issue Baker will take up
with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze during their
talks in Moscow next Thursday and Friday. He also will see
Gorbachev, who on Wednesday softened long-standing Soviet
opposition to German reunification.
   Genscher, meanwhile, is consulting with British and French
officials as well as Baker.
   Modrow's plan is for a neutral single German state that would
belong neither to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization nor to the
Warsaw Pact. Genscher has proposed that Germany would be a NATO
member but that the portion that is now East Germany would be a
neutral military zone.
   Genscher has joined West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in
rejecting neutrality for a future German state.
   ``The meeting with Baker was not scheduled because of the latest
developments in East Germany,'' a U.S. official said. ``The idea
was to meet with Baker before his talks in Moscow.''
   And yet, the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the session was ``in context with fast-moving events.''
   Genscher suggested the meeting last week.
   A West German embassy official said, meanwhile, that Genscher
wanted ``to coordinate various positions'' with Baker before his
trip to Moscow. Baker leaves Monday night, stopping first in
Prague, Czechoslovakia.
   The embassy official, who barred use of his name, said Genscher
also wanted to discuss with Baker the latest U.S. proposal to
reduce U.S. and Soviet troops in Europe to 225,000 each, with a
limit of 195,000 in Central Europe _ meaning West and East Germany
and Czechoslovakia.

   President Bush, pointing to concerns the
United States is in danger of being dethroned as the ``world
champion'' of science and technology, urged Congress on Friday to
swiftly approve his plan to boost spending on research and
development.
   Bush went on the road to tout his plans to spend $71 billion on
science and technology in fiscal 1991, and to respond to criticism
that his education budget _ a proposed 2 percent increase over 1990
_ is insufficient to improve performance in the nation's schools.
The $71 billion is $4.5 billion more than the money enacted for
1990, according to White House figures.
   During his visit to two universities in Tennessee and North
Carolina, the president toured a semiconductor lab he termed
``awesome,'' and stood in a pitch-dark room for several minutes
attempting to see an experiment involving microorganisms that
control chemical pollution in contaminated water and soil.
   ``In science and technology, the United States is today the
undisputed heavyweight champion of the world,'' he told an audience
at the University of Tennessee.
   ``Yet some wonder if America has lost its competitive edge and
ask if we must now look overseas for the answer,'' Bush said.
   ``The United States is the defending world champion, but we have
to defend our title day by day, week by week, year-in and
year-out,'' the president said.
   Bush urged Congress to approve his budget proposals in science,
including doubling spending for the National Science Foundation by
1993.
   ``Building America's competitive strength today also means that
we need quick congressional action on our other proposals for
investing in new capital _ intellectual capital,'' he said.
   In answer to questions from students about federal funding for
education, however, Bush stressed that in terms of spending ``I
still believe a lot of the emphasis has to be at the local and
state level.''
   Bush announced Friday he was creating a 15-member committee,
headed by White House science adviser Allan Bromley and including
14 private-sector members, to advise him on ``all areas of science
and technology.'' No names of members were released.
   The White House also announced Bush on Monday will address the
opening session of a United Nations group that is working on the
global warming issue. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
will meet at Georgetown University in Washington.
   Bush has been criticized for not taking a leadership role on
global warming. The announcement Friday came after more than 700
scientists, representing more than a third of all members of the
National Academy of Sciences, accused him of being complacent about
the global warming threat.
   Before arriving in Knoxville, Bush toured a North Carolina State
University lab that studies semiconductor surfaces.
   ``All this brainwork out here, it's a little awesome,'' the
president said.
   Bush participated in a discussion with a handful of technology
company executives about their efforts to work with educational
institutions on research projects.
   Several stressed the need to put more emphasis on science and
math education before students reach college.
   ``We simply can't wait for the schools to improve. Business must
take an active role,'' said Richard Daugherty of International
Business Machines Corp., who said IBM spends $900 million a year to
educate its own employees. ``We need emphasis on math and science.''
   ``The improvement of education is fundamental to
competitiveness,'' Daugherty said.
   Bush has come under attack for proposing an increase of only 2
percent _ $500 million _ in the education budget for 1991 even as
he announced national education goals of improved math and science
achievement, literacy and drug-free schools.
   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos, accompanying Bush on Friday,
reiterated his argument that the proposed $24.6 billion budget for
fiscal 1991 ``is the largest budget we've ever had.''
   Bush proposes a 69 percent increase, to $230 million, in the
Dwight D. Eisenhower Mathematics and Science Program. The money
goes to states for improved math and science teaching programs.
   Bush also took Energy Secretary James Watkins on the trip
Friday. He said the president's Domestic Policy Council of advisers
soon will give the president ``an entirely new intitiative''
dealing with interaction between students and facilties such as the
federal Oak Ridge National Laboratory near Knoxville.
   At the University of Tennessee, environmental technology
professors showed Bush a machine to develop microorganisms that can
be used in environmental cleanup.
   University President Lamar Alexander told Bush the school will
establish a Summer School of the South for Science and Mathematics
to help meet the president's goal of making U.S. students No. 1 in
science by the year 2000.
   The state, Martin Marietta Corp. and the Department of Energy
each will contribute $1 million to the Academy for Teachers of
Science and Mathematics, which provide instruction for high school
science and math teachers, Alexander said.

   An effort to retry a high school principal in
the slayings of a teacher and her two children should be rejected
because misconduct by the prosecutor, the principal's lawyer argued
Thursday.
   The principal, Jay C. Smith, was convicted in the 1979 killings
_ subject of a book and TV miniseries called ``Echoes in the
Darkness'' _ but the verdict was overturned in December by the
state Supreme Court.
   Defense attorney William Costopoulos argued in court papers that
a second trial would violate Smith's constitutional protection
against double jeopardy, or being tried twice on the same charges.
   In a 105-page motion filed in Dauphin County Court, Costopoulos
also argued the state was guilty of misconduct, alleging the
prosecutor withheld evidence from the defense. He also accused the
prosecution of using hearsay testimony that was false and using a
witness who committed perjury and then improperly freed from prison
for his cooperation.
   Robert Gentzel, a spokesman for Attorney General Ernie Preate
Jr., said state lawyers believe ``the motion is without merit and
we will vigorously oppose it.''
   Smith was convicted in 1986 of murdering Susan Reinert and her
children, Karen, 11, and Michael, 10. He was sentenced to die in
the electric chair.
   In ordering a new trial, the state Supreme Court said Dauphin
County Judge William Lipsitt erred by allowing the jury to consider
hearsay testimony.
   Costopoulos had raised the prosecutorial misconduct allegations
on appeal, but the justices didn't consider that part of the
argument once it determined the hearsay evidence was improper.
   Much of the motion focuses on two grains of sand that were
apparently found on Mrs. Reinert's feet. The material, attached to
adhesive strips used to gather evidence, was found by a state
policeman in an evidence drawer during the last week of the trial,
but Costopoulos didn't learn of their existence until nearly two
years later.
   Smith contended the sand would have bolstered his defense that
Reinert was killed by another teacher, William Bradfield, at the
New Jersey shore.
   The attorney general contended that the material may have been
planted by the defense and wouldn't have made any difference in the
jury's verdict.
   Mrs. Reinert's nude and bruised body was found in the hatchback
of her car in the parking lot of a suburban Harrisburg hotel. The
children's bodies never were found.

   Women who carry their weight around the
middle are more at risk for developing breast cancer than those who
bulge at the hips and thighs, according to a study published
Thursday.
   In a separate study, researchers said they have identified an
enzyme that may help them predict which breast cancer patients will
likely have a relapse of the disease.
   The so-called ``apple'' vs. ``pear'' study concerning fat and
breast cancer was conducted by David Schapira, an associate
professor who heads cancer prevention at H. Lee Moffitt Cancer
Center &amp; Research Institute at the University of South Florida.
   ``It's not how much weight you have on your body, but where you
have it,'' said Schapira, whose findings were published in The
Annals of Internal Medicine.
   The Florida study showed women with fat over the stomach and
abdominal area are at six times the risk of developing breast
cancer than those with fat deposits lower on the body. Schapira
called women with upper body fat patterns ``apples'' and women with
traditional lower body fat ``pears.''
   The team studied 216 breast cancer patients diagnosed between
August 1987 and June 1988 and 432 healthy women. They ranged in age
from 25 to 83.
   Breast cancer patients had significantly greater deposits of
upper body fat in several key body sites, plus greater waist-to-hip
and abdomen-to-thigh comparison ratios, researchers found.
   The Moffitt team thinks upper body fat leads to breast cancer
because it disturbs the hormonal system. Breast cancer has been
linked to obesity in previous studies, cancer experts said, but
this study also looked at normal-weight woman with breast cancer.
   The second study, published in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine, said the presence of an enzyme called cathepsin D could
help doctors determine which women should receive chemotherapy or
radiation treatment after breast cancer surgery.
   The enzyme appears to play a part in the rapid production of
cancer cells, according to the study.
   Doctors at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San
Antonio found that breast cancer patients with higher levels of the
enzyme had 2.6 times the chance of a relapse and 3.9 times the
possibility of dying in five years compared with those who had low
levels of the enzyme.
   The detection of the enzyme may help doctors shape treatment for
breast cancer victims who don't show signs of the disease having
spread _ a condition called node-negative disease.
   Only about 30 percent of node-negative patients experience a
recurrence. but until now doctors have been unable to figure out
which patients were likely to be among those stricken a second time.
   By measuring levels of the enzyme, doctors may be able to target
therapy to women who could benefit the most. The National Cancer
Institute now recommends that all node-negative women receive
chemotherapy, which is both costly and painful.
   The apple vs. pear health disparity was in the news in another
context last week, when researchers in St. Louis reported a link
between cholesterol levels and the distribution of body fat.
   The study reported in last week's New England Journal of
Medicine showed people with fat waists have lower levels of HDL
cholesterol, the ``good cholesterol,'' believed to protect against
heart disease.
   That study could help explain why women have lower rates of
heart disease than men, researchers said.

   Police raided slums around Santiago on
Thursday and detained more than 100 suspects for questioning, but
caught none of the 43 leftist guerrillas who escaped from a prison
in the capital two days earlier.
   The escapees, many of them involved in a 1986 attempt to kill
military President Augusto Pinochet, contacted local reporters to
give details on their escape through a 300-foot-long tunnel that
took more than a year to dig.
   They said the escapees succeeded in spreading throughout this
city of 4.5 million people early Tuesday and hiding ``out of reach
of security agents.''
   The lame-duck military regime appointed an army general, Joaquin
Valenzuela, to head Chile's prisons system. He replaces Horacio
Ojeda, who resigned Wednesday following the mass escape.
   Most of the jailbreakers belonged to the Manuel Rodriguez
Patriotic Front, a pro-Communist urban guerrilla gang that claimed
responsibility for the Sept. 7, 1986, attempt to kill Pinochet.
Pinochet, president and army commander, escaped unharmed, but six
of his bodyguards were killed.
   The elected government of Patricio Aylwin takes over next month.

<HEAD>Staffer Blasts Ombudsman's Recommendation for U.S. Military Paper</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY THORSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A civilian editor at the Pacific Stars and Stripes
says a recommendation to name a civilian as chief editor and make
it easier to hire and fire would not end problems at the U.S.
military paper.
   Dewey Brackett, who in congressional testimony has criticized
conditions at the government-run paper, said proposals by ombudsman
Philip M. Foisie could even ``weaken the newspaper's integrity and
its independence.''
   Foisie, a former foreign editor at the Washington Post and
executive editor of the International Herald Tribune, was named
ombudsman for the two Stars and Stripes newspapers last June,
raising hopes of civilian staffers like Brackett who complain of
censorship and other problems.
   The European Stars and Stripes, published in West Germany, is
edited separately from the Tokyo-based Pacific paper.
   Last weekend, the Stars and Stripes published a report on
Foisie's interim recommendations on the editorship of the papers.
The ombudsman said he was issuing the proposals before his overall
report on the Pacific paper because the Pentagon had announced that
a U.S. Marine colonel would succeed the U.S. Air Force colonel now
carrying the title editor in chief of the paper.
   Foisie recommends that a military officer continue to command
the paper's mix of military and civilian staff members, but with
the title of publisher.
   He said a civilian ``who has devoted his career to quality daily
print journalism'' should be in charge of what appears in the
newspaper.
   He also recommends new personnel policies, including ``the
ability to dismiss editorial personnel expeditiously for what (the
publisher and editor) regard as valid professional cause and to
hire the best available journalists.''
   Brackett said that would give less protection than civilian
journalists have now.
   Col. Edwin J. Montgomery, who retires this spring after four
years as editor in chief, said Thursday the ombudsman's proposal
``looks workable to me. I think it's important to get the right
person in the job'' of editor.
   The Pentagon is expected to consider the ombudsman's
recommendations as well as congressional views.
   Meanwhile, Brackett and the paper's Okinawa bureau chief, Kate
Pound, said a new directive from U.S. Pacific military headquarters
in Hawaii could restrict reporters' freedom. The directive makes
Stars and Stripes reporters subject to decisions by base commanders
to restrict off-base travel by U.S. government employees.
   Ms. Pound said in a telephone interview that the rule could
block Stars and Stripes reporters from reporting on anti-base
demonstrations or attacks on U.S. troops in the Philippines, Japan,
South Korea or Micronesia.
   The paper's reporters have no special access on military bases,
she said, ``and now they're saying that since we are government
employees, they can limit us off-base, too.''
   ``If they get tough, all we're going to be able to cover is the
opening of the officers' wives club gift shop.''
   Montgomery said U.S. commanders are responsible for the safety
of U.S. government personnel. But, he added, ``If we need to have
those policies relaxed for the purposes of gathering news, then we
can request they be relaxed.''

   An unspecified number of local longshore
officials are to plead guilty in federal court as early as Friday
as part of an investigation into mob influence in the union, a
source said Thursday.
   A highly placed member of the union who spoke only on condition
of anonymity said that a number of officials from local unions of
the International Longshoremen's Association were to plead guilty
in a U.S. District Court Friday.
   Ann Driscoll, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney in Brooklyn,
confirmed that some union officials from the ILA were to plead in
U.S. District Court Friday. She said she did not immediately have
information about who they are or what the charges were.
   The ILA is the target of several investigations in the New York
area.
   On Wednesday, a U.S. Justice Department source said that federal
prosecutors were poised to file a lawsuit next week seeking to
place several ILA locals under court trusteeship. The department
was to allege that the locals had been under the influence of
organized crime.
   The New York and Newark, N.J., locals of the ILA are considered
among the most influenced by organized crime, said one government
labor racketeering investigator.
   The lawsuit would be similar to the action settled last year
against the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, in which the
government sought to control the Teamsters union by placing it in
trusteeship.

   A man who was paroled after setting his son
on fire seven years ago said through a spokesman Thursday he will
honor the boy's wishes that he stay away.
   Charles Rothenberg was paroled from a 13-year prison sentence in
California on Jan. 24. After his release, he said he wanted to be
reunited with his son, David, who was six at the time his father
set fire to his bed.
   However, the badly disfigured boy, now 13, said at a news
conference last week he wished his father could be jailed for life,
and would never forgive him.
   Rothenberg said he saw his son on television and plans to
``respect David's wishes,'' said Harry J. Gaynor, president of the
National Burn Victim Foundation, a burn victims' advocacy group in
Orange.
   Two days after Rothenberg's release from prison, Gaynor
announced plans to publish Rothenberg's autobiography and letters.
He said the writings could provide insight into the mind of abusive
parents.

   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh wants an
independent counsel to determine if former Housing Secretary Samuel
R. Pierce Jr. and his aides broke the law by steering federal rent
subsidies to politically connected developers.
   Thornburgh, stressing that the special prosecutor law left him
no other choice, said an independent counsel is needed to determine
if Pierce and other former housing officials ``may have violated
federal criminal law'' in the way they chose developers to
participate in the moderate rehabilitation program between 1984 and
1988.
   The Department of Housing and Urban Development program provides
rent subsidies and lucrative tax to developers who perform a
moderate amount of rehabilitation on low-income housing units.
   Thornburgh's formal application to a special court cited reports
of a ``widespread perception among developers'' and local officials
that ``funds were being disbursed in disproportionate amounts to
projects backed by prominent Republicans acting as consultants or
by former HUD officials.''

   A man with severe Parkinson's disease showed
marked improvement after receiving a transplant of brain tissue
from an aborted fetus into his own brain, European researchers
report.
   The transplanted fetal brain tissue apparently thrived and is
producing dopamine, a brain chemical that is essential for normal
controlled muscle movements, the researchers reported in a study
published in Science magazine today.
   Olle Lindvall of the University Hospital in Lund, Sweden, chief
author of the report, told The Washington Post that the study,
involving a single patient, ``is very exciting and promising
news.'' But he cautioned that the study ``does not prove that we
can get this effect in other patients or sustain it in this one.''
   Parkinson's disease occurs when areas of the brain degenerate
and stop producing dopamine, a neurotransmitter essential for
carrying signals from one part of the brain to another. By
transplanting fetal brain tissue into the affected area,
researchers hope to restore the production of dopamine.

   A new report says the number of Americans
becoming infected annually with the virus that causes AIDS is
declining, although the number of new AIDS cases will continue
rising until 1995.
   The report's author, Peter Plumley, a consulting actuary in
Chicago, also says the chances that a heterosexual not using drugs
intravenously will become infected are remote and that AIDS
prevention efforts focus too much on this group.
   Plumley writes in the January-February issue of Contingencies
magazine that the number of new annual infections with the human
immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, peaked in 1986 and is going down.
   However, he says the total number of HIV-infected Americans will
continue to rise until 1991, when 1.4 million will be infected.

<HEAD>A British Perspective on Hollywood Redbaiting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For all its tragic drama and cruel farce,
Hollywood's anti-communist blacklisting has rarely been transformed
into moneymaking cinema, and that makes ``Fellow Traveller'' the
surprise of the British movie season.
   This low-budget movie about American victims of American
redbaiting is British-made and set largely in Britain.
   ``The American film industry has always been a world film
industry. American culture is my culture as well,'' explains
Michael Eaton, the English screenwriter.
   ``Fellow Traveller,'' he says, ``organically involves both our
countries.''
   The film's budget of under $3 million was shared by Home Box
Office and the British Broadcasting Corporation, with some
assistance from the British Film Institute. It opened Jan. 5 at
London's tiny Metro Cinema, where it broke the house record with an
opening week gross of $20,000. It will be seen in the United States
March 3 on the HBO cable channel.
   ``Fellow Traveller'' exemplifies the trend toward Anglo-American
cross-fertilization in the movie and television industries, and
``for once the balance of forces works perfectly,'' wrote critic
Adam Mars-Jones in The Independent.
   Mars-Jones praised ``a screenplay full of sharpness and
unpredictability,'' while The Observer's Philip French called it
``one of the most politically sophisticated, visually imaginative
British pictures of the past decade.''
   The Hollywood blacklists resulted from the investigations of the
House Committee on Un-American Activities into alleged communist
infiltration of Hollywood in the years after World War II.
   Hollywood people blacklisted as communists or ``fellow
travellers'' _ sympathizers _ were forced out of the movie
business, or given no alternative but to name others with communist
leanings. Many careers in acting, screenwriting and directing were
destroyed. A few victims committed suicide, others worked under
pseudonyms or fled to Britain.
   The legacy of those times still haunts the industry. In
December, the Lorimar Studios changed the name of its Robert Taylor
Building after tenants complained in a petition that the late actor
testified before Congress against the so-called Hollywood 10,
writers alleged to have associated with communist organizations
during the 1930s, '40s or '50s. Taylor also was considered a
supporter of the blacklist that kept those writers from working
under their own names.
   In ``Fellow Traveller,'' Asa Kaufman, an American screenwriter,
moves to London to escape the witch hunt and earns a living writing
screenplays for a Robin Hood TV series.
   Meanwhile, back in Hollywood, redbaiting has driven actor
Clifford Byrne, Kaufman's best friend, to suicide. Woven into the
story is the role of Dr. Leavy, a Hollywood psychotherapist and
communist sympathizer whose motivation is critical to the film's
denouement.
   Kaufman is played by Ron Silver, Byrne by Hart Bochner and Leavy
by Daniel J. Travanti.
   Kaufman's Robin Hood screenplays become the ironic counterpoint
to his predicament, while flashbacks cleverly juxtapose the glamour
and sunshine of Hollywood with rainy Britain, its postwar austerity
and the early days of its commercial television.
   The film is loosely based on true incidents. Eaton used Victor
A. Navasky's book, ``Naming Names,'' for background. Kaufman's
story somewhat parallels that of Ring Lardner Jr., who wrote over
40 episodes of ``Robin Hood'' for Britain's Independent Television
network between 1954 and 1960. The Byrne character is reminiscent
of John Garfield, who died at 39 of a heart attack some thought may
have been brought on by pressure from the blacklisters.
   The Hollywood witch hunts are an episode rarely tackled head-on
by American moviemakers. Only in 1976 did a major movie on the
subject emerge _ Martin Ritt's ``The Front,'' starring Zero Mostel
and Woody Allen. In 1986 came Peter Yates's ``The House on Carroll
Street,'' with Kelly McGillis. Both films were written by blacklist
victim Walter Bernstein.
   ``Most of what you find tend to be allegories of giant ants
invading Los Angeles,'' said Eaton, pulpy science fiction movies
which only in retrospect came to be seen as veiled treatments of
anti-communist hysteria.
   ``Other films dealt with the situation and problem in America
from an American point of view,'' said the movie's British
director, Philip Saville.
   ``Fellow Traveller'' is about a man who runs away from his
country rather than face his predicament and drop his friends, said
Saville, who studied at Columbia University in New York in 1955-56.
   Saville and Eaton are teaming up for a second film, set against
the background of contemporary Hollywood moviemaking.

<HEAD>In Touristy East Berlin, Karl Marx Gets His Beard Pulled</HEAD>

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On East Berlin's austere Marx-Engels-Forum,
tourists climbed the bronze statue of the founders of communism one
recent weekend and snapped funky pictures for showing back home.
   As the camera clicked, they pulled at Karl Marx's beard, kissed
his cheek, sat on his shoulder and draped themselves over his knees.
   Not long ago they could have landed in jail for that. But
tourists have been pouring into East Berlin since the wall came
tumbling down and decorum isn't being forced upon them.
   At the Brandenburg Gate, excited Japanese tourists hoisted one
another onto the Berlin Wall, while one of their number recorded it
on video tape.
   East Berlin has tapped a new treasure trove in tourism, courtesy
of geopolitics.
   ``We are here to look around and to be part of history,'' said
Peter Bailey of Marlow, England, as he was moved through customs at
East Berlin's Friedrichstrasse train station.
   ``After we saw what happened on television, we decided to come
and see for ourselves.''
   In Western Europe, travel industry officials say, bookings for
Bulgaria, Romania and Czechoslovakia have more than doubled in some
cases since the revolutions there. But Berlin _ East and West _ is
special.
   Here, Western luxury and Eastern communism are within walking
distance of each other.
   West Berlin benefits as well.
   ``It is a unique situation in the world,'' said West Berlin's
tourism spokesman, Michael Brodersen, and because of it, West
Berlin's tourism industry is thriving.
   Nothing is laid-back nowadays at the Hotel California on West
Berlin's fancy Kurfuerstendamm. Now travelers must book three weeks
in advance to get a room when in the past at this time of year the
hotel was usually more than half empty.
   ``For the first time, Christmas and New Year were fully booked
and we have a lot more bookings until the summer than other
years,'' Brodersen said of hotels in West Berlin, which had 2.1
million visitors last year.
   The biggest increase came from American tourists, Brodersen
said, most of whom flock to the crumbling Berlin Wall.
   ``I just came over to get a little chunk of wall,'' said Francis
Scott, a retired engineer from Orlando, Fla., who first came here
with the 82nd Airborne Division in 1945 as part of the American
occupation force. He was with the 24th Infantry Division in Munich
when the Berlin Wall went up Aug. 13, 1961.
   Was chiseling away at the stubborn concrete special to Scott?
   ``Emotional? Absolutely! It is emotional for the whole damn
world,'' he said.
   Tom Erlbeck of Omaha, Neb., hurt his hands getting a piece of
the wall.
   ``All my relatives are from Germany, so it means a bit more to
me,'' said the third generation American. ``I'm getting a piece of
history for family and friends.''
   Nearby, local people were selling pieces of the wall.
   ``Americans come with big bags and take what they can get,''
said one seller, identifying himself only as Carl. His pieces sell
for up to $17.60 each.
   But for some paying for a piece of the wall is not the real
thing.
   ``Buy? Never! It's like prostitution,'' Scott, the former GI
said. ``It has no significance whatsoever.''
   Other tourists in the area didn't think having a piece of
concrete bore any special no significance.
   ``It is an absolute absurdity to chop away at a wall,'' said
Anton Van Nieuwpoort, a Dutch tourist.
   ``I came to see and experience a society which developed
differently than ours.''
   At the Hotel California, an employe also took a dim view of the
wall chiselers.
   ``They should have done that 10 years ago when it would have
meant something,'' he said. ``Now, they just want to have fun.''
   In East Berlin, history can get more palpable than the wall
itself.
   Tou rists had a front-row seat at one recent pro-democracy
protest near the Alexanderplatz.
   And, on the square itself, some got swept up in a tide of East
Berliners rushing toward a stand selling bananas. Bananas are still
a rarity in East Germany.
   That picture of East Berlin contrasts sharply with Unter den
Linden, the city's fancy main thoroughfare and key tourist
attraction with its bevy of 18th-and 19th-century wedding cake
buildings.
   But tourist Eric Demuynck from Belgium found a different, more
predictable East Berlin just blocks away.
   Walking through depressing neighborhoods still scarred by
shrapnel from World War II, he said, ``This is what I expected to
find.''

<TEXT>
   It's the 12th winter of civil war for
the rugged people of Afghanistan, but in the snow and mud of this
capital new hopes bud that spring will bring peace.
   Sounds of the bitter struggle between government forces and
Moslem guerrillas still rattle Kabul. But for the first winter in a
decade, Soviet troops aren't pulling the triggers and more and
cheaper food is in the larder.
   ``Now it is just brother against brother. There is less fighting
now,'' said Ahmad Amir Shah as he jerked his yellow Moskvich taxi
to avoid a shower of gray slush from an oncoming army truck.
   However, the guerrillas' rockets still slam into the city daily,
spreading panic in the mud-brick warrens that house most of Kabul's
2 million people.
   The U.S.-backed guerrillas known as the mujahedeen (holy
warriors) are just beyond the jagged mountains ringing the city.
   Government soldiers, some of them too young to shave, respond
with artillery fire. Late at night, Scud missiles launched from
secret government bases north and south of the city roar like
freight trains through the darkness, hurtling east toward the main
battlefronts near the border with Pakistan.
   But in Kabul's teeming markets a bounty of food _ unlike last
winter's scarce rations _ hints at better times.
   Turbaned men wrapped to their noses in thick brown shawls barter
with vendors in the muddy Shor Bazaar along the Kabul River.
   The vendors' carts are heaped with apples, oranges,
pomegranates, nuts and crispy slabs of unleavened ``naan'' bread.
Chickens squawk in wicker baskets, and great hunks of beef and
mutton hang in the open air. There are even pastries and sugar
candy.
   A naan the size of a dinner plate costs 8 cents, down from 10
cents a year ago when many bakeries shut down for lack of flour,
now available at $2 a 15-pound sack.
   A pound of mutton is about a fourth lower than a year ago at 52
to 70 cents, depending on the cut.
   This year's availability and prices mean that bread and meat,
the staples of the Afghan diet, are within reach of more people in
Afghanistan, where the average family's annual income is about $350.
   In the money changers' bazaar, the local currency, the afghani,
is strengthening against the dollar. It took 525 afghanis to buy a
dollar on Jan. 1 and by the end of the month it took just 500.
   ``Business is getting slightly better, but in the future, who
knows? It depends on politics and the war,'' said Raja Kumar, one
of the many ethnic Indian money dealers in the bazaar.
   Afghan government officials claim better planning, a crackdown
on hoarding and the government's success in defending major cities
are the main reasons for the improved supply situation.
   ``There were some mistakes by the government last winter of not
reserving enough food,'' government spokesman Naquib Sameer said.
``Now the people are sure the government is doing the best for
them.''
   But this success story rests largely on two external factors:
   _The Soviet Union, although it ended direct combat involvement
last February after nine years, still conducts a massive airlift of
weapons and food to the government, weather and mujahedeen rockets
permitting.
   _Mujahedeen leaders in neighboring Pakistan, where the most
powerful guerrilla groups are based, say they've instructed their
fighters to concentrate on military targets and stop attacking food
convoys.
   The Kabul government also received help from the weather. The
1988-89 winter was the city's worst in memory, when heavy snows
closed the airport and the Salang highway leading north to the
Soviet Union. This year the first snow didn't arrive in Kabul until
Jan. 17.
   The mujahedeen, who want to topple President Najib and install
an Islamic government, continue to attack the capital and other
cities with weapons supplied by the United States, Saudi Arabia and
other Moslem countries. But they acknowledge that the level of
fighting has declined since last year's humiliating failure to
capture Jalalabad, barely 37 miles from Pakistan.
   The mujahedeen had predicted they would take Kabul within weeks
or months after the Soviet withdrawal _ an optimistic view also
adopted by the U.S. government.
   But the guerrillas, instead of uniting under a joint command,
fell victim to internal rivalries that periodically burst into open
fighting. Some small guerrilla bands cut separate deals with
Najib's government and gave up the fight.
   The mujahedeen's top leaders insist they'll never negotiate with
Najib and his People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan, which
seized power by a military coup in 1978.
   ``Nobody can win this war,'' said Ahmad, the taxi driver. ``But
now maybe the government and the mujahedeen learn this.''

<TEXT>
   Gasoline lines have vanished across
Poland, not because gas is plentiful but because few can afford to
fill the tank anymore _ or to even take the car out of the garage.
   Polish drivers are being forced off the roads not only by the
doubling of gasoline prices but also by steep increases in car
registration fees, highway taxes and insurance premiums.
   All are part of the dramatic steps put into effect Jan. 1 as the
new non-communist government tries to create a free-market system
from Poland's beleagured economy.
   In the southeastern city of Lublin, drivers have turned in the
license plates for 13 percent of the registered cars, according to
a recent report on the television news.
   The state-owned fuel monopoly says sales of gasoline dropped
more than 20 percent during the first 20 days of 1990, compared
with 1989.
   Taxi drivers sit in parked cabs, unable to find passengers
willing to pay the 100-times-the-meter rate to cover the gas
prices. An estimated 60 percent of state-run enterprises aren't
using their fuel quotas because they can't pay the cost.
   Warsaw's streets are noticeably less congested, and gasoline
trucks have been seen cruising the capital looking for service
stations in need of a refill.
   But Poles are finding little pleasure in being able to drive in
and fill up without waiting hours in line.
   ``It was not good and it is not good,'' said a doctor about to
buy a tankful at a central Warsaw gas station.
   ``There is a saying: `What do you prefer, to freeze to death
outside your flat due to the low temperature or inside due to
faulty heating? Both situations are wrong,'' she said with a sigh.
   Gasoline now costs the zloty equivalent of 96 cents a gallon, up
from about 50 cents before Jan. 1.
   That is cheap by West European standards, but it is expensive
for Poles who, on the average, earn 560,000 zlotys, about $60, a
month.
   In addition, a car owner now must pay 440,000 zlotys a year for
insurance and 49,500 for highway taxes and registration.
   The higher gas prices are part of the government's effort to
stop paying producers huge subsidies to keep consumer prices
artificially low.
   That system left the economy with a staggering budget deficit,
unbridled inflation and little motivation for efficiency.
   Although drivers are disgruntled, the reduced demand also may
allow Poland to cut its costly fuel imports.
   Gasoline supplies have long been a barometer of the Polish
economic crisis, with filling the tank a major project that
dominated drivers' schedules and itineries.
   Car owners suffered through years of rationing, and even after
the coupon system ended Jan. 1, 1989, supplies were frequently as
short as the tempers on lines.
   No more.
   ``Never have filling stations been as uncrowded,'' said the
weekly Polityka. ``Warsaw has become a truly Western capital by
this standard: you drive up and there is a smiling attendant
waiting to fill your car.''
   At one Warsaw gas station, where it was not unusual to see a
hundred drivers waiting at dawn, the manager said the eight cars at
the pumps at midday constituted a rush.
   He said a tanker truck's gas delivery that he was able to sell
in 10 hours now lasts two or three days.
   Attentants says customers drive in for as little as two liters,
a bit more than a half-gallon.
   The notion of competing for customers is new in Poland, and the
gas station manager, clearly not ready to give away mugs or road
maps, rejected the idea of offering small extra services, such as
cleaning the windshield.

   Elvis Presley, 42, is still dead. But try to
tell that to fans of the man who sang arias with such lyrics as
``You ain't nothin' but a hound dog.'' They'll just boo you and
maybe whomp you upside the head.
   They have a very big treat coming up this week: ABC's ``Elvis,''
a half-hour series about the early, scuffling part of his career.
The show is premiering Tuesday, then starts its regular run Sunday.
   Created by Rick Husky, and filmed in Memphis, Tenn., this Elvis
is played by Michael St. Gerard. He vaguely resembles Presley.
Alas, he just doesn't seem as accomplished an actor.
   But Elvis fans will be hard pressed to find fault with the
series, which has three executive producers _ one of them the
King's ex-wife, Priscilla _ and warns all that it is a
``dramatization'' of events in Presley's life.
   The show's tone is highly reverential, much in the manner of a
documentary about Abraham Lincoln or Gandhi. Those expecting good
ol' boy humor are advised to rent a great Burt Reynolds flick,
``W.W. and the Dixie Dancekings.''
   Although slow and dull, ``Elvis'' is rife with indications that
the polite, sometimes sullen-looking young man in the sideburns is
destined for greatness and might even become a major cultural force
in America.
   You can tell. In one nightclub scene, for example, he sings
``Money Honey'' and sets everyone to dancing. In Sunday's show, a
disc jockey plays Elvis' first record, causing much of Memphis to
come down with happy feet.
   The premiere opens with bluesy harmonica music heard as a car
rolls past a Mississippi cotton field. This is because it's against
the law in TV to show a car rolling past a Mississippi cotton field
without bluesy harmonica music.
   The car contains one sheriff and Elvis' father, Vernon (Billy
Green Bush, who does a fine, low-key job despite a bad script). It
is gently establshed that Presley is seeing his wife and young son
before being taken to prison.
   It's not clear why he's going to jail. But he tells Elvis, who
is 3 years old here, that he's the man of the house now and to take
care of his mother. The lad seems to understand.
   Later scenes, with Vernon now out of prison but suffering back
problems that force him to quit work, include Elvis' historic visit
to Sun Records in Memphis to record a song for his mother's
birthday.
   It will be old news to Elvis fans that the company's owner, Sam
Phillips (Jordan Williams), is mighty impressed with Presley's
voice. No matter that here he tells the kid: ``You got a raw sound,
Elvis. Real raw.''
   Maybe so, but there's nothing even mildly raw in this show. The
only dramatic tension consists of Elvis' desire to do other than
work at a wire warehouse and his father's concern that Elvis keep
that job, however grungy and low-paying.
   ``We all get chances, Elvis,'' he says. ``Some of them we just
can't take. Life's that way. ... Sometimes it don't give you a
choice.''
   Ah, but TV does. And unless you want to see Elvis Presley
canonized for the next eight weeks _ longer if ABC renews the show
_ it'd be wise to pass on this series, find a good book to curl up
with and start curling.

<HEAD>If You're Going To Chase Interest Rates, Chase Them Downhill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the 1970s, a decade of inflation, people
chased prices, hoping to makes purchases before sales tags could be
marked even higher.
   By compressing the demand for goods, by moving up future
purchases into the present, however, such buyers did their bit to
push prices even higher. To some small degree, they helped fulfill
their fearful prophecy.
   As the 1990s begin, another chase might be developing, this one
involving home mortgage rates. Those rates had been falling. Now
they are rising, just as would-be homeowners prepare for the spring
buying season.
   During the past three or four months, real estate agents in many
parts of the country have observed that potential buyers were
delaying purchases, hoping to find lower mortgage rates.
   Now that rates are rising, some of these buyers might feel
compelled to act quickly to avoid even higher rates. Combined with
the historical spring upturn in housing demand, this could create
stiffer borrowing terms.
   So far, there is little evidence that the scenario is happening,
but some housing people and mortgage lenders are suggesting the
possibility.
   So, some reminders for those who might become involved:
   1. The recent upward movement of home mortgage rates has indeed
been sharp. HSH Associates, which tracks rates nationally, says the
average of fixed-rate loans recently was 10.12 percent, up
one-quarter of a percent in two weeks.
   Moreover, news has developed recently to douse hopes of any
cuts. Perhaps most significant was the the statement by Alan
Greenspan, Federal Reserve board chairman, that he foresees slow
expansion rather than recession.
   2. There is very little evidence, however, that recent increases
are part of a long-term trend. Many bankers and financial analysts
still believe that rates will resume falling this year, especially
as the economy weakens.
   3. Still, few people can forget the devastation wrought by those
15 percent-plus prime rates in the 1970s. They fear that such a
situation could develop again, putting them out of the housing
market for years.
   The climate of the 1990s, however, is much different from those
days.
   In the 1970s and early 1980s there were fundamental fears that
the economy had gone crazy. Prices soared, and so did debt. Some
small businesses actually paid 25 percent to borrow money in 1981;
still, some were turned away.
   Viewing that scene and the trend, lenders feared that the future
could only be worse. The rate, the cost to Uncle Sam, on 30-year
government bonds hit double-digit levels _ 13.6 per cent in 1981 _
for the first time in memory.
   But, rates began backing down again in 1985. Near the end of
last year that same 30-year bond was under 8 percent, indicating a
return of confidence in the future. That same observation applies
also to lenders on 30-year mortgages.
   The recent rise, which brought the 30-year bond above 8.5
percent, is only a few weeks old, and cannot be used to suggest a
sustained loss of faith in the future. If it persists, yes, but it
could come back down suddenly too.
   It adds up to this advice for those who intend someday to buy a
home:
   Don't be panicked into believing that interest rates only go up.
They come down too, sometimes when least expected. In the 1970s,
some alleged authorities said we would never again see single-digit
mortgage rates. We have.
   The lesson is this: Reconsider before chasing prices or interest
rates higher, because there may be little to be gained. It might be
smarter to sit back and relax, and let prices and rates come to you.

   Lights, camera, hype.
   It's time for the obligatory opening night press conference, and
the room is jammed with journalists and others lucky enough to get
in for a glimpse of the show's stars.
   But wait. This isn't the movies. This is the theater, and
serious theater at that.
   The show is ``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,'' Tennessee Williams'
Pulitzer Prize-winning drama. The ticket is movie star Kathleen
Turner, making her debut as Williams' sultry Maggie, a role
originated by Barbara Bel Geddes on stage and later by Elizabeth
Taylor on screen.
   The hype is inevitable, the producers say.
   ``She really spells glamour,'' explained Fran Weissler, who is
producing the Broadway-bound play with her husband, Barry Weissler.
``She's a real movie star, and that excites people.''
   The excitement is such that 52 reporters and photographers
descended on Pittsburgh's Benedum Center for the Jan. 23 press
conference, some from out of state.
   The tall, blond actress, whose film credits include ``Body
Heat,'' ``Romancing the Stone,'' ``Prizzi's Honor,'' ``The
Accidental Tourist'' and ``The War of the Roses,'' seized center
stage as soon as she sat down next to co-stars Charles Durning,
Daniel Hugh Kelly and Polly Holliday.
   She was in perpetual motion, flinging her hair over her
shoulders, lounging back in her chair and leaning toward Durning
and Kelly, losing her shoes under the table, taking her wire-rimmed
glasses off and on.
   Most of the questions were for Turner, who said she always had
longed for the part. When the questions weren't, she would
interrupt her co-stars during their responses and chat with the
actors beside her while one of the others spoke.
   Turner was visibly pleased when a reporter asked if she agrees
with the public's assessment of her as a fantasy figure.
   ``I'm a fantasy figure? Ahhh,'' she said, breathing heavily and
twisting seductively in her chair. ``Do you agree with that Mr.
Durning? Let someone else answer that.
   ``Nah, come on, it's acting, guys. It really truly really is.
It's fun to be able to play these women with all this wonderful
power and allure, and intelligence, I'd like to add. But it's
acting. It's just fun. I'm really not like that at home.''
   What is she like at home?
   ``None of your business,'' she replied. ``That's private.''
   As soon as the news conference ended, many in the crowd surged
forward for autographs. The actress obliged for a few moments then
was whisked away for rehearsal. No private interviews, no
pestering, please.
   Welcome to Broadway, way off-Broadway, Hollywood-style.
   ``It's tough. The more advance you have, the luckier you are as
a producer,'' Fran Weissler said.
   A big name star usually facilitates financing a play, which can
run into several million dollars, said Harvey Sabinson, executive
director of the League of American Theaters and Producers.
   ``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof'' is due to open at Broadway's Eugene
O'Neill Theater on March 21 after runs in Wilmington, Del.,
Pittsburgh, Boston and Philadelphia. Turner is committed to the
show until mid-July.
   The Weisslers said the actress was their No. 1 choice because _
and only because _ she's perfect for the part.
   ``I would say that show could run as long as she's committed,''
Sabinson said. ``There were two reasons for hiring Kathleen Turner.
One, she's a fine actress, and two, she's a big name, too.''
   Turner is by no means the first major motion picture star to
play the Great White Way.
   ``(Katharine) Hepburn worked both sides. Jack Lemmon has been on
Broadway. Lots of Hollywood stars have since the breakdown of the
studio system years ago where actors weren't tied up for life to a
studio,'' Sabinson said.
   ``Most of your big stars started on Broadway: Spencer Tracy,
Clark Gable. They all started on Broadway. They like to work before
live audiences.''
   That's one reason why Turner is back on stage. The 35-year-old
actress had a tiny role in one of the replacement casts for the
long-running Broadway production of ``Gemini'' in 1978.
   ``The immediate response one garners on stage, the communal
feeling as an audience comes together in this experience, is so
supportive. It's so exciting,'' Turner said. ``I really feel there
are moments when you start reading thoughts back and forth. It's
just wonderful.
   ``I don't prefer either (film or stage). I want both.''
   Even with the media's bright spotlight, big names on the marquee
don't necessarily assure a long run.
   Ticket sales for ``3 Penny Opera'' with rock star Sting as Mack
the Knife failed to meet expectations, for instance, and the show
closed Dec. 31 after two months on Broadway. Shakespeare's ``The
Merchant of Venice,'' starring Dustin Hoffman on the other hand, is
scheduled to close March 10 when the ensemble disbands, after a
virtually sold-out, three-month run.
   The best combination is a great star in a great production of a
good play.
   ``The play is always the thing,'' Sabinson said, ``just like
Shakespeare wrote.''

   Garage mechanics listen for pings. Piano
tuners are alert for plunks. Donald E. Marlowe's job is to wait for
the next POW! to shatter the silence of his laboratory.
   Marlowe is the government's chief condom tester, and the
explosions come from an ``air burst'' test he is perfecting to
measure sample condoms' resistance to pressure.
   Working in a low, nondescript building that the Food and Drug
Administration shares with a furniture store in this Washington
suburb, Marlowe demonstrates by slipping a latex condom onto a
machine equipped with gauges, dials and the squiggly needle of an
instrument that looks like a seismograph.
   Then he inflates the condom with air. It swells to the size of a
good-sized watermelon before it bursts. The instruments record that
it withstood 30 liters or about 7{ gallons of air and pressure of
three-tenths of a pound per square inch, well above the
government's exacting standard.
   ``Pretty tough,'' says Marlowe, a 49-year-old mechanical
engineer who runs the division of mechanics and material science
for the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health.
   In another room, Marlowe takes a circular section cut from the
middle of a condom, similar to a wide rubber band, and stretches it
on a machine to test its tensile strength _ how far it will stretch
before it snaps.
   Besides condoms, Marlowe's laboratory tests a wide variety of
medical devices such as cardiac pacemakers, artificial hearts and
valves, false eyes, syringes, pumps and bone, joint and ligament
implants.
   Nearly four dozen of these prosthetic body parts are attached to
``Yorick,'' the FDA's bionic skeleton, which greets visitors to the
laboratory where all the devices have been tested over the years.
   ``The FDA is responsible for the safety and effectiveness of
medical devices, and condoms are a medical device,'' Marlowe said.
   Marlowe is accustomed to the snickers and jokes he sometimes
hears about condoms. He chuckles indulgently about the time his
staff, in a playful holiday mood, inflated some condoms with helium
and tied them to the office Christmas tree. ``They looked great,''
he said.
   But Marlowe says that with widespread public concern over the
AIDS epidemic and former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop's highly
publicized campaign to promote safer sex, condoms are no laughing
matter.
   Since the early 1960s, FDA agents at a Winchester, Mass.,
laboratory north of Boston have been conducting random, unannounced
tests of sample condoms from domestic and foreign manufacturers for
possible water leakage.
   During the year ended in April 1988, the FDA tested 115,000
condoms for possible pinholes or tears in this way, resulting in
rejection of more than 30 million imported condoms as defective and
the recall of 3 million domestic condoms from store shelves.
   Marlowe said his laboratory's air burst and tensile strength
tests for condoms form the basis for an industrywide testing
standard that was first published in 1973 and was revised most
recently in November.
   That standard is recognized voluntarily by manufacturers, the
government and consumer interests, including the U.S. Agency for
International Development, which supplies condoms for Third World
population control projects. Compliance is determined during the
FDA's regular ``quality assurance'' inspections of manufacturers.
   ``Someone new coming into the lab gets over the bathroom humor
about condoms very quickly,'' Marlowe said. ``This is serious
business.''

<HEAD>U.S. Market's Latest Worry: Where the Japanese Put Their Money</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JULIA C. MARTINEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese-German relations, once a mighty
military threat vanquished by America nearly a half-century ago,
have come back to haunt the U.S. financial markets. This time the
weapon is plenty of money.
   Investors from Japan, the largest single source of foreign
capital to the United States, are shifting their sights to
attractive European markets, namely booming West Germany, which is
emerging as the most powerful economic force reshaping Eastern
Europe.
   The thought that the enormously wealthy Japanese may be hanging
back from U.S. investments dampened the stock market's mood this
past week and injected new anxiety into the market for Treasury
securities.
   An impending $30 billion Treasury auction this week could
provide a better clue about the extent to which Japanese investors
are willing to keep financing America's federal deficit, economists
say.
   Poor participation would suggest that interest rates must rise
to attract buyers. This would make bonds more competitive with
stocks and would raise borrowing costs of American corporations,
lowering their profits.
   For weeks Japanese investors have been lightening up on American
equities, partly to raise cash for margin calls on their own
heavily leveraged stocks at home, economists say. Japanese stocks
have been falling mainly in response to rising interest rates and
inflation pressures.
   More significantly, Japanese investors have discovered
potentially more lucrative markets in West Germany since the Berlin
Wall came tumbling down.
   ``The Japanese have taken money otherwise going to buy U.S.
stocks and bonds and are investing in West Germany,'' said
economist Mark Killion with DRI-McGraw-Hill Inc. in Lexington, Mass.
   West Germany is particularly attractive to Japanese investors
for two reasons: exchange rates _ the mark is stronger against both
the dollar and the yen; and political changes in Eastern Europe,
which are expected to enormously benefit the West German economy.
Both are pushing up West German interest rates.
   ``The highest rates of return available today are in Germany,''
said Marc M. Goloven, an international economist with Manufacturers
Hanover Trust Co.
   In the week ending Jan. 26, the long-term West German government
bond yielded 7.56 percent, Goloven said. The comparable Japanese
yield was 6.19 percent. Although the U.S. Treasury's long-term bond
was yielding 8.48 percent, the rising value of the mark still made
the West German bonds worth more.
   Higher West German rates stem partly from the influx of people
into West Germany from throughout Eastern Europe, which is putting
pressure on prices, particularly housing, and raising the inflation
rate. The West German central bank's answer to rising inflation is
to raise interest rates.
   In addition, unification of Western Europe markets under the
European Economic Community in 1992 has incited a rush of
investments by the Japanese, who fear that heightened trade
restrictions could keep them out.
   ``There's a lot of incentive for Japanese investors to get into
Europe now before the barriers come crashing down,'' Killion said.
``The feeling in Japan is that investors will have a much better
prospect for working successfully in European markets if they get
there before 1992 occurs.''
   Nonetheless, economists emphasize that Japanese investors, while
investing in Europe, are not abandoning U.S. markets.
   ``The question is not whether Japanese investors are going to
come to the United States, but at what price,'' said Lawrence A.
Veit, international economist with Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co.
   Veit says European markets are not large enough to absorb huge
amounts of Japanese money.
   ``So whereas the Japanese can send a lot of money in a short
time to Europe, it is not feasible to think that they will send a
lot of money over a long period of time,'' Veit said.
   Economists say there are still many reasons the Japanese will
come to U.S. markets, including political stability.
   ``We still attract significant amounts of Japanese investment
capital and will continue to do so whether in the form of direct
investment in such things as automobile assembly plants or
portfolio investments in stocks and bonds,'' Goloven said.

   Hattie Dudley has a list.
   It started taking shape Oct. 24, the day after Charles Stuart
unleashed the lie that his wife, Carol, was killed by a black man
outside a Mission Hill housing project. That was the day Hattie
Dudley saw a young Hispanic man on the street stopped, stripped and
searched by police looking for suspects in the death of the
30-year-old, and white, pregnant lawyer.
   She did not know who the young Hispanic man was, but the next
time she took names.
   Ms. Dudley, who raised her seven children in the Mission Hill
project she now runs, collected the names and stories of six young
people subjected to police searches in the hunt for a phantom
murderer. She and other residents say there were many more.
   ``They felt they were all accused murderers,'' she said of the
young men among the 3,000 mostly black and Hispanic residents of
the Mission Hill projects.
   Her list even includes a young woman detained in a police car
for 20 minutes until a female officer arrived to don rubber gloves
and inspect the woman's private parts, Ms. Dudley says. She doesn't
say the search was directly related to the Stuart case, but it
illustrates for her the liberties authorities took.
   Police do not discount such stories outright but say no one has
come forward to complain of police conduct in the Mission Hill
search.
   Martha Knight might have come forward. But her son cannot
identify those who searched him. He was standing at an intersection
with a girlfriend when police surrounded him on all sides. They
made him pull down his trousers and then his underwear and shined a
flashlight on his buttocks, she said. Then they let him go.
   ``It makes you angry,'' said Ms. Knight. ``It makes you feel
less than human. And who do you complain to?''
   Officers combed Mission Hill with the description of a black man
existing only in Stuart's imagination: 28 to 34 years old, about
5-foot-10, weighing 150 to 160 pounds, with a raspy voice, a short
Afro and splotchy facial hair.
   Police spokesman Jim Jordan said basic homicide investigation
procedures were followed in the search for suspects, and
authorities point to a long-standing policy of investigating
civilian charges of misconduct.
   But Ms. Knight and others say they don't know where to turn.
They are distrustful of the police to begin with, an apprehension
reinforced in recent months by a citywide drug crackdown _ before
the Stuart shootings _ in which suspected dealers were stopped and
searched on the streets.
   After Stuart himself was implicated in his wife's death and
jumped to his death from a bridge Jan. 4, the outrage burst forth
in angry, collective protests. Many leaders of the minority
community now faulted the police for their readiness to accept a
stereotypical suspect. Police countered that no one doubted Stuart
in the early weeks and that they would have been derelict not to
have based the search on his description.
   Police installed a 24-hour complaint hotline, and the state
attorney general is looking at both the stop-and-search tactic and
the manner in which individuals were questioned in the Stuart case.
   But Deputy Superintendent Arthur Morgan Jr., who heads the
police internal affairs office, said he still knows of no
unjustified searches.
   ``I need someone to come up and tell me they've been stopped
illegally and searched illegally and point out the policeman who
did it,'' Morgan said.
   Hattie Dudley is keeping her list to herself. She doesn't trust
government investigators, she said.
   ``All during the civil rights movement, there was the FBI and
the Justice Department investigators,'' she said, ``and all we got
from them was a dead leader _ Martin. Martin Luther King.''
   In the days after the Stuart shootings, many Mission Hill
residents were as eager as others throughout the city to see a
suspect caught.
   ``The man who did it should be taken out,'' Anthony Stanley, 23,
said two days after the incident. ``We got to get the death penalty
back. The guy was foul. He had no heart.''
   But then they watched day after day _ until several weeks later
when the investigation focused on a suspect in custody for another
crime _ as young men were stopped on the streets, told to lean
spread-eagled against police cars and searched.
   ``It was just crazy times, something you see in the movies,''
said Ms. Knight, a community organizer. ``Even though there were
more police, we didn't feel more protected. ...
   ``It makes you think that they can come in just because of where
we live. I'm sure they couldn't go to Beacon Hill or some other
middle-class neighborhood and do the same thing.''
   Hector Mercado said he was stopped and patted down three or four
times.
   ``It was like a war zone. A lot of cars, a lot of police going
inside of hallways, checking day and night,'' said Mercado, 19, who
is studying for his high school equivalency diploma. ``I feel badly
because they didn't have no right.''
   For one of the searches, Mercado was stopped on his way home
after escorting his wife, Madelyn, to her parents' apartment. He
was walking along the street minding his own business, he said,
when three officers ordered him to halt.
   ``One of them held his hand on his gun,'' Mercado recalled.
``They said, `Stop and get behind the car.'''
   One officer warned him: ``I don't want to see you around here.''
   Around where? Mercado now asks. Mission Hill is his home. It
might not be the best place in the world, but it is home.
   ``We were a people full of dignity. There was a real sense of
community and belonging and comfort,'' Ms. Dudley said. ``You know
when you're home, that relaxed feeling.''
   For now, she said, that's gone.

   New York Stock Exchange Chairman John J. Phelan
Jr. plans to retire at the end of the year, capping a tumultuous
tenure in which the nation's biggest securities market grew
explosively, suffered a devastating crash and struggled to recover.
   Phelan announced his departure at a news conference Thursday in
the NYSE's Wall Street headquarters after the close of the day's
trading.
   He said he had considered retirement for about a year, but had
not felt he could leave amid the continuing debate over market
volatility and the uncertainty raised by an Oct. 13 mini-crash.

   The U.S. economy fell sharply in January for the
ninth consecutive month and at the greatest rate of decline since
the last recession, the nation's purchasing managers said.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management said Thursday
its monthly index fell in January to 45.2 percent, down from 46.7
percent in December.
   A reading below 50 indicates that the U.S. manufacturing economy
is declining, while above 50 indicates expansion, the group said.
The index has been below 50 for the past nine months.

   Major U.S. retailers reported fair sales gains for January, a
transition month when stores clear out leftover holiday merchandise
to make room for fresh spring lines.
   Chains specializing in apparel reported the best growth Thursday
while several mass merchandisers, including the nation's largest
retailer, Sears, Roebuck and Co., tallied increases below the
industry average.
   Sales at stores open at least a year rose around 5 percent
industrywide from a year earlier, according to analysts' estimates.

   A bankruptcy judge refused to require two big

   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge J. Vincent Aug Jr. said Thursday that if
the financial condition of the Campeau Corp. retailers Federated
Department Stores and Allied Stores deteriorates, he would require
a one-month deposit.
   But he said the 596 utilities serving Federated and Allied

Year Seen</HEAD>

   Retailers could have a rough year if a loss of confidence in the
economy makes consumers more cautious about spending.
   ``It's going to be a tough, competitive year _ that's the bottom
line,'' predicted Monroe Greenstein, retail analyst at Bear Stearns
&amp; Co. Inc.
   Results reported Thursday by the nation's major general
merchandisers, department stores, discounters and specialty apparel
chains indicated the industry had satisfactory sales growth in
January.
   Sales at stores open at least a year rose around 5 percent from
a year earlier, according to analysts' estimates.
   Stores concentrating on apparel generally posted the highest
gains while several mass merchandisers, including the nation's
largest retailer, Sears, Roebuck and Co., tallied increases below
the industry average.
   January typically is slow in the retailing trade and the month
marks the end of the fiscal year for many merchants. Consumers
usually take a break from shopping after Christmas and some people
enter the new year with credit card debts that discourage them from
shopping for a while.
   Widespread price cutting and other promotions this past holiday
season _ particularly by debt-laden department stores desperate to
raise cash _ may have left buyers more bloated than usual.
   Jeffrey Edelman, of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said the
retailers with the leanest inventories due to good holiday business
generally had the smallest January sales growth. The stores that
were stuck with excess after Christmas and succeeded in pushing
merchandise out to make room for fresh spring lines reported higher
sales results.
   Edelman estimated that sales at general merchandise, apparel and
furniture retailers rose 5 percent in January from the prior year.
The change covered sales at stores open a year or longer, known as
same- or comparable-store sales. Analysts and store executives
consider same-store tallies the best indicator of a retailer's
health.
   Jeffrey Feiner, a Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. analyst, said recent
slippage in consumer confidence, reflecting uncertainty about
economic conditions and jittery financial markets, portends
possibly rougher times for retailers.
   ``Weakness in both the housing and financial markets makes the
outlook for consumer spending in retail stores ... likely to be
quite sluggish, at least over the near term,'' Feiner said.
   The Conference Board's monthly consumer confidence index
released Wednesday showed further erosion in January for the third
month in a row. The business research group said the index sank to
the lowest point since just after the October 1987 stock market
crash.
   Chicago-based Sears said overall sales rose 2.2 percent in the
four weeks ended Jan. 27 from a year earlier while sales at stores
open at least a year rose 3.3 percent.
   K mart, second in size to Sears and based in Troy, Mich.,
reported a 13.1 percent increase in total sales but, on a
same-store basis, sales were up 3.1 percent.
   No. 3-ranked Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the Bentonville, Ark.-based
discounter that has been outperforming its competitors, saw overall
sales surge 24 percent. Excluding newly opened stores, sales rose
10 percent.
   Among retailers concentrating on apparel, Dallas-based J.C.
Penney Co. Inc. said sales increased 8.5 percent. Same-store sales
rose 7.3 percent.
   The Limited Inc., the specialty apparel retailer based in
Columbus, Ohio, posted an 11 percent total sales increase while
sales grew 9 percent on a comparable-store basis.
   The Gap Inc., a clothing specialist headquartered in San
Francisco, said January sales soared 34 percent overall and 24
percent at stores open at least a year.
   Dayton Hudson Corp., the Minneapolis-based owner of department
stores and the large Target discount chain, said January sales rose
12.2 percent overall and same-store sales rose 5.2 percent.
   St. Louis-based May Department Stores Co. said its sales rose
5.2 percent, or 2.6 percent on a same-store basis.
   Woolworth Corp., the New York-based owner of F.W. Woolworth Co.
stores plus numerous specialty retailers including the Foot Locker
chain, said domestic January sales rose 8.5 percent. Domestic sales
rose 4.5 percent at stores open for a year or more.

   Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman
Richard C. Breeden wants to pack more punch when his agency goes
after financial fraud and securities law violators.
   Breeden told a Senate panel Thursday that policing Wall Street
would be easier if the SEC had access to grand jury testimony in
criminal probes and authority to fine securities law violators.
   Breeden also said he supported proposed legislation that would
disqualify major securities law violators from serving as officers
or directors of publicly held companies.
   But that authority should be in the hands of federal judges _
not the SEC _ he said.
   Breeden said the SEC should be able to tell repeat federal
securities offenders such as fugitive financier Robert Vesco:
``Your conduct is so severe that you're not going to get another
opportunity to do it again.''
   The SEC chief was the first witness at a hearing before the
Senate Banking Committee's securities subcommittee, which is
considering many of the reforms he proposed.
   The proposed Securities Law Enforcement Remedies Act was
introduced last year at the SEC's request by Sen. Christopher J.
Dodd, D-Conn., the subcommittee chairman, and Sen. John Heinz of
Pennsylvania, the ranking Republican.
   Other witnesses included two former heads of the SEC's key
Enforcement Division _ Gary G. Lynch and Stanley Sporkin _ and a
former SEC commissioner, Aulana L. Peters.
   Nearly all favored the proposed reforms.
   But the American Society of Corporate Secretaries, which
supports the bill's objectives, considers the language ``much too
broad,'' said Victor Futter, a board member for the nationwide
group of top executives.
   Futter told the panel that barring violators from holding
corporate office amounts to ``an economic death penalty'' and that
the fine provisions did not require proof of criminal conduct or
fraud.
   Sporkin, now a federal judge in Washington, also expressed doubt
about the proposal to bar violators from future corporate offices.
   ``Not everybody should be barred for life,'' he said. ``Even
Pete Rose has said he wants to come back'' to major league baseball.
   Lynch, who was enforcement director from 1985 to 1989, cautioned
that the ability to fine violators ``should only be exercised in
cases involving deliberate fraud or manipulation.''
   Breeden asked for the power to fine securities-law violators
either directly through SEC administrative proceedings or through
civil court actions.
   Currently the SEC can seek fines only in insider-trading cases,
unlike most federal financial regulators including the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, which oversees the futures industry,
and the Office of Thrift Supervision, the savings and loan watchdog.
   The SEC fines would range from a top maximum of $100,000 for an
individual to $500,000 for a company or other entity.
   Breeden also asked Congress to give the SEC access to grand jury
testimony in criminal securities investigations. He noted that SEC
lawyers often work side by side with the Justice Department in
criminal investigations such as the Ivan Boesky inside-trading case.
   But under current law, the SEC may not be given access to secret
grand jury testimony _ ``even when the information was developed by
our own personnel'' _ without a court ruling that it is necessary
for a judicial proceeding, Breeden said. He added that the SEC
can't get a look at criminal grand jury proceedings without such
court approval ``even after the criminal process is completed.''
   Breeden also requested ``cease and desist'' authority that would
allow the SEC to halt suspected illegal activities.
   Currently, the SEC must go to the overworked federal court
system and get a court order to halt alleged wrongdoings. That
could delay the agency from halting an alleged penny stock fraud if
it uncovers a boiler room operation with banks of fast-talking
sales people pressuring investors with get-rich-quick schemes, said
Breeden.
   Neither the cease and desist power nor the access to grand jury
testimony was included in the original bill introduced last year.

<HEAD>John Phelan To Retire as Head of New York Stock Exchange</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John J. Phelan Jr. has charted the New York
Stock Exchange through a period of explosive growth and
near-disaster, but he will leave the nation's largest trading forum
with critical issues unresolved.
   Phelan announced Thursday he would retire at the end of 1990 to
pursue a new but undetermined career, 42 years after he worked for
his father one summer as a ``runner'' on the stock exchange floor _
and hated it.
   Phelan's cool leadership helped the exchange recover from the
cataclysmic crash of Oct. 19, 1987, when the largest sell-off in
history wiped 508 points off the Dow Jones industrial average.
   He also championed new technology that enabled the market to
cope with record volume during the crash, implemented controversial
reforms designed to limit computerized trading and sought to assure
small investors they could get a fair shake in a market dominated
by professionals.
   At a news conference Thursday, Phelan said key issues such as
volatility in stock prices and the NYSE's relationship with the
nation's futures and options exchanges may have to be left to his
successsor.
   But Phelan said he felt he was stepping down at a time when the
exchange was healthy and he had sufficiently addressed the crash
and its aftermath.
   ``Markets and the exchange are the kinds of institutions where
you cannot press a button and resolve them overnight,'' he said.
``Because of the enormity of the constituent groups, the problems
are resolved over a period of time by constant dialogue and changes
and negotiation.''
   Phelan declined to specify what he might do next, though he said
he might seek to combine philanthropy, education and business. A
successor was expected to be named by the fall.
   Phelan quashed rumors he might replace Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady, who worked with him analyzing the crash. Phelan
said he had not been contacted about a government job and was not
considering one.
   Wall Street reacted with some surprise to Phelan's announcement
and praised his foresight in installing the technology that helped
the exchange survive the 1987 crash and a mini-crash last Oct. 13.
   ``It's been battered and bruised and yet it's stronger than
ever,'' said Securities Industry Association Chairman Robert N.
Downey, a partner at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. ``If (Phelan) hadn't been
out front pushing for the computerization, it never could have
handled the volume.''
   Under Phelan, the value of all stocks listed on the Big Board,
as the exchange is commonly known, has grown from $1.6 trillion to
more than $2.7 trillion, making it the world's second-largest
exchange behind Tokyo.
   Volume on the exchange has grown from 18.6 million shares a day
when Phelan became vice chairman in 1975 to about 170 million in
1989. More than 600 million shares changed hands on Black Monday in
1987.
   A onetime specialist managing trading activity on the floor,
Phelan was vice chairman for five years and president for four more
before being named chairman and chief executive in 1984.
   Phelan had said previously he didn't plan to be chairman for
life, but he had been expected to remain at least until 1992, the
200th anniversary of the stock market's founding by two dozen
traders gathered under a buttonwood tree on Wall Street.
   ``I think he's been marvelous,'' said Alan C. ``Ace'' Greenberg,
chairman of the investment firm Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. ``He came from
the floor. He understands the business. It helped.''
   ``We've seen everything from electronic trading pressures to the
market crash to new products and innovations to congressional
pressure,'' added Wall Street veteran Jack Barbanel, president of
First Global Asset Management Inc. ``I think he has done a very
superb job addressing most of the issues.''
   The most contentious topic lately is the price zigzags that have
characterized some trading days, especially last Oct. 13 when the
Dow Jones lost 190 points. Some traders blame volatility on program
trading, a practice in which millions of dollars worth of stocks
are traded instantaneously by computers.
   Phelan has been reluctant to restrict program trading, although
he has limited it during heavy price fluctuations. Last fall he
commissioned a panel to study volatility and the role of program
trading.
   Phelan worked for his father's securities firm while at Adelphi
University on Long Island. He served with the Marines in Korea
before returning to the exchange floor. Of his vacation job working
for his father at age 16, he said:
   ``At the end of the summer, when I was finished the job he said,
`Well, how did you enjoy Wall Street?' and I said, `I'll tell you
one thing, I don't know what I'm going to do in life but I'm
certainly not going to work on Wall Street.'''

<HEAD>Chrysler Shutting Down St. Louis, Jefferson Avenue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. will shut down its car assembly
plant in St. Louis and lay off 3,700 workers in a move that's
likely to worsen already souring relations between the company and
its union.
   Thursday's announcement, the latest in a series of moves by U.S.
automakers to cut capacity in the face of slumping sales, makes it
likely that job security will be the union's top priority when it
opens contract negotiations with the nation's Big Three automakers
this summer.
   Chrysler said its St. Louis No. 1 plant will close Sept. 21, one
week after its existing contract with the United Auto Workers
expires. As previously announced, Chrysler will eliminate one shift
at the plant on Feb. 12.
   The company said it will transfer production of the Dodge
Daytona to its Sterling Heights, Mich., assembly plant, and shift
assembly of the Chrysler LeBaron coupe and convertible to its
Newark, Del., plant.
   The St. Louis plant will be the third Chrysler has closed since
late 1988. It was announced just one day before the company closes
a Detroit plant and puts 1,700 other workers on indefinite layoff.
   The move angered United Auto Workers officials.
   ``Workers and their unions don't design the cars or develop the
marketing plans,'' UAW President Owen Bieber and Vice President
Stan Marshall, head of the union's Chrysler department, said in a
statement.
   ``Senior management calls those shots, but when they
miscalculate or screw up, they all stay in place while the workers
are told to hit the street,'' they said.
   Chrysler spokesman Doug Nicoll said the timing of the St. Louis
plant closing was dictated by the UAW contract, which expires Sept.
14.
   That pact doesn't allow the company to close a plant because of
product transfers. It says plants may be shut down only if sales of
its products slump badly.
   Chrysler used that as justification for today's closing of its
Jefferson Avenue assembly plant in Detroit. That factory makes
Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon subcompact cars, whose sales have
fallen by more than 50 percent from their heyday of about 208,000
in 1986.
   The UAW has contested that closing, saying Chrysler didn't do
enough to keep the design of the small cars fresh and market them
properly.
   Some of the 1,700 workers laid off from Jefferson Avenue will be
offered jobs at Jefferson North, a plant under construction next to
the existing factory. That plant will begin producing a
sport-utility vehicle in late 1992.
   Chrysler is shutting the St. Louis plant in two stages.
Beginning Feb. 12, it will eliminate one shift, putting 1,900 of
its 3,700 workers on indefinite layoff. In September, it will lay
off the remaining 1,800 workers and close the plant.
   The announcement couldn't have come at a worst moment, said
Harley Shaiken, a labor professor at the University of California
at San Diego.
   ``I think this coming on top of Jefferson is going to create a
lot of anxiety and hostility in the industry going into
negotiations,'' he said.
   The UAW opens talks with General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co.
and Chrysler in July. UAW President Owen Bieber said negotiating
priorities will be worked out at a special union convention in May
in Kansas City, Mo., but job security was more than likely to be
the top issue.
   Michigan State University labor professor Dale Brickner agreed.
   ``Job security is going to be the barn burner,'' Brickner said.
``If we had strikes this fall, one or more, it certainly would not
surprise me.''
   Nicoll, the Chrysler spokesman, said the Delaware and Michigan
plants would be idled in November to retool for the new cars and
would resume production in December.
   Employment at each plant will increase by a few hundred workers,
with laid off St. Louis workers getting the first cracks at the new
jobs.
   The St. Louis closing is one in a series of temporary or
indefinite shutdowns or production cuts at Big Three assembly
plants nationwide. About 15,400 workers will have lost their jobs
at 11 GM or Chrysler assembly plants because of indefinite layoffs
between January and September.
   ``This isn't the last,'' Shaiken said. ``I think we will see
something else at GM, particularly as contract time approaches.''
   The closures come as auto sales slump and capacity at
Japanese-owned plants grows. Within the last year, Honda Motor Co.
Ltd. has opened a second assembly plant in Ohio and Nissan Motor
Corp. has announced a huge expansion of its factory in Smyrna, Tenn.
   Since 1986, the best year in automotive sales history, GM and
Chrysler have lost market share while Ford and Japanese companies,
with the help of their new U.S. plants, have increased their shares.

   Workers at Chrysler Corp.'s No. 1 plant in
suburban Fenton have worked only two weeks since mid-October, so
they weren't too surprised by the announcement that the plant will
be closed permanently in September.
   ``In the back of my mind, I kind of thought this was going to
happen,'' said Dennis Moser of Festus, who has been at Plant No. 1
for 24{ years.
   ``I thought they were leading up to something and I knew they
would have an announcement, but I thought it would be in March.''
   Ed Boyer, president of United Auto Workers Local 136, was
``disappointed and frustrated'' at Thursday's news.
   ``I don't know what the next step's going to be right now,''
Boyer said. ``We've got to get some answers to some very important
questions that we don't have right now.''
   National union leaders in Detroit said they didn't understand
why the St. Louis workers have to be the ``sacrificial victims of
difficulties in the market.''
   In a joint statement, UAW President Owen Bieber and Vice
President Stan Marshall said, ``Workers and their unions don't
design the cars or develop the marketing plans.''
   The nation's No. 3 automaker said it will close the St. Louis
No. 1 plant Sept. 21 and transfer production of the Dodge Daytona
and Chrysler LeBaron to factories in Newark, Del., and Sterling
Heights, Mich.
   No work has been done at the plant since Dec. 18.
   Plant No. 1, a 2.5 million square-feet facility capable of
producing 225,000 cars a year, has been in operation more than 30
years. The first car, a four-door Plymouth Belvedere, rolled off
the assembly line on Oct. 20, 1959.
   Chrysler also operates a neighboring facility in Fenton, Plant
No. 2, which makes mini-vans. None of the estimated 3,500 jobs
there were affected by the announcement.
   To prepare for the permanent shutdown, Chrysler will cut
production at Plant No. 1 to one shift Feb. 12. By September, all
3,700 employees will be laid off, although they will have first
chance at several hundred new jobs to be created at the Delaware
and Michigan plants.
   ``I'd have to go, although I'd go kicking and screaming for
sure,'' said Moser, who is less than six years away from qualifying
for full retirement. ``I've got a whole section of my life tied up
with the Chrysler Corporation and I don't know if they've given
anything back.''
   Moser and other auto workers are blaming the layoff on
Chrysler's strategy of shifting production to Mexico, where labor
costs are much cheaper.
   ``Anywhere they can squeeze a penny, they'll squeeze it,'' said
autoworker Rich Bolzenius of Union, a rear window molding fitter
who has been with Chrysler for 13 years. ``They're always trying to
make the worker look like the bad guy because he's not a team
player.
   ``But the reality of it is, the team concept is just a company
concept that the workers follow to make it better for the company.''

<HEAD>Gillette Plans First Manufacturing Venture in U.S.S.R.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gillette Co., already an importer of razor blades
into the Soviet Union, hopes to set up its first manufacturing
plant there in a few years.
   Gillette said Thursday it had signed a memorandum of intent with
the Leninets group, based in Leningrad, to establish a $50 million
blade-making facility.
   Leninets employs some 40,000 people in the manufacture and sale
of consumer products, as well as scientific, ecological and
research activities.
   ``I think that the Leninets and Gillette joint experience will
help solve the supply problem in our market with such vital
products and Leningraders will be among the first to have access to
these goods,'' Anatoliy Turchak, director-general of Leninets, said
in a statement.
   Gillette is trying to find an existing facility in the Soviet
Union that can be transformed into a plant that could produce 800
million blades a year, company spokesman David Fausch said. That
would make the plant the fourth largest blade facility in the world
for Gillette, he said.
   Gillette, the world leader in the razor market, would hold a
majority stake in the plant.
   The company hopes to sign a definitive agreement for the project
later this year. The project could be completed within 20 months of
an agreement, Fausch said.
   Under the deal, blades would be made using Gillette technology,
but the brand name of the products has not been decided, Fausch
said.
   Fausch noted that Gillette has been importing blades into the
Soviet Union for the past few years from a plant in India.

<TEXT>
   Utilities supplying Federated and Allied
department stores say they're disappointed but not surprised by a
bankruptcy judge's refusal of requests for deposits totaling up to
$20 million.
   ``It's about what we expected,'' John Ducker, a lawyer for Puget
Sound Power &amp; Light Co., said Thursday after U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
J. Vincent Aug Jr. refused to order the Campeau Corp. retailers to
post guarantees.
   Aug said if the retailers' financial condition deteriorates, he
would require a one-month utility deposit. But he said the 596
utilities serving Federated and Allied businesses nationwide
haven't shown the companies won't have the cash to pay bills on
time.
   Also Thursday, bankruptcy court Trustee Conrad J. Morgenstern
announced the formation of committees of unsecured creditors for
Federated and Allied. The committees include representatives from
Liz Claiborne Inc. and Sony Corp. of America, among others.
   Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp. filed
Jan. 15 for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the
Federal Bankruptcy Act, listing $7.5 billion in debts.
   Cory Lipoff, a lawyer for Federated and Allied, said utilities
demanded deposits equal to two months' bills.
   ``We are confident that we can make our payments,'' Lipoff said.
``With few exceptions, the debtors are current with all their
bills.''
   Aug advised utilities to ``sit tight'' until Feb. 14, when he
will hold a hearing on whether to approve $700 million in bank
credits to keep the store groups operating during reorganization.
   ``We do have companies that have cash piling up ... that don't
have to tap their working capital if their creditors don't panic,''
the judge said.
   But Leon Mener, a lawyer for Consolidated Edison Co. of New
York, said he was worried that Federated and Allied would run out
of money before they emerge from bankruptcy court protection.
   ``We're worried about those final bills at the end of the
proceeding, when we're going to get stuck like we got stuck
before,'' Mener said. He said he thought the two chains could match
the two-month deposit another retailer, LJ Hooker Corp., paid after
filing for protection from creditors.
   Ducker disputed Lipoff's argument that the retailers have enough
assets readily convertible to cash to qualify for normal treatment
by their utilities.
   Under questioning by Ducker, Federated and Allied Vice President
and Treasurer Mark Kennedy said he didn't know whether the company
has any assets or inventory that aren't pledged as security for
past debts or the $700 million in credits.
   ``I'm sure there would be one asset unencumbered,'' Kennedy
said. ``I think my desk is free and clear.''
   Aug also approved a request by Federated and Allied to renew a
$300,000-a-year contract with the recruiter who is searching for a
chairman and chief executive officer to replace John W. Burden III,
who retired Wednesday. Aug approved resumption of severance pay and
about $20,000 in monthly retirement benefits that had been
suspended.
   Meanwhile, Federated said efforts to sell Bloomingdale's,
considered by many as the group's most attractive department store
chain, have been delayed and may be called off.
   ``It's a decision that should be made only after the creditors'
committee have a chance to review an analysis of whether there
would be more value for (Federated) by retaining Bloomingdale's or
by selling it,'' Federated spokeswoman Carol Sanger said.

<HEAD>Drexel Burnham Lambert Settles with State for $1 Million</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. agreed to pay the
state $1 million in a settlement, the latest agreement stemming
from the Wall Street firm's guilty plea to securities fraud charges.
   Massachusetts became the 41st state to reach such an agreement
with Drexel. The settlement announced Thursday was the largest ever
paid to the state in a securities matter, according to Secretary of
State Michael J. Connolly.
   Drexel pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in New York last
September to six felonies and paid $650 million to settle a range
of fraud allegations stemming from the government's lengthy
investigation of insider trading on Wall Street.
   Drexel also agreed to dozens of administrative changes and
unprecedented federal supervision in settling civil charges with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Under the settlement, Drexel paid $300 million in fines to the
government and set aside $350 million for investors who can prove
they were harmed by the firm's actions. Those who may be entitled
to restitution include people who bought stocks in about 20
allegedly fraudulent transactions cited by the SEC.
   The settlement with Massachusetts is one of the largest the firm
reached with states that have settled so far. Drexel paid Illinois
about $1.2 million. The lowest settlements were about $50,000, said
a company spokesman.
   The settlement with Massachusetts brings the total amount Drexel
has paid states to $8.3 million.
   ``We're pleased we were able to settle it and now we can go
about our business,'' said Steven Anreder, a Drexel spokesman.
   The $1 million settlement will go into the state's general fund,
Connolly said.
   Drexel originally offered Massachusetts $275,000, Connolly said,
but the state held out for more.
   ``Their record settlement makes clear Massachusetts' firm
commitment to enforce the law and combat fraud,'' Connolly said,
adding lower amount was ``simply not adequate compensation.''
   Settling with the states relieves the firm of possible
litigation, and frees state regulators from having to investigate
the firm's trading activities from 1984 to 1986, when the SEC
alleged the fraud occurred.
   It also generally preserves the firm's ability to underwrite
securities and do other business in the states. Most states can
revoke a company's right to do business if the firm is convicted or
admits to committing a felony. Drexel abandoned the retail
brokerage business last year.
   In Massachusetts, the agreement includes a stipulation that
Drexel must not solicit any new retail trade without first
notifying the state Securities Division and demonstrating
compliance procedures are in place.
   The firm also cannot sponsor private placements to individuals,
and must work with the Securities Division to identify any state
investors injured by the illegal sale of Drexel junk bonds. Victims
would be entitled to place claims with the $350 million
compensation fund Drexel established.
   In addition, Drexel must hire an independent consultant to
scrutinize company policies and submit compliance reports; hire an
ombudsman to receive and investigate complaints; finance annual
audits by the state Securities Division and establish an oversight
committee to review its internal procedures.
   Connolly said he did not know whether any Massachusetts
residents were hurt by Drexel sales.

<HEAD>Hilton Board Passes on Buyout Bids, Restructuring Plans; Stock
Falls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hilton Hotels Corp. has hung out a
do not disturb sign for the moment, deciding to pass up buyout
offers for now while trying to negotiate a better deal or come up
with a restructuring plan.
   The lodging-casino concern, which put itself up for sale last
summer, said its directors met Tuesday and Wednesday to consider
bids and restructuring proposals. The board adjourned ``without
taking definitive action,'' Hilton said Thursday.
   Its stock, which had traded as high as $115.50 a share last
August, tumbled $3.25 to $58.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Hilton said its board ``instructed its financial advisers and
management to further develop the acquisition proposals and the
alternate strategies and to report back to the board on these
matter within the next several weeks.''
   Hilton has effectively been up for sale since settlement of a
dispute over the estate of founder Conrad Hilton last May. The
company formally invited offers in August for all or part of its
lodging and casino operations.
   At the time, analysts estimated the 48 million shares of Hilton
common stock might fetch $120 a share or more. Hilton General
Counsel William C. Lebo said expressions of interest had come in
from buyers worldwide, particulary in Asia.
   Since then, the atmosphere for deals, particularly those
involving real estate, has soured.
   Real estate prices softened. The pilots' bid for UAL Corp. fell
apart because of inadequate bank financing. Campeau Corp. made
bankruptcy filings due to heavy debt. And the junk bond market, a
major source of takeover financing, went into a tailspin.
   The offers for Hilton came in far lower than expected, with
apparently no bids from Japanese buyers despite strong previous
interest from the Japanese in such ``trophy'' buildings as Hilton's
Waldorf Astoria.
   The Wall Street Journal reported in late December bids were in
the $90 a share range, causing the stock price to plunge. It fell
further on rumors that bids from Chicago's JMB Realty Corp. and
others had been lowered or withdrawn.
   In addition to a sale, one option available to Hilton would be a
recapitalization, in which the company would borrow in order to pay
a big dividend to shareholders.
   Michael Mueller of Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, one
of the analysts who had predicted a $120-a-share price for Hilton
last summer, said Thursday he believed an outright sale of the
company still would bring shareholders about $80 to $85 a share.
   He said Hilton's statement was a positive sign for shareholders
to the extent it indicated a deal might still be made.
   ``It appears the acquisition offers they have received so far
are below what the board would like or the terms are unacceptable,
but that negotiations could still produce an acceptable deal,'' he
said.
   The company closed its two-paragraph statement by stressing
again that it could give no assurances that the directors would
sell, restructure or recapitalize the company at all.

   Currency dealers described the day's trading as slow, with many
market players refraining from making any major moves as they were
awaiting the release of U.S. jobless figures for January, due out
in Washington later today.
   Some economists predicted the U.S. civilian unemployment rate
would rise to 5.4 percent from 5.3 percent in December.
   The market is also closely watching the meeting of the Soviet

   An estimated 550 million shares changed hands on the first

   Fans and foes of a plan to cut Social Security
taxes are wooing the American Association of Retired Persons in
hopes of enlisting the clout and credibility of nation's largest
senior citizen group.
   Budget director Richard G. Darman, an ardent opponent of the tax
cut, on Thursday appealed to the AARP's legislative council to
``draw upon the enormous respect that you command, that we do not
command'' to fight the proposal.
   Darman's ally, Social Security Commissioner Gwendolyn King,
later told the group, ``I'm not going to press you, but I do want
you to know how important it is that you not leave me out here by
myself, that you not cop out of this debate.''
   ``If you've got something to say on it, please say it loud and
clear.''
   At issue is a proposal by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.,
to roll back the Social Security tax increase that took effect Jan.
1 and further reduce the levy next year. A principal aim of the
plan is to prevent the government from using surplus Social
Security taxes to make the overall federal deficit appear smaller.
   Advocacy groups for the elderly generally have welcomed the
attention Moynihan's proposal is focusing on the need to protect
the Social Security trust funds. But they have been wary of his
tax-cut plan, voicing fears about its potential effects on benefits
and on the financial soundness of the system.
   Mrs. King's declaration that Congress should ``keep your hands
off Social Security'' drew warm applause from the AARP audience.
   Moynihan, widely respected as a leading advocate for Social
Security, visited the AARP's legislative conference earlier this
week in an effort to enlist their support. He told council members,
``how you decide will have great consequence. It will make a
difference.''
   He tried to assure the group his plan would pose ``no risk to
benefits at any time'' and was needed to keep the trust funds from
being misused.
   Moynihan was accompanied by Robert Myers, a former chief actuary
of the Social Security Administration, who told the group the
senator's plan would help keep the giant retirement system on sound
financial ground.
   The AARP's 38-member legislative council was expected to forward
its Social Security policy recommendations Friday to the group's
executive committee, which sets policy for the organization of 31
million members.
   AARP's council received the arguments from both sides of the
Social Security issue politely, and members expressed personal
opinions on both sides of the issue.
   Dennis Crites, a council member from Norman, Okla., said
Moynihan's plan drew attention to the budget problems, but ``if it
develops a life of its own, it may be damaging.''
   Council member Lou Schwartz of Teaneck, N.J., said he liked the
plan because it would ``lower the taxes on those who can least
afford to pay it and open the door to have the people that can
afford to pay it pay it.''

<HEAD>Weyerhaeuser Earnings Fall After Restructuring Charge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TACOMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Weyerhaeuser Co. reported it lost $128.7
million in the fourth quarter after running up $461 million in
restructuring costs before taxes.
   The wood products company said Thursday the loss for the quarter
ended Dec. 31 amounted to 65 cents per share on sales of $2.6
billion. That compared with a profit of $155.3 million or 73 cents
a share on sales of $2.4 billion for the same period of 1988.
   For the year, Weyerhaeuser earned $341.1 million or $1.56 a
share on sales of $10.1 billion, compared with profits of $565.6
million or $2.68 a share on sales of $9.3 billion in 1988.
   Full-year results reflected $497 million in restructuring costs.
   During the last half of 1989, the company sold its milk carton,
gypsum wallboard, most of its hardwood paneling and its nursery
products businesses for a pretax gain of $47 million.
   The company said Thursday the restructuring charges were due
principally to the closure or modification of some forest products
facilities and other businesses; a scaling down of real estate
operations; changes in operations of its Westwood Shipping Lines,
personal care products and containerboard packaging businesses and
the planned sale of Weyerhaeuser's savings and loan business.
   George Weyerhaeuser, chairman and chief executive officer, said
the restructure charge will have no adverse effect on the company's
financial strength, but rather improves the company's
competitiveness.
   Weyerhaeuser said weakness in fine paper markets and high costs
for maintenance in pulp and paper operations in the fourth quarter
were partially offset by strong export markets and a runup in
structural panel prices in October and November.

   The stock market was mostly higher in early
trading today, rebounding from earlier lows following the
government's release of employment data for January.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 3.83 points to
2,590.09 at 10 a.m. EST, 30 minutes after the opening bell.
   Declining issues outpaced advancers by a margin of about 9 to 7
on the New York Stock Exchange, with 520 issues down, 406 up and
539 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 21.40 million shares.
   The Labor Department reported today that the nation's
unemployment rate held steady at 5.3 percent in January as the
economy began the new year producing 275,000 new jobs. That was
higher than market expectations for about 160,000 non-farm payroll
jobs.
   Analysts said the market first reacted negatively behind a
sliding bond market but bounced back after digesting the data.
   ``The employment report was essentially a non-event,'' said
Larry Wachtel, analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   ``Job growth was overstated given the seasonal factors involved
and manufacturing employment continued to fall. And to the degree
the market was concerned about a recession, we now have more
information that there is not recession,'' he said.
   The government said the strong job growth figures might be
exaggerated because warm January weather that followed a bitter
cold December made it tough to seasonally adjust job totals for
construction and other industries affected by weather.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
up 0.07 to 181.59.
   At the American Stock Exchange the market value index was down
0.15 to 351.35.
   On Thursday, the Dow Jones industrials closed down 4.28 points
at 2,586.26.
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 11 to 8 on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 881 issues up, 651 down and 435
unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 154.58 million
shares, down from 189.66 million in the previous session.

   The nation's unemployment rate held steady at
5.3 percent in January as the economy began the new year by
producing 275,000 new jobs, the government said today.
   It was the eighth consecutive month with no change in the
unemployment level.
   But the Labor Department said the strong job growth figures
might be overstated because warm January weather that followed a
bitter cold December made it tough to seasonally adjust job totals
for construction and other industries affected by weather.
   Delays in the reporting of post-Christmas layoffs in retail
trade also may have skewed the numbers.
   The manufacturing slump added to the overall slowdown in the
nation's economy last year, and today's report _ the first
comprehensive look at economic activity in 1990 _ indicated that
the sector's lackluster performance is continuing this year.
   Factory jobs dropped 112,000 last month, with 90,000 of the
losses suffered by the struggling auto industry. It was the 10th
straight month manufacturing jobs declined.
   Still, analysts saw the economy's ability to absorb those
declines without a hike in the jobless rate as an encouraging sign.
   ``The auto industry has taken a really big hit, but the rest of
the economy is marching along, and has virtually swallowed up the
manufacturing losses,'' said Robert Dederick, chief economist for
the Northern Trust Co. of Chicago.
   ``It certainly indicates that the economy is weathering the
storm. It has favorable implications for later on,'' Dederick said.
   Manufacturing losses were especially felt in Michigan, where the
jobless rate jumped to 8.4 percent in January, up from 7.2 percent
in December. That was the largest unemployment increase in the 11
large industrial states surveyed by the government.
   However, the government said many of the laid-off auto workers
have been recalled since the survey of business establishments last
month to gauge job growth.
   Construction employers reported a gain of 104,000 jobs during
last month's mild weather after a 50,000-job loss during December.
   Mining industries, which includes oil drilling, added 1,000 jobs.
   Meanwhile, the service-producing industries, which carried the
economy last year, continued to demonstrate healthy gains this
year. Those industries reported 284,000 new jobs, with 48,000 of
them created in health services.
   Other industries of the service sector posting large gains were
transportation, with 27,000 new jobs; wholesale trade, 24,00 new
jobs; retail trade, 127,000. The last figure, though, is likely
overstated because of problems factoring in seasonal adjustments
after Christmas.
   Average hourly earnings, sometimes an advanced warning of
inflationary pressures on the economy, were up just 0.1 percent in
January to $9.84. The average work week for production and
non-supervisory workers edged up 0.1 hour last month to 34.6 hours,
but in manufacturing, the average work week was unchanged at 40.7
hours.
   The government said that the civilian labor force, the number of
people with jobs or actively seeking employment, declined by
149,000 last month to 124 million. The number of Americans with
jobs fell by 25,000 to 117.8 million.
   There were few major shifts in the jobless rate among major
demographic groups last month. The biggest change among Hispanics,
where unemployment fell from 8.5 percent in December to 7.1 percent
in January.
   The rates among other groups were:
   _Adult white men, 4.0 percent, up from 3.9 percent in December.
   _Adult white women, 4.0 percent, down from 4.1 percent.
   _White teen-agers, 12.4 percent, up from 11.9 percent.
   _All blacks, 11.3 percent, down from 11.8 percent.
   _Adult black men, 11.2 percent, up from 10.8 percent.
   _Adult black women, 9.2 percent, down from 10.0 percent.
   _Black teen-agers, 26.7 percent, down from 30.7 percent.
   In a separate calculation of unemployment that counts members of
the armed services stationed in the UnIted States, the January
jobless rate was 5.2 percent, down from 5.3 percent in December.

   The stock market climbed higher in early trading
today, erasing early losses following the government's release of
employment data for January.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 17.57 points to
2,603.83 at 11 a.m. EST. The blue-chip indicator was 3.83 points
higher an hour ago after opening lower.
   Advancing issues lead decliners by a margin of about 9 to 5 on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 781 issues up, 442 down and 507
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 55.57 million shares.
   The Labor Department reported today that the nation's
unemployment rate held steady at 5.3 percent in January as the
economy began the new year producing 275,000 new jobs. That was
higher than market expectations of about 160,000 new non-farm
payroll jobs.
   But the government said the strong job growth figures might be
exaggerated because warm January weather that followed a bitter
cold December made it tough to seasonally adjust job totals for
construction and other industries affected by weather.
   Traders said the market first reacted negatively behind a
sliding bond market but bounced back after digesting the data.
   ``The employment report was essentially a non-event,'' said
Larry Wachtel, analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``Job
growth was overstated given the seasonal factors involved.''
   While special factors affected the jobs data, analysts said the
figures suggest sluggish growth without a recession.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was

<TEXT>
   Most grain and soybean futures prices slipped
quietly lower in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade,
extending the modest declines posted in the previous session.
   The selling reflected continued improvement in crop soil
moisture levels in both the United States and South America.
Precipitation was widespread across the Midwest and more was
expected for the weekend. Moisture also was predicted for this
weekend in the U.S. winter wheat country.
   The early losses were limited, though, by scattered buying
linked to Thursday's weekly Agriculture Department grain exports
report, which showed unexpectedly strong export sales of both
soybeans and corn last week.
   In early trading, wheat futures were \ cent to 1{ cents lower
with the contract for delivery in March at $3.75 a bushel; corn
futures were unchanged to { cent lower with March at $2.37{ a
bushel; oats were { cent to } cent lower with March at $1.35 a
bushel; soybeans were { cent lower to { cent higher with March at
$5.59} a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures declined in early
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle futures were .05 cent lower to .08 cent higher with
February at 79 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent lower to
.15 cent higher with March at 82.77 cents a pound; live hogs were
.10 cent to .55 cent lower with February at 48.20 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .30 cent to .80 cent lower with February
at 49.40 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled higher on Thursday. Pork futures
retreated.

<DATELINE>SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roche Holding Ltd., a large
Swiss health care company, on Friday announced an agreement to
invest $2.1 billion in Genentech Inc., making it the largest
shareholder of the biotechnology company.
   Under the agreement, Roche will invest $492 million in Genentech
and buy half its stock for $36 a share, 65 percent higher than
Thursday's closing stock price. After the transaction, Roche will
own 60 percent of the 112 million shares outstanding.
   However, both companies emphasized that Genentech will remain a
publicly traded company.
   Genentech's board of directors on Friday approved the agreement,
which will result in Genentech shareholders receiving $36 a share
in cash for half their shares.
   The rest of Genentech's outstanding shares will be converted
into new redeemable common stock, but it will be redeemable at
Roche's option. Roche will have the right to exercise its option,
for all of Genentech's outstanding shares, at $38 a share before
Dec. 31, 1990, and at $39 a share from Jan. 1, 1991 to March 31,
1991.
   After that, the price becomes $40 a share and goes up by $1.25 a
share every quarter to $60 a share on April 1, 1995. The redemption
right expires on June 30, 1995.
   Two weeks ago, Genentech, a leader in the biotechnology field,
reported a complete turnaround in fourth-quarter earnings, posting
a $15 million profit after losing the same amount in 1988. For
1989, Genentech posted net income of $44 million, or 51 cents a
share.
   The company, based in South San Francisco, said sales in the
fourth quarter of its heart drug Activase jumped 63 percent to
$56.7 million.
   Genentech also markets a human growth hormone sold under the
brand name of Protrofin, whose sales rose to $34.3 million in the
fourth quarter.
   ``Roche's $2.1 billion total investment will be best served if
Genentech continues to operate in the manner that led to its
impressive success in such a short time,'' said Fritz Gerber,
chairman and chief executive officer of Roche, in a statement.
   Roche, based in Basle, Switzerland, has worldwide sales of $6.5
billion, with facilities in 52 countries. Roche has done business
in the United States since 1905.
   The transaction is structured as a merger and will be put before
Genentech shareholders for approval at a planned April meeting.

<HEAD>China, Chicago Board Of Trade Agree On Futures Markets Cooperation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Board of Trade signed a memo of
understanding Friday to assist China's preparations in establishing
what would be the socialist world's first agricultural futures
market.
   Under the memo signed with the Research Institute of Commmerce,
a division of the Commerce Ministry, the Board of Trade would
provide educational assistance on futures trading.
   In turn, the ministry agreed to introduce Chinese agricultural
enterprises to the Board of Trade _ the world's largest futures
exchange _ and the China National Cereals Trade Corporation will
prepare to participate in futures trading in Chicago.
   ``In China approximately 65 million tons of agricultural
commodities circulate in the free market each year and are
therefore subject to price risk,'' said William D. Grossman, vice
president and managing director of the Board of Trade's
Asia-Pacific office in Tokyo. ``As a result, the conditions are
ripe to learn about futures trading.''
   Futures are agreements to buy or sell a product _ such as
agricultural commodities like rice, wheat or frozen concentrated
orange juice _ at a set price on a specific future date.
   Because the seller is guaranteed that price regardless of
subsequent market fluctuations, producers frequently use the
futures market to hedge the investment in their crop. Speculators
also use futures to bet on price movements.
   Most of the 400 million tons of grain Chinese farmers produce
annually is contracted to the state at a set price. However, after
meeting their contracts farmers are allowed to sell any excess
produce on the free markets.
   China's constant problems with shortages and gluts _ an aspect
of central planning _ and poor regulation of the free markets have
led to wild fluctuations in market prices, worsening supply-demand
imbalances.
   In early 1988, when reformers still held the balance of power in
Beijing, plans were announced to set up experimental futures
markets in several Chinese cities. But at the end of 1988, when
conservatives exerted control over the overheated economy, the
government postponed plans for the futures market.
   Grossman said he had been assured by Commerce Minister Hu Ping
that establishment of the markets had been delayed due to
inadequate preparation and resources, not for ideological reasons.
   In the past, China branded futures markets as a form of
capitalist speculation. The nation's current conservative leaders
have stressed that market forces always will play a secondary role
in the state-run economy.
   Grossman said in an interview that the first market, confined to
wheat trading in the central China city of Zhengzhou, was ready for
final approval last spring but was again ``put in the bottom of the
in-box'' following the political turmoil that climaxed with the
bloody military crackdown against the pro-democracy movement last
June.
   He said the Zhengzhou market could be opened in time for the
winter wheat harvest in May or June.
   Zhang Qipan, director of the Research Institute of Commerce, was
less optimistic, saying the market still was in the planning stage
and could open this year.
   ``This is an experiment. If it succeeds, then it's possible we
might do the same thing in a few other places,'' Zhang said.
``Right now we still don't have the right conditions for a futures
market.''
   Grossman said the Zhengzhou market will not be a true futures
market, where trading is done with standardized contracts of large
set volumes. Instead, it will be more of an informal cash
wholesaling market.
   Individual farmers will not participate and speculation will be
prohibited, he said. Some 20 to 30 organizations will take part in
daily auctions, with grain trading corporations and feed mills
selling to large food processors and distributors.
   The Board of Trade will have only an advisory role and will play
no part in operating the market. In return, the board will be
introduced to potential Chinese traders for the Chicago market.
   ``We are the world's largest futures exchange market,'' Grossman
said. ``We have a vested interest in seeing such markets develop
properly around the world.''

<HEAD>Jefferson Avenue Workers Say Farewell to Old Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Autoworkers, some with more than a
quarter-century of work at Chrysler Corp.'s Jefferson Avenue
factory, drifted out of the old assembly plant Friday as it shut
down after producing 8.3 million cars.
   Production of Chrysler's Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon ended
Friday morning, when a gray Omni with a gray interior and a manual
transmission rolled off the assembly line. Some of the 1,700
workers being laid off indefinitely hoped they would go back to
work in late 1991 at the company's Jefferson North plant, being
built next to the closed factory.
   Shortly after the last car rolled off the line, Ralph Winchester
of Warren, Mich., who worked in the final inspection portion of the
plant, walked out of the factory and into a gray, snowy morning.
   ``I walked around a little bit,'' he said, and thought about his
25 years at the Jefferson Avenue plant, one of the industry's
oldest. Winchester said he hoped he would be recalled when training
begins for Jefferson North, which is to begin producing a
sport-utility vehicle in late 1992.
   ``I didn't get any guarantees,'' he said.
   Winchester, like others, will head to the unemployment line
instead of the assembly line Monday.
   ``I'm just going to get settled and see what happens,'' he said
as he crossed the six lanes of Jefferson Avenue, which splits the
83-year-old plant in two.
   Buildings on both sides of the street will be demolished, and
Chrysler will incorporate the land on the north side of Jefferson
into the new plant. The company hasn't decided what it will do with
more than 100 acres on the south side of Jefferson.
   Another worker, Henry Anderson of Detroit, also closed out 25
years of working for Chrysler. He was laid off once before, when
the company's Dodge Main assembly plant in Hamtramck, Mich., was
shut down in January 1980.
   He said he's had enough.
   ``I'm going to school for robotics and TV and radio repair,''
Anderson said.
   The laid off workers will be eligible to draw from a variety of
funds which could bring benefits while on layoff to as much as 95
percent of their straight-time pay while they were working.
   Officials of United Auto Workers union Local 7, which represents
the Jefferson Avenue workers, doubt if the funds will be healthy
enough to maintain that level by the time retraining for Jefferson
North begins.
   They said layoffs the automaker already has announced for later
this year will boost the number of eligible people _ those on
indefinite layoff _ drawing against the funds. Between now and the
end of March, Chrysler will lay off indefinitely nearly 6,000
workers.
   Jefferson Avenue is the second plant Chrysler has shut down
since 1988, but it won't be the last this year. On Thursday, the
company announced it would close its St. Louis car plant in
mid-September.
   That closing will bring to seven the number of assembly plants
Chrysler and General Motors Corp. will have closed in three years.
Ford Motor Co., meantime, has avoided closing plants by keeping its
car and truck sales healthy and eliminating large amounts of
overtime it used instead of opening a new plant.
   While the domestic automakers slash their production, Japanese
companies have been adding to their U.S. production in plants they
own either wholly or partly.
   Since 1988, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. and Chrysler opened a plant
in Normal, Ill., Toyota Motor Corp. began production at its own
plant in Georgetown, Ky., Subaru of America and Isuzu Motors Ltd.
opened a joint car and truck manufacturing plant in Lafayette,
Ind., and Honda Motor Co. Ltd. opened its second U.S. plant in East
Liberty, Ohio.

   A zoologist accused of unleashing a computer
virus that crippled computers in England two months ago with a fake
information disk on AIDS was arrested on a fugitive warrant in Ohio.
   Joseph W. Popp was arrested Thursday and is being held on a
federal fugitive warrant. He is charged in warrants issued by
Scotland Yard in London with blackmail and extortion.
   During an initial court appearance here today, Popp, 39, told
U.S. Magistrate Joseph W. Bartunek that he is under a
psychiatrist's care and must take drugs for a mental condition.
   Bartunek said he would schedule another hearing after two
psychiatrists evaluate Popp to see whether he is competent to face
further proceedings. A date was not set.
   Popp, a zoologist who worked for the World Health Organization,
is from Willowick, about 10 miles east of Cleveland, said defense
attorney John P. Kilroy. It was not immediately clear whether Popp
is still affiliated with the organization.
   The warrant alleges Popp distributed about 20,000
computer-crippling disks from London around Dec. 11. The disks were
labeled ``AIDS Information Introductory Diskette.''
   The U.S. attorney's office in Cleveland said the disks had
information on acquired immune deficiency syndrome for use by
hospitals, researchers and others.
   But authorities said the disks, when inserted into personal
computers by unsuspecting recipients, halted accessibility to any
other information in the computer.
   At the end of the program, the disk asked the computer user for
a leasing fee of up to $378, then printed an invoice with a Panama
address where money was to be sent, federal prosecutors said.
Computer owners were told that the rogue program they had inserted
in their computer would stop the machine from functioning unless
the money was paid.
   At the time the diskette began causing problems in early
December, authorities in London said it had been received by users
in Norway, Sweden, Belgium, Denmark and California as well as
Britain. Scotland Yard said at least 10 British computers were
affected. Later in the month, a company in Bahrain, in the Midle
East, also reported getting one of the disks but said it was
discovered before it did any damage.

   Shares finished higher Friday on London's Stock

   At the London close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index was up 9.3 points, or 0.4 percent, at 2,355.1
points.
   For a large part of the session, roughly 30 percent of the

   Volume was a light 487.4 million shares, little changed from the
472.3 million traded Thursday.
   Wall Street's Dow Jones industrial average rallied during the
European afternoon to stand nearly 30 points higher by the close of
London's session.
   But London stocks only ``grudgingly edged better'' said one

   Stock prices eased off their highs as activity
slowed in afternoon trading.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 21.17 points to
2,607.43 at 3 p.m. EST. The blue-chip indicator was 26.58 points
higher an hour earlier.
   Advancing issues lead decliners by a margin of about 13 to 7 on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 965 issues up, 516 down and 452
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 138.72 million shares.
   The Labor Department reported today that the nation's
unemployment rate held steady at 5.3 percent in January as the
economy began the new year producing 275,000 new jobs. That was
higher than market expectations of about 160,000 new non-farm
payroll jobs.
   But the government said the strong job growth figures might be
exaggerated because warm January weather that followed a bitter
cold December made it tough to seasonally adjust job totals for
construction and other industries affected by weather.
   The market first reacted negatively to the jobs data following
the bond market lower but quickly bounced back after digesting the
data.
   While special factors affected the jobs figures, analysts said
the data suggested the economy continued to slow in January as the
manufacturing sector slumped. But the economy's ability to absorb
the declines without a hike in the jobless rate was seen as an
encouraging sign that a recession was not imminent.
   Traders said renewed merger activity was helping revive takeover
stocks.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
up 1.25 to 182.77.

<TEXT>
   The West German finance chief on Friday
suggested circulating his country's currency in East Germany, and
the Soviet Union showed its greatest tolerance yet for unifying the
states.
   The idea of the prosperous West merging with the impoverished
East continued to shape the debate over how to rescue East Germany
from economic collapse and political paralysis.
   East Germans have brought their economy to a standstill with
strikes, protests and spiraling absenteeism as the country careens
toward its first free elections March 18.
   Dresden Mayor Wolfgang Berghofer, an influential and popular
reformer, said complete collapse is imminent unless workers are
given a convertible currency this year and the steady flood of
people leaving the country is stopped.
   ``My fear is that in the next few days and weeks an exodus of
hundreds of thousands will develop, and if this situation is not
quickly counteracted it will lead to political and economic
collapse,'' Berghofer said.
   Premier Hans Modrow also acknowledged this week the nation is
nearing collapse.
   Untold thousands are working illegally in West Berlin, earning
West German marks that have at least 10 times the buying power of
the meager Ostmarks they earn in their jobs in the East.
   West German officials have previously proposed plans for
eventual convertibility of the Ostmark, but Finance Minister Theo
Waigel suggested Friday that a more immediate and effective measure
might be wholesale introduction of the Deutschmark.
   He said it would give the population ``prospects for the future
that are immediately convincing.''
   A common currency is one of the steps toward unification of
Germany proposed by both Modrow and West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl.
   A Soviet government spokesman visiting East Berlin acknowledged
the situation in East Germany is extremely sensitive.
   Yuri Gremitskikh said strikes and demonstrations had cut deeply
into industrial performance.
   Gremitskikh also confirmed that the Kremlin has had to accept
reunification as an inevitable consequence of the democratic
revolutions sweeping Eastern Europe.
   He repeated the Soviet view that a reunified Germany should not
belong to either the NATO or Warsaw Pact alliances, but declined to
say whether the Soviet Union would veto reunification if West
German territory retained NATO forces.
   The Soviet Union, the United States, France and Britain retain
control of Berlin under their status as the four victorious powers
from World War II. They essentially would have to approve
unification to allow Berlin to be part of a single German state.
   In Moscow, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze proposed
Friday that Europeans, Americans and Canadians vote on
reunification because they suffered so much in World War II.
   The Soviet envoy gave the Kremlin's strongest endorsement yet to
reunification, but repeated conditions that this must not
destabilize Europe. German unity should be decided in a referendum
among Europeans, Canadians and Americans or ``through wide
parliamentary discussions,'' Shevardnadze said in the interview
carried by the official news agency Tass.
   Communist Party leader Gregor Gysi flew to Moscow on Friday for
talks with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on East Germany.
   Kohl and Modrow plan their second summit on Feb. 13-14 in Bonn,
but the two arranged to meet privately Saturday while in Davos,
Switzerland, for an international economics conference.
   West German government spokesman Dieter Vogel told reporters in
Bonn that the talks would focus on ways West Germany can aid East
Germans until the elections.
   Modrow on Thursday proposed a plan for reunifying Germany and
called for talks with West Germany to work out details.
   Kohl rejected the East German premier's condition that a united
Germany be militarily neutral, but said he would be willing to
enter negotiations after the vote.
   Uniting the Germanys has become likely since a pro-democracy
revolution ousted hard-line East German leader Erich Honecker on
Oct. 18, leading to the opening of the Berlin Wall and installation
of a reform-oriented coalition government.

<HEAD>Wheat Futures Rise On News Of China Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat futures prices rose moderately Friday on
the Chicago Board of Trade in response to news late in the session
that China was seeking to buy 300,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at
subsidized prices.
   Corn futures closed slightly lower while the oat and soybean
markets ended mixed.
   The China bid was not unexpected since the Chinese had 300,000
metric tons of wheat left to buy under an allocation extended by
the Agriculture Department last year.
   But a recent slowdown in export sales of wheat has contributed
to a price drop of more than 35 cents a bushel since mid-December,
so any sign of stronger demand is likely to rally the market,
analysts said.
   Katherina Zimmer, grains analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets Inc., said the bid's proposed delivery dates _ in April and
May _ were earlier than expected but she dismissed Friday's rally
as insignificant relative to the recent decline.
   ``It's nothing,'' she said.
   At the close of trading, wheat futures were 1 cent to 4\ cents
higher with the contract for delivery in March at $3.79{ a bushel;
corn futures were } cent to 2{ cents lower with March at $2.36} a
bushel; oats were { cent lower to { cent higher with March at

<HEAD>Toy Company Makes Deal With New Kids On The Block</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN SCHWARTZ</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   If a Michael Jackson doll can do well,
then can dolls modeled after the five-man rock group New Kids on
The Block do five times as well?
   Toymaker Hasbro Inc. should find out soon enough as it launches
a line under an agreement with the New Kids, ranked the hottest pop
group of 1989 by Billboard magazine.
   Wayne Charness, a Hasbro spokesman, confirmed Friday that a deal
had been reached between the toy company and the group, but said
details would be announced at a news conference Monday at New
York's Hard Rock Cafe.
   The new line will include dolls and items related to their
music, said Win Wilford, an executive vice president of Dick Scott
Entertainment, which manages the group.
   It's been years since a major toy company made a doll based on a
pop musician, said Paul Valentine, a toy industry analyst for
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.
   Valentine said that plans for a New Kids product sound ``like a
terrific idea to me.'' The Michael Jackson doll was launched by LJN
Toys Ltd. of New York five years ago and did ``exceptionally well
for a short period of time,'' he said.
   An LJN spokesman, who asked that his name not be used, said the
company sold ``at least a couple of hundred thousand'' Jackson
dolls.
   Although the doll was on the market for less than a year, ``It
was considered a very successful product,'' he said.
   ``These things do have a lifespan, but with proper marketing
within the lifespan it can be very lucrative,'' he said.
   Hasbro has a solid product line, including the G.I. Joe action
figure, Tinkertoys, the Donald Trump board game and Cabbage Patch
Kids. It even launched some dolls fashioned after the characters
from the movie ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit?''
   ``The rule of thumb in the industry was that toys based on
motion pictures or personalities tended to be short-lived. But the
rules have been broken so often that everyone is scrambling to find
out what works,'' Valentine said Thursday.
   An animated Saturday-morning cartoon series based on the New
Kids is being developed for network television, said Wilford.
   The New Kids, whose members range in age from 17 to 20, are
popular among adolescent girls and also their parents because of
their anti-drug message.
   ``The parents feel comfortable,'' he said, because of ``the
clean image.''
   The group was assembled in 1984 by Boston producer Maurice Starr
and started its first major tour last summer as an opening act for
former teen-queen Tiffany. By the end of the trip, Tiffany was
opening for the New Kids.
   Some have criticized the group because none of its members play
instruments _ but others have compared it to The Jackson 5 and the
Monkees.
   ``Everything is turning out wonderful about these kids,'' said
Wilford, ``the concerts are sold out, the records are selling in
millions ...''
   The Kids, who have sold about 11.5 million albums in three
releases, including the popular Hangin` Tough album, have a new one
due out in March, said Wilford.
   A European tour starts in April.

   Stock prices, after recovering from an early
slump, closed higher following a report on January employment that
helped ease worries that the economy may be moving into a recession.
   The Labor Department reported today that the nation's
unemployment rate held steady at 5.3 percent last month while
275,000 new non-farm payroll jobs were created.
   The number of new jobs was substantially higher than market
expectations of about 160,000 jobs, analysts said.
   But the government said the strong job growth figures might be
exaggerated because warm January weather that followed a bitter
cold December made it tough to seasonally adjust job totals for
construction and other industries affected by weather.
   Delays in the reporting of post-Christmas layoffs in retail
trade also may have skewed the numbers, the government said.
   The market first reacted negatively to the jobs data in response
to a slide in the bond market but quickly bounced back after
digesting the data.
   Analysts said the data, while suggesting the economy continued
to slow in January as the manufacturing sector slumped, also
indicated that the economy is not headed for a recession and may be
breaking out of its recent doldrums.
   Traders said renewed merger activity also helped revive takeover
stocks. In particular, drug and biotechnology stocks got a boost
from news that Roche Holdings would acquire a majority stake in
Genentech Corp.
   ``We're having a rally from an oversold condition,'' said
Charles Jensen, chief technical analyst for MKI Securities Corp.
``It's a long overdue rally.''
   Late in the day, the market retraced some of its gains as
investors remained cautious ahead of next week's $30 billion
Treasury refunding, which could provide a better clue about the
prospects for interest rates.

   Retailing executive Allen I. Questrom on
Friday was appointed chairman and chief executive officer of
Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp. to lead
them through bankruptcy court-supervised reorganizations.
   The appointment was announced on the day that newly formed
committees of unsecured creditors for Federated and Allied
conducted their first organizational meetings in Cincinnati,
headquarters of the two companies owned by Toronto-based Campeau
Corp.
   Federated and Allied filed Jan. 15 for protection from creditors
under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act, listing $7.7
billion in debts.
   Questrom, 49, a former Federated vice chairman who once headed
the company's Rich's and Bullock's department store divisions, has
been serving as president and chief executive officer of the
Dallas-based Nieman-Marcus department store group since September
1988.
   Questrom assumes his new position immediately, said G. William
Miller, chairman and chief executive officer of Federated Stores
Inc., the holding company for Federated and Allied.
   Under terms of a contract filed with the bankruptcy court,
Questrom would receive $1.2 million in salary for a term of five
years. The contract also would offer annual ``value-added'' bonuses
beginning at $2 million in 1990.
   Questrom was said to be in Dallas on Friday, but did not return
a telephone call. He is to arrive in Cincinnati next week, company
spokeswoman Carol Sanger said.
   He succeeds John W. Burden III, who resigned effective Wednesday.
   Questrom rejoins James M. Zimmerman, president and chief
operating officer of Federated and Allied. The two men worked
together when Questrom was chairman and Zimmerman was president of
Federated's Atlanta-based Rich's division from 1980 to 1984.
   Under their leadership, Rich's more than tripled its earnings to
become Federated's most profitable division by 1984, said Miller,
who took his job overseeing Federated and Allied on Jan. 16.
   ``This kind of dynamism is not an everyday occurrence,'' Miller
said. ``It makes the reassembly of this outstanding management team
at this point in Federated and Allied's history all the more
significant and important as we look toward optimizing the
performance of our department stores during this period. That is my
single highest objective, and it is one I know Allen shares.''

<HEAD>Bank of Boston Announces Overhaul, Retirement of Vice President</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Bank of New England, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bank of Boston Corp., the biggest bank in New
England, is streamlining its structure and operations as part of a
plan to expand in the region and upgrade its services worldwide,
Chairman Ira Stepanian announced Friday.
   The announcement was timed with another one: the retirement of
Clark W. Miller, hed of the bank's New England Banking Group and
chief architect of the bank's reorganization.
   The moves Miller orchestrated include consolidating the
corporation's five business groups into three.
   Miller had told the bank's management more than two years ago
that he planned to retire on turning 60, which occurred last week.
His departure after 27 years at the bank is effective March 31.
   The changes at Bank of Boston, the 15th-largest bank in the
country with assets of $39 billion at the close of 1989, come at a
time when the New England banking industry is suffering financial
troubles and shaking up executive offices. Four senior officials of
the Bank of New England were let go earlier this week.
   But Bank of Boston spokesman Wayne Taylor said Friday that a
reorganization at his institution was called for ever since the
bank started acquiring other New England banks in 1984.
   ``This is a logical strategy,'' Taylor said. ``It does not have
anything to do with problems in the New England economy or real
estate development. This was a long-term plan.''
   The sagging economy and real estate market have been blamed in
part for the banking industry's difficulties.
   Customers, whether commercial or retail, will see no change as a
result of the restructuring other than more uniformity and
availability of bank products and services, such as the opening of
more branches, Taylor said.
   Bank of Boston's major banking subsidiaries are First National
Bank of Boston, Casco Northern Bank, Bank of Boston Connecticut,
Rhode Island Hospital Trust National Bank and Bank of Vermont.
   The bank posted a small gain in the fourth quarter after selling
its credit card business to Chase Manhattan.
   Stepanian, in a prepared statement, described the corporate
overhaul as ``a realignment of our organizational structure
designed to achieve greater strategic focus, marketing synergy,
operational efficiency and internal coordination.
   ``This organizational realignment will, in turn, maximize the
earnings power and value of our enterprise to stockholders,'' said
Stepanian, who also is the company's chief operating officer.
   The restructuring will establish three banking groups: New
England Banking, National Banking and Global Banking. Within those
three will be the restructured operations of the Real Estate and
Treasury-Banking Services groups.
   Peter C. Read, most recently head of the Treasury-Banking
Services Group, will succeed Miller.
   The bank outlined the restructuring as follows:
   New England Banking Group _ Under a plan to achieve regional
integration begun by Miller and now to be overseen by Read, this
group will reorganize its management and operations to establish
them region-wide in four areas: retail banking, commercial banking,
personal trust and private banking, and external affairs and
marketing.
   National Banking Group _ This section will focus on relationship
banking and on serving U.S. businesses. It will now include the
commercial lending operation handled by the former Real Estate
Group. This group will also now contain the bank's Leasing
Division, which will be transferred from the former
Treasury-Banking Services Group. T. Lincoln Morison Jr., an
executive vice president, will continue to manage this group.
   Global Banking Group _ Kevin J. Mulvaney, an executive vice
president, will continue to run this group, formerly the
International Banking Group. Under the restructuring, the group
will broaden the scope of its operations to provide more banking
products and services to its customers worldwide. One aim is to
achieve more geographically balanced earnings through
customer-driven businesses.
   Edwin B. Morris was fired last fall as Bank of Boston's head of
real estate lending after the bank announced a $125 million
third-quarter loss, largely because of bad loans for real estate
development.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John J. Phelan Jr. led the New York Stock
Exchange into the computer age. His successor may have to take it
into further dimensions.
   When Phelan retires as chairman of the nation's largest exchange
at the end of the year, the NYSE will face issues experts believe
threaten to remold the way the stock market operates by the year
2000.
   Among its greatest challenges are a relentless growth in
technology, including computer-assisted trading techniques and
trading floor automation.
   The 198-year-old exchange also must compete in interlocked
global markets, an around-the-clock battle that threatens to siphon
away business and may force the NYSE to change its 9:30 a.m. to 4
p.m. trading day.
   ``We're potentially looking at a very different industry,'' Eric
K. Clemons, an associate professor at the University of
Pennsylvania's Wharton School, said Friday.
   ``The challenge to John's successor will be preserving all the
things the exchange does well while minimizing the disruption to
the various communities he serves,'' Clemons said.
   In his six years as Big Board chairman and chief executive, the
mild-mannered Phelan has balanced the concerns of floor brokers and
specialists, small investors, big institutions and companies whose
stocks are traded there.
   Phelan foresaw dynamic growth in trading volume, to 165 million
shares a day last year from 18.6 million when he became vice
chairman in 1975, and the potential for disaster that came with it.
And he skillfully persuaded floor professionals that installing
computers wouldn't destroy their business.
   In fact, Phelan cites modernizing the trading system as his
greatest achievement because it allowed the exchange to stay open
and handle 600 million shares during the Oct. 19, 1987, market
crash, when some fully automated markets closed down.
   ``With competition and telecommunications, the impact of
technology has not yet fully had its effect on the New York Stock
Exchange,'' said Hans Stoll, a finance professor at Vanderbilt
University's graduate management school in Nashville, Tenn.
   Experts believe a calming presence and diplomatic talent like
Phelan's is needed to prevent bad blood from developing over how
the Big Board responds to change.
   ``You do have a floor and the floor has a strong opinion and a
strong voice. But there are other constituencies,'' said John W.
Bachmann, a managing partner with Edward D. Jones &amp; Co., the St.
Louis-based retail brokerage. ``There's going to be a need to
balance the interest of each of those groups.''
   As the Tokyo Stock Exchange continues to draw attention as a
financial center and Europe looms as a greater power following the
Common Market's planned economic integration in 1992, many experts
say the NYSE could lose business overseas. Domestic markets
offering after-hours trading via computer also pose a threat.
   Under the existing system, more than 80 percent of trades are
routed to the NYSE floor electronically and the rest manually by
brokers working a battery of telephones. Specialists set trading
prices and execute the orders to ensure a fair and orderly market.
   Critics of the specialist system maintain that all trades one
day will be handled automatically and the stock exchange floor will
become a computer room that may eventually leave its lower
Manhattan home on Wall Street.
   Proponents say further adaptation to computerization is
inevitable, but human beings will remain essential to keeping the
U.S. markets stable.
   ``You need all the hardware and software possible but it's still
going to be a market determined by men and women,'' said Robert N.
Downey, a managing partner at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. and chairman of
the Securities Industry Association.
   While Phelan also has tried to balance pro- and anti-program
trading forces, his successor may be forced to regulate _ if the
government doesn't do it first _ what forms of computer-driven
trading are permitted.
   One possible reform is ``real-time'' reporting of program
trading activity to give market players an idea of how much program
trading, which has been accused of exaggerating volatility, is
taking place. For example, such activity might be reported every
five minutes.
   At a news conference Thursday announcing his retirement, Phelan
showed his even-handed style in discussing program trading. ``You
probably do more by cooperation than by fiat or somebody passing a
law or regulation about it,'' he said.
   He also said markets need to accommodate both small investors
and institutions. Securities Industry Association figures show that
institutions accounted for 76 percent of NYSE volume from
January-November 1989, but experts say the number of retail
transactions remains larger.
   ``There are people on both sides who want to exclude other
people from the marketplace,'' Phelan said. ``You cannot run a
marketplace to the exclusion of any one element.''

   Members of Congress criticized the insurance
industry Friday for socking the elderly with huge price increases
for ``medigap'' health policies and said tougher regulation may be
needed to curb price and marketing abuses.
   ``Millions of seniors spend billions of dollars each year on
medigap policies and many are being ripped off and cheated out of
their limited fixed incomes,'' Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., told a
Senate Finance subcommittee.
   ``This medigap mess has flourished because federal regulation is
a voluntary, unenforceable patchwork of legal mumbo-jumbo, more
loophole than law.''
   Private insurance companies sell medigap policies to the elderly
to bridge gaps in their coverage from Medicare. Premiums are rising
sharply this year; insurers say the increases are justified because
health-care costs are rising and because benefits must be provided
that previously were offered under Medicare's catastrophic-care
program.
   But several members of the Senate subcommittee on Medicare and
long-term care questioned whether this year's big rate increases
are warranted, even with rising costs and the repeal of the
catastrophic-care program.
   ``We simply cannot tolerate the sale of medigap insurance
policies that are over-priced or under-valued, especially at these
prices,'' said the subcommittee chairman, Sen. Jay Rockefeller,
D-W.Va.
   The legislators also complained that marketing abuses continue
in the medigap industry, with high-pressure salesmen selling
duplicative and unnecessary policies to frightened old people.
   ``We continue to find people with five to 10 medigap policies
that are over-priced, over-sold and seldom used,'' said Sen. David
Pryor, D-Ark.
   Janet Shikles of the General Accounting Office told the panel
that surveys found 1990 medigap rate increases averaging 20 percent
among 20 commercial insurers and averaging 29 percent for
individual policies sold by Blue Cross and Blue Shield. Rate
increases ranged from 5 percent to 52 percent.
   Shikles said many insurance companies fail to meet even minimum
targets, established by federal law and enforced by the states, on
what percentage of premium dollars collected should be paid out in
benefits.
   Many companies pay out benefits that equal less than 60 percent
of what they collect in premiums, she said. Among Blue Cross-Blue
Shield plans, however, 98 percent met or surpassed the loss-ratio
standards, she said.
   ``We are continuing to find that policies are being marketed to
the elderly that are not meeting the minimum standards, and these
are not difficult standards to meet,'' Shikles said. ``Many of the
rate increases seem very high.''
   However, Earl R. Pomeroy, president of the National Association
of Insurance Commissioners and insurance commissioner for North
Dakota, said state regulators have been closely monitoring rate
increases and believe most are ``supported by the costs of the
benefits that the insurance companies must restore ... and prior
claims experience.''
   Linda Jenckes, vice president of the Health Insurance
Association of America, said medigap already is the most highly
regulated form of insurance and that no added restrictions are
needed.
   She said recent price increases were justified by the rising
costs of health care, the added catastrophic benefits and other
factors. Jenckes said occasional abuses in the system are being
adequately addressed by state regulators.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   The dollar finished mostly higher Friday in
light, uneventful trading on world currency markets.
   Gold prices rose, with gains more pronounced in overseas
dealings. On New York's Commodity Exchange, a troy ounce of gold
gained 20 cents to close at $418.20. Republic National Bank later
quoted a bid of $418.50 a troy ounce, up 85 cents from late
Thursday.
   The dollar rose following the release of a better-than-expected
Labor Department report showing the nation's unemployment rate held
steady at 5.3 percent in January.
   The government said non-farm payrolls increased by 275,000, but
the manufacturing sector lost 112,000 jobs.
   ``It was a mixed bag,'' said Marc Chandler, an analyst at
Chicago-based MMS International. ``People who remain bearish on the
dollar cite the manufacturing number; people who are bullish look
at the payroll gains.''
   Traders reason that a steady unemployment rate will keep the
Federal Reserve from easing interest rates. High interest rates
make U.S. securities more attractive to foreigners, who need
dollars to make such investments.
   Most of the day's activity centered on the dollar and the West
German mark, both of which moved in a wide range. When the dollar
reached a high against the mark at around midday in New York, ``the
market took profits in the dollar and immediately bought marks
again,'' said Stephen Flanagan, a vice president at Manufacturers
Hanover Trust Co.
   ``Every time the dollar goes up (against the mark), people jump
right in and buy marks,'' he said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 144.95 Japanese yen, up 0.45 yen
from Thursday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at
145.35 yen. In New York the dollar closed at 145.50 yen, up
marginally from 144.98 yen on Thursday.
   In London, the British pound was unchanged at $1.6820. The pound
also was unchanged in New York, where it finished at $1.6840.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday, included: 1.6830 West German marks, up from 1.6765;
1.4920 Swiss francs, unchanged; 5.7160 French francs, up from
5.6940; 1,251.00 Italian lire, up from 1,245.75, and 1.1885
Canadian dollars, up from 1.1866.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday,
included: 1.6860 West German marks, up from 1.6805; 1.4964 Swiss
francs, down from 1.4975; 5.7360 French francs, up from 5.7085;
1.9010 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8920; 1,252.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,248.00, and 1.1884 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1860.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $417.25 a troy ounce
from $415.25 late Thursday. In Zurich, Switzerland, the metal rose
to a closing bid of $417.75 from $415.60 bid late Thursday. Gold in
Hong Kong rose $2.96 to close at $415.38.
   Silver prices also gained. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery closed at $5.307 a troy ounce, up from $5.297
on Thursday. In London the metal traded at a late bid price of
$5.29 a troy ounce, up from Thursday's $5.26.

<HEAD>Strong Gasoline Demand Foreseen, Boosting Futures Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Expectations of strong gasoline demand early this summer fueled
a strong rally in oil futures prices Friday on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   On other commodity markets, copper and precious metal futures
rose; livestock and meat futures were mixed; and grains and
soybeans were mixed.
   Gasoline futures posted the sharpest gains, settling .83 cent to
1.9 cents higher with the contract for delivery in March at 64.22
cents a gallon; West Texas Intermediate crude oil finished .32 cent
to .44 cent higher with March at 23.02 cents gallon; heating oil
was .77 cent to 1.52 cents higher with March at 58.26 cents a
gallon.
   Friday's strong rally after modest gains on Thursday suggests
the petroleum markets are beginning a new upward push, analysts
said.
   Another sign of a developing bull move was the market's ho-hum
reaction to Tuesday's weekly American Petroleum Institute inventory
report, which showed larger-than-expected supplies of crude oil and
refined products, especially gasoline.
   ``Sights are getting set further out,'' said Randolph Donney, a
research analyst with Elders Futures Inc. in New York. ``People are
not really focusing on near-term fundamentals that much.''
   Indeed, the strongest gains Friday were in contracts for April
and May delivery, indicating that petroleum dealers are locking in
supplies for the late spring and early summer, when the vacation
season begins and gasoline consumption swells.
   Strong gasoline demand tends to boost U.S. crude futures prices
because West Texas Intermediate crude _ the type traded in New York
_ is more easily refined into high-quality gasoline than some other
varieties, Donney noted.
   Copper futures rose sharply on New York's Commodity Exchange
amid signs of tightening supplies.
   The Comex reported a decline of 561 tons in its warehouse stocks
of copper from Thursday to Friday, bringing the level down to
6,621, the lowest this year.
   Warehouse stocks reported weekly by the London Metal Exchange
have also been falling recently, and Monday's report is expected to
show a further decline of 2,000 to 5,000 tons, analysts said.
   Demand for copper apparently is picking up after slackening in
December.
   Some buying also may have stemmed from brighter economic
perceptions due to the stock market's recent gains and Friday's
U.S. unemployment report, which showed no change in the jobless
rate.
   Copper is heavily used in the construction industry, making the
market extremely sensitive to economic news.
   Copper finished 1.9 cents to 2.35 cents higher with February at
$1.015 a pound.
   Gold futures settled 10 cents to 20 cents higher on the Comex
with February at $418.20 a troy ounce; silver was 1 cent higher
across the board with March at $5.338 a troy ounce.
   Cattle futures advanced and pork futures retreated on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange ahead of the Agriculture Department's
semi-annual cattle inventory report.
   The report, released after the close of trading, showed a cattle
herd of 99.3 million head, unchanged from a year ago. The number
was slightly below expections but was not expected to have a
significant impact on futures prices.
   Live cattle settled .15 cent to .57 cent higher with February at
79.57 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .43 cent
higher with March at 83.05 cents a pound; live hogs were .35 cent
lower to .12 cent higher with February at 48.42 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .32 cent to 1.2 cents lower with February
at 49 cents a pound.
   Wheat futures prices rose moderately on the Chicago Board of
Trade in response to news late in the session that China was
seeking to buy 300,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized
prices.
   Wheat futures settled 1\ cents to 3} cents higher with March at
$3.79 a bushel; corn futures were } cent to 2\ cents lower with
March at $2.36} a bushel; oats were unchanged to { cent higher with
March at $1.36 a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent lower to { cent
higher with March at $5.60\ a bushel.

<HEAD>McGraw-Hill Abruptly Closes Its Electronic Business News Service</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McGraw-Hill Inc. pulled the plug Friday on its
electronic business news services, saying the market for them was
developing more slowly than expected.
   ``In view of the current business climate and the uncertain
economic outlook, McGraw-Hill is going to focus its resources on
opportunities with an earlier payoff,'' the company said in a
statement.
   The unexpected decision to close its McGraw-Hill News and
Standard &amp; Poor's News services at the close of business Friday
came only a day after the company reported a fourth-quarter loss of
$98.3 million, due mainly to the impact of a corporate
restructuring.
   The company had disclosed in December that it planned to charge
$152 million after taxes against its fourth-quarter earnings to
reflect a realignment of operations, asset writedowns, the closing
of its general book division and creation of a reserve for
severance payments associated with the elimination of more than
1,000 jobs.
   The services were designed to provide an assortment of business,
economic an financial news throughout the day in competition with
similar services from Dow Jones &amp; Co., Reuters Holdings PLC and
others.
   The securities industry has been slumping in recent months,
however, as retail investment activity failed to rebound in the
wake of the October 1987 market crash.
   The announcement of the shutdown came after the close of the
stock market. In trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
McGraw-Hill closed at $55.50 a share, down 87{ cents.
   The two McGraw-Hill news services employed about 75 people,
including nine stationed at foreign offices in Tokyo, London,
Frankfurt and Paris. Its domestic offices were in New York,
Washgington, D.C., Detroit, Chicago and San Francisco.
   The company said it would ``make every effort'' to place the
staff in other psoitions within McGraw-Hill, which publishes
Business Week magazine, has interests in broadcasting and offers a
variety of information services for a range of businesses.
   The company declined to say how much revenue was generated by
the two services or how much it had invested in getting them in
operation.
   ``The editors did a fine job of creating an on-line business
news service but the market for the product is developing more
slowly than anticipated,'' the company said.
   The McGraw-Hill News service was introduced in September 1987,
and was made available directly to corporations and indirectly to
other customers through eight database distributors.
   Standard &amp; Poor's News was announced only last December and was
designed for the retail stock brokerage business. The company said
in December that it had signed the brokerage Edward D. Jones of St.
Louis with 1,450 offices.
   Company spokeswoman Betsy Russo said the staff of the two news
services was notified by management Friday of the plans to close
the systems at the end of the business day.
   She said the company expected no additional writedown would be
needed as a result of the shutdown because the fourth-quarter
charges provided for additional streamlining that had been
undetermined at that point.

   Energy futures rallied Friday, driven by
technically motivated buying, with crude oil closing above $23 a
barrel.
   Wholesale home heating oil prices regained all the ground lost
in Thursday's session while unleaded gasoline also settled
significantly higher.
   The contract for March delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude, rose 32 cents to $23.02 per
42-gallon barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, building on
Thursday's increase of 2 cents.
   Contracts calling for crude delivery during April, May and June
posted increases of 44 cents, 44 cents and 43 cents, respectively.
   The March contract for No. 2 heating oil, which lost 0.82 cent
on Thursday, jumped 1.52 cents to 58.26 cents a gallon. The April
through June contracts also ended with gains.
   Among other refined petroleum products traded on the New York
Merc, March unleaded gasoline surged 1.52 cents to settle at 64.22
cents a gallon after adding 0.9 cent on Thursday. Later-delivery
contracts rose by even bigger amounts.
   Greg Dreis, a Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. energy specialist, said the
rally mainly reflected internal market dynamics, not fundamental
developments affecting the supply and demand for the commodities.
   ``Basically, technical buying was what it was,'' he said.
``There's nothing really major about it.''

   President Bush, citing ``credible confidential
information,'' on Friday ordered a Chinese-owned corporation to
sell its interests in a Seattle aircraft parts company.
   Bush ordered the divestiture, on national security grounds, of
the Mamco Manufacturing Co. of Seattle by the China National
Aero-Technology Import and Export Corp.
   In ordering the action, Bush invoked for the first time a
provision of a 1988 trade law that gives the president the power to
restrict foreign investment in the United States if the nation's
security is affected.
   The president ordered the Chinese government to sell the company
because ``continued control of Mamco might threaten to impair the
national security,'' a White House statement said. The statement
cited ``credible confidential information'' for negating China's
1988 purchase of the Seattle company.
   Mamco manufactures metal parts for aircraft. Bush's action
upheld the recommendation of an inter-agency review panel that the
deal be voided.
   The panel found that the company, which reported $20 million in
sales in 1988, was involved with sensitive materials that could
have military applications, said officials who spoke on the
condition of anonymity.
   The president's order requires China to divest itself of Mamco
by May 1, uness an extension of up to three months is granted.
   Bush took the action even though his administration had been
moving towards re-establishing contacts with the Beijing government
in the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square crackdown last June.
   Sanctions Bush himself imposed on China in the aftermath of that
crackdown bar all military sales to China.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that Bush's action
``is in response to the circumstances of this particular
transaction. It does not change our policy, and it is not a
precedent for the future with regard to direct investment in the
United States from the People's Republic of China or any other
country.''
   A White House statement said, ``The president's action is based
on his finding that there is credible evidence that leads him to
believe that the acquistion could threaten the national security of
the United States.''
   The Chinese corporation is part of the Chinese Ministry of
Aereospace Industry. It has business dealings with various U.S.
companies ``in several sectors, including commercial aircraft,''
the statement said.
   Under terms of the trade act, Bush had 15 days to review the
recommendation of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United
States. The time would have expired at midnight.
   Bush was given the authority under the law to order the Chinese
corporation to cease its U.S. operations and sell its stock in the
Seattle company.
   His decision came a week after Bush narrowly won a congressional
vote sustaining his veto of a bill to extend visas of Chinese
students in the United States who do not want to return home for
fear of persecution.
   Bush veoted that bill, calling it an infringement on his
presidential prerogatives and claiming it was unnecesssary because
he had issued an executive order accomplishing the same protection
for Chinese students.

   The acting chairman of Bank of New England, which
is trying to rebound from the $1 billion loss projected for 1989,
said Friday the bank probably wouldn't turn a profit this year but
should come out ahead in the long run.
   ``We're in a fix-it mode. We're not going to be as big, but
we're going to be better,'' said interim Chairman H. Ridgely
Bullock, who was named by the board of directors last week.
   Bullock also told a news conference that the bank continues
experiencing deposit outflows sparked by the recent disclosure of
the extent of its financial problems, and would have to keep
borrowing from the federal government to meet the demands of
depositors.
   Bullock replaced Walter J. Connolly Jr., who was asked to leave
in the wake of serious financial problems at the company, which
with $29 billion in assets ranks as the nation's 18th largest
banking concern.
   Bank of New England reported its projected $1 billion annual
loss on Jan. 20. Fourth-quarter losses were estimated at $1.2
billion, among the biggest quarterly losses ever reported by a bank
of its size.
   The company has attributed much of the bank's problem to bad
real estate loans issued in the Northeast, which now total more
than $2.5 billion. The bank's capital has plunged below $500
million, or less than 2 percent of the institution's total assets.
   Bullock said the bank was hit hard by the declines in the real
estate market partly because lenders were not cautious enough with
developers.
   ``I think we had drifted away from the real basics of lending,''
Bullock said. ``It's a very tough business and it has to be managed
very toughly.''
   One of the first tasks for the bank's new management would be to
address the hundreds of depositors who have been withdrawing their
funds from the bank since it publicly acknowledged the depths of
its problems.
   Bullock declined to specify how many depositors were leaving the
bank. Several municipalities, including the city of Boston and
several cities and towns in Massachusetts and Connecticut have
withdrawn millions of dollars from the ailing institution,
officials said.
   Bullock also said the bank expected the outflow to continue, but
assured that the bank was safe for depositors.
   He confirmed recent reports that the Federal Reserve had lent
Bank of New England over $400 million in the week ended Wednesday,
a week after it reportedly borrowed up to $475 million.
   Bullock said the bank expected to continue seeking loans from
the Federal Reserve ``for some time'' as it sought to meet the
demands of depositors withdrawing their funds from the bank.
   Bullock said the bank was taking several steps to regain its
balance, including the sale of more than $450 million worth of
leasing assets and its credit card operations for $820 million. The
moves were two in a series of sales planned to net the bank $6
billion, he said.
   Bullock said he did not expect the bank to make money during the
rest of 1990 because of the costs associated with restructuring,
management shakeups and the quick pace of selling assets.
   Bank officials also were looking into the possibility of selling
subsidiaries, including Connecticut Bank and Trust and banks in
Maine and Rhode Island. No bids had been received yet, Bullock said.
   ``We want to make sure if we cut a deal that it is one we are
pleased with when we close it six months later,'' Bullock said.
``This is not any fire sale.''
   Part of what would put the bank on track would be changing its
corporate culture, Bullock said. Such changes would include getting
rid of personal perks that have often accompanied banking jobs in
the past, he said.
   Major changes also have been made in upper-level management,
where five top executives, including Connolly, have left since Jan.

   The stock market rallied Friday after a
government report on January employment boosted investor confidence
about the economy and eased fears about a possible recession.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials ended 16.44 points
higher at 2,602.70.
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,004 issues up, 495 down and 473 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 164.40 million
shares, up from 154.58 million in the previous session.
   The Labor Department reported that the nation's unemployment
rate held steady at 5.3 percent last month while 275,000 new
non-farm payroll jobs were created. The number of new jobs was
substantially higher than market expectations of about 160,000
jobs, analysts said.
   ``Stock investors took the attitude that employment is better
than expected which means business is better than expected and the
economy is not in a recession,'' said Jack Solomon, equities
analyst for Bear Stearns &amp; Co. ``That coming on top of a negative
psychological environment it was easy for the market to spring up.''
   The market had declined sharply last month, as the Dow
industrials lost more than 219 points.
   But the government said the strong job growth figures might be
exaggerated because warm January weather that followed a bitter
cold December made it tough to seasonally adjust job totals for
construction and other industries affected by weather. Delays in
the reporting of post-Christmas layoffs in retail trade also may
have skewed the numbers, the government said.
   The employment report also showed a continuing slump in the
manufacturing sector as factory jobs fell by 112,000 last month,
with 90,000 of the losses suffered by the struggling auto industry.
It was the 10th straight month manufacturing jobs declined.
   Nonetheless, analysts said the data, while suggesting the
economy continued to slow, also indicated that the economy may be
breaking out of its recent doldrums.
   ``The unexpectedly large increase in new jobs helped today's
rally in equities,'' said Charles Jensen, chief technical analyst
for MKI Securities Corp. ``It eased expectations that we are moving
into a recession and was encouraging for the economy.''
   The market first reacted negatively to the jobs data in response
to a slide in the bond market but quickly bounced back after
digesting the data.
   Traders said renewed merger activity also helped revive takeover
stocks. In particular, drug and biotechnology stocks got a boost
from news that Roche Holdings would acquire a majority stake in
Genentech Corp.
   Despite the rally, the market retraced some of its gains late in
the day as investors remained cautious ahead of next week's $30
billion Treasury refunding, which could provide a better clue about
the prospects for interest rates.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 195.42 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $23.358 billion, or
0.74 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.23 to 182.75.
   Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, Genentech, the most
active stock, rose 8&lsqb; to 29~ on news that Roche Holding's would
acquire a majority stake in the company. Philip Morris rose \ to
38\, USX added &rsqb; to 34\ and AT&amp;T advanced 1 to 39&rsqb;.
   Chrysler, meanwhile, ended down &lsqb; at 16, Harcourt Brace declined
&lsqb; to 2, Bristol Myers dropped { to 52~, while IBM ended up | at 98&rsqb;
and General Motors ended unchanged at 41~.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 2.80 to 381.13, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index advanced 2.13 to 330.92.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market ended
with a 4.45 gain at 422.21. At the American Stock Exchange, the
market value index closed at 353.56, up 2.06.

<HEAD>Engelhard Restructuring Away From Its Well-Known Metals Business</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The restructuring of Engelhard Corp., the
metals and chemical company once headed by the supposed model for
James Bond nemesis Goldfinger, could mean higher profits and a
clearer corporate identity, analysts said Friday.
   Engelhard, a leading metals refiner and maker of gold and silver
products, says it is selling those businesses to concentrate on
chemical production and its promise of higher profit margins.
   The Iselin-based concern also has announced a restructuring that
will shed 500 salaried jobs from its 8,100-member workforce and
shut a number of plants worldwide.
   Engelhard stock fell $1.12{ a share to $20.37{ on the New York
Stock Exchange Friday.
   The restructuring announced Thursday prompted Engelhard to take
a $160 million charge on 1989 earnings, giving it a $77.5 million
loss for the year. Fourth quarter losses were $145.9 million
compared with a $19.3 million profit a year earlier.
   Revenue for the year rose $52 million, to $2.4 billion.
Engelhard spokesman Francis X. Vitale Jr. said the restructuring
and sale of businesses should pare away 35 percent of its revenue.
   Thomas Van Leeuwen, an analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
in New York, said the restructuring was overdue and that the
company's performance had stagnated in the past five years.
   Engelhard's performance has been hurt by a diversion of
management attention to its electronics business and by competition
from other major makers of catalysts, such as W.R. Grace and Union
Carbide, Van Leeuwen said. Catalysts are used in petroleum refining
and chemical manufacturing.
   Cyclical changes in refining also have hurt. With increased
amounts of lighter grade crude oil coming on the market, smaller
amounts of catalysts are needed to break the oil down into
petroleum products such as gasoline, said analyst Jeff Cianci of
Bear Stearns &amp; Co. in New York.
   Shedding the metals business could help focus attention on the
operations that actually constitute Engelhard's main business,
possibly giving investors a better idea of the company's prospects.
   ``Investors have mistaken the true identity of this company in
the past,'' said Van Leeuwen. Many do not realize it does not
produce gold and silver but only makes products from them, and also
that it has substantial chemical operations, he said.
   Engelhard does have the nation's largest gold and silver product
manufacturing plant, located in Plainville, Mass.
   The company was founded in Newark in 1902 by Charles W.
Engelhard Sr. after he bought the Charles Croselmire Co. and began
acquiring specialty metals firms. His son, Charles W. Engelhard
Jr., greatly expanded its operations.
   The wealthy Engelhard Jr., known as the ``platinum king,'' also
was a friend of James Bond creator Ian Fleming, and supposedly
served as an inspiration for the character of the villain
Goldfinger.
   Engelhard was a portly figure who often carried an ebony cane,
and would joke with friends about his identification with the spy
story villain, according to a 1971 obituary.
   Goldfinger might not recognize Engelhard Corp. based on its
remaining businesses.
   For sale are its gold and silver refining and fabrication
businesses; metal joining operations; electronic chemicals section,
which provides precious metals to electronic circuitry makers;
crystals business, which supplies makers of radiation detectors;
and part of its jewelry products business.
   Businesses it will keep include its platinum group, which makes
components of catalytic convertors for cars; its profitable
precious metal trading operation; its chemical and petroleum
catalysts group; and its additives and pigment business.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices tumbled Friday after a new
government report on employment in January suggested the economy is
stronger than expected, diminishing chances for lower interest
rates.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond lost } point, or $7.50 for
every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which rises when the price
declines, jumped to 8.50 percent from 8.43 percent late Thursday.
   Analysts said bond prices fell after the Labor Department
reported that the U.S. unemployment rate held steady at 5.3 percent
in January as the economy began the new year by producing 275,000
new jobs.
   The job growth figure was about 100,000 more than expected,
according to Sung Won Sohn, chief economist for Norwest Corp. in
Minneapolis.
   He noted the government also reported that orders for
manufactured goods gained 1.9 percent in December, and said that
also was above most analysts' expectations.
   ``The economy is stronger than the market feels comforable with.
That diminishes chances that interest rates would decline and
raised some inflation concerns,'' he said.
   A strong economy tends to hurt bond prices because interest
rates normally rise in such periods, eroding the value of bonds in
circulation.
   Sohn said bonds finished above their lows of the day, however,
because the dolar rose against the Japanese yen, making returns on
dollar-denominated investments more attractive to the Japanese.
   The Japanese are usually relied on to buy a healthy amount of
new Treasury securities, and strength in the dollar could help keep
them interested next week as the government auctions $30 billion in
new securities.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
government issues declined &lsqb; point to 7-32 point, intermediate
maturities fell by between 5-16 point and 9-16 point and long-term
issues dropped as much as 13-16 point, according to figures
provided by Telerate Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, fell 3.85 to 1,159.26.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds slipped 1-16 point to 91 6-16. The average
yield to maturity rose to 7.46 percent from 7.45 percent late
Thursday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 8.05 percent as the
discount gained 4 basis points to 7.79 percent. Yields on six-month
bills advanced to 8.15 percent as the discount gained 4 basis
points at 7.74 percent. Yields on one-year bills jumped to 8.11
percent as the discount rose 3 basis points to 7.57 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each
other on overnight loans, was quoted at 8\ percent, unchanged from
late Thursday.

<HEAD>Work at Overburdened Douglas Aircraft May Be Moved to St. Louis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McDonnell Douglas Corp., facing the end of
two military aircraft contracts by 1993, may shift some work on its
new jumbo jet from its overburdened Long Beach plant to St. Louis,
a spokesman said.
   The strategy, which officials said could avoid up to 12,000
layoffs in St. Louis, is under discussion but no timetable has been
set, Don Hanson, a spokesman for the company's Long Beach-based
Douglas Aircraft unit, said Thursday.
   Hanson said a shift would not lead to any layoffs at Douglas
Aircraft, which is struggling with so many commercial aircraft
orders that it is behind schedule on all its programs.
   Manufacturing components for the new MD-11 jumbo jet or other
planes at McDonnell Aircraft Co. in St. Louis ``is a possibility,''
Hanson said.
   ``They already build the nose section for the C-17,'' the big
cargo plane that Douglas assembles in Long Beach, he said.
   Until now, McDonnell Aircraft has manufactured planes solely for
the military.
   William S. Ross, president of McDonnell Aircraft, said moving
some of the MD-11 work to his division could help save about 12,000
jobs in St. Louis. More work on Douglas' C-17 military cargo plane
also will be shifted to St. Louis, Ross said, but he declined to
discuss the timing.
   St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas is the nation's top defense
contractor.
   By contrast with St. Louis, Long Beach is ``very much full to
capacity,'' Hanson said. ``We have been looking for some time to
find ways to put some of the work out to other sources.''
   Douglas Aircraft, after increasing its payroll by about 20
percent in each of the past four years, has grown nearly as large
as it can, Hanson said, although a few more employees will be added
this year.
   Douglas now employs about 45,000 workers, including 35,000 in
Long Beach and another 5,000 in nearby Torrance.
   McDonnell had previously announced plans to shift its T-45A
Goshawk trainer program, plagued by technical problems and delays,
to St. Louis from California.
   About 1,800 workers in St. Louis are to be reassigned to the
Goshawk program. McDonnell makes the F-15E Eagle fighter for the
Air Force, the AV-8B Harrier II short-takeoff-vertical landing jet
for the Marines and the F-A-18 Hornet for the Navy in St. Louis.
   Pentagon budget proposals announced this week call for phasing
out Eagle and Harrier orders after Sept. 30, 1991, although
backlogs could keep the two planes in production until 1993.
   The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers, the largest union representing McDonnell Aircraft workers,
has been pushing McDonnell Douglas to shift more commercial
aircraft work to St. Louis.
   McDonnell Aircraft has avoided a major layoff of aircraft
workers since phasing out in 1979 its production of the F-4
Phantom, the Eagle fighter's predecessor.

<TEXT>
   Despite a strong government drive to
increase exports, South Korea recorded a trade deficit of $662
million in January, the worst since January 1985, officials said
Friday.
   Trade and Industry Ministry officials said South Korea's economy
has been sluggish this year, with its exports in January falling 10
percent from a year ago to $3.952 billion.
   Imports in the same month totaled $4.614 billion, up 5.2 percent
from last January, they said.
   South Korea's total exports in 1989 amounted to $62.3 billion,
up 2.6 percent from 1988, but officials said the growth rate was
the lowest among other Asian competitors such as Taiwan, Hong Kong,
Singapore and Japan.
   Ministry officials said the government would continue its
export-drive policy this year along with anti-inflation and other
measures to control steep wage and price hikes.
   In January, consumer prices rose by a sharp 1 percent from the
previous month and wholesale prices rose by 0.5 percent, compared
with a 1.1 percent increase in all of 1989.

<HEAD>MGM-UA Can Continue Lawsuit Against Disney, Appeals Court Rules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An appellate court has ruled MGM-UA
Communications Co. may sue Walt Disney Co. for breach of contract
because Disney built a working studio as part of a Florida theme
park that uses the MGM name.
   The ruling by the state's 2nd District Court of Appeals earlier
this week reverses a decision by the Superior Court, attorney Skip
Miller, representing MGM-UA, said Thursday.
   ``There are triable issues of fact regarding Disney's intent to
deceive,'' the appellate court stated.
   The action, originally filed in the lower court May 17, 1988,
concerns the Disney-MGM Studios theme park near Disney World in
Lake Buena Vista, Fla.
   In June 1985, the entertainment giants agreed that Disney would
build the studio tour located on 135 acres. The park includes a
1950s sitcom set, movie-TV sound studios with backstage tours and
other special effects adventures.
   The park opened in April 1989 and offered tourists a
behind-the-scenes glimpse of Hollywood. Movie and TV production
began in summer 1988 with the ``Superboy'' syndicated TV series and
parts of several large-screen films, while construction continued
on the tourist attraction portion.
   MGM-UA contends that Disney broke its license agreement by using
the MGM name ``on a full-scale, operating motion picture production
facility, rather than in connection with a public amusement park
built around the theme of motion pictures.''
   Disney argued it could not run a studio tour without a
production studio.
   But the appellate court ruled that ``neither logic, experience
or evidence compel the conclusion a studio tour must be built
around an actual, working studio.''
   Burbank-based Disney said in a statement it would fight the
complaint.
   ``The prior judgment was upheld on all issues but one, which is
essentially whether we have the right to use the MGM name on our
working Florida studio,'' the statement read.
   ``While we would have preferred, of course, to have the judgment
upheld on all counts, we are prepared to go to trial on the
remaining issue,'' it concluded.
   Miller said the ruling cuts deeper.
   ``It terminates the license agreement and allows us to recover
the MGM name so that Disney is precluded from using it in Florida
or anywhere else in the world,'' Miller said.
   Miller added that Disney has used the name for at least two
years and owes MGM-UA compensation for use of the MGM name.
   He said MGM-UA is seeking ``substantial'' compensatory and
punitive damages, but he did not specify an amount.
   A trial date for the case is expected to be set within six to
nine months, Miller said.

   Texas billionaire Harold C. Simmons said
Friday he may seek control of Lockheed Corp.'s board of directors
after the defense contractor rebuffed his request for
representation.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, an
investment group headed by Simmons-controlled NL Industries Inc.
disclosed it had raised its stake in Lockheed to 18.9 percent.
   Ron Meder, a spokesman for Calabasas, Calif.-based Lockheed,
said the defense contractor had not yet seen a copy of NL's filing
and could not comment until it had.
   In the SEC filing, the investment group said Simmons met with
Lockheed Chairman Daniel M. Tellep on Wednesday.
   ``Mr. Simmons requested that NL be allowed to obtain significant
minority representation'' on Lockheed's board and that Lockheed's
preferred share purchase rights takeover defense be redeemed,
according to the document filed in Washington.
   Tellep rejected both requests, the document stated, adding,
``Mr. Simmons said he would have to consider a range of options
including seeking board representation. Mr. Tellep said he had no
concerns about a proxy contest.''
   A proxy contest is an attempt by a person or group to take over
a company or jettison its management by obtaining enough proxies _
the legal authority to exercise a shareholder's vote _ to influence
a corporate election.
   In light of the response, the filing said Simmons and NL
``intend to consider their options including, but not limited to,
securing representation on, or control of, the company's board.''
   Lockheed later issued a statement quoting Tellep as confirming
the meeting with Simmons and adding that the investor had offered
no plans or proposals for the company beyond his requests.
   ``In our meeting, Mr. Simmons provided no basis whatsoever for
us to determine his intentions with respect to the company or
whether his interests would be consistent with those of Lockheed
and its other shareholders,'' Tellep stated.
   According to the filing, the Simmons-led group, already
Lockheed's largest stockholder, bought 629,000 shares between Jan.
16 and Jan. 23 at prices ranging from $39.38 and $39.75 per share.
   In recent months he steadily has increased his holdings in
Lockheed, developer of the stealth jet fighter plane, from 6.25
percent to 16.9 percent in December.
   After Simmons' initial purchase of Lockheed stock was revealed
in April, Lockheed created an employee stock ownership plan holding
about 17 percent of the company's outstanding shares in an attempt
to make a takeover more difficult.
   The meeting with Tellep is at least the second between the two
executives. In a previous filing with the SEC, Simmons said he met
with Tellep on May 15. In addition, he wrote the Lockheed executive
saying, ``We view Lockheed as a well-managed company. We have no
plans, or desire, to disrupt management. We expect to be a
constructive, long-term shareholder.''
   Earlier this week, Simmons, who has holdings in the chemical,
timber and sugar industries, announced plans for a $1.1 billion
tender offer for Georgia Gulf Corp.
   The Dallas billionaire was not available when phoned on Friday.
   In an interview last September, however, he said, ``The
fundamentals of Lockheed are not good; they're deteriorating. I
think defense budgets are going to be cut in real terms fairly
consistently for several years.''
   Simmons' latest move came as his NL Industries reported sharply
lower fourth-quarter earnings, partly because of the interest on
loans used to buy stock. Earnings in the three months ended Dec. 31
totaled $20.4 million, or 31 cents a share, vs. $47.1 million or 71
cents a share in the same 1988 period. Sales increased from $235.4
million to $239.4 million.
   For the year, NL's earnings totaled $172.9 million or $2.62 per
share on sales of $1 billion, vs. $162.9 million or $2.45 a share,
on $1.01 billion in sales.

<HEAD>Once Ailing Big Thrift Posts Healthy Earnings</HEAD>

   American Savings Bank, once the nation's
largest thrift before it faltered and was sold to Texas billionaire
Robert Bass in a government-assisted deal, on Friday reported hefty
earnings of $214.2 million for fiscal 1989.
   Assets, which were $15.4 billion when a group led by Bass bought
American in December 1988, rose by a modest 6 percent to $16.3
billion at the close of December 1989. Return on assets was a
strong 1.35 percent, meaning American earned $1.35 for every $100
in assets.
   American, whose problems began with bad real estate loans, said
loan originations totaled $2.9 billion during 1989, mainly in
residential mortgages. Of that amount, $2.6 billion were
adjustable-rate loans, providing American some protection from any
sharp increase in interest rates.
   ``Today American Savings is a stable, profitable financial
institution that meets all of the new, more stringent capital
requirements without benefit of regulatory forebearances,''
American Chairman Mario J. Antoci said in a statement Friday.
   The tougher standards for capital _ the cash cushion against
risk _ were imposed as part of last year's legislation bailing out
the insurance fund for the thrift industry.
   American was part of Financial Corp. of America when it ran into
huge losses on real estate and a run on deposits in the mid-1980s
under Charles W. Knapp, who was later replaced by regulators.
   A group led by Bass acquired the ailing thrift from regulators
in December 1988 in a $1.7 billion deal that split the troubled
assets off into a separate operation, which is selling them off.
The Bass group owns 70 percent of what remained of the thrift, the
government 30 percent.

<HEAD>Spanish-Language TV Company Works on Financial Restucturing</HEAD>

   Univision Holdings Inc., which operates one of
the largest Spanish-language television networks in the United
States, is trying to work out a financial restructuring after
missing $10 million in interest payments.
   The privately held company said Thursday that it had missed
interest payments due that day of about $3 million to its bank
lenders and $7 million to holders of its subordinated debentures.
   It blamed an ``insufficient cash flow'' and said efforts were
underway to work out a financial restructuring.
   Univision has about $315 million in bank debt, $135 million in
senior subordinated zero coupon debt and $105 million in 13&rsqb;
percent subordinated debentures outstanding.
   Univision Holdings is 63.5-percent owned by Hallmark Cards Inc.,
a privately held company based in Kansas City, Mo., and
21.5-percent owned by an affiliate of First Chicago Corp. The
remainder is owned by Televisa SA, a media company based in Mexico.
   The company was created in two steps with Hallmark's acquisition
in 1987 of Spanish International Communications Corp., which owned
five Spanish-language TV stations, and its 1988 buyout of Univision
Inc., which operated a Spanish-language TV network.
   Univision Holdings currently operates the network with 18
affiliate stations and owns eight TV stations. The network and
stations reach about 92 percent of the Hispanic households in the
United States.
   ``The basic business is not in trouble,'' said spokeswoman Mary
Conway, ``but it cannot satisfy the cash requirement of the present
financial structure. The current business environment is much more
competitive than when this financial structure was created.''

   Federal regulators on Friday sold the
insolvent Bright Banc Savings Association of Dallas to an Ohio bank
holding company in the largest thrift sale since enactment of the
S&amp;L bailout law in August.
   Banc One Corp. of Columbus, Ohio, is receiving $1.1 billion in
government assistance to acquire Bright Banc, founded in the early
1980s by H.R. ``Bum'' Bright, once one of the 50 wealthiest men in
the country and the former owner of the Dallas Cowboys football
team. Banc One is paying $45 million.
   Bright Banc, with $3.1 billion in assets, is the biggest failed
thrift in Texas and the largest yet sold by the Resolution Trust
Corp.
   The deal is one of the first in which the RTC has persuaded the
buyer to take a substantial portion of the thrift's loans and other
assets. Banc One is getting $1.7 billion of the S&amp;L's assets,
including residential mortgages, consumer loans, cash and
securities.
   The RTC is keeping $1.4 billion in assets, mostly sour loans and
repossessed real estate. After it sells the assets, it estimates
the government's total loss on the institution will be $1.4
billion, including the $1.1 billion paid to the Ohio company.
   RTC officials had promised a major sale after undergoing a
tongue-lashing earlier this week from members of the Senate Banking
Committee upset with the slow pace of the administration's S&amp;L
cleanup.
   The agency has taken over more than 350 failed thrifts,
disposing of 43 of them. But, in most of the transactions it has
simply transferred the failed institutions' deposits to the new
owner and retained the assets for later sale.
   Bank One Texas, a unit of the Ohio holding company, is assuming
all $2.6 billion of Bright Banc's deposits in 250,000 accounts. The
thrift's 48 offices will remain open during their usual business
hours.
   The acquisition gives Bank One Texas a formidable retail network
in Texas. It would add Bright Banc's branches to the 63 it
currently operates and create a combined institution with about $14
billion in assets, among the 25 largest banking operations in the
nation.
   The RTC did not name the other bidders, but said it received a
total of five, including Banc One's, one other bank, two S&amp;Ls and
one non-financial institution.
   Banc One first ventured into Texas in June with the purchase of
20 failed banks formerly owned by Dallas-based MCorp., getting an
estimated $2 billion in federal aid.
   The Ohio company, ranked among the top handful of most
profitable banks in the nation, has a reputation as a pioneer in
retail banking. It was one of the first banks to offer automated
teller machines. And it has been a leader in packaging obligations
owed by credit card holders into securities for sale to investors.
   Bright Banc was created in the consolidation of three smaller
S&amp;Ls and invested aggressively in Texas commercial real estate. It
got into trouble when property values began to decline following
the 1986 collapse of oil prices.
   The thrift was seized by the government on Feb. 8, only two days
after Bush announced his bailout plan, and was put up for bid Aug.
30.
   William C. Ferguson, a financial institutions consultant in
Irving, Texas, said most of Bright Banc's problems were caused by
loans made before the consolidation.
   He said Bright Banc operated much like a commercial bank, had a
strong operation in credit cards and other consumer services, and
predicted it would mesh well with Banc One.
   ``I really think it will put together the first retail
powerhouse that can compete on a level playing field with NCNB. I
think Banc One will be suprised at how little problem they have
assimilating that organization into theirs,'' he said.
   NCNB Corp. of Charlotte, N.C., acquired Texas' largest bank,
First RepublicBank Corp. of Dallas, in July 1988 in the largest
ever federal bank rescue.
   ``BancOne could not make it with only MCorp. It didn't give them
enough of a market share,'' said Bert Ely, a financial institutions
analyst in Alexandria, Va. ``... My sense is this will not be the
last transaction in Texas involving Banc One.''
