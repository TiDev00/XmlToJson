<HEAD>New Chairman Calls Kennedy Center `Bankrupt'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing
Arts is $15 million in debt and needs $30 million worth of
renovation, its new chairman said on Wednesday.
   ``That's a $45 million nut. It's bankrupt,'' James D. Wolfensohn
said in an interview published in Thursday's editions of The
Washington Post.
   Wolfensohn said White House Chief of Staff John Sununu promised
him that the administration would support the Kennedy Center.
   ``If they don't come through with the money, I think I'll
probably quietly withdraw,'' he said.
   Wolfensohn said the center has lost money because its
programming lacks focus and its board does not provide fundraising
support.

   A Hispanic police officer convicted in the deaths
of two black men that touched off rioting last year was rushed to a
hospital Tuesday night after a reported suicide attempt, police
said.
   William Lozano, 30, was taken to the emergency room of Coral
Reef Hospital around 7:05 p.m., said hospital President Kenneth
Sample. Lozano was in stable condition late Tuesday, but hospital
officials refused to release any details on his condition.
   The emergency call initially came in to police as an attempted
suicide, said Metro-Dade police spokeswoman Myriam Royle.
   When police and rescue units reached Lozano's home in
southwestern Dade County, they found Lozano awake and conscious.
   It was unclear what was wrong with Lozano or if he had taken
some kind of pills, Ms. Royle said.
   The officer's mother, Haydee Lozano; brother Jairo Lozano, also
a Miami police officer; and former partner Dawn Campbell were at
the hospital south of Miami.
   Lozano shot an unarmed motorcyclist to death on Jan. 16, 1989,
and the biker's passenger died in the resulting crash. The deaths
touched off three days of rioting in Miami's black neighborhoods
that resulted in one death, 11 injuries and hundreds of arrests. It
was the fourth round of racial unrest in Miami in the 1980s, all
touched off by the slayings of blacks by white officers or the
acquittal of those officers.
   The Colombian-born officer, who was suspended without pay from
the Miami Police Department, was convicted of manslaughter Dec. 7
and sentenced to seven years in state prison in January. He
appealed the conviction, and has been free on bond.

<HEAD>Leningrad Player Wins New York Open Chess Tournament</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY SOLTIS</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alexander Khalifman, a 24-year-old from
Leningrad, won the 1990 New York Open Chess Tournament Tuesday,
taking the $20,000 first prize.
   Khalifman, playing in his first tournament in the United States,
was the only player among 63 entrants in the prestigious
international section to score 7 points in the nine-round event.
   The field included 32 grandmasters, the highest title holders in
chess short of world champion, and 21 international masters, who
are one level below grandmaster. Eleven countries were represented
in the competition at the Penta Hotel, where players competed for a
total purse of $48,600.
   Khalifman, an international master, clinched first place by
defeating 21-year-old Grandmaster Ferdinand Hellers of Sweden in a
46-move game.
   ``He sacrificed a pawn, but it was a very unclear sacrifice,''
Khalifman said following their five-hour game. ``I made some good
moves and my chances became better and better.''
   Gata Kamsky, 15, of New York, who defected here from the Soviet
Union with his father during last year's New York Open, was among
four players who finished half a point behind Khalifman, in a tie
for second place. Kamsky earned $4,825, as did Grandmaster Helgi
Olafsson of Iceland and Leningrad International Masters Leonid
Yudasin and Vladimir Epishin, who also finished with 6{ points
apiece.
   Competitors earn one point for each win and one-half point for
each draw.
   Their results were good enough to earn Khalifman, Kamsky,
Yudasin and Epishin each an ``international grandmaster norm,'' one
of the qualifying results necessary to be awarded the grandmaster
title.
   Khalifman will be one of the players representing the Soviet
Union in June's interzonal tournament in Madrid, the first
qualification event for the 1993 world championship.
   He said he hoped to be granted the grandmaster title by FIDE,
the international chess federation next month, and thought the
title was overdue. ``I already have four GM (grandmaster) results _
I am ready to become a grandmaster.''
   It normally takes three norms to qualify for the title.
   International Master Patrick Wolff of Belmont, Mass., also
earned a grandmaster norm. Wolff finished in a tie for sixth place
with Grandmasters Joel Benjamin of New York and Smbat Lputian of
Armenia. Each finished the tournament with 6 points and earned
$1033.
   Former World Champion Mikhail Tal of Riga, Latvia, earned 5{
points and finished in a tie with 10 others for ninth place. Each
won $518.
   In Monday's penultimate round, Kamsky defeated Tal in 45 moves.
Tal, who was competing in his first New York tournament, held the
world title in 1960-61.
   Former World Champion Anatoly Karpov, who will be challenging
World Champion Garri Kasparov in New York for the world title in
October, dropped by during the fourth round of the international
competition.
   A total of 710 players competed for an overall purse of $150,000
in six sections of varying playing strengths in the Open, now in
its eighth year. The tournament began April 8.

<HEAD>Antitrust, Clean Air Bills Await Lawmakers Returning From Recess</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress returns today from a 12-day Easter
recess, but the weekend death of a senator and a House turf battle
over clean air are delaying action on major legislation.
   Both the House and Senate were scheduled to convene at noon. But
the death on Sunday of Sen. Spark Matsunaga, D-Hawaii, and plans by
several senators to attend services for him in Honolulu make
significant floor action this week unlikely.
   The House plans to vote Thursday on a measure allowing the
government to take over or revoke the charters of banks and savings
and loan associations that ``launder'' money for drug dealers.
   Also scheduled for a House vote is an antitrust bill, opposed by
the administration, that would make it easier for consumers to sue
manufacturers and retailers engaged in vertical price-fixing.
   The House passed a similar bill in 1987 after Democrats
complained that the Justice Department had prosecuted no cases
involving manufacturers and retailers agreeing on minimum retail
prices since 1981, when Republicans took over the White House. The
Senate, however, never acted on it.
   Operators of discount stores also have complained about
manufacturers refusing to supply them under the practice, which is
illegal under the Sherman Antitrust Act.
   The Office of Management and Budget said it will recommend that
President Bush veto the bill, contending it would inhibit
manufacturers and distributors from making ``pro-competitive''
agreements.
   Bush and his aides, meanwhile, are focusing criticism on
Congress for delays in approving his $800 million package of new
foreign aid for Panama and Nicaragua, including $47 million to help
resettle Contra rebels and their families now living in Honduras.
   The House approved a version of the aid package before the
Easter recess, and the Senate originally was scheduled to act on it
this week. However, that was before Matsunaga's death.
   Clean air legislation approved by the Senate and the House
Energy and Commerce Committee faces new hurdles in the House.
   The Public Works Committee is concerned about language in the
bill that would require the Environmental Protection Agency to cut
off federal highway funding to states that don't implement
pollution-reduction plans.
   Also, the House Ways and Means Committee wants to convert
certain fees in the bill to excise taxes. House leaders do not
expect the bill to be ready for floor action until sometime in
early May.
   After weeks of negotiating behind closed doors, members of the
House Budget Committee hope this week to agree on Bush's $1.2
trillion budget for fiscal 1991. Majority Democrats on the panel
want to cut the president's proposed $303 billion in defense
spending next year by $8 billion.
   Next week, the Senate may take up a long-awaited bill to alter
the way congressional campaigns are financed. Majority Leader
George Mitchell, D-Maine, plans to bring a Democratic version to
the floor primarily to prod negotiations on finding an elusive
compromise.
   Democrats want to impose ceilings on how much candidates can
spend, while the Republican focus is on eliminating the influence
of corporate and labor political action committees.
   Members of both parties, while jockeying for political
advantage, also proclaim a desire to reduce the influence of
unreported money raised and spent by outside groups and the parties
themselves.
   On Tuesday, three advocacy groups _ Public Citizen, Citizen
Action and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group _ announced they
will spend $1 million on newspaper, TV and radio advertising during
the next two weeks to support public campaign financing.
   The groups endorsed an amendment planned by Sen. John Kerry,
D-Mass., that would raise the current voluntary $1 checkoff on tax
returns for financing presidential elections to $3 to add funding
for congressional races.
   Democratic leaders, however, have all but abandoned an effort to
pass public financing after failing on eight attempts to break a
Republican filibuster on the issue two years ago.

<HEAD>Study: Dietary Fiber Can Reduce Colon Cancer Risk Up to 40 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Diets with about twice the amount of fiber and
vegetables now consumed by most Americans can reduce the risk of
colon cancer by about 40 percent, a government study shows.
   A research report published today in the Journal of the National
Cancer Institute reviewed 37 studies conducted since 1973 and found
what it called ``a great deal of evidence'' that diets rich in
fiber and vegetables protect people against colon cancer.
   ``The data ... suggest a reduction in risk of approximately 40
percent for persons consuming diets high in fiber and vegetables,''
the report said. ``Furthermore, there are undeniable cardiovascular
benefits and little likelihood of adverse consequences associated
with this data.''
   Bruce Trock, a researcher at Fox Chase Cancer Center in
Philadelphia, said the evidence ``is powerful'' and very clear.
   Trock said he and two National Cancer Institute researchers,
Elaine Lanza and Peter Greenwald, concluded there was a protective
effect from fiber after a careful analysis of the statistics and
methods used in the 37 dietary studies by different scientists.
Populations in the variety of studies included Japanese, Europeans,
Australians, Americans and New Zealanders.
   Some of the studies were based on questionnaires and others on
actual dietary records.
   ``We classified the studies as to how strong the evidence was,''
Trock said in a telephone interview.
   ``We found of the studies that we thought were well done, there
were only two that did not support the (anti-colon cancer) effect.
When you include some studies where there was some question about
how valid the result was, then there was an additional six that
were not supportive of the effect.''
   Trock said the studies did not emphasize any particular food or
uniformly determine the precise amount of fiber needed to achieve
the protective effect.
   But he said most Americans probably would have to double the
amount of fiber consumed to achieve the cancer protection effect
suggested in the studies.
   ``The average American eats 11 or 12 grams of dietary fiber a
day,'' said Trock. ``The NCI and other organizations are
recommending 20 to 30 grams of dietary fiber a day. So we're really
talking about doubling a typical intake.''
   This can be done, he said, with up to six servings a day of
fruits, whole grain bread, vegetables and whole grain cereals.
   ``It is a relatively simple change that is beneficial for other
diseases and doesn't seem to bring with it any adverse side
effects,'' said Trock.
   People who eat 20 to 30 grams of fiber daily, he said, will
automatically reduce the fat in their diet because ``you don't have
much room for fat.''
   Several studies have suggested that reduction of fat in the diet
can lower the risk of heart disease and of some other types of
cancer, he said.
   Trock cautioned that the studies surveyed did not suggest that
high fiber powders or tablets would accomplish the anti-cancer
effect.
   ``Because the majority of the evidence is based on food rather
than supplements, I think people would be well advised not to
achieve this effect by taking supplements,'' said Trock. ``We worry
that some people think they can just take a pill and then go ahead
and eat a high-fat diet. Maybe some day they can, but right now we
don't think so.''
   The Journal of the National Cancer Institute is published
semi-monthly by NCI, which is one of the National Institutes of
Health.

   A bus carrying a high school track team
rear-ended a truck Tuesday night, sending 42 people to hospitals,
officials said.
   The accident on U.S. 231 in this southeastern Alabama town
apparently occurred after the trailer separated from the truck's
cab and its brake lights went out, said Police Chief Virgil Dobbs.
The bus driver couldn't see the trailer and crashed into it.
   The bus driver, the truck driver and all 40 students aboard the
bus were taken to three hospitals. Some were taken by helicopter
from Fort Rucker Army base in Dothan, 14 miles to the south.
   All the injured were treated for such injuries as whiplash,
bruises and scratches and released, said Dothan schools
Superintendent Gene Watson.
   ``We were very fortunate that there were no serious injuries,''
Watson said.
   The bus was carrying members of the Dothan High School track
team home from a track meet, police said.
   Watson said assistant track coach Edward Fleming, who was
driving the bus, deserved praise for avoiding a 40-foot ravine at
the side of the road.

<HEAD>Judge Freezes Bank Accounts in Colombian Drug Money Scheme</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal investigators following the money
trail left by Colombian drug dealers say the Medellin cocaine
cartel stashed $400 million in 754 U.S. bank accounts _ most of
them now frozen under court order.
   The Justice Department said it won a court order freezing 684
U.S. bank accounts as a result of a painstaking investigation of
financial transactions used by Colombian drug lords to hide at
least $1.2 billion.
   The order, signed by a federal judge in Atlanta, also directed
173 banks in 22 states and the nation's capital to provide records
to prosecutors.
   The Justice Department said Tuesday its long-running
investigation of Colombian drug dealers, dubbed ``Operation Polar
Cap,'' determined that the accounts once contained $400 million the
Medellin cartel amassed from selling cocaine in America.
   All but $50 million of the money was spirited out of this
country and placed into foreign accounts. It then was wired back to
U.S. banks to finance continued cartel operations in this country,
officials said.
   Authorities said they did not know how much money is left in the
accounts. But information from the records should ``point fingers
in a lot of directions,'' helping investigators pursue the money
trail further, said Peter G. Djinis, a Justice Department lawyer.
   ``The manner in which the Medellin cartel has laundered its
money is overwhelming in size and complexity,'' the Justice
Department said in court papers.
   Through an operation known as ``La Mina,'' the cartel laundered
more than $1 billion through the Chase Manhattan Bank and the Bank
of New York in 1987 and 1988, the department said.
   Agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Internal
Revenue Service and the U.S. Customs Service used information from
banks used by the cartel in eight foreign countries to unscramble
the complex web of financial transactions.
   An important break occurred when Colombia turned over bank
records to U.S. authorities after it agreed to extradite Eduardo
Martinez Romero to face charges that he laundered drug proceeds for
the cartel through American banks, Djinis said.
   Martinez ``was the sheepherder'' of the money transfers, Djinis
said.
   The investigation also got a boost in October when Colombian
police seized financial records of alleged cartel member Jose
Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, officials said.
   An analysis of those records enabled U.S. authorities last fall
to freeze $62 million Rodriguez kept in this country, Luxembourg,
Switzerland, Austria and Great Britain.
   Those countries furnished bank records used by investigators to
trace funds frozen this week in the U.S. accounts.
   The U.S. accounts allegedly were set up by Martinez or other
representatives of cartel members, including Pablo Escobar and
Jorge Ochoa, officials said. Escobar and Ochoa, still in Colombia,
are among nine defendants charged with Martinez in the Atlanta case.
   Banco de Occidente of Panama has pleaded guilty to money
laundering charges contained in the indictment.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said the Justice Department's
action ``seeks to lift the veil of secrecy over the financial
network of these narco-terrorists.''
   The money also was traced through banks in Uruguay, Canada,
Colombia and Panama.
   In Miami, Customs Commissioner Carol Hallett said the bank
accounts could not have been traced without the help of the
Panamanian government that replaced Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Justice Department officials said they did not bother to seek
Panamanian bank records until after the U.S. invasion that led to
Noriega's arrest in December on federal drug charges.
   Noriega is awaiting trial in Miami on charges unrelated to
``Operation Polar Cap.''
   The Justice Department said it does not have evidence that the
U.S. banks were knowing participants in the money laundering scheme.

<HEAD>Override Attempt Fails on N.H. Abortion Bill</HEAD>

   Activists on both sides of the abortion
issue looked to the fall legislative elections after the state
House failed to override Gov. Judd Gregg's veto of an abortion
rights bill he said was too liberal.
   ``This is neither a beginning nor an ending,'' Democratic Rep.
Peter Burling, the bill's prime sponsor, said Tuesday. ``We will go
from here, and where we go from here is directly into the campaigns
in the fall.''
   Representatives Tuesday voted 215-157 in favor of the bill,
which allowed unrestricted abortions until a woman's doctor
determined the fetus could survive outside the womb. But the vote
was 33 short of the two-thirds margin needed.
   Republican Stephanie Micklon, one of the bill's sponsors, called
it ``patronizing'' and ``bizarre'' that New Hampshire lets
motorcyclists and drivers choose whether to wear helmets or seat
belts but doesn't extend that freedom of choice to women when it
comes to bearing children.
   ``Abortion is nothing more than planned killing,'' countered
Rep. Frank Reidy, a Democrat. ``Send this killer legislation to
limbo or hell where it belongs. Hitler had his Holocaust in Germany
and it appears we have one in this country.''
   The 1973 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortions
effectively addresses the issue in the state since New Hampshire
has no laws regulating abortions.
   New Hampshire's bill was pushed by pro-choice advocates who fear
the high court might turn greater control over abortion to state
legislatures.
   In his veto message earlier this year, Gregg argued that the
bill would authorize abortion for ``convenience, sex selection, as
a form of birth control and with or without parental notification
or consent in the case of a minor.''
   ``I really don't think a majority of the people in this state
would want New Hampshire to have the most liberal abortion law in
the country,'' Gregg said after the vote.
   After the override attempt failed, activists said they hoped to
elect legislators sympathetic to their views in the fall.
   ``It's harder to lobby and change and influence a legislator
than it is to vote them in and have them representing your views to
begin with,'' said Warren Aldrich, spokesman for the anti-abortion
group New Hampshire for L.I.F.E.
   Abortion-rights activists are working to identify 20,000
sympathetic citizens to encourage them to vote in the fall to
create ``a veto-proof Legislature,'' said Peg Dobbie of the
National Abortion Rights Action League.

   The Bush administration wants delegates to an
international conference to embrace its call for more research on
global warming, despite their grumbling that the United States is
moving too slowly on the problem.
   The two-day White House conference, attended by senior
government officials from 19 countries, has been marked by discord
over whether specific commitments should be made to reduce
so-called greenhouse pollutants, especially carbon dioxide.
   Despite the disagreements, however, senior administration
officials and many of the delegates suggested the conference likely
would go along with a U.S. call for broader research into global
warming and its economic impact.
   The conference concludes later today.
   President Bush told the conference Tuesday that more research is
needed ``to sort out the science'' of the greenhouse effect. He
rejected suggestions that specific response strategies be developed
immediately.
   That brought prompt criticism from some of the European
delegations.
   ``Gaps in knowledge must not be used as an excuse for worldwide
inaction,'' declared Klaus Topfer, the West German environmental
minister. Later he tempered his criticism of the U.S. position,
saying the call for additional research is not altogether bad.
   The West Germans today were to outline details of their proposed
25 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions.
   The United States has argued it is too early to make a
commitment on specific pollution reductions. Instead, it has sought
to focus the conference on gaining international support for more
research on the scientific questions on global warming and the
economic costs.
   Attending the conference were senior environmental ministers
from the 19 countries as well as Cabinet-level officials on
economics, scientific and energy issues.
   Allan Bromley, Bush's science adviser and a conference
co-chairman, told reporters he hoped the delegates would commit to
a broadened international research effort and begin to routinely
consider economic issues in the global warming debate.
   ``President Bush does not feel in any sense the research should
be a substitute for action,'' Bromley said.
   Some European countries have advocated for months that
industrial nations commit themselves to stabilizing carbon dioxide
emissions by the year 2000. Many environmentalists say emissions
should be cut by 20 percent.
   Such pollution cuts would require increased energy conservation,
development of more fuel-efficient automobiles and more energy
efficiency in homes and businesses.
   Talk about further research and economic considerations should
``not distract us from taking action on carbon dioxide
stabilization now,'' Hans Alders, the Dutch environmental minister,
told the conference during a closed working session Tuesday.
   ``We needed Love Canal before hazardous waste was tackled. We
needed a dying River Rhine before waste water was treated. ... My
country has decided to learn the lessons from the past and act on
global warming now,'' Alders told the delegates, according to a
transcript provided by the Dutch delegation.
   Delegates from France, Italy and environmental officials from
the European Community also warned against substituting research
for action.
   ``We didn't come here to argue with the United States or anybody
else,'' said Padraig Flynn, the Irish environmental minister and a
member of the delegation from the European Community.
   But while supporting the call for more research, Flynn added,
``Research must not be used to put off the problems that must be
addressed today.''
   In welcoming the delegates Tuesday, Bush acknowledged the
disagreements, saying, ``I know there's a debate raging out there.''
   Scientists agree that man-made pollution, especially the release
of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels, is causing heat to be
trapped and will result in a warming of the globe. But the severity
of the warming and how specific regions of the Earth will be
affected is not as clear.
   Some computer models have suggested the global temperatures
could increase by as much as four to nine degrees Fahrenheit by the
middle of the next century, causing coastal flooding and a shift of
weather and agriculture patterns. Other scientists say the impact
is uncertain because of a variety of factors, such as the uncertain
effect of clouds.

   The White House says the environment is the
theme of the week. For President Bush, that means mostly golfing,
fishing and boating.
   Brushing aside fresh assaults on his environmental scorecard,
Bush's top advisers in recent days have bent over backward to
trumpet the president's keen interest in outdoor sports as a
manifestation of his concern for the environment.
   Thus, Bush will honor Earth Day on Sunday by fishing in Florida
for tarpon and bonefish.
   Bush needs no prompting to get in touch with the elements. But
the elements he's been getting in touch with _ the well-manicured
greens of country clubs, the azure waters off the Florida keys _
may not exactly match environmentalists' notions of the endangered
biosphere.
   ``I don't think what he's done qualifies him to proclaim himself
the environmental president,'' said Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine. ``He's got a long way to go.''
   And, while praising Bush for helping forge a compromise on clean
air legislation, Mitchell said the president ``missed a golden
opportunity'' in not taking a more assertive role on global warming.
   In fact, Bush received sharp criticism from environmentalists
from around the world this week for the go-slow approach he
advocated at a conference in Washington on global warming _ a
conference he convened.
   Bush often boasts about his environmental record. But he has
been criticized by many for moving too slowly and too timidly on a
range of issues _ from global warming to wetlands policy to
offshore oil production.
   ``The fishing is pretty darn good near these drilling rigs,''
Bush said in a relaxed interview with a group of outdoors writers.
   The interview was one of a series of events organized for the
president over the past few days to stress conservation and
environmental themes leading up to Earth Day.
   ``I'm not suggesting that's the reason to have drilling,'' Bush
continued on the subject of oil rigs as fishing grounds. ``But I am
saying that ... we cannot become totally dependent on foreign oil
and offshore (drilling) offers some potential.''
   Bush's drilling comment did not seem designed to win him points
with Florida environmentalists. Offshore platforms are a touchy
subject there.
   Shortly after taking office, Bush imposed a temporary moratorium
on drilling in environmentally sensitive areas off the Florida and
California coasts. But his administration has done little since,
short of a proposal to move shipping lanes used by oil tankers
further offshore.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater called Bush's visit to
the Florida Keys this weekend a final installment in a week-long
effort to showcase the environment.
   ``On Sunday, Earth Day, he will fish with Curt Gowdy for an
`American Outdoorsman' special that will air later this spring,''
Fitzwater said at a news briefing.
   Other environmental week events included distribution of tree
saplings at the annual Easter Egg Roll and daily ``point of light''
awards for environmental volunteerism.
   ``You've got to have a mix of work and recreation,'' Bush told
reporters as he played 18 holes of golf in the rain at a Bermuda
country club last Saturday after meeting with British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   The environment, in fact, remains one of the most divisive
issues within the administration _ with White House chief of staff
John Sununu and budget director Richard Darman in a continual
tug-of-war with William K. Reilly, chief of the Environmental
Protection Agency.
   So far, Sununu and Darman appear to be winning as Reilly, a
conservation activist before Bush tapped him for the EPA post, has
found many of his environmental proposals watered down, including a
stronger policy for global warming.
   In fact, on negotiations with Capitol Hill on Clean Air Act
amendments, Reilly is likely to be sidelined completely, with White
House and budget office aides doing the prime bargaining, White
House sources said.
   Meanwhile, Bush sees a clear link between the environment and
outdoor athletics.
   ``I'm trying to do my part to get outdoors and show the flag for
sports, fitness and recreation _ taking a few shots in the process
but nothing I can't handle so far,'' he said.
   ``By that, I mean I am determined to go fishing and I think
people understand,'' he told the outdoors writers.
   ``I'm down there (in Florida) to have fun,'' Bush added,
previewing this weekend's trip. ``And if we can help by pointing
out the sensitivity of the environment there, the ecological
balance in the Everglades, I want to do that.''

   More than 1,000 people paid tribute Tuesday to
U.S. Sen. Spark M. Matsunaga, who died of cancer last week, in a
ceremony inside the Capitol highlighted by Hawaiian tradition.
   Matsunaga's body was flown here aboard Air Force II from
Washington, accompanied by family members and a military honor
guard, and was taken to the Capitol for 24 hours of public viewing
before a funeral service Wednesday.
   The 73-year-old Hawaii Democrat died Saturday at a Toronto
hospital, where he had gone for treatment of prostate and bone
cancer.
   Kamaki Kanahele, president of a native Hawaiian organization,
chanted in traditional Hawaiian as he led the honor guard carrying
the flag-drapped casket from a hearse to a large white canopy set
up inside the Capitol.
   The Rev. Abraham Akaka, brother of U.S. Rep. Daniel Akaka, asked
the crowd to join hands as they sang ``Hawaii Aloha,'' before he
began his blessing with prayers delivered in Hawaiian and English.
   Gov. John Waihee held the umeke bowl of King Kamehameha, a large
wooden calabash, from which the Rev. Akaka dabbed holy water with a
cluster of ti leaves to anoint the casket.
   ``Brother Sparky. As all who love you, from all our islands,
from across our nation and world come to say aloha and pay their
respects ... may the blessing of God and our aloha ... kiss you
through the holy hours of today and tomorrow,'' Akaka prayed.
   Waihee then led the led more than 100 dignitaries in a
procession to pay last respects to the man who represented Hawaii
in Washington for 28 years.
   A U.S. Navy wind ensemble, seated on a second-floor balcony
above the courtyard, played ``America the Beautiful'' and ``Battle
Hymn of the Republic'' as mourners filed past the casket.
   Plans called for an all-night vigil at the casket, begun by
women in the various Hawaiian royal societies wearing full-length
black dresses and hats and colorful flower leis.
   Also participating in the vigil were members of Matsunaga's
World War II military unit, the 100th Infantry Battalion.
   Late in the evening, friends said they planned to invite people
to an informal sing-along, an activity Matsunaga enjoyed.
   A delegation from Congress, led by Hawaii's U.S. Sen. Daniel
Inouye, D-Hawaii, and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, was expected in Honolulu Wednesday for a funeral service
at Central Union Church.
   Matsunaga is to be buried Thursday in private ceremonies at the
National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Punchbowl Crater,
overlooking downtown Honolulu.

   Bill Cosby is donating $150,000 from two
performances to pay for next year's Penn Relays, an annual track
meet at the University of Pennsylvania.
   ``I've run in that Penn Relays since age 12,'' the 52-year-old
Philadelphia native and former Temple University Athlete said
Tuesday.
   This year's Penn Relays begin April 24 with 13,000 entrants,
from elementary school through masters. A group organized by New
York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner is contributing about
$100,000 for this year's meet after the loss of two major sponsors
shrank the event's operating budget by about $75,000.
   Cosby said that running in the Penn Relays is a ``big moment not
only for the kids running, but for their families as well.''

violence-ridden housing project.
   The proceeds from ``We're All in the Same Gang'' will go to
Project Build, an anti-gang organization in the Watts district. The
song is to be released May 15.
   Publicity for the event said the participants would call for a
truce between gangs, but the rappers chose their words carefully
Tuesday. Previous pleas for gang peace in Los Angeles have failed.
   ``I'm not trying to stop gang violence,'' said Def Jef. ``I'm

should be stopped, but before you can stop it, you have to go to
the source of where it started.''

   Elizabeth Taylor, hospitalized for a
week, dismissed rumors she has AIDS. Her doctor reported she has
pneumonia.
   The 58-year-old actress entered Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital
on April 10 for what was reported as a severe sinus infection. Her
condition worsened and she was moved Monday to St. John's Hospital
and Health Center.
   ``I would like to dispel the plethora of rumors that have been
circulating that I have an AIDS-related condition,'' she said in a
statement. ``I have an annual physical and have been tested for the
disease and the test results are negative.''
   Her physician, Dr. Patricia Murray, said in the statement that
test results revealed Miss Taylor has pneumonia.
   ``She is currently being treated intravenously with antibiotics
and will remain hospitalized,'' said Murray.

   Johnny Carson's first wife says she is living in
a small hotel with no job and wants a judge to raise her alimony
from $13,500 to $120,000 a year.
   Joan ``Jody'' Carson, 63, said Tuesday she hasn't spoken to the
father of her three sons in ``many, many, many years'' and recent
attempts to reach him have been unsuccessful. ``He won't really
talk to me at all,'' she said.
   Carson married his high-school sweetheart in 1949. A postnuptial
agreement called for Mrs. Carson to receive $15,000 a year plus 15
percent of Carson's earnings over $100,000, said her lawyer, Raoul
Felder. They divorced in 1963.
   When Mrs. Carson remarried in 1970, she signed a new agreement
giving her $13,500 annually and certain bonuses that ended in 1979.
That marriage ended in 1973.
   Carson, 64, reportedly earns $40 million a year. Carson's
attorney did not return a phone call Tuesday.

   Suprati Mahana has been working the fetid
alleyways of Bombay's red-light district since she was sold into
prostitution four years ago. Ms. Mahana, 16, doesn't know what AIDS
is.
   ``Why should I force my customer to use a condom,'' she said as
she sat on a small bed in a rat-infested bordello. ``Besides, if
the men give it to us, we'll just give it back to them. I'll go to
a doctor.''
   The sprawling slums of one of India's biggest cities have become
a breeding ground for the deadly virus and health officials fear
that if the government doesn't act fast, India will be faced with
Asia's first AIDS epidemic.
   About 10,000 prostitutes in this city of 10 million people are
believed to be infected with the virus, AIDS specialists say, five
times higher than three years ago.
   Hundreds of professional blood donors also carry the virus
although the government has been slow to screen donations. A 1989
survey showed the incidence of AIDS-infected blood had increased
almost 40 times since 1987 to more than 1 percent.
   Many eunuchs who work the red-light districts of Bombay, Madras
and New Delhi are also infected, doctors say.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims prone to
infections and cancer. It is spread most often through sexual
contact, needles shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood
products, and from pregnant women to their offspring.
   Of the world's 20 worst national AIDS epidemics, 18 are in poor
countries, although the United States has the most cases, more than
120,000. Since India's first reported AIDS-related death in June
1986, at least 17 people have died.
   In Asia, while Thailand has more people carrying the virus,
Indian health officials worry that their country _ with 880 million
people and a weak health system _ will soon top the list.
   ``We could have an epidemic situation in 10 years,'' said Dr.
S.M. Bhadkamkar, the top health official in Bombay. ``Every six
months the number of AIDS carriers is doubling.''
   Critics say Bhadkamkar and his colleagues in New Delhi have done
little to stop the disease. After a brief flurry in 1986, there
have been few government-backed educational drives. More than 90
percent of the $8 million used to battle AIDS goes into testing and
less than 5 percent into education and prevention.
   Solutions from the medical community have also been criticized.
Two years ago, A.S. Paintal, who now heads the Indian Council on
Medical Research, called for a bill outlawing Indians from having
sex with foreigners and Indians living overseas. It was never
introduced.
   ``The government is doing nothing about AIDS,'' said Dr. I.S.
Gilada, a crusading specialist on the disease who founded India's
first AIDS clinic in Bombay several years ago. ``They have their
heads in the sand.''
   ``In Thailand, they have posters on almost every street corner
and condoms everywhere. In Zaire and the Ivory Coast, they use
music to fight it,'' Gilada said. ``In India, the professionals say
they're still studying the problem.''
   Gilada, a government doctor, is a one-man anti-AIDS publicity
machine. Bureaucrats accuse him of seeking the limelight, but his
response is that the problem is too serious to worry about style.
   When the first AIDS patient died in Bombay's J.J. Hospital in
1988, government officials told Gilada to certify the cause of
death as tuberculosis, Gilada said.
   He refused and publicized the death. The government tried to
transfer him to a leprosy unit outside the city, Gilada said. A
court ruling prevented his move.
   Bhadkamkar declined to comment on Gilada's allegations.
   Now Gilada spends much of his time in Bombay's three red-light
districts, attempting to educate prostitutes and professional blood
donors about the disease.
   Prostitution is legal in India. Many prostitutes come from the
countryside. Homosexuality is illegal but tolerated if the men join
a certain Hindu cult.
   One organization of prostitutes, the Neglected and Helpless
Woman's Association, has crusaded against AIDS with Gilada's help.
Its president, Rukminibai Barsode, said she has received no help
from the government.
   ``A rich businessman gave us 10,000 condoms for World Health Day
last April, but the government won't give us one rupee,'' said the
50-year-old madam, speaking out of her office on 14th Alley. ``The
government also ignores any attempts to keep our daughters and the
young street urchins from the business.''
   As she spoke, three 12-year-old girls in braids and shabby
dresses sat together on a rock near the door. They poked each other
and giggled. All three said their mothers were planning on making
them work as prostitutes.
   Ms. Barsode said pimps have stopped many prostitutes from
joining her organization, which has 500 members. On 13th Alley,
Suprati Mahana said she wanted to join but her ``uncle'' wouldn't
let her.
   Gilada has also called on the government to pay professional
blood donors who test positive for the AIDS virus not to give their
blood.
   Partly because of Gilada's jostling, Bombay is starting to take
action.
   In January, Maharashtra state, which includes Bombay, began
screening all blood donations, Bhadkamkar said. In May, it will
start a comprehensive AIDS education program aimed at college
students, industrial workers, prostitutes and professional blood
donors.
   ``We are committed to attacking this disease,'' Bhadkamkar said.
``And now we have to.''

   Members of a top Contra rebel
delegation toned down their demands that the Sandinista army
disband along with their own forces after meeting late Tuesday with
President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro.
   A representative of Mrs. Chamorro's coalition said afterwards
that the possibility of finally bringing peace to Nicaragua is
``enormous,'' dismissing Sandinista predictions of a fresh outbreak
of fighting.
   Maj. Gen. Joaquin Cuadra, deputy defense minister and chief of
staff of the Sandinista army, said that ``with political will,''
the Contras could be dismantled by the time Mrs. Chamorro takes
office, April 25.
   Rebel leaders have said they will not lay down their arms until
the military, built and dominated by the Sandinistas during their
decade in power, is dismantled and replaced by a police force.
   But after meeting with Mrs. Chamorro, Contra leader Oscar
Sovalbarro seemed to soften his tone and said demands that the
military disarm ``are aspects that must be negotiated.''
   Antonio Lacayo, Mrs. Chamorro's son-in-law and a leading
official in her coalition, dismissed Sandinista claims that a new
round of war could break out: ``There are enormous possibilities of
assuring peace in Nicaragua.''
   A spokesman for the president-elect's United National Opposition
coalition (UNO), Luis Sanchez, said the Contra demand to cull the
army of Sandinista officers had not been discussed and there were
no plans to discuss it. He said the talks were progressing and
focused on a cease-fire and moving Contra fighters to security
zones where they are to turning in their weapons. He said he was
optimistic a cease-fire agreement could be signed Wednesday.
   The conciliatory statements followed a morning of hard-line
stances and alarmist headlines in the Sandinista press.
   Sovalbarro had been standing firm on a Contra demand that there
would be no peace unless the Contras and the Sandinista army
disbanded simultaneously.
   ``There is no date for disarming,'' he said earlier Tuesday.
``That is part of the negotiations.''
   ``We have opted that there be a total demilitarization of the
armed force in Nicaragua,'' Sovalbarro added. ``We are not
demanding to share power with the new government.''
   Aristides Sanchez, another member of the delegation, said the
Contras wanted to do away with the military entirely, as Costa Rica
did in 1948. He said the rebels want the army replaced ``by a
national police like the one in Costa Rica.''
   But the deputy defense minister, Cuadra, said the Contra demand
that the Sandinistas simultaneously disarm was ``not subject to
discussion.''
   He spoke prior to a meeting of UNO, Contra and Sandinista army
representatives at the Managua headquarters of the Organization of
American States. The OAS and the United Nations are helping
supervise the Contra demobilization.
   Pro-Sandinista newspapers had quoted the general secretary of
the Sandinista Labor Federation as saying Sandinista workers would
seize ``strategic points'' in Managua if the Contras refuse to
disarm. The union claims 100,000 members.
   One such daily, El Nuevo Diario, said in a front-page headline:
``Either the Contras Demobilize before the 25th or a General Strike
Explodes.''
   Mrs. Chamorro was elected to a six-year term in February
balloting that saw her 14-party coalition defeat the Sandinistas.
   Her administration is counting on a peaceful Nicaragua to
deliver on her key campaign promise of reviving the economy.
   Under a protocol agreement signed by UNO and the administration
of outgoing President Daniel Ortega, Mrs. Chamorro pledged to
respect the army's ``professionalism'' but vowed not to let
officers serve as political party leaders, as is now the case.
   Both Ortega and Mrs. Chamorro have called on the Contras to
disband. The Contras and UNO signed an agreement on March 23 for
the Contras to disarm but set no firm date.
   In another development, La Prensa, the evening newspaper owned
by Mrs. Chamorro's family, said Bernard Aronson, the assistant U.S.
secretary of state for the region, was expected to visit Thursday
for talks with the Sandinistas and UNO. Washington backed the
Contras in their nine-year war with the Sandinistas but now
supports Mrs. Chamorro's call for their dissolution.

<HEAD>Survey Says Experts Split on Diversion of Funds for AIDS Research</HEAD>

   Biomedical scientists are almost evenly
divided about whether the government is taking too much money from
cancer, heart disease and other medical studies to support AIDS
research, a congressional study finds.
   The survey released Tuesday by the Office of Technology
Assessment said most of the experts believe AIDS research ``has
made many important contributions to advances in the biomedical and
behavioral sciences'' and that virtually every medical specialty
has benefited from money spent on AIDS studies.
   In the current fiscal year that ends Sept. 30, the federal
government is spending about $2.9 billion for treatment and
prevention of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Research into
the human immunodeficiency virus or HIV, which causes AIDS, is
about $1.16 billion.
   ``Critics of rising expenditures on HIV disease point out that
HIV funding has exceeded funding for heart disease and rivals
funding for cancer, despite the much greater number of deaths from
these latter diseases,'' OTA said.
   The report said almost 10 percent, or $743.5 million, of the
National Institutes of Health's 1990 budget goes to AIDS funding.
   To determine how the federal AIDS spending is affecting other
biomedical fields, the OTA sent questionnaires to 400 scientists
and received completed replies from 148.
   The study said 48 percent of those who responded ``agreed or
strongly agreed that too much research funding has been diverted''
to AIDS research from other fields. Forty-four percent ``disagreed
or strongly disagreed with this statement,'' it said.
   Asked to evaluate federal spending for AIDS research, 45.7
percent of the scientists surveyed said the amount was ``about
right,'' 18.1 percent said it was too high, 31.2 percent said it
was too low and 5.1 percent had no opinion.
   There were 87 scientists with some professional activity related
to AIDS in the survey, and 51.7 percent of those believed the level
of AIDS spending was ``about right.'' One-third called it too low,
and 10.3 percent saw it as too high.
   Among the 49 surveyed scientists with no professional AIDS
activity, 34.7 percent called federal spending about right, 32.7
percent said it was too high and 26.5 percent found it too low.
   Dr. Mervyn Silverman, president of the American Foundation for
AIDS Research, said more money generally needs to be spend for
health care.
   ``We need to maintain and increase the amount of research in
AIDS, but we should not be doing this at the expense of other
diseases,'' he said. ``The impact of heart disease, cancer and AIDS
are all terrible in our society and we should be dealing adequately
with all of them.''
   In the OTA survey, more than half the experts agreed that each
of nine basic biological sciences enjoyed at least some spinoff
benefit from the AIDS research.
   Among the medical specialties, the experts said virtually every
one has received some spinoff benefit. At least 40 percent of the
experts said the fields of medicine most helped by knowledge from
AIDS research are oncology (study of tumors); neurology (study of
the nervous system); hematology (study of the blood); pulmonary
medicine and general infectious disease treatment.
   The AIDS research, the experts said, also has stimulated public
health studies in teaching people about hazardous behaviors, such
as drug and alcohol abuse, and in the public control of all
sexually transmitted diseases.
   Even sociology has benefited from AIDS research, the experts
said, by improving public understanding about social stigma and
prejudice.
   Scientists surveyed were from universities, government agencies
and private organizations. Seventy-two percent were physicians and
the rest held Ph.D. degrees in biomedical sciences. More than half
are in research, and 16 percent are in patient care.
   The Office of Technology Assessment is an agency of Congress
that conducts scientific research into issues that might affect
federal legislation.

   A Ku Klux Klansman arrested for wearing a hood in
violation of state law has his day in court Thursday in a
confrontation over whether the Constitution guarantees the right of
anonymous free speech.
   ``Any law that infringes on any person's First Amendment rights
infringes on all our rights,'' said Michael Hauptman, Klansman
Shade Miller's lawyer.
   Miller was charged with violating the 1951 law in February after
wearing a KKK hood at the county courthouse in Lawrenceville.
   The case is being watched closely by civil rights leaders, who
credit the law with helping reduce Klan violence in the last four
decades.
   ``Obviously, we think it is a very relevant issue,'' said Earl
Shinhoster, Southeast regional director of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People.
   ``The Klan uses anonymity as an instrument of terror and fear,''
said Shinhoster, who plans to testify for the state at Thursday's
State Court hearing. ``That has been the whole reason for
constructing their uniform and regalia as it is.''
   Hauptman, president of the American Civil Liberties Union in
Georgia, said the anti-mask law is so vague that it can be used to
restrict the rights of any individual or group deemed offensive by
the government.
   ``If a gay rights group decided they wanted to have a massive
rally, including 20,000 Atlantans who haven't come out of the
closet, this law would prohibit them from putting bags on their
heads,'' said Hauptman, who has taken the case as a private lawyer
rather than as a member of the ACLU.
   Without the protection of masks, Klansmen could face harassment
on the job or from neighbors who oppose the KKK, Hauptman said.
   State officials contend the law is clear and specifically
targeted at hate groups such as the Klan.
   ``The law is not vague. It says do not wear a mask unless you
fall within one of the exceptions,'' said David M. Fuller, chief
assistant solicitor for Gwinnett County, who will represent the
state at the hearing.
   The law makes it a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in
jail and a $1,000 fine to wear a hood or a mask to conceal one's
identity when on public property. Exceptions include holiday
costumes on the day of the holiday, masks for use in sports,
theatrical garb or gas masks.
   ``It does not violate free speech because it is in the pursuit
of a legitimate public interest, which is to keep the public free
from threats and intimidation,'' Fuller said.
   Superior Court Senior Judge Osgood Williams, who as a legislator
helped write the mask law, said, ``It's always been my feeling that
the bill, in a large measure, brought about the demise of the Ku
Klux Klan as a potent force. It still should be the law of the
land.''
   Leonard Zeskind, research director for the Atlanta-based Center
for Democratic Renewal, which monitors white supremacist
activities, said anti-mask laws are worth protecting.
   ``The mask is, in our opinion, not an element of freedom of
expression but an attempt to conceal,'' Zeskind said. ``The purpose
of the mask is to conceal the (Klan) member and the only purpose of
concealing the member in public has to do with worry over law
enforcement finding out about who is committing crimes.''
   Zeskind said the Klan's reason for launching this challenge may
have less to do with regaining the right to wear a mask than
inspiring its membership.
   He said Klan groups have suffered several setbacks in Georgia
courts over the past couple of years, ``and this may be an attempt
to rally the troops around some legal effort. This may be an
internal thing.''
   Fuller said virtually every state has an anti-mask law, though a
few _ including those in California, Tennessee and Massachusetts _
have been struck down.
   But he said he believed Georgia's law was more narrowly written
than those that were ruled unconstitutional.

<HEAD>Democrats Using Earth Day Focus to Whack GOP on Environment</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Democratic Party's congressional campaign
arm is joining the Earth Day celebration in a partisan fashion,
launching a television ad campaign that takes a swipe at the GOP's
environmental record.
   Two ads produced for the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee are scheduled to be broadcast today, Thursday and Sunday
in seven congressional districts where the environment is expected
to be a major campaign issue.
   Those districts are in New Jersey, Rhode Island, two in
California, New York, Colorado and Alaska. Four currently are
represented by Democrats and three by Republicans, but two of the
GOP lawmakers _ Claudine Schneider in Rhode Island and Hank Brown
in Colorado _ are giving up their House seats to run for the Senate.
   The ads also are to be aired nationally Thursday night on the
Cable News Network.
   DCCC spokesman Howard Schloss would not disclose the budget for
the campaign but said the ads would air from five to 10 times a day
in the targeted districts.
   ``I would simply say that with these spots the DCCC is polluting
the nation's airwaves with misinformation,'' said John Roberts,
communications director for the National Republican Congressional
Committee. ``If the Democratic Party has such an edge on the
environment, why did it take a Republican president (George Bush)
to get the Clean Air Act moving through Congress?''
   One of the ads doesn't mention the GOP but promotes the
Democratic Party as most committed to protecting and cleaning up
the environment.
   ``As we approach a new century, we must focus on the threat of
global warming, proper disposal of hazardous wastes and the
prevention of industrial disasters,'' the narrator says as
environmental images are shown. ``The Democrats will continue their
commitment to protecting our environment.''
   The second ad goes after the Republican Party. It shows pictures
of workers cleaning up after the Exxon Valdez oil spill as the
narrator says:
   ``When the Valdez went on the rocks, Republicans took a
wait-and-see attitude. Like they did with the fires at Yellowstone.
Like they're doing with nuclear waste at Rocky Flats. But while the
Republicans waited, the Democrats went to work, demanding the
federal government take over the cleanup. The Democrats have been
coming to the rescue of our environment for years. Because we can't
afford to wait.''
   The seven congressional districts and the incumbents are:
   _New Jersey's 3rd, Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone.
   _Rhode Island's 2nd, Schneider, who is challenging Democratic
Sen. Claiborne Pell, leaving the House race without an incumbent.
   _California's 19th and 36th districts, represented by Republican
Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino and Democratic Rep. George E. Brown Jr.,
respectively.
   _New York's 1st, Democratic Rep. George J. Hochbrueckner.
   _Colorado's 4th, Brown, who is running for the Senate seek being
vacated by GOP Sen. William Armstrong, leaving the House race open.
   _Alaska's statewide district, Republican Rep. Don Young.

<TEXT>
   Colombia's top generals said one of the
world's most powerful cocaine cartels is being torn apart in a
dispute over its use of violence to intimidate the government.
   On Tuesday, the chief of the country's secret police, Gen.
Miguel Maza, said some of the cartel's leaders are opposed to the
organization's campaign of killings and bombings in the belief that
the violence is making the government more resolute in its fight
against the drug trade.
   President Virgilio Barco ordered a government crackdown on the
traffickers in August.
   In response, the leader of the Medellin cocaine cartel, Pablo
Escobar, ordered a campaign of bombings and assassinations that has
claimed more than 200 lives.
   Since beginning its crackdown, the government has extradited 15
traffickers to the United States and its security forces have
seized millions of dollars in trafficker's property and raided
several cocaine labs.
   One of the cartel's leaders, Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, was killed
in a shootout with police in December. Since then, police and army
officials have said they are close to capturing the four remaining
leaders of the cartel.
   Now, security officials say internal pressures are causing the
cartel to fall apart.
   On Sunday, a statement purportedly issued by cartel dissidents
said some traffickers oppose Escobar's use of violence.
   There was widespread skepticism in Colombia over the
communique's authenticity. Colombia's traffickers have for years
used violence as a tool in building and maintaining their cocaine
empire.
   Entire families have been killed. Government officials, judges,
journalists and even a presidential candidate have been murdered.
   Despite the doubts, the head of the armed forces, Gen. Oscar
Botero said Monday that the communique was authentic and indicated
that the cartel was falling apart.
   On Tuesday, Colombia's largest daily, El Tiempo, published an
interview with secret police chief Maza.
   Maza said the cartel is disintegrating and dozens of traffickers
are breaking with Escobar. He said he was basing his assertion on
intercepted communications from the cartel.
   Maza could not be reached by The Associated Press, but a
spokeswoman at his office said the interview was accurate.
   El Tiempo also quoted police Gen. Octavio Vargas as saying that
Escobar has marked for death 27 people accused of being police
informants.
   Maza and other generals have not been able to explain why the
intercepted communications have not led to additional arrests.

<HEAD>Officials Say Cities Suffering From Undercount</HEAD>

   The 1990 census is bypassing a few people.
Like those who live in the odd zip code, subdivision or skyscraper
in Houston.
   Officials from that city and others gathered Tuesday to trade
tales of woe and ask the federal government for help in the
high-stakes headcount that will determine how much aid they'll get
and how many congressional representatives they'll have for the
next decade.
   ``There is still time for an accurate count,'' said Hulbert
James, director of special projects for New York City.
   But he and others said that will only be possible if the
government provides more money for the count, keeps its district
offices open well into next month and launches a major publicity
campaign to persuade people to fill out forms and talk to Census
Bureau counters.
   Even President Bush needs to get into the act, they said, by
making public service announcements that tell people they can
safely open the door and talk to enumerators who show up to count
them in person.
   James said the 1990 headcount is in ``a crisis situation'' in
the cities. He and other officials, members of a census task force
of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, gave snapshots of what is going
on in their cities:
   _Houston officials initially estimated 10 percent of city
residents did not get census questionnaires and were projecting a
maximum $40 million loss due to undercounting. But that was before
a special census phone line started getting 900 calls a day from
people who didn't receive forms.
   ``We discovered that whole zip codes were being missed,'' said
Patty Knudson. She said entire subdivisions were skipped and entire
skyscrapers filled with condominiums failed to receive forms.
   _Jessica Heinz, deputy city attorney in Los Angeles, said 70,000
forms were returned to the post office as undeliverable. And she
said 108 of 556 people in a recent survey did not recall receiving
census forms.
   _Jai P. Ryu of Baltimore said 81,000 census forms were returned
as undeliverable to a Towson, Md., office that serves the Baltimore
area. ``We believe most of them are from Baltimore, which means
well over 10 percent did not get their forms,'' Ryu said.
   _James said New York City would lose about $150 a year for each
person that did not fill out a census form. The initial projection
was a $100 million a year loss for 10 years, until the next census,
he said, But mailing problems will probably drive the loss up
higher. James said the city found 1,000 blocks with more than a
half-million residents that were not on the census list of
addresses. He suggested many still were not on the list at mailing
time.
   The Census Bureau has estimated as many as 4.5 million people
did not get census forms. James said the number may be closer to 9
million.
   He and others also complained that the Immigration and
Naturalization Service made high-profile sweeps of immigrant
neighborhoods at the same time the Census Bureau was trying to
encourage illegal aliens to fill out the confidential forms.
   James said there had been a number of INS raids in the past
seven weeks in the Washington Heights area of New York, home to
many immigrants from the Dominican Republic. Others cited recent
raids in Los Angeles and San Jose, Calif., and San Antonio, Texas.
   ``We did not expect that there would be public raids during this
period,'' James said.
   New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston, Dade County, Fla.,
the state of California and groups representing mayors, blacks and
Hispanics are already in court suing the Census Bureau on the
theory that any count will be inaccurate.

<HEAD>Value of Tobacco Exports Doubled During '80s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The value of tobacco exports doubled in the
1980s, contributing nearly $25 billion to the U.S. trade account
during the decade, according to an industry report.
   The study, released Tuesday by the Tobacco Merchants Association
of the United States, said exports increased to almost $5 billion
in 1989 from $2.5 billion in 1980.
   ``Last year alone, while U.S. industry as a whole produced a
merchandise trade deficit of about $109 billion, the U.S. tobacco
industry contributed $4.2 billion to the positive side of the
nation's trade ledger,'' the association said.
   The association, in its 75th year, said it represents all
sectors of the tobacco industry, including growers, manufacturers,
suppliers, dealers, distributors, securities firms and management
consultants.
   Farrell Delman, president of the association, said the growth of
tobacco exports since 1985 _ when they were valued at $2.15 billion
_ is attributable to ``the opening up of key Asian cigarette
markets, as well as sustained exports to the Middle East and
Europe.''
   Tobacco exports have come under fire from some U.S. health
authorities and others who contend it is wrong to push sales
overseas when Americans are being advised to quit smoking because
of health risks.
   Before he retired last Oct. 1, then-Surgeon General C. Everett
Koop told Congress it was ``the height of hypocrisy to export
tobacco.'' Koop had conducted a vigorous anti-smoking campaign
while in office.
   Dean Kleckner, president of the American Farm Bureau Federation,
said American farmers and the U.S. economy benefit from the recent
upswing in tobacco exports.
   Kleckner, in a statement, said that increased sales of tobacco
leaf and products are a result of American farmers producing they
type of product wanted by foreign customers. He also cited the
removal of overseas trade barriers, primarily in Japan, Taiwan and
South Korea.
   ``Much of the increase is due to aggressive action by U.S. trade
officials to open overseas markets,'' Kleckner said. ``Farm Bureau
has been a vigorous supporter of liberalized trade for all
agricultural products, and we are pleased with the gains in
tobacco.''
   Kleckner said the $25 billion in tobacco exports during the
1980s has been important to the U.S. economy as well as the trade
balance.
   ``The success of tobacco has meant thousands of jobs in this
country and has provided many farm families a good income,'' he
said.

   The Agriculture Department has approved
subsidized sales of 200,000 metric tons of wheat flour to 19
African nations.
   Acting Undersecretary Ann M. Veneman said Tuesday that 16 of the
countries have not previously been eligible for the subsidized
flour sales under the Export Enhancement Program, or EEP. Three
countries _ Benin, Central African Republic and Zaire _ had
participated before.
   The 16 newcomers are Angola, Burundi, Cameroon, Congo, Gabon,
Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Rwanda, Sierre
Leone, Tanzania, Togo and Zambia.
   ``Sales of wheat flour will be made to buyers in these 19
countries at competitive world prices,'' the announcement said. The
sales will be made through regular commercial channels by private
exporting companies.
   A metric tons is about 2,205 pounds.
   The EEP arrangement allows private exporters to sell wheat,
flour and other designated commodities to specified countries at
reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition.
   Exporters then collect free government surpluses of grain or
other products as bonuses, or subsidies, to make up for the reduced
prices.

   Some parts of the northern Great Plains
continue to suffer from extended drought, but the government
reports that elsewhere the moisture situation shows a lot of plus
marks.
   ``Winter wheat was mostly good to fair'' during the week of
April 9-15, the Joint Agricultural Weather Facility said Tuesday.
``In Kansas, winter wheat was mostly good. Disease and insect
problems were light.''
   Crop conditions were said to be good in Oklahoma and fair to
good in Texas, although cool weather slowed wheat growth.
   ``Some freeze damage occurred in Missouri, where the crop was
fair to good,'' the report said. ``Winter wheat was good to fair in
Colorado, Montana and Nebraska.''
   But lack of moisture put stress on South Dakota's winter wheat
crop, which was reported in fair-to-good condition. Winter wheat
was said to be in good-to-fair shape in the Pacific Northwest and
the Corn Belt.
   Cotton planting was reported 16 percent completed, about on
schedule with the average for this time of year. About 3 percent of
the corn acreage was planted, one percentage point behind the usual
pace.
   The facility is operated by the departments of Agriculture and
Commerce. Weekly reports cover crop conditions but do not include
production forecasts.

   The congressional investigative agency, citing
flaws in the Apache attack helicopter, will recommend that the Army
abandon its plans to buy the final 132 aircraft, Capitol Hill
sources say.
   The General Accounting Office will make its recommendations to
the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on oversight and
investigations at a hearing Thursday, said the sources, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   The panel also has subpoenaed Army Secretary Michael Stone, who
formerly was the Army's chief acquisition executive.
   The Army said it responded to the subcommittee's initial request
for Stone by offering ``two expert witnesses with the most
knowledge on development, fielding and sustainment of the Apache.''
   They were Maj. Gen. Donald Williamson, commanding general of the
Army Aviation Systems Command, and Maj. Gen. William Forster,
director of requirements integration and deep operations and a
former Apache program manager.
   However, the subcommittee refused the offer and subpoenaed
Stone. A spokeswoman, Maj. Nancy Burt, said he would appear.
   The Army plans to buy 807 Apaches, its top-line attack
helicopter, from McDonnell Douglas Corp. at a cost of $12 billion.
It is committed to 675; the last 132 would cost $1.49 billion,
which has already been appropriated for the current fiscal year.
   Congressional investigators and a recent Army memorandum
described widespread problems with the aircraft.
   Although the Apache is considered an all-weather aircraft,
pilots had difficulty flying the helicopter through rain during the
early hours of the U.S. invasion of Panama last December.
   Rain and humidity caused moisture to build up on the
helicopter's sensitive electronic components, forcing mechanics to
use heaters to dry out the parts.
   Improvements in the weather also prevented further problems.
   From first deliveries in 1986 through last December, the Army
had received 534 Apaches. Investigators found that the helicopter
could perform all assigned missions an average of 49 percent of the
time, a low rate for an Army helicopter.
   In addition, the investigators found that as an Apache's flight
hours increased, its ability to perform decreased.
   The GAO began its inquiry into the Apache at the request of Rep.
John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House subcommittee, and is
planning to issue a full report later this year.
   Complaints last year by Army Col. R. Dennis Kerr about the
Apache's unreliability in field exercises prompted Dingell's call
for an investigation.

<HEAD>Rights Activists Blast Ruling on Drug Use in Religious Rites</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Civil libertarians and Indian rights activists
say the Supreme Court is abandoning its role as protector of
unpopular minorities by permitting states to punish people who use
illegal drugs in religious rituals.
   The court, by a 6-3 vote Tuesday, ruled that Oregon officials
may deny unemployment benefits to two fired drug counselors who
took small amounts of peyote in Indian religious ceremonies. The
court said there is no constitutional right to take illegal drugs
for religious reasons.
   ``This court seems to find it difficult to step outside of a
white, middle-class mindset,'' said Jack Trope of the Association
on American Indian Affairs. ``They really find it hard to
understand what other cultures may feel and think. This (Indian)
religion has a long tradition and is as spiritually worthwhile as
any to which they might belong.''
   John Rosenthal, a spokesman for the American Civil Liberties
Union, said the ruling is ``terrible mostly because it does an end
run around'' the Supreme Court's longstanding commitment to
religious freedom.
   He said the ruling is the first in 50 years in which the court
has treated a religious freedom claim with so little sympathy.
   Lenora Begay, spokeswoman for the Navajo Nation, said, ``To
punish individuals because of their religious beliefs is beyond
comprehension and ... an act of extreme ignorance.''
   But Attorney General Dave Frohnmayer of Oregon welcomed the
ruling.
   ``We have always insisted the state is not required to pay
people for using illegal substances no matter what their religious
beliefs might be,'' he said.
   Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the court, said it ``would
be courting anarchy'' to let a few do what is illegal for everyone
else.
   ``We have never held that an individual's religious beliefs
excuse him from compliance with an otherwise valid law prohibiting
the conduct that the state is free to regulate,'' he said.
   The ruling leaves states free to permit religious use of illegal
drugs.
   In fact, many states and the federal government already permit
use of peyote in religious ceremonies.
   In other rulings, the court:
   _Made it more difficult for employers to withdraw recognition of
a labor union representing striking workers after new employees are
hired to break the strike. The justices, voting 5-4 in a Texas
case, reinstated a National Labor Relations Board policy against
presuming the new employees oppose the union.
   _Ruled 9-0 in a case from Illinois that lawsuits charging
employers with violating a key federal anti-bias law may be filed
in state as well as federal courts.
   In the peyote case, Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote a stinging
dissent that said the court reduced religious freedom for Indians
to ``an unfulfilled and hollow promise.''
   Indians, who have endured a history of ``religious persecution
and intolerance,'' may have no choice but to move to a state that
permits them to practice their religion freely, he said.
   He was joined by Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood
Marshall.
   Tuesday's ruling overturned decisions by the Oregon Supreme
Court that said state officials may not deny benefits to the fired
workers, Galen W. Black and Alfred C. Smith.
   Both were counselors with the Douglas County, Ore., Council on
Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment. They were fired
after each took small amounts of peyote as part of a Native
American Church sacrament.

<HEAD>Keating Says He Could Prevent Taxpayer Bailout of S&amp;L</HEAD>

   Charles H. Keating Jr. says he could save the
taxpayers from losing any money if he regained control of his
failed Lincoln Savings and Loan Association from federal regulators.
   ``I think the bond holders would recover. The equity holders
would recover and the taxpayers would have no loss,'' Keating said
Tuesday in an emotional plea near the end of his seventh day on the
witness stand in his suit seeking to recover the Irvine, Calif.,
thrift institution.
   ``I think no one else could do a better job,'' he said, citing
reports that the losses of government-controlled thrifts are
mounting.
   However, U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin, who is hearing
Keating's suit, prodded him to admit that he had no more money to
protect the S&amp;L's depositors.
   ``I'm completely broke as is all my family. ... We have been
absolutely broken by this debacle,'' Keating acknowledged. At the
same time, he pledged to devote ``every ounce of energy'' and
``every asset I have'' to the task.
   The Treasury Department's Office of Thrift Supervision is asking
Sporkin to dismiss Keating's suit to overturn the April 1989
seizure of Lincoln.
   Regulators say Lincoln could become the nation's biggest thrift
failure with losses topping $2 billion. They have filed a $1.1
billion civil fraud suit against Keating and his associates.
   On Tuesday, Keating's attorneys introduced internal staff memos
to support their contention that the Federal Home Loan Bank Board,
the thrift office's predecessor, had no reason to seize Lincoln.
   After examining Lincoln, regulators concluded it fell $114
million short of its minimum capital requirement as of Sept. 30,
1988.
   Keating said Lincoln officials pointed out ``extremely
significant mathematical errors'' accounting for $100 million of
the shortfall, but regulators never responded.
   However, an internal memo introduced as evidence by Keating
indicates regulators were aware of one possible error that could
have thrown their calculations off by $60 million.
   Alvin W. Smuzynski, a senior bank board official, told Darrel
Dochow, then the chief supervisory official at the agency, in a
Feb. 17, 1989 memo, ``It now appears that the examiners did make a
significant, $60 million, error in their calculation.''
   ``I find this error, if verified, most distressing,'' Smuzynski
wrote.
   Kevin O'Connell, another senior bank board regulator, told
reporters after the testimony that Smuzynski's memo was the
agency's ``first blush'' reaction to Lincoln's claims and that it
never did agree that it had made an error.
   ``Note the hesitancy in the memo. The memo said `if verified.'
In fact, it was not verified,'' O'Connell said.
   Keating's attorneys introduced another internal memo from
Smuzynski to bolster their contention that the bank board unfairly
killed his attempts to sell Lincoln just before it was seized.
   Keating said bank board staff attached 21 conditions to the
sale, which were substantially accepted, but still rejected it.
   Smuzynski's March 30, 1989 memo to O'Connell said, ``We
sometimes play a game with recommendations _ you can deny a
recommendation by conditioning it to death. I think we should try
that.''
   Regulators have said they rejected the sales because they were
structured so Keating was, in effect, financing the sale and was
not giving up his interest in Lincoln.
   Keating complained that on the day of Lincoln's takeover, the
government sent ``squads of armed guards'' to the Phoenix
headquarters of the S&amp;L's parent company, American Continental Corp.
   They insulted employees and searched people leaving the
building, including a daughter-in-law who was nine months pregnant,
Keating said.
   Asked by the judge how regulators treated his customers, he
replied, ``Like dogs, dirt. Locked them out. Roughed them up.''
   Tuesday's testimony marked the 24th day of the hearing. Both
sides have finished presenting their main case. Sporkin said he
would give the government through Friday to cross-examine Keating
and present any rebuttal witnesses. The judge could eventually
decide to uphold the seizure, find it invalid or order a full trial
of the matter.

<HEAD>Bush Not Counting Thatcher Out Despite Low Standings in Polls</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush cautions against counting Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher out based on her low standing in British
opinion polls.
   Bush, in an interview with European and Canadian reporters, said
he hasn't ``given any thought'' to the possibility of having to
deal with Britain's opposition Labor Party.
   He shrugged off Mrs. Thatcher's low ratings, citing his own
underdog status in polls four months before a landslide election in
1988 and the recent errant surveys that forecast victory for
Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega in February.
   ``I'm enough of a politician to know that people can be down one
moment and then soaring like an eagle the next,'' said Bush, who
met with Mrs. Thatcher last Friday in Bermuda.
   Mrs. Thatcher, who begins her 12th year in office next month,
has seen her popularity plummet, partly due to an unpopular new
method of taxation.
   The White House on Tuesday released a transcript of the
interview Bush gave the reporters on Monday.
   On another issue, Bush said he is ``very happy'' with the custom
of keeping the supreme command of NATO in the hands of an American
general. It ``contributes to the view that we have an important
role to play'' in Europe, he said.
   Bush said he hopes his meeting with French President Francois
Mitterrand in Key Largo, Fla., on Thursday will ``narrow any
differences that might exist'' between France and the United States
on the future of NATO.
   Bush said there have been reports of ``a little drift and a
little separation'' between the two allies on NATO. ``The best way
to find that out is simply to sit and talk as we will do there,''
he said.
   ``It is my conviction that NATO will have a perhaps even more
important role to play in the stability of Europe,'' Bush said.
   Mitterrand's view ``doesn't exclude that, but (he) has a keen
interest in a role for CSCE,'' said Bush, referring to the
35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
spans both NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
   ``I don't think we're ... egregiously apart,'' Bush said.
   Asked if he could envision a French supreme commander of NATO,
Bush said, ``We're very happy with the present arrangements.''
   Although France belongs to the 16-nation alliance, it does not
participate in its integrated military structure.
   ``I don't want to have this coming out in a chauvinistic sense,
but I think the American people have to feel ... the American
presence is wanted'' in helping defend Europe, he said.
   Asked if the special U.S.-British relationship would endure
under a Labor government, Bush replied, ``I haven't given any
thought'' to dealing with Mrs. Thatcher's opposition.
   ``We do have a special relationship and it'll continue, I'm
sure,'' he said. But he voiced the hope of steering clear of ``the
bubbling cauldron of domestic politics inside the U.K.''
   ``I think at least in this country, people see (Mrs. Thatcher)
as a very courageous, principled leader who fights for her beliefs
and has survived many ups and downs,'' he said.
   On another issue, Bush said, ``I think it's premature for a
three-way free trade agreement'' among the United States, Canada
and Mexico. The United States and Canada already have an agreement.
   Bush said, ``the sensitivities on this question in Mexico are
such that we ought to let President (Carlos) Salinas set the pace
here.''
   Bush praised another ally, Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki
Kaifu, crediting his leadership with securing progress on long
smoldering trade disputes with the United States.

<HEAD>Foreign Minister: Brazil Will Not Sign Nuclear Arms Treaty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JORGE MEDEROS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brazil has no intention of building
nuclear weapons but it will not sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty because that would hurt the nation's advances in nuclear
technology, the foreign minister says.
   ``Brazil is a country without enemies that strongly rejects the
idea of building atomic weapons, but we will not sign the treaty
because we want to reach our objectives without foreign controls,''
Foreign Minister Francisco Rezek said Tuesday.
   Both Rezek and the nation's nuclear energy chief refused comment
on a report released Tuesday by the private Carnegie Foundation for
International Peace in Washington that Brazil and Argentina engaged
in smuggling to expand their nuclear weapons capabilities.
   International environmental and political groups have pressed
Brazil to sign the 1967 world nuclear treaty.
   A recent ministry statement, however, said the treaty is ``an
unjust instrument that intends to perpetuate two classes of nations
in the world ... those that can and cannot develop nuclear
programs.''
   Rezek said the new administration of President Fernando Collor
de Mello also rejects any form of foreign restrictions on Brazilian
installations for uranium enriching, considered a major step toward
building an atomic bomb.
   Jose Luiz de Carvalho Santana, the new president of the National
Commission of Nuclear Energy, also denied that Brazil would use
nuclear technology for military purposes.
   ``Never have we imagined building atomic bombs,'' Santana was
quoted as saying in an interview with the Folha de Sao Paulo
newspaper. ``The constitution prohibits nuclear activities for
non-peaceful ends, and that is why Brazil will never make an atomic
weapon.''
   Brazil has only one nuclear power plant on line, the Angra I
plant in Angra dos Reis, 100 miles southwest of Rio de Janeiro. The
plant was built by the Westinghouse Co.
   Santana said all Brazilian nuclear installations were under
international safeguards and would be open for periodic inspection
by the International Atomic Energy Agency, including the
controversial Aramar Nuclear Center.
   The center, kept secret until 1987, is run by the Navy Ministry
in Ipero, 75 miles west of Sao Paulo in southeastern Brazil. Two
years ago, the government enriched uranium at Atamar as part of a
program to build nuclear submarines.
   The annoucement by former President Jose Sarney that Brazilian
scientists had successfully developed fuel-cycle technology
prompted speculation that Brazil also wanted to build atomic
weapons.
   The Brazilian Society of Physics recently said the Aramar Center
is now capable of processing uranium for an atomic bomb, and it
warned in a report to Congress about increasing militarization of
the country's nuclear program.
   Physicist Luiz Pinguelli Rosa, the author of the report, said
the government was treating the nuclear program on military and
strategic merits, and not for scientific or energy purposes.
   ``It is worrisome to know that civil society has no type of
control over the parallel nuclear program developed by the armed
forces,'' Rosa wrote.
   In response, Santana told Folha da Sao Paulo that Brazil's
nuclear program was coordinated in part by civilians and that the
armed forces participated in the experiments as in any other
scientific sector.
   Santana said the Nuclear Commission was studying the possibility
of transferring uranium enrichment technology to the private sector
for commercial use.

<HEAD>Bush Adviser Says Soviets Would Stay Strong After START Treaty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union would have a completely
modern, formidable nuclear force even after carrying out cutbacks
under a START treaty with the United States, a senior adviser to
President Bush said today.
   The cutbacks, now being negotiated in Geneva, would trim the
size of the Soviet arsenal, Edward L. Rowny told the Reserve
Officers' Association.
   But, in the meantime, Rowny said in a prepared speech, Soviet
strategic forces _ long-range nuclear missiles, bombers and
submarines _ are being systematically upgraded to provide for a
powerful arsenal after the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty,
   The retired Army lieutenant general, who also served as an
adviser to President Reagan, added: ``The USSR is intent on
retaining its claim to the status of a superpower equal to the
United States that only first-rate nuclear forces can provide.''
   He said the Soviets were upgrading their strategic nuclear
weapons far more aggressively than the United States. For instance,
Rowny said, the Soviets are making their land-based SS-18
intercontinental ballistic missiles more accurate and more powerful
while continuing to deploy SS-24s with 10 warheads both in silos
and as mobile weapons.
   ``And the factory at Votkinsk continues to turn out the single
warhead SS-25 at a prodigious pace,'' he said. ``The force of
Soviet ballistic missile submarines and strategic bombers continues
to be modernized.''
   On the other hand, Rowny said, the United States is unable to
deploy the Peacekeeping ICBM on railroad cars, while the B-2 bomber
and development of a mobile ICBM ``are threatened by an untimely
tally of the peace divided.''
   Rowny's remarks seemed to be aimed at Congress, which is
reluctant to approve all the weapons requested by the Bush
administration while U.S.-Soviet tensions appear to be ebbing.
   ``I will be the first to acknowledge that in today's world, the
threat of war between the US and USSR has declined dramatically,''
Rowny said. ``But it has declined because America is strong, not
weak.''

<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. says it is cooperating
with an intensified federal investigation of faulty brakes in more
than 1 million GM large sedans, which consumers blame for 74
accident-related injuries.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety administration said Tuesday
it was upgrading the probe from a preliminary evaluation, which
involves paperwork, to an engineering analysis in which the
possibly defective parts are studied. The studies could lead to
recalls.
   The GM engineering analysis was announced by the agency in its
monthly report of auto defect investigations.
   The probe covers GM H-body cars, including the Pontiac
Bonneville, Buick LeSabre and Oldsmobile 88, manufactured in the
1986 through 1988 model years. An estimated 1.08 million are on the
road.
   There have been 892 complaints of brake problems, agency
spokesman Tim Hurd said. Of those, 187 have included reports of
accidents blamed on faulty brakes. Seventy-four injuries have been
reported.
   GM spokesman John Anderson said the company was cooperating with
the agency but that he could not comment further.
   In other new engineering analyses, the agency is examining:
   _70 reports of loose gear shift levers in 1986-87 Ford Rangers
with manual transmissions. An estimated 399,000 of the pickup
trucks are on the road.
   _109 complaints of gasoline leaks in GM's C and K model trucks
from the 1984 through 1986 model years. An estimated 1.6 million
are on the road.
   _Seat belt cuts in the 1990 Chevrolet Lumina. The probe was
begun as a preliminary evaluation after a seat belt was cut during
a routine agency crash test, but discontinued when no evidence of
safety defect was found.
   It is being reopened because Indiana state police reported a cut
seat belt in an accident involving a 1990 Lumina, Hurd said.

   A 10-month-old boy orphaned when his
parents died in the quake-triggered collapse of Interstate 880 was
placed permanently with his mother's cousin Tuesday, peacefully
ending a family feud over him and his sizeable estate.
   Alameda County Superior Court Judge Roderick Duncan said James
Henry Brown IV will live with Arthur and Tonia Lewis on their
50-acre hog and cattle ranch near Chowchilla, about 120 miles
southeast of San Francisco.
   Attorney Simone Campbell, appointed by the court to represent
the child's interests, said she was delighted the matter was
resolved.
   Brown's mother, 18-year-old Michele Richard, and his father,
James Brown III, died on the Oakland freeway Oct. 17 while en route
to a Berkeley fishing pier.
   Since then the boy has lived alternately with both maternal and
paternal grandparents, all of whom asked the court to award them
custody. ``In their heart of hearts, they all wanted Jimmy,''
Campbell said.
   For about the past month, the boy has lived with the Lewises.
   Alameda County's Public Guardian's Office already has been
designated to oversee the boy's estate. He is to receive $100,000
in damages for his parents' deaths, but the settlement is likely to
reach close to $1 million by the time the issue is finally resolved.
   Before Tuesday's hearing, the grandparents and the Lewises met
alone and agreed to a visitation schedule, Duncan said.
   The judge said he hoped the case serves as an example to others
in similar legal battles ``in which the children are always the
victims.''
   James' new family is due back in court for a progress report
Sept. 18.

<HEAD>Three Networks Get Lowest Ratings in History</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The good news for NBC: It won its fifth
consecutive season in the prime-time ratings. The bad news: It did
it with the lowest ratings in history.
   The season-ending arithmetic indicated cable TV is continuing to
make inroads against the three major networks' audience shares. Ten
years ago, they had 90 percent of the audience; in the latest
count, they're down to 65 percent.
   Network officials differed Tuesday on whether cable and Fox
Broadcasting, or Nielsen's methods of estimating audience size,
caused the drop.
   ``The primary cause of that (drop) is probably basic cable, with
a little bit of Fox on the three nights that they're on the air,''
NBC research vice president Robert Niles said.
   David Poltrack and Larry Hyams, research executives at CBS and
ABC, respectively, said TV viewing generally is down, not just at
the major networks, and that the drop may result from methodology,
not competition.
   Citing declines in daytime viewing that he called unprecedented,
Poltrack conceded that ``at this point we have no answer'' on the
cause of the drop either in daytime or at night.
   But ``the largest amount of that loss is from a decline in homes
using television,'' not from cable and other forms of competition,
said Poltrack.
   He said CBS has asked Nielsen for a check of its methods of
audience measurement, which include instant-data ``peoplemeters''
in 4,000 homes, and diaries that viewers must fill in.
   Second-place ABC, whose recent ``Twin Peaks'' series has gotten
respectable ratings, gained more viewers last season, even though
its share of the TV audience remained flat.
   The A.C. Nielsen Co. each year reports a larger number of homes
with TV. Last year, a ratings point represented 904,000 homes. This
year, the number was up to 921,000, which meant ABC's audience
increased by more than 200,000 homes.
   CBS finished in third place for the third year with its worst
ratings ever.
   In the 30-week season that ended Sunday, ABC averaged a 12.9,
the same as in 1988-89. CBS averaged a 12.2, down 4 percent. NBC
had a 14.6 _ 9 percent below last season.
   NBC officials noted that NBC's ratings last season had the added
boost of telecasts of the Summer Olympics, the World Series and the
Super Bowl.
   Only Fox Broadcasting, which doesn't yet consider itself a
network and only has three nights of regular programs, showed a
ratings rise.
   Boosted by its midseason cartoon hit, ``The Simpsons,'' it had a
6.5 rating, up from last season's 5.3 average for two nights of
shows, according to Fox estimates.
   ``America's Funniest Home Videos'' on ABC was the season's
top-rated new series, coming in fifth overall.
   Of the midseason shows besides ``Twin Peaks,'' NBC's new ``Carol
&amp; Company,'' starring Carol Burnett, has shown ratings promise. It
has won its time period in all three of its Saturday broadcasts to
date.

<TEXT>
   The long road to a seat in a freely
elected Hungarian Parliament was rutted with prison, the threat of
the gallows and self-exile for Bela Kiraly, who led freedom
fighters against Soviet tanks in 1956.
   For the 78-year-old Kiraly, victory at the polls on April 8
capped a perilous journey that saw him change continents and
professions three times.
   The ramrod career army officer fled after the failed 1956 revolt
and began a new life in the United States as a history professor.
He returned last year to help cement democracy in his homeland and
plans to sell his home in Highland Lakes, N.J.
   ``My life moves like a sinus curve _ up and down,'' said a
reflective Kiraly. ``The old soldier never dies, he just fades
away, but he always has a last hurrah. This is my last hurrah.''
   While he had been prepared to live out his life in the United
States, Kiraly always considered himself a Hungarian.
   ``The fact that I came back and among the circumstances that I
did somehow just makes my whole justified,'' Kiraly said. ``The
predominant sentiment in my heart is, `I'm proud to be Hungarian.'''
   Thirty-four years ago, when Kiraly slipped into Austria, the
revolution had failed and the Soviets were hot on his trail. There
was no thought of returning.
   The former brigadier general had spent years on death row for
treason before Communist leaders paroled him and others as part of
a futile attempt to defuse growing popular outrage. He joined the
revolt shortly after it broke out Oct. 23, 1956.
   As the head of the National Guard of freedom fighters, Kiraly
was high on the list of men wanted by the post-revolutionary
Hungarian government. Staying would have meant the gallows, as it
did for Premier Imre Nagy, Defense Minister Pal Maleter and other
leaders of the uprising.
   Their execution in 1958 shocked the Western world. Kiraly then
made a vow that seemed to make his exile permanent.
   ``I set the precondition not to cross the frontier of this state
until and unless my friends, who became martyrs, received the
proper acknowledgement and honor in Hungary.''
   Kiraly was invited back to Hungary on June 17 to speak at a
reburial ceremony for his friends.
   The Hungarian Communist leadership had been the only one in
Eastern Europe to reject its monopoly on power without massive
popular pressure.
   In the process, it embraced the 1956 revolution as legitimate,
rehabilitated the leaders of the uprising and moved their remains
from weed-rankled unmarked plots to proper graves.
   As ranking Communist officials stood with heads bowed, Kiraly
invoked Hungary's ``glorious day.'' Hundreds of thousands listened
to his words, some sobbing in catharsis.
   For Kiraly, it ranked as one of the most memorable moments in a
remarkable life, along with his election to Parliament in his home
town of Kaposvar, about 90 miles southwest of Budapest.
   But not all the good times were in Hungary.
   Kiraly said he felt an near-unparalled sense of accomplishment
in 1964 when the students of the City University of New York
elected him teacher of the year. He speaks glowingly of the United
States.
   ``It was a very generous land. I never felt any sense of
confrontation there between being a decent American citizen and
remaining a Hungarian,'' he said. ``America will never be a closed
book for me.''
   Kiraly's most vivid memories are still firmly rooted in 1956
Hungary, and his face assumes a faraway look as he talks about the
heady days of near victory and the despair of defeat and self-exile.
   ``Nothing compares to the election as head of the freedom
fighter forces,'' he said. ``And those days will remain indelibly
etched in my mind forever.''

   The Rev. Ralph David Abernathy, who shared 17
jail cells with Martin Luther King Jr., marched with him in Selma,
cradled his bloody head in Memphis and broke with his followers
over a tell-all memoir, is dead at 64.
   Abernathy died Tuesday at Crawford Long Hospital while being
prepared for a lung scan to locate a suspected blood clot, hospital
spokeswoman Tisha Burland said. The cause of death was not
immediately known.
   As King's chief lieutenant, Abernathy was at his side at almost
every key battle of the civil rights movement of the 1950s and '60s
and took his place as leader of the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference after King's 1968 assassination. But the fame and
adulation enjoyed by King never quite extended to Abernathy.
   In a 1986 interview, he lamented that during a visit to a school
in Connecticut, ``not a single student knew who I was.''
   In 1989 he was reviled as a traitor to the cause for writing
about King's alleged marital infidelity in his autobiography, ``And
The Walls Came Tumbling Down.'' Abernathy wrote that King spent
time with two women and had a violent argument with one in the 24
hours before his assassination.
   King's widow, Coretta Scott King, was among those who praised
Abernathy on Tuesday. She issued a statement from Zimbabwe, where
she was attending celebrations of that country's 10th anniversary
of independence.
   ``When our home was bombed and our lives were threatened, he was
there,'' she said. ``His strength as a tactician and a counselor to
Martin during our struggle has been eloquently recorded in Martin's
own writings and in the annals of the American civil rights
movement.''
   King's son, Fulton County Commissioner Martin Luther King III,
called Abernathy's death ``a very tragic loss to our nation.''
   President Bush hailed Abernathy as ``a great leader in the
struggle for civil rights for all Americans and a tireless
campaigner for justice.''
   The Rev. Joseph Lowery, who succeeded Abernathy as president of
the SCLC, described Abernathy on Tuesday as ``a faithful servant of
the cause of liberty and justice.''
   Abernathy had been in the hospital since March 23 for treatment
of a sodium deficiency and had suffered strokes in 1983 and 1986.
At the time of his death he was pastor of West Hunter Street
Baptist Church.
   Born in Linden, Ala., the son of a farmer, Abernathy joined with
King in 1955 to lead the Montgomery, Ala., bus boycott that lifted
King to national fame. For the next 13 years King and Abernathy
were virtually inseparable.
   ``We were known as the civil rights twins,'' Abernathy once
recalled. ``We always sought to complement each other. I never
tried to be a copy of him and he never tried to be a copy of me.''
   They co-founded the SCLC in 1957, and Abernathy was in a nearby
cell when King wrote his famous ``Letter from the Birmingham Jail''
in 1963, setting forth the goals of their movement.
   Later that year, Abernathy was at King's side for the ``I Have a
Dream'' speech that climaxed the march on Washington, the biggest
demonstration in U.S. history. He was in Sweden when King received
the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, and the two led the
Selma-to-Montgomery march for voting rights in 1965.
   And on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tenn., Abernathy took King's
bloody head in his hands moments after an assassin's bullet cut him
down.
   But in his autobiography, Abernathy said he felt other King
aides saw him as ``no more than an appendage to Martin ... who
never played an important role.''
   King had directed that Abernathy succeed him at the SCLC despite
Abernathy's reluctance. Abernathy led the 1968 Poor People's
Campaign that brought thousands to Washington. But the SCLC lost
its leadership role in the civil rights movement as key aides such
as Andrew Young and Jesse Jackson left to follow their own paths.
   Abernathy stepped down from the SCLC leadership in 1977 and
slipped back into King's shadow while other black leaders stepped
to the fore. In 1986 he was excluded from a planning group for the
first Martin Luther King Jr. national holiday.
   After publication of his autobiography, Abernathy was criticized
in a statement signed by 28 prominent blacks, including Young,
Jackson, Lowery and Benjamin Hooks, executive director of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. His
alma mater, Alabama State University, rescinded its decision to
name a dormitory after Abernathy.
   His friend Hosea Williams branded Abernathy a ``Judas.''
   On Tuesday, Williams called him ``one of the truest human rights
leaders America has ever produced.''
   ``By giving unselfish leadership and through suffering and
sacrificing, Dr. Abernathy has earned the second most important
place in history,'' Williams said.
   Abernathy's survivor's include his wife, Juanita; two sons,
Kwame and state Rep. Ralph David Abernathy III; and two daughters,
Juandalynn and Donzaleigh.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

   ``Roseanne'' was the No. 1 show last week and
for the 1989-90 season, dethroning ``The Cosby Show'' after a
four-year reign.
   The comedy starring Roseanne Barr as a wisecracking mother
helped boost ABC into a first-place tie with NBC for the week.
   NBC still finished as the top-rated network for the fifth
straight season, but hits such as ``Roseanne'' and ``America's
Funniest Home Videos'' have pushed ABC ever closer to breaking
NBC's grip on the No. 1 position.
   ABC and NBC each received an 11.9 average for the week ended
April 15. CBS lagged with an 11. Each ratings point represents
921,000 homes.
   For the season, NBC was No. 1 with a 14.6 average, followed by
ABC with 12.9 and CBS with 12.2, according NBC figures.
   ``Roseanne'' had a season average 23.4 rating and ``Cosby'' a
23.1, according to figures released Tuesday by the A.C. Nielsen Co.
``Cosby,'' starring Bill Cosby as a good-natured father, had been
No. 1 for four seasons.
   The season-ending analyses produced an odd debate over whether
``Roseanne'' was the season's top-rated show. David Poltrack, a
research expert at CBS, denied that ``The Cosby Show'' had been
bested by ``Roseanne.''
   He included in his ratings average a special Sunday broadcast of
``Roseanne'' that he said had dragged the show's total ratings
down. ``Roseanne'' is regularly broadcast Tuesday nights.
   By his reckoning, the NBC and ABC shows had identical ratings of
23.1. But he said Cosby won with an average 38 percent audience
share, compared with a 35 percent average for Roseanne Barr's
series.
   After much hoopla and initial high ratings, ABC's new nighttime
soap opera `Twin Peaks'' dropped to 13th place last week with a
16.2 average after ranking fifth for its two-hour premiere April 8.
   For the first time in its history, the alternative Fox network
landed three programs in the top 30. ``The Simpsons'' placed 16th;
``Married ... With Children'' ranked 18th, and the debut of ``In
Living Color,'' a black version of ``Saturday Night Live,'' was
29th. All three shows air on Sunday night.
   Here are the top 10 shows, their network and rating:
``Roseanne,'' ABC, 22.1; ``Cheers,'' NBC, 19.7; ``America's
Funniest Home Videos,'' ABC, 18.8; ``The Cosby Show,'' NBC, 18.6;
``Coach,'' ABC, 17.8; ``A Different World,'' NBC, 17.7; ``Cheers''
special repeat, NBC, 17.6; ``Golden Girls,'' NBC, 17.3; ``Empty
Nest,'' NBC, 17.2; and ``Unsolved Mysteries,'' NBC, 17.1.
   ABC's ``World News Tonight with Peter Jennings'' held onto the
No. 1 network news spot with a 9.8 average. CBS and Dan Rather
finished second with 8.6 and NBC's Tom Brokaw was third with 8.3.

   In a settlement of a federal regulators'
allegations, Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. has
agreed to pay $5.6 million to customers for stock sold in partial
tender offers without prior client approval.
   The New York-based securities firm and a managing director,
Michael Dreitlein, agreed to settle _ without admitting or denying
wrongdoing _ an administrative action alleging they violated
Securities and Exchange Commission anti-fraud and record-keeping
rules.
   The action, announced Tuesday in Washington, was brought by the
SEC's New York Regional Office. Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette's
Pershing Division was making $4.3 million in tender offer profits
from the ``unauthorized and undisclosed'' sale of shares from
customer accounts between January 1982 and April 1988.
   A tender offer is an offer to buy a corporation's shares _ often
as a means of acquiring the concern _ usually at a premium price.

   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A District of Columbia judge has dismissed a
lawsuit against Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., alleging that Frank's
relationship with a male prostitute constituted a public nuisance.
   The suit alleged that Frank was aware his Capitol Hill apartment
was being used by Stephen Gobie for his prostitution business.
   Superior Court Judge Harold Cushenberry dismissed the suit on
the grounds that the plaintiffs had no right to bring it and that
any alleged nuisance was clearly not continuing.
   The one-page decision, dated April 10, was released by Frank's
office Tuesday as Frank, in Boston, was announcing his candidacy
for a sixth term.
   The suit was filed two ministers of Washington churches and
financially backed by the Conservative Caucus, which has long
opposed many of Frank's liberal views.
   In his one-page order, Cushenberry wrote that he ``concluded
that an ongoing statutory violation is required'' to seek an
injunction against Frank blocking the alleged nuisance and that the
plaintiffs ``have failed to allege the `special damage' that must
be pleaded in order for a private party to prosecute a public
nuisance claim.''

<HEAD>Maker of ``Boo Pumpkin'' Recalls Potentially Hazardous Toy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The manufacturer of a Halloween toy cited for
potential hazards by a consumer group is recalling the novelty
items.
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission said Tuesday that Rhode
Island-based Easy Aces, Inc. recalled 40,000 of its ``Boo Pumpkin''
toys because parts can break off ``and pose a fatal choking hazard
to yung children.''
   The two-inch, pumpkin-shaped toys were sold nationwide between
August and November 1989. When the pumpkin is squeezed a latex
balloon shaped like a ghost pops out and a squeaker sounds.
   Consumers should return the toys to the stores where purchased
for a full refund, the commission said.

   Forces bent on ending Moscow's reign as the
capital of communism have taken over the city council and want to
start by removing the giant bust of Lenin from their meeting hall.
   There's certain to be a fight over whether the plaster bust will
stay or go, and some wonder if, with all the procedural wrangling,
the newly elected council's majority will be able to carry out any
of its goals.
   Members did agree on one thing Tuesday: to remove the fancy
sturgeon from the buffet at the House of Political Enlightenment,
where their sessions are held. The Russian delicacy is unavailable
to the ordinary consumer, and deputies decided it would be
unsuitable to feast on it themselves.
   The key figure in the economic revolution brewing in this city
of 9 million is Gavriil Popov, an outspoken economist and lawmaker
whom the council was expected to elect mayor today.
   Popov, rotund and steely haired, has pushed for free-market
reforms to replace central planning. He was always in the minority,
until the Democratic Russia bloc took control of more than 60
percent of the 495 council seats in March balloting.
   ``We'll be trying to bring in a program of the privatization of
the economy,'' said Lev Balashov, a member of the bloc.
   Popov refused to be interviewed during a break in Tuesday's
session, but his bloc's plans are laid out in Kommersant, a new
business newspaper with a capitalistic slant.
   It said that under Popov's administration Moscow's reforms would
far outpace the country as a whole, and the city would ``become a
testing zone for economic reform'' nationwide.
   The newspaper said the Democratic Russia bloc wants changes that
would create a virtual free market in agricultural produce and
remove private businesses known as cooperatives from a tangle of
regulations.
   It also wants incentives to attract foreign capital, including
easing rules on long-term leasing of buildings and allowing firms
to pay in part with services to ease city problems.
   There has been no Kremlin reaction to the proposals. The city is
largely independent when it comes to funding.
   Radicals are banking on being able to do more to change the
economy, however. They say President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who
began instituting reform after coming to power in 1985,
increasingly supports a market economy.
   Moscow clearly needs help, as Pravda reported Tuesday: ``Public
transport works badly, the housing program is on the point of
breaking down, the health system is in a depressing state, the list
of food and goods shortages is lengthening, the ecology is getting
worse, financial prospects are unclear and the crime rate is
growing.''
   But the new city council's first session, which began Monday,
raised doubts about how effective it would be.
   Legislators bogged down for hours in procedural wrangles typical
of Soviet bloc parliaments.
   ``Most of these people are activists,'' said Boris Kagarlitsky,
a sociologist and member of the Democratic Russia bloc. ``They
can't tell the difference between a public rally and a council
session.''
   With such inefficiency, ``the prospect for Moscow is a
disaster,'' Kagarlitsky said. ``There are two possible outcomes _
either chaos or catastrophe within six months.
   ``They'll have problems with electricity, with food shortages,
and probably the city can go bankrupt.''
   Members of Moskva, or Moscow bloc, which includes 95 council
deputies who basically follow the Communist Party line, also
predict that the city is doomed under the radicals.
   Vladimir Gruzdev of Moskva said many feared the city would
return to ``early, uncontrolled capitalism,'' and lose the social
guarantees of communism.
   Members of Democratic Russia and Moskva disagree on just about
everything, and Moskva deputies have repeatedly walked out of the
hall in protest.
   However, they have agreed _ for now _ to leave the bust of Lenin
scowling over the proceedings.
   Balashov said he was sure it would be gone by this time next
year.

<TEXT>
   Art Wilmer and his family lived in a
quiet mountain cabin near Yellowstone National Park _ until a
750-person bomb shelter was erected nearby.
   ``This winter we'd go out in the middle of the night and hear
the roar of the diesel engines,'' he said Tuesday. ``It's like
living next to an industrial park.''
   The engines belonged to the Church Universal and Triumphant, a
religious group building a giant, underground fallout-shelter
complex in a high mountain meadow north of Gardiner to prepare for
the possibility of global catastrophe.
   Residents of the Yellowstone gateway community, ringed by
10,000-foot mountain peaks, have eyed the church with curiosity and
suspicion since it bought a 12,500-acre ranch from the late
millionaire publisher Malcolm Forbes in 1981.
   That suspicion has turned to anger with construction of the
church's complex and last week's news that more than 30,000 gallons
of gasoline and diesel fuel have leaked from underground tanks near
the fallout shelter.
   ``People are getting tired of what the church has been doing,''
said Wayne Hoppe, who lives east of Gardiner, which has a permanent
population of about 600. ``They're just literally tearing this
country to pieces.''
   State health officials in Helena said Tuesday they would seek a
court order stopping construction of the church complex just north
of the park.
   Church spokesman Murray Steinman responded, ``We believe that
we've done everything that we were asked by the state to do and we
will continue to do it. Our essential message is we're going to
cooperate, cooperate, cooperate.''
   After buying the Forbes ranch, church officials said they had no
plans for extensive development. The church has since bought 18,000
more acres, moved its headquarters here from Southern California
and sponsored several housing developments.
   Hundreds of followers have moved into the area, and many have
built fallout shelters at housing developments near Emigrant, a
ranching community 30 miles north of Gardiner.
   The church is led by Elizabeth Clare Prophet, who claims she
receives and passes on to members messages from a group of souls
known as the Ascended Masters. She warned her followers that March
and April would be dangerous times.
   Gardiner residents accused the church of lying about its
development plans, which many see as a threat to the environment.
   ``Their religion doesn't matter; they can howl at the moon for
all I care,'' said Bill Hoppe, Wayne Hoppe's son and an outfitter.
``I'm not against them living in Park County. But, by God, they've
got to be truthful. They haven't said one truthful thing for nine
years.''
   Steinman said church officials have ``communicated what we were
doing when we knew what we were doing. I don't want (residents) to
get the idea that we don't care.''
   Wilmer said he and his family recently moved from their cabin
into Gardiner because of constant traffic on the narrow, twisting
dirt road leading to the fallout shelter.
   ``We just decided, `Hey, this is too much stress,' so we moved
out,'' he said. ``It was like a frenzy. My wife almost had a
head-on with some big trucks.''
   Hoppe and others also accused the state of failing to
aggressively regulate church developments. ``I think the church is
laughing at the people of Montana and the people of Park County and
our governor,'' he said.
   Local officials estimate 2,000 to 3,000 church members live in
the valley.
   ``A lot of people used to say, `Hey, we're doing our thing, let
them do theirs,''' Wilmer said. ``Now, they're realizing that
exercising its freedom is going to take away ours.''

   A suspended Hispanic policeman convicted of
manslaughter in the deaths of two black men was listed in stable
condition today after a reported suicide attempt.
   William Lozano, 30, was rushed to Coral Reef Hospital on Tuesday
night, said hospital President Kenneth Sample. Hospital officials
refused to give further details beyond the condition officer's
condition.
   The emergency call came in to police as an attempted suicide,
but it was unclear what was wrong with Lozano, Metro-Dade police
spokeswoman Myriam Royle said. Police and rescue units who went to
his home found him awake, she said.
   Lozano in January 1989 fatally shot an unarmed motorcyclist
fleeing from police. The biker's passenger died in the resulting
crash, and the deaths touched off three days of rioting in Miami's
black neighborhoods.
   The Miami police officer testified he thought the motorcyclist
was trying to run him down. Lozano was convicted and sentenced in
January to seven years in prison but is free on bail while on
appeal.
   The officer's mother; older brother, also a Miami police
officer; and former partner were at the hospital, but the family
refused to comment.

<HEAD>Nikkei Surges, Dollar Rises Marginally</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices soared on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
Wednesday, while the dollar rose marginally against the yen.
   The dollar ended trading at 159.87 yen, up 0.04 yen from
Tuesday's close of 159.83 yen. It opened higher at 160.13 yen and
ranged between 159.80 yen and 160.18 yen.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average rose 787.46 points, or 2.77
percent, ending the day at 29,249.06 in the market's ninth-largest
single-day increase. The Nikkei had slipped a marginal 1.58 points
on Tuesday.
   Traders said the index surged in the afternoon because many
market players shared the view that both stock prices and the yen
had bottomed out.
   ``As the yen weakened below the 160-yen level, which many
investors had feared, they felt the market had gotten over one
negative element and started buying,'' said Takahiro Kishishita, a
trader with Nippon Kangyo Kakumaru Securities Co.
   As long as the yen stays around 160, the stock market will
remain stable, Kishishita said.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's strength followed its upswing
in New York Tuesday. The rise was spurred by the release of data
showing continued strength in the U.S. economy, including a 0.7
percent rise in industrial production in March, they said.
   Expectations that February trade figures due out later Wednesday
in Washington would show a dramatic improvement over January's $9.3
billion deficit also supported the dollar, dealers said.
   ``Many investors have been buying the dollar based on an
expectation of smaller U.S. trade deficit,'' said Koichiro Amaya, a
dealer with Chemical Bank in Tokyo.
   But Amaya said the dollar will continue to move narrowly around
the 160-yen level because some investors, who have already
overbought the dollar, are selling the U.S. currency whenever it
nears 160.20 yen.
   In the bond market, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bond slipped to 85.76 points late in the

<HEAD>Scientists Claim to Find Gene Linked to Alcoholism</HEAD>

   A claim by scientists to have found a gene that
may make people prone to alcoholism should be regarded with extreme
caution, says a leading researcher.
   Dr. Henry Begleiter of the State University of New York Health
Science Center said such research is usually done on living members
of the same family, not cadavers, as was done in the study in
today's Journal of the American Medical Association.
   ``I would be _ at the very, very least _ extremely cautious ...
to report that the gene had been identified,'' said Begleiter, who
is studying 800 families in the nation's largest research project
on the role of heredity in alcoholism.
   In the new study, scientists reported finding a particular gene
on a chromosome previously linked with alcoholism to be far more
common in alcoholics than non-alcoholics.
   If verified, the finding would represent the first specific
identification of a genetic root for alcoholism and would give
added weight to the argument that alcoholism is a disease and not a
moral weakness.
   Alcoholism afflicts about 18 million Americans and tends to run
in families. Environment also has been implicated as a contributing
factor.
   Scientists exploring possible genetic factors have named three
of the body's 46 chromosomes as possibly playing a role. But no one
previously isolated one of the 100,000 genes on those chromosomes
as likely culprits.
   The gene pinpointed in the new study has two forms, each of
which governs formation of a nerve cell called the dopamine D2
receptor, believed to play a key role in experiencing pleasure.
   The researchers looked at both forms of the gene _ the ``A-1
allele'' and the ``A-2 allele'' _ in brain tissue from the cadavers
of 70 subjects, 35 alcoholics and 35 non-alcoholics.
   ``We found a very high association of the A-1 allele with
alcoholism and a very high association of the A-2 allele with
non-alcoholism,'' said Dr. Ernest P. Noble, the study's co-leader
and director of the Alcohol Research Center at the University of
California, Los Angeles.
   The A-1 allele was present in 69 percent of the alcoholics and
in 20 percent of non-alcoholics, the researchers reported. Such a
high correlation was surprising, given that alcoholism comes in a
number of forms and is almost certain to have a number of causes,
they said.
   ``We really can't say that indeed we found the alcholism gene
per se,'' said Kenneth Blum, the study's co-leader and chief of the
Addictive Diseases division in the Department of Pharmacology at
the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio.
   But, he added in an interview Tuesday, ``We think that in the
age-old question of nature vs. nurture, this finding has added to
the nature side, to the disease concept, rather than (to the
concept that alcoholism) is just moral weakness or willful
misconduct.''
   Scientists at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and
Alcoholism, of which Noble is former director, wrote in an
accompanying editorial that the study is ``provocative and
promising but must be regarded with caution.''
   Reasons for caution include a lack of complete information on
the subjects' medical histories and uncertainty over whether
genetic differences between the groups are linked to traits
unrelated to alcoholism, they said.

   American Indian peyote-eaters say ritual
use of the psychedelic cactus is unlikely to stop despite a U.S.
Supreme Court ruling that religious beliefs are no excuse for using
illegal drugs.
   The court Tuesday upheld the decision of Oregon officials who
denied unemployment benefits to two drug counselors fired for
eating peyote as part of their religious practices.
   Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the court's 6-3 majority,
said it ``would be courting anarchy'' to let a few do what is
illegal for everyone else.
   Dissenting justices said the ruling permits religious oppression
of Indians, a view supported by American Indian spiritual leaders.
   ``We have been doing this all these years before the
Constitution was here. I don't see why we can't continue,'' said
Emerson Jackson, president of the Native American Church of North
America. The umbrella group claims at least 250,000 members
belonging to 70 church chapters that practice the peyote ritual in
23 Western states.
   The Oregon drug counselors, Galen W. Black and Alfred C. Smith,
were fired after breaking a policy of ADAPT, the non-profit
rehabilitation organization they worked for in Douglas County,
Ore., by eating small amounts of peyote as part of a Native
American Church sacrament. Smith is an American Indian; Black is
not, but belongs to the church.
   The two were fired in 1983-84 and denied unemployment benefits.
They did not use peyote on the job.
   Oregon officials see the case as a drug-abuse issue.
   ``We have always insisted the state is not required to pay
people for using illegal substances no matter what their religious
beliefs might be,'' said Oregon Attorney General Dave Frohnmayer.
``The court said our law does not discriminate against religions.''
   But defenders of peyote rituals see the case as a clash of
cultures.
   ``The Native American Church is the most persecuted bona fide
religion in the United States,'' said Steven Moore, attorney for
the Native American Rights Fund in Boulder, Colo. ``The irony is
that it's one of the first. It's been here for 10,000 years.''
   The small, button-shaped cactus contains mescaline, a mild
hallucinogen. It grows mainly in the deserts of Mexico and southern
Texas.
   Archaelogical evidence indicates the plant was used by Indians
10,000 years ago, said Omer Stewart, a retired University of
Colorado anthropologist and author of the book ``Peyote Religion.''
   Today, the psychedelic cactus is dried into chewy strips, ground
into powder or made into a bitter tea. It's not likely to attract a
wide following of casual users, said Stewart, who has studied the
ritual use of peyote since 1937.
   Jackson, a Navajo ``peyote priest'' from Window Rock, Ariz.,
calls the peyote-induced hallucinations ``teachings'' from the Holy
Spirit. He likens peyote to the sacramental wine used in Roman
Catholic communion, ``except that alcohol is habit-forming and
peyote is not.''
   He travels around the West as a ``road man,'' administering
peyote in fireside rituals of chanting and drumming that last all
night.
   The rituals build cultural ties and reduce the alcoholism that
plagues Indian reservations, said Ralph Metzner, academic vice
president of the California Institute of Integral Studies in San
Francisco and author of ``The Psychedelic Experience.''
   Peyote also serves healing and psychotherapeutic roles, Metzner
said. ``In our more segmented approach, we have doctors, counselors
and priests. They have peyote.''
   Congress repeatedly rejected attempts to ban the ritual use of
peyote.
   Jackson is confident that peyote use will continue. His concern
for now is finding enough peyote, which the church buys in Texas
from dealers regulated by state and federal governments.
   ``We're getting more members,'' Jackson said, ``and the supplies
are going down.''

   Massachusetts' Supreme Court overruled a judge and
ordered jury selection open to the public today in the case of a
Christian Science couple charged with manslaughter for not seeking
medical care for their son.
   Superior Court Judge Sandra Hamlin on Tuesday had ordered jury
selection closed on the grounds publicity would have a ``chilling
effect'' on prospective jurors.
   But Supreme Court Associate Justice Neil L. Lynch overruled him
on a challenge by The Boston Globe.
   David and Ginger Twitchell are charged with manslaughter for
relying on faith instead of medicine to heal their 2{-year-old son,
Robyn, who died in 1986 of a bowel obstruction.
   Prosecutors argued that the child's life could have been saved
if he had received conventional medical treatment.
   Defense attorney Rikki Klieman contended that the Twitchells,
far from acting recklessly, sought the only real cure dictated by
their beliefs.
   Founded in 1879 by Mary Baker Eddy, the Church of Christ,
Science, believes that disease, like sin, can be healed by
spiritual means alone. The case is being closely watched by the
church, which contends its doctrine is under attack.
   The U.S. Supreme Court typically has refused to hear such cases,
and there has been little consensus in similar cases heard around
the country.

   Contra rebel leaders have softened
demands the Sandinista army be dismantled before they disband, but
it remains unclear whether agreement can be reached by the time the
new government takes office.
   A top aide to President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro said
after talks late Tuesday involving the Contras and the Sandinistas
that the possibility of Nicaraguans finally living in peace is
``enormous.''
   The Sandinistas, defeated at the polls in February, had
predicted a fresh outbreak of fighting unless the thousands of
Contra fighters who have since flooded into the country from
Honduras lay down their arms.
   Sandinista and UNO negotiators said they expected to sign a
cease-fire agreement with the Contras today.
   Contra negotiators did not comment after leaving the talks,
which focused on who should hold arms when her United National
Opposition coalition (UNO) takes office a week from today.
   The rebel delegation arrived for talks Tuesday saying the
Contras would not lay down their arms until the military _ built
and dominated by the Sandinistas during their decade in power _ is
dismantled and replaced by a police force.
   The Contras have said Nicaragua should follow the example of
Costa Rica, a stable democracy that dismantled its army in 1948.
   But after the 6{-hour meeting, the rebel delegation appeared
flexible.
   Chief Contra negotiator Oscar Sovalbarro said demands that the
Sandinistas disarm ``are aspects that must be negotiated.''
   Maj. Gen. Joaquin Cuadra, deputy defense minister and chief of
staff of the Sandinista army, said that ``with political will,''
the Contras could be dismantled by the time Mrs. Chamorro takes
office.
   But UNO negotiator Leopoldo Navarro said the participants would
have to be flexible about the April 25 deadline demanded by the
Sandinistas.
   Early in the day, the Sandinista press had expressed concern
that a new round of war could break out.
   It quoted the general secretary of the Sandinista Labor
Federation as saying Sandinista workers would seize ``strategic
points'' in Managua if the Contras refuse to disarm. The union
claims 100,000 members.
   One pro-Sandinista daily, El Nuevo Diario, said in a front-page
headline: ``Either the Contras Demobilize before the 25th or a
General Strike Explodes.''
   But after the meeting Antonio Lacayo, Mrs. Chamorro's son-in-law
and a leading aide, struck an optimistic tone: ``There are enormous
possibilities of assuring peace in Nicaragua.''
   The negotiations were the first involving UNO, the Contras and
the Sandinistas since Mrs. Chamorro's 14-party coalition defeated
the Sandinistas in Feb. 25 elections.
   Mrs. Chamorro will take office for six years and her
administration is counting on a peaceful Nicaragua to deliver on
her key campaign promise of reviving the economy.
   Under a protocol agreement signed by UNO and the administration
of outgoing President Daniel Ortega, Mrs. Chamorro pledged to
respect the army's ``professionalism'' but said officers would be
barred from serving as political party leaders, as is now the case.
   Both Ortega and Mrs. Chamorro have called on the Contras to
disband. The Contras and UNO signed an agreement on March 23 for
the Contras to disarm but set no firm date.
   A UNO spokesman, Luis Sanchez, said the Contra demand to cull
the army of Sandinista officers had not been discussed Tuesday and
there were no plans to take up the issue.
   La Prensa, the newspaper owned by Mrs. Chamorro's family,
reported Tuesday that Bernard Aronson, the assistant U.S. secretary
of state for the region, was expected to visit Thursday for talks
with the Sandinistas and UNO.
   Washington backed the Contras in their nine-year war with the
Sandinistas but now supports Mrs. Chamorro's call for their
dissolution.

   A bottling company has agreed to pay $67.5
million to the families of 15 students killed when their school bus
was knocked into a murky, water-filled pit by a Coca-Cola truck,
according to a published report.
   The crash Sept. 21 in the southern Texas town of Alton killed 21
students in Texas' worst school bus accident.
   Valley Coca-Cola Bottling Co. has agreed to pay $4.5 million for
each of 15 deaths, the McAllen Monitor reported Tuesday.
   An unidentified lawyer told the newspaper, ``We have an
agreement in principle. It's just a matter of taking this before a
court for approval and I don't see a problem with that.''
   Ramon Garcia and David Hockema, lawyers for several victims'
families, refused to discuss the negotiations.
   The soft drink company agreed two months ago to pay $1.5 million
to the family of one of the dead, the only wrongful-death
settlement completed so far. Of the 60 students injured, three
cases have been settled, each for $250,000.

   Chippewas exercising their rights under
19th century treaties to spear fish off the reservation were jeered
by hundreds of protesters when they took to their boats for the
first time this season.
   One arrest was reported Tuesday night, when the tribe's Lac du
Flambeau band, the most avid spearfishers, were met by opponents at
numerous lakes and reservoirs as in years past. Some protesters
blew whistles at the spearfishers.
   ``It's not as bad as last year, but it's still bad,'' said Matt
Valliere, a member of the Lac du Flambeau, one of six Chippewa
bands.
   The arrest came at Lake Nokomis, where 500 people, mostly
protesters, gathered. Observers said a man, who was not immediately
identified, was taken into custody while arguing with spearfishing
supporters.
   To the south, about 300 people gathered at Big Eau Pleine
Reservoir near Mosinee. Again, the crowd was mostly opposed to the
annual spring off-reservation spearfishing outings during the
spawning season.
   The Lac du Flambeau spearfish with battery-powered spotlights
mounted on boats.
   The state's Chippewa bands have the right to spear fish off the
reservation in northern Wisconsin under treaties that ceded the
northern third of the state to the U.S. government. Since 1983,
federal courts have upheld the treaties.
   Non-Indians argue that spearing during spawning depletes game
fish from lakes. Opponents also contend the treaties give Indians
unequal rights.
   One protester at the Big Eau Pleine Reservoir questioned the
Chippewa claim that the fish are used to feed their families.
   ``Who do you sell them to? What is the going rate right now?''
asked Candy Radant of Wausau, who called Indian treaties
``garbage.''
   The six Chippewa bands are eligible to spear about 41,000
walleye this spring in a season that runs into early May. Last
year, non-Indian rod-and-reel anglers took more than 600,000
walleye from Wisconsin lakes.
   The St. Croix Chippewa band opened the 1990 spearfishing season
April 10. The Mole Lake followed a few days later. The Lac Court
Oreilles and Bad River planned to start spearfishing by Wednesday
night.
   Attorney General Donald Hanaway spent nearly two hours at the
Lake Nokomis boat landing, where protesters blew referee-style
whistles.
   ``I'm really just here to observe,'' Hanaway said. A new law
prohibits harassment of anyone exercising rights to fish and hunt.
   More than 200 protesters were arrested during demonstrations
last year.

<TEXT>
   Share prices soared on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
today on expectations that declines in the stock market and the
value of the yen had bottomed out. The dollar closed marginally
higher against the yen.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average rose 787.46 points, or 2.77
percent, ending the day at 29,249.06. Wednesday's gain was the
market's ninth-largest single-day increase. The Nikkei slipped 1.58
points Tuesday.
   ``When the dollar opened this morning, as feared, above 160 yen,
many investors felt that the yen had hit bottom. They thought the
market had overcome negative factors,'' said Toshiro Inoue, an
analyst with Nomura Securities Co.
   The surge in prices picked up in the afternoon afer the dollar
fell from the day's high of 160.18 yen to below 160 yen, further
reassuring investors, Inoue said.
   Participants bought a variety of issues, including electronics,
steels, shipbuilding and trading houses.
   A drop in bond yields also helped boost share prices, other
traders said.
   The price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese government
bond slipped to 86.14 points as of 4 p.m., up from Tuesday's
85.90-point finish. The yield fell to 7.335 percent from Tuesday's
close at 7.385 percent.
   Buying by arbitrageurs trying to take profits out of the price
gap between the spot and the futures markets, as well as several
rounds of index-linked buying by investment trust firms, also
pushed prices higher, traders said.
   Inoue said many institutional investors, however, remained on
the sidelines prior to the release of the U.S. trade figures for
February later today in Washington.
   Trading was thin with first section volume estimated at 450
million shares, up from 423 million shares Tuesday.
   Since closing at a record high of 38,915.87 at the end of last
year, the Nikkei has lost 9,666.81 points, or 24.8 percent. Much of
the decline has been attributed to a softening of the yen against
the dollar. The dollar has risen 16.47 yen since the Dec. 29, when
it closed at 143.40 yen.
   In currency dealings, the dollar ended at 159.87 yen, up 0.04
yen from Tuesday's close at 159.83 yen. It opened higher at 160.13
yen and ranged between 159.80 yen and 160.18 yen.
   After opening higher following its overnight upswing in New
York, the dollar moved narrowly ahead of the announcement of the
U.S. trade figures, said Kozo Shinomiya, a Fuji Bank dealer.
   Participants bought the dollar, anticipating a substantial
improvement from January's $9.3 billion deficit, dealers said.
   ``After opening above 160 yen, which was one psychological
barrier, many investors started selling the dollar for
profit-taking partly due to a feeling of accomplishment,''
Shinomiya said.
   He said the dollar mainly fell toward the end of the afternoon
session, when selling for profit taking increased.
   ``Participants were also afraid of dollar-selling market
intervention by the Bank of Japan around 160 yen,'' he said.
   The central bank was not seen intervening in the market today.
The bank does not officially comment on its interventions.

   Scores of taxis made a slow procession past the
funeral home where the fifth driver slain in five weeks lay, in a
plea by cabbies for more protection.
   ``We're just trying to be heard by somebody, to do something to
stop these killings,'' Luz Rivera, a taxi dispatcher, said of the
cabs that snarled traffic Tuesday. ``We're sorry about this, but we
need help.''
   Five drivers have been slain in the Bronx in five weeks. A wake
was held Tuesday at a Manhattan funeral home for the latest victim,
Rafael Montes De Oca, 38, who was robbed and shot to death Saturday
night at the wheel of his cab.
   Drivers began the procession outside the office of the latest
victim's employer, Seaman Car Services, and cruised slowly to the
funeral parlor three miles away.
   No arrests have been made in the killings, which have prompted
dozens of drivers to quit their night-shift jobs in fear.
   Chief of Detectives Joseph Borrelli disputed speculation by
other investigators that three of the slayings were the work of a
serial killer.

   A teacher has been suspended without pay while
authorities investigate allegations she had her students beat up a
12-year-old classmate because ``if I hit him, I'll go to jail.''
   The boy's guardian and aunt, Vershunda Polley, said he was
jumped at Ronald McNair Elementary School last week after
disrupting class and accidentally punching the teacher in the eye
in a scuffle the day before.
   The boy told The Dallas Morning News that upon arriving at
school he found a lock had been removed from his desk and his
spiral notebook torn up. Then, the boy said, ``the whole class
surrounded me and jumped on me.''
   The boy said he crouched while classmates punched and kicked
him. He was not injured, he said. Two students said teacher Pamela
Lewis stood nearby and held the door shut for about five minutes,
breaking up the attack when another adult entered the room.
   The newspaper reported today that Ms. Lewis, 42, could not be
reached for comment. She has taught at the school for two years.
   ``My teacher told us that (the boy) was going to pick us out one
by one and fight us,'' one girl in the class said. ``She told us to
jump him and if we didn't jump in, don't come back into her
classroom.
   ``She told us, `You have to hit him, because I can't. If I hit
him, I'll go to jail.'''
   Ms. Polley, who filed a complaint with police, described her
nephew as a ``wild'' fifth-grader.
   ``After school, three kids came over to apologize,'' Ms. Polley
said. ``They said that she told them to get in one good punch or
kick. ... The kids were saying, `I didn't want to hurt you.'''

   Michael Todd Friant places no stock in
the stories about rude New Yorkers since a limousine driver
returned his wallet _ money included _ with only a library card as
a clue.
   The 13-year-old left the wallet in the car last month while in
New York with a theater group from Amarillo College.
   Driver Tom Hagan tried to mail the wallet to the Amarillo Public
Library, asking their help in finding the boy.
   But the envelope containing the wallet mistakenly ended up at
the Harrington Cancer Center, probably because the library card
says, ``Amarillo Public Library, member of the Harrington Library
Consortium.''
   The Cancer Center recently contacted Todd, who was surprised to
find the $2 he had inside the wallet was returned as well.
   ``I didn't think anybody in New York City would take the time to
send it back,'' he said.

<HEAD>Five Killed In Unrest, ANC Delegation Expected Soon</HEAD>

   Five blacks died in factional
fighting, including three women burned to death in ``necklace''
killings after blazing tires were put around their necks by mobs,
police said today.
   Senior officials of the African National Congress are expected
to arrive in South Africa on April 28 to prepare for talks four
days later with the government on ending white-minority rule, a
newspaper reported today.
   Police said five people were killed Tuesday in clashes between
rival black factions in the eastern province of Natal. Hundreds of
people have been killed in Natal in recent months in the fighting.
   Mobs killed three women in the Port Shepstone area in ritual
``necklace'' killings. Two men were killed in separate incidents.
Police did not give any reason for the killings.
   The Natal fighting pits the ANC-backed United Democratic Front
against the conservative Inkatha political movement. The rival
groups oppose apartheid, but differ over plans for a future South
Africa.
   Business Day newspaper reported Tuesday that five senior ANC
members were expected to arrive April 28 to prepare for talks with
the government. The leaders include South African Communist Party
chief Joe Slovo and ANC foreign affairs spokesman Thabo Mbeki.
   The five leaders, based at ANC headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia,
would assist ANC leader Nelson Mandela in preparing for talks in
Cape Town on clearing the way for full-scale negotiations on
sharing power with the black majority, the report said.
   President F.W. de Klerk said Tuesday that the government will
insist in the talks that the ANC renounce violence in its struggle
against apartheid. He said the ANC's advocacy of armed struggle
would hold back any negotiations on power-sharing between the white
minority and the 28 million blacks.
   ``The ANC's continued commitment to armed struggle, even if it
were merely rhetorical, constitutes a further obstacle _ alongside
the reality of the violence _ which has to be removed,'' de Klerk
said.
   In a speech to Parliament, De Klerk reiterated his views on the
constitutional system he hopes to negotiate with the ANC and other
anti-apartheid groups once obstacles to talks are removed.
   De Klerk said the government will propose black-white
power-sharing through a one-man, one-vote system. However, he said
other reforms would ensure that white domination will not be
replaced with black domination.
   The president also condemned right-wing white groups, saying
they promote ``a psychosis of violence,'' and criticized Andries
Treurnicht, leader of the pro-apartheid Conservative Party.
   ``The irrevocability of the process which has been initiated and
its urgency place an enormous responsibility on the shoulders of
every leader in our country,'' de Klerk said.
   He said political leaders must moderate their statements, ``in
the realization that negotiation is a process of debate and
agreement, of giving and taking.''
   ``If the quest by anyone is for victory before negotiation,
negotiation becomes meaningless,'' de Klerk said.

<HEAD>Trading Quiet, Gold Mixed In Anticipation of U.S. Trade Figures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar showed modest gains in quiet trading
today as dealers awaited the release later in the day of U.S. trade
figures. Gold prices were mixed.
   ``The market is nearly flat,'' a Milan trader said. ``People
have squared off their positions and are sitting tight until the
trade figures are release.''
   Traders said speculation that the February trade deficit could
swing significantly lower than the $9.25 billion deficit reported
in January was one factor keeping investors on the sidelines.
   Some traders said high expectations could pave the way for the
dollar to decline after the trade numbers are released.
   ``Even something around $8 billion won't be so good ... (since)
expectations are being raised,'' said a trader in Frankfurt, who
added that trading was ``dead'' in advance of the trade data.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.04 yen to a closing 159.87 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a lower rate of 159.70 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.6788 West German marks, up from 1.6770
   _1.4915 Swiss francs, up from 1.4900
   _5.6400 French francs, up from 5.6370
   _1.8905 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8885
   _1,234.00 Italian lire, up from 1,232.00
   _1.1630 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1680
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound, and was
quoted at $1.6345, compared with $1.6340 late Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $374.90 a troy ounce, up
from $374.05 bid late Tuesday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $374.70.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $374.90, down from $374.00 late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 48 cents to close at a bid
$375.87.
   Silver rose in London to a bid price of $5.09 a troy ounce from
Tuesday's $5.07.

   Police found bullet shells but no gunmen on
a hillside overlooking Candlestick Park after reports of snipers
sent the San Francisco Giants scrambling to a far corner of the
outfield.
   The Giants stayed in a corner of the ballpark not visible from
the hillside Tuesday night until police declared the area safe.
   The incident occurred before the Giants' game against the Los
Angeles Dodgers and delayed afternoon traffic into the ballpark for
about 45 minutes.
   Four witnesses had reported seeing snipers, one wearing a
motorcycle helmet, on the hill, police said. Sgt. William Herndon
said officers found two empty cases of 9mm shells on the hill but
were unable to locate any suspects.
   Lt. Tony Novello said snipers may have been shooting at two
police officers patrolling outside the stadium. ``It's a common
occurrence in this part of town. There is a lot of sniping, almost
every night,'' he said.

<HEAD>Pan-Africanist Congress Leader Freed Last Year Dies in Car
Accident</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Japhta Masemola, founder of
the military wing of the Pan-Africanist Congress who was freed in
October after 27 years in prison, has died in a car accident, his
sister said today. He was 58.
   Masemola was freed along with seven African National Congress
leaders in October as a prelude to President F.W. de Klerk's
legalization of the two organizations. The groups had been banned
since 1960.
   ``We just couldn't believe it ... to die after getting freed
after 27 years in prison. He wanted to do so much,'' said Dorah
Maodi, a sister of Masemola who shared a house with him in
Atteridgeville township near Pretoria.
   She said he was driving Tuesday night to Ga-Rankuwa Hospital
northwest of Pretoria to get treatment for his foot when the
accident happened. He died at the hospital.
   Masemola was already in prison when he was sentenced to life on
July 2, 1963. He was regarded by many blacks as the
second-longest-serving political prisoner after ANC deputy
president Nelson Mandela, who was freed Feb. 11.
   Masemola was sentenced for blowing up power lines and smuggling
young men out of the country for guerrilla training.
   He trained as a teacher and joined the ANC Youth League in the
early 1950s, supporting Mandela and other league leaders in their
attempts to set the ANC on a more confrontational road.
   But when activists led by the late Robert Sobukwe broke away
from the ANC in 1959 over the issues of land ownership, socialism,
workers' power and other policies, Masemola joined the new
Pan-Africanist Congress. He became PAC leader in Transvaal province.
   When both organizations were banned the next year, Masemola
founded the PAC's military wing, Poqo. It carried out sabotage
attacks on government installations before Mandela formed the ANC
military wing.

   Zsa Zsa Gabor has been ordered to
appear at a hearing to decide whether the actress completed work at
a women's shelter as part of her sentence for hitting a policeman.
   A judge ordered the May 1 hearing because the shelter's director
failed to document Miss Gabor's 120 hours of community service,
Deputy District Attorney Elden Fox said Tuesday.
   But a shelter staff member who refused to give her name told the
Los Angeles Daily News that the director mailed the documentation
to Municipal Court Judge Charles G. Rubin on Friday.
   Vera Davis, executive director of the Lower Income Elderly
United Community Assistance Program, has said Miss Gabor worked
about 50 hours at the shelter and served the rest through guest
appearances and in planning a celebrity auction at her Bel-Air
mansion to benefit the shelter.
   Rubin asked for documentation after Ms. Davis sent him a letter
stating Miss Gabor completed her sentence but offered no details,
Fox said. The prosecutor had said substituting appearances and the
auction was unacceptable.
   Miss Gabor has said she put in much more than the required 120
hours and plans to continue working to help the shelter.
   Miss Gabor was convicted Sept. 29 for slapping Officer Paul
Kramer during a traffic stop. She also was convicted of driving
without a license and having an open container of alcohol in her
Rolls-Royce. She was sentenced to four days in jail, but that
portion of the sentence is being appealed.

   British government agencies might have allowed the
sale of arms components to Iraq before customs agents seized
Iraq-bound steel pipes that could be used for a huge gun, a
newspaper said today.
   ``Sources indicated that the Department of Trade and Industry
and the Ministry of Defense may have known the military potential
of the order, raising the specter of government departments
conniving to break Britain's embargo on arms trade with Iraq,'' The
Independent newspaper said.
   The report, based on unidentified British Civil Service sources,
also said Customs officers were under intense political pressure by
the government not to prosecute the suppliers.
   ``Government officials want the makers of the steel pipes ... to
be protected from court proceedings which could reveal the extent
of the government involvement in the deal,'' it said.
   A senior government source described The Independent report as
``absolute rubbish.'' Government sources acknowledged there were
``some military aspects to all this,'' but they did not elaborate.
   Customs seized eight forged steel tubes last Thursday at the
port of Middlesbrough in northeastern England as they were about to
be shipped to Iraq. Officials say the tubes could be used as part
of a giant artillery gun to fire shells hundreds of miles. The
makers of the tubes, Sheffield Forgemasters, denies this, and Iraq
says the pipes were meant for the petrochemical industry.
   The Financial Times, Britain's leading business daily, reported
today that the British and Belgian governments have evidence a
Belgian defense company, PRB, was contracted by Iraq to help
produce a booster-assisted shell for a long-range artillery gun.
   PRB is owned by the British munitions company Astra Holdings.
   The Financial Times said contracts for the suspected gun
components and the projectile were coordinated by companies
associated with ballistics expert Gerald Bull, a Canadian-born
American murdered in Brussels March 22.
   The company Walter Somers, a subsidiary of Eagle Trust, said
Tuesday it was now concerned that hydraulic gear sent to Iraq in
October could be used as part of a shock absorber, possibly a
hydraulic recoil mechanism, in a huge gun.
   Eagle Trust chairman David James said: ``Our engineers are now
wondering whether they have been misled up the garden path by the
Iraqis.''
   James said Walter Somers decided to re-examine its contracts
with Iraq following Bull's murder. He said Bull and his
Brussels-based company, Space Research Corp., acted as agents for
various Iraqi orders and were the source of technical data and
drawings related to them.
   Belgian police said Bull, 62, was shot twice in the head and
that the gunman used a silencer. The motive was not robbery because
$20,000 was found in the victim's pockets, police said.

   When the kids munch a Big Mac sometime later
this year, they may be doing it while sitting on a bench made of
recycled plastic. The paper bag to carry it home may be made out of
an old newspaper.
   McDonald's Corp., announced Tuesday that it plans to spend $100
million a year, about one-fourth of its construction budget, on
recycled materials when building new outlets or renovating existing
ones. It dubbed the program McRecycle USA.
   ``We think there need to be markets created for recycled
materials,'' Edward H. Rensi, president of McDonald's USA, said in
a telephone interview from Oak Brook, Ill. ``We decided to create a
market.''
   Rensi said that in addition to seeking out recycled products
when building new restaurants, the company plans soon to use
recycled newsprint for carryout bags at about 500 of its outlets.
If it works, the use of the newsprint will be expanded.
   ``They're not going to be as white as we necessarily would like,
but they're going to be fully serviceable, the printing on them is
just fine, and to be able to use ... newsprint is just fantastic,''
Rensi said.
   He said McDonald's will seek out suppliers of recycled building
materials through a toll-free telephone number.
   The uses of recycled materials are numerous and not expected to
cost significantly more, Rensi said. ``We have a lot of
opportunities.''
   He said some of the possible uses of recycled plastics and other
materials are as barriers to keep cars from going onto the curb in
parking lots, building insulation, mop buckets, menu boards,
chairs, tables, signs and playground equipment.
   McDonald's builds about 375 new restaurants each year and
renovates an additional 1,000 of its 8,500 outlets annually.
   Earlier this year, McDonald's announced a pilot program in some
of its New England outlets that promotes the recycling of
polystyrene food containers and other plastics.
   ``We think (the program) is working very well, but it can work a
lot better because we've only got 250 restaurants on the program
right now. We hope to add about 25 restaurants a week and get up to
500 very soon,'' Rensi said.
   Eventually the company hopes to expand the program to all of its
restaurants.
   But Rensi said McDonald's, which serves 22 million people daily
worldwide and is one of the largest users of plastic food
containers, has no plans to shift away from using plastics, which
do not degrade in landfills.
   A number of communities have begun to consider barring the use
of polystyrene containers by fast-food restaurants because of
growing concerns about shrinking landfills.
   Rensi maintained, however, that the polystyrene containers can
be recycled, while coated paper used in food packaging often cannot.
   ``Paper does not do the kinds of things people think it does,''
he said. ``You put it in a landfill and it doesn't biodegrade. Food
packaging particularly doesn't biodegrade because it's wrapped in
some kind of a compound ... and you can't recycle it. It's
cost-prohibitive.
   ``We'd rather use more plastic than less. And we think ... if
public opinion ever catches up to science, consumers are going to
applaud us for sticking to it,'' the McDonald's executive added.

   Computer viruses are spreading through China's
computer networks and could cause severe losses to data bases, the
official China Daily said today.
   The Public Security Ministry has discovered six viruses,
including one called ``Jerusalem'' that appeared on Friday, the
report said.
   It said thousands of computers have been infected by an external
virus, a program that can reproduce itself indefinitely and either
slow down or destroy other programs in a system.
   The computer center at one Beijing university suspended
operations because its 50 terminals were infected. Production at a
Beijing chemical factory was slowed for a month when a virus
attacked company computers, it said.
   The ministry said other viruses have appeared with such names as
Vienna, Brain, 648, Hemp and Yankee Doodle. It urged a complete
check of China's computers and disks and asked people to
immediately report any evidence of tampering with computer programs.
   China, a nation of 1.1 billion, has only about 300,000
computers. Only a few state organizations, such as the police, the
military and the State Statistical Bureau, have on-line systems
connecting computers.
   The Public Security Ministry said in November that as many as 10
percent of the computers checked had been affected by viruses. It
said the viruses had been contained in imported software.

<TEXT>
   Nepal's prime minister-designate
nominated eight cabinet ministers today to form this Himalayan
kingdom's first opposition-led government in almost 30 years.
   Prime Minister-designate K.P. Bhattarai, acting president of the
once-outlawed Nepali Congress Party, said he would retain the posts
of defense and foreign minister in the new government.
   Bhattarai said he had sent a list of his nominees to the palace
for approval by King Birendra, who on April 8 lifted a nearly
30-year ban on political activity in response to pro-democracy
protests.
   Bhattarai, 65, who spent 14 years in prison for political
agitation, said he did not expect the king to block the nomination
of any of his nominees.
   ``It is not a question of his agreement,'' Bhattarai said. ``It
is a question of my wanting.''
   Bhattarai's cabinet nominees included three Congress Party
members, three United Left Front members and two independents.
   The king wielded almost absolute power until he was forced to
make concessions by opposition groups. Earlier this week, Prime
Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand was dismissed after he was besieged
in a building by pro-democracy demonstrators.
   The opposition has said it wants the 44-year-old king to act as
the constitutional monarch of a parliamentary democracy, with
lawmakers holding the real power.
   The king will name two of his own nominees for the cabinet on
Thursday. Later that day, Bhattarai and his ministers will take
their oaths of office.
   The interim government headed by Bhattarai is expected to remain
in power until free general elections can be held. Bhattarai said
the vote will be held by April 1991.
   The pro-democracy movement was led by Bhattarai's centrist
Nepali Congress Party and the United Left Front, a coalition of
left-wing groups, including the Communist Party.
   Birendra's father, King Mahendra, banned political parties in
1961 after two years of Western-style party government headed by
the Nepali Congress Party. Mahendra dismissed the government,
accusing it of corruption and inept administration.
   Afterward, the country was controlled by a partyless political
structure known as the panchayat, or council, with the king as the
head of state.
   The monarch nominated one-fifth of the National Assembly's 140
members, and approved the nominations of others running for
election, according to political observers.
   Nepal, a predominantly Hindu nation of 17 million, is one of the
world's poorest nations, with a per capita annual income of $150.

<TEXT>
   A judge awarded custody of a 10-month-old
boy orphaned by the October earthquake to a cousin, ending months
of family squabbling over the child and the $1 million he stands to
collect.
   Superior Court Judge Roderic Duncan on Tuesday placed James
Brown IV with his mother's cousin instead of with his maternal
grandmother or paternal grandfather, who had accused each other of
being unfit to raise the baby.
   The child will live with Arthur and Tonia Lewis on their 50-acre
hog and cattle ranch near Chowchilla, about 120 miles from San
Francisco. Duncan said that before the hearing, the grandparents
and the Lewises met and agreed to a visitation schedule.
   The judge last month had awarded temporary custody to the
Lewises and also removed the money issue by putting a guardian in
charge of the boy's estate.
   Lewis attended the court hearing and smiled broadly when he
signed the custody settlement. But Lewis, cousin to the baby's dead
mother, declined to comment, saying only that the boy is ``doing
wonderfully.''
   The child is scheduled to receive $100,000 in damages for his
parents' deaths, but the settlement may reach upwards of $1 million
by the time the case is finally resolved.
   The custody fight started shortly after the Oct. 17 earthquake,
which claimed the lives of Jimmy's unmarried parents, 18-year-old
Michelle Marie Richard and 20-year-old James Brown III.
   They were among the 42 people killed in the collapse of the
Nimitz Freeway; all told, 68 people died in the 7.1-magnitude quake.
   Richard's mother, Anita Williams, 35, and Brown's father, James
Brown II, 37, sought custody of the infant and the compensation he
was getting from the state. Both had been taking turns caring for
the child.
   Ms. Williams is raising her own children on welfare; during
court proceedings, she was accused of consorting with drug abusers.
And Brown is on parole after going to prison for theft.
   By Tuesday, two others had filed for custody _ James Brown II's
brother and the infant's paternal grandmother.
   But the three grandparents and the uncle finally agreed to give
him up to the Lewises, who also have a 5-year-old daughter and have
been unable to conceive other children.
   ``It's absolutely wonderful,'' said S. Simone Campbell, the
child's attorney, who recommended that the Lewises get custody.
``We got the lawyers out of the room and left the families to work
it out.''
   Campbell said the Lewises, who both work on the farm, were the
first choice because they could be with Jimmy all day.
   ``All of their jobs allow them to constantly be by Jimmy,''
Campbell said. ``He doesn't have to be in day care. It's better
than with the other families.''
   Afterward, Ms. Williams' attorney, Don Foley, said his client
was comfortable with the decision ``but still disappointed. She has
made a decent adjustment. He's still part of her life.''

   A mentally ill man who claimed to have a bomb
hijacked an Aeroflot jetliner to Lithuania today, but he was
arrested without incident when the aircraft landed in the
republic's capital, officials said.
   The hijacker wanted to help Lithuania by turning over the
state-owned Tu-134 jet to the Baltic republic, said Marijonas
Misiukonis, Lithuania's internal affairs minister. Moscow recently
threatened Lithuania with an economic blockade after the republic
delcared independence.
   No explosives were found after police took the man into custody
in the capital of Vilnius, said Valery Akolsin, spokesman for the
Soviet Ministry of Civil Aviation.
   No injuries were reported among the approximately 70 passengers
aboard Flight 2443, which was en route from Moscow to Leningrad
when the hijacking occurred. American, Japanese and Cuban tourists
were among the passengers, Vilnius Radio said. The number of crew
members was not immediately known.
   The radio said the man, identified as Igor Kalugin, claimed to
have acquaintances in Lithuania.
   Kalugin boarded the flight at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport,
then shortly after takeoff told the cabin attendent he was carrying
a bomb in a parcel and demanded the plane change course, Akolsin
said.
   ``He called for the stewardess and claimed that he had an
explosive device in his lap, and pointed to paper wrapped around an
object he was holding tightly against himself,'' Akolsin said.
   The aircraft's three-man cockpit crew agreed to Kalugin's
demands after consulting with authorities on the ground and
receiving permission to land in Vilnius, the spokesman said.
   After the plane landed, it taxied to a remote section of the
airport, where Kalugin, still clutching the parcel, was put into a
car and driven from the airport, according to a tower dispatcher.
   The other passengers were taken off the plane and transferred to
a special hall for foreigners while authorities searched the plane
for explosives.
   After finding none in a 90-minute search, authorities allowed
the plane to resume its journey to Leningrad, Akolsin said.
   Akolsin said Kalugin was a registered patient at a psychiatric
clinic in Moscow. Misiukonis also said he was registered in Moscow
as being mentally ill.
   Vilnius Radio said the man, about 46 or 47 years old, was
employed as a fireman at a Moscow theater.

   The court, in an opinion by Justice Byron R. White, did not bar
judges from ordering tax increases, however.
   White said the judge could have ordered, in a less specific way,
Kansas City school officials ``to levy property taxes at a rate
adequate to fund the desegregation remedy, and could have enjoined
the operation of state laws that would have prevented (the school
district) from exercising this power,'' White said.
   The court's vote on that point was 5-4. Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Sandra Day O'Connor and
Antonin Scalia dissented, decrying the court's ``casual embrace of
taxation imposed by the unelected, life-tenured federal judiciary.''

   Airports will never be safe from
terrorist acts, which are on the rise and getting bloodier, despite
new bomb detection systems developed by the federal government, the
FBI's chief bomb technician says.
   ``The numbers just keep going up, and we don't see anything
that's going to negate that trend,'' Robert Quigley, the head of
the FBI's Bomb Data Center, said Tuesday. ``I don't think airports
will ever become a hard target, because they have to have a level
of free (public) access anyway.''
   There were 4,368 terrorist incidents around the world last year,
up from 3,734 in 1988, Quigley said. Bombings rose to 1,930 in 1989
from 1,622 in 1988. The figures came from a private research
company.
   In one of the most notorious incidents, a bomb said to be
concealed as a radio felled Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie,
Scotland, on Dec. 21, 1988. All 259 people on board, as well as 11
people on the ground, were killed.
   ``We don't see it will end ... not in my lifetime,'' said
Quigley, who along with a host of other bomb and security experts
gathered Tuesday at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to
discuss the status of airport safety.
   Still, Raymond Salazar, the director of civil aviation security
for the Federal Aviation Administration, said he thought it was
``definitely possible'' to stem the tide of terrorism.
   No anti-terrorism policy will ever be 100 percent effective,
Salazar said. But terrorists won't win if the civilized world
launches a multipronged effort _ based on cooperation among local
governments, law enforcement and intelligence _ against them.
   ``I think it's definitely possible if all those things come into
play,'' he said.
   The arsenal against terrorists now includes automated
explosive-detection systems developed by the FAA, Salazar said. He
estimated the FAA spent about $60 million over 10 years to develop
the systems, which use neutrons _ uncharged atomic particles _ to
detect explosives.
   The systems are already being used in New York City and Miami,
and should be deployed in about 40 cities worldwide over the next
two years, he said.
   Critics have called the new systems ``too large, too slow, like
trying to stuff an elephant into a horse's stall,'' Salazar said.
``To these critics I say, you have to start somewhere. You can't
wait for perfect while you have good available.''

<HEAD>Prague Prosecutor Threatens to Outlaw Communists in Prague</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Prague prosecutor has
threatened to outlaw the Communist Party within the city limits
just as campaigning is about to begin for Czechoslovakia's first
free elections, a newspaper said today.
   In a letter to the Communist Party's Central Committee,
Prosecutor Tomas Sokol drew a parallel between communism and
fascism, which is illegal in Czehoslovakia. He set an April 30
deadline for the party to clarify its views.
   ``As of May 1, the political activity of your party will be
judged with a view to committing the criminal act of propagating
fascism or similar movements,'' the Svobodne Slovo daily newspaper
quoted Sokol as saying.
   The Justice Ministry had no immediate comment, and a spokesman
for President Vaclav Havel also declined comment. The Communist
Party said it would make an official comment later.
   All Communist deputies, about 40 percent of Parliament, reacted
by failing to attend a debate on the fate of Interior Minister
Richard Sacher, accused of not dealing harshly enough with the
disbanded secret police.
   The accusations were made by the Civic Forum, which led last
winter's pro-democracy revolution and now dominates the government.
The Communist move forced the debate to be postponed.
   Sacher heads the People's Party, part of a Christian Democratic
coalition that poses some of the toughest opposition to Civic Forum
in the June 8 elections. But the Communists, who still claim 1
million party members in a nation of 15.5 million, also pose tough
opposition to Civic Forum, and placed second in recent opinion
polls.
   In his letter, Sokol said fascism and communism had in common
``destruction of all democratic rights'' and ``the method of terror
and social demagoguery.'' According to Czechoslovak law,
propagation of fascism is punishable by up to eight years in jail
if committed publicly using the media.
   ``A deadline of April 30 was set to clarify the true essence of
your ideology as well as settling of all administrative matters
connected with the liquidation of your exposure in ... Prague,''
the letter said.
   The Communist daily Rude Pravo today protested publication of
the letter in the Czechoslovak media.
   ``Does this letter ... have any connection with the fact that
the elections campaign starts in a couple of days? ... Is this a
contribution to the newly formed objective justice, the culture and
decency of the campaign,'' the daily said in an editorial.

<TEXT>
   Mexico has demanded that Washington explain
how U.S. agents seized a Mexican doctor charged in the murder of
U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena, following reports that the doctor
was kidnapped by bounty hunters.
   The physician, Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain, was delivered to
Los Angeles this month to face charges in Camarena's 1985 torture
and murder.
   The Los Angeles Times reported today that Alvarez was kidnapped
in an unauthorized operation arranged by officials of the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration's office in Los Angeles.
   Citing unidentified Mexican sources close to the case, it said a
bounty of up to $50,000 reportedly was offered to the four
kidnappers and two pilots who took Alvarez from Mexico to El Paso,
Texas, where he was arrested on April 3.
   Frank Shults, a DEA spokesman in Washington, refused to comment
on how Alvarez arrived in the United States but said the arrest had
violated no laws.
   The Times quoted the Mexican sources as saying American
officials told them the kidnapping was carried out without approval
from Washington.
   Mexico's Foreign Ministry said in a statement Tuesday night that
Mexican diplomats in Washington would ask the State Department
``about the location and conditions'' under which Alvarez was
apprehended.
   It said Mexico was concerned about reports alleging he ``could
have been arrested illegally in Mexico with the participation of
U.S. authorities.''
   Leftist politicians and newspaper columnists have been calling
the case an affront to Mexico's sovereignty for two weeks, but this
was the first expression of concern from the Mexican government.
   On Tuesday, the country's Congress asked for an investigation
and U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh told a news conference in
Washington that he has asked for a full report on the incident.
Thornburgh was to fly to Mexico today to attend a conference on
drug enforcement.
   Alvarez, 42, is one of 19 Mexicans who have been indicted by a
federal grand jury in Los Angeles on charges of kidnapping,
torturing and killing Camarena, a DEA special agent.
   Charges against suspected participants in the murders in
Guadalajara of Camarena and his pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar, have
strained U.S.-Mexican relations.
   U.S. law enforcement officials say the Mexican government failed
to respond to their requests to extradite several defendants.
Mexican officials say the United States had never requested the
extradition of Alvarez or anyone else indicted in the case.
   A Jan. 31 indictment in Los Angeles contained the latest round
of charges in the case. Besides Alvarez, it named Manuel Ibarra
Herrera, former director of the Mexican Federal Judicial Police,
and Miguel Aldana Ibarra, former head of the Mexican office of
Interpol, the international law-enforcement agency.
   The call in Mexico's Congress for an investigation into case was
initiated by leftist parties and then backed by the opposition
National Action Party.
   National Action congressman Jesus Rodriguez del Valle questioned
whether Mexican ``federal police or DEA agents were directly
involved, and if they received compensation.''
   U.S. prosecutors allege that Camarena was abducted by drug
traffickers and tortured by Mexican officials about DEA activities
in Mexico.
   Alvarez, a Guadalajara gynecologist, allegedly observed
Camarena's torture and administered drugs to revive the American so
he could be subjected to more questioning.
   The Mexican doctor pleaded innocent on April 10, when he was
arraigned on the charges in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles.
   Alvarez's lawyer, Robert Steinberg, said his client had been
kidnapped but that he would not raise the abduction as a legal
issue because prior rulings in similar cases said, in effect, ``too
bad, but they're here.''
   Alvarez is to face trial in Los Angeles on May 1 along with four
other defendants in the case, including Juan Ramon Matta
Ballesteros.
   Matta Ballesteros, a convicted drug trafficker, unsuccessfully
challenged his 1988 arrest in Honduras and deportation to the
United States.
   Steinberg said Alvarez was taken from his Guadalajara office on
April 2 by four or five men who identified themselves as Mexican
federal police and who said Alvarez was under arrest for performing
illegal abortions.
   The group drove north to an unidentified town, where they spent
the night. The next day, Alvarez was placed on a plane that flew
him across the border to El Paso. He was taken off the plane by a
DEA agent and placed under arrest.
   Rene Verdugo Urquidez was convicted in California in 1988 of
taking part in the kidnapping, torture and murder of Camarena and
his pilot. He was arrested by Mexican authorities who were paid to
turn him over to U.S. agents. He is serving a sentence of 240 years
plus life.

   Israeli troops fatally shot a Palestinian
during clashes in a Gaza Strip refugee camp today, and Arabs fired
automatic rifles at an army post in the West Bank, Arab reporters
said.
   Also today, the army said a Palestinian from the West Bank
village of Hableh was killed this week when a bomb he was
apparently preparing exploded.
   No one was wounded in the West Bank shooting, which took place
in the heart of the crowded shopping district of the city of
Nablus, Arab reports said. It was the second rifle attack on an
army post in a week.
   The army had no reports of shooting in Nablus.
   In the Khan Yunis refugee camp in the occupied Gaza Strip,
troops opened fire to disperse sone throwers, hitting 20-year-old
Gazi Abed Rabbo Abu Mustafa in the abdomen, an Arab reporter said.
Mustafa was taken to nearby Nasser Hospital where he died, the
reporter said.
   The army confirmed Mustafa's death and said he was known by
security forces as an inciter and had been wounded in the leg
during earlier protests he organized.
   Mustafa's death brought to 674 the number of Palestinians killed
by Israeli soldiers and civilians during the 28-month-old uprising
against Israeli occupation.
   At least 207 other Palestinians have been slain by fellow Arabs,
mostly on suspicion of collaborating with Israel, and 43 Israels
have died in the violence.
   The victim killed by the explosion on April 16, Yousef Faud
Attal, 25, had been wanted by security forces for two years on
suspicion of attacking Israelis and Palestinians accused of
collaborating with authorities, the army said.
   The gunmen involved in the Nablus shooting did not mask their
faces when they opened fire at the rooftop army post from an alley
in the crowded shopping district, an Arab reporter said.
   The army immediately closed the area, arrested three people
during searches and sealed two shops near the army post, the
reporter said.
   PLO chief Yasser Arafat has urged Palestinians not to use guns
against Israeli soldiers, arguing it would give Israel an excuse to
adopt even harsher measures against the uprising. Radical factions
of the Palestine Liberation Organization and Moslem fundamentalists
favor the use of guns.
   In another development, an Israeli military court Tuesday
imposed a five-month suspended sentence on an army officer
convicted of brutality in the beating of a 14-year-old Nablus boy,
the army spokesman said.
   Second Lt. Benyamin Yunes pounded the boy's forehead with his
helmet and hit him after taking him into custody during a
stone-throwing incident, the spokesman said.
   Trial is continuing for two co-defendants in the case. The daily
Maariv said that one of them acknowledged extinguishing cigarettes
on the youth.

   A former state Democratic Party chairman said he
was ``thoroughly vindicated'' by his acquittal on charges that he
took part in a scheme to bribe Dominican Republic officials to
release drug planes.
   U.S. District Judge James Kehoe on Tuesday acquitted Alfredo
Duran before the defense presented its case. The judge said the
government failed to prove the charges against him were a crime
under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
   The case went awry in the past month after one of the defendants
was revealed to be a Drug Enforcement Administration informant, and
a chief prosecution witness turned out to be an attorney who failed
to inform clients he was secretly cooperating with federal
investigators.
   ``I feel that I have been thoroughly vindicated,'' said Duran,
53, who could have faced a maximum five years in prison. ``I was
ready to take the stand in my own defense. I am very happy.''
   Democratic Party officials at the time of the November
indictment called it a political vendetta by U.S. Attorney Dexter
Lehtinen, a former Republican state senator whose wife is a
Republican congresswoman.
   Duran's defense attorney, Donald Bierman, played down the
political angle in the case. Duran was state party chairman from
1976 to 1980.
   ``I think that it was a very poorly thought-out prosecution, but
I don't personally believe it was political,'' said Bierman.
   Diane Cossin, spokeswoman for Lehtinen, again denied any
political motivation behind Duran's indictment, saying such charges
showed a misunderstanding of the grand jury system that brought the
indictment.

   Canadian military authorities today
grounded F-18 training flights until investigators learn why two
fighter jets collided in an accident that renewed German demands
for an end to such NATO exercises.
   Tuesday's crash left one Canadian pilot dead and another
injured, and showered parts of Karlsruhe with flaming debris,
crushing several cars and damaging buildings in the southwestern
city of 285,000 people. West German media said it was a miracle no
civilians were killed.
   The collision of the two Canadian fighters reminded Germans of
the 1988 military jet disasters at the Ramstein U.S. Air Force base
and in the central West German city of Remscheid. Both accidents
killed German civilians as well as NATO pilots.
   The accident rekindled debate over the dozens of military
training flights that criss-cross West German skies each day. West
Germans have said they would like to see the missions sharply
curtailed as East-West relations improve.
   Hans-Jochen Vogel, head of the opposition Social Democrats,
today demanded an immediate end to the NATO practice flights over
densely populated areas.
   Friedel Laepple, interior minister for Saarland state and a
Social Democrat, demanded a stop to all military training flights
over West Germany.
   The West German government was also concerned and used some of
the most pointed language to date after a military crash.
   The Defense Ministry in Bonn said it has ``urgently asked the
Canadian air force to quickly and comprehensively clear up the
causes of the accident.''
   In a statement, the ministry said it asked the Canadians to
examine whether ``interceptor training with F-18s'' should be
stopped until the reasons for the accident are known.
   The Canadian Forces today announced all F-18 air-to-air training
flights were grounded until the cause of the collision is
determined.
   A spokeswoman for the Canadian Forces in Lahr, Baerbel Newman,
said both flight recorders had been found, but the cause of the
collision was not known.
   Maj. John Paul Macdonald, spokesman for Canadian Forces in Lahr,
said the Canadian Air Force F-18s collided at about 9,800 feet.
   Burning debris, ripped from the jets in the collision, rained
down on Karlsruhe streets. West German television quoted witnesses
as saying the engine of one jet smashed into a building near a gas
station.
   Karlsruhe officials said about 50 damage reports were filed.
   In Canada, the father of the dead pilot told Canadian Press that
his son, Capt. Timothy Kirk Leuty, 30, was nearing the end of his
stint in West Germany as a member of the 439th Squadron based in
Baden-Soellingen.
   ``We were really looking forward to his coming home,'' Stan
Leuty said from his home in Meaford, Ontario. ``He was due to leave
in June and he was going to be based in Cold Lake, Alberta, when he
got back.''
   The other pilot, Capt. Reginald deCoste, 35, of Jonquiere,
Quebec, ejected safely and landed on a highway, breaking both
heels. He was listed in good condition at an area hospital,
Macdonald said.
   The two pilots had taken off from Baden-Soellingen Air Base near
Rastatt, about 25 miles southwest of Karlsruhe, police said. The
Canadian Air Force has 48 F-18s at the base.
   Thousands of Canadian soldiers are stationed in West Germany as
part of a multinational NATO force. They routinely take part in
Allied military manuevers, including air training.

   A series of strong earthquakes struck
Northern California today, rattling the nerves of residents in a
100-mile area from San Francisco south to Salinas on the
anniversary of the catastrophic 1906 quake.
   The hardest quake struck at 6:54 a.m. and measured a preliminary
5.4 on the Richter scale, Allen Lindh of the U.S. Geological Survey
said. The UC-Berkeley Seismographic Station measured the quake at a
preliminary 5.5 on the Richter scale.
   Both agencies said the quakes hit just east of Watsonville,
about 60 miles south of San Francisco, in the Loma Prieta area,
where the October 17 quake measured 7.1 on the Richter scale.
   The two other strong quakes today included one at 6:38 a.m. that
measured a preliminary 4.5 on the Richter scale, centered four
miles east-southeast of Watsonville, and another 4.5 quake at 6:41
a.m.
   Watsonville police dispatcher Bob Spidle described the first
quake, saying: ``It bounced. We've had lots of calls, but I've had
no reports of any damage.''
   Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. reported power loss to 6,500
customers in the Watsonville area.
   San Francisco police said they received many calls from worried
residents, but no damage and no injuries were reported.
   Only the night before a rally featuring displays on earthquake
safety had been held to mark the six-month anniversary of the Oct.
17, 1989, quake, which killed 68 people and caused billions in
damage. And survivors of the Great Earthquake that destroyed San
Francisco in 1906 had gathered at dawn to commemorate the occasion.
   On Tuesday, Southern California quivered from a series of
aftershocks from a February earthquake, and a small temblor hit
rural, eastern Indiana. There were no damages or injuries reported
from those two areas.
   Tuesday's quake measured 4.6 on the Richter scale and was
centered three miles west of Upland, said Robert Finn, spokesman
for the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. Upland is
40 miles east of Los Angeles.
   The 3:32 p.m. quake was the strongest in a swarm of minor
tremors in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains. Three
smaller tremors followed within two hours, all in the same area,
Finn said.
   The shocks were in an area of the San Antonio Canyon fault that
was not ruptured in the Feb. 28 quake, which measured 5.5 on the
Richter scale and inflicted some serious damage to older buildings.
   Indiana's Tuesday morning quake shook buildings, rattled windows
and woke up residents, but caused no damage, Jay County authorities
said.
   Michael Hamburger, seismologist and geology professor at Indiana
University, put the quake's magnitude at 2.5 to 3 on the Richter
scale and its epicenter in eastern Jay County, about 65 miles
northeast of Indianapolis.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.
   The San Francisco earthquake of April 18, 1906, which occurred
before the Richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on
the Richter scale. The quake and subsequent fire were blamed for an
estimated 700 deaths.

<HEAD>Court Rules Judge Exceeded Authority in Kansas City Desegregation
Case</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Combines pvs, editing throughout.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court ruled today that a federal
judge may not personally raise property taxes to pay for school
desegregation but can order school officials to do so.
   By a 9-0 vote, the court said U.S. District Judge Russell G.
Clark abused his discretion when he personally imposed a school
district tax hike in Kansas City, Mo.
   But in a victory for civil rights forces, the court upheld most
of the steps Clark ordered school officials to take to racially
desegregate the schools.
   In a 5-4 vote, the court said the judge could order officials to
raise taxes to pay for the ordered desegregation remedies and could
instruct them to ignore state laws limiting the anount of school
taxes.
   Writing for the court, Justice Byron White used sweeping
language that could affect school-desegregation cases nationwide.
   ``A local government with taxing authority may be ordered to
levy taxes in excess of the limit set by state statute where there
is reason based in the Constitution for not observing the statutory
limitation,'' White wrote.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Anthony M.
Kennedy, Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia dissented, decrying
the court's ``casual embrace of taxation imposed by the unelected,
life-tenured federal judiciary.''
   Clark went too far, the court said today. ``Local officials
should at least have the opportunity to devise their own solutions
to these problems,'' White wrote.
   White's opinion was joined by Justices William J. Brennan,
Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens.
   Through the last three decades, the court has given federal
judges sweeping power to take whatever steps necessary to end
racial segregation in public schools. Those steps have included the
forced busing of students, teacher reassignments, and even the
partial merger of separate school districts.
   But the court in January split 5-4 in limiting federal judges'
power to stamp out civil rights violations as it overturned fines
against Yonkers, N.Y., councilmen who blocked a housing
desegregation plan.
   The court said the judge who imposed the fines had exceeded his
authority, and should have waited to see whether potentially
bankrupting penalties against the city would force adoption of the
desegregation plan.
   In arguments before the justices last October on the Kansas City
case, Missouri lawyer H. Barton Farr III, representing the state,
called a tax increase ordered by an unelected judge ``taxation
without representation.''
   When it comes to federal courts, Farr said then, ``There is no
power to tax, period.''
   Today's decision rejected that argument.
   Before 1954, Missouri law required schools to be racially
segregated. In the following 35 years, the percentage of black
students in Kansas City's school district rose from 22.5 to about
75 percent.
   Black parents sued in 1977 over the decline of what had become
predominantly black schools, alleging that black students were
being denied equal educational opportunities.
   Clark ruled in 1987 that the school district's ``physical
facilities have literally rotted,'' and ordered state and district
officials to upgrade them.
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld most of Clark's
order, saying, ``There are still vestiges of the dual school system
lingering in the (city school district), and the district and the
state have not met their obligations to disestablish that system.''
   The judge's orders called for two major remedies:
   _A ``magnet school'' plan by the 1991-92 school year in which
every high school and middle school and about half the elementary
schools in the district will feature distinctive themes such as
foreign languages, performing arts or math and science.
   _A capital improvements program costing some $260 million, to be
completed by next fall.
   The state was ordered to pay three-fourths of the remedial
costs; the school district one-fourth.
   School district voters had rejected six proposals since 1970 to
increase taxes for education. Clark nearly doubled the local
property tax _ ordering the school district to raise the tax from
$2.05 to $4 per $100 of assessed valuation to help finance the
capital improvements.
   ``The court must weigh the constitutional rights of the
taxpayers against the constitutional rights of (black) students in
this case,'' Clark said. ``The balance is clearly in favor of the
students who are helpless without the aid of this court.''
   The 8th Circuit court upheld the tax hike in 1988. Today, the
nation's highest court struck down the specific tax hike ordered,
but left open the option of some tax hike being imposed by the
school district under court order.
   The case is Missouri vs. Jenkins, 88-11150.

<TEXT>
   Battling Christian forces hit a school
bus at a crossing gateway between east and west Beirut today,
setting it on fire and killing at least 15 people, 11 of them
children, police reported.
   ``Many of the pupils yelled for help as we tried to extinguish
the fire. At least one teacher also was among the dead along with
the driver,'' a soldier on the scene said.
   A police spokesman said the bus was hit at 2:30 p.m. while
trying to cross to Christian east Beirut.
   The spokesman, who cannot be named in line with regulations,
said the bus from Mraijeh elementary school, a new private school
in south Beirut, was hit by an incendiary rifle grenade, which
ignited the fuel tank.
   ``It couldn't be determined who fired the rifle grenade,'' the
spokesman said.
   It was not immediately clear why students from predominantly
Christian east Beirut were attending primary school in south
Beirut, a Shiite Moslem stronghold. But many students are among the
estimated 30,000 people who commute across the line daily.
   The radio station of Christian Gen. Michel Aoun said the bus was
fired at by rival gunmen of Samir Geagea's Lebanese Forces militia.
   ``Geagea's fire burned out the children,'' the broadcast said.
   Geagea's command could not be reached by telephone from west
Beirut to comment on the report.
   However, the pro-Geagea Voice of Lebanon radio station called
the hit ``mysterious.''
   The gutted wreckage of the yellow bus lay on the pavement in the
Aoun-controlled sector, a few yards east of the museum crossing
that links Beirut's eastern and western sectors across the dividing
Green Line.
   The army private, one of the soldiers serving under Aoun, said
he and his colleagues ``doused off the burning bus with water and
we evacuated the victims to nearby hospitals.''
   The attack followed intermittent skirmishing and a powerful
explosion that reportedly demolished two floors of Aoun's defense
ministry. News reports said three soldiers were killed. Aoun's
command said two were killed. It was not immediately clear what
caused the blast.
   Aoun has been locked in bloody power struggle with Geagea for
more than two months. They have been battling since Jan. 30 for
control of the 310-square-mile Christian enclave. The fighting has
killed 877 people and wounded 2,388.
   Meanwhile, rival Shiite Moslem militias fought a 90-minute gun
battle this morning in Syrian-policed west Beirut, and one person
was killed and four wounded, the police spokesman said.
   The clash between the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God,
and the Syrian-backed Amal, Arabic for ``Hope,'' subsided after
about 100 Syrian soldiers moved in to stop the confrontation.
   Police said 12 people have been killed and 52 wounded since the
latest round of Amal-Hezbollah clashes broke out in west and south
Beirut Tuesday.
   The police spokesman said most of the casualties were civilians,
including children, caught in the cross-fire of fierce street
battles across densely populated residential districts.
   Amal, in a communique, blamed the confrontation on Hezbollah,
charging that the fundamentalist faction wanted to ``block efforts
being exerted to release the (Western) hostages held by
Hezbollah.'' It did not elaborate.
   Hezbollah has repeatedly denied involvement in the abduction of
the 18 Westerners, including eight Americans, missing in Lebanon.
   However, Hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella for the
underground hostage-holding factions that follow the teachings of
the late Iranian revolutionary patriarch Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini.
   There now appears to be a power struggle in Iran between
government officials who support the release of the hostages and
radical hard-liners who view hostage-taking as a way to punish the
``corrupt'' West.
   The police spokesman said that despite Syrian patrols, fighters
from Amal and Hezbollah maintained their rooftop positions in
Beirut, threatening a renewal of all-out fighting.
   Rival Shiite fighters also skirmished in southern Lebanon's
Iqlim el-Tuffah province early in the day, but no casualties were
reported, the police spokesman said.
   Amal and Hezbollah have been fighting on and off for more than
two years for Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites, the nation's largest
sect. By police count, more than 1,000 people have been killed and
3,000 wounded in the clashes.

   Robert Olson was convicted of murder, armed robbery and assault
in the July 18, 1987, holdup of a gas station in Minneapolis in
which the station manager was shot to death. Olson was sentenced to
life in prison plus six years.
   He said he had been duped into driving the getaway car for the
crime.
   The Minnesota Supreme Court had overturned Olson's conviction
and granted him a new trial. Today's decision upheld the state
court ruling.
   Police, acting on an informant's tip, went to a home where they
believed Olson was staying with the two women who lived there.
After surrounding the home, police telephoned and asked to speak to
Olson. A male voice was heard to say, ``Tell them I left.''
   Police officers then rushed into the home, found Olson hiding in
a closet and arrested him. Olson made an incriminating remark to
police that was used against him at his trial.
   Today's decision means Olson must be retried, and that the
incriminating remark _ the result of an unlawful arrest _ cannot be
used as evidence.
   ``The issue is whether the arrest violated Olson's Fourth
Amendment rights. We hold that it did,'' White wrote.
   The Fourth Amendment bans unreasonable police searches and
arrests.
   White added: ``We stay in others' homes when we travel to a
strange city for business or pleasure, when we visit our children
or more distant relatives out of town, when we are in between jobs
or homes, or when we house-sit for a friend. We will all be hosts
and we will all be guests many times in our lives. From either
perspective, we think that society recognizes that a house guest
has a legitimate expectation of privacy in his host's home.''
   The court in 1980, invoking the phrase ``A man's home is his
castle,'' ruled that police almost always need warrants before
arresting people in their homes.
   Today's decision extends the reasoning of that 1980 decision to
house guests as well.

<HEAD>AIDS Virus Found in 1 in 3,000 Teens Applying for Military</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The AIDS virus was found in almost one in 3,000
teens who applied for the military over a 42-month period, with the
infection rate about equal among young women and men, researchers
reported today.
   ``The data presented in this study suggest that HIV is a real
and immediate threat to teenagers throughout the United States,''
the researchers from the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in
Washington, D.C., wrote in today's Journal of the American Medical
Association.
   The study looked at 1,141,164 teens applying to enlist in the
U.S. military between October 1985 and March 1989, all of whom were
tested for the human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS. Of
that number, 393 were HIV positive.
   Overall, 48 of 150,043 female applicants tested positive, or
.032 percent, and 345 of 991,455 males, or .035 percent, the
researchers said.
   But women aged 17 and 18 tested positive more often than their
male counterparts _ 28 of 102,576 women, or .027 percent, compared
with 177 of 763,872 men, or .023 percent _ an unusual phenomenon
among any age group. For example, the male-female ratio among
adults with full-blown AIDS is 9.3-1, the researchers said.
   The probable explanation, the researchers said, is that females
aged 17 and 18 ``are more likely to have older, infected sexual
partners than males.''
   The study found that results varied widely in different regions,
with the most populous states accounting, proportionately, for the
highest number of infected teen applicants.
   HIV prevalence was greatest among minorities from densely
populated counties, the study said.
   Fifty-two of the 90,821 teens who tried to enlist in California
tested HIV positive, followed by 45 of 62,244 in New York and 38 of
73,789 in Texas. Nine states _ Alaska, Colorado, Maine, Montana,
North Dakota, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, South Dakota and Wyoming
_ had no HIV-positive applicants, the study said.
   The researchers reported that the prevalance of HIV infection
among teen applicants appeared to decrease over the study period,
but cautioned that more research is needed to verify that finding.
   They urged greater educational efforts to stop the spread of HIV
and AIDS.
   The virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer.
   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,
and from pregnant women to their offspring.

   Oil and natural gas flowed normally into Lithuania
today, officials of the breakaway government said, despite threats
by Moscow to halt the supplies to curb the republic's independence
drive.
   Lithuanian officials said they had expected the Kremlin to begin
cutting oil and natural gas supplies early today to enforce Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's threatened economic embargo.
   Soviet troops were seen near a pumping station at an oil
refinery in northwestern Lithuania this morning, but there was no
change in the supply of fuel at the facility, according to a report
on Lithuanian television.
   Lithuania's energy minister said oil supplies were normal and he
had not been informed of any planned reductions.
   On Friday, Gorbachev threatened to impose an embargo of critical
supplies unless Lithuania rescinded within 48 hours several laws
meant to bolster its March 11 declaration of independence.
Lithuanian leaders have made no move to meet Gorbachev's demands,
but say they are willing to negotiate. Gorbachev refuses to meet
with them until they rescind their declaration of independence.
   President Bush said in Washington the United States was
considering ``appropriate responses'' if supplies were cut. But he
also said he did not want to damage superpower relations.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III today told the House Ways
and Means Committee that U.S. support for perestroika, Gorbachev's
economic reform program, was at risk.
   ``Our bilateral commercial contacts with the U.S.S.R. may be
more directly in their interest than in ours. And those contacts
are being put to risk by Soviet actions in Lithuania,'' Baker said.
   Lithuania's parliament, the Supreme Council, met today to forge
an official response to the Soviet leader, and they were still
debating the tone of the resolution into the afternoon, said Rita
Dapkus of the legislature's Information Office. Also under sharp
discussion was the composition of a delegation to send to Moscow,
she said.
   Worried Lithuanians flooded the Baltic republic's government
with phone calls and stocked up on fuel.
   Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis said he believed any
hardships would strengthen the republic's resolve to split from the
Soviet Union.
   Lithuanian gas officials received a telegram late Monday from
the acting general director of the Soviet Union's western gas
network saying natural gas supplies would be ``sharply reduced from
the 17th of April.''
   But Runya Kontouteite, a spokeswoman for the Supreme Council,
said by telephone that natural gas was flowing normally this
morning.
   She said that a check with the central pipeline duty officer
indicated there were no signs of any fall in the pipeline pressure.
   In addition, oil supplies were being received normally at a
major refinery in the town of Mazheikiai, which produces
high-octane gasoline for export, Kontouteite said.
   Lithuanian TV reported that residents saw Soviet troops in
several armored vehicles stopped for a time near a pumping station
at the Mazheikiai refinery, but there was no interruption of
service, said broadcaster Edwardas Potashinskas. The presence of
soldiers at the site was unusual, he added.
   Nearly all Western journalists were forced by the Soviet
government to leave Lithuania last month.
   Leonas Asmantas, minister of fuel and power engineering, told
Vilnius Radio that the supply of oil ``is normal'' and he had
received no official document from anyone informing him of a cutoff.
   Asmantas said he did not think the Soviet Union would take the
step of reducing oil supplies. ``Perhaps economic pressure will be
applied in some other forms but not in the supply of fuel,'' he was
reported as saying.
   Sales of gasoline to motorists have tripled this week as
residents reacted to the threat, but stocks were adequate and no
rationing was anticipated, Asmantas said.
   In his ultimatum Friday, Gorbachev said Moscow would demand hard
currency from Lithuania for materials the Soviet Union sells abroad
for convertible currency. Oil and gas, which Lithuania receives at
subsidized prices, are the Soviet Union's biggest earners of
foreign currency.
   Lithuanian officials were discussing shifting some oil and gas
from industrial production to use in homes and hospitals if the
cuts occur, but had not publicly discussed a conservation program.
   The republic uses 18.5 million cubic meters of natural gas a
day, including 1.1 million cubic meters for homes.
   The Kremlin forcibly annexed the three Baltic republics _
Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia _ in 1940. Estonia and Latvia also
seek to restore independence, but are moving more cautiously.
   Gorbachev says Lithuanian independence can be discussed only
within the framework of Soviet law.
   A law passed this month would let republics secede if they gain
approval of two-thirds of their residents in a referendum and wait
a maximum of five years.

<HEAD>Court Rules Lawyer Can Collect Big Part of Client's Award in
California Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court ruled today that a lawyer
who wins a civil rights case can collect a big chunk of a client's
award under an agreement made when the attorney was hired.
   By a 9-0 vote, the court ruled against a California man awarded
$2.12 million and then ordered to pay 40 percent of the judgment to
his lawyer.
   Justice Byron R. White, writing for the court, said federal
civil rights law permits such contingent-fee arrangements.
   The case stems from a federal lawsuit by Juan Francisco Venegas
against Long Beach police officers. Venegas won a suit in which he
said his murder conviction was based on perjured evidence.
   Venegas hired Michael Mitchell to represent him in the suit and
agreed to pay the lawyer 40 percent of any award he won.
   A federal court also awarded Mitchell $75,000 in legal fees, a
sum to be paid by the police officers.
   Mitchell and Venegas parted ways in 1986 when the lawyer asked
for an additional 10 percent of the judgment to represent Venegas
on appeal and Venegas refused.
   The lawyer then filed a court motion to place a lien on the
judgment to recover his 40 percent fee, or $406,000.
   A federal judge gave MItchell a partial victory, ruling he may
be entitled to the contingent fee but leaving the matter to a state
court to decide.
   Mitchell won a bigger victory before the 9th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals.
   The appeals court last year sent the case back to the federal
judge to reconsider the lawyer's bid to enforce a lien on the $2.12
million award.
   Today, the Supreme Court agreed with the 9th Circuit court that
under federal civil rights law, Mitchell is not limited to
court-awarded attorneys' fees when there is a contingency fee
agreement with a client.
   The case is Venegas vs. Mitchell, 88-1725.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers
throughout the country.
   April 14
   The Arizona Daily Star, Tucson, Ariz., on the tuna industry
pledge:
   Most of the U.S. tuna-canning industry celebrated Earth Day a
little early this year _ or else it moved to protect the tuna
market _ with its pledge not to buy tuna caught in fishing nets
that also catch or injure dolphins.
   The announcement ... by the nation's three largest tuna canners
_ owners of the Star-Kist, Chicken of the Sea and Bumble Bee brands
of tuna _ should prevent thousands of dolphins from dying in
fishermen's nets this year. ...
   But consumers can't live on the word of big business alone.
Congress must enact legislation to hold industry to its promise.
   It is not as if the tuna industry's change of heart was
motivated by environmental enlightenment. On the contrary; it was
consumer consciousness _ including a letter-writing campaign and
tuna boycott _ that moved the industry to crack down on fishing
practices deadly to dolphins. ...
   Under the recent announcement, called the most important step to
protect dolphins since the 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act, the
canning companies will rely on the reports of observers stationed
on board tuna fishing vessels for making decisions about whether to
buy a particular catch of tuna.
   American consumers should seek more than pledges from the
tuna-canning industry, however. Greenpeace urges monitoring to
ensure companies keep their promises about not supporting unsafe
fishing methods. It also wants Congress to pass legislation
introduced by Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., and Sen. Joe Biden,
D-Delaware, to create a tuna-can labeling system to identify
``dolphin unsafe'' tuna.
   The cost to consumers will be only a few additional cents per
can. It's a small price to pay to protect the sea mammal.

   The Bulletin, Bend, Ore., on AT&amp;T and Planned Parenthood:
   AT&amp;T, the communications giant, decided the other day to quit
giving money to Planned Parenthood. Directors of the foundation
which AT&amp;T supports should reconsider their decision.
   A spokesman for AT&amp;T admitted the foundation made its decision
because of pressure brought by ultra conservatives upset with
Planned Parenthood's involvement with the abortion issue.
   Not that AT&amp;T's funds went to finance abortions, or even to pay
Planned Parenthood employees to mention the operation. No. AT&amp;T's
money went to finance a program aimed at reducing the number of
unplanned pregnancies that seem to fall most frequently on the
nation's poorest, least educated teen-agers.
   AT&amp;T's decision to withdraw its support for a worthy program
based on the rantings of what it admits is a tiny minority poses a
serious threat for a whole variety of charitable organizations. If
an outfit as large as AT&amp;T ... can be bullied into submission by a
handful of nuts, what can be expected from smaller, less
well-heeled businesses? ...
   Its position on abortion aside, Planned Parenthood offers a
variety of valuable services. ... In an age of concern about the
Earth's booming population, it would be a shame to see the agency
lose that support.

   The Westerly (R.I.) Sun on double-hulled tankers:
   Conoco Inc., a Houston-based oil company, in one bold stroke is
proving the truth of two old adages, ``We can learn from our
mistakes,'' and ``An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.''
   Conoco (is) ordering two new oil tankers. But unlike the
single-hulled Exxon Valdez which, after running aground, dumped 11
million gallons of petroleum into Alaskan waters last year, these
new ships will have double hulls.
   The folks at Conoco are well aware that this type of
construction will increase the cost of their new seagoing
acquisitions by as much as 15 percent, somewhere into the $70
million to $90 million range.
   But they are also aware that a Coast Guard study has found that
if the Exxon Valdez had been of double-hull construction, its
petroleum loss after running aground would have been reduced by as
much as 60 percent.
   Truly, Conoco has learned from Exxon's experience and with what
has been learned is making a powerful statement that at sea and on
land it is better to prevent oil spills than clean up after them.

   Albuquerque (N.M.) Journal on cutting U.S. troop strength:
   With the pain and consternation at the Pentagon in the aftermath
of the outbreak of peace, it is difficult to distinguish trial
balloons from real plans among the resulting announcements and
leaks.
   Nonetheless, the disclosure that the Army proposes to cut troop
strength by 25 percent by 1997 is a reasonable strategy, if world
events stay on their trend toward peace.
   The Department of Defense should not be so quick, however, to
reduce strength in the Reserves and National Guard.
   The proposal is to reduce active duty personnel from 764,000 to
580,000 and Reserve and National Guard forces from 776,000 to
645,000.
   With a downsized regular Army, the strategic importance of a
reserve of trained and organized manpower takes on greater
importance.

   Grand Forks (N.D.) Herald on the legacy of the Vietnam War:
   The (Vietnam) war put a tarnish on our national nobility.
American policymakers couldn't convince Americans that the war was
right, and the rest of the world was equally doubtful. The
foundation of American moral leadership was cracked, and it hasn't
been completely repaired.
   Then, there were the thousands who first found political power
through opposition to the war. The Civil Rights movement had shown
the way, and the Free Speech Movement ... had trained new cadres.
   But it was the war that energized so many young people, that
brought them into the streets and later into the political process.
This politicization would have happened in any case, but the war
made it happen in a particular way, and that way has had a profound
influence on how today's world works.
   The years of that war _ the longest war in American history _
were years that molded the nation. We don't know yet just how.
   The war is a part of the nation's unfinished business _ the
divisiveness, the bitterness, the doubt, the grief. These all
remain. It is understanding and acceptance that still elude us. ...
   Perhaps, the longing for them in the nation's soul is as great
as the grief in the nation's heart and the doubt in the nation's
mind.

   Philadelphia Daily News on Lithuania:
   It would be quite a picture. The Seminole nation _ in full
tribal regalia _ pleads with Mikhail Gorbachev to pressure
President Bush for the return of their half of Florida, which the
white man stole.
   The photo op would be spectacular, but Gorbachev would never buy
it. Nor would he intervene if the people of California tried to
secede from the United States.
   Fortunately for all of us, President Bush has taken the same _
and proper _ position regarding independence movements within the
Soviet Union.
   Quietly and firmly, Bush makes it clear that the use of military
force to squelch the independence movements in places like
Lithuania, Estonia or Latvia would not sit well with Americans.
   But he refuses to repeat the mistakes of 1956, which saw the
Eisenhower administration seemingly supporting the Hungarian
revolution only to find itself helpless when the Soviet tanks
rolled into Hungary to crush the revolution. Some feel, even today,
that the anticipation of American intervention helped inspire that
uprising _ and the brutal Soviet overreaction.
   But 1990 is not 1956. Gorbachev has demonstrated in word and
deed that he wants to encourage peaceful and democratic change
throughout the Soviet spheres of influence. ...
   As they prepare for the arms control summit next month, Bush and
Gorbachev know it would be insanity to abolish one form of mass
destruction while inviting another form of carnage. Their cautious,
yet consistent, approach to the promotion of peaceful change is
encouraging, and deserves the support of everyone who wants the
process to continue.

   Los Angeles Daily News on Lech Walesa the politician:
   Solidarity Chairman Lech Walesa injected more excitement into
Eastern European politics ... when he bluntly ``confirmed'' his
interest in becoming president of Poland, in remarks attributed to
him by the official Polish news agency PAP. About 24 hours later,
however, Walesa executed a remarkable about-face, although he
didn't quite describe it that way.
   ``Today on radio and TV, I hear that Lech Walesa agreed to be
president. I didn't say so at all,'' Walesa insisted. ...
   Walesa has picked up a decidedly American political trait _ not
allowing himself to be pinned down about future plans.
   Walesa claimed that he had been ``cajoled'' into making a
statement about his presidential ambitions and was misunderstood.
``I simply did not guard my tongue enough somewhere,'' he said.
   Obviously, Walesa has developed another skill that American
politicians long have been famous for _ how to make excuses.

   Lawrence (Kan.) Journal-World on President Bush, broccoli and
Earth Day:
   It's an interesting commentary on American priorities, that a
recent survey showed President Bush's distaste for broccoli drew
six times more public attention than Earth Day.
   In the survey, conducted by The Times Mirror Center for the
People and The Press, 76 percent of the respondents correctly
identified the vegetable President Bush had refused to eat. By
contrast, only 13 percent knew that April 22 is being observed as
Earth Day to honor the environment.
   The broccoli story was humorous enough _ the president putting
his foot down like an unhappy schoolboy and Barbara Bush promising
to eat his share of the broccoli for him. But in significance, the
Bush and the broccoli stalk story pales in comparison to an event
such as Earth Day, which focuses on one of the world's greatest
challenges: preserving the environment.
   Perhaps the poll doesn't say anything about American priorities.
Perhaps the broccoli story just tickled people's funnybones. But
it's too bad that the nation's media and the people it serves can't
pay as much attention to the cutting of millions of trees in the
world's rain forest as it does to the cutting of a stalk of
broccoli for the president.

   The Daily Tribune, Wisconsin Rapids, Wis., on returning the
census forms:
   The (census) forms were mailed in March and were supposed to be
sent back by April 1, which was proclaimed Census Day.
   Well, two weeks later, the Census Bureau is saying that many
people haven't sent in their completed forms. ...
   Nationwide, the response rate is a dismal 57 percent. Census
officials are mobilizing their troops to go door to door to those
households that haven't responded.
   Let them come, you say?
   Well, consider this. The Census Bureau had hoped to get back 70
percent of the forms without begging in person. To send out census
workers door to door will cost an extra $10 million for each
percentage point below that 70 percent budgeted goal.
   That's a lot of money, and who is going to pay for it? Taxpayers.
   We're already going to pay a budgeted $2.5 billion for this head
count, which occurs every 10 years.
   There's no reason to add to the bill by being too lazy to fill
out the form and send it in.
   This census is very important. It will determine how much money
is distributed to states and local governments. And, it will
determine how many representatives we have in Congress.
   It's nothing to ignore. If you want as much money as your
municipality is entitled to, send in your form. You'll be saving
Uncle Sam the trouble and expense of having to come looking for you.

   The News-Leader, Springfield, Mo., on U.S. Supreme Court's
refusal to hear a case involving a school board ban on dancing in
Purdy, Mo.:
   Tradition lives in Purdy, where dancing is a sin to a majority.
   Now the tiny community of 928 residents and its school board are
free to continue a century-long tradition of banning social dances,
despite the hopes of a minority that school dances be permitted.
   The decision does nothing to explain the Supreme Court's
rationale. By simply refusing to hear the case, the court let stand
a 5-4 ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals in St. Louis late last
year.
   The lower court opinion rejected the argument that a ban on
dancing amounted to an endorsement of the fundamentalist views of
the majority in Purdy. ...
   Using the rationale of the appeals court and by its refusal to
grant a full hearing, the courts have delivered a powerful message
that leaves the majority to impose its beliefs _ however sincere
they may be _ on the minority. The minority of Purdy students and
their parents asked for nothing of the school board that would
infringe on the rights of any students. But the board, and now the
courts, did exactly that.

<HEAD>Leningrad Player Wins New York Open Chess Tournament</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Alexander Khalifman, a 24-year-old from
Leningrad, U.S.S.R., has won the 1990 New York Open Chess
Tournament, taking the $20,000 first prize.
   Khalifman, in his first tournament in the United States, was the
only one among 63 entrants in the prestigious international section
to score 7 points. The nine-round event ended Tuesday.
   The field included 32 grandmasters _ the highest title holders
in chess short of world champion _ and 21 international masters,
who are one level below grandmaster. Eleven countries were
represented in the competition at the Penta Hotel, where players
competed for a total purse of $48,600.
   Khalifman, an international master, clinched first place by
defeating 21-year-old Grandmaster Ferdinand Hellers of Sweden in a
46-move, five-hour game.
   ``He sacrificed a pawn, but it was a very unclear sacrifice,''
Khalifman said. ``I made some good moves and my chances became
better and better. My pawn advantage was enough to win.''
   Gata Kamsky, 15, of Brooklyn, who defected from the Soviet Union
with his father during last year's New York Open, tied with four
others for second place.
   Kamsky, Grandmaster Helgi Olafsson of Iceland, and Leningrad
International Masters Leonid Yudasin and Vladimir Epishin each
finished with 6{ points, one-half point behind Khalifman. They
earned $4,825 apiece.
   Competitors earn one point for each win and one-half point for
each draw.
   Khalifman, Kamsky, Yudasin and Epishin also each won an
international grandmaster norm, one of the achievements necessary
to win the grandmaster title.
   Kamsky, unlike the others, does not yet hold an international
title.
   Khalifman said he hopes the international chess federation next
month would grant him the grandmaster title, which he believes is
overdue.
   ``I already have four GM (grandmaster) results _ I am ready to
become a grandmaster,'' he said. It normally takes three norms to
qualify for the title.
   International Master Patrick Wolff of Belmont, Mass., also
earned a grandmaster norm. Wolff tied for sixth place with
Grandmasters Joel Benjamin of Brooklyn and Smbat Lputian of
Armenia. Each earned 6 points and earned $1,033.33.
   Former World Champion Mikhail Tal of Riga, Latvia, earned 5{
points and finished in a tie with 10 others for ninth place. Each
of them won $518.18. In Monday's penultimate round, Kamsky drew
loud applause from spectators in the otherwise silent ballroom as
he defeated Tal in 45 moves. Tal, who was competing in his first
New York tournament, held the world title in 1960-61.
   Former World Champion Anatoly Karpov, who will be challenging
World Champion Garri Kasparov for the world title in New York in
October, dropped by during the fourth round of the international
competition.

   A mental patient claiming to have a bomb hijacked
an Aeroflot jet to Lithuania on Wednesday and demanded to meet with
officials there, but he surrendered after the plane landed,
officials said.
   The Moscow man commandeered the Tu-134 while it was bound from
the Soviet capital to Leningrad with about 70 people aboard,
including some American tourists, news reports said.
   Lithuania's internal affairs minister, Marijonas Misiukonis,
said the hijacker wanted to help the republic by giving it the
government-owned plane. Lithuania is involved in a standoff with
the Kremlin over its declaration of independence March 11.
   ``Shortly after takeoff, he called the stewardess and claimed he
had an explosive device in his lap, and pointed to paper wrapped
around an object that he was holding tightly against himself,''
said Valery Akolsin, a spokesman for the Ministry of Civil Aviation.
   The official news agency Tass quoted the hijacker as saying:
``Either we fly to Vilnius or I blow up the aircraft. I belong to
the caste of immortals and have nothing to lose.''
   ``His request was complied with after the pilots consulted
authorities on the ground and obtained permission to land the plane
in Vilnius,'' Akolsin said. Vilnius is the capital of Lithuania.
   Tass said the hijacker, identified as Igor Kalugin, demanded
that a meeting be organized with an unidentifed aide to Lithuanian
President Vytautas Landsbergis.
   After the plane touched down it taxied to a remote section of
the airport. Authorities drove up to the jet, and Kalugin, still
clutching the parcel, surrendered, said a tower dispatcher quoted
by Vilnius Radio.
   Tass said he was taken into custody.
   Akolsin said Kalugin was a registered patient at a psychiatric
clinic in Moscow. Misiukonis also said Kalugin was registered in
Moscow as being mentally ill.
   Vilnius Radio reported that American, Japanese and Cuban
tourists were among the passengers. They were taken to a special
hall for foreigners at the airport while the jet was searched, the
dispatcher said.
   No explosives were found, and after about 90 minutes, the jet
resumed its journey to Leningrad, the aviation ministry spokesman
said.
   The radio said Kalugin, 46 or 47 years old, was an employee of a
Moscow theater and claimed to have acquaintances in Lithuania.
   Misiukonis told Vilnius Radio that Kalugin did not put up a
struggle when he was arrested and that no weapon was found.

   A strong earthquake struck a remote area near
China's northwestern border with the Soviet Union, the official
news agency said Wednesday, but no deaths or injuries were reported.
   The State Seismological Bureau said the quake Tuesday registered
6.4 on the Richter scale and hit West Wuqia in the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
   Zhu Lingren, deputy director of the Xinjiang regional seismic
bureau in Urumqi, said an investigative team had not reached the
affected area.
   West Wuqia is 60 miles from the Soviet border.
   The Richter scale gauges the energy released by an earthquake as
measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph. A quake of 6.4
could cause severe damage in a populated area.

   North Korea has tightened surveillance
of foreigners and students to keep word of reform in other
Communist countries from spreading, media reports said Wednesday.
   Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, quoted intelligence
sources as saying North Korea was closely watching about 2,000
foreign technicians, students and diplomats.
   North Korea has been maintaining a one-on-one surveillance
system for its college students who once studied in the Soviet bloc.
   Security officials have been stationed inside university
campuses since leaflets criticizing President Kim Il-sung were
found and a ``small-scale'' campus protest erupted in the capital
early this year, the agency said.

   Thousands of students shouting
anti-U.S. and anti-government slogans demonstrated Wednesday to
protest a recent political move that gave President Roh Tae-woo a
majority in the National Assembly.
   In Seoul, about 1,000 students at Konkuk University fought riot
police with rocks and firebombs. ``Let's destroy the merger!''
students yelled. ``Let's drive out the Yankees!''
   Riot police firing tear gas dispersed the protesters. There were
no arrests or injuries reported.
   Also Wednesday, more than 20,000 students staged peaceful street
protests at 19 campuses in Seoul and at colleges in Kwangju. They
were marking the anniversary of the April 19, 1960 student-led
civil uprising that toppled South Korea's first authoritarian
government.
   Thousands of riot troops were deployed to block violence.
   Protests reportedly erupted in other cities, but no overall
figures were immediately available. Traditionally, police do not
intervene in peaceful protests marking the anniversary.
   During Wednesday's protests, students demanded the immediate
withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea. They urged protests
against Roh's government and an end to U.S. influence in South
Korea.
   Radical students, a powerful minority, claim the merger in
January of Roh's party with two opposition groups into a giant
governing party was a premeditated scheme by conservatives to
prolong their power.
   They also accused Roh of ignoring popular wishes for political
and economic reforms.
   Roh has introduced broad reforms since he took office in
February 1988 and sent his authoritarian predecessor into rural
exile.
   Radical students demand the withdrawal of American soldiers from
the country, saying they prevent reunification of North and South
Korea.

   The bride shivered in the wind, a tuxedoed
accordionist played ``Hail to the Chief'' and a make-believe George
Bush arrived 20 minutes late to officiate Wednesday morning at a
gag wedding outside the Jefferson Memorial.
   The fake ceremony was staged by Gary Butler and his bride,
Marilou Brown _ who were married for real Tuesday night by a
suburban Fairfax County, Va., magistrate _ as a practical joke on
about 50 of their friends.
   The ``wedding'' guests gasped and then giggled as John Simmons,
a Bush look-alike from Washington's Gross National Product comedy
troupe, stepped from a white stretch limousine surrounded by phony
Secret Service agents in dark glasses, waved to the crowd and took
his place behind a flower-bedecked altar on the lawn.
   Over the roar of airplanes, helicopters and rush-hour traffic,
the Bush mimic announced he was playing minister to the couple as
``captain of the ship of democracy.''
   He called the newlyweds ``two points of light in this kinder and
gentile nation of ours'' and led them in the Pledge of Allegiance.
As Butler recited his vows, the bogus Bush advised the bride to
``read his lips.'' He wished them mutual fidelity in ``a perfectly
monotonous relationship.''
   It's the second marriage for Butler, 41, and the third for Ms.
Brown, 42. Both are bankers _ and Republicans _ who've been friends
and drinking buddies since they met seven years ago. Butler said
they decided to ``try something different, something novel'' this
time around, for their friends' amusement.
   Butler is an ardent admirer of Thomas Jefferson, the former
president. He and his new wife courted during evening strolls
around the floodlit Jefferson Memorial. ``It's very romantic,'' he
said.
   They decided to be married there, but the red tape of two
Virginia residents getting a wedding license in the District of
Columbia proved too much. So they were married privately in
Virginia and invited friends to a public ``wedding'' the next
morning at their favorite trysting place.
   ``We couldn't get Tom Jefferson to marry us, so we got the next
best thing, George Bush,'' said the bride.
   After Wednesday's reception, the Browns flew to a ski resort
near Salt Lake City to spend their honeymoon at a three-day
bankers' conference.

   The accused gunman in an alleged racial attack
repeatedly fired into the heart of his teen-age victim, a
prosecutor said in opening arguments today.
   The murder trial of Joseph Fama got under way today after a
one-day delay because his attorney was ill. Fama and the alleged
ringleader, Keith Mondello, are being tried together, but separate
juries are hearing the cases.
   The prosecutor said 16-year-old Yusuf Hawkins was shot and
killed after he was pursued by a mob and backed into a doorway.
   ``Joseph Fama took out that .32-caliber gun and fired it
repeatedly into the heart of Yusuf Hawkins,'' said assistant
district attorney Edward Boyar.
   Fama and Mondello, both 19, are charged with murder and other
crimes. If convicted, they face 25 years to life in prison. Opening
arguments in the trial of Mondello were delivered Monday.
   Hawkins was shot to death after he and three of his pals, all
black, crossed paths with a mob of mostly whites in Brooklyn's
Bensonhurst section. The four blacks had gone to look at a used car.
   On Tuesday, prosecutors showed jurors a videotape in which
Mondello admitted to being part of the gang but asserted that
racism played no role in the attack.
   ``No matter what color they were, if someone was coming to beat
my friends up we would do anything to protect ourselves,'' Mondello
said in a television interview taped five days after the Aug. 23
killing.
   Mondello said the gang gathered to battle a gang of blacks they
believed were coming to look for trouble in their neighborhood.
   ``I was told that 25 blacks were coming to beat me and my
friends up,'' he said. ``The only reason baseball bats were on the
scene was because we wanted to protect ourselves. And we didn't
know if they were going to be armed.''
   In the interview, Mondello denied knowing that one of the whites
was carrying a gun.
   Prosecutors played the taped interview, they said, to show
Mondello was a liar who had changed his account of the attack.
After his arrest, Mondello told investigators that before the
attack a man identified only as ``Frank'' put an object in his car
that Mondello soon learned was a gun.

   The Bush administration today again warned the
Soviet Union that its actions in Lithuania could disrupt relations
between the superpowers and hurt the restructuring of the Soviet
economy.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, testifying before the
House Ways and Means Committee, said U.S. support for perestroika
was at risk.
   After listing benefits he said the United States gets from
smoother ties with Moscow, Baker cautioned the Kremlin:
   ``Our bilateral commercial contacts with the U.S.S.R. may be
more directly in their interest than in ours. And those contacts
are being put to risk by Soviet actions in Lithuania.''
   The administration is providing no direct aid for the economic
reconstruction efforts of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
And, Baker stressed, ``We must avoid the siren song calling for
direct aid to Moscow.''
   The superpowers are negotiating a new trade agreement that could
open American markets more widely to Soviet exports by reducing
U.S. trade barriers.
   Baker did not specify which commercial ties could be harmed if
the Soviets suppress the independence movement in the Baltic
republic. But Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas and
others in Congress who have taken a hard line toward Moscow are
suggesting a suspension of the trade talks.
   The administration's cautious approach drew support from Rep.
Thomas Downey, D-N.Y., one of the most liberal members of Congress.
He said others ``would love an excuse to jump-start the Cold War.''
But the New Yorker told Baker, ``The measured response you have
given to date is going to prove to be the correct one in the long
sweep of history.''
   The Soviets evidently have not followed through on an
announcement that natural gas and other supplies to Lithuania would
be reduced. Lithuania's energy minister said today that oil
supplies were normal and that he had not been told of any planned
reductions.
   Likewise, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said
there was no sign of a cutoff.
   ``Essentially it's a matter of watching and waiting to see what
happens,'' he said.
   Fitzwater added, ``We've been going through this process now for
a month or two. There's all kinds of maneuvering going on back and
forth between the Soviet Union and Lithuania. Therefore we don't
try to spend a whole lot of time reading the tea leaves about what
might happen or they think is going to happen or so forth.''
   On Friday, Gorbachev threatened to impose an embargo of critical
supplies unless Lithuania rescinded within 48 hours several laws
meant to bolster its March 11 declaration of independence.
Lithuanian leaders have made no move to meet Gorbachev's demands,
but say they are willing to negotiate. Gorbachev refuses to meet
with them until they rescind their declaration of independence.
   Baker called on Moscow again to ``engage in a dialogue, and not
merely talk about having a dialogue'' with Lithuanian leaders. He
said dialogue, ``not economic boycotts or threats to invoke
presidential rule,'' would be the solution to the problem.
   Despite the warning, Baker said good relations with Moscow serve
U.S. interests in several ways, including arms control agreements
and working together on regional conflicts around the world.
   ``It's in our interest to lock in major reductions in Soviet
strategic forces and to create a more stable, predictable and
secure relationship that reduces the risk of nuclear war,'' he said.
   Committee chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., said how the
Soviets handle the situation in Lithuania ``will have a strong
bearing'' on U.S. economic policy toward Moscow.
   President Bush said Tuesday that he would take ``appropriate
responses'' if Moscow followed through on the threatened reduction
of fuel supplies. And yet, Bush showed a reluctance to move against
the Kremlin.
   ``I want to be sure anything we do is productive,'' he said.
``There's been dramatic change in the world and I don't want to
inadvertently take some action that would set it back.''
   The president gave no indication what options he might be
considering. Other U.S. officials told The Associated Press the
U.S. policy simply is to watch and wait and see what the Soviets
might do in Lithuania.
   These officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, questioned
that Moscow would cut gas supplies since the pipeline to Lithuania
goes on from there to Kaliningrad, a Soviet city.
   Senate Democratic Leader George Mitchell of Maine met Tuesday
with Bush at the White House and said afterward: ``I think it's a
very serious matter, a very serious, delicate situation.''

<HEAD>Lithuanians In Poland Worry and Hope For Families Across Border</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DRUSILLA MENAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PUNSK, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Had Josef Stalin's hand shaken a little,
this town might have been in Lithuania.
   But the postwar boundary between Poland and the Soviet republic
was drawn just to the east of Punsk, and thousands of ethnic
Lithuanians are today Polish citizens.
   Now this Lithuanian-speaking national minority _ by far the
majority in Punsk and the surrounding rolling farmland _ is on the
outside looking in as the independence-seeking republic faces down
Moscow.
   ``They are worried, scared, full of hope ... There is a lot of
concern here because of their families. They are praying a lot for
them,'' said the Rev. Ignacy Dziermiejko, the bilingual parish
priest who wears a little Lithuanian flag pinned to his cassock.
   Residents of Punsk put up Lithuanian and Polish flags after
watching the March 11 television broadcast when Lithuania's
parliament declared independence from Moscow.
   Tensions heightened April 3 when the Soviets, without warning,
shut the nearby border crossing between Poland and Lithuania, the
republic's only road into another country.
   For the Lithuanians in Poland, the border closing meant no more
visits with relatives on the other side, and an abrupt halt to
contacts eased less than three years ago when the border was opened.
   For four decades, the Communist regimes in Moscow and Warsaw
officially ignored the existence of the many ethnic minorities east
and west of the border. At times, they repressed the minorities'
efforts to maintain their own cultural, linguistic and religious
traditions.
   There are 260,000 ethnic Poles living in Lithuania, part of
which was Polish territory before World War II.
   About 5,000 ethnic Lithuanians make up 80 percent of the
population of Punsk, named for the Lithuanian word for a place for
hay. Another 5,000 live in the province, and there are an estimated
10,000 more ethnic Lithuanians spread across Poland.
   On a recent spring day, the bells at the 109-year-old Roman
Catholic church in Punsk rang out in support of Lithuania as
residents drafted a letter to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
and spread word of a planned weekend demonstration.
   Masses are still said in Lithuanian at the church in Punsk, and
Poland's only Lithuanian grammar school is here. The Baltic
Lithuanian language _ completely unrelated to Slavic Polish _ is
taught at the local high school.
   Poles and Lithuanians say they generally mix peacefully in this
tranquil rural region. They are less and less willing to be
manipulated, as they once were by governments exploiting ethnic
differences for political ends.
   Poles here express a healthy respect for the way the Lithuanians
``stick together'' to protect their interests.
   And the Lithuanians appreciate the relatively better life in
Poland, despite the country's considerable economic problems. For
Lithuanians crossing the border, said one, ``Poland is the West.''
   Both groups watch the events unfolding in Lithuania warily.
   To some in Poland, which last year became the first East bloc
country to have a non-Communist government, the tense confrontation
brings into question the Soviet government's resolve toward
introducing democratic reforms.
   ``Nothing has changed. It took three minutes to close the border
_ one phone call from Moscow,'' said Maciej Surel, a Polish
businessman in the nearby heavily Lithuanian town of Sejny.
   An exhibit of paintings by Andrzej Strumillo, a well-known
Polish artist of Lithuanian heritage, was turned back at the border
crossing April 4. The paintings were en route to the Lithuanian
city of Kaunas for a long-planned cultural exchange.
   ``It should be a warning to the United States that the Soviets
can break a bilateral agreement,'' said Strumillo, who paints at a
renovated farmhouse in Sejny.
   Strumillo's name shares a typically Lithuanian ending with that
of the legendary Lithuanian ruler Jagiello.
   Jagiello's 1386 marriage to a Polish princess led to a gradual
merger between Poland and Lithuania. But in 1795, when Poland was
partitioned, Lithuania came under the control of Czarist Russia.
   Poland and Lithuania both returned as independent states after
World War I. In 1920, Poland took the heavily Polish city of
Vilnius by force to earn the lasting bitterness of Lithuanian
patriots.
   Under the Hitler-Stalin pact, the Red Army swept through
Lithuania and eastern Poland after the Nazis invaded Poland in 1939.
   The post-World War II border placed much of eastern Poland
inside the Soviet Union and left Lithuania a Soviet republic.
   Under Gorbachev, the Soviets have officially disavowed the
Hitler-Stalin pact, but its effects remain.
   Some have questioned the Lithuanian drive for independence as a
too hasty challenge that could threaten the wider reforms advocated
by Gorbachev.
   But the Lithuanians of Punsk are ``with their whole hearts
behind independence,'' said the village leader, Romas Vitkauskas.
   ``The Soviet system has passed its time and it can't work
anymore. Change can't come from one person, Gorbachev, but other
places and people must be involved,'' he added.

   It didn't take fancy police work to find a
suspect in this shooting _ the victim identified his alleged
assailant as the man in the next hospital bed.
   Police said the incident happened early Tuesday while Howard
Felix, 20, was being treated for multiple gunshot wounds at the
emergency room of Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx.
   Another man who'd been shot, 20-year-old Anibal Aba Ad, was
brought in and placed on the gurney next to him, authorities said.
Felix took one look and said Ad was the man who shot him.
   Police arrested Ad and charged him with attempted murder,
assault and weapons possession, although he did not have a gun at
the time of his arrest.
   The circumstances of the shootings were unclear. Sgt. Norris
Hollomon, a police spokesman, said Ad claimed he was shot by
someone who pulled up in a car while he was standing on the street.
   Hollomon said Felix was not forthcoming with details about how
he was shot.
   Ad suffered fractured bones and a superficial abdominal injury;
Felix suffered damage to his liver, authorities said.

<HEAD>White House Stresses ``A Vote for All'' in South Africa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration on Wednesday stressed
its support for ``one man, one vote'' rule in South Africa after
new assertions by President F. W. de Klerk that his government
would not agree to majority rule.
   ``We support the achievement of a nonracial, democratic society
based on universal sufferage _ sufferage meaning a vote for all _
in a united South Africa,'' said White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater.
   De Klerk said in a speech in Cape Town on Tuesday that his
government would not agree to majority rule although was prepared
to work out a formula for whites to share power with blacks.
   South Africa's population includes 28 million blacks and 5
million whites. Blacks do not hold any seats in Parliament or on
major government policy-making bodies.
   ``Our effort is to support the one man, one vote rule,''
Fitzwater said.
   Fitzwater noted negotiations begin next month between de Klerk's
white-minority government and the anti-apartheid African National
Congress on forming a new governmental system.
   ``What's most important is that the process of negotiations
begin as soon as possible and lead to the creation of a non-racial
democracy based on universal sufferage for adult South Africans and
guaranteeing equal political, economic and social rights,''
Fitzwater said.
   ``They should have the vote, they should all have the vote,''
Fitzwater said. ``Our interest is in getting the democracy and the
vote, and allowing them to determine their own government.''
   He stopped short of criticizing de Klerk, noting the South
African president in the same speech had ``accepted the principles
of universal franchise in which the vote of every adult citizen
would have equal value.''
   In a speech to Parliament, de Klerk said his government will
propose power-sharing for blacks and whites. However, he said other
steps would be taken to ensure that white domination will not be
replaced with black domination.
   Bush has invited both de Klerk and Nelson Mandela, the African
National Congress leader, to Washington for separate meetings.
Fitzwater said that dates have not yet been set for either meeting.

   A bill introduced in Congress Wednesday calls
for the government to spend $350 million over three years to
develop a magnetic levitation system that would whisk passengers
between major U.S. cities at 300 mph.
   The system, planned as a U.S. improvement on ``maglev''
transportation concepts being developed in Germany and Japan, could
eventually compete with railroads and airlines by running on
elevated tracks alongside interstate highways, said Rep. Robert J.
Mrazek, D-N.Y.
   He said ``maglev'' represents a kind of bold approach to
national transportation needs that was missing from the national
transportation policy laid out by Transportation Secretary Samuel
Skinner earlier this year.
   Skinner proposed $6.1 million to study the electrically powered
system which uses magnets to float cars several inches above the
track bed.
   Mrazek said that wouldn't be enough to compete with systems
being developed abroad based on U.S. technology.
   He said a U.S. system would help provide work for defense
contractors who will be affected by expected restraint in defense
spending.
   ``If we don't jump start it now, then it will be too late,``
Mrazek told a news conference. If the government doesn't step in
and help, he said, communities will turn to foreign manufacturers
for what will be a major new mode of transportation.
   Mrazek said the Japanese and Germany governments have invested
$1 billion each in development of their systems.

   States may outlaw all possession and viewing
of child pornography _ even in one's own home, the Supreme Court
ruled today.
   By a 6-3 vote, the court upheld an Ohio law that makes it a
crime to possess so-called kiddie porn. The decision extends a 1982
ruling in which the justices said production and distribution of
sexual depictions of children can be outlawed.
   The justices had been told the Ohio law is the toughest kiddie
porn legislation in the nation.
   Nonetheless, the court on narrower grounds struck down the
conviction of Clyde Osborne of Columbus.
   The justices said the jury was not instructed properly. They
ordered a new trial for Osborne, who had been sentenced to six
months in prison and fined $100 for possessing nude photos of a boy
believed to be 13 or 14.
   The case pitted the sanctity of the home against the safety and
welfare of children.
   Justice Byron R. White, writing for the court, said Ohio
legitimately seeks to ``destroy a market for the exploitative use
of children'' by making possession of child pornography a crime.
   ``Given the importance of the state's interest in protecting the
victims of child pornography, we cannot fault Ohio for attempting
to stamp out this vice at all levels in the distribution chain,''
he said.
   White also said Ohio's law is not too broad because it
specifically forbids possession of lewd material or material that
focuses on genitals.
   A prosecution could not be based on possession of innocuous
photos of one's children wearing no clothes, he said.
   White was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Harry A. Blackmun, Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and
Anthony M. Kennedy.
   In a dissenting opinion, Justice William J. Brennan said the
court is sacrificing privacy rights in its zeal to crack down on
child pornography.
   ``At bottom, the court today is so disquieted by the possible
exploitation of children in the production of the pornography that
it is willing to tolerate the imposition of criminal penalties for
simple possession,'' he said.
   ``Mr. Osborne's pictures may be distasteful, but the
Constitution guarantees both his right to possess them privately
and his right to avoid punishment under an overbroad law.''
   Joining Brennan's opinion were Justices Thurgood Marshall and
John Paul Stevens.
   The court for over 30 years has allowed states to outlaw the
sale and distribution of obscenity, ruling in a series of cases
that obscene material is not constitutionally protected.
   But the court in 1969 barred states from outlawing the mere
at-home possession of obscene materials.
   The court in 1982 carved out its newest exception to free-speech
rights. It let states outlaw material depicting children in sexual
performances or poses _ even if not obscene.
   Today, the court said the at-home possession of kiddie porn is
not entitled to the same protection given to at-home possession of
obscenity depicting adults.
   Osborne was 61 when he was prosecuted in 1985 for possessing the
nude photos of a youngster. Prosecutors said Osborne got the
pictures from a Florida mail-order business, and had placed them in
a photo album in his home.
   The photos were discovered after police searched Osborne's home
on a tip that he had bought the material.
   Ohio's law bans possession or viewing of ``any material or
performance that shows a minor ... in a state of nudity.''
Exemptions were included for parents and, among other things, for
photos with an artistic, medical or scientific purpose.
   In upholding Osborne's conviction, the Ohio Supreme Court
narrowed the law's ban to possession of ``lewd'' depictions of
children under 18.
   When Osborne's case was argued before the high court last
December, Columbus City Attorney Ronald J. O'Brien urged the court
to let authorities attack kiddie porn by making possession a crime.
   ``Child pornography has been driven underground'' by the court's
1982 ruling, O'Brien said then. ``Because it's underground, the
additional tool of having a possession offense is necessary.''
   O'Brien and Osborne's lawyer, public defender S. Adele Shank,
disagreed in December over how many other states have similar laws.
   O'Brien told the justices that 18 other states have similar
kiddie porn laws. They are Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Florida,
Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska,
Nevada, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington and West
Virginia.
   But Ms. Shank, calling Ohio's law the broadest in the country,

<TEXT>
   Inmates in Sofia's central prison on
Wednesday rejected an accord reached with the government and
opposition officials and continued a rooftop protest for a second
day.
   Prisons in other cities reported similar disruptions Wednesday,
penal officials said on condition of anonymity.
   Inmates at the Sofia facility began their protest Tuesday. They
issued a list of demands, which included revising sentences deemed
unjust, shortening pre-trial investigations, and improving prison
conditions.
   It was not immediately clear how the protest began.
   About 30 inmates initially climbed onto the prison roof to
underscore their grievances. Some threatened to commit suicide if
their demands were not met.
   ``Every third day, one of us will jump from the roof!'' one
prisoner shouted Tuesday, the opposition daily Demokratisya
reported.
   Two inmates from the Sofia jail were hospitalized after trying
to set themselves afire. Their conditions were not serious, the
officials said.
   About 80 prisoners had climbed to the prison roof by late
Wednesday, officials said. An undetermined number of prisoners
barricaded themselves in their cells, they said. It was not known
how many inmates the facility holds.
   Officials said most inmates participating in the protest were
drug addicts or suffered from mental disorders.
   Representatives of the prisoners reached an agreement with the
government and leaders of the opposition Union of Democratic
Forces, the main umbrella group of opposition parties.
   But the prisoners rejected the deal Wednesday, accusing fellow
inmates of having betrayed them. They decided to return to the roof
of the building rather than stay in their cells, the officials said.
   Details of the accord were not immediately available.
   Prison officials said the protesters had caused damage estimated
at $10,000.
   On Wednesday, the protest spread to prisons in Varna, the
nation's largest seaport. Protests also were reported in the cities
of Plovdiv, about 100 miles southeast of Sofia, and Vraca, 60 miles
north of the capital, penal officials said.
   In Varna, about 15 inmates scaled the prison roof. No details of
the other protests were immediately available.

<TEXT>
   Authorities today filed a murder charge
against a 14-year-old girl who left her newborn baby in the woods.
The girl's 15-year-old brother _ allegedly the baby's father _ has
been charged with rape.
   ``After 42 years in law enforcement, I thought I had seen
everything,'' said Rowan County Sheriff Bob Martin.
   ``But I swear, this ... it's the worst one I've ever seen. That
baby lived three or four days without food.''
   The baby girl's dismembered body was discovered near the woods
on Monday, two weeks after her birth. The time and cause of death
had not been determined.
   Rowan County sheriff's Capt. Rick Thibodeau said the mother was
charged with second-degree murder and was in the custody of the
county Department of Social Services.
   He said her name would be withheld unless the district
attorney's office decides she should be bound over as an adult.
   The girl told authorities the baby was fathered by her brother,
who was charged Tuesday with second-degree forcible rape.
   The brother, whose name also was withheld, was being held in a
juvenile detention center in Forsyth County, which encompasses
Winston-Salem, Martin said. He is to appear later this week in
juvenile court, when it will be decided whether he will be bound
over to Superior Court and tried as an adult, authorities said.
   The child was born about 2:30 a.m. on April 2. The mother told
the sheriff's office that she gave birth in the kitchen of her
home, cut the umbilical cord with a knife, wrapped the baby in a
sheet and took her to the nearby woods, where she covered the child
with leaves.
   The girl said she went to school on April 3 and checked on the
baby later, finding her moving, breathing and crying a little,
according to Martin. She told authorities that she did not check on
the baby again.
   On Monday morning, 13-year-old Mistie Dawn Trexler looked out
the window of her mobile home and saw her uncle's dog carrying what
she said looked like a doll. It was the baby's body, without arms
or a lower torso.
   Investigators and neighbors stood silently as emergency
personnel placed the remains into a white adult-sized body bag,
carefully folding it down to size.
   Martin said the social services department helped lead them to
the baby's mother later Monday. The girl's own mother accompanied
her daughter to the sheriff's office, where the girl gave her
statement.
   ``DSS had been trying to get the expectant mother some help,''
Martin said. ``But the teen's mother kept denying her daughter was
pregnant.''
   Martin said an autopsy would determine the time and cause of the
baby's death.

Facility</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Greenpeace activists today bolted a
steel box containing a member of the environmental group to
railroad tracks leading to a Du Pont Co. facility to protest
production of ozone-depleting chemicals.
   Railroad workers removed the box about three hours later, after
digging and using a crane to lift the box off the tracks, said a
Greenpeace spokeswoman. She said the man in the box was arrested by
the San Patricio County Sheriff's Department.
   Greenpeace staged similar protests today at railroad lines
leading to Du Pont plants in Antioch, Calif., and Deepwater, N.J.,
she said.
   ``The point is that Du Pont is continuing to manufacture
ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbons, despite the fact that
scientific evidence from NASA, the EPA and the British Antarctic
survey show we need to have a phaseout of these toxic chemicals,''
said Julie Brenegar of Greenpeace.
   A 23-year-old Greenpeace official from Austin entered the 4- by
5-foot steel box, which was bolted to the tracks about one-quarter
mile from the plant at 7:05 a.m., Ms. Brenegar said.
   The Du Pont plant manager, Mack McCluskey, said he was surprised
by the protest, considering the company's efforts to phase out CFCs
by the year 2000 and its plans to make ``alternative freon''
products.
   Greenpeace says the Ingleside plant manufactures
chlorofluorocarbons that are used as industrial solvents. Chlorine
molecules of these compounds have been associated with depletion of
the earth's ozone layer, which protects life on the surface from
the ultraviolet radiation of the sun.

<TEXT>
   Major universities are warning the Pentagon
that a military policy barring homosexuals from service is
generating pressure to oust ROTC from campuses.
   ``The contradiction between the university's principle of
non-discrimination against individuals on the basis of sexual
orientation, and the presence of an ROTC that does discriminate,
cannot exist on the campuses indefinitely,'' John M. Deutch,
provost of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said in a
letter to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
   ``Many universities will withdraw from the ROTC program,''
Deutch wrote.
   The Department of Defense has declined to comment on the campus
pressure.
   Maj. Doug Hart said that because the policy is being challenged
in court the department has limited responses to a written
statement outlining the reasons for barring homosexuals.
   The military contends that homosexuality is incompatible with
military service because of the close quarters in which people of
the same sex must live and because of the security risk posed by
the possibility of a homosexual officer being blackmailed.
   Top administrators, faculty groups and students from MIT, the
University of Wisconsin, University of Minnesota, Northwestern
University and others have actively campaigned against the Reserve
Officer Training Corps policy.
   No ROTC program has been removed from a campus as a result of
the opposition.
   The ROTC, in the past year, has denied several gay cadets their
officer's commission and sought repayment of thousands of dollars
in scholarship money.
   Until recently, gay men and lesbians have been on their own in
fighting the Pentagon policy.
   One such student, Robert Bettiker, was one semester from
graduation at MIT when he old his superior that he was gay.
Bettiker was denied his commission and asked to repay $38,612 in
scholarship money.
   The growing concern among university officials confronts the
Department of Defense for the first time with institutional
opposition to the policy.
   In many instances, the opposition stems from explicit
anti-discriminatory provisions in university charters. Wisconsin
has a state law barring discrimination against homosexuals.
   The University of Wisconsin faculty senate voted in December to
expel ROTC from campus because of its policy on homosexuals. The
university regents refused to accept that proposal but told
President Kenneth Shaw to lobby the state congressional delegation,
which includes House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin, a
Democrat.
   ``We want to see the law changed,'' Shaw said in a telephone
interview. ``We're not interested in getting out of ROTC.''
   Shaw said that Aspin was ``supportive but not optimistic'' that
Congress could pass a law overriding the Pentagon policy.
   At Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., an ad hoc student
group called for the removal of the campus ROTC program and the
student government organization voted to ban the program from using
university facilities and funds. Neither recommendation was
accepted by the administration.
   A faculty group at the University of Minnesota urged
administrators to lobby Washington lawmakers to change the policy.
   ``We really shouldn't be standing for discrimination at any
level,'' said Dick Caldecott, the university's liaison for federal
relations.
   At Washington University in St. Louis, where gay ROTC cadet
James Holobaugh is being asked to repay his scholarship, a student
referendum to remove ROTC was defeated. However, the provost has
written ROTC officials complaining about the policy.
   The concern by MIT is particularly significant because of the
institute's longstanding relationship with the Pentagon. MIT
receives substantial research grants from the government for
projects with military applications.
   ``One unfortunate consequence of this policy is to increase
hostility to the DOD on university campuses,'' Deutch said in his
letter to Cheney.
   The ROTC includes 86,000 students at 529 campus locations. About
21,700 students receive ROTC scholarships, which pay for tuition,
books and fees, Hart said.

<HEAD>Psoriasis Treatment Linked with Genital Cancer in Men</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For release at 6 p.m. EDT</NOTE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ultraviolet light treatment that is widely used to
clear up psoriasis can dramatically increase the risk of rare
genital cancer in men, a study has found.
   Those who get high doses of the treatment, known as PUVA, face
300 times the usual risk of squamous cell cancer of the penis and
scrotum.
   The research suggests that men exposed to any source of
ultraviolet light, including tanning booths, should protect their
genitals from the rays.
   PUVA _ short for psoralen and ultraviolet A _ has been used
since the early 1970s to treat severe psoriasis. Patients take
pills that are activated inside their bodies by exposure to intense
ultraviolet A.
   While the treatment is highly effective, it increases the risk
of skin cancer. The latest study suggests that men's genitals are
especially susceptible to this unwanted side effect.
   The increased risk ``makes it prudent for men to use genital
protection whenever they are exposed to PUVA or other forms of
ultraviolet radiation for therapeutic, recreational or cosmetic
reasons,'' the researchers wrote.
   They noted that tens of thousands of Americans receive PUVA or
ultraviolet B therapy for treatment of skin disease, and more than
1 million get ultraviolet radiation from tanning devices.
   The study, directed by Dr. Robert S. Stern of Boston's Beth
Israel Hospital, was published in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine.
   The doctors based their conclusions on a 12-year follow up of
892 men who received PUVA for psoriasis that typically covered
one-third of their bodies. Fourteen of the men, or just under 2
percent, developed genital cancers. Among those with high PUVA
exposure, 6 percent got this kind of cancer.
   The men were five to 15 times more likely to develop cancers on
their genitals than on other parts of their bodies.
   Because patients stand during therapy, men's genitals are
exposed to the light rays, but women's are not. Only one cancer of
the external genitals occurred among 488 women in the study.
   Dr. John H. Epstein of the University of California, San
Francisco, said the results indicated that ``the male genitalia
should be completely protected during PUVA and ultraviolet B
therapy if they are not involved with psoriasis, and they should
receive a reduced dose if they are.''

<TEXT>
   A study supports the widely held belief that poor
patients are more expensive for hospitals to treat than are more
affluent people.
   Although earlier research has come to conflicting conclusions on
the point, the Medicare program already pays more to hospitals that
take care of large numbers of poor people.
   In a study published in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine, doctors reviewed the cases of 16,908 people admitted to
five Massachusetts hospitals in 1987.
   Poor patients remained hospitalized 3 percent to 30 percent
longer than better-off patients, depending on the hospital, and
their bills were 1 percent to 18 percent higher.
   The researchers said their work suggests that all hospitals _
not just those with large numbers _ should get extra payments for
their poor patients.
   The Medicare program pays flat fees for specific illnesses. But
it does not give hospitals more money if patients are unusually
sick and need longer stays.
   The study was directed by Dr. Arnold M. Epstein of Brigham and
Women's Hospital in Boston. The researchers did not attempt to
learn why the poor needed to stay in the hospital longer.

<HEAD>New Drug Effective Against Rare Form of Leukemia</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For release at 6 p.m. EDT</NOTE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An experimental cancer drug that works after a
single round of treatment appears to be the most effective medicine
yet for a rare form of leukemia, according to a study.
   The drug _ called 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, or 2-CdA _ has
produced complete remissions in almost all hairy cell leukemia
patients treated, and none has relapsed so far.
   Researchers who developed and tested the medicine report that it
``may well be the drug of choice in the treatment of hairy cell
leukemia.''
   The drug also has been used successfully against chronic
lymphocytic leukemia. It, like hairy cell leukemia, is a cancer of
the white blood cells, which produce disease-fighting antibodies.
   The latest study, published in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine, was directed by Dr. Lawrence D. Piro of the Scripps
Clinic and Research Foundation in La Jolla, Calif. Scripps recently
made an agreement with Johnson &amp; Johnson's Ortho Pharmaceuticals to
produce and distribute the drug once it's approved by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration.
   In the published work, doctors gave the drug to 12 patients as
far back as four years ago. In 11, the disease disappeared and they
remain disease free.
   In all, the Scripps doctors have treated 24 patients with almost
complete success. However, they caution that longer follow up will
be necessary before they can be sure they have actually cured the
disease.
   Two other treatments for hairy cell leukemia have been developed
in recent years. They are interferon and deoxycoformycin, a drug
that is similar to 2-CdA. However, interferon is less effective,
and both of those treatments produce serious side effects.
   By contrast, the only unwanted effect of 2-CdA was a few days of
fever. Patients experienced no nausea, hair loss, rashes or other
symptoms typical of cancer therapy. Also unlike other treatments,
this one appears to work after a single seven-day course of therapy.

   Kidnappers holding three American
professors said today they would release one within 48 hours as a
goodwill gesture and that the freed hostage would carry a message
for President Bush.
   The Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine also
threatened to ``escalate'' its actions unless the release is
followed by an unspecified reciprocal response by the United States.
   The group demanded that U.S. assistant Secretary of State for
Near Eastern affairs, John Kelly, fly to the Syrian capital,
Damascus, within the same period.
   ``The arrangements for the release should be accomplished by the
arrival of John Kelly in Damascus to coordinate some final steps to
guarantee success within 48 hours,'' the handwritten statement
said. Kelly is a former U.S. ambassador to Lebanon.
   In Washington, a White House official said: ``We've seen the
reports. We're not commenting on them.''
   ``Of course, we would welcome the release. Beyond that, we don't
think it would be useful to speculate on anything,'' said the
official, who asked not to be identified.
   The State Department said it had no immediate comment, and a
spokesman refused to discuss Kelly's whereabouts when asked if he
would travel to Syria.
   The kidnappers' statement was delivered to the independent
Beirut newspaper An-Nahar and a Western news agency in Beirut along
with an instant picture of kidnapped educator Jesse Turner, one of
18 Western hostages held in Lebanon.
   Turner, 42, was abducted along with professors Alann Steen, 50,
and Robert Polhill, 55, from the campus of the U.S.-affiliated
Beirut University College by gunmen posing as riot police on Jan.
24, 1987.
   The Arabic-language statement did not say which of the three
would be freed. It came four days before Steen marks his fourth
birthday in captivity.
   A fourth professor kidnapped with them, Indian Mithileshwar
Singh, was freed Oct. 3, 1988. He held an American residence permit.
   Turner's mother, Estelle Ronnenburg of Boise, Idaho, told The
Associated Press today that she had spoken with U.S. government
officials.
   ``I do feel full of hope, but I talked to the State Department
and they told me that they are checking things out and not to let
myself get too worked up because we have had rumors like this
before that have not worked out so we want to be sure it's going to
work out before we get too hopeful.''
   The kidnappers' statement said the decision to release a U.S.
hostage came in response to behests from Iran and Syria, adding:
   ``We have decided to move the hostages affair forward by
releasing an American hostage within 48 hours on the basis of
reciprocal moves to accomplish what is required to accelerate the
happy ending.
   ``We want the humanitarian move to be balanced between both
sides. This is a condition to move forward. Otherwise, there is no
meaning for a one-sided movement.''
   ``We have responded to the behests, hoping to reach a solution
as proposed and on the basis of the verbal message that will be
conveyed to President Bush. We are ready to reciprocate or
escalate. The other side has to choose.''
   The statement appeared to indicate that an exchange was involved
in the release and that the hostage would be carrying a message to
President Bush.
   The group previously had offered to trade the three American
hostages for 400 Arab inmates held in Israeli jails. Israel
rejected the offer.
   Iranian newspapers associated with Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani have urged that the Western hostages be released on
humanitarian grounds. More radical elements in Iran have said
holding the hostages was a means of confronting the West.
   The Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine was last heard
from March 15 when it threatened to kill the three Americans unless
the United States met its unspecified demands. It also threatened
to attack airlines carrying Israeli emigrants from the Soviet Union
to Israel.
   That statement was accompanied by a photograph of Steen.
   The group is comprised of Shiite Moslem zealonts loyal to Iran.
   There are 18 Westerners held hostage in Lebanon, including eight
Americans, four Britons, two West Germans, two Swiss, an Italian
and an Irishman. Most are held by pro-Iranian groups.
   The longest-held hostage is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   Earlier today, friends and relatives of kidnapped British
journalist John McCarthy addressed messages to him and to his
captors that pleaded for information on his whereabouts.
   The messages, in Arabic and English, were published by the
leftist Beirut As-Safir newspaper as a paid advertisement, just a
day after McCarthy started his fifth year as a hostage.
   The advertisement could not have been published Tuesday because
Beirut newspapers did not publish that day, which fell during
Easter vacation.

   Thousands joined picket lines today in the
third day of a teacher protest against the Legislature's failure to
pass a $230 million education package that includes pay raises.
   ``It is definitely growing,'' Oklahoma Education Association
president Kyle Dahlem said. ``It's incredible the broad support
from the teachers, parents and children. I'm at a loss for words.''
   Estimates of the number of people participating in the
demonstration, spread over a large area around the Capitol, ranged
from 12,000 to 18,000.
   The association said it knew of 125 districts where schools were
closed by the teacher walkout that began Monday.
   ``We're hearing from more and more schools that are going to be
closed the rest of the week,'' state Education Secretary Sandy
Garrett said Tuesday.
   The Oklahoma Education Association, the union that called the
walkout, said about 20,000 teachers, or 60 percent of the state
teaching force, were off the job Tuesday. That's about 4,000 more
than the first day of the strike.
   Ms. Garrett estimated the walkout has affected about 60 percent,
or 343,200, of the state's 572,000 students.
   Teachers are venting their frustration over the Legislature's
failure after an eight-month special session to enact a $230
million school reform and tax plan that contains money for teacher
raises.
   The package would raise sales and personal and corporate taxes.
It mandates $1,500-per-year increases in teachers' minimum salary
for four years, eventually boosting that from the present $15,000 a
year to about $24,000.
   Despite support from Republican Gov. Henry Bellmon, the bill
stalled last week over opposition to the tax increases.
   The union says Oklahoma teachers rank 48th in teacher pay among
the states, making an average $22,000 a year compared with a
national average of $29,648.
   Officials in Oklahoma City and at least five other
municipalities decided Tuesday to close schools later this week so
their teachers can join picket lines.
   The announcement that Oklahoma City schools would close Thursday
brought cheers from pickets at the Capitol, where 8,000 to 10,000
people protested.
   Oklahoma City, with about 2,200 teachers, is the state's
second-largest district, behind Tulsa. Another union, the American
Federation of Teachers, represents about 1,000 teachers in Oklahoma
City, and union officials had advised its members not to
participate in the walkout without permission from the
administration.
   In Tulsa, Superintendent Bruce Howell canceled classes for the
rest of the week because of the prospect of ``an emergency
jeopardizing the health and safety of children.'' Initially, Tulsa
schools were to close only Monday and Tuesday.
   The union claims 31,000 of Oklahoma's roughly 35,000 teachers.

<HEAD>Police Arrest White Soldiers, Seek Another in Weapons Theft</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURINDA KEYS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police arrested three white
soldiers and are seeking an official of a white supremacist group
in connection with the theft of weapons from an air force armory,
officials said Wednesday.
   Piet Rudolph, deputy leader of the ultra-right Boerestaat (Boers
State) Party, is being sought for questioning in connection with
the Easter weekend robbery, police spokesman Col. Steve van Rooyen
said. The weapons were taken from a safe at air force headquarters
in Pretoria,
   Rudolph, a former member of the Pretoria City Council, already
faces a court appearance April 28 in connection with shots fired at
a Pretoria savings and loan association branch in December.
   Police Commissioner Johan van der Merwe said three National
Servicemen _ white soldiers serving their two-year mandatory
military service _ have been held since the theft was discovered.
   He said the weaponry _ including pump-action shotguns, assault
rifles, a light machinegun, pistols and ammunition _ had not been
recovered. He would not say how many weapons were stolen or give
other details.
   Police spokesman Maj. Gen. Herman Stadler described the theft as
an apparent ``inside job.'' Several newspapers quoted police as
saying the burglars gained access to the weapons safe with
duplicate keys.
   The Boerestaat Party believes whites are superior to blacks and
should live in separate nations. It also believes whites have a
right to use violence to retain their dominance under the current
South African constitution.
   The party was banned in 1987 by former President P.W. Botha when
he outlawed 17 anti-apartheid organizations.
   President F.W. de Klerk re-legalized the group in February along
with 59 other organizations, most of them black.
   He also lifted Botha's banning order, which had kept Boerestaat
Party leader Robert van Tonder from political activities or
speaking publicly.
   Far right-wing parties have called de Klerk a traitor for
legalizing the African National Congress, freeing Nelson Mandela
from prison, and promising to negotiate a new constitution ending
white rule and apartheid.
   In a speech for delivery late Wednesday in Krugersdorp, van
Tonder said de Klerk's promise to submit a new constitution to a
referendum was merely a way to ``democratically and
constitutionally'' destroy right-wingers.
   Van Tonder said the ultra-right could never achieve a majority
at the polls to defeat a new constitution. He said right-wingers
would have to find alternative means to get rid of the National
Party government.
   ``De Klerk is leading the Republic of South Africa toward a
civil war and leaves the Boere (Afrikaners) and other right-wing
people with no other option but to use violence to keep their
land,'' he said.
   De Klerk sharply criticized the right-wing in a speech to
Parliament on Tuesday, saying it was encouraging a ``psychosis of
violence.'' He also called on ANC leaders to stop ``preaching the
armed struggle.''
   Senior ANC officials are expected to arrive in South Africa on
April 28 to prepare for preliminary talks with the government May
2. The talks are to pave the way for formal negotiations between
blacks and whites on changing the constitution.

   As surely as a tree grows in Brooklyn, a
``Bonfire'' burns in the Bronx.
   Workers at the Bronx County criminal courthouse may glimpse Tom
Hanks, Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, Melanie Griffith and other
celebrities as their environs get filmed for the celluloid version
of ``The Bonfire of the Vanities.''
   The actors have already shot some Manhattan exteriors for the
film based on Tom Wolfe's best-selling novel, but filming goes in
high gear when it moves to the Bronx on Monday. Warner Bros.
received a special three-day permit to film key scenes at the
neo-Grecian limestone courthouse.
   The courthouse and its denizens play a prominent role in the
book, Wolfe's sardonic depiction of the lowlifes of New York high
society and the worms in the Big Apple's judicial system. Hanks
plays the lead role of Sherman McCoy, the Wall Street hotshot
ground up and spit out by the New York legal system.
   To add ``realism,'' the film crew will plaster one wall of the
spotless nine-story, three-block-long building with phony graffiti,
sources told the Daily News.

reasons he and his wife have decided to make St. Petersburg their
winter retirement home.
   ``I think that the climate of Florida is very attractive to
older people. Believe me, it gets more so every year,'' the
83-year-old author said Tuesday.
   Michener, who bought a summer residence in Brunswick, Maine,
last fall, said he will spend May through early October there and
February through mid-May at the University of Texas assisting with
classes, as he has done in recent years. He will live in St.
Petersburg from mid-October to early February and assist with

   Michener, whose works include ``Hawaii,'' ``Chesapeake,''
``Centennial,'' ``Texas'' and his most recent, ``Caribbean,'' said
he plans to write every day but will concentrate on articles and

   Imprisoned soul singer James Brown said
Wednesday he turned down hundreds of work-release jobs, including
some on radio and television, to counsel youths about drug abuse.
   ``I hope that together that we can bring a turnaround to some of
the problems that we have out there and make the people aware that
there is a place to go to get the help,'' Brown said at a news
conference.
   The two-time Grammy award winner was transferred last week from
the State Park Correctional Center in Columbia to the
minimum-security Lower Savannah Work Center near Aiken after
serving 15 months of a six-year prison term for aggravated assault.
   He will begin work Thursday for the Aiken-Barnwell Counties
Community Action Commission, helping the poor and counseling youths
about drug and alcohol abuse.
   Asked how he felt, Brown replied, ``I feel better.'' Then he
laughed and told reporters, ``Oh, you want me to say I feel good.
OK, I feel good,'' a reference to one of his singles, ``I Got You
(I Feel Good).''
   Brown was imprisoned in 1988 to serve a concurrent six-year
sentence in Georgia and South Carolina for failing to stop for
police, aggravated assault and weapons violations stemming from a
two-state, high-speed chase.

   Ray Combs, host of television's ``Family

nightclub owner over remarks published in the National Enquirer.
   Combs' lawsuit, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court, accuses
Charles Schneider of Cincinnati of making false statements about
the comedian.
   Combs and Schneider are already battling in Hamilton County
Common Pleas Court over ownership and operation of the CaddyCombs
Comedy Club. Schneider had Combs arrested at the comedy club on a
private criminal trespassing complaint April 6, after Combs
performed there.
   Combs' lawsuit in federal court alleges that Schneider told the
National Enquirer that Combs ``engineered his own arrest as a
publicity stunt _ and he even tipped off the TV cameras to be
there.''
   The Combs lawsuit says Schneider made the statements falsely and
with malice. The suit seeks an unspecified amount of punitive
damages.
   Schneider was out of town and his attorney, William DeCenso, was
unavailable for comment Wednesday, DeCenso's office said.

   _
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) _ Zsa Zsa Gabor has another court
date. A judge has ordered her to appear at a May 1 hearing to
decide whether she has completed community service for slapping a
police officer.
   Deputy District Attorney Elden Fox said Tuesday that the
director of a women's shelter where the actress has been working
failed to document Miss Gabor's 120 hours of community service.
   But a shelter staff member who refused to give her name told the
Los Angeles Daily News that the director mailed the documentation
to Municipal Court Judge Charles G. Rubin on Friday.
   Vera Davis, executive director of the Lower Income Elderly
United Community Assistance Program, has said Miss Gabor worked
about 50 hours at the shelter and served the rest through guest
appearances and in planning a celebrity auction at her Bel-Air
mansion with proceeds to benefit the shelter.
   The prosecutor, however, says substituting appearances and the
auction for community service was unacceptable.
   Miss Gabor has said she put in much more than the required 120
hours and plans to continue working to help the shelter. She was
convicted Sept. 29 for slapping an officer during a traffic stop
and other charges. She was sentenced to four days in jail, but that
portion of the sentence is being appealed.

<HEAD>Officials Voice Concern Over ID Card Proposal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government officials wary of creating a
national ID card voiced concern Wednesday about the idea of using
Social Security cards as the sole document for immigrants and
others to prove they're legally eligible to work.
   The General Accounting Office last month reported that the
nation's 4-year-old immigration law had resulted in hiring
discrimination by employers afraid of being punished for employing
illegal aliens.
   The agency said discrimination might be reduced by simplifying
the process for checking work eligibility, perhaps by relying on a
revised Social Security card or a driver's license with a verified
Social Security number.
   Legislation pushed by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.,
would require the government to develop plastic, counterfeit-proof
Social Security cards to replace the current paper cards.
   Moynihan said the new cards could reduce fraud, improve
confidence in Social Security and provide a more reliable means for
checking work eligibility. But the senators said he would not push
for legislative action until a government task force considers ways
to reduce hiring discrimination under the immigration law.
   Louis Enoff, deputy commissioner for programs at the Social
Security Administration, said that the agency does not need fancier
cards to do its job and that there are less expensive ways to
address employment discrimination.
   ``The administration has always had fundamental concerns about
the possibility of the Social Security card and number becoming a
universal identifier in this country,'' he told the Finance
subcommittee on Social Security and family policy.
   Andrew Strojny of the Justice Department said that requiring job
applicants to present Social Security cards could create problems
for people who lose their cards and could allow unscrupulous
employers to ``maintain a captive labor force'' by confiscating
their workers' Social Security cards.
   ``Simply because a single-card system has the virtue of
simplicity does not mean it is a simple solution,'' Strojny said.
   Gene McNary, commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, said the agency wants to avoid the creation of a national
ID card that raises the image of ``Big Brother,'' yet needs to find
a standard ``employment authorization document.'' He said the INS
was awaiting the task force's analysis.

<HEAD>Feds Faced With Regulating Bigger, Older, Less-Staffed Oil Ships</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Safety in the oil-tanker industry appears to have
taken a back seat to profits, according to a Coast Guard report on
the system used to regulate the huge ships.
   The federal agency is faced with ``formidable problems'' trying
to ensure that the ``ports are not exposed to a high degree of risk
from tank vessel operations,'' the report says.
   Problems detailed include increased vessel size, aging ships,
reduced crew sizes and limited numbers of Coast Guard inspectors to
enforce the rules.
   The document criticizes the Coast Guard for paying too much
attention to the shipowners' desire to make money and too little
attention to safety.
   ``The Coast Guard cooperates with the owners and operators by
allowing ships to be unprepared for inspections by using the old
excuse that we are facilitating commerce,'' the report says.
   The report notes that the giant tanker ships have been built the
past 20 years with 18 percent less steel than before, and
speculates that may be reason for hull cracks, especially in the
rough north Pacific.
   It says Coast Guard training programs for inspectors are
inadequate, and inspectors are overworked.
   The report was dated October 1989. It was released after The
Seattle Times filed an appeal under the Freedom of Information Act.
The newspaper had asked the Coast Guard for the document, but
reported Tuesday the Coast Guard refused the request on grounds it
was an internal working document.
   The report resulted from a study by five Coast Guard officers.
   Some of its 33 recommendations call for tougher disciplinary
action against tanker owners and crew members, and for further
studies, noting the industry hasn't been thoroughly reviewed for
more than 10 years.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Says Punchee Should Get More Money</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The victim of a fraternity party ``sucker
punch'' should get more money than a jury awarded, said an appeals
court, which also spelled out the rules to ``beer pong.''
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday that $20,000
was inadequate compensation for Daniel P. Mosser, whose left eye
socket was fractured by the 1986 punch, and sent the case back for
a new jury trial on damages alone.
   Mosser, 26, said he was ``sucker punched'' by Michael Dindak
during a spring break beer party at the Theta XI fraternity at
California University of Pennsylvania on March 23, 1986.
   Dindak, then a 20-year-old, 220-pound sophomore football player,
had disrupted a game of beer pong, gotten into a scuffle and been
ejected from the party three times, according to court records.
   Beer pong, according to a footnote in the appellate opinion, is
a drinking game in which table-tennis players aim for their
opponent's cup.
   After a fourth disturbance, Mosser, a former president of the
fraternity who graduated in 1985, was escorting Dindak out when
Dindak delivered him the surprise sock.
   Mosser, who suffers double vision, has undergone medical care _
including surgery _ costing $8,749.25. More operations are possible.
   Pennsylvania law entitles a plaintiff to compensation for all
medical expenses, plus likely future ones.
   The case was in federal court because Mosser, a Maryland
resident, was suing Dindak, a Pennsylvania resident. Dindak was
acquitted of aggravated assault in a Washington County criminal
trial.
   U.S. District Judge Robert F. Kelly wrote the opinion. Circuit
Judge Edward R. Becker concurred and Circuit Judge Walter K.
Stapleton dissented.

   Discovery's second launch attempt
with the Hubble Space Telescope was moved up one day because
preparations have gone so smoothly, NASA said Wednesday.
   ``Everyone believes we're now ready to fly, and all of us are
looking forward to the data the Hubble Space Telescope will produce
as it begins its exploration of the universe,'' said Robert
Crippen, shuttle director for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
   The launch was now set for Tuesday. Before the change, Discovery
had been scheduled to lift off April 25, 15 days after the first
attempt was scrubbed because of a faulty auxiliary power unit. The
unit was replaced last weekend and fired up early Wednesday for
about five minutes.
   After NASA verified the unit was operating properly, launch team
members and payload managers agreed to advance liftoff by a day.
   ``Safety continues to be our Number 1 priority, and that is why
the APU on Discovery was replaced,'' Crippen said in a statement.
   Each of the shuttle's three auxiliary power units must work
properly before a launch. The units pressurize the orbiter's
hydraulic system, which is used in the ship's braking and steering
systems.
   Discovery's payload bay doors will remain closed until Hubble's
batteries are placed back in the telescope late Friday or early
Saturday. The six nickel-hydrogen batteries are undergoing 130
hours of recharging at a laboratory.
   The batteries will power the $1.5 billion telescope, NASA's most
expensive and complex payload, from the time it is disconnected
from Discovery's power system until its energy-collecting solar
panels take over.
   ``The batteries are charging great,'' said Charles Pellerin Jr.,
director of astrophysics for NASA. ``We've been a long time getting
this project to this point. Everything's behaving real well for us
now.''
   Hubble's 94.5-inch mirror, the finest ever made, remains in
perfect condition despite the two-week delay, Pellerin said.
Contamination sensors removed from the payload bay last weekend
showed no evidence of additional dust or debris, he said.
   ``All the evidence is that we're just as well as if we had
gone'' on April 10, Pellerin said.
   Excess contamination would mar Hubble's ability to detect
objects 50 times fainter and with 10 times greater clarity than the
best ground-based observatory. The telescope is to orbit 380 miles
above Earth for 15 years.
   Discovery's new launch date is not expected to hamper launch
preparations for the next shuttle mission.
   Columbia originally was scheduled to lift off May 9 with a $100
million astronomical observatory known as Astro. That date has been
pushed back at least a week, however, to give NASA time to check
Discovery following its five-day mission in case something needs to
be changed on Columbia.

   A man who dashed daily across neighbors'
lawns in his souped-up Volkswagen Beetle pleaded no contest to 732
criminal charges and agreed to move away or face 275 years in jail.
   South Bay Municipal Court Judge Benjamin Aranda on Tuesday
ordered Jonathan Shane Allabaugh, 21, not to set foot in Torrance's
Hollywood Riviera neighborhood after June 1.
   ``I don't care if it's spitting on the sidewalk, smoking a
marijuana cigarette or going back into that area again,'' Aranda
said. ``If you do any of those things, I will sentence you to 275
years. ... I do not want to see this neighborhood disturbed again
in any way, shape or form.''
   Allabaugh pleaded no contest to one count each of disturbing the
peace and driving with a suspended license for every day of the
year that ended Aug. 31.
   He also pleaded no contest to brandishing a firearm and assault
with a deadly weapon, for steering his baby-blue Beetle at a
pedestrian.
   And he agreed to move out of the house he shares with his
grandmother and great-grandmother.
   Neighbors complained that Allabaugh drove across their lawns,
aimed his car at pedestrians and made obscene gestures at anyone
who told him to slow down.
   Torrance prosecutor J.D. Lord said Allabaugh was convicted in
1987 of disturbing the peace but resumed speeding up and down his
street soon after his one-year probation ended.
   Torrance is about 20 miles south of downtown Los Angeles.

   President Bush today challenged critics who
deride him for emphasizing additional research over immediate steps
against global warming, stating that ``we have never considered
research a substitute for action.''
   Speaking at the close of an international conference on climate
change, Bush acknowledged criticism of his research-oriented
approach and his emphasis on the need to assess economic factors.
   ``To those who suggest we're only trying to balance economic
growth and environmental protection, I say they miss the point,''
Bush told delegates, many of whom have criticized his go-slow
approach.
   ``We are calling for an entirely new way of thinking, to achieve
both while compromising neither, by applying the power of the
marketplace in the service of the environment,'' he said.
   ``Above all,'' Bush told the government representatives, ``the
climate change debate is not about `research versus action' for we
have never considered research a substitute for action.''
   Bush said the United States has offered four proposals: a
charter for cooperation in science and economics research on global
change, possible creation of an International Institutes for
Research on the Science and Economics of Global Change, an
international system for exchanging data, and a ``statement of
principles'' for international cooperation in scientific and
economics research on global change.
   ``I call on you to support these suggestions,'' Bush told the
foreign delegates gathered for the conference.
   
   The two-day White House conference, attended by senior
government officials from 19 countries, has been marked by discord
over whether specific commitments should be made to reduce
so-called greenhouse pollutants, especially carbon dioxide.
   Despite the disagreements, however, senior administration
officials and many of the delegates suggested the conference likely
would go along with a U.S. call for broader research into global
warming and its economic impact.
   The conference concludes later today.
   President Bush told the conference Tuesday that more research is
needed ``to sort out the science'' of the greenhouse effect. He
rejected suggestions that specific response strategies be developed
immediately.
   That brought prompt criticism from some of the European
delegations.
   ``Gaps in knowledge must not be used as an excuse for worldwide
inaction,'' declared Klaus Topfer, the West German environmental
minister. Later he tempered his criticism of the U.S. position,
saying the call for additional research is not altogether bad.
   The West Germans today were to outline details of their proposed
25 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions.
   The United States has argued it is too early to make a
commitment on specific pollution reductions. Instead, it has sought
to focus the conference on gaining international support for more
research on the scientific questions on global warming and the
economic costs.
   Attending the conference were senior environmental ministers
from the 19 countries as well as Cabinet-level officials on
economics, scientific and energy issues.
   Allan Bromley, Bush's science adviser and a conference
co-chairman, told reporters he hoped the delegates would commit to
a broadened international research effort and begin to routinely
consider economic issues in the global warming debate.
   ``President Bush does not feel in any sense the research should
be a substitute for action,'' Bromley said.
   Some European countries have advocated for months that
industrial nations commit themselves to stabilizing carbon dioxide
emissions by the year 2000. Many environmentalists say emissions
should be cut by 20 percent.
   Such pollution cuts would require increased energy conservation,
development of more fuel-efficient automobiles and more energy
efficiency in homes and businesses.
   Talk about further research and economic considerations should
``not distract us from taking action on carbon dioxide
stabilization now,'' Hans Alders, the Dutch environmental minister,
told the conference during a closed working session Tuesday.
   ``We needed Love Canal before hazardous waste was tackled. We
needed a dying River Rhine before waste water was treated. ... My
country has decided to learn the lessons from the past and act on
global warming now,'' Alders told the delegates, according to a
transcript provided by the Dutch delegation.
   Delegates from France, Italy and environmental officials from
the European Community also warned against substituting research
for action.
   ``We didn't come here to argue with the United States or anybody
else,'' said Padraig Flynn, the Irish environmental minister and a
member of the delegation from the European Community.
   But while supporting the call for more research, Flynn added,
``Research must not be used to put off the problems that must be
addressed today.''
   In welcoming the delegates Tuesday, Bush acknowledged the
disagreements, saying, ``I know there's a debate raging out there.''
   Scientists agree that man-made pollution, especially the release
of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels, is causing heat to be
trapped and will result in a warming of the globe. But the severity
of the warming and how specific regions of the Earth will be
affected is not as clear.
   Some computer models have suggested the global temperatures
could increase by as much as four to nine degrees Fahrenheit by the
middle of the next century, causing coastal flooding and a shift of
weather and agriculture patterns. Other scientists say the impact
is uncertain because of a variety of factors, such as the uncertain
effect of clouds.

<HEAD>Soviet Union Says it Opposes East German Unification Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK FRITZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has told East German Prime
Minister Lothar de Maiziere that it opposes his plan for quick
unification with West Germany, German media said Wednesday.
   De Maiziere received a letter Wednesday outlining the Soviet
Union's informal positions on unification, the West German ZDF
television network said.
   The letter said the Soviet Union opposes quick unification
because it would allow East Germany to be quickly integrated into
the NATO military alliance, ZDF said.
   The Soviet Union opposes NATO membership for a reunified
Germany. East Germany is now a part of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact
and West Germany is a member of the Western alliance.
   De Maiziere's new government, chosen by the country's first
freely elected Parliament last week, supports a form of unification
that would allow East Germany to merge with its Western neighbor,
accepting the West German constitution as it is.
   Another form of unification would require dissolution of the
basic laws of both Germanys and drafting of a new constitution.
That would take considerably longer.
   The strategic future of a unified Germany will be the main
negotiating point when the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain
and France take part in unification talks, expected in the coming
weeks.
   The two Germanys are to negotiate separately on the domestic
aspects of unification and the logistics of merging a decaying
economy with wealthy West Germany.
   The East German government Wednesday released its first detailed
economic figures. They described a grim economic landscape of
declining production.
   Industrial output fell by 5 percent during the first quarter of
this year compared to the same period in 1989, said the
government's chief statistician, Arno Donda.
   Donda said supply bottlenecks and production cuts aimed at
curbing pollution were partly to blame.
   But he said the main reason was the drop in manpower. The number
of people employed in industry was down 124,000 from a year ago,
while there were 33,000 fewer workers in construction, Donda said.
   More than 500,000 East Germans, many of them skilled workers,
have migrated to West Germany since January 1989.
   As of the end of March, more than 38,000 workers had registered
for unemployment, he said. There were nearly 106,000 job vacancies,
35,000 fewer than in February.
   The figure is the first specific jobless statistic released by
the government. Unemployment was not acknowledged under the ousted
Communist regime.
   Experts predict that reunification will trigger widespread
unemployment as the former Communist country's outmoded factories
are closed and its inefficient enterprises are forced to compete in
a free market.
   With the opening of the East German borders in November, many
East Germans have begun buying West German products.
   East Germany's new government has proposed that some of the
country's vast social service network be kept intact to ease the
economic blow.
   Regine Hildebrandt, the labor and social affairs minister in de
Maiziere's government, called Wednesday for job guarantees and a
program to retrain workers so they can have more marketable skills
in a unified Germany.
   Last week, the East Berlin-based Institute for International
Politics and Economics predicted that even with a 5 percent annual
growth rate, 1.5 million East German workers could be jobless by
1995.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Says States May Ban Child Pornography in Homes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   States may make it a crime to possess or look
at child pornography, even in one's home, the Supreme Court said
Wednesday as it imposed new limits on freedom of expression and
privacy.
   Voting 6-3, the justices upheld an Ohio law aimed at stamping
out such material by punishing those who buy it, not only those who
sell it.
   Conservatives cheered the decision, saying it gives states a
blueprint for tough legislation.
   Beverly LaHaye of Concerned Women for America said every state
should ``take advantage of this decision and immediately begin to
crack down on this depraved and contemptible exploitation of
children.''
   But Justice William J. Brennan, in an opinion dissenting from
the court ruling, said the law is so vague and so sweeping that it
might ban the engravings of nude children ``that adorn our
courtroom.''
   In a separate issue involving children, several justices voiced
concern Wednesday that society's desire to protect children could
deny fair trials to people charged with child abuse.
   Justice Antonin Scalia led the questioning as the court heard
arguments in cases from Maryland and Idaho on whether defendants in
child-abuse cases are entitled to at least one face-to-face
confrontation with their young accusers.
   The Maryland case involved accusations against a female day care
center owner by a 7-year-old.
   State Attorney General J. Joseph Curran Jr. said the child was
allowed to testify over closed-circuit television because a social
worker had said she would be too upset to testify in court.
   Scalia said a court appearance might well be ``something of an
emotional trauma, but this woman is going to jail for 15 years.''
   As for child pornography, 18 states besides Ohio already have
laws against possessing such material. Ohio's law has been
described as the nation's toughest.
   A more liberal high court invoked free-speech and privacy rights
in 1969 when it barred states from outlawing at-home possession of
obscene materials.
   But the court said Wednesday such protection applies only to
obscenity depicting adults. At-home possession of sexually explicit
material depicting children is not protected, even if the material
is not obscene, the court said.
   The justices in 1982 carved out a major exception to free-speech
rights when they let states outlaw the sale and distribution of
material depicting children in sexual performances or poses _ even
if not obscene.
   The court for over 30 years has allowed states to outlaw the
sale and distribution of obscene material, ruling in a series of
cases that such material is not constitutionally protected.
   Justice Byron R. White, writing for the court Wednesday, said
Ohio legitimately seeks to ``destroy a market for the exploitative
use of children'' by making possession of child pornography a crime.
   ``Given the importance of the state's interest in protecting the
victims of child pornography, we cannot fault Ohio for attempting
to stamp out this vice at all levels in the distribution chain,''
he said.
   White agreed with prosecutors that the child-pornography
industry has gone underground and the best way to attack it is by
drying up the market of potential buyers.
   He also said Ohio's law is not too broad because, in effect, the
Ohio Supreme Court rewrote it to forbid only ``lewd'' depictions of
children with a ``graphic focus'' on the genitals.
   Having innocuous photos of one's children wearing no clothes is
not a crime, White said.
   In the case in question, the court on narrow grounds struck down
the conviction of Clyde Osborne of Columbus who challenged the Ohio
law.
   The justices said the jury was not instructed properly. They
ordered a new trial for Osborne, who had been sentenced to six
months in prison and fined $100 for possessing nude photos of a boy
believed to be 13 or 14.
   But Brennan said the court, by upholding the Ohio law, is
sacrificing individual rights in its zeal to crack down on child
pornography.
   ``At bottom, the court today is so disquieted by the possible
exploitation of children in the production of the pornography that
it is willing to tolerate the imposition of criminal penalties for
simple possession,'' he said.
   ``Mr. Osborne's pictures may be distasteful, but the
Constitution guarantees both his right to possess them privately
and his right to avoid punishment under an overbroad law.''
   Joining Brennan's opinion were Justices Thurgood Marshall and
John Paul Stevens.
   White was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Harry A. Blackmun, Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and
Anthony M. Kennedy.
   Osborne was 61 when he was prosecuted in 1985. Prosecutors said
he got the pictures from a Florida mail-order business, and had
placed them in a photo album in his home.
   The photos were discovered after police searched Osborne's home
on a tip that he had bought the material.
   Ohio's law bans possession or viewing of ``any material or
performance that shows a minor ... in a state of nudity.''
Exemptions were included for parents and, among other things, for
photos with an artistic, medical or scientific purpose.

<HEAD>Bentsen Seeks Health-Care Coverage For All Poor Children</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation to expand health-care coverage to
all children and teen-agers living in poverty was announced
Wednesday by Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee.
   Bentsen, D-Texas, is proposing to gradually expand Medicaid
health insurance coverage to an additional 2.5 million children and
teens at a cost of $1.6 billion over the first five years,
beginning in 1991.
   Under his plan, which will be considered by the Senate Finance
Committee after its introduction Thursday, children under age 19
would be guaranteed Medicaid coverage if their family's income is
below the federal poverty line, now $12,675 for a family of four.
   Bentsen said his bill, the Medicaid Child Health Act of 1990,
would give more children access to preventive care and other health
care services.
   ``We're seeing an alarming increase in the incidence of
childhood diseases that could have been prevented with such routine
treatment as a timely, basic set of immunizations,'' Bentsen said.
   In 1983, fewer than 1,600 cases of measles were reported. But by
1989, there were more than 17,000 cases. Early indications for 1990
are that the number continues to grow, Bentsen said.
   Bentsen said every $1 spent on immunizations saves $10 in health
care costs later on, while every $1 spent on prenatal care saves
more than $3 in the first year of a child's life.
   According to the Department of Health and Human Services, the
United States ranks 22nd in the world in infant mortality.

<HEAD>Court Says Judges May Order Tax Hikes to Pay for Desegregation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal judges may order local officials to
raise property taxes to pay for the racial desegregation of public
schools, the Supreme Court said Wednesday.
   Although ruling unanimously in a Kansas City, Mo., case that
judges themselves generally may not impose such tax increases, the
court voted 5-4 in empowering judges to tell school officials to do
so.
   The justices said such orders even take precedence over state
laws imposing limits on school property taxes.
   Civil rights forces praised the decision. ``It's a powerful
reaffirmation that state laws may not impede the vindication of
constitutional rights, the rights of schoolchildren,'' said Paul
Holtzman of the Washington-based Lawyers' Committee for Civil
Rights Under Law.
   Through the last three decades, the court has given federal
judges sweeping power to take whatever steps necessary to end
public school segregation _ including forced busing of students,
teacher reassignments, and even the partial merger of separate
school districts.
   But never had the court authorized judges to bring about higher
taxes to pay for various desegregation plans.
   ``I can't pretend we got the better of it,'' said Benna Ruth
Solomon, a lawyer for the National Governors' Association, the
National League of Cities and the National Conference of State
Legislatures.
   Missouri Attorney General William Webster said the ruling
``poses new questions that now must be addressed,'' but added, ``We
find encouragement in the fact that four justices joined in the
opinion that the remedy imposed by the district court was
excessive.''
   In other matters, the court:
   _Ruled by a 6-3 vote that states may outlaw possessing or
looking at child pornography _ even in one's own home.
   The justices upheld an Ohio law, said to be the nation's most
stringent, aimed at stamping out so-called kiddie porn by punishing
those who buy the material, not only those who sell it.
   _Ruled, 7-2, that an overnight guest in a private home enjoys
the same privacy protection as the homeowner against unreasonable
police arrests and searches.
   The decision struck down the murder conviction of a Minnesota
man because he was arrested in a home where he was staying by
police who did not first obtain a court warrant.
   _Heard arguments in cases from Maryland and Idaho over the right
of people charged with child abuse to at least one face-to-face
confrontation with their young accusers. Decisions are expected by
July.
   In the school desegregation case, the court said U.S. District
Judge Russell G. Clark abused his discretion when he imposed a tax
hike for the Kansas City school district.
   ``Local officials should at least have the opportunity to devise
their own solutions to these problems,'' Justice Byron R. White
wrote for the court.
   But White said Clark could have forced officials to raise taxes
to pay for the desegregation plan _ ``magnet schools'' and $260
million worth of renovations _ he ordered.
   Missouri law limits property taxes, but White said Clark could
order Kansas City school officials to ignore that law.
   ``A local government with taxing authority may be ordered to
levy taxes in excess of the limit set by state statute where there
is reason based in the Constitution for not observing the statutory
limitation,'' White said.
   He was joined by Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall,
Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Anthony M.
Kennedy, Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia dissented.
   Writing for the four, Kennedy said, ``Today's casual embrace of
taxation imposed by the unelected, life-tenured federal judiciary
disregards fundamental precepts for the democratic control of
public institutions.''
   Saying there is no real distinction between a judge directly
imposing a tax and ``commanding the school district to impose'' it,
Kennedy said the ruling might be used to justify ordering higher
taxes to pay for prisons, hospitals or a civil rights lawsuit award
against a city government.
   Before 1954, Missouri law required schools to be racially
segregated. In the following 35 years, the percentage of black
students in Kansas City's school district rose from 22.5 to about
75 percent.
   Black parents sued in 1977 over the decline of what had become
predominantly black schools, alleging black students were being
denied equal educational opportunities.
   Clark ruled in 1987 that the school district's ``physical
facilities have literally rotted,'' and ordered state and district
officials to upgrade them.
   The state was ordered to pay three-fourths of the remedial
costs; the school district one-fourth.
   School district voters had rejected six proposals since 1970 to
increase taxes for education. Clark nearly doubled the local
property tax _ ordering the school district to raise the tax from
$2.05 to $4 per $100 of assessed valuation to help finance the
improvements.

<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zimbabwe celebrated a decade of
independence Wednesday with military marches and tribal dancing,
while President Robert Mugabe said he welcomed an end to the
British-brokered constitution.
   A near-capacity crowd joined Mugabe, seven other African
presidents and scores of foreign dignitaries at a 60,000-seat
stadium outside Harare for festivities. Processions and rallies
were organized countrywide.
   ``We are here to share our jubilation on this historic and
momentous occasion,'' said Mugabe, a former schoolteacher who led
his country to indepedendence from British colonial rule April 18,
1980. The former white-ruled colony of Rhodesia was mired in a
guerrilla war for seven years before independence.
   Mugabe said the second decade of independence would witness even
greater moves toward unity, peace and progress.
   ``We can do it. Yes, we can do it together as one united people,
one nation,'' he said.
   Mugabe carefully avoided referring to controversial issues such
as his avowed aim to turn one of Africa's few Western-style
democracies into a Marxist one-party state.
   Mugabe said he welcomed Wednesday's expiration of the 10-year
constitution brokered by the British that contained ``entrenched
racial provisions'' protecting the interests of the 90,000-strong
white community.
   ``We shall proceed, in the name of justice, equity and fairness,
to amend these provisions so as to make more land available to the
peasant population,'' he said.
   Under the so-called Lancaster House constitution, 20 seats in
the 100-member Parliament were reserved for whites for the first
seven years of independence. Legal clauses blocked the seizure of
white-owned property.
   The formula was intended to stop a mass exodus of skilled whites.
   The government says 4,000 mostly white commercial farmers still
own more than one-fourth of all land, while some 8 million peasants
occupy about one-third of property. The rest is state property and
wilderness preserves.
   But state officials have said that after April 18, they will
move to buy little-used farmland. Widescale seizures of farms are
not expected.
   During his anniversary address, Mugabe acknowledged the role of
large commercial farms in the economy. He said that apart from
wheat imports, this Southern African nation of 9.2 million people
is self-sufficient in food.
   He also praised local industries, mainly in the hands of white
entrepreneurs. Manufacturers generate nearly 30 percent of the
gross domestic product of about $4 billion, Mugabe said.
   He said more local and foreign investment in production was
needed to combat rising uemployment and shortages of essential
commodities.
   Flanked by President Danial arap Moi of Kenya and President
Hastings Kamuzu Banda of Malawi, Mugabe said his people were eager
for regional peace and an end to South Africa's system of racial
separation.
   Mugabe and Moi are mediating efforts to end the 12-year-old
civil war in neighboring Mozambique.
   Hundreds of Zimbabweans have died in cross-border raids by
rebels from Mozambique scavenging food and supplies. More than
12,000 Zimbabwean troops are fighting alongside government forces
there.
   Other African presidents at the celebrations were Quett Masire
of Botswana, Mengistu Haile Mariam of Ethiopia, Sam Nujoma of
Namibia and Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia.
   Foreign dignitaries representing 30 countries included South
African black nationalist leader Nelson Mandela, South African
church leader Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Coretta Scott King, widow
of slain U.S. civil rights leader Martin Luther King.

<HEAD>Democrats Unveil Alternative to Bush 1991 Budget</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Democratic leaders announced today a
fiscal 1991 budget which would cut defense spending to pay for new
domestic programs and reducing the deficit.
   ``The world is changed greatly,'' said Speaker Thomas S. Foley,
D-Wash. ``The tasks this country has borne for the last 40 years
... have been crowned with great success'' and it was now time to
address domestic priorities, he said.
   In the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, the Democrats propose
$295 billion in military spending, compared to $303.3 billion
proposed by Bush. The cuts would escalate sharply over five years
for a total cut of $251 billion, compared to what it would be if
the military budget kept pace with inflation.
   Of that total, $145 billion would go toward reducing the federal
deficits and $106 billion would go to domestic programs.
   Other deficit reduction in the plan was unclear Wednesday, as
Democratic leaders declined to provide details. The budget would
call for $13.9 billion in tax increases, the same total proposed by
President Bush.
   House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., said he
was proposing no domestic spending cuts deeper than those proposed
by President Bush, and in many cases reductions he was proposing
were rejected.
   Panetta said the budget recognized the shift the United States
must make ``from military confrontation to economic leadership ...
from a Cold War economy to a peacetime economy.''
   Panetta's plan will be presented Thursday to the Budget
Committee.

<TEXT>
   Fires, bombings and poisonings have
killed more than 280 people in recent days, the result of lax
safety regulations, ethnic violence and an overcrowded
transportation system.
   During fire safety week this week, a train explosion burned 100
passengers to death in the east. Blazes in the capital destroyed
600 shops, 1,300 shacks and the capital's only convention center.
   In faraway Assam state, a wildfire ripped through 1,000 houses
and three saw mills.
   A food poisoning outbreak during a marriage engagement party
killed 150 people near Lucknow, in the north. Another outbreak near
Rajkot, in the west, hospitalized 400.
   The connection between them all, said the respected Indian
Express newspaper in an editorial Wednesday: ``They were eminently
avoidable.''
   ``These events reflect a general attitude,'' the Express said.
``We heed no law, we abide by no norm.''
   The paper added another item to the list, a recently banned
carcinogenic chemical that it says is still being used to
manufacture soft drinks.
   The string of disasters has set India wondering. Asked one
leading social scientist, Bhabani Sen Gupta: ``What is going on?''
   With 880 million people on a land mass about one-third the size
of the United States, India is prone to major disasters. Population
density reaches more than 1,600 per square mile in New Delhi and
five times that in the slums of Bombay and Calcutta.
   More than 10 million people ride trains every day and passenger
cars are jammed, with people often perching on the roofs. Colorful
buses, their cabins dedicated to any one of a pantheon of Hindu
gods, also move millions a day.
   The weight this number of people places on India's railway and
road network is a recipe for trouble. The two national wire
services, Press Trust of India and United News of India, routinely
move stories of buses careening down ravines, killing scores.
   Add ethnic violence to this overtaxed infrastructure and the
formula can become explosive.
   In the far northeastern state of Assam last Thursday, extremists
from the Bodo tribe bombed railway lines, a road and a major
bridge, killing 25 people and cutting the already isolated state
off the Indian heartland. The Bodo tribe, which worships spirits
believed to inhabit rocks and trees, wants a separate homeland.
   A day earlier, a bomb exploded on a crowded commuter train in
the bustling western metropolis of Bombay and injured 31. A
militant Moslem group, Mujahedeen Kashmir, fighting for the
secession of Kashmir from India, claimed responsibility. More than
250 people have been killed in that fight since the government
launched a crackdown in January.
   On Friday, a bomb blew up a crowded bus in New Delhi, killing
six people and wounding dozens more. A bomb blast killed a woman in
a village 70 miles north of Bombay on Tuesday. There were no claims
of responsibility in either incident. Eight bombs were found
planted on a northern railroad track Tuesday.
   ``I think the educated Indian has to ask himself whether we're
not going mad,'' said Sen Gupta in an interview.
   Most of this week's disasters appear unrelated to terrorism, but
that, he said, could give even more cause to worry.
   ``We have only ourselves to blame then,'' he said. ``Life has
become cheap in India.''
   The train disaster in Patna that left 100 dead was apparently
triggered by a leaking gas cylinder. But after the fire started,
none of the passengers could stop the train because the alarm chain
had been removed, media reports said.
   In India, transporting explosive substances on passenger trains
is against the law. But, as the National Herald newspaper observed,
``If the passengers are able to violate the laws with impunity, it
is because of the indifference of the railway authorities.''
   The Times of India blamed pesticides in the food for the food
poisoning deaths near Lucknow. It said stringent regulations
controlling the use of the deadly substances were routinely
ignored. Problems were compounded by a physicians' strike in the
area.
   In New Delhi, the fire in the government's main convention
center, which broke out during a conference of police chiefs, came
two years after the fire department declared the building unsafe.
Nothing had been done to repair it.
   Firetrucks rushed to the scene still draped in bunting that
read, ``Fire Services Week April 15-21,'' a week dedicated to fire
safety nationwide.
   The blaze in the Sardar Bazaar, which gutted 600 shops, occurred
in a crowded area, whose residents and merchants had long demanded
better water pressure. So had the inhabitants of the shantytown in
Badola village, just outside New Delhi.
   On Wednesday, all major newspapers called for reforms. But one
chief editor reported that none of his colleagues were really
optimistic much could be done.
   Said the Express: ``No disaster, however terrible, seems to make
a difference.''

   Here's a look at what is at stake economically for
Lithuania and the Soviet Union if the Baltic republic is isolated:
   
   IN THE SOVIET ECONOMIC ARSENAL
   _ Lithuania receives all of its oil, gas and diesel fuel from
the Soviet Union, paying subsidized prices. At world market prices,
Lithuania would run a deficit of $700 million for oil alone.
   _ It also receives all of its metals, cotton, tractors and
automobiles from the Soviet Union.
   _ It receives 58 percent of its sugar from Cuba, via the Soviet
Union.
   _ It receives 37 percent of its concentrated fertilizer from the
Soviet Union. Cotton, 100 percent.
   _ It received 400,000 tons of grain from the Soviets in 1989.
   _ It has only four to five days' supply of newsprint, and the
Soviets could cut off the supply, thus shutting down its newspapers.
   
   IN LITHUANIA'S ECONOMIC ARSENAL
   _ The republic sends to the Soviet Union 1.5 percent of the
nation's total production, including household electrical meters
(100 percent); television set components (70 percent); and tractor
components (30 percent).
   _ It produces much more meat (530,000 metric tons in 1987), eggs
(1.2 million metric tons in 1987), milk (3.1 million metric tons in
1987) and other dairy products than it consumes, so it could cut
off the rest of the Soviet Union from its surplus.
   _ Textile products are shipped to factories in the Soviet Union,
including one plant in Leningrad that employs 18,000 workers.
   _ If the Soviets shut down an oil pipeline to a major refinery
in the town of Mazeikiai, that would also mean the republics of
Estonia, Latvia and Byelorussia would be cut off. A shutdown of a
natural gas pipeline also would interrupt the flow to Kaliningrad,
part of the Russian republic west of Lithuania.
   _ Lithuania might demand world prices for exporting oil, gas and
other products through its Baltic ports, including Klaipeda.

   Officials angered by another NATO air
collision over a West German city called Wednesday for cuts in
training flights that continue despite relaxed East-West relations.
   Canada suspended all interceptor training flights of its F-18
jets pending an investigation into the Tuesday collision, which
killed one pilot and showered parts of the city of Karlsruhe with
flaming debris.
   ``In times of East-West detente, our people can no longer be
told that military air maneuvers must continue at their present
extent for the sake of defense preparedness,'' said Lothar Spaeth,
the Christian Democratic governor of Baden-Wuerttemberg state,
which includes Karlsruhe.
   The government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who heads the
Christian Democrats, has given its full support to NATO and the
alliance's stated need for continued air maneuvers.
   But the Defense Ministry in Bonn said it had ``urgently asked
the Canadian air force to quickly and comprehensively clear up the
causes of the accident.''
   The ministry, in a statement to the news media, said it asked
the Canadians to examine whether ``interceptor training with
F-18s'' should be stopped until the reasons for the accident are
known.
   The Canadian Forces said it was complying with the Defense
Ministry's request. In interceptor flights, two jets simulate a
chase.
   The Canadians said air-to-ground training of the F-18s, in which
the aircraft simulate support for ground forces, will continue.
   A spokeswoman for the Canadian Forces in Lahr said the flight
recorders from both planes in Tuesday's collision had been found
but the cause of the crash was not known.
   One Canadian pilot was killed and another broke both heels after
ejecting safely and landing on a highway after the accident
Tuesday. He was listed in good condition in a hospital.
   Two West Germans were slightly injured by debris. West German
news media said it was a miracle no civilians were killed in
Karlsruhe, a southwestern city of 285,000 people. Burning debris
crushed a number of cars and damaged buildings.
   In 1988, military jet crashes at the Ramstein U.S. air base and
in the city of Remscheid killed German civilians as well as NATO
pilots.
   Hans-Jochen Vogel, head of the opposition Social Democrats,
demanded an immediate stop to NATO practice flights over densely
settled West German areas.
   Friedel Laepple, interior minister for Saarland state who is
also a Social Democrat, demanded a general halt to all military
training flights over West Germany.
   Each NATO country has responsibility for training its own pilots
in West Germany, where more NATO forces are based than in any other
country.
   Tuesday's crash was NATO's first major air accident since the
hard-line Communist government in East Germany fell in October. The
new government will negotiate a merger with West Germany, which
would eliminate one of the most heavily guarded borders in the
world.
   Soviet troops have begun pulling out of Eastern European nations
since a wave of democratic reform swept across the region last
year, and superpower arms reduction talks have accelerated.

   On the 84th anniversary of the Great Quake,
folks who live in the earth-churning San Francisco region had
plenty reason to pay close attention to the pulse of the San
Andreas Fault.
   They got a chilling reminder when a series of earthquakes
rumbled through Northern California on Wednesday, shattering nerves
but little else.
   The tremors along the San Andreas hit about 90 minutes after 150
survivors of the 1906 quake and subsequent inferno gathered in the
predawn darkness to talk about the time the earth shook and the sky
glowed.
   The group has held a reunion every year since 1924 at Lotta's
Fountain on Market Street, where they observe a moment of silence
at 5:13 a.m., when the estimated 8.3-magnitude quake struck on
April 18, 1906.
   Some survivors were just a few days old 84 years ago, others
were old enough to remember camping in city parks while fires raged
throughout the city.
   One man recalled how he was tossed from the first floor window
of the orphanage he lived in as the children were evacuated.
   The reunion organizer, Taren Sapienza, said some survivors
weren't bothered by Wednesday's earthquakes. They were en route to
paint gold a fire hydrant that continued to work after the 1906
quake and helped save a neighborhood.
   ``One or two of the survivors commented that it didn't faze them
at all as they had experienced THE big one,'' said Sapienza.
   The Great Quake killed hundreds, perhaps thousands, destroyed
about 30,000 buildings and left 225,000 homeless.
   About 400,000 square miles were believed rattled when a 270-mile
zone of the 650-mile fault slipped. In a titanic shrug of the
plates that separate the North American continent from the Pacific
Basin, the western side of the rupture moved north, while the
eastern side moved south.
   One geologist said it was as though ``San Francisco and Los
Angeles were being drawn closer together.''
   For decades it was believed that about 700 people died in the
quake. But in recent years, research by San Francisco City
Archivist Gladys Hansen documented at least 2,500 deaths, and she
indicated the real toll may be much higher.
   Mrs. Hansen reached her conclusions by examining public records,
obituaries and clippings from old newspapers and letters from
people telling her of relatives who died. She found many quake
victims died in other cities after an estimated 250,000 people
evacuated San Francisco on boats and trains within three days of
the catastrophe.
   Nearly every city from Eureka near the Oregon line south to
Salinas near Monterey sustained damage.
   All over the city, refugees fled with what belongings they could
gather. Whole families harnessed themselves to wagons to haul their
household treasures to safe areas. Soup kitchens fed the homeless
in Union Square.
   In a New York City newspaper, a reporter wrote that ``the
gayest, lightest-hearted city of this continent is no more...''
   Opera singer Enrico Caruso was in San Francisco at the time,
booked at the Grand Opera House in the role of Don Jose in
``Carmen.'' He was asleep at the Palace Hotel when the quake hit.
He got to the street in his night clothes.
   ``... I run into the street,'' he said later. ``I see buildings
shaking. That night I sleep on hard ground.''
   Caruso fled the city, vowing never to return.

   The Sixth Amendment to the Constitution
guarantees that a person accused of a crime may see his accuser
face-to-face. Now, the Supreme Court is debating whether that
applies when the accuser is a sexually abused child.
   In two cases argued before the court Wednesday, the justices
focused on the rights of the defendents more than on the rights and
possible traumatization of children.
   In a 1986 case in which a Maryland day-care center operator,
Sandra Ann Craig, was convicted of abusing a 6-year-old girl, the
child testified by closed-circuit television. That is the practice
in many states.
   The conviction and 10-year sentence were overturned by a higher
state court on grounds that the judge should have questioned the
girl and other children in Mrs. Craig's presence, however briefly.
   The state court stopped short of invalidating the Maryland law
that allows young children to testify by closed-circuit TV, outside
the presence of the defendant.
   ``This woman could be sentenced to 15 years on the basis of the
testimony of a child she wasn't even in the room with,'' Justice
Antonin Scalia said about Mrs. Craig.
   Scalia noted that the judge permitted the televised appearance
on the basis of testimony of a social worker that the child would
be upset.
   Maryland Attorney General J. Joseph Curran Jr. argued that a
social worker had told the trial judge that if the child were
forced to testify in front of Mrs. Craig, she ``would probably stop
talking, withdraw, and curl up in a ball.''
   ``That's something of an emotional trauma, but this women is
going to jail for 15 years,'' Scalia said.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said: ``I suppose it's possible a
rape victim or a victim of a Mafia-type crime would be so
terrified, the same argument could be made.''
   But William H. Murphy, representing Mrs. Craig, suggested that
substituting a television appearance for live testimony was an
experiment at the expense of his client.
   ``This is a bad experiment,'' he said. ``The truth-seeking
function is not served.
   ``We take the position there is much more to the right to
confrontation than was permitted in this case,'' Murphy said,
adding that televised testimony acts ``to deprive a defendant of
one of the tools'' of his defense.
   In the second case, the issue was whether the right of Laura Lee
Wright of Boise, Idaho, to confront her accuser was violated by the
testimony of a pediatrician who had examined a 2-year-old girl
allegedly abused by the girl's father, Robert Giles.
   Mrs. Wright and Giles were convicted of sexually abusing Mrs.
Wright's two daughters. The 5-year-old child was not Giles'.
   Mrs. Wright was sentenced to 20 years in prison, but the Idaho
Supreme Court threw out her conviction in June and ordered a new
trial. The state court ruled that the trial judge wrongly allowed a
doctor who examined the 2-year-old to testify about what she told
him. Giles' case was not addressed by the Supreme Court.
   Idaho Attorney General Jim Jones told the high court that the
girl's older sister testified about sexual activities and that her
statements were corroborated by the doctor's testimony.
   The 2-year-old told the doctor: ``Daddy does do this with me,
but a little more with my sister than with me.'' The girl was
referring to Giles, according to court documents.
   During that argument, Scalia interjected: ``I wouldn't want to
be a defendant in such circumstances. I get no shot at the child.''
   Decisions are expected by July.

   A coroner admitted Wednesday he
mistakenly identified the remains of a pet rabbit as a year-old boy
killed with his mother in a fire.
   ``It was the body of something,'' said Dr. C. Dupha Reeves,
Wayne County coroner. ``Because I was told a mother and child died
in the fire, I assumed it was the body of the child. I
misidentified it.''
   Gary Rotondo discovered his son's body last week when he
returned to his mobile home after the Feb. 28 fire. He had thought
the remains of his live-in girlfriend, Vickie Lee Evans, 18, and
their son, John, had been cremated.
   Police have reopened their investigation into the deaths.
   Reeves, who is 80 and was first elected coroner 26 years ago,
said he did not go to the fire scene on the day of the blaze.
   He saw the bodies later at the Newark-Wayne Community Hospital,
but did not do an autopsy or try to identify the remains through
records or fingerprints.
   He said it would have been impossible to make an accurate
identification because, ``There was nothing left of them.''
   Rotondo's father, Paul, said police told him an autopsy would
now be performed on the remains even though only a badly burned
torso was found.
   He said the boy's X-rays and records were on file at the
hospital.
   Autopsies are not required by New York state law, but several
pathologists say they should be performed in fire cases.
   ``Once you have burned, charred remains, distinguishing between
animals and humans, superficially, externally, can be difficult,''
said Dr. Michael Baden, co-director of the state police forensics
unit.
   Wayne County is about 15 miles east of Rochester.

   A human rights group said Wednesday that U.S.
Border Patrol agents have mistreated and even killed Mexicans
trying to illegally enter the United States.
   But Border Patrol representatives said the agents are defending
themselves along an increasingly violent U.S.-Mexican border, where
they facndits and aliens who try to force their way
into the United States.
   Violence along the border was the subject of a hearing sponsored
by the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on human rights and
international organizations. ``It is clear that somete attack from bahing
is wrong
on our borders,'' said Rep. Gus Yatron, D-Pa., the subcommittee
chairman.
   ``I wish I could say that violent confrontations between
Americans and undocumented immigrants are isolated, but,
unfortunately, they are not,'' Rep. Jim Bates, D-Calif., said.
   He said the American Friends Service Committee, a Quaker
humanitarian organization, has documented 20 people in the last
four years who were shot and killed near San Diego by the border
patrol, an arm of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   The committee also released a report on 380 cases of alleged
human rights violations between May 1988 and May 1989. They
occurred near San Diego; Rio Grande, Texas; Tuscon, Ariz.; El Paso,
TexasP) _ A children's advocacy group said Wednesday it
wants the government to investigate whether a long-range microphone
marketed in a line of high-tech toys is an illegal eavesdropping
device.
   ``Part of it is just a pretend spy kit,'' said Peggy Charren,
president of Action for Children's Television. ``The problem is
that the listening device works. It is not then a toy; it is an
eavesdropping device.''
   Tyco Industries Inc. manufactures the ``Spy-Tech'' toy line,
which includes the microphone, an undercover vest, binoculars, an
intruder alert, periscope, fingerprint kit, walkie talkies and a
hidden camera. The toys, each sold separately, are designed for
children 8 years and older.
   Charren said ACT this week would ask the Federal Communications
Commission and the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the
microphone, which picks up sound up to 100 feet away. That group
wants the FTC to investigate Tyco's print and broadcast
advertisements for the product.
   ``We find this criticism so amazing,'' said Jim Alley, senior
vice president for marketing at Tyco. ``We've developed a toy line
that is totally non-violent ... it's safe, it's fun and
non-violent.''
   Alley said there was only a ``remote possibility'' the
microphone, which sells for under $20, could be used for
eavesdropping because ``it only works in line of sight. ... It
won't work through walls, it won't work through windows and it
won't work through doors.''
   Alley said the full-size hand-operatied red boom mike can't be
concealed.
   The television advertisements for the microphone show two
children honing in on the sound of a man's whistling, but Charren
warned it could be used for other listening.
   ``That message of listening to somebody when he doesn't know
you're listening is one anybody can get from the advertisement,''
she said.
   Rudolph Brewington, a privacy advocate and Washington-based
free-lance journalist, said in an April 10 letter to Tyco president
Richard Grey that sale and advertisement of the toy ``amounts to
gross corporate irresponsibility.''
   The company is ``providing the means and encouragement to young
children to surreptiously spy on their unsuspecting playmates,
friends, families and neighbors,'' Brewington said.
   He contends the device violates both U.S. criminal law and
postal regulations that prohibit the manufacture, distribution or
sending through the mail devices that are ``primarily useful for
the purpose of the surreptitious interception of wire or oral
communications.''
   An aide to Rep. Ronald Dellums said the device would be illegal
under a bill proposed by the California Democrat.
   ``If a child was listening in on three of its playmates across
the playground that would be illegal,'' said George Withers,
legislative director for the congressman's Capitol Hill office.
   The proposal, the Privacy Assurance Act of 1989, would require
that all participants in a conversation consent to its interception
by listening or recording devices in instances not involved in law
enforcement cases.
   The bill, which has been referred to the House Judiciary
Subcommittee on Crime, would also require that sound- or
voice-activated recorders emit an audible beep-tone to alert a
speaker that his communication is being recorded.

<HEAD>Ag Department Says Wheat Production Could Increase Sharply</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat production could rise sharply this year
and help replenish dwindling U.S. stockpiles, an Agriculture
Department report said Wednesday.
   The wheat inventory on March 1 was the smallest in 15 years and
could be down to 442 million bushels by the start of the new
marketing year June 1, according to USDA estimates. That would be
the smallest June 1 wheat reserve since 1975.
   Analysts said that despite the tight supply situation, 1990
wheat prices through mid-March dropped about 10 percent, reflecting
prospects for a larger harvest this year.
   ``Winter wheat acreage seeded last fall was up nearly 4 percent
from a year earlier, and 71 percent of the crop was reported in
good or excellent condition as of mid-April,'' the report said.
   Farmers who normally plant spring wheat indicated in a survey
announced by USDA on March 30 that they intend to reduce their
acreage this year.
   As a result, the new report said, the total wheat acreage may be
up only 1.2 percent from last year.
   ``But some of last year's wheat area was counted twice because
farmers reseeded damaged winter wheat acreage with spring wheat,''
the report said. ``Thus, this year's area increase is understated.''
   Additionally, the report said, winter wheat states say that
``this season's winterkill has been lower, so harvested area may
post larger gains than planted area.''
   The larger harvested acreage, assuming per-acre yields recover,
points to a 1990 U.S. wheat crop ``substantially larger'' than last
year's 2.04 billion bushels. Production dropped to about 1.8
billion bushels in 1988, largely reflecting drought losses.
   Wheat market prices in the 1989-90 marketing year that soon will
end are forecast by USDA to average in the range of $3.70 to $3.75
per bushel, compared with $3.72 in 1988-89 and $2.57 in 1987-88.

   Development near Yellowstone National
Park is ``taking bites out of an ecological cookie,'' and an
apocalyptic group's giant fallout shelter is biting a critical
section, a park manager says.
   In addition to the church development, where 31,000 gallons of
fuel leaked last week, a gold mine recently opened just north of
Yellowstone and a large platinum mine operates 30 to 40 miles north
of the park. There also is talk of another gold mine opening near
the park's northeast corner. And in the summer of 1988, forest
fires scorched about a third of Yellowstone.
   ``If we can't hold the line in Yellowstone National Park on
these kinds of issues ... I'm not so sure we can save these kinds
of islands,'' said Stu Coleman, chief of resource management for
America's oldest national park.
   The fuel spilled at the Church Universal and Triumphant's
12,500-acre ranch, and Gardiner officials worried there may be more
spills.
   The church, whose members are preparing for a global nuclear
catastrophe, has brought in heavy machinery to build the huge
underground shelter complex in a high mountain meadow a few miles
north of Yellowstone.
   Park managers and local residents learned of the construction
last summer, and immediately expressed fear about potential
environmental consequences.
   Those fears were realized last week when diesel fuel and
gasoline spilled from three of 35 tanks buried next to the shelter.
State officials fear the remaining 32 tanks also may have been
damaged by shifting ground during the spring thaw.
   Church officials have brought in more equipment to clean up the
spill. State health officials said Tuesday they will seek a court
order to halt construction at the site. The department plans to
file its lawsuit on Friday.
   The spill occurred near a Yellowstone River tributary that is a
spawning stream for cutthroat trout. But the tributary enters the
Yellowstone downstream from the park, so any pollution would not
directly affect park waters.
   Of more concern is the impact of the complex and the cleanup on
the wild forest that stretches from the 2 million-acre park past
the shelters and far north into Montana.
   The southern Gallatin Range is considered critical habitat for
the federally protected grizzly bear. It is home to elk, moose,
deer, bald eagles and other species that inhabit the park.
   But increased human activity, like the extensive construction at
the shelter site and the intensive cleanup, will drive the bears
away, Coleman said.
   ``Grizzlies don't like to be in areas where people are,'' he
said.
   Coleman said the shelter is a prime example of potentially
damaging private development near park boundaries, nibbling away at
a protected ecosystem.
   ``I kind of liken development to taking a bite out of an
ecological cookie,'' he said. ``When someone wants to take a bite
out of the most important part of the cookie, then that's reason
for concern.''
   The church bought its ranch from publisher Malcolm Forbes in
1981. Since then, it has bought 18,000 more acres, moved its
headquarters here from Southern California and sponsored several
housing developments.
   Hundreds of followers have moved into the area, and many have
built fallout shelters at housing developments near Emigrant, a
ranching community 30 miles north of Gardiner.
   The church is led by Elizabeth Clare Prophet, who claims she
receives and passes on to members messages from a group of souls
known as the Ascended Masters. She warned her followers that March
and April would be dangerous times.
   The group owns some of the area's best winter range for elk,
deer, bison and antelope, Coleman said. During winter, these
animals migrate out of the park into lower valleys and rangeland
north of Gardiner.
   ``It's kind of hard because we don't own all that pasture, and
we're trying to take care of the animals on that pasture,'' Coleman
said.
   In late 1986, church developments near Gardiner were halted when
the state conducted a two-year environmental review. As part of the
review, the church agreed to mitigate the impacts of its projects
on wildlife.
   But construction of the shelter was not included. Church
officials said they didn't decide to build the shelter until after
the review was completed in March 1989.
   State officials said they'd been duped, and decided earlier this
year to reopen the review.
   Church officials have said they won't occupy the fallout shelter
area, except in case of emergency, and so don't expect to have a
significant effect on wildlife.
   They have often labeled park officials' comments as
hypocritical, pointing to six major developments in the park,
including hotels.
   ``Two wrongs don't make a right,'' Coleman responded. He said
park officials have tried to adjust the placement of developments
in wildlife areas.

<HEAD>Lithuania Refuses to Rescind Laws, But Asks Negotiations</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Lithuania refused Wednesday to bow to Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's ultimatum that it rescind independence-oriented laws,
but offered to pass no more such measures if the Kremlin starts
immediate talks.
   There were no signs that Gorbachev's threatened economic
sanctions against the Baltic republic had been implemented, with
critical oil and gas supplies flowing normally at its refineries
and pipelines.
   Soviet Deputy Oil and Gas Minister Aklim Mukhamedzyanov told the
Tass news agency that reports of an energy cutoff to Lithuania
``are completely groundless.'' He said the Soviet Council of
Ministers issued no such orders.
   After Lithuania's Supreme Council legislature approved its
official response to Gorbachev, Lithuanian President Vytautas
Landsbergis warned him that an oil and gas embargo would hurt other
republics as well as Lithuania.
   ``An economic blockade would influence Latvia, Estonia and the
Kaliningrad region of Russia,'' Landsbergis was quoted as telling a
news conference.
   ``That would resemble an angry man beating himself,'' Eduardas
Potasinskas of Lithuanian TV quoted Landsbergis as saying.
   But anticipating a possible Soviet embargo, the Supreme Council
urged Lithuanian factories and consumers to ``prepare themselves
for spiritual endurance and strict economy on all consumption.'' It
did not annouce specific conservation measures.
   At the end of two days of sometimes heated debate, the Supreme
Council drafted a letter to Gorbachev promising that if talks began
before May 1, it would not pass any more measures to implement its
March 11 declaration of independence.
   That offer represented an effort to compromise with Moscow, but
was unlikely to be accepted by the Soviet leadership.
   In their resolution _ titled ``On the Expansion of Relations
Between the Republic of Lithuania and the U.S.S.R.'' _ members of
the Supreme Council reaffirmed their declaration of independence,
and also appealed to Gorbachev not to use violence against
Lithuanians or impose the economic sanctions he threatened on
Friday.
   Gorbachev said that unless Lithuania rolled back several laws
supporting the declaration of independence, he would impose an
embargo on key supplies to the Baltic republic of 3.8 million
residents.
   He did not spell out what materials would be cut off, saying
only that they would be those goods the Soviet Union sells abroad
for hard currency _ meaning oil and natural gas.
   Lithuania is entirely dependent upon the Soviet Union for all
its oil and gas, and petroleum products are the Soviet Union's most
profitable export.
   Lithuania's energy minister, Leonas Asmantas, said Wednesday
that oil and gas were being delivered as usual.
   The day before, Asmantas reported receiving unofficial
information that crude oil supplies and natural gas would be
reduced Wednesday. In addition, Lithuanian gas officials said they
received a telegram from a regional Soviet energy official stating
that supplies of natural gas would be curtailed sharply on the
orders of the government.
   Lithuanian TV reported that residents saw Soviet troops in
several armored vehicles stopped Wednesday morning near a pumping
station at the Mazheikiai refinery in the northwestern part of the
republic, but there was no interruption of service, Potasinskas
said. The presence of soldiers at the site was unusual, he added.
   Sales of gasoline to Lithuanian motorists have tripled this week
as residents reacted to Gorbachev's threat with panic-buying, but
stocks were adequate and no rationing was anticipated, Asmantas
said.
   Gorbachev's 48-hour deadline passed Sunday night amid the
three-day Easter holiday in the heavily Roman Catholic republic.
The Supreme Council did not convene until Tuesday, although
Landsbergis and other leaders held an emergency meeting Monday to
assess the impact of an economic embargo.
   It was the latest in a series of ultimatums Gorbachev has issued
since Lithuanians declared their independence. In most cases, such
as a demand that they surrender their private firearms, he has not
reacted when they refused to give in.
   In addition to the threats, the Kremlin has sent tanks and
military vehicles through Lithuania's capital, Vilnius, rounded up
Lithuanins who deserted from the Red Army, seized buildings and
barred Western journalists from Lithuania.
   In Washington, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said action
by Moscow against Lithuania could doom commercial relations between
the Soviet Union and the United States.
   ``It's very difficult to see some of the commercial aspects of
our relationship surviving the use of force or coercion'' against
Lithuania, Baker said.
   In a separate letter to Gorbachev, the Lithuanian legislature
expressed ``regrets on the position and methods chosen by the
U.S.S.R.''
   ``On our part, as earlier, we are prepared to discuss any
issues, taking into consideration all justified interests of the
Soviet Union, foremost those of its citizens and those of a
strategic nature,'' the letter said.
   Legislators said they were forming a delegation led by Bronius
Kuzmickas, vice president of the Supreme Council, to travel to
Moscow for possible talks. A previous delegation met with Gorbachev
adviser Alexander N. Yakovlev but made no headway toward settling
the dispute.
   Lithuania picked up support Wednesday from neighboring Poland,
with the Solidarity delegation to the Polish parliament adopting a
resolution expressing concern over the ``growing pressure'' being
exerted by Moscow.
   The delegation also suggesting that Warsaw assist in
negotiations between the republic and the Kremlin.

   Here is the text of the resolution adopted
Wednesday by Lithuania's Supreme Council, or parliament. The
resolution was translated into English by the parliament:
   
   Resolution of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Lithuania
   On the Expansion of Relations Between the Republic of Lithuania
and the Soviet Union
   The Supreme Council of the Republic of Lithuania, in confirming
its loyalty to the acts of March 11, 1990, and consistently
striving for the consolidation of the independence of the Republic
of Lithuania, being convinced that solutions satisfactory to both
the Soviet Union and Lithuania can be found only by an avenue of
dialogue, resolves:
   1. Not to adopt new political legislative acts during the period
of preliminary parliamentary consulations between Lithuania and the
U.S.S.R., if they were to begin, until May 1, 1990.
   2. To invite the Soviet Union to refuse to use any type of
coercion, as well as economic, against the Republic of Lithuania
and its citizens.
   3. To suggest that the Soviet Union begin consultations
concerning negotiations with a delegation empowered by the Republic
of Lithuania.
   4. To send a delegation empowered by the Supreme Council of the
Republic of Lithuania and led by the Vice-President of the Supreme
Council of the Republic of Lithuania, Bronius Kuzmickas, concerning
the conditions of negotiations.
   5. To urge industrial organizations and citizens of Lithuania to
already prepare themselves for spiritual endurance and strict
economy on all consumption.

<HEAD>Experts Endorse Use Chemotherapy to Treat Advanced Colon Cancer</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   A chemotherapy combination that includes a
drug used to deworm farm animals was endorsed Wednesday by a panel
of experts as a standard treatment after patients in a late stage
of colon cancer undergo surgery.
   Twelve cancer specialist assembled by the National Institutes of
Health recommended that all physicians offer the drug combination
of 5-fluorouracil, or 5-FU, and levamisole to patients who have
been surgically treated for stage III colon cancer.
   The recommendation, in effect, endorses as standard treatment a
chemotherapy that was tested in a National Institute of Cancer
clinical trial that ended in October.
   That national trial among 1,300 patients found that 5-FU and
levamisole reduced death and cancer recurrence by up to a third.
   Levamisole is a drug widely used to remove worms from the
intestinal tract of cows, horses, goats, sheep and even elephants;
5-FU is a standard cancer drug that has been used for about 30
years.
   ``The battle has not been won'' in colorectal cancer, said Dr.
Glenn D. Steele Jr., a Harvard professor who chaired the panel of
specialists.
   ``Many, many answers still need to come in before we are even
close to winning the battle once someone is diagnosed with colon or
rectal cancer.''
   One of the unanswered questions, he said, is how exactly
levamisole works to reduce the recurrence of colon cancer. The
precise action of the drug in cancer treatment is not known.
   ``It's a little disquieting to not understand why it works,''
said committee member Dr. David P. Winchester, a Chicago physician
and a director of the American College of Surgeons.
   But Steele said the consensus panel said it felt there was
enough clinical evidence to merit recommending the combination for
stage III colon cancer.
   The panel also recommended that surgery alone be used to treat
patients in stage I of the disease, suggesting the use of both
chemotherapy and radiation for stages II and III of rectal cancer.
The experts also called for more clinical drug trials to better
define treatment combinations for patients at all disease stages
after surgery.
   Post-surgical therapy for colorectal cancer patients has been an
area of intense study among physicians worldwide for decades, but
clincial drug trials have failed until recent years to show the
additional treatment to be of any benefit.
   Because of poor results and severe toxic reactions to some
chemotherapies, many patients are treated only with surgery. For
late stage patients, the cancer almost invariably returns.
   Colon and rectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer
death in the United States. There are more than 150,000 new
colorectal cancers diagnosed annually.
   Of the new cases, the panel said, about 55,000 colon cancer
patients and 20,000 rectal cancer patients are defined as high
risk. About half of that high risk group will die within five years.
   In its report, the committee said that 5-FU and levamisole
appears to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence by 41 percent and
lower the overall death rate by 33 percent.
   ``Overal survival percentages at 3{ years were estimated to be
71 percent vs. 55 percent for the control group,'' the report said.
The control group received no chemotherapy.
   Side effects from 5-FU and levamisole, the committee said,
``were well tolerated.''
   The panel said it found that patients at stage I of colon cancer
had a survival rate of 80 percent to 90 percent after five years
with surgery alone. Thus, the experts said post-surgical therapy
for this early stage of the disease was not recommended.
   Levamisole is available for human consumption in the United
States only from the National Institute of Cancer. The NCI started
providing the drug free to the physicians of stage III colon cancer
patients in October after ending the national trial of the drug.
   The drug, manufactured by a Belgium company, is expected to be
available for general prescriptions this summer, said NCI spokesman
Dr. Mike Hamilton. He said the delay is caused by a manufacturing
problem with packaging.
   Steele said the consensus panel recommended that physicians
adopt a standard scale for evaluating the stages of colorectal
cancer.
   The scale uses the size and spread of the primary tumor, the
involvement of lymph nodes and the presence of metastasis, or
spread to distant organs, to classify the disease stage. The scale
ranges from stage zero to stage IV.

<HEAD>Soviet Threat Lessens, Third World Challenges Increase</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has a ``significantly
decreased'' capability of winning a conventional war against NATO
because of Moscow's eroding confidence in its Warsaw Pact allies,
the Joint Chiefs of Staffs said Wednesday.
   The chiefs, in their first international threat assessment since
the Berlin Wall was opened in November, said the likelihood of a
conventional war escalating into a nuclear one ``continues to
decline.''
   The annual study, prepared by Gen. Colin Powell, the chairman of
the joint chiefs, is supposed to present a ``big picture'' for the
military in planning defense strategies and budgets.
   Congress was given a classified version of the report last month.
   The report comes amid calls from lawmakers for sharp cuts in
Pentagon spending in light of reduced superpower tensions and
repeated warnings from Defense Secretary Dick Cheney that caution
should be used as fiscal constraints force changes in the nation's
defenses.
   The study expresses a restrained sense of optimism about the
revolutionary changes that have swept across Eastern Europe and the
Soviet Union.
   ``A dramatically different security environment is emerging that
is principally characterized by a diminished Soviet threat, reduced
defense resources and an increasingly complex world,'' the study
stated. ``These realities imply a reshaping of U.S. security
policy, strategy, force posture and capabilities.''
   But the study also tempers such observations with warnings that
the United States must be ``wary and ready'' in case Soviet reforms
are reversed or U.S. security interests are challenged by threats
from other sources, such as drugs, terrorism, regional conflicts or
Third World nations armed with ballistic missiles.
   ``The challenge is to reconcile enduring objectives and tasks
with repostured and restructured forces without foreclosing options
for hedging against new or renewed threats,'' concluded the study,
which is formally titled the ``Joint Military Net Assessment.''
   The report says that while the transformation of domestic and
foreign Soviet policies ``is incomplete and may be reversible,''
there is a ``broad agreement that the Soviet leadership has decided
to reverse a 20-year pattern of growth in military spending and
force posture.''
   The study notes that while the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact
have ``significant force advantages, unilateral force reductions
and political change in Eastern Europe are eroding the Soviets'
capability to conduct successful, sustained conventional operations
against NATO. Additionally, their confidence in the reliability of
non-Soviet Warsaw Pact forces ... is diminished.''
   Thus, the study states, ``the Soviets have to consider the
prospect that they would have to conduct a theater offensive
against NATO primarily on their own. ... Consequently, their
capability to accomplish theater strategic objectives is
significantly decreased.''
   In the unlikely event that such a war did occur, ``the potential
for termination of such a conflict on terms favorable to the United
States is much improved,'' the study said.
   It also said that ``the probability that NATO would need to
resort to the use of nonstrategic nuclear forces is assessed to
decrease'' as conventional-force reductions produce a better
balance between the armies of Eastern and Western Europe.
   But the foundation of the U.S. strategy of deterrence remains
its triad of nuclear weapons, the study said.
   ``Investment in a ballistic missile defense system is needed as
a minimum to counter the possibility of a Soviet missile attack
against the United States and the potential caused by the
proliferation of advanced missile systems among Third World
nations,'' the report said.
   Yet in the same paragraph, the study added: ``In any case, the
risk of nuclear deterrence failing is assessed to be low and at
this moment to be decreasing.''

<HEAD>Union: Air Traffic Control Center Short on Chairs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STANLEY D. MILLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After being plagued for years by a shortage of
controllers, Chicago's air traffic control center has enough
people, but members of the controllers union said Wednesday there's
another problem: not enough chairs.
   During one shift last week at the Chicago Air Route Traffic
Control Center in suburban Aurora, one controller sat on a wooden
box because no more chairs were available, said union chapter
Chairman Jim Poole.
   The center handles more than 2 million planes a year, including
cross-country flights and flights into and out of O'Hare
International, the nation's busiest airport.
   The lack of chairs poses no danger to air safety and no
controllers have been injured, said officials with the Federal
Aviation Administration and the union, the National Air Traffic
Control Association. But FAA spokesman Mort Edelstein said there's
a nationwide problem with broken chairs.
   ``We bought 10,000 of these chairs from 1985 to 1986. Five
percent to 9 percent are considered not usable today, and about 20
percent are considered broken but usable,'' Edelstein said.
   ``The agency has had difficulty getting replacement parts for
broken chairs,'' he said. ``They have to go to Oklahoma City for
the parts, and there's a backlog of orders.''
   Ron Downen, a union representative at the Aurora center, said
there were at least 12 broken chairs among the 121 chairs he
counted in the control room on a shift this week when 143 people
were on duty. The center employs about 400 controllers, said FAA
spokesman Mike Ficocello.
   Not all the controllers on the shift were handling planes
because of lunch breaks, rest breaks and training sessions, so all
working controllers had chairs, Downen said.
   But bad weather or computer troubles could require more
controllers at radar screens at once, threatening a chair shortage,
he said.
   ``We need more chairs before the thunderstorm season hits,''
said Kevin Christy, another union area representative.
   The FAA believes the center has enough usable chairs, said
spokesman Bob Buckhorn in Washington.
   ``We do have a problem in maintenance, and we're expediting a
program to ensure those broken chairs are either fixed or
replaced,'' Buckhorn said. ``Anywhere we find a shortage of chairs,
we're taking steps to correct that. ``It's not interfering with the
operation of the center,'' he said.
   The chairs were designed to reduce fatigue and aid posture, and
were the best chairs available that met controllers' requirements,
Buckhorn said.
   But Christy said the chairs aren't as sturdy as the ones they
replaced.
   ``They get hard use because they're sat in 24 hours a day,
rocked back and forth, rolled across the aisles,'' Christy said.
``But the chairs weren't built to last. They don't even look sturdy.
   ``The arms are falling off, the wheels are getting stuck and the
backs break off. They're comfortable, but they replaced chairs we
had years ago that were comfortable, too, and could stand a lot of
abuse.''
   The FAA has had trouble in the past filling vacancies at the
center because it is one of the busiest in the air traffic control
network. But a program giving controllers at busier centers extra
pay has largely eliminated the problem.

   Bush administration officials challenged
presidents of historically black colleges and universities
Wednesday to inspire 10 percent of their students to seek
collegiate teaching careers.
   ``We've got to do something about faculty members in higher
education institutions,'' said Leonard Haynes III, assistant
education secretary for post-secondary schools.
   ``If you would just put a target of 10 percent of your student
body and cause them to want to go on to get a masters and
doctorate, we will solve the shortage of black Ph.D.s in a period
of five to seven years,'' said Haynes, alluding to statistics that
show only four blacks nationwide received doctorates in mathematics
in 1988.
   Haynes told the conference that ``too many of our students now
are from the `Now Generation.'
   ``They want everything right now. They don't want to pay for it.
They don't want to work for it. They just want. That's going to
kill us ... unless we correct it.''
   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos said black institutions now
graduate 40 percent of all black Americans receiving baccalaureate
degrees.
   ``Black colleges have produced tens of thousands of outstanding
minority teachers over the years, and can help to develop new
programs for effective teaching in America's culturally and
ethnically diverse classrooms,'' said Cavazos.
   A 1988 Education Department survey of faculties in higher
education institutions found that whites accounted for 89 percent
of the 489,164 fulltime regular faculty members and 90 percent of
the 175,589 part-time regular faculty members.
   Asians comprised 4 percent of the fulltime faculty, blacks 3
percent, Hispanics 2 percent, and American Indians 1 percent.
   The Agriculture Department, meanwhile, said an agreement was
signed with Southern University and A&amp;M College, Baton Rouge, La.,
as part of a campaign to attract more black students to USDA
careers.
   Officials said the department's Agricultural Marketing Service
will oversee about $500,000 in appropriated and private funds next
fiscal year for teaching, research and recruitment of black
graduates of Southern University.
   Deputy Secretary Jack C. Parnell said USDA will hire about 600
interns this summer from the 16 historically black land-grant
universities chartered under the 1890 Morrill Act and from Tuskegee
University in Alabama.

   Families of the 47 sailors killed in the USS
Iowa explosion last April 19 began arriving here Wednesday for a
memorial service, and some voiced support for the Navy's handling
of the disaster a year ago.
   At a news conference, family members said they believe the
Navy's controversial conclusion that the battleship explosion was
likely caused by sabotage by a disgruntled gunner's mate who died
in the blast.
   ``I'm in total agreement with the report. I think the Navy did a
thorough job. ... I don't believe there was any cover-up,'' said
John Hague, whose stepson, Lt. j.g. Philip Buch, died in the
explosion.
   The news conference was attended by five people representing
three families. Other families of the victims have said they
disagree with the Navy's findings.
   According to the Navy, Gunner's Mate Clayton Hartwig was
suicidal and disgruntled at his treatment by the Navy. That
assessment was based on a psychological profile done by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.
   The Navy theorized Hartwig slipped a chemical detonator between
the bags of powder in the center 16-inch gun in gun turret No. 2.
Seconds before the turret was scheduled to fire a training salvo
off the coast of Puerto Rico, the explosion occurred, sending a
fireball racing down the six decks of the turret. The blast
instantly killed most of the men inside the giant gun.
   Hartwig's sister, Kathy Kubicina, has crusaded to clear her
brother's name. She has been joined by other family members of
victims and some legislators in questioning the Navy's
investigation.
   Earlier this year, a subcommittee of the House Armed Services
Committee issued a report saying the Navy's conclusions were not
supported by the facts.
   ``I found it deplorable that the Navy would stretch the facts to
force a conclusion that blamed it on a sailor,'' said former
Secretary of the Navy John Lehman. Lehman brought the World War II
battleship out of retirement as part of the buildup to a 600-ship
Navy under President Reagan.
   Kathy Miller, whose son Todd Miller died in the explosion, said
she was upset that Ms. Kubicina appeared to be speaking for all the
parents when she challenged the Navy's report.
   ``She does not speak for all of us. You're going to have 47
different opinions about what might have happened. But the point is
not to rehash it any longer. We can't be hostage to our grief,''
she said.
   The families were to meet privately Wednesday night and again
Thursday after a private memorial service.
   Hague, a resident of Las Mesa, N.M., said one item on the
families' agenda is a request that the Navy to donate the ship for
a museum.
   ``We need to do something positive to help us deal with our
grief. This has been my therapy,'' he said.

<HEAD>Bush Foresees Action on Global Warming; Critics Hail ``Common
Ground''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, responding to criticism of his
global warming policy, told an international conference Wednesday
he has ``never considered research a substitute for action.''
   The president's remarks at the close of the 18-nation White
House conference were warmly received by many of the same delegates
who a day earlier criticized the administration for failing to deal
directly with global warming.
   ``We came here to find common ground and we've found common
ground _ that research and action are inseparable,'' Padraig Flynn,
environnment minister from Ireland and an official of the European
Community, told reporters.
   Bush opened the conference Tuesday saying more research is
needed before costly programs are set up to fight global warming.
But he closed the conference by challenging his critics _ many of
them European delegates and environmentalists observing the
conference _ over global warming.
   He said the United States is ``leading the search for response
strategies and working through the uncertainty of both the science
and the economics of climate change.''
   ``But there is one area where we will allow for no uncertainty,
and that is our commitment to action, to sound analysis and sound
policies,'' he said.
   ``Above all the climate change debate is not about `research
versus action' for we have never considered research a substitute
for action,'' Bush told the senior government officials from around
the world.
   ``To those who suggest we're only trying to balance economic
growth and environmental protection, I say they miss the point,''
Bush said. ``We are calling for an entirely new way of thinking, to
achieve both while compromising neither.'
   The two-day conference was marked by discord over whether there
should be specific commitments to reduce so-called greenhouse
pollutants, especially carbon dioxide. The United States maintained
the conference was aimed at focusing on the need for additional
research into global warming and its economic impact, not on
developing action plans.
   But after Bush's remarks, many of the European delegates
expressed hope that the U.S. position emphasizing research had
shifted closer to their own views: that industrial nations along
must reduce the manmade pollutants, such as carbon dioxide, which
scientists fear are causing a warming of the Earth.
   Hans Alders, the Dutch environment minister and one of the
strongest critics of the U.S. policy, said he was heartened by
Bush's closing remarks.
   ``At the beginning, there were remarks only about the need for
more scientific research and economic knowledge,'' said Alders.
``Now you get the impression he is saying we need action now and we
need more information. And I agree with that.''
   Rafe Pomerance, an environmentalist observing the conference for
the World Resources Institute, said the administration ``got a very
strong message from the European governments.''
   Senior administration officials called the two-day conference a
success because it allowed a frank exchange of ideas on the
scientific uncertainties about global warming and the question of
economic cost of both action and inaction was discussed.
   But disputes over the narrow focus of the conference agenda and
other matters prevented agreement on a conference summary report
and left a U.S. proposal for an ambitious international research
effort, including creation of a special institute for global
warming, not even considered.
   A draft of the U.S. proposal was briefly circulated Wednesday
morning, but then quickly withdrawn when it raised the ire of many
of the delegates. Michael Deland, chairman of the president's
Council on Environmental Quality and a conference co-chairman, said
the document was distributed by mistake.
   ``That was a complete misunderstanding,'' said Allan Bromley,
the president's science adviser and another conference co-chairman.
But Bromley prior to the conference had said the United States had
hoped such a proposal would win the endorsement of the conference.

   Subway gunman Bernhard Goetz volunteered some
advice Wednesday to the man who fatally shot a robber on a train
last week: Don't surrender to police.
   ``I think the guy has nothing to gain by turning himself in and
everything to lose,'' said Goetz, whose own case attracted national
attention as a symbol of vigilantism.
   Police reported no progress Wednesday in identifying the man who
fired on a group of four attackers late Thursday on a
Manhattan-bound subway train in downtown Brooklyn. One of the four
was killed; the others were not injured.
   Witnesses told police the gang beat and robbed the victim,
described as a white man about 50 years old, before he pulled out a
gun and opened fire. He fled at the next stop.
   Goetz shot and wounded four teens on Dec. 22, 1984, on a
Manhattan subway train. He claimed they were about to mug him; they
said they were panhandling.
   Goetz surrendered to police in New Hampshire nine days later,
setting off a legal nightmare that continues to this day.
   He was acquitted in 1987 of attempted murder, but convicted of a
weapons possession charge. He served 8{ months in jail.
   Goetz filed a new motion Wednesday in state Supreme Court, the
Bronx, seeking to dismiss a $50 million civil lawsuit against him
filed by Darrell Cabey, who was paralyzed and brain-damaged in the
1984 shooting.
   A hearing is set for April 27.

<HEAD>GM Expediting Electric Car Production, Smith Says</HEAD>

   General Motors Corp. is expediting development
of an electrically powered car in recognition of consumer demand
for a cleaner environment, chairman Roger B. Smith said Wednesday.
   The nation's largest automaker intends to be the first to
mass-market the vehicle, Smith said in a speech to the National
Press Club. GM unveiled a prototype vehicle, the Impact, in January.
   He refused to say when or where the car would be built or to
reveal technical information about the vehicle, saying he did not
want to tip off competitors. In the 1970s, GM announced it would
produce a 1985-model electric car, but it dropped that project long
before production.
   Smith said the goal is to manufacture a car that would match
today's safety and performance standards without the air pollution
of an internal combustion engine. Generation of the electricity, of
course, would create other pollution if fossil fuels were used in
the power plant.
   ``We have set an aggressive schedule for ourselves in order to
pull along the technological developments that we still need,''
Smith said.
   Still needed is a better battery, and Smith said that may
require joint development by automakers, utilities, battery
manufacturers and the federal government.
   Though obstacles remain, ``when we look at the strict clean-air
legislation that's now being proposed for many areas of the
country, we're convinced that the Impact has a bright future.''
   Smith defended the automobile industry's environmental record:
The average vehicle's weight has dropped by 27 percent, aerodynamic
efficiency has improved by one-third, transmissions and air
conditioning are more efficient, engines are electronically
controlled and burn less fuel while emitting 75 percent to 96
percent less pollution than the cars of 1970, the year of the first
Earth Day.
   ``The truth is that no one understands the importance of the
environment better than we,'' Smith said.
   His remarks were sharply criticized by environmental groups.
   ``For him to come here today and declare himself an
environmentalist is the height of hypocrisy,'' said Bill Magavern,
staff attorney for the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, at a
news conference after Smith's speech.
   Many of the improvements Smith mentioned resulted from laws and
regulations that the industry fought, said Robert Dewey of the
Environmental Action Foundation.
   ``The company's CEO says one thing and their lobbyists say
another,'' Dewey said.
   Automakers lobbied against new tailpipe standards sought by
environmentalists in a pending update of the Clean Air Act. The
industry also is gearing up to fight a Senate bill to boost cars'
minimum fuel efficiency from 27.5 miles per gallon to an average of
40 mpg.
   Smith said, ``We do oppose things that are not practical, things
that are not environmentally sound, over-regulation and things that
do not add to the welfare of our people.''

   Imprisoned soul singer James Brown was all
smiles when he stepped on stage Wednesday, not to sing, but to
discuss his new job counseling youths about drug abuse.
   Brown, 15 months into a six-year sentence for aggravated
assault, starts Thursday with the Aiken-Barnwell Counties Community
Action Commission in a work-release program.
   ``A lot of people know me, know my reputation and what I've been
involved in. I hope that together that we can bring a turnaround to
some of the problems that we have out there and make the people
aware that there is a place to go to get the help,'' Brown, 56,
told a news conference at the University of South Carolina.
   The ``Godfather of Soul,'' a two-time Grammy award winner, said
he chose the job from more than 400 offered because he wanted to
give something back to the community.
   ``I could have been in television, I could have been in a whole
lot of other things, but I want to be a part of something that
shows our concern and that we care,'' he said.
   Brown was transferred last week from the State Park Correctional
Center in Columbia to the minimum-security Lower Savannah Work
Center near Aiken.
   The self-proclaimed ``Hardest Working Man In Show Business''
will have an office and assistants, work from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.
and be transported by commission officials, said George Anderson,
executive director of the private, non-profit agency.
   Brown will earn $11,500 a year but his paychecks will be turned
over temporarily to the state Department of Corrections because
inmates can only keep $50, said department spokesman Francis X.
Archibald.
   Anderson said Brown will talk to school principals, students and
parents, address meetings and publicize the agency's programs,
which also include education and nutrition for pre-schoolers,
family services and job training.
   He said Brown's music reputation can help focus attention on the
area's poverty.
   But he cut short the news conference before Brown, who has been
arrested several times for drug use and possession, could answer
questions about his credibility as an advocate against subtance
abuse.
   ``There's no foregone conclusions on my part that Mr. Brown has
serious problems of the kind or nature that you allude,'' Anderson
told reporters.
   Brown will address his message to the poor communities of the
mostly wealthy Aiken County, which also is home to the Department
of Energy's Savannah River nuclear weapons production plant.
   At the news conference, Brown jokingly answered reporters'
queries: ``Oh, you want me to say I feel good. OK, I feel good.''
It was a reference to ``I Got You (I Feel Good),'' one of his 114
charted singles, which also include ``Papa's Got a Brand New Bag''
and ``I'm Black and I'm Proud.''
   Brown is serving concurrent six-year sentences in Georgia and
South Carolina for failing to stop for police, aggravated assault
and weapons violations stemming from a high-speed chase that
crossed state lines.
   The incident began when a gun-toting Brown stormed an insurance
agency next to his office and claimed strangers had used his
bathroom. Tests showed Brown had used the illegal drug PCP. He had
several previous drug arrests.
   Brown becomes eligible for parole in South Carolina in May 1991,
and in Georgia in March 1992.

   Gov. John Waihee is expected to fill the Senate
seat of the late Spark Matsunaga within about a week, and Rep.
Daniel Akaka is considered the leading candidate for the job.
   Waihee said earlier he would announce his selection after a
``decent interval'' following Matsunaga's funeral. Services were
held in Honolulu Wednesday, with private burial to follow on
Thursday.
   ``The governor won't let the seat go vacant very long,'' press
secretary Carolyn Tanaka said Wednesday. ``Maybe there will be an
announcement within a week.''
   Waihee, a Democrat like Matsunaga, has hinted that he wouldn't
mind leaving one of Hawaii's two House seats vacant for a while if
that was what it took to fill the Senate seat.
   Speculation by political observers centers on Akaka. Waihee
acknowledged to news reporters that the Democratic congressman
would be a logical choice, and Akaka has said he would consider the
appointment, if offered.
   The interim successor named by Waihee will serve until a special
election in conjunction with the Sept. 22 primary and Nov. 6
general elections. The winner of that election will serve the
remainder of Matsunaga's term, which continues through 1994.
   Hawaii's other U.S. House seat is held by Republican Patricia
Saiki, who has expressed interest in Matsunaga's Senate seat.
   Matsunaga, 73, died Sunday at a hospital in Toronto where he had
been undergoing treatment for cancer.

   A rifle-fired grenade slammed into a
schoolbus and exploded during Christian factional fighting
Wednesday, killing 11 schoolchildren and at least four other people.
   ``The driver was burning as the bus hit the sidewalk,'' mumbled
one dazed witness.
   ``Many of the pupils yelled for help as we tried to extinguish
the fire. At least one teacher also was among the dead along with
the driver,'' said a soldier at the scene.
   A police spokesman said the bus was hit while crossing into
Christian east Beirut in the afternoon. It was bringing children
back from school in south Beirut. The grenade ignited the fuel tank.
   ``It couldn't be determined who fired the rifle grenade,'' said
the spokesman, who cannot be named in line with regulations.
   Gen. Michel Aoun's radio station accused gunmen of Samir
Geagea's Lebanese Forces militia of firing at the bus, but Geagua's
command denied responsibility.
   Aoun and Geagea have been involved in a bloody power struggle
for control of the 310-square-mile Christian enclave for more than
two months. The showdown has killed 892 people and wounded 2,388
since it started Jan. 30. Most victims have been civilians.
   The police spokesman said the bus belonged to the Mraijeh
Elementary School, a new private school in south Beirut.
   It was not immediately clear why students from predominantly
Christian east Beirut were attending school in south Beirut, a
Shiite Moslem stronghold.
   The gutted wreckage of the yellow bus straddled a curb in an
Aoun-controlled area, a few yards east of the gateway. It is the
only crossing linking Christian east Beirut and Moslem west Beirut.
   The smell of incinerated metal hung in the air as flies buzzed
in the darkened interior of the bus.
   A torn, striped green and blue sweater lay on the blackened
springs of the burned out bus. The wheels of the bus had melted.
   Sheets of paper from a grade book lay scattered on the driver's
seat. The names of the students were burned off. Only their grades
remained, written neatly in red and blue ink.
   The army private, one of the soldiers serving under Aoun, said
he and his colleagues ``doused off the burning bus with water and
we evacuated the victims to nearby hospitals.''
   The bus was hit a few hours after a thunderous blast ripped
through Aoun's Defense Ministry in east Beirut's suburb of Yarze,
killing at least two men.
   Aoun's forces said in a communique the Defense Ministry blast
occurred when soldiers were moving confiscated ammunition, but they
did not say if it was an accident. Moslem radio reports said the
explosion was aimed at Aoun's troops.
   The rival Christian factions dueled intermittently throughout
the day with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades in east
Beirut and the Kesrouan highlands, the police spokesman said.
   Aoun opposes the government of President Elias Hrawi, formed
last fall under terms of an accord aimed at ending Lebanon's
15-year-old civil war.
   Aoun says he opposes the plan because it lacks a timetable for
the withdrawal of Syria's estimated 40,000 troops backing Moslems
and the Hrawi government.
   Geagea has recognized Hrawi's authority.
   In other Beirut violence Wednesday, rival Shiite Moslem militias
loyal to Iran and Syria fought a 90-minute gunbattle in west
Beirut. Police said one person was killed and four wounded.
   Police, in an updated casualty count, said 12 people have been
killed and 52 wounded since the latest round of the Amal-Hezbollah
clashes broke out Tuesday.
   The police spokesman said most of the casualties were civilians,
including children caught in the cross-fire across densely
populated residential districts.
   Amal and Hezbollah have been fighting on-and-off for more than
two years for mastery of the 1.2 million Shiites, Lebanon's largest
sect.

<HEAD>Survivor of Capsized Fishing Boat Says `Voices' Kept Him Going</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A commerical fisherman whose boat capsized
said Wednesday he frequently heard voices and prayed a lot during
the five days he spent floating in a wooden box without food.
   Nathan Neesmith, 32, of Darien, told reporters he didn't know
why the 34-foot boat Casie Nicole sank early Thursday.
   ``All I know is water came in, and it came in fast,'' said
Neesmith, still appearing fatigued on his third day of
hospitalization.
   Neesmith said that as he drifted in the Atlantic, he splashed
water on his face and tried to avoid drinking the salt water. He
felt at times he would not survive.
   ``I heard people talking to me,'' Neesmith said. ``I drifted
along. I heard people yelling out, `Nathan!' I'd jump up and look
around. I thought it was somebody. Here I am looking around, and it
was only the good Lord keeping me awake.''
   Earlier Wednesday, the Coast Guard said it suspended its search
for three missing crew members, including Neesmith's brother and
nephew.
   Neesmith was rescued Monday about 20 miles east of Hilton Head
Island, S.C.
   He was in fair condition Wednesday at Memorial Medical Center in
Savannah, where he was being treated for hypothermia and
dehydration. Dr. Carl Boyd, director of the trauma center, said he
expected Neesmith to make a full recovery and to be released this
weekend.
   The boat was found Monday night by a Coast Guard plane about 45
miles off the coast, said Petty Officer 2nd Class Brett Farrell.
   A subsequent search turned up only a life vest and a sleeping
bag, about five miles from where Neesmith was rescued, said Petty
Officer 2nd Class Anthony Brown of the Coast Guard rescue station
on Tybee Island.
   Neesmith said he and his companions were about 65 miles offshore
when the boat began taking on water. He left the others with food
and a raft, and set out to get help.
   He said he was confident the others will be found.
   ``People are praying for us all over the world, and if they can
be found we're gonna find them ... we're sure gonna try anyway,''
Neesmith said.
   The Coast Guard said the search was suspended pending any new
developments.
   Missing were Neesmith's brother, Billy Joe Neesmith, 23; his
nephew, Keith Wilkes, 18; and Franklin Brantley, 23, all of Darien.

<HEAD>Execution Date Set for Prejean</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAFAYETTE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man sentenced to death 12 years ago as a
teen-ager is to go to the electric chair on May 18, a judge decided
after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected his latest round of appeals.
   Dalton Prejean, a two-time killer who has been on death row
longer than any inmate in Louisiana, is to die for the 1977 murder
of state Trooper Donald Cleveland.
   Prejean's case has been championed by death penalty opponents
who say he should be spared because he is nearly retarded, with an
IQ of 76, and because he was a teen-ager at the time the trooper
was killed. Prejean is now 30.
   The U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay last November but on
Monday the high court rejected his most recent appeal. State
District Judge Hugh Brunson set the execution date Tuesday.
   Prejean has been in prison since the death of Cleveland, who had
stopped an automobile in which Prejean was a passenger because of a
broken taillight. Prejean was 17 at the time and already had served
time in a reform school for murdering a taxi driver when he was 14.
   Defense attorneys claim that Prejean suffered mental retardation
from beatings he received as a child. They also said he feared for
his life when Cleveland stopped the auto.
   Prejean told the Louisiana Pardon Board last November that he
regretted shooting Cleveland and that ``I can't give back a human
life that was very valuable (but) to kill me will not solve the
problem.''
   The board voted 3-2 to spare Prejean's life, but Gov. Buddy
Roemer rejected the recommendation.
   Some people who served on the jury at Prejean's 1978 trial said
this week the execution should go on.
   William Sayre of Monroe said he was galled by the numerous stays
of execution granted Prejean over the years.
   ``We voted that he should die for what he did,'' said Sayre.
``He shot that officer in cold blood.''
   Several jurors said they didn't know during the trial that
Prejean had killed a taxi driver at age 14. He was released from a
juvenile detention center six months before the trooper was killed.
   Eugene Koontz of Monroe, another juror, said it was unfair that
the jury didn't have the information about the earlier crime.
   ``It's time for this to end,'' said Koontz.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III appeared
to welcome on Wednesday reports that a pro-Iranian group would free
an American hostage, but the White House rejected the group's
demand that a senior U.S. diplomat fly to Damascus to take part.
   Diplomatic sources also said an American would be freed on
Friday in the Syrian capital.
   The Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine, which is
believed to hold three of the eight American captives, demanded
that Assistant Secretary of State John Kelly hurry to Damascus ``to
coordinate some final steps to guarantee success within 48 hours.''
   But Baker said, ``At the present time, the Middle East is not on
his agenda.''
   And presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We
would not anticipate him becoming involved in hostage release in
any way.''
   Fitzwater said that Kelley was in Bonn, West Germany, ``on other
business. He's expected to return to the United States in a day or
two.''
   Kelly, who heads the Bureau of Near East and South Asian
Affairs, is attending a conference of U.S. ambassadors in Bonn. He
is a former ambassador to Lebanon, where all eight Americans are
believed to be held.
   ``Of course we're always hopeful,'' Baker said while reiterating
a longstanding U.S. demand that all eight Americans held in Lebanon
be released unconditionally.
   At the White House, Fitzwater said of the reports, ``We've had
this happen before. We've gone right up to the moment of supposed
release and it never happened. So we've long since learned not to
be too optimistic.''
   Like Fitzwater, Baker said, ``We've seen reports like this
before.''
   In this case, he added, ``I don't want to say anything that
might adversely affect any chances there are for release of any
hostages.''
   A U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said:
``When we see this hostage walk out, we'll believe it.''
   The Islamic Jihad did not say which of the three Americans it is
holding would be freed. Its statement was accompanied by an instant
photograph of Jesse Turner, of Boise, Idaho.
   The group also is believed to hold Alann Steen and Robert
Polhill. All were abducted from the grounds of Beirut University
Campus on Jan. 24, 1987. They are among 18 Westerners, including
the eight Americans, believed held by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon.
   Earlier Wednesday, David Denny, a State Department spokesman,
called the unconditional release of all hostages in Lebanon ``an
important humanitarian issue.'' He said he could not predict any
release at this point, and said ``nothing would be served by
speculation.''
   The spokesman added: ``We would, of course, welcome the release
of any hostage, as we continue to urge the release of all of them.''
   U.S. officials in making statements about the hostage situation
usually rule out any U.S. negotiations with the abductors for
release of their captives. Baker and Denny made no reference to
this point in their remarks.
   Meanwhile, a senior U.S. diplomat said the Bush administration
would ``respond to positive actions'' by Iran regarding release of
the hostages but would not reward the Tehran government for using
its influence to free the captives.
   Iran is understood to have considerable influence with the
Islamic Jihad.
   ``We are prepared to deal with the Islamic Republic without
nostalgia for the past,'' said Deputy Assistant Secretary of State
Edward Gnehm. ``We remain willing to talk directly to authorized
Iranian government representatives,'' he said.
   Gnehm did not refer to the reports about a possible hostage
release.
   The United States, Gnehm said at a seminar on the Persian Gulf,
believes Iran has significant influence over the hostage holders
and could do much more than the recent statements by Iranian
officials regarding the need to free the hostages. ``We're looking
for actions, not words,'' he said.

<HEAD>Administration Opposes Sanctions Against Iraq</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is seeking to defeat
proposed legislation that would impose economic sanctions against
Iraq, a top State Department official said Wednesday.
   Nonetheless, the United States has ``real doubts'' about recent
Iraqi actions, including alleged attempts to buy nuclear bomb
detonators and to assassinate government opponents, said Deputy
Assistant Secretary of State Edward Gnehm.
   ``We would like Iraq to take action to allay our concerns,''
Gnehm said at a seminar on the Persian Gulf.
   U.S.-Iraqi relations have been strained in recent weeks by a
series of events, among them a warning by Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein that his country would use chemical weapons against Israel
if attacked. The administration has criticized Saddam for making
``inflammatory'' statements.
   Anger at Iraq prompted calls in Congress for economic sanctions.
Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., is about to introduce a bill denying
Iraq any economic and military assistance. The draft legislation
has drawn considerable support from House Democrats, but several
leading Senate Republicans have voiced reservations and suggested
the administration talk to Saddam but not threaten him.
   Gnehm said the administration's ``policy on sanctions is to
oppose them.'' He added, ``Our objective will be to see that it
(the bill) doesn't pass.'' The administration is particularly
opposed to a provision in the draft bill that would ban credits and
loans by the government's Export-Import Bank for Iraqi agriculture,
he said.
   The administration is also concerned about a resolution expected
to be adopted Thursday by a House subcommittee condemning human
rights violations in Iraq. The measure was prompted by the hanging
last month of an Iranian-born British journalist accused of spying
for Israel and the United States.
   Last fall the United States and Iraq held high-level talks to
discuss expanding and improving their ties, which have been
strained at times since their renewal in 1984 after a 15-year
break. ``Since then, a series of disappointments have raised real
doubts in our mind about Iraqi intentions,'' Gnehm said.
   In particular, he cited last month's exposure of an Iraqi ring
allegedly trying to smuggle nuclear triggers for atomic bombs, an
alleged plot by an Iraqi diplomat at the United Nations to kill two
political opponents, and Saddam's threat to Israel.
   ``Iraq is an important country, with an important role to play
in the region,'' Gnehm said. But ``they cannot flout our laws ...
without us reassessing our relationship.''
   He said the United States is improving its methods for tracking
countries that violate U.S. export-control laws, including allies
like Israel and Egypt who have also been accused of trying to
smuggle devices to enhance their nuclear and ballistic missile
capabilities.

<HEAD>Planned Parenthood Administrator Resigns Over Proposed Amendment
Language</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The medical director for Planned Parenthood's
state chapter said Wednesday he resigned the post because a
pro-choice amendment to the Massachusetts constitution ``goes too
far.''
   Dr. Stanton Goldstein said he left the job because he could not
join the group in backing abortion rights ``at any time in cases of
rape or incest or to protect the life and health of the mother.''
   ``I cannot support an amendment that legalizes destructive
procedures of a healthy fetus in the third trimester,'' he said.
``I was in an administrative role in an organization that stood for
something politically that I could not agree with.''
   Goldstein stepped down Tuesday but will remain a staff doctor
with the pro-choice organization's two Massachusetts clinics, whose
administration he had overseen during the past five years.
   The longtime pro-choice activist said he believed many people
would find the proposed amendment broader than acceptable.
   ``It goes too far for me,'' he said. ``I as a physician believe
that a destructive procedure in the third trimester is either
unethical or immoral ... and therefore I am entering the public
debate.''
   Nicki Nichols Gamble, executive director of the state office of
Planned Parenthood, said she expected debate and disagreement but
regards ``the proposal as a fairly moderate one that captures the
status quo.''
   She said the organization would stand behind the proposed
amendment, which must be approved by a constitutional convention
and could go before voters in 1992.
   The language was adopted last September after months of
discussion among members of a ``Coalition for Choice,'' which
included Planned Parenthood, the League of Women Voters, the Civil
Liberties Union and the National Organization for Women.
   Coalition members initially filed seven different versions of
the amendment proposal _ some more and some less restrictive. A
compromise was reached after extensive polling to test public
support for each version.
   Susan Newsom, associate director of Planned Parenthood, said the
language ``is not the first choice for a lot of people.'' But she
said the number of abortions performed after the second trimester
was ``tiny.''
   Of 38,200 abortions performed in the state in 1986, nine were
late trimester abortions, according to the most recent figures by
the state Department of Public Health.
   Goldstein, however, put a different spin on the historically low
figure.
   ``I have several questions,'' he said. ``If the number of
abortions performed after the second trimester is so `tiny' then
why are we legislating for it? Is it so `tiny' because it has not
been legal up till now?''

<HEAD>Greenpeace Says Hundreds Of Naval Accidents Went Unreported</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Navy suffered 1,596 accidents
involving ships, submarines and aircraft in the 1980s, and nearly
two-thirds of them were not publicly reported, according to
Greenpeace USA.
   The environmental advocacy group said its study of previously
unreleased Navy records showed that 1989 was, ironically, one of
the Navy's safest years despite the April explosion which killed 47
sailors aboard the battleship USS Iowa and several other
headline-provoking accidents in the wake of that tragedy.
   Greenpeace, citing data obtained from the U.S. Navy Safety
Center under the Freedom of Information Act, said the Navy
registered 106 accidents last year, the fewest of any year in the
decade except 1988, when there were 83. The most, 248, occurred in
1981, it said.
   The Navy did not dispute the figures, though a statement from
Cmdr. Mark Baker, chief of the Navy Information Office, put the
count of ``major'' accidents last year at 69. By ``major,'' he
referred to what the Navy calls Class A accidents _ involving loss
of life, or property damage exceeding $1 million.
   The Greenpeace figures, according to author Joshua Handler,
counted Class B accidents as well _ property loss exceeding
$200,000 _ and a few ``significant'' Class C accidents involving
property damage of under $200,000.
   ``The Navy has been unrelenting in its pursuit of safety and
this has resulted in continued improvement during the decade of the
80s,'' said Baker. ``Our goal continues to be to make the Navy as
safe as possible.''
   A string of accidents last year led the Navy to take the
unprecedented step of ordering a two-day freeze of its operations
so officers and sailors could concentrate on safety reviews,
inspections and lectures.
   The Greenpeace report, released Wednesday, said the Iowa
explosion and the sinking of a Soviet Mike-class nuclear submarine
earlier in April made naval accidents a running news story in 1989,
ensuring press coverage of many of those which followed. ``But 991
U.S. naval accidents went unreported by the news media in the
1980s, almost two-thirds of the total for the decade,'' it said.
   ``Government secrecy still inhibits a full accounting of the
naval accident record,'' the report said. ``Information is still
too sketchy to determine the dangers accidents posed to nuclear
weapons or reactors, particularly since direct data about accident
trends for U.S. naval nuclear weapons and reactors continues to be
kept secret.''
   Still, ``the U.S. Navy provides more information that any other
country on its accident record,'' Greenpeace said. Despite unusual
Soviet candor over the fire which resulted in the loss of 42
sailors and their Mike-class sub in the Norweigian sea, the report
said, ``the Soviet record on disclosure is still horrendous.''
   Greenpeace estimated that the world's five nuclear navies _
including Great Britain, France and China _ together suffered 3,200
accidents in the 1980s, or almost one a day. The guess was based on
the number of U.S. accidents, 1,596, compared to the fleet sizes of
the other nations.
   It said about half the 99 ships and submarines involved in
documented accidents last year were nuclear powered, and,
similarly, about half were capable of carrying nuclear weapons.
American vessels accounted for 78 percent of the documented
episodes. Soviet ships and submarines were involved in 8 percent of
those cases, while those from Great Britain accounted for 7 percent.
   The report, while mentioning fatalities caused by accidents
previously reported, did not mention overall death tolls.
   But it did say:
   _The sinking of the Soviet Mike-class sub raised the total
number of nuclear warheads on the ocean floor from 48 to 50, with
43 of those from the Soviet Union and 7 from the United States. It
also raised the number of sunken naval nuclear reactors from 7 to
8, with 5 of those from the Soviet Union and three from the United
States.
   _Collisions, fires and explosions accounted for almost half of
the 439 accidents involving U.S. surface ships in the 1980s, with
the largest portion occurring in the Atlantic Ocean.
   _Forty percent of the U.S. naval accidents during the decade
involved submarines.

<HEAD>2nd Convoy Carrying Emergency Food Leaves for Ethiopia War Zone</HEAD>

   Another convoy left for the war zone in
northern Ethiopia with emergency supplies for thousands of people
threatened with famine, a relief worker said Wednesday.
   It was the second such convoy heading to Tigre province in two
days.
   Eighteen trucks carrying eight tons each left Dessie, the
capital of Wollo province, in the morning for Mekelle, capital of
neighboring Tigre province, said Ahmed Baghet, the deputy director
of the Catholic Relief Services in Ethiopia.
   Another convoy of 55 trucks, which left Dessie on Monday, was
reportedly unloading in Mekelle and was expected back in Dessie on
Thursday, Baghet said in a telephone interview from Nairobi.
   Those in Mekelle are among up to an estimated 6 million people
threatened with famine, mostly in Tigre and the northern province
of Eritrea.
   The rebel Tigre People's Liberation Front has controlled Mekelle
and the entire Tigre province since forcing government troops to
withdraw in February 1989.
   Mekelle is 170 miles north of Dessie and 320 miles north of
Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa.
   A consortium of three Ethiopian churches recently began
delivering emergency food to northern Wollo and Tigre after the
government and the rebels agreed on safe passage for relief convoys
behind the battle lines.
   Most of the trucks used in the operation, however, belong to the
U.S.-based Catholic Relief Services and the Lutheran World
Federation.
   The emergency food is donated by the United States and other
Western aid agencies.
   Monday's convoy, which Baghet said passed through the war zone
without incident, delivered the first emergency supplies to Mekelle
since the rebel takeover.
   Bhaget said the convoy was not in touch with Addis Ababa or
Dessie.
   ``But we heard from another truck that ours were unloading and
we consider the information reliable. Yes, report it,'' he said.
   Recently the Tigreans accused relief officials of citing bad
road conditions to delay the distribution of food in northern
Wollo, contested by the government and the rebels, and in Tigre.
   Bhaghet said the road conditions prevented trucks from using
trailers and forced them to carry half their maximum load.
   The Tigreans took up arms in 1975, seeking President Mengistu
Haile Mariam's overthrow and the establishment of a government
patterned after that of Albania, the last of the hard-line Marxist
states in Eastern Europe.
   The government is battling a larger rebel group, the Eritrean
People's Liberation Front, in northern province of Eritrea.
   The Eritreans captured the Red Sea port of Massawa in an
offensive in February, forcing donors to divert all emergency
supplies to Assab port, also on the Red Sea but much farther south.
   The Eritreans said in a clandestine radio broadcast Monday they
had repaired damage caused to the port in the fighting and appealed
to international donors to resume emergency shipments through the
port for distribution in Eritrea and northern Tigre.
   Massawa is Ethiopia's only deep sea port and the United Nations
had hoped to ship through the harbor 1.1 million tons of emergency
food to those threatened with famine.
   The rebels from Eritrea, a former Italian colony on the Red Sea,
have fought the government since Ethiopia incorporated it as a
province in 1962.

   Although American officials are calling the
two-day White House conference on global warming a success, it did
not occur without some embarrassing glitches.
   A copy of a White House ``talking points'' document on the
conference made its way to some of the environmental activists
monitoring the sessions. They quickly provided copies to reporters
and charged the White House was trying to put a false ``spin'' on
the global warming issue.
   The guidelines, presumably for administration officials
attending the conference, included a section on ``debates to
avoid.''
   It was not the first embarrassment for conference organizers.
   On the opening day, the Soviet Union was omitted from the list
of participants to the 18-nation conference, which was held at a
downtown hotel a few blocks from the White House.
   A Soviet official sought out EPA Administrator William Reilly
and wanted to know if it was an intentional slight. He was told,
according to one conference organizer, it certainly was not. The
Soviet Union in addition to being a superpower also is one of the
biggest producers of global warming pollutants.
   The ``talking points'' document, however caused the biggest stir
when it surfaced Wednesday.
   It suggested U.S. officials not talk about whether there is too
much warming of the Earth because ``in the eyes of the public we
will lose this debate.'' Instead, officials were advised to ``raise
the many uncertainties'' of the issue.
   Other things not to do, according to the White House guidelines:
   _``Don't get into an advocacy position of the merits of the
various policy proposals.''
   _``Don't use specific numbers (degrees, dollars, rates, etc.)''
when discussing how the conference is ``accelerating the
international discussion and understanding of these issues.''
   _Finally, ``don't let reporters position this conference as an
attempt to delay serious decisions on this issue.''
   Yet, much of the two-day conference focused on just such
criticism as European delegates chastized the Bush administration
for emphasizing research and not enough at the expense of
strategies to curb global warming.
   It wasn't clear who drew up the ``talking points,'' although
adminstration officials said they were authentic.
   ``I personally did not review (the document) and I certainly
didn't authorize it,'' said Michael Deland, the president's
chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality and a conference
co-chairman.
   Reilly said he frequently talks about many of the forbidden
subjects outlined in the ``don't'' section.
   And on Wednesday morning, an unnamed staffer mistakenly,
according to conference organizers, distributed a detailed U.S.
proposal for a broad-ranging research initiative to conference
delegates.
   ``It was circulated inadvertently,'' said Deland. He said the
staffer actually should have distributed copies of summary reports
from the various working sessions that had been underway.
   But enough of the European delegates saw the document before it
was withdrawn to cause another stir. The Europeans, already upset
because they believed they did not have opportunities to present
their views in public sessions, saw it as another effort to impose
an American outlook on the conference.
   ``I challenged the status and nature of the document,'' said
Padraig Flynn, environnment minister from Ireland and an official
of the European Community, ``and it was quickly and effectively
rubbished by William Reilly.''
   ``It was a complete misunderstanding,'' said Allan Bromley, the
president's science adviser and a conference co-chairman.

<TEXT>
   Bulldozers guarded
by Israeli soldiers leveled an orange grove Wednesday to ready a
new Jewish settlement for construction only a short distance from a
crowded Palestinian refugee camp.
   In Jerusalem, a group of Jewish settlers who moved into the old
walled city's Christian quarter ignored a court order to leave.
   The new settlement activity in Gaza drew a protest from Soviet
Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfilyev. He told reporters in
Moscow it showed ``some circles in Israel continue to deliberately
raise obstacles to a peaceful settlement in the Middle East.''
   U.S. officials have also called the construction of Israeli
settlements a threat to peace efforts. They have conditioned a $400
million housing loan for immigrants on assurances Soviet Jews will
not be settled in occupied areas.
   In Dugit, armed Jewish settlers from a nearby settlement watched
as the bulldozers smoothed out sand dunes and uprooted orange trees
for the trailer-type homes of 40 Israeli families who plan to move
in by the summer.
   Settlers said the orange trees were on state-owned land
allocated to Dugit, but the trees were apparently cultivated by
Gazan Arabs.
   The prefabricated housing is expected to arrive soon, according
to Arab workers who operated the earthmoving equipment.
   Dugit's future residents plan a tourist beach and yacht club on
the beachfront about a mile from their homes. The site replaces
another nearby that military officials rejected.
   ``These people want to bring their yachts, build a marina,
attract tourists,'' said Datia Hershkowitz, a settlement activist
in Gaza.
   ``The move was delayed when military officials designated the
original site, the prettiest beach in Gaza, too close to a
Palestinian refugee camp for proper security,'' she added.
   The Shati refugee camp, a beachside shantytown of 41,000
Palestinians, is only two miles from the Dugit site.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's spokesman Yossi Ahimeir said
Sunday, when Israel TV reported the final permits had been granted
for Dugit, that it was one of eight settlements agreed to by
Shamir's Likud and the center-left Labor Party when they formed a
government in 1988.
   Ahimeir said it was therefore wrong to consider Dugit's
establishment part of a new policy.
   Three settlements were built after the coalition government came
to power, but former Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Labor
postponed the ground-breaking of the other five.
   Leftist Parliament member Dedi Zucker said this week that in
addition to agreed-upon settlement plans, the government recently
authorized construction of Jewish housing in the West Bank town of
Nablus and expansion of a settlement near Hebron.
   The daily Maariv newspaper said Wednesday that Shamir aide
Michael Dekel had approved a request by settlers to expand Kfar
Adumim ``and in effect to open a new settlement'' in the West Bank.
   The fresh settlement activity prompted speculation that Shamir's
caretaker government was trying to accelerate the building effort
since Labor left the government March 13.
   Shamir aide Avi Pazner on Wednesday denied that Shamir knew in
advance about the plans of more than 150 Jewish settlers to
establish themselves in Jerusalem's Arab Christian quarter.
   Pazner also rejected a charge by left-wing lawmaker Yossi Sarid
that Shamir had ordered the police not to evacuate the settlers
when a judge upheld an eviction order Tuesday.
   The settlers in Jerusalem ignored a court-ordered deadline for
them to leave, contending the law gives them 21 days to appeal.
   As the 9 a.m. deadline expired, a dozen paramilitary police
relaxed outside the four stone buildings that are owned by the
Greek Orthodox Patriarchate. The church maintains that a tenant
illegally sold the rights to the building to the Jews.
   David Bason, a lawyer for the Greek Orthodox Church, said the
order required the settlers to leave immediately and threatened to
take legal action against the police unless they acted to enforce
the court order.
   ``The problem is the police are very lazy. They want us to make
the eviction,'' said Bason, an Israeli lawyer.
   Police spokesman Uzi Sandori could not be reached for immediate
comment on whether police would evict the settlers.
   The Jews' move into the 72-room complex a week ago set off angry
protests by Palestinians and church officials. The move upset a
delicate balance in which Christians, Moslems and Jews live in
jealously guarded separate quarters.
   The dispute has political overtones since the old city is part
of the land captured from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war.
Israel has annexed the area into its capital, but most other
countries, including the United States, do not recognize the action.

   Spring seemed more like winter Wednesday in the East and the
Midwest, as the mercury dipped below freezing, breaking
low-temperature records in five cities and tying them in four.
   Scattered snow showers fell over central New England.
   Showers and occasional thunderstorms were scattered from central
Arkansas to Oklahoma, the Texas Panhandle, the northwest third of
Texas, southern and western New Mexico, southern Colorado, Arizona
and southern Nevada. Small hail fell near Monte Vista, Colo., and
at Truth or Consequences, N.M.
   A cold front accompanied by northerly winds made temperatures
plunge in much of the eastern half of the nation overnight before
moving into the Gulf of Mexico.
   It was 22 degrees in Flint, Mich., where the old mark of 23 had
stood since 1953, and 31 degrees in Atlantic City, N.J. (32
degrees, 1983). Other records were Fort Wayne, Ind. (23 degrees, 27
in 1926 and 1953), Mansfield, Ohio (23, 26 in 1983) and South Bend,
Ind. (24, 25 in 1983).
   Records were tied in Binghamton, N.Y. (28 degrees, 1962),
Evansville, Ind. (31, 1983), Moline, Ill. (23, 1983) and Rockford,
Ill. (22, 1983).
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 32
degrees at Limestone, Maine, to 91 degrees at Fort Meyers, Fla.
   The low temperature for the Lower 48 states was 16 degrees in
Pellston, Mich.

<HEAD>Former Aquino Aide Says He Gave Her `Package of Diamonds'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former official in Philippine President
Corazon Aquino's government testified Wednesday that he gave her a
package of diamonds found in the official residence of her deposed
predecessor, Ferdinand E. Marcos.
   The disclosure came as Imelda Marcos' attorney questioned
Potenciano Roque, a U.S. government witness called to describe the
discovery of financial records at the Marcos residence in Manila
after she and her husband fled the country in February 1986.
   Mrs. Marcos is on trial in U.S. District Court on charges of
using embezzled money to buy New York properties and finance a
lavish lifestyle.
   Roque was an aide to Joker Arroyo, a Manila civil rights lawyer
and Mrs. Aquino's former personal secretary, from 1986 until last
year.
   The diamonds suddenly came up after a morning of testimony about
documents prosecutors say will help show that the Marcoses diverted
money to Swiss bank accounts and other personal uses.
   ``Did you ever give Mrs. Aquino a package of diamonds?'' Mrs.
Marcos' attorney, Gerald Spence, asked Roque.
   After a pause, Roque replied, ``Yes.''
   ``How many diamonds?'' asked Spence.
   ``Six to ten.''
   ``Did you take a receipt for them?'' the attorney said.
   ``No,'' Roque said.
   Roque didn't tell the jury where he found the diamonds, but
Spence said in a conference away from the jury that the witness
discovered the packet among documents at Malacanang Palace. Spence
was concerned that if he raised that matter in front of jurors, it
could open the door for prosecutors to introduce evidence about
other jewels.
   Under questioning by Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles LaBella,
Roque testified that he had given ``eight to ten'' diamonds in a
small plastic packet to Mrs. Aquino in her office and that she had
instructed her daughter, Corazon Cruz, who is also her personal
secretary, to call the Central Bank.
   Roque gave no other details about the incident.
   However, documents newly admitted into evidence refer to jewelry
purchased by Mrs. Marcos in New York.
   Spence said Tuesday that he believed a government witness then
on the stand would have testified, had she been asked by
prosecutors, that jewelry had been taken from the palace after the
Marcoses left.
   ``And I think we can show that jewelry has since been identified
and seen ... on both Mrs. Aquino and relatives,'' he said.
   The witness, Angelita Reyes, had told how she helped gather
documents at the palace and later turned them over to the
President's Commission on Good Government, which Aquino created to
try to recover money allegedly stolen by the Marcoses.
   Judge John F. Keenan said that since U.S. prosecutors had
indicated they didn't plan to introduce other evidence concerning
jewelry, he saw no reason to hold Reyes for further testimony.
   Mrs. Aquino's government is trying to recover millions of
dollars the Marcoses allegedly stole from their country's treasury
during 20 years in power.

   Chinese dissident leader Chai Ling said Wednesday
that resistance to China's Communist rulers is growing in her
homeland, and she predicted it will lead to the fall of the
hard-line leadership.
   Appearing at her first news conference since surfacing in Paris
two weeks ago, Chai held a placard with messages written to China's
leaders by opponents.
   ``Not even his own relatives will help him,'' said the message
to Prime Minister Li Peng.
   Chai was a leader of last spring's pro-democracy movement in
China, which was crushed by a military crackdown launched the night
of June 3. After the crackdown, she spent 10 months on the run in
China. Chai and her husband, Feng Congde, reached France this month.
   An underground movement against the Beijing government is
gaining strength in China, Chai told reporters.
   ``Even before we left Tiananmen Square, we thought there might
be a period of terror,'' she said. ``Some groups had already formed
before the massacre. We have been helped not by one group but by
several groups that are everywhere and growing stronger.''
   She gave no details of how she escaped China but said those who
helped her included soldiers and Communist Party members.
   Animated and engaging, the diminutive Chai waved to the crowded
press gallery and smiled as the news conference began.
   A badge of the Goddess of Democracy, the statue raised by the
demonstrators in Beijing last year, was pinned to her red sweater.
   During 10 months on the run, ``I noticed that the feelings we
felt in Beijing have spread throughout the country,'' Chai said.
   ``Resistance has taken many forms _ passive forms like silence,
but more active forms, also. People were very active in helping us
escape.''
   Chai helped organize the protest campaign, which was suppressed
when soldiers shot their way into central Beijing and drove student
protesters from the city's Tiananmen Square. Hundreds of people
were killed.
   She and Feng, who have applied for political asylum in France,
were on a wanted list of 21 student leaders sought by the Chinese
Communist authorities.
   Chai recalled that in 1982, she was chosen by the Young
Communists League as one of 200 model students.
   ``How did it come about that I have been listed as No. 4 of the
21 most wanted criminals?'' she said. ``I haven't stolen, I haven't
killed, I obviously haven't raped anybody. How did I become a
criminal?''
   ``The old men running the government did not take into account
the changes of the last 10 years,'' she said. ``Our generation
represents conscience and courage. When they (the government) sent
the tanks after us, they never would have thought that in front of
them there were people so fearless.''
   Her eyes grew moist as she described her taste of freedom in
Paris.
   ``I have felt freedom before, during those few days in the
square. During my escape I lost it, but we found it again,'' she
said. ``I think about my friends... We would want them to be here.''
   The emergence of Chai and Feng has given a boost to the
Federation for Democracy in China, a Paris-based dissident group.
   On Tuesday, the federation and the news magazine Actuel
announced plans for rock concerts in Paris, New York, Hong Kong,
Taipei, Prague and Sao Paulo on June 3 to commemorate the Chinese
military crackdown.
   The front and the magazine are also among the sponsors of ``A
Boat for China,'' which is sending a radio ship to the Far East to
transmit pro-democracy broadcasts to China.
   Chai was among the three most prominent student leaders of last
year's demonstrations. One leader, Wu'er Kaixi, fled to France
shortly after the crackdown. The other, Wang Dan, was captured in
Beijing.

   The United States will let Americans travel to Libya
to help wipe out a deadly parasite that threatens Africa's
livestock and wildlife, U.N. officials said Wednesday.
   In January, President Bush renewed sanctions against Libya,
including a ban on American travel. The measures date back to
former President Ronald Reagan, who accused Libya's leader, Col.
Moammar Gadhafi, of sponsoring terrorism.
   Earlier this year, U.S. officials denied requests by the United
Nations Food and Agriculture Organization for permission to send
American experts to Libya and help rid the North African country of
the screwworm fly.
   However, in March, Bush allowed U.S. officials to sell Libya
sterile screwworms in an attempt to wipe out the parasite.
   Henryk Jasiorowski, FAO assistant director general, said the
United States also has agreed to allow U.S. technicians employed by
international organizations to travel to Libya but only on
international passports.
   The fly settles in wounds or tick bites and in a few days can
kill its animal hosts by eating away at tissues. Humans with flesh
wounds can also invite infestation. It was first sighted in
northern Africa in July 1988.
   Another FAO official, Bjorn Sigurbjornsson, said an American
entomologist employed by the FAO and the International Atomic
Energy Agency is working in Libya this month.
   ``This is very important because the know-how is American,''
Jasiorowski said at a news briefing about the pest.
   The United States became an expert on the pest after a
devastating infestation of livestock in the American Southwest.
Entomologists developed a patented way of irradiating the flies to
make them sterile, and the parasite was wiped out in the United
States by 1982.
   Under the strategy, tens of millions of flies are sterilized at
a facility in Mexico, then released from airplanes above an
infested area. Matings yield no offspring and the insect dies out.
   International experts have devised an $85 million, two-year plan
that calls for the release of treated flies in Libya, starting in
1991. A trial program is to begin this summer.
   Confirmed sightings of the pest have been limited to a swath
across northern Libya, but experts say the infestation could
spread. Particularly vulnerable, they say, are Libya's neighbors,
Tunisia and Egypt.
   In Egypt the fly could move quickly down the Nile River Valley
into Central Africa, threatening livestock as well as exotic
wildlife in central Africa, the experts said. Southern Europe is
also considered at risk.
   Sigurbjornsson said he thought Egypt and Tunisia helped persuade
the United States to allow Americans into Libya. U.S. officials
have traveled to both Tunisia and Egypt to aid inspection there, he
said.
   After talks earlier this year, Washington was persuaded also to
allow the American technology to be used in Libya against the
screwworm fly. U.S. officials only agreed after receiving
assurances no resources would be given directly to the Libyan
government.
   Experts say Libyan inspection has so far helped prevent the pest
from spreading beyond its present area. Two relatively miled
winters have also helped contain the fly.
   Although FAO officials praised U.S. collaboration in the effort,
sources have said the timetable for full-scale eradication could
have been much sooner if it weren't for obstacles posed by the U.S.
sanctions.
   The fly's appearance in Libya was its debut outside the Western
hemisphere. It was believed to have entered Libya on an infected
animal, probably from Latin America.

<HEAD>Britain Says Tubes Seizure Set Back Iraqi Big Gun Project</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with statement from British owners

   Britain said Wednesday it is convinced that Iraq
was trying to build a giant gun but that customs officers
frustrated the project by seizing eight steel tubes last week.
   ``Let me make it absolutely clear that the gun itself cannot be
in operation without all its parts, and it is a great success on
the behalf of this country to have been able to prevent that
happening,'' Trade and Industry Secretary Nicholas Ridley told the
House of Commons.
   Weapons experts have said a gun on the scale of the seized parts
_ 131 feet long with a bore of 39 inches _ would have the potential
to lob nuclear or chemical warheads hundreds of miles, or even
boost rockets into orbit.
   The Iraqi government and the manufacturer, Sheffield
Forgemasters, have insisted the tubes were designed for a
petrochemical plant.
   The Iraqi Embassy in London and Forgemasters said they had no
comment on the government's statement Wednesday.
   Ridley said the government believed that Iraq's gun project
followed the designs of Gerald Bull, a Canadian-born U.S.
ballistics expert who was murdered in Brussels on March 22.
   The Financial Times reported Wednesday that the British and
Belgian governments have evidence that a Belgian defense company,
PRB, was contracted by Iraq to help produce a booster-assisted
shell for the same type of gun. PRB is owned by the British
munitions company Astra Holdings.
   Astra Holdings issued a statement Wednesday night saying that
after it acquired PRB last Sept. 11 it discovered a contract ``for
unusual types of gun propellant for very large guns.''
   ``Although all normal export documentation was in place and
appeared correct, Astra immediately reported the matter to Her
Majesty's government. The contract is no longer in force,'' the
statement said.
   Astra Holdings did not say whether the propellant had been
shipped to Iraq.
   Ridley confirmed that his own department had cleared the
production of the tubes two years ago, but said his agency had no
knowledge the goods were designed to form part of a gun ``until a
few days ago.''
   ``The government is entirely satisfied that these tubes form
part of a gun, and that the Customs action was correct,'' he said.
   Ridley's statement was the first Cabinet-level statement that
the tubing had military potential.
   During her visit to Bermuda to meet with President Bush last
weekend, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said more information was
needed to determine the purpose of the tubes.
   Gordon Brown, of the opposition Labor Party, contended the
government had been ``deceived and duped on a grand scale.''
   ``This government allowed through an order which could have made
it possible for Iraq to operate a weapon whose use could affect
regional and even world stability,'' Brown said.
   The Customs and Excise Office seized the tubes on the docks at
Middlesbrough last Thursday after a Ministry of Defense expert
concluded they could be used as a gun barrel.
   Sheffield Forgemasters said it had already shipped 44 sections
of tubing to Iraq.
   But Ridley said Wednesday, ``I understand that it will not be
possible to build a complete full-size gun from parts that have
been supplied'' from Britain.
   Ridley said his department was contacted in 1988 by Sheffield
Forgemasters, asking whether licenses were required ``for export of
tubes to Iraq for use in the polymerization of polyethylene.''
   The Department was also contacted by Walter Somers Ltd. of
Birmingham about a separate order of metal tubes from Bull's
Belgian company, Space Research Corp.
   Ridley said the export licenses wouldn't have been granted if
his department had known at the time that the tubes were designed
for use in a giant gun.
   Britain banned arms shipments to Iran and Iraq when the two
countries were at war, and the ban remains in effect.
   Western fears abut Iraqi arms programs have intensified in
recent weeks. On March 28, British customs officials seized
U.S.-made parts for atomic bomb triggers that were bound for Iraq.
   Iraq has denied seeking a nuclear capability, but has confirmed
its arsenal includes chemical weapons.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein recently threatened to use
missiles armed with chemical weapons against Israel if Israeli
forces attacked his country.

   Sudan's military government will put
non-profitable public sector enterprises on sale to private buyers,
a decree issued Wednesday said.
   It did not identify the enterprises but said they include ``all
losing, marginal and non-vital economic units in the country.'' It
said Arab and foreign investors would be allowed to buy such
enterprises that ``failed to boost the public treasury resources.''
   The decree by Col. Salah Mohamed Karrar, head of the economics
committee of the ruling military junta, said the step was taken to
``stop the deterioration of the economy.''
   On May 5, Sudan has a round of talks scheduled with the
International Monetary Fund. But the decree said the decision to
sell public sector units comes within the government economic
reform program and denied it was taken under pressure from the IMF.
   Sudan has a foreign debt of $13 billion.
   The decree said the units proposed for sale have assets of
nearly $416.7 million and owe Sudan's Central Bank $83.3 million.
   Karrar has said the IMF proposed raising the official exchange
rate for Sudan's currency from 4.5 pounds to the dollar to 15
pounds and the free market exchange from 12 pounds to the dollar to
30 pounds.
   The IMF talks will be the fourth round since the government of
Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan el-Bashir came to power in a military coup
last June 30.

<HEAD>Two German Governments Say They Won't Spy on Each Other</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two German governments on
Wednesday pledged not to spy on each other, and said they hope to
have a completely open common border by summer.
   Interior ministers Peter-Michael Diestel of East Germany and
Wolfgang Schaeuble of West Germany conferred in Bonn on ways to
improve security cooperation and help pave the way for German unity.
   Schaeuble said he and Diestel agreed that East German
``espionage activities would not be continued under the new (East
German) government'' against West Germany.
   Schaeuble added the new East German government is ``not the
target of intelligence observation'' by West Germany.
   But he noted that both German states still belong to opposing
military alliances.
   The West German minister said the matter of future German
intelligence-gathering can be ``settled only in a comprehensive
way.'' He suggested the issue will come up in German unification
talks among the two Germanys and the four World War II allies _ the
United States, France, Britain and the Soviet Union.
   Under the ``two-plus-four'' talks formula, foreign ministers of
the six nations will meet to discuss international complexities
involved in unification.
   Schaeuble told a news conference the two Germanys hope to have a
completely free common border by summer.
   East Germany opened its borders last Nov.9. Officially,
residents of both German states still must show passports when they
cross the border now, but sometimes even that practice is waived.
   Diestel said East Germany plans to do away with that formality.

<HEAD>Doctors of Jamaican Prime Minister Find Cancerous Lump</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors who examined Prime Minister
Michael Manley in New York have determined he has a cancerous lump
on the prostate gland, his spokesman said Wednesday.
   The physicians however are optimistic about a full recovery and
the 65-year-old prime minister plans to ``resume work fully,''
spokesman Hartley Neita said.
   The condition was diagnosed from tests Manley underwent Monday
during a checkup at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Neita
said.
   Doctors found that a lump found on Manley's prostate gland
during his annual medical examination was cancerous, but ``tests
have not shown any spread beyond the lesion,'' the spokesman said.
   He said Manley would take oral medication for one month and then
have the lump surgically removed.
   Cancer of the prostate gland, which is at the base of the
urethra, commonly afflicts older men.
   His Jamaican doctors ``have indicated that the prognosis for a
full recovery is excellent,'' a government statement said.
   The medical team ``is also satisfied that the condition
diagnosed and the treatment prescribed will not affect Mr. Manley's
ability to carry out his responsibilities and duties as prime
minister of the country,'' the statement added.
   Manley was flying back to Jamaica Wednesday night in time for
Thursday's re-opening of Parliament, Neita said.
   Manley, who served as prime minister from 1972 to 1980 and was
elected to a third term in February 1989, has previously been
troubled by diverticulitis, an inflammation of the intestines.
   He has undergone surgery for the condition in 1985 and 1987.

   Tugboats on Wednesday began towing the
burned-out hulk of the Scandinavian Star ferry to Denmark, where it
will be examined to see if a fire that killed an estimated 161
people was deliberately set.
   Two tugboats towed the disabled 20-year-old ferry from the west
coast port of Lysekil to Copenhagen.
   Earlier Wednesday, a commission of government officials from
Norway, Sweden and Denmark boarded the ferry for the first time to
evaluate the ship's safety standards.
   The Nordic commission is expected to recommend new safety
standards for ferries traveling in Scandinavian waters.
   A separate marine inquiry in Copenhagen, which this week heard
testimony from 24 witnesses to the disaster, exposed a series of
safety omissions and blunders that may have contributed to the high
death toll.
   Police in Oslo, Norway, estimated 161 people died in the April 7
fire, but said the figure was not final because it was still
uncertain how many passengers boarded the ferry. The Danish-owned
vessel was on an overnight run from Oslo to Frederikshavn, Denmark.
   Police have said they suspect arson in the disaster.

<TEXT>
   Parliament refused Wednesday to allow prosecution
of two embattled anti-corruption investigators accused of attacking
Communist Party privilege in a witch-hunt.
   The Supreme Soviet's decision not to lift legislative immunity
from prosecutors Telman Gdlyan and Nikolai Ivanov quieted, at least
temporarily, a dispute that had aroused the political ire of many
Soviets.
   Tens of thousands of people rallied in Moscow and Leningrad on
Tuesday in support of the two. Demonstrators in Leningrad had urged
a strike if they lost their immunity.
   Even in the era of glasnost, when virtually any political topic
is open for debate, few political issues have aroused such intense
interest. The campaign to protect Gdlyan and Ivanov has encompassed
Soviet frustration with Communist Party privilege.
   The prosecutors and their supporters say officials have tried to
silence them to keep the investigation from stretching to Politburo
officials. Opponents say the two have succumbed to the illegal
means that were a trademark of the authorities they are pursuing.
   Gdlyan and Ivanov, who did not attend the legislative session,
were warned ``if they continue activity leading to the
destabilization of the situation in the country, the Supreme Soviet
will move to lift parliamentary immunity from them,'' the Tass news
agency said.
   Tass did not report the vote total, but the evening TV news
program ``Vremya'' showed a picture of the Supreme Soviet's vote
tally board, indicating the measure passed 275-84.
   The Parliament sanctioned an earlier decision to fire them from
the Soviet Prosecutor's Office, but also called for the dismissal
of unidentified officials who failed to supervise their work.
   It said the prosecutor's office, the Interior Ministry, the KGB
and the Supreme Court should hold accountable ``those senior
officials whose activities caused especially sharp public anxiety.''
   The officials were not identified, but among those subject to
criticism during the sharp two-day debate on the prosecutors'
activities was Soviet Prosecutor General Alexander Sukharev.
   Demonstrators who rallied near the Kremlin on Tuesday carried
signs reading ``Gdlyan and Ivanov are our conscience!'' and ``The
fate of Gdlyan and Ivanov is the fate of democracy. Protect them!''
   A legislative committee found no grounds to charges by the pair
that conservative Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev was linked to
the corruption they were probing, or that President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev was ``turning a blind eye to the mafia.''
   The Supreme Soviet condemned what it called ``unfounded
statements ... which discredit the Supreme Soviet, individual
people's deputies and officials.''
   Sukharev accused the two of holding 50 people illegally for
periods of up to several years. They also have been accused of
threatening detainees and their families in order to extract
statements.
   Gdlyan and Ivanov were discharged from the Communist Party on
Feb. 21. They rode their populist anti-corruption campaign to
election to the national Congress of People's Deputies last March.
   The two gained fame uncovering a trail of bribery and corruption
among top Communist Party officials in the Central Asian republic
Uzbekistan that led to the conviction of former President Leonid I.
Brezhnev's son-in-law. In 1988 Yuri D. Churbanov was sentenced to
12 years in a labor camp.

   Nations will have to impose stronger controls on
ozone-destroying chemicals if the atmosphere is to be made safe for
ozone again within the next century, a new study suggests.
   Even if all emissions were stopped in the year 2000, levels of
ozone-depleting chlorine in the atmosphere would not drop to
relatively benign levels until about the year 2070, the study says.
   The work is presented in Thursday's issue of the British journal
Nature by Michael Prather and Robert Watson of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   Scientists are concerned about destruction of ozone at high
altitudes because that ozone layer shields Earth from solar rays
that can cause skin cancer.
   The United States and other nations have signed a 1987
agreement, called the Montreal Protocol, in which they pledged to
cut production of some ozone-destroying chemicals in half by the
end of this decade.
   Since then, representatives of 81 countries have called for an
end to production and use of ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbons
by the year 2000.
   The new study considered not only the compounds covered by the
Montreal Protocol but also other ozone-depleting compounds,
including carbon tetrachloride and methyl chloroform. It estimated
how long it would take, under various degrees of regulation of the
compounds, to lower the atmospheric concentration of chlorine from
more than 3 parts per billion today to 2 parts per billion.
   The lower figure was the concentration in the late 1970s when
scientists first noticed the ``ozone hole,'' an area over
Antarctica in which a substantial amount of ozone disappears every
year.
   The study found that if emissions were cut to half of their 1985
levels at the end of the year 2000, atmospheric chlorine
concentrations would dip only slightly from a starting level of
just under 5 parts per billion, and then rise above 5.3 parts per
billion by the year 2100.
   If emissions were eliminated in the year 2000, chlorine
concentrations would reach the 2 parts per billion target in the
year 2073, researchers said. But the target might be difficult or
impossible to reach by the year 2100 if chlorine-bearing
substitutes for chlorofluorocarbons were used indefinitely,
researchers said.
   Similarly, a 90 percent reduction in emissions in the year 2000
would delay reaching the target until 2175, researchers said.
   Guy Brasseur, director of the atmospheric chemistry division at
the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo.,
called the study important.
   It shows, he says, that ``at the present time we haven't solved
the problem.''

<HEAD>Kennedy Calls for Civil Rights Bill Approval _ Over Veto If Need
Be</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy on Wednesday called for
approval of a major civil rights bill even if it means overriding a
presidential veto and blamed the administration for being more
willing to compromise than to lead.
   ``Often, as in the current civil rights debate, the
administration waits on the sidelines until its position becomes
untenable in Congress,'' the Massachusetts Democrat said. ``Then it
rushes onto the playing field with a half-hearted alternative.''
   He was scornful of a Bush administration version of the civil
rights bill. ``On a surprisingly large number of significant
issues, this administration has shown a willingness to compromise
but a reluctance to lead,'' Kennedy said.
   ``What we expect and need instead is a whole-hearted commitment
to civil rights,'' Kennedy said in remarks prepared for delivery to
a dinner in honor of the 50th anniversary of the NAACP Legal
Defense and Educational Fund Inc.
   Kennedy is chief among 40 Senate co-sponsors of a bill that
would reverse six Supreme Court rulings last year that civil rights
forces call a severe setback. Provisions range from banning racial
harrassment in the workplace to requiring employers to provide
proof if they claim lopsided hiring practices are a business
necessity.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said recently the measure would
usher in hiring quotas and added that he and other top
administration officials would urge a veto if the bill reached
President Bush's desk.
   Kennedy said that ``Martin Luther King eloquently taught us
acceptance of injustice is unacceptable ... now is always that time
for civil rights.''
   ``And if that means overriding President Bush's veto of the
Civil Rights ACt of 1990, I say, `so be it.' America is not America
if we pay lip service to liberty and close our eyes to clear
injustice.''
   The administration is pushing for an alternative bill that would
overturn two of the six Supreme Court decisions. Kennedy scoffed at
that approach.

   The Soviet Union shut off oil supplies to
Lithuania's only refinery Wednesday as Moscow began to impose
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's threatened economic embargo on the breakaway
Baltic republic, Lithuanian officials said.
   Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis said the move
represented ``economic coercion and economic warfare against a
neighboring country.''
   ``Truly, this is recognition of the independence of Lithuania,''
he said. ``It is hard to imagine why the people of Lithuania ...
are being punished. What was their crime?''
   Lithuanian Premier Kazimiera Prunskiene went to Olso, Norway, on
a three-day mission seeking alternative oil supplies.
   The action was one of the toughest in Soviet President
Gorbachev's effort to make Lithuania rethink its March 11
declaration of independence. Lithuania _ forcibly annexed by the
Soviet Union in 1940 _ is entirely dependent on Moscow for its oil
and gas, which it receives at subsidized prices.
   Lithuanian officials estimated this week that the republic of
3.8 million people has enough oil to last six weeks to three months.
   In Washington, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said action
by Moscow against Lithuania could doom commercial relations between
the Soviet Union and the United States.
   He said, ``It's very difficult to see some of the commercial
aspects of our relationship surviving the use of force or
coercion'' against Lithuania.
   President Bush's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said ``we are
looking into'' reports of the oil cutoff.
   He also said Bush received a private letter from Landsbergis _
``The president has not seen it yet but he will. We won't comment
on the content.''
   The oil turnoff came hours after Soviet Deputy Oil and Gas
Minister Aklim Mukhamedzyanov told the Tass news agency reports of
an energy cutoff ``are completely groundless,'' and that the
Council of Ministers issued no instructions to stop the flow.
   ``The flow of crude oil to Mazhiekiai was cut off at
approximately 9:30 p.m. (2:30 p.m. EDT),'' said Aidas Palubinskas,
a spokesman for Lithuania's Supreme Council legislature.
   Lithuanian gas officials said there was no disruption in natural
gas, and the supply of Soviet gas would continue uninterrupted at
least until morning.
   Reading an official government statement, Palubinskas said
Mazhiekiai refinery director Bronius Vainoras confirmed the single
pipeline feeding the plant from the Russian city of Polotsk had
been shut down.
   The statement said a message read earlier by telephone to
Vainoras stated: ``In accordance with the resolution of the Council
of Ministers, we are halting pumping of crude oil to your
refinery.''
   All oil stopped moving through the pipeline about an hour after
the shutdown, said Lithuanian Supreme Council spokeswoman Loretta
Stanulis. She quoted Vainoras as saying the plant would continue
operating on reserves for now.
   Landsbergis told a news conference earlier Wednesday that an
economic embargo ``would resemble an angry man beating himself.''
   He said it would have an impact on Latvia, Estonia and the
Kaliningrad region of Russia, Eduardas Potasinskas of Lithuanian TV
reported.
   Gorbachev said last Friday that unless Lithuania rescinded
several laws supporting the declaration of independence, he would
impose an embargo on key supplies.
   He called unconstitutional Lithuania's moves to curtail the
spring draft into the Soviet Army, give residents Lithuanian
identity cards and seize the property of the Communist Party on
Lithuanian territory.
   The Kremlin says Lithuanian independence can be discussed only
within the framework of the Soviet Constitution. A law passed April
4 would let republics secede if two-thirds of their residents
approve secession in a referendum, and sets a maximum waiting
period of five years.
   Gorbachev did not spell out what materials would be cut off,
saying only they would be those goods the Soviet Union sells abroad
for hard currency _ meaning oil and natural gas.
   Petroleum products are the Soviet Union's most profitable export.
   The Mazhiekiai refinery in northwestern Lithuania refines about
12 million tons of petroleum products a year, but Lithuania uses
about a quarter of the output, journalists quoted government
officials as saying.
   Sales of gasoline in Lithuania tripled this week as motorists
reacted to Gorbachev's threat with panic-buying, said Lithuanian
Energy Minister Leonas Asmantas.
   He reported Tuesday receiving unofficial information that crude
oil supplies and natural gas would be reduced Wednesday. Lithuanian
gas officials received a telegram from a regional Soviet energy
official saying supplies of natural gas would be curtailed sharply
by order of the government.
   But by late Wednesday, no change in the supply had been noted.
   Lithuania's Supreme Council has refused to rescind the laws
Gorbachev wants off the books, but offered to pass no more such
measures if the Kremlin starts negotiations by May 1.
   That effort at compromise appeared unlikely to be accepted by
the Soviet leadership.
   The Supreme Council, in anticipation of a possible embargo,
urged Lithuanian factories and consumers to ``prepare themselves
for spiritual endurance and strict economy on all consumption.'' It
announced no specific conservation measures.
   In a resolution titled ``On the Expansion of Relations between
the Republic of Lithuania and the U.S.S.R., members of the Supreme
Council reaffirmed their declaration of independence and appealed
to Gorbachev not to use violence against Lithuanians or impose the
economic sanctions he threatened.
   In a separate letter to Gorbachev, the Lithuanian legislature
expressed ``regrets on the position and methods chosen by the
U.S.S.R.''
   Legislators said they were forming a delegation led by Bronius
Kuzmickas, vice president of the Supreme Council, to travel to
Moscow for possible talks. Gorbachev has issued a series of
ultimatums since Lithuania declared independence. In most cases,
such as a demand that Lithuanians surrender private firearms, he
has not reacted when they refused to give in.
   The Kremlin also sent tanks and military vehicles through
Lithuania's capital, Vilnius, rounded up Lithuanians who deserted
from the Red Army, seized buildings and barred Western journalists
from Lithuania.
   Lithuania picked up support Wednesday from neighboring Poland,
with the Solidarity delegation to the Polish parliament adopting a
resolution expressing concern over Moscow's exerting ``growing
pressure.'' The delegation also suggested Warsaw assist in
negotiations between the republic and the Kremlin.
   Japan's cabinet secretary, Misoji Sakamoto, urged Soviets to
exercise ``prudence'' and expressed concern over Kremlin threats of
punitive actions.

   The first detector of plastic explosives to be
installed by U.S. officials in a foreign airport is to be set up at
London's Gatwick Airport in a few weeks, a spokesman for the
company that built it said Wednesday.
   The Federal Aviation Administration announced that it signed an
agreement with the British Airports Authority for the thermal
neutron analysis, or TNA, unit in the public area of the airport
for use by U.S. and other airlines.
   The FAA's decision to use the machines was prompted by the
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 in December 1988 over Lockerbie,
Scotland that killed 270 people.
   Other neutron analysis units have been installed at John F.
Kennedy airport in New York and at Miami's international airport,
but both have been put in baggage areas and handle luggage of only
one carrier.
   The FAA said baggage destined for the United States aboard U.S.
carriers will be given first priority for the London machine. The
next prioirty will be other planes bound for the United States.
   ``The machine has been ready and boxed for several weeks,'' said
Hadi Bozorgmanesh, vice president of Science Applications
International Corp. of California, the only manufacturer.
   Bozorgmanish said in a telephone interview that space for the
machine is ready at Gatwick.
   The FAA has ordered U.S. airlines to pay for and install nuetron
analysis units or similar machines at high-risk airports they use
around the world. The London machine, however, will be operated by
the airport, rather than an airline.
   FAA Administrator James B. Busey has said he has been frustrated
by difficulties with negotiations to install the devices in
airports. The agency is negotiating to put the machines in airports
in Frankfurt, West Germany, where Flight 103 originated, and
Manila, the Philippines. One is also planned for Washington's
Dulles International Airport.
   ``TNA cannot guarantee security,'' Busey said on Tuesday. ``But
it is the latest and best technology that we have and it is a
needed weapon in what is a growing arsenal in the sturggle against
terrorism.''
   The FAA said the Gatwick machine should be in operation in time
for the summer travel season.

   Lithuania's prime minister, Kazimiera
Prunskiene, came to Oslo on Wednesday seeking Norwegian oil to help
offset a Soviet oil cutoff to the independence-minded Baltic
republic.
   ``This trip is important because of the brutal economic
blockade,'' she said.
   She spoke before reports from Lithuania said Moscow cut off
crude oil supplies to Lithuania late Wednesday in an effort to
thwart its drive toward independence.
   Mrs. Prunskiene called her first visit to the West ``unofficial
and informal.'' She told an airport news conference that talks with
senior Norwegian officials ``will have a lot to do with practical
problems.''
   The three-day visit will help determine if Norway, a major oil
exporter, would help break the blockade, she said.
   Prime Minister Jan P. Syse of Norway soft-pedaled the meeting.
He said in a television interview that a non-governmental body made
the invitation prior to increased tensions between Lithuania and
Moscow. He did not expect Moscow to see the meeting as ``meddling
in the internal affairs of the Soviet Union.''
   He said NATO-member Norway has not promised Lithuania oil
supplies. ``The state does not sell oil, that is up to the oil
companies,'' he said.
   ``It is very curious that yesterday we heard promises of
supplies,'' Mrs. Prunskiene said at the airport, without
elaborating.
   Norway's state oil company Statoil has said it was willing to
sell Lithuania crude oil supplies at market prices paid in dollars.
A spokesman said Statoil had not been approached.
   Asked if Lithuania had enough Western currency to pay for oil,
Mrs. Prunskiene replied, ``We don't expect oil companies to give us
anything for free. Naturally we are prepared to pay. Very much
depends on what kinds of contacts and contracts are possible.''
   Mrs. Prunskiene and Foreign Minister Algirdas Saudargas were
invited by Norway's three governing coalition parties, through a
joint organization called ``Give Democracy in the East a Chance.''
   The organization is non-governmental, but was created by
Norway's Conservative-led coalition to nurture non-socialist
political parties in the East bloc.
   The Lithuanians will meet Syse, Foreign Minister Kjell Magne
Bondevik and members of parliament. They will also visit the west
coast city of Stavanger, center of Norway's 1.5
million-barrel-a-day offshore oil production, according to a news
release.

   Tonya Brooks is often afraid to look out her
window.
   ``Bullets don't have no names on them,'' said the 21-year-old
mother of three who lives in the 50-year-old Logan Fontenelle
public housing project, which has been dubbed ``Vietnam'' because
of the drugs, gangs and violence.
   Ms. Brooks would like to live in a quiet, safe neighborhood. But
a plan to demolish the 388-unit housing project and relocate its
residents has stirred controversy in this largely middle-class city
of 350,000 along the Missouri River.
   The Omaha Housing Authority wants to use a $9 million U.S.
Housing and Urban Development grant to scatter 194 of the families
at Logan Fontenelle around the city, a plan rejected 4-3 by the
City Council in December. Some opponents said it was too costly;
others wanted more say in where the new housing units would be
located.
   The housing authority then revised the plan so that it didn't
need city council approval for the scattered site housing. But the
council still must approve the razing of the Logan Fontenelle, a
grim, red-brick project on Omaha's predominantly black north side.
   Mayor P.J. Morgan and Omaha Housing Authority Executive Director
Robert Armstrong are determined to demolish Logan Fontenelle, which
is overrun by Los Angeles-based gangs, the Bloods and the Crips,
who sell cocaine and crack. Drive-by shootings are commonplace.
   No further city council debates are scheduled on the issue,
however, as Morgan and Armstrong try to draft a compromise measure
that would gain majority council support.
   But the mayor said Wednesday he would withdraw his support for
the plan if the Logan Fontenelle units are only boarded up and left
standing. ``That brings a greater blight to that part of the
community,'' Morgan said.
   To complicate matters, four black residents of Logan Fontenelle
have filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court accusing the housing
authority, HUD and city officials of racial segregation in housing
policies.
   Armstrong said he hopes the lawsuit might be dropped if the
scattered site plan gets the expected approval from HUD.
   Mary Clarkson, an attorney for the four residents, said
Wednesday that in addition to Logan Fontenelle the lawsuit involves
claims about Section 8 low-income housing and other housing
projects. She said any attempt or plan that would desegegrate Logan
Fontenelle is relevant to the case.
   ``It's premature at this time to know whether this plan ...
would have that effect because there's little or no information
about where these scattered sites would be,'' she said.
   Scattered low-income housing isn't new to Omaha, which has put
195 units around the city since 1980. But it became an issue with
Logan Fontenelle because of the project's tough reputation and the
large number of families who would need relocating at once.
   HUD doesn't push for scattered-site housing, but it's an option
for local housing authorities, said HUD's director of public
housing, Thomas Sherman.
   Sherman said the program often faces community opposition.
   ``It's just a feeling, not based upon fact, if you put
low-income people in their neighborhoods, property values will
deteriorate. The other reason is purely racial. There are still
communities around this country that don't want to desegrate or
integrate,'' he said from Washington.
   He said HUD encourages low-income people to find their own
housing and use a federal voucher system, called Section 8
certificates, to help pay the rent.
   Under the housing authority plan, the authority would buy 134
homes and duplexes over a four-year period, giving the tenants an
option to buy. Sixty additional units would be leased through
Section 8 certificates. As the plan stands now, the 194 units
emptied by those actions would be boarded up until the council
approves their demolition.
   The authority's plan has a long-term goal of demolishing the
remaining 194 units in Logan Fontenelle by the year 2000, but how
the tenants would be relocated has not been determined.
   Some opponents of scattered-site housing in Omaha have said it
gives low-income people housing they don't deserve and costs too
much.
   ``How far do we go in providing homes for people who are
unemployed?'' City Councilman Steve Tomasek asked. ``Are we
supposed to provide a $70,000 home in a neighborhood that is
otherwise gainfully employed?''
   Armstrong said people in the scattered-site program would have
to hold jobs and pay 30 percent of their income for rent. An
average of $67,000 in federal money would be available to purchase
each home.
   ``I guess I hate to see taxpayers providing money for housing
that is of greater value than the taxpayers','' said one northwest
Omaha resident, Walt Nabity.
   Others support the housing authority's plan.
   ``I think it'd give people a better chance ... to get them out
of that ghetto,'' homeowner Mary Barnhart said. ``They deserve that
chance.''

<HEAD>Government Says Iran-Contra Figure in Baltimore Case Tried to Hide
Money</HEAD>

   Former CIA agent Thomas Clines attempted to
hide from the government hundreds of thousands of dollars in
profits he made from supplying arms to the Contras, according to
court papers filed by Iran-Contra prosecutors.
   Clines was indicted Feb. 22 and he is seeking to have the tax
charges against him thrown out on grounds that the office of
independent counsel Lawrence Walsh lacks jurisdiction in the case.
The government's reply was made available Wednesday.
   Facing a May 14 trial in U.S. District Court in Baltimore,
Clines is accused of underreporting his income to the Internal
Revenue Service and failing to report foreign financial accounts to
the Treasury Department.
   Clines' lawyer says the tax case falls outside the scope of the
Iran-Contra prosecutors' jurisdiction.
   ``Mr. Clines has not been charged with committing any crime by
virtue of his particiption in the purchase, sale or transfer of
arms ... nor has he been charged with any crime relating to ...
support to the Contras,'' said his lawyer, Paula Junghans.
   Prosecutors opposed Clines' motion to dismiss the indictment,
saying that ``crimes involving the attempt to hide arms sale
profits'' are within Walsh's authority to investigate, according to
their counter-motion.
   The government expects evidence at Clines' trial to show that in
1985, $423,000 in profits were distributed to him as a result of
his Iran-Contra activities, according to papers filed Tuesday by
Iran-Contra prosecutors in Baltimore and released Wednesday in
Washington. In 1986, said the prosecutors, Clines' profits from
Iran-Contra activities amounted to some $459,000.
   Clines reported gross receipts of $265,000 and $402,513 for 1985
and 1986 respectively, according to his tax returns which were
filed in the case.
   Clines assisted the Contra resupply network overseen by Oliver
North. He helped locate a European arms dealer as a source of
weapons, helped arrange for shipping and lined up crews to
transport the supplies to the rebels.
   He worked with businessman Richard Secord, a retired Air Force
major general whom North enlisted to run arms to the Contras.
   Clines also moved that the court suppress evidence, arguing that
documents on foreign accounts which prosecutors obtained under a
U.S.-Swiss treaty cannot be used in the case.
   Prosecutors say that ``the only Swiss records to be used as
evidence in this case'' will be those produced by Secord's business
partner Albert Hakim, who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor in the
scandal and is cooperating with the government.

<HEAD>Legislators Begin Sit-in to Protest New Censorship Measures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eighteen opposition legislators began a
48-hour sit-in Wednesday to protest the government's implementation
of censorship rules without consulting Parliament.
   The legislators, all independents except for one member of the
main opposition Social Democrat Populist Party, said they would not
leave Parliament's assembly hall for two days.
   The government last Saturday adopted a decree sharply
restricting news coverage in the southeastern Kurdish areas, and
increasing the powers of the regional governor in charge of areas
where Kurdish guerrillas have been fighting for an independent
homeland.
   Almost 2,500 civilians, guerrillas and security forces have been
killed in clashes in the southeast since 1984.
   Ethnic Kurds make up about one-fifth of Turkey's population of
55 million.
   The decree banned the Turkish press from carrying stories or
analyses that might harm security operations. It ruled that
publications carrying reports threatening law and order would be
banned throughout the country or their printing plants closed.
   Two leftist weeklies, 2000'e Dogru and Sokak, which gave wide
coverage to the Kurdish insurgency in the past, failed to appear at
newstands this week as printers canceled their contracts to protest
the new rules.
   The decree also empowered the regional governor to ban strikes
that threaten law and order and expel from the area residents
threating public order.
   Fehmi Isiklar, a spokesman for the protesting deputies, demanded
the decree be brought before Parliament as soon as possible.
   The constitution requires the government to submit such decrees
to Parliament for approval, but does not specify the timing.
Opposition parties have been demanding decrees go into force after
and not before Parliament approves them.

<HEAD>Yugoslavia Lifts State of Emergency in Kosovo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yugoslav authorities lifted a
yearlong state of emergency Wednesday in the ethnically troubled
southern province of Kosovo, Belgrade television reported.
   It said the federal collective presidency acted at the request
of Serbia following a Serbian police takeover in the region.
Serbia, the largest of Yugoslavia's six republics, administers
Kosovo.
   Serbia's Communist authorities announced last month they were
abolishing existing police autonomy in Kosovo because local
security forces failed to act during unrest there by ethnic
Albanians demanding self-government.
   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population. They
have staged numerous protests and demonstrations to back up their
demands since the Yugoslav government introduced, at Serbian
request, a state of emergency in the province in March 1989.
   The presidency said in a statement that security ``has been
stabilized to a certain degree in Kosovo, making it possible to
lift the state of emergency in the province.'' It said it was
convinced that easing security measures ``will improve the overall
situation in Kosovo and the country as a whole.''
   About 60 ethnic Albanian protesters were killed in Kosovo and
hundreds more imprisoned after federal authorities deployed Serbian
police units and army contingents to curb the unrest.
   Serbian officials claim the measures were needed to prevent what
they describe as harassment of Kosovo's 200,000 Slavs by
``terrorists and separatists'' of Albanian origin. They say ethnic
Albanians are trying to secede from Yugoslavia to join neighboring
Albania.
   Human rights groups from Yugoslavia's liberal northern republics
of Slovenia and Croatia, international rights monitors and several
Western governmental organizations denounced the crackdown in
Kosovo.

   Scientists say they have identified the sex of
3-day-old embryos in the test tube, and that two women implanted
with tested embryos are expected to delthis summer.
   Further research might provide a way to screen out embryos that
would develop serious genetic diseases, removing the prospect of
abortions in those cases, researchers said.
   The study was aimed at producing female babies in cases whiver twin
girls ere a
male could inherit a serious genetic disease, said researcher Alan
Handyside.
   While the technique also would allow choosing the sex of a child
without any medical reason, Handyside said he would consider that
unethical.
   The new work is reported in Thursday's issue of the British
journal Nature by Handyside and colleagues at the Royal
Postgraduate Medical School at Hammersmith Hospital in London.
   Laboratory techniques have been used before to determine a
baby's sex. In 1986, a New Orleans fertility institute announced
the birth of a boy whose sex had been selected during ``in vitro''
fertilization, which is done in the laboratory. That case involved
selecting sperm to produce a boy.
   But sperm ich only a
risk rather than a certainty can be predicted, diseases that appear
only after decades of normal life, and childhood diseases with
which people can live into early adulthood, she said.
   ``Some might consider it to be socially very undesirable for a
woman to take a 50 percent chance of having a child who is going to
be obese ... since those children are likely to get into more
medical problems and cost the society,'' she said.

<HEAD>Fire Damages Winston Churchill's Birthplace</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLENHEIM, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blenheim Palace, the Duke of
Marlborough's stately home and birthplace of Winston Churchill, was
damaged Wednesday by fire, but there were no reported injuries.
   There was no serious structural damage to the house, 60 miles
northwest of London, palace administrator Paul Duffie said.
   Duffie said he was the first to spot the flames on the roof of
the southwest tower, where roofers had been working earlier in the
day.
   Before firefighters arrived, palace staff used fire
extinguishers and covered the house's bookcases with protective
sheeting, he said.
   ``The fire brigade did not use one more drop of water than was
necessary so damage was kept to a minimum,'' Duffie said. ``If
thousands of gallons had been poured onto the flames, the results
could have been disastrous.''
   But the wooden roof, flooring and some metallic work of the
house would have to be replaced, fire brigade officials said.
   Duffie said a conservation expert was examining the collection
of 10,000 books at Blenheim Palace, which is open to the public.
   An investigation was launched into the cause of the fire, which
was controlled within an hour.
   The Duke of Marlborough is from one of most famous British
aristocratic families. The current duke is the 11th duke. Lord
Randolph Spencer-Churchill, father of wartime Prime Minister
Winston Churchill, was the third son of the 7th Duke of Marlborough.
   Blenheim Palace was designed by Sir John Vanbrugh and finished
in 1722.
   Winston Churchill was born at Blenheim Palace in 1874 and is
buried in the churchyard at the edge of the house's vast park.
   The Duke of Marlborough was not home at the time of the fire.

<HEAD>February Shows Smallest Trade Deficit in Six Years</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs grafs 2-3 to include administration predictions on
trade; INSERTS grafs 16-17: ``The administration's,'' with more on
trade outlook</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States in February recorded its
smallest trade deficit in more than six years, a $6.49 billion
imbalance that reflected a sharp drop in oil imports, the
government reported Wednesday.
   The Bush administration hailed the dramatic narrowing of the
deficit but later in the day released a new forecast which
pessimistically predicted that further trade improvements this year
were likely to be ``at best very modest.''
   The administration's trade forecast, required by Congress, said
that any further narrowing of the trade deficit this year is likely
to be much smaller than in the past two years and that a ``modest
widening'' of the deficit could not be ruled out.
   The Commerce Department said February's trade gap was down 30
percent from a $9.32 billion January deficit. It was the best trade
showing since December 1983, when the deficit was $5.68 billion.
   Imports fell by 7.6 percent, to $38.12 billion, while U.S.
exports totaled $31.63 billion, a modest 1 percent decline from an
all-time high for exports set in January.
   Michael Boskin, President Bush's chief economic adviser, called
the trade figure ``very good news indeed'' while cautioning that
``we can't tell yet the extent to which it is a temporary or
permanent phenomenon.''
   Some private economists remained pessimistic, contending that
February's good showing came primarily from a huge 20 percent drop
in oil imports that's not likely to be sustained.
   With U.S. domestic oil production at 25-year lows, many
economists look for America's dependence on foreign oil to continue
rising, thus holding back improvements in the trade deficit.
   Last year's trade deficit totaled $109 billion and many analysts
are looking for the figure to deteriorate this year, reflecting a
higher oil bill and weaker export growth because of the strength of
the U.S. dollar.
   A stronger dollar makes U.S. goods less competitive in overseas
markets.
   ``It's nice to have a low number for February, but it would
certainly be a mistake to conclude that our competitiveness
problems have disappeared and everything is now terrific for us on
international markets,'' said Lawrence Chimerine, senior economic
adviser at the WEFA Group, an economic consulting company in Bala
Cynwyd, Pa.
   But Bruce Steinberg, senior economist at Merrill Lynch, said he
believed the trade deficit would shrink further this year, falling
below $100 billion for the first time since 1983.
   He said America's trade fortunes were being helped by strong
demand in Western Europe, the primary market for U.S. exports.
   While the trade balance with Japan worsened in February, rising
to $3.12 billion, the United States ran a $1 billion trade surplus
with Western Europe.
   ``We have gone from running big trade deficits with Western
Europe to being in rough balance and everything is in place to
start running big surpluses,'' Steinberg said.
   The administration's trade outlook held out some hope that the
dramatic changes occurring in Eastern Europe would narrow trade
differences, at least in Europe.
   The report said that the unification of West and East Germany
should act to lower West Germany's huge trade surplus because the
united country will need to import more from abroad to meet
increased demand.
   The deficit with Japan, which accounted for half of February's
total imbalance, is coming as the Bush administration applies heavy
pressure on the government of Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu to open
Japanese markets to more American products.
   Regardless of their view about future trade prospects,
economists agreed that February's improvement would significantly
boost overall economic growth for the first three months of the
year.
   Steinberg predicted that the overall economy, as measured by the
gross national product, expanded at an annual rate of between 2.5
percent to 3 percent, with more than 1 percentage point of that
gain coming from a smaller trade deficit.
   In the final three months of 1989, the GNP grew at a sluggish
1.1 percent rate.
   Oil imports, which surged by 44 percent in January, fell in
February by 20 percent, to $4.71 billion, reflecting a drop in the
price per barrel and the number of barrels imported.
   The big swing in both months was weather related, with cold
December temperatures pushing up demand and an unusually warm
January cutting back on oil imports in February.
   In addition to the drop in oil shipments, imports of consumer
appliances and other durable goods fell by 7.5 percent while
imports of clothing and other consumer non-durable goods dropped by
10 percent, primarily reflecting sluggish U.S. demand, analysts
said.
   However, imports of foreign cars were up by 25 percent, to $2.56
billion in February.
   On the export side, there were small declines in a variety of
areas but these were offset by a doubling in sales of aircraft,
which climbed to $2.27 billion, reflecting a spurt in shipments by
the Seattle-based Boeing Co., which was idled by a strike late last
year.

   Frederic Rossif, a Yugoslav-born documentary
filmmaker whose subjects included Pablo Picasso, African wildlife
and Nazi Germany, died of a heart attack Wednesday, his production
company said. He was 68.
   He won France's coveted Jean Vigo award in 1963 for ``To Die in
Madrid,'' about the Spanish Civil War, and was considered one of
Europe's foremost documentary filmmakers.
   Rossif was born Feb. 16, 1922, in Montenegro, Yugoslavia, and
went to college in Rome. He fought with the French Foreign Legion
during World War II, then settled in France and gained citizenship
in 1947.
   One of his most recent major works was a three-hour television
documentary about Nazi Germany, ``From Nuremberg to Nuremberg.'' It
was completed three years ago but not broadcast until last year.
   At the time of his death, Rossif was planning to make a film
about Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.

<TEXT>
   The tombstone of the Rev. Ralph David Abernathy,
the civil rights leader, will carry the two-word epitaph he chose
before his death: ``I tried.''
   ``That was more or less his motto. But in my eyes, he did more
than try. He made a difference,'' said Abernathy's son, state Rep.
Ralph David Abernathy III.
   The elder Abernathy, who was a friend and confidante to the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr. but was spurned by civil rights colleagues
last year for discussing King's alleged infidelity in his memoirs,
died Tuesday at Crawford Long Hospital. He was 64.
   Abernathy, who suffered strokes in 1983 and 1986, died of
coronary arrest brought on by a blood clot in the lung, hospital
spokesman Mendal Bouknight said Wednesday. Abernathy had been in
the hospital since March 23 for treatment of a sodium deficiency.
   The younger Abernathy, in an interview Tuesday night with The
Atlanta Journal, said his father would want to be remembered ``as a
man of God, or better yet a soldier of God first, a man of peace
and a man of love.''
   ``I serve in the Georgia House of Representatives because of the
work my father did, but he always told me I wouldn't be free until
everyone was free,'' the son said.
   Former President Jimmy Carter, following a speech at a private
college in Williamsburg, Ky., said: ``I thought Ralph Abernathy was
a great man. ... I think that as the years go by, Abernathy is
going to get more and more credit from people who look at his
actual accomplishments.''
   Friends and family came and went quietly Wednesday from the
single-story, white brick Abernathy home in southwest Atlanta. A
Fulton County policewoman stationed inside the house for security
said Abernathy's wife, Juanita, would make no comment.
   The funeral was scheduled for noon Monday at West Hunter Street
Baptist Church, where Abernathy had been pastor since 1961.
   A memorial service was to be held at 7:30 p.m. Sunday at West
Hunter Street Baptist Church. Following the service, the public may
view the body.
   Abernathy shared 17 jail cells with King, marched with him in
Selma and cradled his bloody head when King was killed in Memphis.
But civil rights leaders who had worked with Abernathy during those
years criticized him in 1989 following publication of his
autobiography, ``And The Walls Came Tumbling Down.''
   In the book, Abernathy wrote that King had spent time with two
women and had argued with a third in the 24 hours before his
assassination.
   Among those criticizing Abernathy for the book was Jesse
Jackson. But on Wednesday, Jackson was among those who praised
Abernathy for his role in the civil rights movement.
   ``The benefits of his service to the common people of America
and the world will never be lost,'' Jackson said in a statement
issued from Washington, D.C.
   ``I have marched with him. I have debated with him. I have
argued with him. I have disagreed with him. I have learned from
him...,'' Jackson said.
   From his office in Los Angeles, former President Ronald Reagan
issued a statement calling Abernathy ``a man of great courage and
totally unselfish dedication to the most just cause known to
mankind _ ending discrimination.''

amending the Taft-Hartley Act and clearing the way for a Boston
hotel workers union and other employees across the country to
negotiate for housing benefits.
   Wednesday's signing affects not only the Boston local but every
union and employee association in the country.
   ``It's much more than just a housing trust for a handful of
workers,'' said Dominic Bozzotto, president of the Hotel Workers
Local 26 in Boston. ``It says that there are employers out there
who understand that they have to stabilize neighborhoods and
communities in order to have a workforce.''
   Without ceremony or fanfare, Bush signed the bill at the White
House, according to Bruce Marks, Local 26 housing director.
   It was Local 26 that in 1988 negotiated an unprecedented
agreement with nine Boston hotels requiring the employers to put
money into a housing trust fund that could be used to finance
housing purchases and rentals. The 5,000-member local needed a
technical amendment to the Taft-Hartley Act before the agreement
could be legal.
   ``We're going to be able to provide housing assistance within
the next month,'' Marks said.
   Taft-Hartley, the nation's overriding labor relations law for 43
years, includes anti-corruption provisions that prohibit management
from making direct payments to unions except for certain purposes
such as employee education, health care and retirement. The
amendment adds housing to that list.
   An unusual political coalition developed around the legislation.
It included the Boston area employers who support the measure
because it will enable them to retain a stable workforce in a
costly housing market; Reagan and Bush administration officials who
backed the bill because it accomplished a social goal without
involving tax dollars; and Massachusetts Democrats including Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy and House Rules Committee Chairman Joe Moakley,
longtime backers of the labor movement.
   ``What the whole exercise proves is that you can get a broad
coalition to come together around social responsibility,'' Bozzotto
said. ``It shows that the idea of the large community where the
strong take care of the week is alive and well in our society.''

<HEAD>`Spunk,' Three Stories by Zora Neale Hurston, Adapted for the
Stage</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs planned.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   ``Spunk'' is an apt title for George C. Wolfe's
stage adaptation of three short stories by Zora Neale Hurston.
   The playlets, which opened Wednesday at off-Broadway's New York
Shakespeare Festival, are gutsy, gritty and often very funny
examinations of black life, both in the South and up North, during
the 1920s.
   Wolfe, author of that satiric look at black history called ``The
Colored Museum,'' uses song, mime, dance and story theater
techniques to make Hurston's stories come alive. Under his
direction, they have made the leap from page to stage with an
irresistible theatricality.
   The first play, ``Sweat,'' is a familiar tale of a woman done
wrong by her man. Delia, a religious, hard-working laundress, is
increasingly battered by her philandering husband. Her revenge is
positively serpentine. Danitra Vance personifies the woman's
sweetness, while Reggie Montgomery portrays her doomed helpmate
with a stylish sense of evil.
   Style also carries ``Story in Harlem Slang,'' an uproarious
confrontation between two Harlem dandies who work hard at doing
nothing at all. If their dialogue is often incomprehensible, the
meaning is very clear as they attempt to cadge free meals from
passing women. Montgomery and K. Todd Freeman play the preening
roosters who don't miss a word or a beat as they strut their stuff.
And the theater program contains a glossary of the more arcane
terms for audiences who have to know every word.
   The longest play, ``The Gilded Six-Bits,'' forms the second half
of the evening. It meanders a bit, and the story it tells is also
one of love betrayed. But this time the victim is a husband whose
wife falls for a wealthier man. And unlike the curtain-raiser,
``The Gilded Six-Bits'' is a plea for forgiveness that succeeds.
   The three sories are punctuated by some wonderful music, mostly
blues, written and performed by the oddly named Chic Street Man. He
is assisted by Ann Duquesnay, a woman who can sing and sashay with
the best of them.
   Hurston's stories are testaments to the human spirit. Her people
are more than just survivors. They thrive in adversity. In
``Spunk,'' Wolfe has managed to document the way they flourish with
grace, good humor and affection.

<HEAD>CDC to Require Special Permit for Importation of Lab Monkeys</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The national Centers for Disease Control on
Wednesday effectively shut down the importation of research monkeys
into the United States until importers present plans to combat a
potentially deadly virus.
   The CDC announced that no rhesus, cynomolgus or African green
monkeys may imported into this country _ or distributed out of
quarantine _ unless accompanied by a special permit issued by the
CDC director.
   The decision came amid concerns over an Ebola virus strain
detected in shipments of laboratory monkeys from three Philippines
importers.
   The permits must be issued at least 30 days prior to
importation, which effectively suspends all imports for one month,
even by those animal dealers not affected by the suspension of
three major importers in March.
   At least one of the three suspended facilities, Charles River
Primates Corp. of Port Washington, N.Y., was reinstated earlier
this month.
   ``These three species of monkeys are capable of being an animal
host ... of human disease,'' The CDC said in announcing the new
restrictions on importing the three species.
   The CDC reported earlier this month that four animal handlers
have become infected with a presumed Ebola virus carried by
Philippine lab monkeys, although none have become ill. That's in
contrast to patterns of infection with African Ebola virus, which
typically attacks suddenly and produces serious, and often fatal,
illness.
   Importers wishing to deal in laboratory monkeys must now submit
to the CDC director a written plan outlining measures ``to prevent
exposure of persons and animals during the entire importation and
quarantine process,'' the CDC said.
   Researchers believe that as many as 10 percent of the lab
monkeys coming into the United States have been infected with a
filovirus _ the family of viruses including Ebola virus.

   A bomb ripped through a packed bus
stand in a village near the Afghan border Wednesday, killing three
people and wounding 30, the government news agency said.
   No one claimed responsiblity for the explosion in Parachinar,
along Pakistan's rugged border with Afghanistan.
   Scores of people have died and hundreds more have been wounded
in bomb explosions that regularly rock cities and villages in
Pakistan's Northwest Frontier province.
   Police refused to speculate on who may have planted Wednesday's
bomb, though in the past they have often blamed agents of
Afghanistan's Communist government.
   U.S.-backed rebels, waging a 12-year war with Kabul's ruling
Communist government, are headquartered in Pakistan.
   More than 3 million Afghan war refugees have fled to Pakistan
since 1979, when Soviet soldiers marched into the Central Asian
nation to prop up an allied Communist government and put down a
burgeoning Moslem insurgency.
   Last year Moscow withdrew its soldiers in line with a United
Nations-brokered accord. The Moslem insurgents have said they would
continue their fight until Kabul's Marxist government has been
toppled.

   President Fidel Castro said the Soviet Union
is strengthening economic ties with Cuba despite domestic problems,
the Cuban news agency said Wednesday.
   On Tuesday, the two countries signed an agreement calling for an
8.7 percent increase in trade and no cuts in Soviet sugar imports.
In 1989 the Soviets purchased more than half of Cuba's sugar
production.
   Also Tuesday, the head of the Soviet trade delegation, Leonid
Abalkin, met with Castro and toured sports and oil installations,
the Prensa Latina dispatch monitored in Mexico said.
   ``I can tell you that the contacts and the conversations were
held in a very friendly atmosphere, one of great mutual
understanding and of the best will on both sides to help satisfy
the needs of the other,'' Castro was quoted as saying.
   Castro said the Soviet Union is ``making a great effort, in the
midst of its own difficulties, to continue development of economic
relations with this country.''
   But he said democratic changes in Eastern Europe had left Cuba
with a smaller circle of friends. Castro has vowed to uphold his
country's socialist system rather than implement democratic and
economic reforms.
   When asked if he ever planned to leave office, Castro said that
politicians, doctors, painters and writers never retire, the press
agency said.

<TEXT>
   The government on Wednesday lifted a
ban on public meetings and relinquished the right to commandeer
property and vehicles for safety reasons.
   The measures were among tough emergency regulations imposed in
June to counter a violent anti-government campaign by Sinhalese
radicals, who opposed government concessions to the minority Tamil
population.
   A government statement said the regulations banning the meetings
and permitting the seizure of property and vehicles were repealed.
   ``It is the desire of the government to lift the emergency
altogether as soon as possible,' the statement said.
   At least 7,000 people have died in the insurgency, which came in
a backlash to government concessions to the mostly Hindu Tamils,
who make up 18 percent of the population. The mainly Buddhist
Sinhalese make up 74 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people.
   More than 11,000 people were killed since 1983 in a separatist
Tamil insurgency. The government and the leading Tamil rebel group,
the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, reached an accord last summer
under which they jointly police the Tamil-dominated north and east.
   The Tamil Tigers, however, still want independence, and the
government not announced future plans for the region.

   Entertainer Ben Vereen was ordered Wednesday
to pay $7,500 to an aquaintance who claimed he broke into her home
and assaulted her. In exchange for the money, the woman agreed to
return Vereen's Les Brown recordings.
   Superior Court Judge Pro Tem Robert Zakon signed a three-page
handwritten agreement worked out by attorneys that also stipulates
Vereen and Christine Rich must stay at least 100 yards apart.
   In a complaint filed the day after the alleged March 1 attack,
Ms. Rich claimed Vereen kicked in her apartment door and assaulted
her. The actor ``grabbed my arm causing injuries, grabbed my neck,
clothing and threw me to the ground,'' she said.
   ``I was able to dial 911 and the police arrived and placed
defendant under arrest,'' she continued. ``I was placed in fear for
my life and suffered great emotional distress requiring immediate
therapy treatment.''
   Under terms of the agreement, Vereen will pay Ms. Rich $7,500
and she will return ``two Les Brown tapes, any and all answering
machine tapes and photographs of (Vereen) and letters from (Vereen)
in her possession at any time.''
   The agreement also prohibits Vereen and Ms. Rich from discussing
the case. The exact relationship between Vereen and Ms. Rich was
not known.
   Vereen, who appeared in the movie ``All That Jazz'' and such
television miniseries as ``Roots,'' and ``Ellis Island,'' didn't
attend the court proceeding.

<TEXT>
   About 75 earthquakes jolted Northern
California on Wednesday, the anniversary of the catastrophic Great
Quake of 1906. The temblors were aftershocks of the October quake
that killed 67, geologists said.
   There were no reports of injuries or major damage from Wednesday
morning's quakes, the largest measuring up to 5.4 on the Richter
scale. Eight others registered at least 3.3.
   The temblors on the San Andreas Fault were felt from San
Francisco to King City, 150 miles south. The San Andreas also
caused the 1906 and Oct. 17 quakes.
   ``All the memories came back to the kids _ this one
especially,'' Darrell Daniels said with his 4-year-old daughter,
Eleth, on his lap.
   ``She won't let me go.''
   The family is living in a mobile home because their home in
downtown Watsonville was condemned after the October quake.
   Wednesday's aftershocks were centered about four miles east of
Watsonville, 60 miles south of San Francisco. October's
7.1-magnitude quake caused major damage to the farming community.
   The temblors began at 6:38 a.m., shortly after a group of Great
Quake surivors gathered in San Francisco to commemorate the 1906
disaster. The strongest quake Wednesday struck at 6:54 a.m. In all,
about 75 were recorded, according to Pat Jorgenson, a spokeswoman
for the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park.
   Nine quakes of 3.3 or larger were recorded, the USGS said.
   Including the latest temblors, the number of aftershocks from
the October quake registering 3.0 or more grew to 115. Of those, 38
had magnitudes of 4.0 or larger.
   The University of California-Berkeley Seismographic Station said
the strongest quake Wednesday had a preliminary reading of 5.4 on
the Richter scale. Allen Lindh of the USGS also issued a
preliminary report of 5.4.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number, for example from
magnitude 5.5 to magnitude 6.5, means that the ground motion is 10
times greater.
   ``We are considering them aftershocks. They occurred in the same
location of other aftershocks of Loma Prieta,'' said David
Oppenheimer, a Geological Survey seismologist. Loma Prieta was the
name given to October's quake.
   He said aftershocks from a magnitude-7.1 quake can continue for
two years.
   ``We figured it was all over,'' said Robert Holleson, a former
Watsonville resident who was visiting Wednesday. ``But the power's
off, the phone's dead, helicopters are flying all over. It's like
it's starting all over again.''
   Early damage reports from the Watsonville area were light, with
some dishes broken and small rockslides on Highway 152 into
Watsonville. San Francisco police said many worried residents
called, but no damage was reported.
   Ron Rutkowski, spokesman for Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co., said
about 11,000 customers in the Watsonville and Santa Cruz area lost
power. All service was restored by noon.
   Wednesday marked the 84th anniversary of the 1906 quake, which
struck at 5:13 a.m. on April 18. Although the Richter scale didn't
exist then, it was later determined that the quake's magnitude was
8.3.
   For decades it was believed that about 700 people died in the
1906 earthquake. But in recent years, research by San Francisco
City Archivist Gladys Hansen documented at least 2,500 deaths, and
she has said the real toll may be much higher.
   About 150 people gathered Wednesday at Lotta's Fountain in
downtown San Francisco by 5:13 a.m. Some were heading to another
commemoration when the first tremor occurred.
   ``One or two of the survivors commented that it didn't faze them
at all as they had experienced THE big one,'' said organizer Taren
Sapienza.
   The October quake caused more than $7 billion in damage and
rattled residents who used to shrug off small temblors. That quake
caused a double-deck section of Interstate 880 in Oakland to
collapse, killing 42 people. Parts of three freeways that were
damaged remain closed.
   On Tuesday, exactly six months after the quake, more than 100
people mingled at an earthquake-preparedness rally at San
Francisco's Justin Herman Plaza, a few yards from the ruined
Embarcadero Freeway.
   Around the plaza, people manned display tables, where pamphlets
and disaster checklists were handed out. Pictures of the October
earthquake destruction also were on review.
   At Watsonville's mobile home park, Jimmie Henson said even
though Wednesday's quakes were smaller than October's, they were
more destructive for her. The tremors caused cracks in the walls of
her home and broke dishes and other small objects.
   ``I'm more upset today than I was from the big one _ much
more,'' she said.

<HEAD>Ivory Prices Fall Following International Ban on Trade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GLAND, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An international ban on trade in ivory
has sent prices plummeting on most traditional markets, the World
Conservation Union said Wednesday.
   In several countries, shrinking demand also has led to reduced
poaching, a study by the group said. Poaching was blamed as a major
factor in reducing Africa's elephant population from 1.3 million to
about 610,000 in the past 15 years.
   The treaty to protect the dwindling herds took effect Jan. 18,
following a 103-nation meeting in October of members of the
Convention on Trade in Endangered Species.
   It bans trade in ivory and all other elephant products. Five
southern African nations which regularly cull their elephant
populations _ Botswana, Malawi, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe _
filed for exemptions. China has declared it will continue to import
the tusks.
   The World Conservation Union study says ivory prices in Africa,
Europe and Africa fell significantly although they rose somewhat in
Japan where ``high internal demand remains.''
   The study cautioned, however, that with stockpiles rising
because of natural mortality and confiscations, there is growing
danger that much of this ivory will enter trade through nations
that did not sign the treaty.
   It said the large quantities of stockpiled ivory, at least 250
tons in Africa and another 580 tons in consumer countries, thus
``may foster new markets, which will be difficult if not impossible
to control.''

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III warned
Wednesday that action by Moscow against Lithuania could doom
commercial U.S.-Soviet relations as the administration sought
details on reports of an oil cutoff.
   ``It's very difficult to see some of the commercial aspects of
our relationship surviving the use of force or coercion'' against
the independence-minded Baltic republic, Baker told the House Ways
and Means Committee at a hearing on East Bloc economic reform.
   Baker spoke just hours before Lithuanian spokesmen said the
Soviet Union shut off the supply of oil to Lithuania's only
refinery, imposing part of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's threatened
economic embargo.
   ``We've seen the reports,'' said White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater. ``We don't have any independent verification. We are
looking into it. We want to analyze the situation and I don't
expect any response tonight.''
   President Bush, in an interview with the ``World Monitor''
television show sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor
broadcast Wednesday night on the Discovery Channel of cable
systems, declined to answer a question about whether the United
States would supply oil to Lithuania. He said the question was
``too hypothetical.''
   Prodded that an aswer would ``be a message,'' Bush said, ``I
understand that; I have a chance ... to send messages every single
minute, and I don't elect to do that.''
   Bush said he had not spoken with Lithuania's president, and had
not spoken with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev since the Soviet
oil threat last Friday.
   Fitzwater also said that the White House had received a private
letter from Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis.
   ``The letter was delivered to the State Department and forwarded
to the White House. The president has not seen it yet but he will.
We won't comment on the content,'' Fitzwater said.
   Lithuania's U.S. representative, Stasyas Lozoraitis Jr., said
the letter was written March 19, about a week after the Lithuanian
parliament declared independence, and brought out of the country by
a traveler because the Lithuanian government did not trust Soviet
handling of its mail.
   The letter ``simply explains the situation'' to Bush and said,
``We ask your political support,'' without making specific requests
for help, Lozoraitis said.
   It was followed by letters to Pope John Paul II and French
President Francois Mitterrand and others, the envoy said.
   He said he expects Landsbergis to write again.
   Baker, reading a carefully drafted statement at the
congressional hearing, made it clear that U.S. action in response
to any crackdown on by Gorbachev would be dictated by U.S.
interests.
   He then listed areas of U.S.-Soviet cooperation that are in the
interest of the United States, including ridding former stellite
countries of Soviet military presence, conventional and nuclear
arms control and economic reform in the Soviet Union.
   ``But some of our bilateral commercial contacts with the Soviet
Union may be more directly in their interest than in ours,'' Baker
added, inserting the word ``commercial,'' which did not appear in
his written text.
   ``And those contacts are being put to risk by Soviet actions in
Lithuania,'' he said. ``Our willingness and ability to take steps
that benefit perestroika (economic and political restructuring) in
the near term is, to be sure, affected by Soviet behavior.
   ``Perestroika, glasnost and democratization cannot be divisible.
The reform process won't go forward and succeed if it is applied in
some republics but not in others.''
   Asked by reporters to clarify what commercial relationships
would be endangered, Baker declined.
   Elsewhere in his testimony, Baker described ongoing talks on a
U.S.-Soviet trade agreement, which coupled with codification of
emigration reform could lead to most-favored-nation trading status
for the Soviet Union.
   He also referred to future possibilities of lifting restrictions
on U.S. lending to the Soviet Union, and to a bilateral investment
treaty and a revised tax treaty.
   Gorbachev threatened last week to impose an embargo of critical
supplies unless Lithuania rescinded within 48 hours several laws
meant to bolster its March 11 declaration of independence.
   Lithuanian leaders have made no move to meet Gorbachev's
demands, but say they are willing to negotiate. Gorbachev refuses
to meet with them until they rescind their declaration of
independence.
   In his testimony, Baker said it was time for the Soviets to
begin a dialogue with the Lithuanians about how to resolve the
question of independence.
   ``The Lithuanians want such a dialogue,'' he said. ``It seems to
us that is the answer to the problem: dialogue, not economic
boycotts, and not threats to invoke presidential rule.''
   Members of the tax and trade panel generally welcomed the
administration's cautious approach to the Lithuania problem. A
typical comment came from liberal Rep. Tom Downey, D-N.Y.
   Some ``would love an excuse to jump-start the cold war,'' Downey
said, adding that ``the measured response you have given to date is
going to prove to be the correct one in the long sweep of history.''

<TEXT>
   Two former drug counselors who were fired
for eating psychedelic peyote as part of their religious practices
expressed dismay that the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against them,
but one said he won't give up.
   ``Maybe a battle's lost, but the war's not over,'' said Al
Smith, 70, of Glenwood. ``I've lost battles before.''
   In Arizona, leaders of the Hopi and Navajo tribes on Wednesday
criticized the decision Tuesday by the nation's highest court. The
ruling upheld Oregon officials' decision to deny unemployment
benefits to Smith and Galen Black of Cottage Park.
   Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the 6-3 majority, said it
``would be courting anarchy'' to let a few do what is illegal for
everyone else.
   Dissenting justices said the ruling permits religious oppression
of Indians, a view supported by Indian spiritual leaders.
   Black said the ruling went beyond a cultural slap and
dehumanized everyone involved in the case.
   ``I'm astounded they've taken the people out and the law-book
mentality is the only thing they know,'' he said Tuesday. ``They
can't see that these people (who eat peyote) are searching out for
something. Those people are searching for a little peace and
tranquility within themselves.''
   Smith, a Klamath Indian and recovering alcoholic, said he
frequently attends Native American Church meetings and uses peyote,
a small, button-shaped cactus containing the hallucinogen
mescaline. Smith said the substance's effect in a church setting is
spiritual rather than recreational.
   Black, who is not an Indian, also has attended church meetings.
   Black and Smith were fired after breaking a policy of ADAPT, the
non-profit rehabilitation organization they worked for in Douglas
County, Ore., by eating small amounts of peyote as part of a Native
American Church sacrament.
   Smith said the effect of state Attorney General Dave
Frohnmayer's case against him is ``cultural genocide'' in Oregon,
and conflicts with the ideals of the framers of the U.S.
Constitution.
   ``It's very important,'' Smith said. ``If the First Amendment
doesn't protect me, how the hell's it going to protect you?''
   The Native American Church is an umbrella group that claims at
least 250,000 members belonging to 70 church chapters that practice
the peyote ritual in 23 Western states.
   In Window Rock, Ariz., on Wednesday, interim Navajo Chairman
Leonard Haskie said the ruling would affect many in the
200,000-member tribe who belong to the church.
   ``The ruling indicates the need to educate the U.S. government,
state governments and society in general of the beliefs and
practices of the Native American Church,'' Haskie said in a
statement issued in the Navajo reservation's capital.
   Haskie said church members believe peyote use as a sacrament is
as old as the origin of the Navajos.
   He said the Navajo government would do whatever was necessary to
ensure that legal exemptions allowing religious use of peyote will
continue in states surrounding the reservation. The reservation,
which covers an area the size of West Virginia, sprawls across much
of northeastern Arizona and into New Mexico and Utah.
   Haskie also called on members of Congress to strengthen
safeguards against governmental encroachment on individual rights.
   In the Hopi capital of Kykotsmovi, Ariz., tribal Chairman Vernon
Masyesva called the Supreme Court's decision ``unfortunate.''
   Masayesva said religious rights should be inviolable by any
considerations but national interests.

   The Colombian Defense Ministry said
weapons sold by Israel to a Caribbean island-nation mysteriously
ended up in the hands of the powerful Medellin drug cartel,
newspapers reported Wednesday.
   The weapons were originally sold by Israel in early 1989 to the
tiny country of Antigua and Barbuda, according to a communique
released Tuesday by the Defense Ministry. The communique, signed by
Defense Minister Oscar Botero, was published Wednesday in daily
newspapers.
   Soldiers found 232 Israeli-made weapons in February during a
search of ranches seized from Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, a major drug
trafficker who was killed in a December gun battle with police,
Botero said.
   A Feb. 2 search of one ranch owned by Rodriguez Gacha turned up
more than 100 of the Israeli weapons and $3.2 million in cash,
Botero said.
   The weapons found at the drug trafficker's ranches included
assault rifles, machine guns, submachine guns, pistols,
shoulder-fired rockets and infrared night scopes, the communique
said.
   The defense minister said the seized Israeli weapons originally
were sold to Antigua and Barbuda, but authorities have not been
determined how the weapons wound up with Medellin drug traffickers.
   He said authorities in Israel and the Caribbean nation were
investigating the matter.
   A spokeswoman for the Israeli Embassy in Bogota, Anna Cecilia de
Nieto, said the embassy would have no comment on the communique.
   On Feb. 5, Colombia privately complained about the weapons to
the Israeli government.
   The Israeli government told Colombia last month that the weapons
discovered at Rodriguez Gacha's property had been sold by Israel to
Antigua and Barbuda last year, Botero said.
   The minister said Colombia issued a formal protest to Antigua
and Barbuda on April 3. Since the two countries do not have
diplomatic relations, the protest was issued through the
Organization of American States.
   The complaint against the island nation was not made public at
the time.
   The mystery over the Israeli weapons follows a scandal that
broke last year concerning the alleged involvement of Israeli
mercenaries in training the Medellin cartel's private armies.
   The Colombian government has formally charged two Israelis, Yair
Klein and Arik Afek, with complicity with the Medellin cartel.
   Colombian authorities have requested the extradition of Klein, a
former Israeli army lieutenant colonel, who is in Israel.
   Afek was discovered dead on Jan. 24 in the trunk of his parked
car at Miami International Airport in what police describe as a
gangland slaying.
   Colombia's secret police have identified at least five other
alleged Israeli mercenaries who were in the country in 1987.
   Klein has said he was told he was training Colombian ranchers
and peasants to defend themselves against leftist guerrillas.
   But Colombian authorities said the Israelis were actually
training the Medellin cartel's gunmen.
   Investigators determined the cartel had also hired British and
Australian mercenaries to train and equip its army, which is
believed to have as many as 4,000 gunmen.

<TEXT>
   The Louisiana Pardon Board on Wednesday
recommended that Wilbert Rideau, a convicted murderer who became an
award-winning journalist behind bars, be set free after 29 years in
prison.
   The final decision will be made by Gov. Buddy Roemer, who has
cited the viciousness of Rideau's crimes in refusing to commute his
life sentence in the past. After Wednesday's decision, Roemer said
he had no plans to do so now.
   ``It's difficult. I wish I had an easy answer. But my
inclination is not to accept their recommendation,'' the governor
said.
   Rideau said Wednesday in a telephone interview from Louisiana
State Penitentiary in Angola that he'd be a free man now if he'd
spent his time in prison making license plates instead of writing.
   ``I've become distinguished because I did some good over the
years I've been in here,'' he said. ``The problem with doing good
and being productive is that you acquire notoriety and that goes
against getting out.''
   The five-member board voted unanimously to reduce the
48-year-old prison magazine editor's sentence to 55 years, which
defense attorney Julian Murray said would qualify him for immediate
release.
   ``This is the same recommendation this board made in 1988,''
said board Chairwoman Yvonne Campbell. ``It was based on his prison
record, his accomplishments, and he has only had one writeup in his
29 years in prison.''
   Two board members also recommended that Rideau be required to
leave the state permanently, contribute part of the earnings from
his writing to the victims' reparation fund and be ordered to
perform some community service.
   Rideau said, ``I appreciate the board of pardons having once
against expressed their belief in my worth and potential as a human
being.
   ``They have also expressed their continued belief in the
American principle of equal justice, judging me the same way they
judge every other person in this state who has been convicted of
murder and then released.''
   Rideau didn't attend the hearing, but about 30 friends and
supporters did.
   It was the seventh time he has applied for clemency after being
sentenced to death for the 1961 murder of a bank teller in an armed
robbery. His sentence was commuted to life in 1973 when the U.S.
Supreme Court overturned the death penalty.
   Murray Henderson, former warden of the state prison at Angola,
told the board he'd known Rideau for 20 years.
   ``I have seen a man who has changed, who has grown, who has
developed into a mature, hard-working person,'' Henderson said.
``He should have been released 15 years ago, or at least 10. I
don't know what more he can do. ...
   ``Certainly no useful purpose could be served by his continued
incarceration,'' Henderson said. ``You could send him to Harvard
cheaper than you could keep him there.''
   Former state Secretary of Corrections Paul Phelps also urged
that Rideau be released.
   Others, however, argued against clemency.
   Frank Salter, one of the prosecutors at Rideau's trial, noted
that, because of appeals Rideau won, he was tried three times and
sentenced to death each time.
   ``The vote was 36-0 for the death penalty,'' Salter said.
``Wilbert Rideau has had his clemency.''
   Rick Bryant, an assistant prosecutor in Calcasieu Parish, called
the premeditated robbery and murder one of the most heinous ever in
the parish.
   ``I've spoken with people who are still terrified of Wilbert
Rideau,'' Bryant said. ``We do believe Mr. Rideau has received his
clemency. He's not dead.''
   The Parole Board has recommended clemency for Rideau three times
since 1984, and governors have refused to grant clemency each time.
The last time was in 1988, under Roemer.
   Rideau said Wednesday he was dismayed that the governor appeared
to make a decision after only listening to a survivor of his crime.
   ``Everything else _ the hearing, the pardon board decision,
everything else _ is a hollow finality,'' he said.
   Rideau was sentenced to die in the electric chair for the murder
of Gulf National Bank teller Julia Ferguson after the 1961 holdup
in the southwest Louisiana town of Lake Charles.
   Rideau, then 19, forced two tellers and the branch manager, all
of whom he knew, into a car at gunpoint, drove them to a deserted
road and shot all three.
   When Mrs. Ferguson begged for her life, Rideau cut her throat
and stabbed her in the heart. She was the only one who died.
   Rideau's prison prose earned him and his magazine, the Angolite,
national honors, including the Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award,
the American Bar Association's Silver Gavel Award and the George
Polk Award for special interest reporting.
   It also has allowed him to travel, with guards. Two weeks ago,
Rideau went to the American Society of Newspaper Editors' meeting
in Washington to speak about prison journalism.
   Rideau says he has offers of journalism jobs if he can get out
of prison. But he worries that his case attracts so much attention
it puts extra pressure on the governor.

<HEAD>Exxon Cleanup of Prince William Sound To Begin</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The cleanup of environmentally
sensitive areas of Prince William Sound fouled by the Exxon Valdez
oil spill may resume as early as Friday, Exxon Corp. and government
officials said Wednesday.
   A boat carrying Exxon's first 1990 cleanup crew will be ready to
begin work then, said Andy Teal, coordinator of Exxon's shoreline
cleanup assessment team.
   The crew may initially begin cleaning sea bird rookeries and
areas where seals and sea lions congregate, Teal said, in order to
minimize disrupting nesting activities in May.
   The need to clean those sites is not yet certain, however. He
said the first sites to be cleaned will not be determined until the
federal coordinator on the scene gives the go-ahead.
   The coordinator, Rear Adm. David Ciancaglini, is expected to
begin approving site cleanup recommendations soon, said Coast Guard
spokesman Ernest Del Bueno.
   The general cleanup of remaining oiled shorelines in Prince
William Sound and the Gulf of Alaska begins May 1, Exxon officials
said.
   The 1989 cleanup was halted Sept. 15 in anticipation of winter.
   Hundreds of miles of shoreline in Prince William Sound were
covered with an oily goo when the tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground
on a charted reef on March 24, 1989, spilling nearly 11 million
gallons of North Slope crude oil. Countless fish, otters, other
mammals and sea birds were killed.
   Exxon says it spent more than $2 billion in last year's cleanup,
hiring more than 10,000 workers and leasing more than 1,000 boats
for the operation. The company says it plans a greatly reduced
cleanup this year.
   A technical advisory group composed of representatives of the
Coast Guard, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,
the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation and Exxon has
been meeting for a week to determine cleanup methods for about 600
shoreline sites.
   Recommendations include simply picking up tar-laden mats coating
rocky shorelines, and raking, shoveling and using backhoes or other
equipment to remove deep-seated oil from rocks and soil.
   Proposals also include spraying fertilizer or chemicals on
beaches to break down the remaining oil.
   Certain cleanup methods have created some controversy, and state
regulators have not yet said whether they will approve the use of
fertilizers on shorelines or the introduction of large machinery.
   Exxon and a subsidiary, Exxon Shipping Co., are scheduled to go
on trial in U.S. District Court in Anchorage on June 18 on two
felony charges and three misdemeanors in the spill.
   The skipper of the Exxon Valdez, Capt. Joseph Hazelwood, was
convicted last month of a misdemeanor charge of negligent discharge
of oil into state waters, but was acquitted of more serious charges.

<HEAD>UPI Asks Appeals Court to Continue Reuters Picture Exchange</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 2 grafs to UPDATE with UPI comment.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer for United Press International told a
federal appeals court Wednesday it could go out of business if
Reuters is allowed to terminate a photo exchange agreement.
   Three judges of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reserved
decision on UPI's request for an injunction barring Reuters from
terminating the contract.
   The judges, however, extended an earlier stay that keeps the
agreement in effect until they issue a written decision.
   The contract between the news services was made in 1984 and
called for UPI to supply Reuters with pictures from the United
States and for Reuters to provide UPI with pictures from other
countries. It was to run for 10 years beginning in 1985.
   ``We will immediately lose customers the minute Reuters cuts us
off,'' UPI lawyer Mitchell Karlan told the court. ``If we are
unable to get pictures from Reuters, UPI is going out of business.''
   UPI is appealing a decision by U.S. District Judge Peter K.
Leisure that the agency had not shown it would be irreparably
harmed if the arrangement was discontinued.
   The injunction request stemmed from a counterclaim by UPI to a
Reuters lawsuit that seeks to void the picture exchange agreement.
Reuters said the agreement was not living up to expectations.
   Robert Sugarman, an attorney for Reuters, argued against the
injunction on the grounds that UPI had not shown how many customers
it would lose without foreign photos from Reuters.
   Sugarman pointed to testimony from UPI Chairman Earl Brian that
UPI had negotiated to receive foreign photos from the French news
service, Agence France-Presse, for a three-month period in the
event the Reuters contract is discontinued.
   In a statement, Brian said, ``We will continue to pursue UPI's
rights by confronting Reuters' erratic and unwarranted behavior. We
take further encouragement from today's hearing and continuation of
the order against Reuters.
   ``We at UPI consider photos and graphics a strategically vital
component of our business today and in the 1990s,'' he said.

<HEAD>Judge Holds Federal Government to Agreement on Quake Aid</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge ordered the government
Wednesday to carry out an agreement to repair or replace more than
2,200 units of rental housing for people who were displaced by last
October's earthquake.
   U.S. District Judge Eugene Lynch rejected arguments by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency that the agreement was signed
under a misunderstanding and should be cancelled or changed to
limit FEMA's obligations.
   Legal Aid lawyers said FEMA was trying to eliminate more than
two-thirds of the aid it had promised to provide.
   ``Now we can get on with implementation of the agreement,''
attorney Stephen Ronfeldt of the Legal Aid Society of Alameda
County told reporters. ``FEMA's job is to address an emergency, not
to back out of an agreement.''
   He said FEMA is required to make money available to local
government to repair the housing units, build new housing or
provide the former residents with housing vouchers by mid-July. The
agreement covers Alameda, San Francisco and Santa Cruz counties.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney George Stoll said local FEMA officials
were awaiting instructions from Washington.
   The units were in residential hotels and other single-room
rentals that were made uninhabitable by the Oct. 17 quake.
   FEMA was sued by poor people who were denied housing aid because
they had not lived in their last residence at least 30 days, or
because they lived in housing shared with others who received aid.
   In the settlement, signed Feb. 23, FEMA agreed to make funding
available to replace all lost low-income housing units in the three
counties. But a month later, the agency said it did not consider
itself required to replace housing for displaced people who had
found new homes and were receiving temporary cash help from the
government.
   Lynch ruled, however, that FEMA was bound by the agreement,
which required replacement of all the housing units.

<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Writers' Union on Wednesday opened
its first congress since the ouster of Nicolae Ceausescu with a
declaration of political and artistic independence after decades of
following the Communist leader's dictates.
   At its four-day session, the congress plans to pass statutes for
the 1,700-member union calling for political and financial autonomy
of writers from the state.
   Poet Mircea Dinescu, interim chairman of the organization and a
former leading dissident, urged Romanian writers in a keynote
speech to discard fears that prevented them from freely expressing
their thoughts.
   ``Our congress will help us to abandon our fear to speak our
minds,'' Dinescu told a reporter after the meeting.
   He was held under house arrest for more than six months under
Ceausescu, who was executed in December.
   The Writers' Union was run by the Council of Socialist Education
and Culture, a state body which dictated cultural life in Romania
in accordance with Ceausescu's wishes, for more than four decades
of Communist rule.
   The council was dismantled after the December revolution and its
leaders are now in government custody.
   Dinescu said the union now will be free of state censorship and
of the former secret police who used to keep close tabs on free
expression and writers who strayed from established cultural policy.
   ``We now say goodbye to government officials,'' Dinescu told
about 1,000 writers gathered in the Palace Hall, traditional site
of Ceausescu's Communist Party congresses.
   ``We were in the Middle Ages then, but now we will not bow our
pens anymore in front of the government,'' said Stefan Augustin
Doinas, a member of the 30-writer panel presiding over the congress.
   Doinas, a poet jailed by Communists in the early 195Os for
deviating from Moscow-imposed strictures on culture, is expected to
become the union's new chairman at the conclusion of the congress,
delegates said.

   A twin-engine plane carrying 22
people crashed Wednesday minutes after takeoff from Contadora
island when birds were sucked into its right engine, Aeroperlas
airline said. It said 20 people were missing and two were rescued.
   Passenger lists showed four Americans aboard the aircraft, the
airline and control tower said.
   U.S. planes, boats and divers joined Panamanian rescue workers
in the search for survivors of the Twin Otter plane in
120-foot-deep Pacific waters three miles south of the resort, the
U.S. Southern Command said.
   The search was suspended Wednesday night and will resume
Thursday morning, said Panama's director of civil aviation, Jaime
Fabrega.
   The Americans were listed as Anita Heck, Karl Heck, Lisa Larglow
and Richard Poux, according to Panamanian civil aviation sources.
No hometowns and ages were available, and late Wednesday the State
Department in Washington said it had no details on the plane crash
or the Americans on board.
   Asked if other survivors had been located, Fabrega said, ``For
now, no.''
   He told reporters, ``Since we haven't reached the plane, it
would be foolish to say anything more.''
   A statement by the airline blamed the crash on the failure of
the right engine after a group of birds flew into it at takeoff.
Aviation experts say that in such incidents, the impact of the
birds causes the engine's turbines to stop, forcing the plane to
stall.
   The statement added that those rescued and taken to Panama City
were ``Frederick Pirot Jr., 14, and Mrs. Ana Jury.'' The passenger
list shows two others with the name of Pirot _ presumably related
to him.
   Mrs. Jury, of Switzerland, suffered a broken vertebra, and
Pirot, of France, suffered a broken arm, the airline said.
   The rest of the passengers and two crew members were
Panamanians, the Civil Aviation office said.
   The plane was en route from Contadora, about 50 miles southeast
of Panama City, to the capital.
   The Pacific resort island is where former Panamanian leader Omar
Torrijos gave refuge for several months to the Shah of Iran,
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, after the shah's 1979 exile.
   It also was the site of a 1981 meeting by four Latin foreign
ministers, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia and Panama, to negotiate the
first attempts at peace in Central America.

   PLO official Hakam Balawi told U.S.
diplomat Edmund Hull on Tuesday that only an international
conference can bring lasting peace in the Middle East, the official
Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.
   Balawi's comments to Hull, counselor to U.S. Ambassador Robert
Pelletreau, reflect the Palestine Liberation Organization's
long-standing goal of an international conference on the Mideast.
   ``The two men discussed the peace process and international
efforts to give it a new impetus,'' the WAFA communique said.
   The communique criticized Israel for ``obstructing'' peace
efforts.
   Balawi, an adviser to PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, said an
Israeli-Palestinian dialogue could only be a preparatory step
toward an international settlement, the WAFA statement said.
   The meeting follows one Thursday between Balawi and Pelletreau.
The U.S. Embassy in Tunisia became the sole U.S. government body
authorized to hold talks with the PLO after the organization
renounced violence in December 1988.
   The embassy does not comment on its meetings with the PLO.

   Greece on Tuesday warned it would expel a
Syrian diplomat unless he gave a satisfactory explanation to a
statement that appeared to support terrorism.
   Foreign Minister Antonis Samaras summoned Syrian Ambassador
Shahine Farrah and asked him to explain a statement made by the
embassy's economic counselor Mohamed El Sayed in a press release
last week.
   The newspaper Apogevmatini said last week that Sayed had said in
a release that, ``I am an educated and religious man, and naturally
I do not rule out absolutely any form of violence in political
activity.''
   Sayed said the statement was incorrect and that his typist had
added a single letter to its Greek text, changing the meaning of
what he said was intended to be a rejection of violence.
   Government spokesman Vyron Polydoras said: ``The foreign
minister warned that the diplomat in question will be classified
persona non grata, with all that that implies, in the event that
the explanations are not deemed satisfactory.''
   In a telephone interview Sayed said, ``We have sent our
explanation of the mistake to the newspaper. Tomorrow the embassy
will forward it to the Foreign Ministry.''
   In his press release Sayed also denied an April 8 report in
Apogevmatini claiming that he was involved in the assassination of
conservative lawmaker Pavlos Bakoyannis on Sept. 26.
   Bakoyannis, spokesman of the conservative New Democracy party
and son-in-law of newly-elected Premier Constantine Mitsotakis, was
killed by unidentified gunmen.
   The shadowy November 17 leftist terrorist group claimed
responsibility for the murder. The group has killed 14 people since
it first emerged in 1975. None of its members have been arrested.

   The Rev. Ralph David Abernathy, who shared 17
jail cells with Martin Luther King Jr., marched with him in Selma,
cradled his bloody head in Memphis and broke with his followers
over a tell-all memoir, is dead at 64.
   Abernathy died Tuesday at Crawford Long Hospital while being
prepared for a lung scan to locate a suspected blood clot, hospital
spokeswoman Tisha Burland said. The cause of death was not
immediately known.
   As King's chief lieutenant, Abernathy was at his side at almost
every key battle of the civil rights movement of the 1950s and '60s
and took his place as leader of the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference after King's 1968 assassination. But the fame and
adulation enjoyed by King never quite extended to Abernathy.
   In a 1986 interview, he lamented that during a visit to a school

   Diets with about twice the amount of fiber and
vegetables now consumed by most Americans can reduce the risk of
colon cancer by about 40 percent, a government study shows.
   A research report published today in the Journal of the National
Cancer Institute reviewed 37 studies conducted since 1973 and found
what it called ``a great deal of evidence'' that diets rich in
fiber and vegetables protect people against colon cancer.
   ``The data ... suggest a reduction in risk of approximately 40
percent for persons consuming diets high in fiber and vegetables,''
the report said. ``Furthermore, there are undeniable cardiovascular
benefits and little likelihood of adverse consequences associated
with this data.''
   Bruce Trock, a researcher at Fox Chase Cancer Center in
Philadelphia, said the evidence ``is powerful'' and very clear.

   Federal investigators following the money
trail left by Colombian drug dealers say the Medellin cocaine
cartel stashed $400 million in 754 U.S. bank accounts _ most of
them now frozen under court order.
   The Justice Department said it won a court order freezing 684
U.S. bank accounts as a result of a painstaking investigation of
financial transactions used by Colombian drug lords to hide at
least $1.2 billion.
   The order, signed by a federal judge in Atlanta, also directed
173 banks in 22 states and the nation's capital to provide records
to prosecutors.
   The Justice Department said Tuesday its long-running
investigation of Colombian drug dealers, dubbed ``Operation Polar
Cap,'' determined that the accounts once contained $400 million the
Medellin cartel amassed from selling cocaine in America.

   A Ku Klux Klansman arrested for wearing a hood in
violation of state law has his day in court Thursday in a
confrontation over whether the Constitution guarantees the right of
anonymous free speech.
   ``Any law that infringes on any person's First Amendment rights
infringes on all our rights,'' said Michael Hauptman, Klansman
Shade Miller's lawyer.
   Miller was charged with violating the 1951 law in February after
wearing a KKK hood at the county courthouse in Lawrenceville.
   The case is being watched closely by civil rights leaders, who
credit the law with helping reduce Klan violence in the last four
decades.

<HEAD>PBS Havel Documentary Really is History</HEAD>

   Imagine a life in which you're banned from
practicing your profession. Teacher? You can't teach. Painter? Put
away those brushes. Playwright? You will never see your work
performed in your own country.
   Worse, the government will incarcerate you for defying those
rules. And when you're not in prison, it will find you work _ as a
cab driver and a brewery worker.
   This was the life of Vaclav Havel, the dissident Czechoslovakian
playwright who now leads a country still hungover from the
intoxicating revolution that has rewritten its history.
   To get a gut feeling for what Havel's life has been like lately,
watch ``Havel's Audience with History'' on PBS Friday.
   Hosted by Paul Newman, the documentary chronicles the first
public performance of a Havel play in Czechoslovakia.
   It is January, and Havel has been president for two weeks. The
play, titled ``Audience,'' is 15 years old and the new
Czechoslovakian leader is in the emotional audience. His disheveled
manner makes him one of the world's most unlikely presidential
candidates.
   The play premiered Jan. 8 at the Cinoherni Club, just off
Wenceslas Square, the site of Czechoslovakia's mass demonstrations.
The fact it debuted at all was due to two New York-based
documentary producers who thought ``God, we've got to do this.''
   Robert Kanter and Michael Wolkowitz first saw ``Audience''
performed in New York by Newman's Actors Studio. That was December,
and Czechoslovakia's ``Velvet Revolution'' was in full tilt.
   What if, Kanter and Wolkowitz thought, we took this production
to Prague? In 47 days, they arranged the financing, secured Havel's
blessings, lugged a crew onto a trans-Atlantic flight and completed
filming.
   ``We never stopped to question it,'' said Kanter, 37, in a phone
interview from New York. ``From the beginning, we thought this was
something we had to do.''
   But seeing it become a reality was overwhelming.
   ``I cried, Michael cried. It was probably the most incredible
theatrical experience of my life,'' he said.
   Foreign correspondent Dan Fisher, who covered the ``Velvet
Revolution'' for the Los Angeles Times, also was in the
``Audience'' audience.
   ``To actually see it done in public is something else,'' Fisher
said in a phone interview from London.
   ``Audience,'' laden with obscenities and chock-full of
absurdity, showcases a sodden conversation between a sleazy,
communist brewmaster and the blacklisted playwright forced to work
for him.
   Havel molded the playwright after himself. The brewmaster is a
composite of brewery workers he was ordered to work with.
   The country prohibited its publication, but Czechoslovakians
typed the play and passed it through the underground. It was so
well-read that hitchhikers could recite it verbatim.
   Kanter and Wolkowitz's production ran four performances. Two
were in English _ featuring the Actors Studio cast _ and two in
Czech, starring Czech actors.
   In the Czech version of the two-character, one-act play, exiled
actor Pavel Landovsky, a longtime friend of Havel's, walked onto a
Czechoslovakian stage for the first time in 12 years.
   In the documentary, alongside outtakes of the ``Audience''
performances, interviews and film clips chronicle Havel's long and
torturous battle as playwright and dissident.
   The new president is left-handed, writes at night and can't chop
wood worth a darn, we learn from his wife, Olga.
   Childhood pal and lifetime friend, film director Milos Forman,
says that in school, Havel ``was the most shy, inconspicuous kid.''
   That is obvious while watching Havel address the Cinoherni Club
audience, which was double the theater's capacity and spilled out
onto the street, where television monitors had been mounted.
   The president alternately stared at his fingernails and picked
at his moustache while talking to theater-goers that included new
heads of state, U.S. congressmen and American Ambassador Shirley
Temple Black.
   To get to the Cinoherni Club, Havel drove himself.
   The irony of Havel's work is perhaps best summed up by Forman,
who notes during the PBS documentary:
   ``The good news is that Vaclav Havel is the president of
Czechoslovakia. The bad news is that he can't ever write plays
again.''

   Elsewhere in Television ...
   WHOLE LOT OF HAVEL: If you're interested in seeing more of
Havel's work, tune in early Friday. PBS will broadcast Havel's
``Largo Desolato,'' starring Oscar-winner F. Murray Abraham, Phoebe
Cates and Sally Kirkland. This play also draws on Havel's life,
focusing on two days in the life of a dissident writer who is
waiting for the knock at the door that may send him to prison.

<HEAD>Kemp Stands Out As Activist in Largely Passive Cabinet</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jack Kemp, according to Jack Kemp, is a
bleeding heart conservative supply side progressive suburban
Republican, and never mind the commas. That compound description
comes in one burst.
   Kemp is an activist in a relatively passive administration. And
glad to be there, he says, on the team, not the pitcher or the
catcher but nevertheless fielding an important position in the
George Bush lineup. It is a politically delicate position because
he inherited a Republican scandal.
   ``I'm not the Republican National Committee chairman, as I tell
anybody who wants me to come in to speak in their district,'' Kemp
says. ``I'm the secretary of housing and urban development.''
   As the boss of the Cabinet agency that bequeathed this
administration a Reagan-era scandal over political
influence-peddling and federal grants, Kemp says he has rationed
his role in the 1992 congressional campaign.
   ``Do I go? Yes,'' he said over his rapidly cooling salmon lunch.
``Am I careful? Yes ... I don't want this to be confused with the
Republican committee, as it was in the past.''
   Nor, Kemp said, should he be confused with the candidate he was
in the past.
   Not now, anyhow.
   He is purposefully vague about the political future, saying that
he likes what he's doing, sees it as an opportunity for Republicans
to demonstrate that they care about the cities and the poor and can
improve the lot of both.
   Kemp waves off the observation that the Republican
administration wants to spend less, not more, on the construction
of housing for the poor. He says that's not the way to do it, that
tax and other incentives will spur private investment while the
prospect of owning their homes will help the poor break out of the
welfare and project housing cycle.
   It's the same supply-side theory Kemp advanced as the House
sponsor of the tax cut that eventually became the centerpiece of
Reaganomics. Now he argues for President Bush's proposal to cut the
capital gains tax rate, saying it will benefit low income Americans
by creating jobs and opportunities, and for the enterprise zone
plan he pushed as a member of Congress.
   That program would waive the capital gains tax altogether, and
provide other tax breaks to attract investment into economically
blighted districts.
   Critics call it trickle-down Republican economics. Kemp told
Congress it would open a Niagara Falls of economic growth in
depressed neighborhoods. And he tells Republicans that if they show
a real and lasting commitment to dealing with the problems of
low-income Americans, theirs will become the majority party.
   Kemp is pushing that mission, and not quietly. He says he wants
this administration to wage war on poverty, with different methods
but about the same goals as the one attempted by Lyndon B. Johnson.
That slogan isn't popular with everyone around the Cabinet table,
but Kemp isn't deterred.
   ``I try to be pithy in my advice,'' he says, smiling.
   Kemp is not in a job he sought, but now that he has it, he tells
audiences he was born for it. His first choice, of course, would
have been the presidency. He sought the 1988 Republican nomination
with conservative backing, but limped in the primaries and quit the
race early. He was on the list of vice presidential prospects, and
would have relished the nomination Dan Quayle got. In the Cabinet
he would have preferred Treasury.
   But HUD is working out. For all the headaches that go with the
earlier ethics and influence scandals, those problems made it an
agency in need of change, reform and repair, and that makes Kemp's
role more visible.
   While he won't speculate on a possible next step, Kemp said ``it
is no secret'' that he would not want to stay at the department
through eight years of a Bush administration. Then he quickly adds
that ``I want to stay on the team,'' for as long as the president
wants him.
   Kemp says he's a team player, part of what he describes as the
outer circle of the Bush administration. ``I don't expect to be on
the inner circle,'' he said. The real insiders were with Bush
before his nomination; in those days Kemp was an opponent.
   He said he harbors no thoughts about running for president again
_ an obligatory disclaimer for a political figure in his situation.
   ``I've had three great careers,'' said Kemp, 54, a professional
football quarterback, then a nine-term New York congressman before
he joined the Bush Cabinet. ``I have absolutely no thoughts of '96.
   ``I'll be 61 or 62,'' he said. ``I'll be too old.''
   Bush was 64 when he was inaugurated.

   It may be true that it never rains on investors
in money market mutual funds. But every now and then in money-fund
land the rumble of distant thunder can be heard.
   That message was driven home afresh a few days ago with the news
that a prominent firm that manages a group of funds had dipped into
its own pocket to protect its money fund against the threat of a
loss.
   T. Rowe Price Associates of Baltimore, which runs a $28
billion-plus stable of investments that includes 30 mutual funds,
said it had bought $64.6 million in securities of Mortgage &amp; Realty
Trust from portfolios it manages.
   The market price of M&amp;RT's commercial paper, or short-term IOUs,
appeared ready to suffer a drop after the real estate investment
trust filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy law.
   Though T. Rowe Price said it hopes and expects M&amp;RT eventually
to pay everything it owes on the paper, the firm acted to stave off
even the possibility of a small and temporary dip in the net asset
value of its Prime Reserve Fund and unspecified other pools of
money.
   Price wasn't the only fund manager caught in that bind. Erick
Kanter, a spokesman for the Investment Company Institute, a trade
group, said there were ``about half a dozen'' in all, but declined
to identify any of the others.
   In no case, apparently, did money fund shareholders lose any
money, since the fund sponsors followed a precedent that is fast
becoming the customary practice in cases like this.
   When a fund is sitting on an investment that is losing market
value because of a drop in the issuer's credit standing, it can be
made whole through the sale of that security to the separate
entity, with different owners, that sponsors the fund.
   Still, the fact remains that fund managers typically are under
no legal obligation to do this, and conceivably could find
themselves unable to take such action in some future instance
involving large, multiple defaults.
   Money funds, however safe their records may be, remain
securities subject to at least theoretical risks, without any
backing from federal deposit insurance or any other government
guarantee.
   But that basic disclaimer doesn't answer the question of what
further responsibilities, if any, should fall on the industry as in
continues the growth that has brought it nearly $400 billion in
assets in just two decades of existence.
   Right now, the chief response of many fund advisers seems to
have been to upgrade the safety of their holdings _ especially in
commercial paper, where they are already forbidden to venture
beyond issuers with high credit ratings.
   From the point of view of money-fund investors, and of a
financial system in which the funds play an increasingly important
role, is that enough?
   Even the highest rating is no absolute assurance of safety in an
investment like commercial paper, which normally is not secured by
any particular asset of the corporation that issues it.
   Says James Grant, financial newsletter publisher and frequent
critic of many credit practices of recent years: ``Now that the
corporate credit risk has been positively identified in the
junk-bond market, perhaps it is time to look somewhere else for
it.''
   At the same time, officials in the industry dismiss recurrent
conjecture that they might have set up or be planning to create
some unpublicized rainy-day reserve to help cope with any future
crisis.
   Perhaps some day money funds will have a backup system analagous
to deposit insurance in banking. But it could prove a painful error
for investors to suppose that any such thing exists today.

<HEAD>Goodbye '60s. Hello '90s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corporate management is maturing, and it
probably means a more competitive industrial America in the 1990s.
``It is very good news,'' says Professor Eugene Jennings.
   Jennings' assessment is based on research of corporate and
managerial data, an endeavor now into its fifth decade, making it
the longest existing and continuing study of business by the same
researcher.
   It began in the 1950s with the curiosity of a young man seeking
to make his mark in university circles. It continues with the same
intensity, but the man is now a professor emeritus, adviser to
corporate chairmen and a prolific author.
   In writing the manuscript for a new book, to be called
``Chiefs,'' Jennings, professor emeritus of management at Michigan
State University's graduate school of business, found that American
corporate management now blends some of the best of the new ideas
with those proven in the past.
   It leads him to conclude: ``Industrial America is probably
better positioned for competition now than ever before, judging
from the qualities of chiefs selected in the past decade.''
   The comparisons of various measurements of corporate chiefs are
consistent, each tending to support the other.
   First, Jennings compared the ratios of what he calls natives and
immigrants. In his lexicon, a native is a chief who grew up within
the company, and an immigrant is one appointed from outside the
business.
   In pre-1960s days corporations were inflexible. Chiefs almost
always were named from within the company. In the 1960s the ratio
became 50-50, meaning just as many were brought into the company as
were nurtured within.
   In the 1980s, however, the ratios shifted back to a middle
position. Now, three times as many chief executives are appointed
from within as from without. It indicates, says Jennings, that
boards are being more selective in their search for the best. No
longer are they blind to the possibilities of outsiders, but they
also recognize the importance of promoting from within.
   He made another comparison. In pre-1960s, there was no such
thing as an early arrival, or a person appointed chief executive at
age 49 or younger. In the 1960s, 40 percent were early arrivals.
Now, it is down to 25 percent.
   The blend of old and new continues in another test. In the
pre-watershed days of the 1960s, so-called late arrivals, age 58 or
older, made up 30 percent of appointments. In the 1960s, late
arrivals dropped out of sight. Companies wanted young blood. But in
the 1980s the percentage rose to 21 percent.
   At this point, says Jennings, some people might think of the
1960s as irresponsible. At any rate, he said, they had very poor
screening of the top executives. The anti-establishment attitude,
it seems, rose to the very top.
   A fourth test underscored the consistency of old to new to
middle ground.
   In pre-watershed days almost nobody was named chief executive
who didn't have his hands on the product, such as in sales and
manufacturing. These people are often said to have on-line
experience.
   In the 1960s, that old way changed. More than 50 percent were
named who had no hands on experience. But in the 1980s, screening
committees rediscovered the old ways. The percentage without hands
on experience dropped to 27 percent.
   Still another test showed similar results. Migrant chiefs, or
chairmen appointed from outside, were uncommon before the 1960s.
But all, at least, had experience within the industry.
   In the 1960s, however, only a slim majority of those named chief
had experience within the same industry. But that too changed; in
the 1980s, the vast majority of migrants had experience within the
particular industry.
   Same trend with another test, this one age. Before the 1960s, it
took 33 years to produce a chief. In the decade of the 1960s it
took only 21.5 years. Then in the 1980s, it rose to 26 years, as
industry opted for more experience.
   To Jennings it means that today American industry wants, and is
getting, seasoned and sure-footed executives, preferring them to
``the younger, vital, exhuberant types.''
   In a sense, he says, screening committees are seeking better
corporate health, just as all America does when it seeks better
nutrition and care in handling drugs and artery-clogging foods.
   Business is choosing good blood over fresh blood, he says.
Industry, he says, is getting a ``better balance of proteins and
carbohydrates rather than fresh blood hyped with vitamins.''

<TEXT>
   The United Nations had a major success
in guiding this vast, arid land to independence from South Africa
and learned important lessons for future operations in troubled
aear-long effort was one of the world organizatioreas.
   The yn's largest
and most expensive. The U.N. mission overcame several crises that
threatened to derail independence for Namibia after 75 years of
South African rule.
   As the United Nations withdraws, it is being praised by Namibia
and other countries. Local residents gave farewell parties for the
personnel of U.N. offices around the new country, sometimes
slaughtering sheep and oxen for the occasion.
   ``UNTAG will forever be remembered by our people,'' Foreign
Minisy matters dealt with by field workers had nothing to do with
independence.
   ``The local UNTAG stations became a place to bring one's
problems,'' Eckhard said. ``People even sought help for marital
disputes.''
   South Africa threatened to cancel the elections days before the
scheduled date in November, claiming U.N. radio traffic was
reporting an infiltration by SWAPO guerrillas. South Africa
withdrew the allegations, but suspicions remained.
   Seven political parties, led by SWAPO, won constituent assembly
seats in an election that attracted 97 percent of the eligible
voters.
   ``We effectively trained hundreds (of U.N. personnel) for
politically delicate field missions and learned quite a lot about
how to respond in tense situations,'' Eckhard said.
   The U.N. took over social services that had been provided by
Namibia's territorial army, he said, such as health care, teaching
school and delivering food to remote villages.
   He said the Namibia operation was being reviewed and future
election-monitoring operations probably would be run largely by
policemen and civilians, with fewer soldiers.
   Five hundred policemen and 4,650 soldiers were in the original
U.N. contingent for Namibia, but 1,000 more police were sent when
it became evident they were best equipped to monitor elections,
Eckhard said.
   By the time Independence Day arrived March 21, political parties
had unanimously agreed to a democratic constitution and joined a
call for national reconciliation after 23 years of war.
   ``I would like to make this country a kind of a model of what
all African countries, all developing countries, should be,'' U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said at the independence
celebrations.
   The Namibian operation cost $373 million, $40 million below the
budget estimate.

<HEAD>Two African Leaders Pledge to Keep One-Party Systems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN EDLIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The tide of democracy sweeping Eastern
Europe is being felt in black Africa, but one-party rule still
predominates and three of the major states have publicly committed
themselves to it.
   Tanzania has had only one party for 26 years and said this month
the policy will not change. Kenya did the same and Zimbabwe's
leader, Robert Mugabe, declared his intention to install one-party
rule.
   ``If we have many political parties, we will have chaos as
different tribes rush to form theirs,'' President Daniel arap Moi
of Kenya told trainee teachers at Laikipia in central Kenya.
``Tribal inclinations and consciousness is still paramount in the
minds of many Kenyans.''
   ``For now, I say no to the multiparty system, at least until we
are cohesive enough as a nation,'' he said.
   Kenya has 40 tribes in a population of 22 million. Ethnic
feuding is common in Parliament, at public rallies and in the press.
   Moi, a 66-year-old a former teacher from the minority Kalenjin
tribe, inherited the one-party system in 1978 from the late
President Jomo Kenyatta, the nation's founder. Kenyatta had banned
opposition parties nine years earlier.
   Kenyatta created a de facto one-party state by locking up his
political opponents. Moi made it constitutional in 1982.
   The president's statement was his first on the subject since
some other African states began considering more liberalized
political systems this year.
   He spoke after weeks of debate in Nairobi newspapers about
whether Kenya should restore the style of democracy bequeathed to
Kenyatta when he led the former British colony to independence in
1963.
   Writers supporting the status quo argued that Kenya had
prospered under the current system, without tribal strife. They
said a return to the old order might cause ethnic violence and
drive away tourists and investors.
   Those who wanted change said Kenyans were politically mature
enough for competition, that recent reforms in eastern Europe
should be used as an example and that a parliamentary opposition
would help check official corruption, mismanagement and nepotism.
   Neighboring Tanzania, a nation of 100 tribes, also was a British
colony until independence in 1961 under Julius Nyerere.
   Unlike its wealthy capitalist cousin, Tanzania followed
socialism based on Eastern European models. Both Nyerere and Ali
Hassan Mwinyi, who succeeded him as president in 1985, have
admitted the policies were flawed.
   Mwinyi, 65, has adopted radical economic reforms prescribed by
Western lenders, but has rejected suggestions that they be
accompanied by political change.
   ``While a multiparty system would be suitable for Europeans, it
might not be the same with Tanzania,'' Mwinyi told reporters in Dar
es Salaam.
   ``What Africans want is a fair return for their sweat through a
new international economic order. ... This cannot be solved by the
creation of 100 parties, which can bring chaos instead of
progress.''
   He said Tanzanians had voted consistently for a single party as
a way to guarantee national unity. He did not mention a statement
Nyerere made in February that multiparty democracy now may be
possible.
   Nyerere, still chairman of the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi Party,
remains a powerful political figure five years after he resigned as
president.
   Only a few of the 50 member nations of the Organization of
African Unity have Western-style democracies.
   Zimbabwe is one, but President Robert Mugabe declared after an
overwhelming victory in recent national elections that he will
transform the former British colony of Rhodesia into a one-party
state.
   Mugabe, who led Zimbabwe to independence 10 years ago, said the
elections were a mandate from the 4.8 million registered voters to
get rid of the opposition.
   His opponents accused Mugabe, 66, of seeking a dictatorship.
They noted that only 54 percent of the electorate voted and
opposition parties got 20 percent of the votes, although they won
only three of the 150 Parliament seats.
   Benin, a former French colony, is pledged to eliminate one-party
rule, Gabon is debating the question and there is pressure in the
Ivory Coast for a freer political order.
   Cameroon and Niger, scenes of recent political upheavals, have
rejected multiparty politics.
   Significant signals of change are coming from unlikely quarters.
   Ethiopia and Mozambique have abandoned their hardline Marxist
ideologies, and the Marxist leaders of Angola have committed
themselves to peace talks with U.S.-backed guerrillas that, if
fruitful, could lead to open elections.

   When the lawsuit began, Sophie and Milos
Malesev's daughter was in high school. When it ended, their
daughter's youngest son was in high school, and Milos had been dead
for 17 years.
   ``I thought they were waiting for me to die,'' said Mrs.
Malesev, who waited nearly 25 years to settle claims over damage
her house sustained when a water tunnel was built through her
neighborhood.
   Large urban courts typically are backlogged, but Wayne County
Circuit Court's civil system was branded as among the nation's
most-stalled in 1978 and 1984 studies by the National Center for
State Courts.
   Now, four years into a makeover that included a new computer
system and method of assigning cases to judges, the court is being
hailed as a model.
   ``We had a lousy case-flow management system. It placed total
responsibility everywhere and individual responsibility nowhere.
And as you see in the collapse of the communist world, that doesn't
work well,'' said Richard Kaufman, chief judge since 1986.
   Judges' impatience with delays and embarrassment over the low
ranking in the two studies spurred the changes.
   Per-judge caseloads have been whittled from 1,900 to 1,400.
Nineteen of the court's 35 judges are handling fewer than 700 cases
each, and 15 of those carry fewer than 600 each.
   On Jan. 1, 1986, the court had about 60,000 pending cases, of
which 17,000 were ``old dogs'' _ more than 2 years old. Now just
are 29,000 pending, including 2,700 old dogs.
   ``It's certainly a major triumph,'' said Ken Pankey of the
National Center for State Courts.
   ``Wayne County is the major success story,'' said Barry Mahoney
of the Denver-based Institute for Court Management, a branch of the
National Center for State Courts in Williamsburg, Va.
   Mahoney is planning a workshop for managers from other courts in
Detroit next year to show off what Wayne County has done.
   One problem with the old system was paperwork. With more than
100 cases filed daily, it was hard for keypunch operators to keep
up, said Terry Kuykendall, a deputy administrator. The first change
was a new computer system and a review of existing cases.
   Another help was the Michigan Supreme Court's coincidental
adoption of a rule that required discovery _ the pretrial gathering
of information about a case _ to be completed in 12 months instead
of 26.
   The most important change, how cases were handled, evolved after
long planning sessions with judges, staff, consultants and experts
from the American Bar Association and National Center. Until 1986,
incoming cases were assigned to one judge for pretrial matters and
transferred to another for trial.
   Under the individual docket, cases are assigned to one judge
from the moment they're filed. Hearings and other deadlines are
scheduled automatically, and the judge retains responsibility for
every phase of the case.
   Kaufman picked seven judges to go on the new calendar in October
1986. It worked. Every October since, seven more judges have gone
to the new system.
   Judge Marianne Battani was in the first group.
   She hears her own pretrial motions and sets her own trial dates.
Cases that waited three years under the old system now are finished
in 12 to 18 months, she said.
   ``I love it,'' Battani said.
   However, she wonders if it will become tempting to push cases to
settle out of court r transfer to another jurisdiction to get them
off the books.
   ``I think sometimes we get bogged down with statistics,'' she
said. ``I think there's an urge to handle cases quickly, because of
numbers.''
   Gerald Thurswell, a Detroit lawyer for 22 years, remembers how
under the old system, he sometimes pleaded for an accelerated trial
date for fear his client would die before the case came up. Judges
rarely granted such requests.
   ``There were so many excuses to get a fast trial. Clients used
to wait years,'' he said.
   Under the new system, lawyers in his firm are handling fewer
cases at one time because of the quickened pace.
   ``We've had to hire more attorneys,'' Thurswell said. ``They
move so fast; judges are in competition with each other. It's
better for the whole system.''
   ``It's good,'' said Chris Andreoff, another attorney. ``The
advantage is you know where you'll be. The judges have more grasp
because of the continuity.''
   Detroit court officials now are hoping to meet, within a few
years, ABA processing-time standards that call for 90 percent of
all civil cases to be completed in a year, 98 percent to be cleared
up within 18 months and 100 percent within two years.
   Currently, no urban court meets that standard, although a few
come close, said Doug Somerlot of the ABA's Lawyers Conference Task
Force on the Reduction of Litigation Cost and Delay. Nationwide
figures on civil delays don't exist because states use different
data, making comparisons impossible, he said.
   The National Center is studying whether the Wayne County project
can be applied to other courts, Pankey said.
   Somerlot said persistence might be the key to Wayne County's
reform.
   The most important thing, he said, is ``that they agreed it was
a problem and worked on it.''

<HEAD>AFTER THE COLD WAR: Backers Push for Smaller Scale Star Wars</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: This is one in an occasional series looking at how the U.S.
military is responding to the changes in the Soviet bloc.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the dim light of a super-secure
command bunker, Army Lt. Col. John W. Wilson paced, chin on chest,
listening to an intelligence report on a Soviet submarine off the
California coast.
   An instant later, as he glanced up at an illuminated global
``chessboard'' of U.S. and Sviet military forces, Wilson stopped
short. A voice near him cried, ``BSTS alert.'' An early-warning
satellite was signaling the launch of a nuclear missile.
   Wilson had the comfort of knowing this was only a ``war game''
simulation, but voices in the control center carried a serious tone
from the moment a U.S. surveillance plane over the Pacific reported
spotting a missile booster surging toward the surface.
   For Wilson, it was time to start thinking about doomsday and how
to escape.
   He sent word to the White House: ``We have a detected launch off
the West Coast.''
   Then, nearly as abruptly as the ``attack'' had begun, it was
over. Minutes after the count of incoming Soviet missiles reached
15, and before the warheads could hit their targets in the
southwestern United States, all were destroyed in a space- and
land-based rocket barrage orchestrated from Wilson's bunker.
   The ``crisis'' was a computer-simulated nuclear attack. It was
not the all-out assault that America has spent trillions of dollars
trying to deter throughout the Cold War, but a small-scale launch
by a rogue Soviet submarine commander.
   The scenario, played out for reporters recently at the Army's
Strategic Defense Command, dramatizes the new rationale being
promoted by the Bush administration for investing billions in a
Star Wars missile defense at a time when even the Pentagon
acknowledges that the threat of World War III is the lowest in 40
years.
   Instead of the impregnable, worldwide shield against a massive
wave of Soviet missiles _ as originally envisioned by Ronald Reagan
seven years ago _ promoters of the Strategic Defense Initiative say
a more modest defense is needed, one that still would put weapons
in space at a cost of about $55 billion but would be capable of
knocking out only half of the Soviets' main intercontinental
ballistic missile force.
   The new rationale also stresses a need to protect against an
accidental or unauthorized Soviet launch or a limited missile
attack by a Third World country.
   Gone is Reagan's talk of making nuclear weapons ``impotent and
obsolete.'' The aim now is to improve the traditional role of
offensive nuclear forces as a deterrent to war by making the odds
of a successful first strike even more uncertain.
   Gone, at least for the remainder of this century, are ideas of
using exotic and futuristic weaponry, such as the X-ray laser and
particle beam weapon, that originally gave SDI the Star Wars
nickname. The new emphasis is on more down-to-earth, rapidly
maturing technology such as kinetic-energy warheads that ``kill''
their targets in space by ramming them at high speed.
   Gone, too, is much of the interest in Congress for financing the
project. Last year, for the first time, the SDI budget was lower
than in the year before. Today it's an easy target of politicians
looking to harvest a post-Cold War ``peace dividend.''
   ``SDI is public enemy No. 1 on Capitol Hill,'' Sen. John Warner,
R-Va., said recently.
   Says Rep. Charles Bennett, D-Fla., who supports a scaled-down
SDI research budget but not deployment: ``Congress hasn't voted to
produce it and probably never will.''
   Bush has told the Pentagon he wants to be able to decide by 1992
whether to deploy a Star Wars defense, but he probably won't get
the chance by then. Officials and scientists working on the project
say they'll need a healthy increase in funds _ well above what
Congress seems likely to grant _ next year and in 1992 to lay a
sound technical foundation on which Bush could base his decision.
   Lt. Gen. Robert D. Hammond, commander of the Strategic Defense
Command that handles about one-third of the Star Wars research,
told reporters recently that he believed Bush could meet his target
date for a deployment decision ``only if you have good growth'' in
financing beyond the $3.8 billion authorized for this year.
   Bush has requested a $1 billion increase for next year, but it
appears unlikely he'll get anything close to that. He and the
Pentagon may have to live with less.
   From the start, more than seven years and $19 billion ago, the
project was designed as a long-term effort, with little prospect
for payoff before the turn of the century. But political pressure
to show results grew as policymakers wondered: Can it work? Is it
affordable? Will the Soviets find a way around it?
   All three are still open questions.
   The main pieces of a Star Wars system, as currently envisioned,
are sensors to detect and track enemy missiles from their launch
silos; land- and space-based rockets to attack the missiles in
flight, and computers to manage the battle.
   Of those three elements, the computer technology is perhaps the
most problematic.
   At the Strategic Defense Command in Hunstville, where Wilson and
his team of specialists test their responses to simulated nuclear
attacks, engineers are still experimenting with computer programs
that would be used to orchestrate a Star Wars response to a real
attack.
   Lawrence Tubbs, acting chief of battle management at the
Strategic Defense Command, said the key questions about the
computer software are: Can it be adequately tested, and would it
work?
   Some scientists say the answer to both is no.
   ``The problem of developing trustworthy software for the SDI is
not a problem that will be solved in our lifetimes or those of our
children,'' the Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility
wrote in an open letter to Congress on Feb. 16.
   The scientists group urged the abandonment of SDI, arguing that
a single error in the system's software could cause a complete
system failure under unpredictable circumstances.
   It appears unlikely Star Wars will be killed any time soon, if
only because of its economic lure. About 28,000 people are working
on the project at defense contractors, national laboratories,
universities and military installations in every state in the
nation and in five foreign countries.
   Two aerospace companies, Boeing Co. and Lockheed Corp., together
have taken in $2.2 billion in Star Wars contracts over the life of
the program, according to Pentagon figures. That is more than 10
percent of all Star Wars spending. Altogether, more than 1,000
military contractors have a piece of Star Wars action.
   The project's supporters say the American public will support
more research if they get the message that the goal of ballistic
missile defense is attainable.
   Lt. Gen. George Monahan, director of the SDI project,
acknowledged in testimony to a House panel April 4 that much more
work was needed to put the Star War pieces together, but he said
many scientific question marks have been erased.
   ``There is no doubt in my mind that the technology is here,
sufficient to develop and deploy such a system,'' he said.

   Months later, sheriff's deputy Bill Beard
could recall nothing unusual about his chance meeting with Bruce
Parker that gray Sunday morning.
   The two friends shared coffee and conversation at Dauna's Store,
a favorite gathering spot in this tiny Hill Country community, and
Parker seemed in high spirits.
   Beard knew of Parker's problems with members of his family and
that his friend had returned only recently to rejoin the ranching
clan.
   Like everyone else in town, Beard also knew the rumors of ``bad
blood'' among the Parkers, an imposing family tracing its ancestry
back to the Alamo.
   And finally, he knew only too well the family's history of
violence.
   Before nightfall that Sunday last autumn, Parker, 42, lay
mortally wounded on a bluff overlooking Big Rock, a scenic and
secluded area along the Little Devil's River in the heart of Parker
ranchland.
   In just six incredible months, three Parkers were dead _ and a
fourth was charged with murder.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   To some, the Parker family seemed larger than life, proud and
private, linked by blood to Comanche Chief Quanah Parker and by
legend to bandit queen Bonnie Parker.
   And certainly they were, as one claimed, ``Old West, Big Ranch.''
   James Henry Parker arrived in the rolling, brittle woodlands of
the Texas Hill Country in the early 1870s, accompanied by his young
bride Matilda, a grandniece of Davy Crockett, a name as famous as
the Alamo itself.
   Soon, the couple's original 160-acre tract grew to 12,000 acres,
and Jim and Tildy produced 11 children, including a son named Jess,
who in 1913 married Lorena Milam, a relative of Ben Milam, another
history book hero.
   In the late 1930s, Jess, called ``Big Daddy,'' and Lorena, ``Big
Mama,'' moved into the remote family homesite, now known as ``Old
Ranch,'' and raised five children.
   The four boys _ Doyle, Cecil, Raymond and Aubrey _ chose to
ranch with their father, who set aside land for each. But even
then, life was not as harmonious as ``Big Daddy'' would have liked.
   Friends said the relationship between Doyle and Cecil was
severely strained, and everyone suspected the feud involved land.
   After Cecil Parker died in 1968, his widow and family, which
included Bruce and his two sisters, were all but banished from the
ranch. It was ``Big Daddy'' himself who reluctantly urged them to
leave ``before something bad happens,'' according to Bruce Parker's
elder son Bart, now 24.
   But at ``Big Daddy's'' death, the old man's will restored a
parcel of Parker land to his grandchildren, and Bruce returned with
a new wife and a new outlook on life.
   A carpenter by profession but a cowboy by preference, Bruce
Parker looked and lived the part of a man born and raised on a
sprawling Texas ranch.
   Handsome, hard-working and easygoing, Parker rarely dressed in
anything other than boots, jeans, western shirts and cowboy hats.
   Only 19 when his father died and his family was ousted, Bruce
bounced around the Hill Country working at an assortment of jobs.
But always he was drawn back to Kimble County.
   ``It wasn't that the land was so important, but this is where
his home was,'' said Linda, whose 1983 marriage to Bruce was the
second for them both. ``Being away was like a great big empty hole
in him.''
   In the fall of 1986, shortly after inheriting his ranchland,
Bruce guided Linda to a hilltop commanding a regal view of the
countryside below.
   Producing blueprints of a two-story house, he embraced her and
asked: ``How would you like a house like this built right here?''
   ``I remember telling him I would never love him as much as I did
at that moment,'' she said.
   Bruce himself built the house, a spacious country home
constructed in part with native rock, not unlike what his
great-grandfather used more than a century ago.
   Early one morning, as they sipped coffee and watched their
horses grazing below, Bruce told Linda he was never happier, but
still was troubled by something.
   ``I'm afraid somebody's going to come and take this away,'' she
recalled him saying.
   ``Nobody can take this away from you,'' she replied. ``It's
yours.''
   In both good times and bad, Linda said, Bruce was always very
proud to be a Parker.
   ``They are wonderful, honest, hard-working people ...,'' she
said. ``There is nothing superficial about them. They're either for
you or against you. There is no in-between.''
   And, she said, most were supportive after Bruce's death.
   On that fateful weekend last October, the couple attended a
Friday night football game at Harper High School, where Bruce once
played quarterback.
   Bruce spent much of the weekend working on his Uncle Raymond's
ranch, where he had leased the hunting and fishing rights. He drove
along Little Devil's River, where years ago the Parker clan
gathered under shade trees across from Big Rock.
   They would barbecue steers and goats at the river's edge and
sing and dance to live music, often until dawn.
   ``This was Bruce's favorite spot in the whole world,'' Linda
said.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The Parkers worked and played hard, and though they kept a low
profile, they seemed eerily doomed to uncommon and often violent
tragedy _ ``some real bad luck,'' according to Kimble County
Sheriff Pat Davis.
   One of ``Big Daddy's'' brothers and his wife died in a double
shooting in 1935. No motive ever was uncovered, but a note
indicated the couple formed a suicide pact.
   Five years later, Jim Parker's granddaughter was slain by her
husband, who cut her throat. And in 1962, one of Parker's
great-grandsons was shot and killed in a dispute over a girl he was
dating.
   But it was an episode last summer that set the tone for the most
recent violence.
   Jesse ``Jett'' Parker, another of ``Big Daddy's'' ill-fated
nephews, was gunned down on Parker ranchland June 10, an apparent
robbery victim.
   Investigators said a warrant was issued for a fugitive from
Mexico, but no arrest has been made.
   No one professes to know who or what lured Bruce Parker to the
bluff above Big Rock that Sunday last October.
   There was not a hint of trouble, Linda said, and if there had
been renewed friction between Bruce and any of his relatives, ``I
think we would have known it.''

   She last saw her husband alive down at the camphouse where he
was working that afternoon. When she returned from an errand, he
was gone.
   The phone call from ``Big Mama,'' the aging matriarch of the
Parker clan, came at dinnertime. Lorena Parker told her something
had happened to Bruce.
   A sizable crowd already had gathered atop the bluff when Linda
arrived. Her husband's lifeless body, face down in a pool of blood,
was sprawled along the dirt road on the driver's side of the pickup.
   Deputy Bill Beard, the first officer at the scene, spotted a
powder burn about the size of a half-dollar on his friend's chest.
He privately concluded that Bruce's death was a homicide.
   ``There were too many things that didn't add up to a
self-inflicted wound,'' Beard said.
   Bruce's western hat was on the hood of the truck, which Kimble
County Sheriff Pat Davis considered significant.
   ``They said when he was mad and about ready to fight, the first
thing he did was take his hat off and set it down,'' Davis said.
``It looks like there might be some sort of altercation.''
   Linda would not totally accept that premise, but never did she
embrace the theory her husband killed himself.
   The motive behind the slaying?
   ``Jealousy and greed,'' she snapped.
   Would she explain?
   ``No,'' she replied. ``All of this will come out in court.''
   An investigator, speaking despite a judicial gag order, may have
struck close to the truth.
   ``The family got larger and larger,'' he drawled, ``and the land
smaller and smaller.''

   In mid-November, a steady stream of Parkers clattered across the
bridge spanning the Llano River and rolled up to the old
brick-and-stone courthouse in Junction.
   For two days, they and others appeared before grand jurors to
answer questions about the events of Oct. 29.
   Among the witnesses subpoenaed were Doyle Parker, 75, and his
brother Raymond, 66, the uncle who owned the land where the
shooting occurred.
   Friends knew Doyle as a man with a fondness for cigars and a
dedication to ranching and family. He spent his entire life on
Parker land and had acquired holdings beyond what he inherited from
``Big Daddy.''
   Unlike Doyle, Raymond left the Parker conclave for San Antonio
and spent 17 years in business before returning to the ranch in his
later years.
   After hearing two days of testimony, grand jurors returned a
murder indictment accusing Doyle Parker of ``intentionally and
knowingly'' killing his nephew.
   He was arrested, but quickly freed on $25,000 bail. A trial date
is pending.
   Ron Sutton, the district attorney, calls his case
``circumstantial and complicated,'' but says he is eager to
prosecute despite Doyle Parker's advanced age.
   ``His mother's in good shape at 92 and his father lived to be
97,'' Sutton said. ``These people live forever down there unless
they get shot.''
   The frost-laden northers that usher in a Hill Country winter
were no match for the chill that penetrated the Parker compound in
the days following the indictment.
   According to investigators and others, ``Big Mama'' indirectly
blamed her son Raymond for Bruce's death. Even though Doyle stood
legally accused, authorities said she felt the tragedy occurred
because Raymond had granted his nephew hunting and fishing rights
to sacred Parker ground.
   Raymond said nothing, at least publicly.
   On a Sunday night in early December, he picked up his
.22-caliber automatic pistol and disappeared into the bathroom of
his ranch home. Without a word, or a note, he blew his brains out.
   He left behind only his grand jury testimony, secret by law.

<HEAD>Sandra Bullock Gets `Working Girl' Role She Heard About On TV</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sandra Bullock was visiting Los Angeles when
she heard on television that the NBC sitcom ``Working Girl'' was
seeking a new leading lady.
   She'd had only a few jobs as a New York-based actress, and was
hoping to find regular work in the larger market for performers
here.
   ``Nancy McKeon had just left the show and I heard on a news show
they were looking for someone,'' Bullock said. ``I knew a lot of
people who auditioned for it. They were seeing a bunch of people,
and my agent sent me. Finally, it got down to about five people,
and we went to the network. I think it was my begging that got me
the job.''
   ``Working Girl,'' a spring tryout series, is based on the hit
comedy movie starring Melanie Griffith, Harrison Ford and Sigourney
Weaver. Griffith was nominated for an Academy Award for her role as
Tess McGill, the character Bullock plays.
   Tess is a young secretary from Staten Island who becomes a
junior executive in Manhattan, and the series draws on contrasts
between her home life and life in the corporate world.
   It also stars George Newbern as a preppie co-worker, Nana
Visitor as her hard-driving boss, Tom O'Rourke as a self-made
corporate powerhouse, Edye Byrde as the seen-it-all ``temp,''
Anthony Tyler Quinn as a neighborhood Romeo, and Judy Prescott as
Tess' best friend from childhood.
   ``Tess is a very stubborn woman, but in a good way,'' Bullock
said. ``She's a little more daring in her choices than I am. She's
headstrong, but she would not sacrifice her beliefs or her family
to get ahead.
   ``In the first show, she's a secretary again. Then she has to
adjust to becoming a junior executive. She doesn't quite fit in and
her accent doesn't quite fit in.''
   The concept has undergone changes to adapt it from a movie to a
sitcom, and Tess' character has been altered somewhat since Melanie
Griffith is softer while Bullock has more of an edge.
   Nancy McKeon, formerly of ``The Facts of Life,'' had been set to
portray Tess, but left the show because of ``creative differences.''
   Before ``Working Girl,'' Bullock had worked mostly in small
films.
   ``I had a few lines in the ABC movie `The Preppie Murder,''' she
said. ``I was in `The Bionic Showdown' with Lee Majors and Lindsay
Wagner. In New York, I did a lot of small, independent films, the
kind you find through the trade papers.''
   Two of those movies that will be coming out are ``Who Shot
Patakango,'' about racial gang violence, and ``Religion Inc.,'' a
satire in which she plays a by-the-book lawyer.
   Bullock was born in Germany. Her mother was a German opera
singer, and her father was an American voice teacher who had been
in the U.S. Army there.
   ``Once in a while, I'd come down with one of my father's voice
students and hit high C,'' she said. ``I've never had a desire to
sing, I guess because my parents did it so well. I wanted to do
something else.
   ``I loved acting. I was a ham. I was good at goofing off. I
didn't know if I wanted to do acting permanently when I started in
college. But I did love goofing off because I was no good at math.''
   Bullock attended East Carolina University in Greenville, N.C.
   ``One of the first things I did out of college was `No Time
Flat,''' she said. ``They were looking for a Southern belle,
although I'm certainly not Southern. It's a comedy about a Vietnam
vet who looks up his old girlfriend and I answer the door. I'm her
daughter and I go along with him.''
   Bullock said she had a difficult time auditioning for roles in
New York because nobody could put a label on her.
   ``Nobody knew what to make of me,'' she said. ``I was too
offbeat. I auditioned for two soaps, but they said, `Where'd you
come from?' They were looking for the girl next door. I'd try to
put a little humor in it. `Ashley, I didn't know I had any
children!' I couldn't get a line like that out of my mouth without
laughing.''
   To pay bills, she worked as a bartender and cocktail waitress.
   ``I learned a lot of accents as a bartender,'' she said. ``A lot
of girls came in looking for rich husbands. I learned to imitate
them.''

   Sharp increases in clothing, housing and
medical costs contributed to a 0.5 percent leap in consumer prices
in March that pushed inflation to the highest level since 1982.
   Private economists said Tuesday the unexpectedly brisk advance
in the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index was a discouraging
sign that inflation was not retreating as they had hoped.
   Through the first three months of the year, inflation has risen
at an annual rate of 8.5 percent, the fastest quarterly increase
since a 10.1 percent increase in the spring of 1982.

   The nation's industrial production gained 0.7
percent in March, the government said.
   March's advance followed an even stronger 0.8 percent increase a
month earlier. Both gains reflected increases in the output of
automobiles, the Federal Reserve reported Tuesday.
   Production had plummeted 1.3 percent in January because of the
effect of the weather on utility output and of layoffs in the
automobile industry as automakers trimmed bloated inventories.

   The plan disclosed Tuesday calls for the bank eventually to cut
its assets to about $20 billion, compared with a current level of
$25 billion, and $32 billion last fall. The corporation also said
it would create a ``collecting bank'' to deal with a mountain of

<HEAD>Ex-Arbitrager Gets Four Months, $1 Million Fine</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   It was one of the most widely quoted one-liners
in Wall Street's insider trading scandal _ ``Your bunny has a good
nose'' _ but there was nothing funny about it for Robert Freeman.
   The former head of arbitrage for Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. was
ordered Tuesday to serve four months in prison and pay a $1 million
fine for trading securities after hearing the comment, which helped
him conclude that a takeover deal was in trouble.
   U.S. District Judge Pierre Leval said he imposed a prison term
to send a message to Wall Street that insider trading and other
white-collar crime cannot be treated lightly.
   ``These practices seriously undermine the integrity of the
marketplace,'' he said, later adding: ``It is perhaps one of the
consequences of enormous power and wealth that there are
downsides.''
   Leva sentenced Freeman to one year in prison but suspended the
last eight months of the term. The judge said he rejected a lengthy
term because Freeman was shown to be a good man who was chastened
by his crime. Freeman faced a maximum of five years.
   The sentence capped one of the longest and most contentious
episodes in the government's crackdown on insider trading stemming
from the confessions of former stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky.
   Freeman, 47, pleaded guilty last August to one count of mail
fraud for using illegally obtained inside information to trade
securities in connection with the proposed takeover of Beatrice
Cos. by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.
   He admitted getting information from former Kidder, Peabody &amp;
Co. investment banker Martin Siegel, who has pleaded guilty to two
counts and is awaiting sentencing. Kidder represented KKR in the
proposed takeover.
   The case turned on a comment made by Siegel after Freeman called
him on Jan. 8, 1986, to try to confirm rumors that the Beatrice
takeover was in jeopardy.
   Freeman told Siegel he had heard about problems in the deal from
a prominent New York Stock Exchange trader, Bernard ``Bunny''
Lasker. Siegel responded: ``Your bunny has a good nose,'' Freeman
said in an account of the episode.
   After taking the call, Freeman reduced Goldman's stake in
Beatrice. He admitted to a felony crime for the action but defense
lawyers said it did not merit prison. The government had requested
prison time.
   ``Mr. Freeman is a good man who made a mistake that he has
admitted, for which he has been punished extraordinarily,'' defense
attorney Paul Curran said, citing the ``agony that Mr. Freeman and
his family had to endure beginning with his arrest on false charges
three years ago.''
   Freeman was arrested in February 1987 along with two other Wall
Street executives on charges the U.S. Attorney's Office in
Manhattan called ``the tip of the iceberg.''
   But the government dropped the original indictments and last
year called off its investigation of the two others, Timothy Tabor
and Richard Wigton. Wigton was arrested on his trading floor and
hauled away in handcuffs. The nature of the arrests and their
disposition provoked outrage on Wall Street.
   Leval said the conversation with Siegel, who implicated Freeman
after he was linked to insider trading by Boesky, was illegal and
deserved prison.
   ``Although the answer was couched in veiled language, it
constituted the illegal transaction of inside information,'' Leval
said. ``...There is no question he knew full well he was breaking
the law.''
   The $1 million fine was about twice the trading loss avoided by
Goldman, Freeman and his clients by selling the Beatrice holdings,
the maximum penalty under the law, Leval said. Freeman has 30 days
to pay.
   Freeman, who lives in the New York suburb of Rye, also was
placed on two years' probation and ordered to serve 300 hours of
community service. Freeman asked to serve his sentence in a
minimum-security prison camp in Pensacola, Fla. He must surrender
to the government June 19.

<HEAD>Merc Members Approve Dual Trading Restrictions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange hopes its newly
proposed curbs on dual-trading will convince federal regulators to
stop considering more drastic bans.
   Members of the exchange voted Tuesday to approve a
management-backed plan to ban the controversial practice for
two-thirds of the Merc's trading volume.
   The Merc said 76 percent of the 1,561 ballots cast favored the
restrictions, which were drawn up by an exchange committee and
approved recently by board of governors. The exchange has 2,500
active members.
   Dual-trading is the long-standing practice of floor brokers
trading for their own accounts and for customers.
   A government probe of the Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade
zeroed in on dual-trading and other practices as key factors in
trader abuse.
   Despite the potential for abuse, the Merc and the Board of Trade
argue that dual-trading brings an added level of liquidity to the
market, helping guarantee that at any moment someone wanting to
sell or buy a contract will find someone with whom to do business.
   The proposal approved by Merc members would ban dual-trading in
contracts that have a proven record of liquidity.
   Contracts in which there isn't much business, usually those for
delivery in distant months, still would permit dual-trading.
   The lightly traded contracts also are more easily monitored for
abuses, said Merc spokesman Andrew Yemma.
   The Commoditiy Futures Trading Commission has proposed a trial
reform in which dual-trading would be banned for all delivery
months for one financial future and one agricultural commodity.
   The Merc said it will ask the CFTC to approve the exchange's
proposal in lieu of the agency's pilot program.
   The CFTC is expected to make a final determination late in the
summer.
   Congress also is considering dual-trading restrictions that
would be potentially more severe than those proposed by the Merc.
   The Merc's proposed restrictions were recommended by a committee
that reviewed trading practices in light of the government
investigation, in which 48 people, mostly traders, have been
indicted.
   Even before the investigation was revealed last year, the Merc
banned dual-trading in 1987 for 90 percent of the trades in its
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock-index futures pit.
   ``There was a feeling among members in the pit that there were
abuses of dual-trading that needed to be addressed,'' said Yemma.
   The Board of Trade also believes the CFTC proposal goes too far,
said CBOT spokesman Michael O'Connell.
   There currently are no restrictions on dual-trading at the Board
of Trade, and officials there want to keep it that way, O'Connell
said. ``Dual-trading accounts for a great source of market
liquidity,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Bank of New England Corp. says it plans to make
the company smaller but stronger by stripping its troubled real
estate loans from its main banking business.
   The strategy, unveiled Tuesday, will create a separate
``collecting'' bank to deal with a mountain of troubled loans and
use advertising to allay depositor fears.
   The plan also calls for the bank to sell its Rhode Island and
Maine subsidiaries and eventually cut its assets to about $20
billion. Assets currently stand at $25 billion and were $32 billion
just last fall.
   Solving the bank's problems ``will require major financial and
business restructuring which, while challenging, will allow us to
rebuild a strong regional bank,'' Chairman Lawrence Fish said.
   Fish, who succeeded ousted chairman Walter J. Connolly last
month, said the company will focus on businesses including retail
and commercial banking, and real estate lending.
   ``We're going to keep it simple,'' Fish said in a statement.
``We're going to take deposits and we're going to make sound
loans.''
   The bank, which has been operating under government orders for
more than a month, lost more than $1 billion last year. It recently
announced plans to cut 5,600 workers, or one-third of the payroll,
through a combination of layoffs, attrition and the sale of assets.
   Much of the bank's trouble has been blamed on shaky construction
loans that were exposed during a downturn in the Northeast real
estate market. But analysts warn that the bank could face more
trouble as the New England economy continues to worsen,
deteriorating the bank's assets further.
   Some analysts had suggested that the bank separate the bad loans
from the rest of the assets in order to alleviate the burden from
the solid operations.
   The bank said Steven E. Wheeler, a former Morgan Stanley
executive, would serve as executive vice president and oversee the
new ``collecting'' bank.
   This operation will restructure the troubled real estate assets
and possibly offer them for sale, the bank said. Wheeler has
experience in the New England real estate market, having served as
president of First Winthrop Corp., a Boston-based real estate
syndication and investment firm.
   The bank also is trying to improve its capital levels and reduce
borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank. Part of the plan is to
use advertising campaigns to stem the fears of depositors, who have
pulled billions of dollars from the company.
   Bank of New England said it would adopt a ``new organizational
structure'' that would change management processes and emphasize
accountability.
   As part of its sale of assets, the bank also announced Tuesday
it had reached an agreement to sell all the securities activities
handled by its discount brokerage unit, New England Discount
Brokerage Inc., to Charles Schwab &amp; Co. Inc. for an undisclosed
cash price.

<HEAD>Nike Plans to Spend $5 Million to Place Public Service-Type Ads</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Nike Inc. plans to spend 17 percent of its $30
million basketball shoe advertising budget this year on public
service-type messages encouraging youngsters to stay in school.
   The campaign comes at a time when some critics have blamed
high-priced athletic shoes for triggering crime in poor urban
areas. Some children wearing the shoes have been attacked by other
youngsters who covet them as status symbols.
   ``We know people that are in our ads are role models and kids
pay a lot of attention to our ads,'' said Liz Dolan, a spokeswoman
for Nike. ``We felt this could be a real contribution that we could
make.''
   The Beaverton, Ore.-based athletic shoemaker said Tuesday it
plans to spend $5 million to buy time for these messages and will
run them along with its regular product ads so they won't be
consigned to the least-watched times.
   Nike's public service messages would feature pro basketball
stars Michael Jordan, who has appeared for his own line of Nike
shoes, and David Robinson, who is about to turn up in a new ad
campaign for Nike's Force line.
   Robinson, who plays center for the San Antonio Spurs, told a
news conference he thought it was unfair to single out the makers
of athletic shoes for causing crime.
   ``Kids are attacking kids over a lot of things, not just
shoes,'' he said.
   He said the new ads give him a chance to become a positive role
model for children who may not have one.
   Prices for the Force line of shoes run from $58 to $135 a pair
with the major share of sales coming in the least expensive shoes,
Ms. Dolan said.
   Nike brand marketing manager Ron Hill said the Force line
accounts for about 60 percent of Nike's $250 million a year in
basketball shoe sales.
   In the $15 million ad campaign for the line, which debuts in
late April on the NBA playoff telecasts, Robinson is the amiable
focal point in his own ``Mr. Robinson's Neighborhood,'' an apparent
takeoff on the children's public TV show ``Mister Rogers'
Neighborhood.''
   In one ad, Spurs Coach Larry Brown talks about the words for
that day, ``Transition Game.''
   Brown repeatedly admonishes Robinson to run back down the court
after the opponent misses a shot as clips of Robinson playing
basketball flash on the screen.
   ``I don't think we'll have Coach Brown on the show anymore,''
Robinson tells viewers as the commercial ends.
   Another ad in the series, called ``Kick Butt,'' is being held
until fall when the new inflatable Nike Force shoes are on the
market. The shoes have a built-in pump to inflate the collar around
the ankles; the shoes replace Nike's Air Pressure shoes that
required a separate pump.
   Nike's arch rival Reebok International sells a shoe called The
Pump that is inflated by pressing a marked spot on the tongue of
the shoe.
   In the ad, Robinson demonstrates how to tie them _ ``Mr.
Robinson likes double knots'' _ and to inflate them _ ``Mr.
Robinson likes six pumps.''
   ``Then Mr. Robinson likes to take his special Nike shoes onto
the court and kick some butt,'' the athlete says in an innocent
voice.
   ``Can you say `Kick some butt?''' he asks as the words flash on
the screen, interspersed with more shots of Robinson in action on
the basketball court.
   Ms. Dolan said Nike feels viewers will understand that Robinson
is talking about playing agressively, and doubts youngsters will
read more into it.
   ``I think everybody will get the joke,'' she said.

   United Telecommunications Inc. said it
will buy the remaining 19.9 percent of US Sprint and change its
name to Sprint Corp. to cash in on the high profile of the nation's
No. 3 long-distance carrier.
   United Telecom on Tuesday also reported a 41 percent rise in
first quarter profits, but it said revenue growth was slower than
expected at US Sprint and that competition was intensifying from
rivals AT&amp;T and MCI.
   US Sprint was formed in 1986 as a joint venture of United
Telecom and GTE Corp. and has grown to control 8 percent of the
long-distance market.
   United Telecom bought a controlling interest in 1988 and was
given an option to buy the remaining 19.9 percent.
   The company will notify GTE by the end of May that it is ready
to exercise the option and take full control, William Esrey,
chairman and CEO, told Telecom shareholders at Tuesday's annual
meeting in this Kansas City, Mo., suburb.
   The agreed selling price is about $500 million, Telecom
spokesman Jerry Cosley said.
   Esrey said United Telecom's name would change July 1, when the
transaction with GTE is expected to be completed. Shareholders
approved the name change at the meeting.
   ``It's obviously not without some mixed emotions,'' retiring
Chairman Paul Henson told shareholders. ``We think that Sprint
Corporation tells the financial community more clearly what we are
about. In addition, it has very high public recognition.''
   The company also will shorten the long-distance subsidiary's
name to Sprint, reflecting its attempts to expand overseas, Esrey
said. Telecom's local telephone service subsidiaries, such as
United Telephone of Kansas, will remain unchanged.
   Sprint's revenues were $1.2 billion in the first quarter vs.
$984 million in the same quarter last year, an increase of 22
percent. But revenues increased only about 2 percent from the last
quarter of 1989, less than the 4 percent to 6 percent forecast by
company officials, Cosley said.
   ``This is an area that we are somewhat disappointed in, and that
we are addressing,'' Esrey told stockholders.
   Cosley said some revenues from contracts already won by Sprint
simply did not materialize during the quarter as expected because
equipment wasn't installed. ``But those revenues will show up down
the road,'' he said.
   Esrey told shareholders Sprint will introduce about 55 new
products this year as competition in the long-distance market heats
up. He noted that both American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and MCI
Communications Inc. are developing fiber-optic telephone networks
similar to the one Sprint built a few years ago and now touts in
its advertising.
   ``Day-by-day, that advantage tends to shrink on us,'' Esrey
said. ``We must now use our system to help us develop new
products.''
   He said the company would consider buying smaller long-distance
companies as MCI did recently when it bought Telecom USA Inc. of
Atlanta, the fourth-largest U.S. long-distance carrier. But Esrey
said Telecom would proceed with caution.
   ``Certainly, if we can acquire customers by buying them, cheaper
than we can through other ways, we will do it,'' he said.
   United Telecom said it earned $107.6 million or 51 cents a share
on revenues of $2.02 billion in the first quarter, compared with
$76.4 million or 36 cents a share on revenues of 1.77 billion a
year earlier.
   The company's stock closed 25 cents lower at $39.87{ on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   Also at the meeting, Henson, who had announced his retirement
more than a year ago, officially stepped down after 31 years. He
came to the company in 1959 as a vice president, was named
president in 1964 and chairman in 1966. He is given much credit for
helping to form Sprint in the mid-1980s.

<HEAD>Domestic Vehicle Sales Drop 11 Percent in Early April</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Early April sales of North American-made vehicles
skidded 11.2 percent, and analysts say auto dealers may not get the
usual spring surge of buyers on their lots.
   ``While we think we've seen the worst, it's not clear when it's
going to get any better,'' said Steve Girsky, auto industry analyst
for PaineWebber Inc. ``We see it muddling along for another month
or so.''
   Chrysler Corp. on Tuesday reported the biggest decline, a
29.2-percent drop in car sales from levels of last April 1-10, when
the No. 3 automaker offered interest-free financing on some
vehicles.
   Ford Motor Co.'s car sales slid 20.7 percent and General Motors
Corp.'s were down 13.6 percent from the year-earlier period, the
companies said.
   Sales from Japanese-owned plants in this country continued to
grow, however.
   The latest figures were measured against a strong year-earlier
period, when sales rose more than 28 percent. Along with Chrysler's
interest-free loans, GM and Ford announced interest rates as low as
2.9 percent just before the early-April 1989 surge.
   This year, the Big Three have been offering various combinations
of rebates and low-interest incentives. The lowest rates currently
available are 6.9 percent on some GM vehicles and 2.9 percent on
some Ford and Chrysler models.
   But the incentives have lost impact, and with inventories
trimmed by first-quarter production cuts, the companies have little
reason to spend more money on them, said analyst Harvey Heinbach of
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Inc.
   ``We think that sales are going to remain at these levels for
some time,'' he said.
   ``Everybody's gotten used to the incentives. They ask `What's on
this month?''' said Len Gossman, sales manager at Blackwell Ford
Inc. in Plymouth.
   Gossman blamed his dealership's 10-percent drop partly on the
mid-April Easter holiday that had people planning vacations rather
than buying cars. The cold spring also repelled shoppers, he said.
   GM, Ford and Chrysler said their cars and light trucks sold at a
combined average daily rate of 29,832 in the April 1-10 period,
down 14.6 percent from a rate of 34,931 vehicles a day in early
April 1989.
   Total U.S. sales of North American-made cars were down 13.3
percent and light truck sales slid 7.5 percent.
   All but one of the eight Japanese companies that make vehicles
in this country reported stronger sales in early April. American
Honda, the biggest, maker, said sales were up 17 percent at 9,455
cars. Toyota USA and Mazda USA, which are gearing up production
from a lower base, doubled and tripled their sales, respectively.
   Nissan USA's car sales fell 6 percent in early April, but its
light truck sales were up 14.2 percent.
   For the year to date, U.S. sales of North American-made cars are
down 2.4 percent and light truck sales are off 0.4 percent from
last year. Combined domestic car and light truck sales are down 1.7
percent for the year so far.
   GM said its light truck sales edged up 2.2 percent for early
April. For the year, the No. 1 automaker said car sales were down 4
percent, while light truck sales were up 3.8 percent.
   Ford said its early April light truck sales sagged 9.3 percent.
Ford said car sales were down 10 percent and light truck sales were
down 3.5 percent for the year.
   Chrysler reported a 24.9 percent drop in early April light truck
sales. For the year, Chrysler said its car sales were down 14
percent and light truck sales were down 1.5 percent.

<HEAD>Comptroller Approves Mobile Branch Bank for Rural Tennessee County</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Like many people in rural America, David
Armour has trouble doing his banking.
   ``It's 15 miles from my office to the bank,'' said Armour, sales
manager at a Ford dealership in the heart of West Tennessee's
rolling farm country.
   ``If something comes up and I can't get loose, it's tomorrow
before I can deposit my check,'' he said.
   Starting next month, the bank will come to Armour and other
rural residents of Madison County. That's when the First National
Bank of Jackson's mobile bank _ a converted armored car,
appropriately enough _ hits the roads.
   The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency notified the bank
on Monday that it had approved its request for a mobile branch.
   The new rolling branch office will have two teller windows in
its side. Customers will be able to cash checks, make deposits and
buy certificates of deposit from the tellers, who will park the
truck at grocery stores, truck stops and other gathering spots.
   ``It's gonna be great,'' Armour said. ``They're saying they
might pull in here once a week and let the mechanics and salesmen
deposit their checks.''
   Eventually, First National Bank president Ernest Vickers III
said, customers will be able to apply for loans or a mortgage or
drop off valuables for their safe deposit box. Those plans may
require a converted motor home, though, he said.
   ``We felt there was a large segment of county that is not
adequately served by traditional banking,'' Vickers said.
   ``I figured if Federal Express can come to your door, who are we
as banks to tell customers, `You've got to come to us.'''
   Vickers says the idea was born more from his marketing and sales
background than his 14 years of banking experience. But he says
service is the name of the game, whatever the industry.
   Many agree.
   ``It sounds like a real good idea to me,'' said Nathan Pride, a
Madison County attorney and spokesman for the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People in Jackson.
   ``I've talked to people who have trouble getting into the bank
and they said they'd like it if it would come to their neighborhood
just once a week,'' he said.
   Whether Vickers and First National can meet the county's demands
is another matter. Vickers says the rolling bank's schedule is
being worked out.
   Moveable bank branches have been approved before, said J.
Michael Shepherd, senior deputy comptroller for the Officer of the
Comptroller of the Currency in Washington.
   ``But Mr. Vickers' plan is quite rare,'' he said. ``I approved
one in Arizona that was used at concerts, football games and big
events. It was kind of a rolling automatic teller machine.''
   Shepherd said Vickers' plan was laudable because it would
provide a banking service to people who otherwise must drive long
distances to make a deposit.
   Approving the bank's plan was easy once the comptroller's office
determined Tennessee law was silent on the question of banks on
wheels.
   Industry analyst Henry Coffee of J.C. Bradford Co. in Nashville
applauded the move.
   ``Anything that brings in more deposits at a lower marginal cost
is positive,'' he said. ``It sounds like this will be cheaper than
building a branch.''

<HEAD>Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Division Settles with SEC</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp.
agreed to pay back $5.6 million to customers for stock sold in
partial tender offers without prior client approval, federal
officials said.
   The New York-based securities firm and a managing director,
Michael Dreitlein, agreed to settle _ without admitting or denying
wrongdoing _ an administrative action alleging they violated
Securities and Exchange Commission anti-fraud and record-keeping
rules. The settlement was disclosed Tuesday.
   The action, brought by the SEC's New York Regional Office,
accused Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette's Pershing Division of making
$4.3 million in tender offer profits from the ``unauthorized and
undisclosed'' sale of shares from customer accounts.
   A tender offer is an offer to buy a corporation's shares _ often
as a means of acquiring the concern _ usually at a premium price.
   According to the SEC, the Pershing Division, then-headed by
Dreitlein, tendered shares belonging to customers who had not given
any instructions to do so. The shares were later replaced, usually
with stock bought at a lower price after the tender offer. DLJ kept
any profits from the difference between the sale and repurchase
price.
   The alleged activity, known as overtendering, took place between
January 1982 and April 1988, the SEC said.
   ``Securities transactions are predicated on trust. DLJ misued
that trust when it confiscated customers' securities for its
benefit,'' said Martin A. Kuperberg, the SEC's associate regional
administrator in New York.
   Kathryn Ashbaugh, broker-dealer enforcement branch chief in New
York, explained that while the misappropriated securities were
replaced with no quantifiable loss to customers, the increased
number of shares DLJ sold in 104 partial tender offers effectively
dilluted the number shareholders could sell to the acquiring
company.
   In a partial tender offer, the acquirer isn't seeking 100
percent of the corporation's stock, and therefore not every
shareholder can sell stock.
   As part of the settlement with the SEC, DLJ agreed to pay $4.3
million plus interest for a total of $5.6 million to customers
whose shares were used in the overtendering.
   Dreitlein consented to a 45-day suspension from any
SEC-regulated securities operations and an 18-month ban from
supervising any department that handles partial tender offers.
   ``These are practices that date to the early and mid 1980s,''
said Catherine Conroy, a spokeswoman for the Jersey City,
N.J.-based Pershing Division. She noted that DLJ has instituted
several steps to upgrade and strengthen the division and ``this
brings the matter to a satisfactory close.''

<HEAD>Business Leader Says Corporate Fears Were Exaggerated</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Those fearful predictions of 20 years ago that
environmental demands would cause unemployment and economic
stagnation have turned out to be overstated, a business leader says.
   Experience has shown that combating pollution is compatible with
economic growth, said Alexander Trowbridge, a former secretary of
commerce and chairman of the National Association of Manufacturers'
Industry Coalition for the Environment.
   ``Environmental improvement has been a corollary to economic
growth and has not come in spite of it,'' Trowbridge told a news
conference Tuesday.
   He said the ``dire predictions about environmental improvement
coming at the cost of jobs and national economic strength and high
prices'' have proven to be exaggerated.
   At the same time, he said, environmentalists' warnings ``that
Lake Erie would be dead, urban dwellers would be wearing gas masks,
rivers would be reaching a boiling point,'' also were overdrawn.
   Trowbridge said he was not contending there will not be
tradeoffs between jobs and the environment.
   But, he said, the record since Earth Day 1970 ``indicates that
economic growth, moderate but real, has taken place in these 20
years and environmental improvement has also taken place.''
   ``My judgment is that we've made progress both in the economy
and the environment and I think we'll continue to do so,'' he said.
   Trowbridge presented a report that said production of six major
pollutants has dropped sharply since 1970, while employment,
productivity, per capita income, industrial production and the
overall size of the economy have grown steadily.
   Environmentalists said they suspected that Trowbridge had made
an Earth Day conversion. Earth Day is being commemorated on Sunday
with events scheduled nationwide.
   ``Talk is cheap and action is not cheap,'' said David Gardiner,
legislative director of the Sierra Club. ``It's the
don't-worry-be-happy message at the same time the NAM and their
members are spending millions of dollars lobbying against changes
in law which would do a better job in improving the environment.
... What we're seeing from industry is Earth Day earth-hype.''
   ``It is an encouraging-sounding message, but just in the last
month and a half we've seen from the Business Roundtable and other
industry groups the most apocalyptical hype about how the Clear Air
Act is going to kill the economy,'' added David Doniger, senior
attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council.
   ``It will be interesting to see if, next time there is a piece
of legislation to be acted upon, the NAM will take a more
enlightened line,'' he said.
   But Trowbridge said a fundamental change has taken place in
corporate America. Environmental considerations are now being taken
into account in business decisions, he said.
   ``Environmental quality is a very key element of planning,
designing, building and producing,'' he said, ``and this has been
growing not only as a psychological factor but as a point of stated
policy.''

<HEAD>Confusion Reigns Over What's a Japanese or American Car</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If your car is made by American workers in
Michigan, Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, California, Illinois or
Ohio, that makes it all-American, right?
   Not if it's Japanese.
   More than 1.5 million 1990-model Hondas, Nissans, Toyotas,
Mazdas, Mitsubishis, Subarus and Isuzus will be made in the U.S.A.,
and a new study says the Japanese plants have brought significant
changes to an industry once dominated by Detroit.
   The growing automobile ``transplant'' industry is making it more
difficult to determine the true nationality of cars on the American
road _ or on the Japanese road.
   In Japan, the Ford Probe is made by Mazda, which is partially
owned by Ford, in a Michigan plant, using both American and
Japanese parts. It's sold as an American car.
   To add to the confusion over automobile nationality, you can buy
a Chrysler product made in Japan or a Pontiac or Ford made in South
Korea. And some Japanese transplants are starting to export their
U.S.-made Japanese cars to Japan.
   In a study financed by the import auto industry, researcher
Robert Z. Lawrence said Tuesday that expected growth in direct
foreign investment in U.S. auto manufacturing will create 110,000
jobs and lower the U.S.-Japan trade deficit by between $9.3 billion
and $15.2 billion below what it otherwise would be at the end of
1992.
   Lawrence said assembling foreign cars in the United States
benefits consumers by increasing competition and spreading auto
manufacturing beyond Detroit.
   ``In less than a decade, the U.S. auto industry had been
transformed from a virtually self-contained, highly concentrated
sector with limited competition from imports into an
internationalized industry with Japanese and U.S. producers
competing head to head,'' Lawrence's study said.
   The Commerce Department projects that more than 1.5 million
foreign cars will be made at seven plants in the United States this
year and 2.25 million passenger cars will be imported. New-car
sales are expected to exceed 8.5 million.
   Lawrence, who performed the study while on leave from the
Washington-based Brookings Institution, said he fears the
advantages of U.S. manufacturing may decrease if the value of the
dollar continues to climb in Japan,
   What began as an effort by Japanese automakers to head off U.S.
protective measures against imported vehicles became more
economically viable with the decrease of the dollar's value in
recent years, Lawrence said.
   He cited studies showing that when the dollar dips below 140
yen, automakers can make more by building in the United States than
in Japan, but when it goes above 150, the U.S. operations may
become less viable. The rate on the Tokyo Foreign Exchange Market
on Tuesday was 159.83 yen to the dollar.
   Complicating the analysis is the fact that some U.S. automakers
have a partial interest in Japanese companies.
   Honda started Japanese assembly of motorcycles in the United
States in the late 1970s and cars in 1981. Today's plants do more
than just assemble Japanese parts, however, Lawrence said.
   Some build engines and other components for export and the trend
is to use more U.S.-built parts, with some Japanese parts companies
also setting up U.S. operations.
   The study notes the following arrangements:
   _Chrysler buys the Conquest, Dodge Colt, Vista and Eagle Summit
from Mitsubishi and markets them as Chrysler products.
   _General Motors markets the GEO Prizm built in partnership with
Toyota in California, the GEO Tracker built in Canada with Suzuki
and the GEO Storm built in Japan.
   _GM's Pontiac LeMans is built by Daewoo Korea.
   _Ford's Festiva is built in South Korea.
   _The Mazda Miata was conceived at a Mazda design faility in
California.
   _Nissan and Ford plan vehicles developed by a Nissan operation
in Ann Arbor, Mich., to be built by Ford in Ohio with parts
supplied by a Nissan plant in Tennessee and to be marketed by both
Nissan and Ford.
   By 1992, Lawrence said, Toyota and Honda are expected to export
50,000 cars each from the United States to Japan. In addition,
20,000 U.S.-built Toyotas will go to Taiwan, which has resisted
increased Japanese imports.

<HEAD>Savings and Loan Failure Blamed on Fraud and Abuse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The failure of the $2.2 billion Silverado Banking
Savings and Loan was brought on by fraud and abuse _ not a
struggling Colorado economy, according to federal documents.
   Documents obtained by The Denver Post through the federal
Freedom of Information Act said the failed Denver thrift repeatedly
violated federal banking laws, the paper said in a copyright report
in today's editions.
   Regulators said that the December 1988 failure resulted from
``massive amounts of poorly underwritten loans, imprudent loan
concentrations ... and excessive compensation to senior
management.''
   Authorities had alleged that the thrift paid its top executives
millions of dollars, showed false profits, hid loan problems and
schemed to deceive regulators.
   ``Silverado has suffered due to violations of laws, rules and
regulations. The depressed condition of Colorado's economy has
served to exacerbate the losses incurred, but it is not the reason
for Silverado's insolvency,'' the regulators said.
   Officials said the situation illustrates the nation's $325
billion thrift crisis.
   ``There is a similarity that has emerged at all these (failed)
thrifts,'' said Tony Adamski, chief of the FBI's Financial Crime
Unit in Washington. ``In each case, rules and good management were
simply abrogated.''
   Reports show that Silverado's troubles began in 1980 just a year
after chairman Michael Wise took control and changed its name from
Mile High Savings.
   Regulators warned then of increasing problem loans, conflicts of
interest regarding an insider loan and ``deficiencies in internal
control.''
   The next year, regulators said Silverado was in danger of
falling below minimum required levels of capital. Then from 1983 to
1985, Silverado doubled in size each year, pouring loans into real
estate projects, seemingly without regard for the quality of the
loans, regulators said.
   During that time, the thrift's apparent profits almost entirely
came from fees generated from making loans, not the loans
themselves, regulators said.
   ``Typically, such a reliance on fee income is a red flag for
regulators,'' said Ronn Carr, of the federal Office of Thrift
Supervision in Topeka, Kan. ``It indicates there isn't an ongoing
source of income from loans.''
   In 1985 foreclosures rose 10 times to $17.7 million and
nonperforming loans quadrupled to $88 million, regulators said, but
instead of setting aside reserves, which would have produced a $20
million loss that year, Silverado reported an $8 million profit.
   In 1986 worried regulators set limits on Silverado's expansion.
   Other reports then followed until the failure in 1988 of
``imprudent business practices'' and even attempts to hide
escalating troubles in its loan portfolio, the documents said.
   In a cash-raising effort, Silverado issued $4.5 million in
Silverado stock to its senior officers, telling regulators they
bought it, the reports said. In fact, Silverado accountants just
issued the stock free of charge and recorded the purchases as
future pay, the reports said.
   Silverado also lumped all bad loans and real estate it acquired
through foreclosure into a $1.1 billion pool of major assets and
then reported to regulators the loan pool was a health asset,
reports said.
   The effect was to ``manipulate financial statements to report a
more favorable condition,'' regulators said in the documents.
   When federal marshals moved in in 1988, losses had reached $1
billion, officials said.

<HEAD>Panel OKs Antitakeover Bill to Protect Norton Co.</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: TOPS with Dukakis signing the bill; picks up 5th graf pvs
`Norton faces ...'</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With lightning speed, the Norton Co. received a
weapon today to help fight a hostile takeover bid from a British
firm.
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis signed a bill this morning designed to
stall a proxy fight for control over Norton's board of directors.
The bill, which takes effect immediately, was signed in Worcester,
the home of Norton.
   The measure sped through the Senate and House on voice votes
Tuesday, hours after a legislative committee endorsed the bill.
   ``We must do all we can to protect our best corporate citizens
and their workers and families from having their livelihoods wiped
out,'' Dukakis said in a statement. ``This bill gives companies a
well-deserved fighting chance against hostile raiders.''
   John Nelson, the chairman of Norton, told an enthusiastic crowd
of workers that the company ``will continue to fight to remain
independent.''
   Norton faces a proxy fight at its annual shareholders meeting,
currently scheduled for April 26. But Norton is asking a federal
Appeals Court to allow the company to delay the showdown until June
26 so executives have more time to plan a defense strategy.
   Norton last month rejected a $1.6 billion, $75-a-share offer
from BTR. But the British conglomerate says it will try to take
control of Norton's board at the shareholders meeting.
   The new bill attempts to stall that strategy by requiring
Massachusetts companies to elect their boards of directors over
staggered terms. A company, however, could opt out of the
requirement.
   Under the bill, only one-third of the directors would be elected
at a time, which means BTR would have to wait at least a year
before it could place a majority of directors on the board.
   Currently, a two-thirds vote by shareholders is needed for a
company to change to a staggered board.
   The United Shareholders Association, based in Washington, issued
a statement saying the bill ``would strip the right of shareholders
in Massachusetts companies of their ability to vote on the board of
directors annually.''
   State Sen. Lois Pines, the committee co-chairman, acknowledged
that Norton would have trouble shifting to staggered board terms
under current law because approximately 70 percent of its
shareholders are big institutional investors.
   But she insisted the bill protects shareholder interests.
   ``It is important for a company that has served the community
like Norton has to have the opportunity to make its own judgments
as to how to move forward within a reasonable amount of time,''
Pines said.
   BTR officials have vowed to continue their takeover bid even if
blocked from wresting immediate control of the Norton board.
   With the collapse of the junk bond market and other sources of
takeover financing, bidders increasingly are turning to proxy
fights, which makes the new legislation necessary, legislators said.
   The bill also includes an amendment that would protect worker
severance benefits if Norton succeeds in defending itself but is
forced to lay off employees.
   The measure guarantees that the additional protection afforded
to the board of directors would ``not be misused at the expense of
workers who have most at stake,'' Pines said.
   Under current state law, workers would receive severance
benefits if the takeover fight is successful and a new owner takes
control of the company. But legislators said that if Norton
succeeds, the battle could become quite costly and the company may
have to cut its payroll.
   ``The first round has gone to the workers,'' said state Sen.
John Houston, D-Worcester.

largest brokerage.
   For the first three months of 1990, Merrill Lynch earned $41.3
million, or 34 cents a share, compared with earnings from
continuing operations of $35.5 million, or 29 cents per share, last
year.
   However, revenue fell from the year-ago quarter to $2.66 billion
from $2.79 billion.
   Commissions, principal transactions, insurance and asset
management and custodial fee revenue increased, while interest and
dividend, investment banking and other revenue declined.
   ``Quarterly results improved despite a 5 percent decline in
total revenues, reflecting solid progrss in cost reduction, with
operating expenses down in virtually every category,'' Chairman
William A. Schreyer said in a statement.
   Schreyer said he expected a previously announced restructuring
program, which includes a downsizing through sharp staff
reductions, to positively impact earnings for the rest of the year.
   Merrill Lynch said quarterly expenses totaled $2.60 billion,
down 5 percent from the $2.73 billion reported in 1989
   Merrill Lynch and several other brokerage companies have been
retrenching because of slow business since the October 1987 stock
market crash.
   The company's restructuring includes divesting some product
lines and business activities, such as abandoning the European
commercial paper business; consolidating and relocating some
retail, institutional and other facilities; and reducing the size
of other operations.
   Merrill Lynch plans to eliminate about 3,000 jobs by the end of
1990 through layoffs, attrition and selling off businesses.

<HEAD>Boeing, EEOC Reach Agreement on Pilot Age-Discrimination Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Boeing Co. and the federal government have
announced an agreement to resolve a 1984 age-discrimination lawsuit
filed on behalf of company pilots removed from flight duty after
age 60.
   The consent decree announced Tuesday calls for raising the age
limit to 63 and annual testing of older pilots' physical and mental
condition, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and
Boeing said in statements issued in Seattle and Washington.
   The agreement also provides $4.4 million to be distributed among
29 pilots covered by the case.
   ``With this agreement, EEOC is breaking new ground in dealing
with age discrimination, specifically age ceilings for pilots,''
said EEOC chairman Evan J. Kemp Jr. ``The agreement calls for a
totally new testing procedure that may provide us with better tools
to fight employment discrimination based on age.''
   Seattle-based Boeing is satisfied with the proposed pact, which
is subject to approval by a U.S. District Court in Seattle, said
company spokesman Paul Binder.
   Under the five-year consent decree, Boeing would conduct the
tests in coordination with the EEOC until 1995, when the company
will decide whether the results warrant permanently lifting the
age-60 ceiling.
   If Boeing decides to reinstate the limit, the EEOC reserves the
right to sue, the agency said.
   The tests will include enhanced medical and performance
examinations as well as standard and experimental neurophysical
examinations used by the Federal Aviation Administration, the EEOC
said.
   All company pilots will take the tests at first, the agency
said, then they will be given annually to determine flight fitness
of pilots aged 57 to 63.
   EEOC general counsel Charles A. Shanor said he is confident the
tests will show modern testing and evaluations ``are a far more
accurate means of determining pilot competency and safety than the
use of chronological age.''
   ``The older, well-evaluated, medically cleared pilot brings to
the job experience and judgment vital to the safety of our
airways,'' Shanor said.
   Binder said Boeing would not have signed the agreement if it
left any doubts about pilot safety.
   A company statement said testing techniques have become more
proven in the 10 years since the previous age policy was adopted
``and individuals are generally more health-conscious now. By
moving to age 63 and adopting an enhanced medical-testing protocol,
we will continue our tradition of safe flight operations while
drawing on the flight experience of our long-service pilots.''
   In 1986, a U.S. District Court in Seattle decided the EEOC case
in Boeing's favor, saying the age-60 limitation was justified under
an occupational qualification exception to the Age Discrimination
in Employment Act. That exemption is based on the FAA rule that
commercial pilots must be removed from flight status at age 60.
   But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 1988 that the
policy's validity for non-commercial pilots should be decided by a
jury.
   If approved, the consent decree will resolve the case, which had
been set for trial this week. A fairness hearing on the decree is
scheduled May 11 in Seattle. The agreement would go into effect 30
days after court approval.

   The U.S. trade deficit shrank dramatically to
$6.49 billion in February, the smallest imbalance in more than six
years, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said that the 30 percent improvement
from a $9.32 billion January deficit came primarily from a big drop
in imported oil.
   Total imports fell by 7.6 percent to $38.12 billion while U.S.
exports, which had hit a record level in January, edged down a
slight 1 percent to $31.63 billion. The trade deficit is the
difference between what America imports and what it sells abroad.
   The changes gave the United States its lowest monthly trade
imbalance since December 1983, when it was $5.68 billion.
   The February deficit was significantly better than had been
expected, but economists said the good news was likely to be
shortlived.
   That would be a blow to the Bush administration, which is
counting on further gains in U.S. exports to lift the fortunes of
American manufacturers and provide a boost to a sluggish U.S.
economy.
   But at the White House, Michael Boskin, the chairman of the
White House Council of Economic Advisers, hailed the decrease in
the trade deficit as ``very good news indeed.''
   At the same time, Boskin said, ``We can't yet tell the extent to
which it is a temporary or permanent phenomenon.''
   Many private economists said that the trade deficit may actually
begin rising again this year as the United States grows more
dependent on foreign oil and demand for exports weakens because of
the strength of the U.S. dollar. A stronger dollar makes American
goods less competitive on foreign markets.
   Analysts were particularly disturbed by the fact that there were
widespread declines in a variety of U.S. export categories. The 1
percent overall drop wold have been even larger except for a huge
jump in shipments of aircraft.
   However, analysts said that was a temporary surge attributed to
a backlog in shipments at Boeing, which was idled late last year by
a strike.
   Donald Ratajczak, head of the economic forecasting project at
Georgia State University, said that he was looking for a 1990 trade
deficit of $105 billion, down only slightly from an $109 billion
imbalance in 1989.
   ``American competitiveness is not improving at the present time
and that is going to make it very hard to make further gains,''
Ratajczak said.
   In February, oil imports, which had surged by 44 percent in
January, fell by 20 percent to $4.71 billion as both the volume of
shipments and the price per barrel dropped.
   The big swing in both months was weather related. A severe cold
snap in December depleted supplies and forced record imports in
January. However, unusually warm weather in January reduced oil
demand in February.
   Analysts said with domestic oil production now at 25-year lows,
they expect foreign oil shipments to resume rising in coming months
with the price expected to climb as well.
   ``There is no question that we are going to import more oil in
1990 than in 1989 and it looks like we will import that oil at a
higher price,'' Ratajczak said.
   In addition to the drop in oil shipments, imports of consumer
appliances and other durable goods fell by 7.5 percent while
imports of clothing and other consumer nondurable goods dropped by
10 percent.
   However, imports of foreign cars were up by 25 percent to $2.56
billion in February.
   That was a primary reason that the deficit with Japan rose
during the month to $3.12 billion, accounting for close to half of
the overall deficit.
   The increased Japanese deficit is coming at a time when the Bush
administration is applying heavy pressure on Tokyo to make trade
concessions in order to ease tensions between the two countries.
   The February figures showed a $1 billion trade surplus with
America's other large trading partner, the countries of Western
Europe.
   President Bush met with Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu in
early March to discuss trade tensions between the two nations.
Since then, several trade agreements aimed at lowering Japanese
barriers have been announced.
   However, many in Congress remain unimpressed. They are demanding
that Japan be targeted once again when the administration releases
its list of priority countries for negotiations under a tough
section of the 1988 trade law known as Super 301.
   The Japanese have been arguing that they should not be cited
when the administration releases the new target list April 30
because of the concessions they have already made.
   But Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., urged Bush on Tuesday to target
Japan for a second round of priority negotiations.
   ``The progress that has been made toward opening the Japanese
market has been made because the United States has put on
pressure,'' Baucus wrote. ``Regrettably, if that pressure is
removed, I believe progress will stop.''

<HEAD>Heileman Negotiating New Debt Agreement With Creditors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LA CROSSE, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   G. Heileman Brewing Co., burdened by a
heavy takeover debt, is seeking to negotiate an arrangement to give
major creditors partial ownership in the company to discourage any
move toward liquidation.
   Company spokesman Bill Eiler, repeating statements made by
Heileman President Murray S. Cutbush on Monday, would not comment
Tuesday on the share of equity the banks might receive. Cutbush
also declined to name the banks involved in the negotiations.
   He did say that talks between Heileman and its debt holders
started some months ago, and that an accord has not been reached.
   Cutbush told the trade journal Advertising Age the banks have
decided their chances for recovering funds are much improved by
letting Heileman continue to market beer instead of selling off
parts of the company, perhaps at bargain prices.
   The financial pressures on Heileman stem from Australian
businessman Alan Bond's debt load. Bond Corp. bought Heileman in
1987 in a highly leveraged $1.3 billion deal.
   Analysts late last year estimated Heileman's debt at $850
million despite the sale of its profitable bakery division and
other smaller assets.
   Last summer, Heileman negotiated a deal with creditors under
which it does not have to make any principal payments on
outstanding loans until June 30.
   Heileman has already begun cost-cutting measures to keep ahead
of debt collectors. Earlier this month, the company scaled down its
advertising operations by consolidating all of its advertising with
one or two agencies.
   Cutbush also said the company will take a hard look at making
corporate sponsorship programs ``cost effective.''
   Eiler said Heileman breweries in St. Paul, Minn., and
Frankenmuth, Mich., are still up for sale. But he added they were
the only assets Heileman planed to put on the market.
   Beer industry sources put Heileman's total worth at $250 million
to $350 million. But Jerry Steinman, publisher of Beer Marketer's
Insights, a trade publication, said that figure falls woefully
short of Heileman's liabilities, which he said may have prodded the
company's debt holders to come to the negotiating table.
   ``The banks were in a bad position,'' Steinman said. ``Heileman
owes over a billion dollars, which is more than Heileman is worth.
So the banks were in a position where they would lose a lot.''
   Steinman added that any restructuring of Heileman's debt would
be beneficial for the company.
   ``The company certainly comes out ahead if they don't have to
pay the old loan payments,'' he said.
   Steinman said preliminary numbers on 1990 sales for Heileman
suggest a 10 percent decline from sales a year ago. Heileman sales
in 1989 were down about 9.7 percent after suffering an almost
identical decline in 1988. The 1989 decline was the largest of
America's major brewers.

   An attorney for Eastern Airlines fought off
creditors' attempts to have a trustee take over operations, saying
a liquidation of the carrier ``is likely to become
self-fulfilling'' if a trustee is named.
   Lawyer Zack Clement also told a bankruptcy hearing Tuesday that
Eastern's unsecured creditors would recover only about 7 percent to
14 percent of the money they're owed if the carrier is liquidated.
   Miami-based Eastern is resisting requests by its unions and
unsecured creditors to appoint a trustee for the financially
sagging company and take control away from Frank Lorenzo, chairman
of its parent Texas Air Corp.
   Judge Burton R. Lifland heard a third day of testimony over the
proposal and Eastern's request for release of $80 million from
escrow to help finance its second-quarter operations. The hearing
was scheduled to continue today.
   Eastern attorney Bruce Zirinsky said Friday that Eastern needed
the cash by Monday or Tuesday. But he told The Associated Press
after Tuesday's hearing that ``there's no immediate need for cash.''
   Zirinsky declined to elaborate. But a source close to the
companies, who spoke on condition of anonymity, suggested that
Texas Air had committed to covering Eastern's second-quarter
expenses.
   Separately Tuesday, Eastern made a pension fund payment of
around $14 million that was due this week to the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corp., a government agency. In addition to its other
debts, Eastern has about $830 million in unfunded pension
liabilities, according to the agency.
   Also Tuesday, Jose Smith, Eastern's senior vice president of
operations, resigned from the company. Eastern spokesman Robin
Matell said Smith had accepted a job at Coca-Cola Co. and his
departure was unrelated to Eastern's bankruptcy proceeding. Smith,
who has worked for Eastern for 23 years, could not be reached for
comment immediately.
   But Eastern President Phil Bakes, asked by a reporter today
about Smith's departure, said his decision ``has something to do
with what is going on here, in this courtroom.''
   Bakes declined comment on speculation that Texas Air could offer
Bakes' resignation as a compromise to the creditors. ``There's been
a lot of negotiations, a lot of discussions ... I'm not going to
discuss it,'' he said.
   Texas Air later issued a press statement calling the speculation
about Bakes ``totally untrue.''
   Smith will not be replaced and his position will be eliminated,
Matell said. The vice presidents of flight operations and
maintenance, who have been reporting to him, will now report
directly to Joseph Leonard, Eastern's executive vice president and
chief operating officer.
   At the hearing, Clement said an analysis by Eastern financial
adviser Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. indicated the unsecured
creditors would receive 6.7 cents for every dollar owed if Eastern
were liquidated now. They would get 14.3 cents on the dollar if
Eastern were liquidated following completion of the proposed sale
of its South American routes to American Airlines.
   Eastern owes $980 million to the unsecured creditors, who are
mainly suppliers of equipment such as aircraft and engines. The
group rejected a recent reorganization proposal from Eastern that
would pay them 25 cents on the dollar, including 5 cents cash and
the remainder in notes.
   Earlier in the hearing, Eastern's top marketing official warned
that appointing a trustee would shake the confidence of travel
agents and the flying public in the airline at a time Eastern is
desperate for business.
   George Brennan, Eastern's vice president of marketing, also said
such a move could prompt many Eastern managers to resign.
   ``I know, like myself, many of them would consider the
appointment of a trustee the end of the line for that team,'' he
said.
   The unsecured creditors' committee has insisted it does not want
to liquidate Eastern but says it might seek a buyer for all or part
of the airline.
   Eastern's preferred shareholders, who are owed $680 million,
still are seeking to liquidate the airline.
   Lifland reiterated that if he named a trustee, that person would
be charged with operating the airline.
   ``Liquidation is not some of the baggage that a trustee
necessarily carries with him,'' Lifland said.
   Elliot Seiden, a vice president and associate general counsel of
Texas Air, said appointment of a trustee also could delay
government approval of Eastern's proposed $349 million sale of its
Latin American routes. He said such a delay would be nearly as
serious as a rejection of the sale because Eastern is in severe
need of the sale proceeds.
   James L. Garrity, an assistant U.S. attorney, told the court the
Department of Transportation has not taken a position on the
trustee issue. He said the appointment of a trustee in itself would
not delay a final decision on the route sale, to which the
department has given tentative approval.
   But Garrity said if there was a ``clear indication'' that
liquidation would follow the appointment of a trustee, approval
likely would be delayed.
   Eastern's pilots, Machinists and flight attendants unions struck
Eastern on March 4, 1989, forcing the Miami-based airline into
bankruptcy protection five days later. The Machinists union remains
on strike.

<TEXT>
   First-quarter earnings for pharmaceutical
giant Merck &amp; Co. increased 19 percent in 1990, boosted by growth
in new product sales, the company announced Wednesday.
   For the three months ended March 31, income rose to $403.8
million, or $1.03 per share, from $340.4 million, or 86 cents a
share, during the corresponding 1989 quarter, Merck said.
   Sales for the first quarter of this year were $1.76 billion, a
12 percent increase over the nearly $1.6 billion for the same
three-month period in 1989.
   ``Sales growth for the quarter was led by new products,''
chairman and chief executive officer P. Roy Vagelos said. ``Both
our domestic and international operations reported unit volume
gains.
   Sales outside the United States accounted for 45 percent of
Merck's first quarter sales, compared with 49 percent during the
same period last year, Vagelos said.
   Strong showings by the company's human and animal products
divisions also helped first-quarter sales.

   The U.S. dollar fell against most major currencies
in European trading Wednesday despite figures showing a narrowing
U.S. trade deficit.
   Gold prices rose.
   Currency dealers said they were surprised the market reacted
negatively to news that the U.S. February trade gap had shrunk to a
six-year low of $6.49 billion from a revised $9.32 billion in
January.
   ``There was the wildest speculation about the trade figures and
many people were apparently even more optimistic than the data
allowed,'' said a trader at a large European bank in West Germany.
   ``A lot of the market had heard the rumors of hugely improved
trade figures and set themselves up with that (in mind),'' added
David Brown, senior spot foreign exchange dealer for the Royal Bank
of Scotland.
   Some dealers said the trade data, when viewed against the
backdrop of recent sluggish jobs growth in the United States,
didn't provide sufficient fundamental support to encourage the
market to push the dollar higher and encouraged some profit taking.
   Despite the decline, dealers said they expect the dollar to firm
because of political tensions in the Soviet Union and weakness in
the Japanese yen.
   ``The dollar's general stability hinders any sharp moves,'' said
the West German trader.

   Capital Cities-ABC Inc. said Wednesday its
first-quarter profit jumped 28 percent, including a sharp
improvement in the performance of the ABC Television Network,
especially for its prime-time lineup.
   Capital Cities-ABC said it earned $106.3 million, or $6.08 per
share, for the three months ended April 1 compared with $82.8
million, or $4.59 a share, a year earlier.
   First-quarter revenue rose 13 percent to $1.26 billion from
$1.12 billion in 1989.
   The media company said its overall operating income rose 29
percent to $211.5 million, with income from broadcasting operations
rising 35 percent.
   It said the ABC Television Network reported ``a very significant
profit'' in the latest quarter compared with a ``modest profit'' in
the same period in 1989. The company attributed the improvement to
the network's ``strong prime-time revenue performance.''
   Revenue was up significantly at the network because of ``strong
advertising demand and a continuation of satisactory audience
delivery in all dayparts except daytime,'' the company said.
   On Tuesday, ratings figures for the three major networks showed
ABC held second place in the 30-week TV season ended Sunday
although it gained ground on the leader, NBC.
   ABC averaged a 12.9 rating, the same as in 1988-89, while NBC's
ratings fell 9 percent to 14.6. CBS averaged a 12.2 rating, down 4
percent.
   Each ratings point represents 921,000 homes.
   Last week, CBS Inc. reported a 52 percent increase in its
first-quarter earnings to $85.3 million on a 16 percent revenue
increase to $851 million.
   It said its ad sales were strong mainly because it telecast the
Super Bowl football game and the NCAA basketball playoffs. CBS
called its prime-time ratings disappointing.
   NBC's earnings are not broken out separately by its parent,
General Electric Co.
   In addition to the network, Capital Cities-ABC's broadcasting
operations include eight television stations, the ABC radio
networks and 21 radio stations.
   The company said operating earnings improved slightly from the
TV stations declined at the radio stations on modest revenue gains.
   Operating income from video operations were well ahead of a year
ago on significant revenue increases, the company said, while
publishing earnings decreased slightly on an acquisition-driven 6
percent increase in revenue.
   The company publishes daily and weekly newspapers, shopping
guides, specialty and business periodicals and books.

   The Coca-Cola Co. reported Wednesday that its
first quarter earnings increased 9.1 percent from last year, with
the soft drink maker's biggest gains continuing to come overseas.
   Earnings for the quarter were $283.5 million, or 83 cents a

the same period in 1989.
   Operating revenues were up 12.4 percent to $2.1 billion from
$1.9 billion last year.
   Gallon sales of concentrates and syrups outside the United
States increased 9 percent and case sales to retail customers were
up 10 percent over the first quarter last year.
   Sales were particularly strong in Europe, the company said, with
a 23 percent increase in gallon sales and a 14 percent increase in
case sales.
   In the United States, case sales increased by 3 percent and
gallon sales were up 2 percent. In the first quarter of last year,
U.S. gallon sales had increased 7 percent.
   ``We have started the decade of the '90s where we left he decade
of the '80s _ on a roll,'' said Coca-Cola Chairman Roberto C.
Goizueta.
   ``Our company's focus on strengthening its global soft drink
system continues to produce outstanding worldwide volume results on
top of a superb performance in the same period of the prior year,''
Goizueta said.

   American General Corp., an insurance company in a
proxy fight with Torchmark Corp., on Wednesday reported 10.2
percent growth in its first-quarter earnings.
   The company, which is based in Houston, earned $101.14 million,
or 90 cents per share, on revenue of $1.04 billion for the three
months ended March 31.
   During the same period last year, the company had earnings of
$97.17 million, or 77 cents per share, on revenue of $1 billion.
   ``The improved earnings in the first quarter are the hard-won
rewards of a very complex and difficult restructuring program. We
believe these results signal the beginning of a new era of progress
for American General,'' said Harold S. Hooks, American General's
chairman and chief executive officer.
   American General, with subsidiaries that operate in 50 states
and Canada, is in a battle with Birmingham, Ala.-based Torchmark,
best known for its Liberty National Mutual Insurance subsidiary.
   Torchmark made a surprise $6.4 billion offer for American
General last month and a week later withdrew its offer, opting
instead to solicit proxies to elect its own nominees to American
General's board of directors.
   A Houston federal judge issued a preliminary injunction that had
kept Torchmark from lobbying American General's shareholders in
support of theirv slate.
   But a three-judge panel from the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals last week stayed the injunction.
   American General shareholders are scheduled to elect six
directors at American General's May 2 annual meeting.
   American General mailed a letter to its shareholders Tuesday to
support its nominees and reject Torchmark's shareholder resolution
calling for American General to hire an investment banking firm and
appoint a committee of independent directors to evaluate
acquisition proposals.

   United Technologies Corp. said Wednesday
its first-quarter earnings rose 8.7 percent, citing strong
performances by its Pratt &amp; Whitney engines and Otis elevator
operations.
   For the quarter ended March 31, UTC said its net income
increased to $134.5 million, or $1.01 a share, compared with $123.7
million, or 95 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue for the quarter rose 6.7 percent to $4.8 billion from
$4.5 billion last year.
   Robert F. Daniell, chairman and chief executive, said strong
performance from Pratt &amp; Whitney and Otis more than offset lower
operating results at Carrier, UT Automotive and the Flight Systems
segments.
   UTC's business backlog reached a record $21.2 billion on March
31, up from a record $18.2 billion a year earlier. In the quarter,
Pratt &amp; Whitney announced $3.1 billion in commercial engine orders,
including options.
   Quarterly operating income for UTC's power segment _ which
includes Pratt &amp; Whitney's commercial engines, government engines
and Canadian operations _ grew to $251 million from $179 million a
year earlier, primarily due to higher spare parts sales, continuing
cost reduction efforts and lower spending on research and
development.
   UTC's buildings systems segment _ which includes Otis _ earned
$92 million, compared to $76 million a year earlier. Company
officials said the improvement was due to the strong international
operations of Otis.
   UTC's flight systems segment reported a loss of $11 million for
the quarter, compared to operating earnings of $12 million a year
ago. The company said Sikorsky and Hamilton Standard, two divisions
in the flight systems segment, had lower profits because of less
favorable product mix and reduced royalty income.
   UTC's industrial segment also had a profit decline, dropping to
$16 million from $53 million. The decline was attributed largely to
production of fewer automobiles and light trucks in North America
as manufacturers reduced dealer inventories.
   United Technologies manufactures high-technology products and
support services to the aerospace, building systems and automotive
industries.

   The European Community on Wednesday
questioned the U.S. commitment to international trade accords and
cited a wide range of trade barriers.
   In its fifth annual report on the matter, the EC Executive
Commission listed nearly 50 tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade
imposed by either Washington or individual U.S. states.
   These included quantitative restrictions, discriminatory public
procurement policies, unreasonable requirements for product
testing, labeling and certification as well as high customs fees,
export subsidies and tax barriers.
   The EC report said these ``raise doubts whether the United
States is sufficiently committed to the multilateral system which
provides the main reference point for resolving disputes.''
   The report said the U.S. must bring its trade legislation
``fully in conformity with multilaterally agreed rules.'' It
criticized Washington for adopting trade laws that ``conflict with
multilateral rules'' and for adopting ``clearly illegal'' trade
measures.
   ``Contrary to popular belief in the United States,'' the U.S.
government was guilty of the types of trade barriers it accuses
other nations of erecting, the report said.
   In addition, it accused U.S. officials of tardiness in complying
with rulings of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the
Geneva-based international trade body.
   ``The Community is concerned by the extent to which non-tariff
barriers to its exports now seem to be more and more at the state
rather than at the federal level,'' the EC report said.
   It blamed state regulations on taxation and on financial and
professional services, among others, for creating ``serious
handicaps to doing business in the U.S. market.''

<HEAD>Researchers Announce Breakthrough In Corn Genetics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two teams of researchers say they have produced
genetically altered corn plants capable of passing on their newly
acquired genes to the next generation, an advance that other
scientists hailed on Wednesday as a breakthrough.
   The technique should allow scientists to develop new strains of
disease-, insect- and herbicide-resistant corn much more quickly
than they can using traditional cross-breeding techniques, the
researchers said.
   Genetic engineering of corn, the largest and most valuable U.S.
farm crop, has long eluded researchers despite their success with
such crops as soybeans, cotton, tobacco and tomatoes, said Michael
Fromm, a molecular biologist at an Albany, Calif., research center
operated by the Agriculture Department and University of California
at Berkeley.
   Fromm headed a research group that also included Monsanto Co.
scientists and which announced its findings Monday at a conference
in Keystone, Colo. Researchers from DeKalb Genetics Corp., a seed
company based in DeKalb, Ill., announced similar findings Wednesday
at the Colorado conference.
   Both groups of researchers used a ``gene gun'' to shoot
microscopic gene-coated bullets into corn cells, which were then
grown into mature plants. Those plants were then fertilized with
pollen and produced a new generation of seedlings which were shown
to have the same genetic traits that had been engineered into their
parents.
   ``The technology is now here to begin applying genetic
techniques to corn,'' Fromm said in a telephone interview.
   The scientists said it would be several years before genetically
engineered corn products are ready for commercial marketing.
   ``It is the gene transfer technology that is important,'' said
Catherine J. Mackey, director of the DeKalb research team, in a
news release.
   ``This development is the result of many years of research by a
team of scientists,'' she said.
   Genetic researchers have been successfully engineering new
strains of soybeans, tobacco and some other crops for several
years, using a technique involving bacteria that do not work well
with corn and other cereal crops, Fromm said.
   He said the invention five years ago of the Biolistics gene gun
at Cornell University paved the way for genetic engineering of corn.
   In the USDA-Monsanto project, scientists transferred two genes:
one that allows corn cells to grow in the presence of a growth
inhibitor and another, derived from firefly genes, that causes corn
cells to glow very faintly _ too faintly to be seen with the naked
eye.
   The DeKalb scientists transferred a gene that makes corn cells
resistant to a certain herbicide.
   Alan Kriz, an assistant professor crop molecular genetics at the
University of Illinois, said the findings did indeed represent a
breakthrough.
   Kriz said genetic engineering could produce plants resistant to
pests and disease and nutritionally superior to today's varieties.
   ``Corn grain is deficient in certain amino acids,'' Kriz said.
``We should be able to begin altering for those traits as well
now.''

<HEAD>Media General Posts 77 Percent Plunge in 1st Qtr Earnings</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with reports from Multimedia Inc. and

<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Media General Inc. on Wednesday reported a
77 percent drop in its first-quarter profit from a year earlier as
newspaper earnings contracted due to a downturn in advertising.
   Meanwhile, two other media companies cited advertising weakness
in reporting their quarterly results. Regardless, Multimedia Inc.
posted a 30 percent earnings gain. But McClatchy Newspapers Inc.'s
profit was cut in half.
   Media General said income in the first quarter of 1989 was
boosted by a gain. But excluding that one-time gain, earnings this
year still were off 56.3 percent.
   Total revenue slipped slightly, by less than 1 percentage point.
   ``Although 1990 revenue growth is expected, the uncertainty of
the economy currently is clouding the earnings outlook,'' said
James S. Evans, the company's president and chief executive officer.
   Net income fell to $2.7 million, or 10 cents a share, from $11.9
million, or 46 cents a share in the first quarter of 1989. First
quarter 1989 net income included an after-tax gain of $5.7 million,
or 22 cents a share, from the sale of a California newsprint
recycling mill.
   Revenue declined to $148 million from $149.3 million last year.
   Media General said newspaper profits were 44.2 percent lower in
the first quarter than a year earlier. The company blamed the
decline on faltering national, retail and classified advertising
sales caused in part by consolidation within the retailing industry.
   In particular, a Media General spokesman pointed to the
bankruptcy of Miller &amp; Rhoads Inc. in late 1989. The retailer was
once Media General's largest advertising client, a Media General
statement said.
   The media company is the parent of the Richmond Times-Dispatch
and The Richmond News Leader and other daily newspapers as well as
several broadcast operations. Broadcast operation profits increased
2.5 percent.
   Multimedia, which is based in Greenville, S.C., earned $6.05
million, or 49 cents a share, in the first quarter, up from $4.64
million, or 37 cents a share, in 1989.
   Total revenue rose 3.3 percent to $109.83 million from $106.30
million.
   The company said newspaper revenue and operating cash flow were
behind last year mainly because of a sluggish retail advertising
environment and a downturn in automotive advertising. The Easter
advertising season will be credited to this year's second quarter
rather than the first because the holiday fell in April this year
instead of March as it did in 1989.
   Multimedia publishes 13 daily and 49 non-daily newspapers, owns
and operates 4 television and 7 radio stations and operates more
than 100 cable franchises in 4 states. It also produces and
syndicates television programs including the Phil Donahue and Sally
Jessy Raphael shows.
   McClatchy Newspapers, which is based in Sacramento, Calif.,
reported income of $2.36 million, or 8 cents a share, in the first
quarter, down from $4.85 million, or 17 cents a share, in 1989's
first quarter.
   The major factors causing the deterioration in profitability
were a weakening in ad linage at most newspapers, startup losses
from a newsprint mill partnership and costs related to the
acquisition in January of six newspapers bought in South Carolina.
   Revenue rose 9.4 percent to $95.1 million from $86.9 million.
   McClatchy operates 11 daily newspapers, eight non-daily
community papers and several senior citizen tabloids.

   Many Japanese have luxury cars, diamonds and a
penchant for some of the most expensive delicacies, but find one
coveted item out of reach _ land.
   Property prices have driven up business costs, widened the
wealth gap between landowners and landless, and made home ownership
impossible for the average Japanese. Some banks offer 100-year
loans that can be passed down through generations, a mortgage
unheard of elsewhere.
   Land inflation has given Japan 60 percent of the value of all
real estate worldwide, though it comprises 0.3 percent of the
world's land mass.
   It's not that there's an acute shortage of land on the island
nation that became the economic miracle of the 20th century.
Rather, it's a murky combination of bureaucracy, tax shelters,
lobby interests and unbridled speculation that has made Japan the
planet's priciest piece of real estate.
   Moreover, the enormous value attached to Japanese land has
potential economic consequences that go far beyond the borders.
   For example, property prices affect the financial strength of
speculators and other large investors, who have used their land as
collateral to buy stocks. As much as half of Japan's phenomenal
stock market growth of recent years is rooted in the value of
Japanese real estate.
   Some economists fear a fall in real estate values could
devastate the stock market, which already has dropped dramatically
this year for other reasons, and send financial shock waves around
the world. But others contend property prices must fall as part of
a broader reform of Japan's economy.
   In talks on changing business practices that have contributed to
the longstanding U.S. trade deficit with Japan, the government
promised earlier this month to curb land inflation.
   Besides U.S. pressure, there also was recognition that drastic
measures are needed to control real estate speculation and prevent
the divide between property owners and non-owners from upsetting
Japan's social stability, said Kisaburo Ishii, a Construction
Ministry official involved in the talks.
   Land prices in Tokyo soared 23.8 percent in 1987 and 65.3
percent in 1988 before the increase slowed to less than 2 percent
last year, the National Land Agency reported.
   Nationwide, however, they jumped 17 percent after climbing 21.7
percent in 1988 as speculative inflation spread to other major
Japanese cities. Last year in Osaka, Japan's second-biggest city,
commercial land prices surged 43.9 percent and residential prices
58.6 percent.
   The world's most expensive commercial property, in central
Tokyo's Marunouchi and Ginza business districts, is valued at about
$23,700 a square foot.
   Office space in Tokyo rents for an average $191 a square foot,
vs. $156 in London and $64 in New York. With vacancy rates hovering
around 0.2 percent, it's a landlord's market.
   After touting the ``my home'' dream for years, newspapers now
feature tales of families who scrimped for decades only to find
even a modest home 90 minutes outside Tokyo well out of reach.
   An average-size house of about 960 square feet about an hour's
commute from central Tokyo costs $316,000. Inside Tokyo, prices
shoot above $632,000 for houses and about $378,000 for smaller
condominium apartments.
   Although mainstream wage-earners now earn an average of $50,000
annually, many are doomed to a renter's life, since banks generally
will lend only four times an annual income for a conventional home
mortgage.
   Competition for new homes in Tokyo's vast suburbs is so intense
that hundreds apply for each opening. Many homes are sold by
lottery before the foundations are laid.
   Some families, giving up on ever owning a home, instead are
spending on cars, travel and other luxuries.
   Nationwide, an average of about 60 percent of all households own
their homes. In greater Tokyo _ home to around 30 million of
Japan's 122 million people _ only 40 percent do.
   ``The government must deal with this problem,'' said Susumu
Ichihata, senior managing director of the Urban Research Institute
in Tokyo. ``Now that most Japanese live in cities, these problems
could cause political unrest.''
   While rents on older apartments have been controlled for
decades, newcomers to the housing market face rents prohibitively
high.
   Spacious Western-style apartment rentals fetch $3,140-$9,500 a
month. A 650-square-foot Japanese-style unit rents for about $820.
   Landlords customarily demand at least four months' rent up front
_ part refundable deposit, but about two months' rent in
nonrefundable ``key money,'' paid for the privilege of becoming a
tenant.
   Renters find the home scramble a nightmare.
   ``I've just returned to Tokyo and we need to move to a bigger
flat. I'm really in a bind because there's no way we can afford to
buy a home,'' said Tadao Aoki, a government aide who recently
returned from a posting abroad.
   Most real estate purchases in Tokyo today are by people with
property to sell or to borrow against and by brokers buying and
reselling land to profit from price increases.
   Real estate investment, with its various writeoffs, is seen as
the easiest way for many high income earners and landowners to
avoid high income and inheritance taxes.
   The incentive becomes great for property brokers, supported by
bankers anxious not to miss a fast-growing market, to jack up
prices.
   ``Banks accept the unrealized value of property as collateral
and provide financing the same way a casino shucks out poker
chips,'' said Tokunosuke Hasegawa, head of the Research Institute
of Construction and Economy.
   Real estate lending is so lucrative that banks apparently have
ignored repeated Finance Ministry warnings to cut back.
   The government also is considering tax reforms aimed at shifting
about 148,200 acres of farmland and underutilized acreage in the
Tokyo metropolitan region to residential use.
   Farmland owners pay less than 0.0001 percent of the assessed
value of their land in taxes, compared with 70-80 times that rate
for residential land. Farmland also is virtually exempt from
inheritance taxes, which can rise as high as 80 percent of
inherited assets.
   Tax reforms promised in Japan-U.S. trade talks, however, face
strong opposition from the powerful farm lobby and inertia among
people accustomed to paying low taxes, even if it means living
without sewer lines.
   Although many Japanese fear falling land prices could hurt the
economy, some economists contend that lower land prices would allow
the Japanese to build bigger, better houses _ a development certain
to boost the economy in the long run. Others say a property-market
decline would squeeze out the worst of the speculators who have
profited enormously from the cycle of land inflation.
   ``This is a bubble economy, and it's time for the bubble to
burst,'' said Hasegawa. ``The real, productive economy won't really
be hurt. Land and people won't disappear, but phony wealth will.''

   The stock market posted a broad loss today,
registering little enthusiasm over the latest news on the nation's
international trade balance.
   The Commerce Department reported that the U.S. trade deficit in
February shrank to its narrowest reading in more than six years.
Imports exceeded exports by $6.49 billion, down from $9.32 billion
in January.
   Analysts said that held out the prospect of
stronger-than-expected growth in economic output, and improved
profits at many companies with a substantial international business.
   At the same time, however, the figures touched off fresh worries
about the outlook for interest rates.
   In the credit markets prices of long-term government bonds fell
more than $10 for each $1,000 in face value, increasing their
yields to the 8.84 percent-8.90 percent range.

   Occidental Petroleum Corp. said Wednesday its
first-quarter profit rose 62 percent despite a $96 million tumble
in earnings from its chemical division.
   Combined results from oil, natural gas and gas transmission
operations rose by $98 million, offsetting the lower chemical
division profits, Occidental said.
   The big oil, chemical and agribusiness company said it earned
$108 million, or 37 cents per share, compared with $67 million, or
24 cents per share, in the same period in 1989.
   Revenue increased by 2 percent, from $5.1 billion to $5.2
billion.
   Higher worldwide crude oil prices, higher domestic natural gas
and natural gas liquids prices, and the resumption of oil
production in the North Sea helped push oil and gas division
earnings to $100 million, compared with $35 million in the same
period a year earlier.
   Natural gas transmission earnings were $94 million, compared
with $61 million for 1989, reflecting lower operating costs, a rate
refund and a $12 million benefit from an adjustment to certain tax
reserves.
   The chemical division's earnings fell from $282 million to $186
million, reflecting lower margins in petrochemicals, polymers and
plastics, mainly due to industry-wide lower prices, Occidental said.
   The 1990 results also reflected a $36 million pretax gain from
the settlement of a claim against Venezuela stemming from the 1975
nationalization of Occidental operations.

   Oil prices continued to slide Wednesday
despite a vague call by a trio of OPEC heavyweights for cutting
back on the the overproduction of crude oil.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the near-term crude
contract settled at its lowest level in 16 months despite a
statement from the oil ministers of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the
United Arab Emirates urging production restraint.
   ``It's a fairly empty statement,'' said Nick Antill, an analyst
at County NatWest in London.
   Rumors swept the markets that Kuwait and the United Arab
Emirates, members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, had privately agreed to slash their output.
   But, Lucy Mullins, an analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in
London, said the market ``is taking all of this with a large pinch
of salt.''
   ``If they wanted to reduce (production), they would probably
have included it in the statement,'' said Pierre Terzian, editor of
the Paris-based newsletter Petrostrategies.
   Moreover, Mullins said previous promises by persistent cheaters
Kuwait and the Emirates to trim supply have ``not meant very much
at all.''
   The two Gulf countries have been pumping well above the quotas
OPEC sets for each of its 13 members, creating a world oil glut
during the often-weak second quarter of the year.
   Analysts estimate OPEC output at more than 24 million barrels a
day, exceeding the ceiling of 22.1 million barrels a day in effect
for the first half of the year.
   Prices began plummeting sharply last week, prompting hurried
discussions among OPEC nations about whether to hold an emergency
meeting.
   No session has yet been called, but a source close to the
presidency of the cartel, who demanded anonymity, said it remains
an option. Algerian Mines Minister Sadek Boussena is the current
OPEC president.
   There was no mention of a special meeting in the statement
issued by the oil ministers who met Tuesday evening in Jeddah,
Saudi Arabia.
   ``It seems that the Jeddah message is the following: Do not meet
for the moment unless prices collapse,'' said Terzian.
   The average price of a basket of seven crudes monitored by the
cartel plunged to $15.38 per 42-gallon barrel last week, well off
the organization's target of $18 a barrel.
   The basket price was $17.12 a barrel in the first week of April.
   On New York's Merc, the contract for May delivery of West Texas
Intermediate, the benchmark American brand, fell 48 cents to settle
at $16.96 a barrel. The contract, which lost 41 cents on Tuesday,
had been off as much as 84 cents during the day.
   It had been trading in the range of $20 to $21 a barrel early in
April.
   Antill predicted prices would continue slipping in advance of
the regular OPEC meeting in late May, when the oil ministers are to
set their pricing and output guidelines for the last half of the
year.
   Mullins said the excess of oil will ``continue to keep prices
depressed'' in the next few weeks.
   OPEC officials had been expecting prices to decline in the
April-June period, when demand for oil normally weakens with warmer
temperatures in the United States and other consuming nations. But
last week's sudden fall was a surprise.
   In their statement, Saudi Arabia's Hisham Nazer, Kuwait's Ali
Khalifa al-Sabah and the Emirates' Mana Saeed Otaiba expressed
``grave concern about the recent developments in the market.''
   They blamed the fall in prices on increased crude production by
both OPEC and non-OPEC countries.
   ``The solution, which would guarantee relative market stability,
is for OPEC members to commit themselves to respect the production
ceiling and the individual production quotas set out for the member
states,'' according to the statement carried by the Saudi Press
Agency.
   Analysts estimate that Saudi Arabia, the world's leading oil
exporter, is producing about 300,000 barrels a day above its quota
of 5.4 million barrels.
   The Emirates is pumping about 2 million barrels a day, double
its quota, according to the estimates. Kuwait is believed producing
about 1.9 million barrels a day, over its cap of 1.5 million
barrels a day.

<TEXT>
   House Democrats unveiled their own $1.2
trillion budget for next year on Wednesday, a plan that calls for
$8 billion less in military spending than President Bush wants.
   The package, which the House Budget Committee plans to vote on
Thursday, would also increase spending by $6 billion on programs
that include child care, NASA and aid to Central America, Eastern
Europe and Africa.
   The proposal is the first detailed response by Democratic
leaders to the 1991 fiscal year budget Bush requested in January.
At the time, Democrats complained Bush's spending blueprint was not
a serious effort to reduce the deficit, and was too generous to the
military at a time of lessening tensions with the Soviet Union.
   ``The world has changed greatly,'' said House Speaker Thomas S.
Foley, D-Wash., who outlined highlights of the plan at a news
conference with other top Democrats. ``The United States is
obviously now in a position to look more intensively at the
problems that lie within our own country.''
   House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif.,
predicted approval by his Democratic-dominated panel. He said the
package reflects ``a transition from military confrontation to
economic leadership, from a Cold War economy to a peacetime
economy.''
   Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota, ranking Republican on the budget
panel, called the proposal ``a typical Democratic budget without
discipline.'' GOP lawmakers will vote aganst the Democratic plan,
he said, and continue pressing for talks between Congress and the
administration as the best way to close the budget gap.
   The Democratic proposal claims to trim the 1991 deficit by $36
billion to $63.8 billion. That would be just below the $64 billion
target set by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction act, which
requires a balanced budget by 1993. Fiscal 1991 begins Oct. 1.
   The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office has said the
administration is underestimating next year's deficit by $70
billion. It expects the 1991 budget deficit to be $161 billion
before budget reduction starts.
   The Democrats would slice $11.5 billion off the amount the
military would need next year to stay abreast of inflation. That
would leave defense spending at $295 billion _ $8 billion less than
Bush wants.
   They would shrink defense spending by $251 billion over the next
five years, about a 25 percent cut. The Democrats would spend $106
billion of that on domestic programs, and count $145 billion
against the deficit.
   The Democrats would also cut next year's military budget
authority to $286 billion, $30 billion below the total needed to
keep up with inflation. Budget authority is the amount of spending
an agency can enter into over a number of years. The reduction is
crucial because it would signal the start of a long-range decline
in Pentagon spending.
   Panetta's plan would raise taxes by $13.9 billion, the same
amount Bush proposed in January, and collect an additional $5.6
billion in new government fees.
   The anticipated growth of Medicare and other federal benefit
programs would be slowed by $4.2 billion. Other savings would
include delaying a federal pay raise for three months and improving
the efficiency of tax collection.
   The plan would also boost spending in several areas of science,
including NASA; improve federal health efforts for children, and
increase expenditures for education, road building and anti-crime
intiatives.
   The congressional budget process was getting its formal start
after weeks of closed-door meetings among Democratic budget-writers
and party leaders.
   They spent much of their time fashioning a compromise on
Pentagon spending _ which represents one-fourth of the budget _
between conservatives seeking levels similar to Bush's request, and
liberals who wanted deeper cuts.
   Panetta and other leaders also had to sound out their members
about two well-publicized budget plans released by two top
Democrats earlier this year. In the end, they decided to ignore
both proposals.
   Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., of the tax-writing House Ways
and Means Committee had proposed saving $55 billion next year with
a wide range of spending cuts and tax increases. Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., suggested cutting the Social Security
payroll tax by $55 billion to intensify concerns about the budget
deficit.
   Because these decisions had to be made, Congress again missed
the April 15 legal deadline for completing its budget. The
requirement is routinely ignored year after year.
   Budget work is also going slowly in the Senate, where Budget
Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn., is having trouble
rounding up enough votes to move a spending plan out of his
committee. Sasser favors cutting defense by $15 billion, about $3.5
billion more than Panetta wants.
   The budget resolution need only be passed by Congress and does
not need the president's signature.
   It is only a blueprint for spending and savings. Later bills
will determine how the government spends its money and which taxes
_ if any _ will be raised.

   Crude oil futures settled lower Wednesday, but
bargain hunters on a last-minute buying spree helped lift prices
from their worst levels.
   Still, traders remained largely bearish amid disappointment that
a recent meeting of OPEC ministers failed to produce any tangible
results.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the contract for May
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S.
crude oil, slid 48 cents to $16.96 per 42-gallon barrel after
plummeting 41 cents on Tuesday. The contract, which traded as low
as $16.60 a barrel, hasn't settled as low since December 1988.
   But other contract months took far less of a hit. June crude was
off just 30 cents a barrel while the August contract was down 34
cents.
   Analysts are reluctant to attach too much significance to
declines in the May contract since it expires Friday. As a contract
nears its expiration, its price becomes increasingly more volatile.
   The May contract closed $1.13 lower than the June contract when
a more typical discount is closer to 30 to 50 cents a barrel, noted
Bob Baker, senior energy analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Refined petroleum products traded on the Merc fell sharply after
finishing mixed on Tuesday.
   The contract for May delivery of unleaded gasoline lost 0.89
cent to settle at 59.55 cents a gallon after rising 0.23 cent on
Tuesday. Home-heating oil for May delivery dropped 1.51 cents to
52.69 cents a gallon after losing 0.52 cent in the previous session.
   Traders were disappointed that a meeting of three OPEC ministers
failed to result in a plan to cut ongoing overproduction by some
cartel members.
   Analysts estimate OPEC output at more than 24 million barrels a
day, exceeding the ceiling of 22.1 million barrels a day in effect
for the first half of the year.
   After a meeting late Tuesday, oil ministers of Saudi Aabia,
Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates issued a weak statement saying
they were gravely concerned about market conditions. The
triumvirate said the solution would be for members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to hold to
agreed-upon production ceilings.
   But the lack of any clear-cut plan ``brought out cynicism that
OPEC can't handle their affairs,'' Baker said.
   The market got ``nothing more than vague assurances that for two
months they won't overproduce,'' said Peter Beutel, an assistant
director at Elders Futures Inc.
   ``There's a great deal of skepticism that that will actually
come to pass and that it will have that big an effect on the
market,'' he added.
   Crude futures prices reflected the pessimism throughout the
session. But about a half hour before the close, prices turned
higher as bargain-hunters began to buy.
   Meanwhile, natural gas for June delivery settled at $1.583 per
million British thermal units, off slightly from $1.585 on Tuesday.

   The dollar lost ground Wednesday against all
major currencies in heavy trading despite new data showing the
nation's huge trade imbalance had improved significantly in
February.
   Gold prices rose worldwide.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery settled at $376.10 a troy ounce, 90 cents higher than late
Tuesday's close. Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late
bid for gold at $376.30 an ounce, up $1.30.
   The Commerce Department reported that the U.S. trade deficit
narrowed in February to a six-year low of $6.49 billion from a
revised $9.32 billion gap the previous month.
   Imports fell by 7.6 percent, to $38.12 billion, while exports
totaled $31.63 billion, a modest 1 percent decline from an all-time
high set in January, the department said.
   While the report would be considered bullish for the dollar,
since it means further reductions in the currency may not be needed
to improve the balance of trade, dealers showed little enthusiasm.
   ``The numbers were certainly strong ... but people expected
stronger numbers,'' said J. Thomas Stanley, manager of corporate
foreign exchange for Chemical New York Capital Markets Group.
   Stanley said the dollar had firmed prior to the trade report but
fell back after its release.
   ``There was the wildest speculation about the trade figures and
many people were apparently even more optimistic than the data
allowed,'' added a trader at a large European bank in West Germany.
   Also depressing the dollar, traders said, were rumors that some
Japanese financial institutions might be considering selling more
of their U.S. bond holdings.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose to 159.87 Japanese yen from 159.83 yen
Tuesday. It traded at 159.15 yen in London, and at 158.125 yen in
New York, down from 159.685 Tuesday.
   The dollar was weaker against the British pound. Sterling rose
to $1.6347 from $1.6340 in London, and to $1.6400 from $1.6383 in
New York.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Tuesday's quotes, included: 1.6720 West German marks, down from
1.6765; 1.4785 Swiss francs, down from 1.4895; 5.6200 French
francs, down from 5.6360; 1,228.25 Italian lire, down from
1,231.75; and 1.16135 Canadian dollars, down from 1.16485.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday: 1.6720
West German marks, down from 1.6770; 1.4876 Swiss francs, down from
1.4900; 5.6315 French francs, down from 5.6370; 1.8855 Dutch
guilders, down from 1.8885; 1,230.50 Italian lire, down from
1,232.00; and 1.1640 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1680.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $375 an ounce from
$374.05 late Tuesday. In Zurich, gold closed at $375.50 an ounce,
up from $374.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold gained 48 cents to $375.87 an ounce.
   But silver prices were mixed. Silver bullion for April delivery
settled at $5.065 a troy ounce on New York's Comex, down 2.8 cents
from late Tuesday. Silver rose in London to $5.11 an ounce from
$5.07.

<HEAD>First Quarter Earnings Decline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp. on Wednesday reported
its first-quarter earnings fell 23 percent partly because of
declines in two business units.
   Net income for the quarter ended March 31 totaled $110.31
million, or 60 cents a share, off from earnings of $143.30 million,
or 77 cents a share in the year-ago quarter.
   Operating revenue increased 8.5 percent to $1.15 billion, from
$1.06 billion a year earlier.
   Revenue growth for the quarter amounted to 4 percent when
adjusted to reflect the acquisition of Management Science American
in late 1989 and the divestiture of Thomas Cook Travel USA a year
ago, the company said.
   Operating income was off 25 percent at $168.78 million, compared
with $224.82 million a year earlier.
   Dun &amp; Bradstreet, which markets business information worldwide,
attributed the declines in both profits and operating income to a
decrease in revenue at its U.S. Credit Services, its commercial
credit information business.
   The company also was adversely affected by the expiration of a
contract with Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Telephone Co. Dun &amp; Bradstreet's
Donnelley Directory sold advertising space for the phone company's
Yellow Page directory.
   Separately, the company's marketing information services,
financial information services and business services units each
posted revenue gains.
   Last month Dun &amp; Bradstreet annouced it would divest a number of
operations, including Datastream International and Interactive
Data, Neodata Services and Petroleum Information to simplify the
company's ``business mix.''
   During the first quarter, the company purchased 2.64 million
shares of its stock under a 10-million-share repurchase program
approved in November 1989.

<HEAD>Defense Contractor Reports Higher Profits, Sales</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Dynamics Corp., the nation's second
largest defense contractor, reported Wednesday that first-quarter
profits were up 64 percent thanks to a one-time gain from the
settlement of an antitrust litigation.
   Without the big boost, General Dynamics net earnings would have
slipped 17 percent.
   The company, headquartered in St. Louis, had profits of $123.7
million, or $2.97 a share, for the quarter, which ended March 31.
That compares to $75.4 million, or $1.81 share, for the same period
in 1989.
   Sales for the quarter were $2.5 billion, up 5 percent from $2.4
billion in the first quarter of 1989.
   The one-time gain in the quarter of $61.5 million came March 22
when General Dynamics and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
settled a 7-year-old lawsuit in federal court in Chicago.
   The lawsuit alleged that AT&amp;T tried to monopolize the market for
business telephone systems and other equipment with several unfair
business practices. The settlement included a denial of all
allegations by both parties.
   Stanley Pace, chairman and chief executive officer, said profits
declined in every defense-related segment of the company including
military aircraft, submarines and missiles, space and electronic
systems.
   He said that the company had reduced its earnings expectations
on its F-16 program because of higher costs and transfer of
employees to other projects and in its missiles, space and
electronic systems segment because the company earned fewer
contracts than expected.
   On the positive side, Pace said, the successful market
acceptance of Cessna's Citation V business jet was the key factor
in a dramatic increase in sales and earnings in the company's
general aviation sector.
   Cessna delivered 16 Citation Vs during the first quarter, nearly
half of the total delivered last year. Pace said Cessna holds 92
additional orders.
   The CEO said an increase in interest expense to $19.4 million
from $14.1 million in the same period a year ago reflected the
higher level of company borrowing. The increased borrowing was made
necessary by accelerated tax payments required by changes in
accounting methods and for continuing investments in advanced
programs, he said.

<HEAD>AMR Blames Higher Fuel, Labor Costs For First Loss In Nine
Quarters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Airlines' parent AMR Corp.
posted a $19.3 million first quarter loss Wednesday, blaming higher
fuel and labor costs for its first loss in more than two years.
   ``Our results can only be called unsatisfactory,'' said Chairman
Robert L. Crandall.
   AMR, whose American Airlines is the nation's biggest airline, is
the first of the nation's major airline companies to report
earnings for the traditionally slow first quarter. Analysts expect
most airlines to report losses or smaller profit than last year.
AMR's loss was less than many industry analysts had expected.
   AMR said it lost 31 cents per share on total operating revenue
of $2.69 billion. In the same period last year, AMR had a profit of
$156.7 million, or $1.60 per share, on revenue of $2.45 billion.
   Expenses increased by $402.1 million, the company said, with
26.5 percent coming from higher fuel prices. Fuel jumped from
$322.3 million in the year-ago quarter to $428.7 million this year.
   Labor costs also rose $85 million while other expenses were up
$210.7 million.
   American Airlines, which accounts for almost 94 percent of AMR
revenues, lost $23.6 million, compared with a profit of $158.4
million last year. The loss wiped out profit from other AMR
subsidiaries, which include American Eagle commuter airline, and
several subsidiaries related to the travel and information
industries.
   ``Cargo volumes are strong,'' Crandall said. ``The growth of
passenger traffic in the international markets, particularly
Europe, the Caribbean and Asia, was outstanding, but growth in
domestic markets was weak.''
   During the quarter, American expanded its operations in Europe
and Australia. The company also agreed to buy the Latin American
operations of Eastern Airlines, a deal which is still pending
federal review.
   AMR also has 14.6 percent more employees this year than last
year.
   The company flew 17.5 billion passenger miles compared to 16.2
billion in the same quarter last year.
   ``When a company is growing like that, there're a lot of upfront
costs,'' said analyst Mark Daugherty at Dean Witter Reynolds.
   ``They've invested a lot in planes, employees, and training for
the long term. The unfortunate result is in the short term it
involves a lot of expenses.''
   AMR said its revenue yield per passenger mile, a key measure of
performance, was unchanged at 12.73 cents.
   The passenger load factor also was unchanged at 59.9 percent.
However, the break-even load factor _ the percentage of seats that
must be occupied for the airline to break even _ moved from 54.8
percent last year to 60.6 percent this year.

<HEAD>Crude Futures Hit 16-Month Low On Weak OPEC Response To Oil Glut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Crude oil futures prices settled below $17 a barrel for the
first time in nearly 16 months Wednesday on the New York Mercantile
Exchange as prices fell in response to the lack of a strong OPEC
response to the worldwide oil glut.
   On other commodity markets, sugar futures surged; grains and
soybeans were mixed; precious metals were mixed; and livestock and
meat futures were mixed.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures settled 21 cents to 48
cents lower in New York with the contract for delivery in May at
$16.96 a barrel. It was the lowest settlement price for a
near-month crude oil contract since Dec. 29, 1988, although crude
traded as low as $16.25 on April 11.
   Heating oil futures finished .87 cent to 1.51 cents lower with
May at 52.69 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .45 cent to .94
cent lower with May at 59.55 cents a gallon.
   Oil traders were unimpressed with a vague call by three OPEC
heavyweights for cutting back on the overproduction of crude oil.
   Production by some members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries in excess of their OPEC-imposed quotas has been
cited by some analysts as a major cause of a global oil glut and
the resulting 22 percent drop in prices since early March.
   The oil ministers of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab
Emirates met Tuesday evening in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and later
issued a statement urging production restraint.
   ``I think that given the circumstances, the market was looking
for more,'' said Andrew Lebow, an energy analyst with E.D. &amp; F. Man
International Futures Inc.
   Traders had little reaction to Tuesday's weekly U.S. oil
inventory figures from the American Petroleum Institute. The trade
group reported a modest 814,000-barrel increase last week in U.S.
supplies of crude oil.
   Randall Rothenberg, an energy broker with Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc., said the oil market ``remains in a bearish mode'' in the
absence of a stronger OPEC response to the situation.
   Sugar futures prices leaped on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa
Exchange as rumors circulated that the Soviet Union was quietly
buying physical sugar on the cash market.
   Prices were further supported by talk that India and Mexico may
enter the market as buyers later in the year, analysts said.
   Sugar settled .21 cent to .48 cent higher with May at 15.40
cents a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures settled mostly lower on the Chicago
Board of Trade amid light profit-taking after two days of gains.
   The soybean and soybean oil markets posted the steepest losses
after exhibiting the greatest strength in the two previous sessions.
   Soybean oil for delivery in May settled 29 cents lower Wednesday
at $22.71 per 100 pounds. The contract had gained a total of 99
cents in the two previous sessions.
   Wheat futures ended 1} cents lower to { cent higher with May at
$3.65\ a bushel; corn was \ cent to 1\ cents lower with May at
$2.73} a bushel; oats were \ cent to { cent lower with May at
$1.57{ a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents to 3{ cents lower with May
at $5.94\ a bushel.
   Gold futures rose slightly on New York's Commodity Exchange,
supported by falling stock prices. Silver futures fell moderately.
   Gold finished 90 cents to $1.30 higher with April at $376.10 a
troy ounce; silver was 3 cents to 3.1 cents lower with May at
$5.078 a troy ounce.
   Livestock and meat futures ended mixed on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange with strength centered in the near-term contracts,
reflecting higher cash markets.
   Live cattle futures settled unchanged to .15 cent higher with
April at 79.87 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to
.15 cent higher with April at 84.10 cents a pound; live hogs were
.35 cent lower to .35 cent higher with April at 56.80 cents a
pound; frozen pork bellies were 2 cents lower to .37 cent higher
with May at 59.42 cents a pound.

<TEXT>
   Forty-six union presidents representing 18,000
USX Corp. employees said Wednesday they oppose Carl Icahn's
proposal to break up the company's steel and energy assets.
   However, a statement on the issue won't be released until it has
been reviewed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, said Gary
Hubbard, spokesman for the United Steelworkers of America.
   Icahn, USX's largest shareholder, has proposed spinning off the
company's steel business, saying two separate companies will be
worth more than one.
   His proposal plan will be put to a non-binding vote of USX
stockholders at the company's May 7 annual meeting in Findlay, Ohio.
   The union's statement will be mailed to shareholders after it
has been cleared by the SEC, Hubbard said.

   AT&amp;T Chairman Robert E. Allen defended his
company Wednesday against protesters who accused it of caving in to
abortion foes and union members who said it pushed workers out of
jobs to boost profits.
   Union workers picketed outside as Allen delivered an optimistic
message to shareholders at American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s
annual meeting. The workers accused AT&amp;T of achieving profits by
unnecessarily laying off 13,500 workers in 1988 and planning to
discharge another 9,000 this year while raising some executives'
pay by 35 percent.
   ``Jobs with justice!'' the protesters chanted as about 1,000
stockholders of AT&amp;T, one of the most widely held and largest of
U.S. companies, filed into a huge hall at the Los Angeles
Convention Center.
   The demonstrators accused AT&amp;T of exporting jobs to countries
with cheap labor. Allen said that was done only when absolutely
necessary to stay competitive or to sell products in the foreign
countries themselves.
   Allen also faced questions about AT&amp;T's cutoff of funding to
Planned Parenthood Federation of American Inc., to which AT&amp;T had
given more than $200,000 over the past 25 years.
   AT&amp;T said last month it would not give the group a donation next
year due to the controversy over abortion. This year, AT&amp;T donated
$50,000.
   Planned Parenthood accused AT&amp;T of ``corporate cowardice'' in
full-page ads in New York and Los Angeles newspapers. The group
said AT&amp;T's donations have not been used for abortion services, and
that the company's recent contributions have been restricted to
teen pregnancy prevention programs.
   Typical of the complaints was a letter from New York City
Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman, who wrote on behalf of the city's
employee pension fund, which owns AT&amp;T stock.
   ``... By providing family planning assistance, Planned
Parenthood helps to reduce unwanted pregnancies and thus the
incidence of abortion,'' she wrote.
   At a news conference before the meeting, Allen said Planned
Parenthood recently shifted its position and became a strong
advocate of legalized abortion. He said AT&amp;T could not afford to
jeopardize its corporate position of neutrality on abortion.
   ``We became tainted ... and tarnished among a number of our
constituents,'' he said, ``because we became known as (having) a
pro-abortion stance.''
   At the meeting, shareholders spent about 45 minutes discussing a
proposal from one stockholder that would have instructed the
company to refrain from supporting any pro-abortion organization.
The company recommended that shareholders reject the proposal,
citing its wish to remain neutral.
   Shareholders overwhelmingly turned down the proposal, with 618.7
million shares voted against it to 36.1 million in favor, said AT&amp;T
spokesman Dick Gray.
   As for layoffs, Allen said AT&amp;T has ``unfortunately'' been
forced to cut its work force by 102,000 salaried and hourly
employees since 1984, when it was required to spin off its regional
telephone companies.
   ``This is not an easy task for any of us but it is necessary if
we are to compete in any of our markets,'' he said.
   AT&amp;T and unions representing 135,000 of its employees reached
tentative agreement Tuesday on improved pension benefits designed
to encourage early retirements and thus reduce the need for layoffs.
   Allen told shareholders that the company had its best year ever
in 1989 in terms of profits, revenues, earnings per share and stock
price.
   ``AT&amp;T is moving forward into the decade of the 1990s, fleeter
of foot, quicker in its reponse to customers and to changes in the
marketplace, more alert to new targets of opportunity for growth,''
he said, according to a company statement.
   He said the company planned to introduce in about five years
equipment that would switch phone signals by pulses of light,
dramatically increasing the capacity of the phone network.
Currently, light is used to send phone signals over fiber optic
lines, but the light pulses must be converted back to electrical
impulses before they are switched to other lines.
   Before the meeting, AT&amp;T reported that its first-quarter profit
rose 12.5 percent to $668 million, or 62 cents a share, compared
with earnings of $594 million, or 55 cents a share, in the first
three months of 1989. Revenue totaled $8.89 billion, up 2.7 percent
from $8.66 billion.

   For an image-obsessed outfit like the Walt
Disney Co., the soiled Mickey Mouse disposable diapers scattered
throughout garbage dumps don't exactly proclaim environmental
activism.
   MCA Inc. is making points with a company recycling program and
earth-friendly television shows, movies, videos and records. But
some critics say the entertainment conglomerate is mismanaging
Yosemite National Park, which an MCA subsidiary oversees.
   Industrial giants from Exxon Corp. to Union Carbide Corp.
present fat targets for environmentalists. But the reach of the
green movement has grown so much that even Disney and MCA, home of
such squeaky clean characters as Snow White and E.T., now must
answer to the ecological accountants.
   Not long ago, the world looked to Hollywood for escapism. In
recent years, however, public pressure has led the entertainment
industry to reexamine its depiction of alcohol abuse, violence
toward women, birth control and bigotry.
   Now that the environment has become the hot issue, Hollywood
once again is trying to set an example.
   NBC's ``ALF'' is among the most environmentally conscious TV
shows. One recent episode had the furry alien battling
chlorofluorocarbon polluters. NBC distributed note pads of recycled
paper to advertise the show.
   The episode reflected well on NBC and its parent, General
Electric Co. But GE isn't ranked too highly by environmental groups.
   At GE's annual meeting April 25, for example, shareholder
activists have resolutions on the agenda urging the company to
devise a plan to stop producing hazardous wastes and cut its own
chlorofluorocarbon pollution.
   These days, the entertainment industry is not content generating
ecological programs, such as The Disney Channel's presentation this
month of anti-pollution shows.
   Instead, many Hollywood companies are practicing their own
environmentalism. Disney and MCA, for example, say they're
motivated by genuine concern.
   ``We're not out to publicize our efforts,'' said Garrett De
Bell, MCA's environmental consultant.
   Last month Disney appointed a new environmental czar, Kym
Murphy, who reports directly to company chieftains Michael Eisner
and Frank Wells, and says they realize ``the amazing responsibility
we have.''
   ``Our ability to influence is remarkable, and the perception
people have of us is really hard to live up to,'' Murphy said.
   Has Disney done so? Not entirely, he acknowledged.
   ``I think if you ask people, `Does Disney recycle,' they would
say, `Gee, they must if anybody does.' ''
   In fact, Disney does not. Disney is anxious to start a better
program, he said.
   One of Murphy's first chores was contacting the Procter &amp; Gamble
Co., which buys licenses rights to print little Disney characters
on the adhesive strips that hold Disney Babies disposable diapers
to infant bottoms.
   Disposable diapers are among the fastest-growing components of
landfill rubbish. About 16 billion are dumped each year.
Environmentalists say they can take decades to decompose.
   Murphy said Procter &amp; Gamble researchers are ``pulling out all
the stops'' to make their products more environmentally safe.
   His other chief environmental headache has been Disney's
quasi-city government that exercises near-total power over 27,000
acres surrounding the company's Florida operations, home of Walt
Disney World and other fun parks.
   For the past two years, Disney has come under heavy criticism
from some local community leaders who say it doesn't pay the
environmental costs generated by millions of tourists.
   Disney finally agreed to pay $14 million in additional property
taxes, but then angered locals even more by announcing construction
of seven more hotels, 29 new attractions, a fourth amusement park
and 19,000 more workers.
   ``They can go out there and pave over anything they want to do
without going through any kind of environmental review,'' said Bill
Donegan, an Orange County, Fla. commissioner who'ss led an effort
to make Disney more accountable.
   ``We don't know the real impact environmentally. We don't know
how many woodpeckers' nests have been destroyed, how many eagles,
how many ospreys.''
   MCA has been trumpeting its attention to the environment, both
on the Universal Studios lot and in film and TV. At MCA offices in
Universal City, the company began a company-wide recycling program
using containers decorated with a Woody Woodpecker logo.
   The staff at MCA subsidiary Universal Television met last fall
with representatives of the Environmental Media Association, an
organization that promotes earth-friendly messages in the
entertainment industry.
   Andy Spahn, EMA director, said producers asked how recycling
themes could be incorporated into storylines.
   ``This is not a problem that can be solved by government action
alone,'' he said. ``Through film, television and music, the
industry is in a unique position to reach millions of people and
show them they can make a difference.''
   Others say the real test of a company's commitment to the
environment is not whether it makes shows about recycling. More
important, they say, is whether a company's decisions do more for
the planet than for profits.
   ``High profile companies cannot change the world
single-handedly, but they can set an example,'' said Richard
Branson, chairman of Virgin Records and Virgin Atlantic Airways and
a long-time environmental activist.
   ``It's so often people will talk about causes without doing
something that actually affects themselves or their business,''
said Branson.
   Sleeves for Virgin's records (artists include Paula Abdul, Soul
II Soul) are recycled paper. Virgin Atlantic says it will plant a
tree for every passenger flying between London and Los Angeles in
the next 12 months.
   At the Hard Rock Cafe chain, employees sort waste paper and
beverage bottles, said founder Peter Morton.
   ``We're not suddenly converts to the environmental movement now
that it's fashionable,'' he said, noting that the phrase ``Save the
Planet'' has been part of the company's logo for 10 years.
   Despite earning millions of dollars at Yosemite on a concession
fee of $600,000, MCA's Yosemite Park and Curry Co. is as committed
to the park as it is to shareholders, the company says.
   Environmental consultant De Bell, who lives in Yosemite, said
that when Yosemite switched from polystyrene cups to recyclable
paper containers, it cost MCA about $20,000. ``We want to do good
business and improve the environment as much as possible,'' De Bell
said.
   Dan Jensen, executive vice president of MCA's Curry unit, said
the subsidiary declined an offer worth hundreds of thousands of
dollars from a automobile maker wanting to call itself Yosemite's
official car.
   ``We would have been preying on the name Yosemite which is not
ours to own,'' Jensen said.
   Environmental critics say MCA has spent too much marketing the
California park and doesn't spend enough money maintaining it.
   De Bell said the criticisms have been blown out of proportion
because ``Yosemite is a shrine of the environmental movement.''

<HEAD>Liquidating Firm To Sell Asset Management Group for More Than $6
Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thomson McKinnon Inc. agreed Wednesday to sell
its interest in an asset management subsidiary for more than $6
million, as the parent of the failed Wall Street firm Thomson
McKinnon Securities Inc. continues liquidating.
   Thomson McKinnon said it was selling its 63 percent interest in
its remaining operating entity, Thomson McKinnon Asset Management
LP, to a group of the subsidiary's managers and two Boston
investment firms.
   The asset management unit is a mutual fund and private account
money manager for $6.7 billion in assets. It operated as a separate
entity since a public stock offering in 1987.
   Under the proposal, Greylock Investments, TA Associates and key
managers of the unit will form a company to acquire the asset
management subsidiary.
   The new company will pay $800,000 for 200,000 general
partnership units in the subsidiary and $5.4 million for an option
to buy the balance of Thomson McKinnon's units at a price of $4.53
per unit.
   Thomson McKinnon Securities, the firm's brokerage unit, filed
for Chapter 11 federal bankruptcy court protection from creditors
last month. The 105-year-old firm had sought a buyer since the 1987
stock market crash.
   The firm stopped doing business last July after selling its
retail brokerage offices and customer accounts to Prudential-Bache
Securities Corp. for about $60 million. The deal followed a
collapse of a proposed merger.
   Thomson McKinnon said in a statement that the sale of the asset
management division anticipates a renewed marketing effort for its
mutual fund activities. The new company also will acquire Thomson
McKinnon Fund Distributors Inc. from the brokerage subsidiary.
   The investors' proposal requires approval of the creditors of
Thomson McKinnon, the brokerage subsidiary and a U.S. Bankruptcy
Court judge.
   The asset management division includes the mutual funds Cash
Accumulation Trust, Thomson McKinnon Investment Trust and Thomson
Accumulation Plan Trust. It also advises private accounts through
its Columbus Circle Investors division and Foxhall Investment
Management division.

   Do celebrities really care about spotted owls,
the ozone layer and rain forests? Or are they simply tree-hugging
the cause of the week?
   The evidence suggests that while numerous entertainers _ actor
Ed Begley Jr. and singer Jackson Browne among them _ have adapted
environmentally friendly living practices, many others are slow to
practice what they preach.
   At a recent Beverly Hills benefit for the Brazilian rain forest,
an array of Hollywood celebrities _ superstars like Jane Fonda and
agent Michael Ovitz _ were warned of the dangers of global warming
and pollution.
   The 1,000 or so guests dined on organic foods. They raised $1.2
million for the environment. Then they went for their limos, idling
patiently, stretching for blocks. Exhaust filled the evening air.
   It was scarcely an isolated slip. When Hollywood's blue-ribbon
Environmental Media Association held its first organizational
meeting at producer Norman Lear's house, EMA founders arrived in
Mercedes, BMWs, Rolls-Royces and other gas-guzzlers.
   Producer Ted Field and wife Susie, who hosted the Beverly Hills
rain forest benefit, are longtime contributors to the Natural
Resources Defense Council and charter members of EMA. They also
have been known to fly to their spacious Aspen home in a private
jet.
   ``It's great celebrities are getting involved,'' said Bob
Hattoy, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club. ``But it's not about doing
lunch. It's about changing the way that we live. Lifestyles of the
rich and famous are often lifestyles of the wasteful and
indulgent.''
   ``The entertainment industry is symbolic of the values of
everyone in our culture,'' said Bonnie Reiss, who founded the Earth
Communications Office. ECO seeks to add environmental themes to
television shows and movies.
   ``We have to get the rich and famous to truly examine their
lifestyles,'' Reiss said.
   Environmentalism has yet to become Hollywood's flavor of the
month. All the same, the nation's trendsetters are catching on
slowly. Hollywood has long been the land of excess, and tradition
does not die easily.
   At an April news conference for ABC's Earth Day special,
celebrity performers were ferried to the event in _ you guessed it
_ limousines.
   Tom Cruise has visited the Amazonian rain forest and is a member
of the ECO. So is his next movie about global warming? Not quite.
Cruise stars next in ``Days of Thunder,'' a movie about the hardly
fuel-efficient sport of auto racing.
   Scientists reckon a third of all global warming gases are
transportation-produced; neither Paramount Pictures nor Cruise's
publicist could say how many thousands of gallons of fuel were used
making ``Days of Thunder.''
   Olivia Newton-John, a top environmental activist, is damaging a
stretch of the Southern California coastline, her Malibu neighbors
have charged in a civil complaint.
   Newton-John and her husband have polluted the ocean with tons of
dirt and sand removed during the construction of their 6,000 square
foot home overlooking the beach, the complaint charges.
   ``It's blown way out of proportion,'' Newton-John said. ``I had
an environmental specialist look at the property. I care about the
environment.''
   Die-hard environmentalists don't wear furs or leather. So how
did people dress at the Beverly Hills rain forest benefit?
   Singer Don Henley, who performed at the fund-raiser, said he had
visited the cloak room before coming on stage. What did he see?
``About a quarter of a million dollars' worth of dead animals.''
   Actor Begley is one of the handful of personalities who has
reordered his life to save the planet. He rides a bicycle or takes
the bus to work, has a compost heap in his back yard and has
installed 15-watt bulbs in his house.
   ``We don't need any more definition of environmental problems,''
Begley said. ``We need action.''
   David Zucker, co-director of ``Airplane!'' and the director of
``Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad,'' now drives an
electric car. Dennis Weaver, star of the TV series ``McCloud,'' has
designed an ``ecologically balanced'' house in Colorado.
   ``We're building it out of old tires packed with dirt,'' the
actor said. ``The electricity will come from solar cells and all
water will be heated by the sun.''
   Other leading earth activists include Ted Danson, Lloyd Bridges,
Hart Bochner and Melanie Mayron.
   Reiss said that Cruise organized a recycling program on the
``Days of Thunder'' set, lives in a modest house and rides his
motorcycle to save fuel.
   ``I feel Tom Cruise is extremely committed,'' Reiss said. ``Does
he have room to grow? Everyone has room to grow.''

<HEAD>Sprint Plans to Proceed with IRS Information Service</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   US Sprint Communications Co. said Wednesday it
will go ahead with a disputed proposal to offer special 800-number
calling for taxpayers seeking information from the Internal Revenue
Service.
   One of Sprint's major rivals, MCI Communications Corp., had
challenged the ``enhanced'' toll-free offering, saying the service
fell outside the scope of the contract for the new federal
long-distance system known as FTS 2000. Sprint is providing 40
percent of FTS 2000; AT&amp;T has 60 percent.
   MCI lost out in the bidding for FTS 2000, estimated to be worth
$25 billion over 10 years, and has been ready to pounce when any
federal agency has sought to add services not explicitly outlined
under the FTS 2000 contract.
   After the FTS 2000 contract was awarded in December 1988, the
IRS said it needed special call-routing service to handle the huge
volume on its incoming 800 lines. The agency planned to let AT&amp;T
provide the enhanced 800 service, but when MCI protested, it agreed
to open up the bidding to outside companies.
   But the General Services Administration, which oversees FTS
2000, told the IRS it could have the service under FTS 2000.
Because Sprint's share of FTS 2000 system included the IRS, the GSA
said Sprint could offer the additional service.
   MCI claimed the GSA's decision in favor of Sprint amounted to an
impermissible sole-source award. But the federal Board of Contract
Appeals rejected MCI's claim on Feb. 27.
   The appeals board action allowed Sprint to sign a letter of
intent with the government for the enhanced 800 service, Sprint
spokeswoman Janis Langley said Wednesday.
   The taxpayer assistance service handles more than 60 million
calls per year, according to Sprint, which valued the contract at
$450 million over 10 years.
   Sprint plans to have all the voice traffic in its FTS 2000
contract switched over to Sprint's network by the end of the month.
Langley said the special 800 service should be in place by the end
of the year.
   MCI spokeswoman Pam Small said the company still was considering
an appeal on the Feb. 27 decision in the U.S. Court of Appeals.
   The FBI confirmed in February that it is investigating claims
that Sprint illegally obtained competitors' confidential bid
information to win the FTS 2000 contract. Sprint has denied the
allegations, which were contained in a suit filed in Washington by
two former Sprint employees.

<HEAD>Allied Closing Two Jordan Marsh Department Stores</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Jordan Marsh Co., the New England
department store chain owned by Allied Stores Corp. is closing
stores in Lowell, Mass., and Danbury, Conn.
   Cincinnati-based Allied and Federated Department Stores, which
own 260 stores nationwide, have been operating under Chapter 11
bankruptcy law protection from creditors since Jan. 15.
   ``Because of our Chapter 11 status, it is incumbent upon us to
review all contracts, all services and all store operations with a
keen eye,'' Jordan Marsh chairman Richard Van Pelt said in a
prepared statement issued Tuesday.
   He said the Lowell store, which needed major renovation, would
close on June 20. The Danbury store, which he said was becoming
less competitive in the market, was scheduled to close by July 15.
   Van Pelt said the 42 full-time and 40 part-time employees at the
Lowell store, and the 60 full-time and 69 part-time employees at
the Danbury store would be offered jobs at other Jordan Marsh
locations.
   Jordan Marsh, with 26 stores, is New England's largest
department store chain and employs about 10,000 people.
   Allen Questrom, chairman of Federated and Allied, issued a
statement saying that the retailers were reviewing each store's
profitability and determining which to close.
   ``We can reaffirm at this point, however, that we expect to
close only a small number of our 260 stores nationally as a direct
result of the ability to reject leases under Chapter 11,'' Questrom
said.
   He said that in the past two years Federated and Allied have
opened 12 stores in high-growth markets and closed 10 stores in
other areas.
   ``Store openings and closings are a normal part of the retail
business,'' Questrom said.
   ``The operations review process now underway is no different
from that of any other year, with one exception. Because this
year's review is being conducted under the auspices of Chapter 11,
we have the added ability to reject certain store leases that
otherwise would have bound us to lower-profit locations.''
   Questrom said decisions on store closings would be announced as
they are made.
   ``We have indicated from the outset of the Chapter 11 process
that we intend to take advantage of the additional flexibility
provided by the filing,'' he said. ``At this time, however, we have
no elaborate master plan or precise corporate timetable for doing
so.''

<HEAD>New Coke Anniversary Marked With Ads; Pepsi Signs Boxer in Coke's
Backyard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Coca-Cola Co. is marking the fifth
anniversary of New Coke with advertisements thanking consumers for
rejecting it.
   The full-page ad, scheduled to run Friday in seven major
newspapers, does not mention New Coke by name, but notes that five
years ago consumers responded to the arrival of the reformulated
drink by demanding the return of Coca-Cola's original formula.
   ``Five years ago, we learned what `back by popular demand' can
really mean,'' the ad says. New Coke was introduced on April 23,
1985.
   Meanwhile Wednesday, Pepsi-Cola Co. announced it has signed its
latest celebrity promoter in rival Coke's backyard: boxer Evander
Holyfield of Atlanta.
   Holyfield, heavyweight boxing's No. 1 contender, will
participate in various local promotions for Purchase, N.Y.-based
Pepsi, the first of which will provide tickets to sporting events
for youngsters who stay drug-free and have good school attendance.
   ``It allows us to really reach out into the community and
demonstrate our commitment to the Atlanta area,'' said Mark Smalls,
Pepsi's area marketing manager.
   After the consumer outcry greeted the introduction of New Coke,
the soft drink maker brought back original Coke under the brand
name Coca-Cola Classic that summer. It has regained the position of
the nation's best-selling soft drink, while New Coke has slipped
out of the Top 10.
   ``Some say that this was the best example of the wisdom and
power of the American consumer, and we certainly agree,'' says the
ad, which features a photograph of more than 3,000 Coke employees.
   ``That's why we gathered together all of The Coca-Cola Company
employees in Atlanta to salute you and thank you for telling us
exactly what you wanted,'' the ad says.
   Coke's ad will appear in The Wall Street Journal, USA Today, The
New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, The Chicago Tribune, The
Washington Post and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
   Industry analysts have said that by replacing original Coke with
the reformulated version, the company committed a major marketing
blunder. But the attention given to the consumer revolt and the
return of original Coke has been credited with helping to
revitalize the soft drink business.

<HEAD>Shearson Loses $915 Million; Merrill Earnings Up Slightly</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with Shearson earnings; no pickup</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said Wednesday it
lost $915 million in the first three months of 1990, the biggest
quarterly loss in Wall Street history.
   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. reported a 16 percent increase in
first-quarter profit despite lower revenue, as cost-cutting efforts
began to pay off for the nation's largest brokerage, which lost
money in 1989.
   The loss at Shearson, which the firm forecast two weeks ago, was
attributed to a $630 million charge against earnings to pay for a
restructuring that included thousands of layoffs and the
elimination or reduction of several businesses.
   The restructuring was implemented after parent American Express
Co. moved to seize tighter control of the nation's No. 2 investment
firm, which has struggled during a bad period on Wall Street
following broad expansion in the 1980s. American Express plans to
acquire all Shearson stock it does not own.
   Shearson also said it took a $157 million charge against
first-quarter earnings because of an accounting change in the way
it pays for development of computer software.
   Excluding the one-time charges, Shearson still lost $128 million
for the quarter.
   ``The first-quarter operating loss before the restructuring
charge stems from a slowdown in overall business activity and other
first-quarter 1990 events,'' Shearson said.
   The overall first quarter loss before the accounting change
equaled $8.75 per share. That compared to a loss of $15 million, or
24 cents a share, in the same 1989 period. Total revenue fell 15
percent to $2.6 billion from $3 billion a year earlier.
   Shearson said it increased litigation reserves by $50 million;
added $32 million to a loan loss reserve primarily related to the
portfolio of its Boston Co. subsidiary; and lost $34 million
because of fluctuations in the high-yield bond market.
   Shearson said it had $54 million in income related to the
settlement of litigation in connection with the suspension of
trading in tin by the London Metal Exchange in 1986.
   Merrill Lynch said it made $41.3 million, or 34 cents a share in
the first quarter, compared with $35.5 million, or 29 cents per
share, last year. Revenue declined to $2.66 billion from $2.79
billion.
   Commissions, principal transactions, insurance and asset
management and custodial fee revenue increased, while interest and
dividend, investment banking and other revenue declined.
   Merrill Lynch took a $470 million charge against earnings in the
previous quarter to pay for a major restructuring, which gave the
firm its first annual loss since going public in 1971. Merrill
plans to eliminate about 3,000 jobs by the end of 1990 and is
divesting some product lines and businesses.
   Merrill, Shearson and other Wall Street firms have been
struggling because of declines in stock market activity and key
businesses such as stock and bond underwriting and mergers and
takeovers since the 1987 stock market crash.
   ``We're saying that in these weak market conditions, firms that
generate profits are doing pretty well,'' said Jeffrey Bowman, who
follows the securities industry for Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.
   Merrill and Shearson reported lower investment banking revenue
as business remained sluggish in stock and bond underwriting and
merchant banking. Merrill's business fell 26.7 percent and
Shearson's 25 percent.
   Brokerage commission revenue was up 4.2 percent at Merrill, and
down 5.3 percent at Shearson.
   At Shearson, revenue from market-making and principal
transactions also fell sharply, attributed in part to volatility in
the collapsed junk bond market. Shearson is selling its portfolios
of junk bonds it holds for investment.
   Merrill Chairman William A. Schreyer said in a statement that he
expected a previously announced restructuring program, which
includes a cut through sharp staff reductions, to positively impact
earnings for the rest of the year.
   Merrill said quarterly expenses totaled $2.60 billion, down 5
percent from $2.73 billion reported in the 1989 period.

<HEAD>Seamen's Bank For Savings Insolvent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BETH J. HARPAZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Seamen's Bank for Savings, one of the city's
oldest banks, was declared insolvent and closed Wednesday by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Co., partly because of bad real estate
loans.
   Customers at the failed bank automatically became depositors at
The Chase Manhattan Bank, which assumed the $2.1 billion in
Seaman's accounts under an FDIC-backed agreement. All 13 branches
were expected to reopen Thursday as Chase branches.
   ``For the depositors, it will be business as usual,'' FDIC
spokesman Alan Whitney told a news conference in Manhattan.
   Next door, at a Wall Street branch of Seamen's, a steady stream
of people crowded around the bank's locked doors, reading notices
from the FDIC about the bank's insolvency and Chase's takeover.
   ``The ship is sinking, the ship is sinking,'' muttered one
elderly man as he hurried away after reading the signs.
   ``I know that it's protected, but still, you don't like to walk
by and see that sign in the window,'' said depositor Janet
Cullimane. ``I've got a lump in my throat.''
   Seamen's was chartered in 1829 to encourage saving by seamen and
others connected with the seafaring trade.
   ``The values of the assets were less than the values of the
liabilities,'' said Nick Ketcha, a FDIC regulations director.
``There were some poor investment decisions made.''
   He said a portion of the bank's portfolio was in loans in the
Southwest, primarily mortgage-backed securities. A number of banks
have experienced problems with loans made in that part of the
country, where the depression of oil prices has contributed to an
economic slowdown, including business failures and a soft
real-estate market.
   The last bank to fail in the city was First City National Bank,
which was closed down in December.

   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. said
Wednesday its first-quarter profit rose 12.5 percent, while MCI
Communications Corp. reported its first-quarter net income jumped
22 percent.
   Also Wednesday, BellSouth Corp., a regional phone company,
reported its first quarter earnings dropped nearly 6 percent.
   AT&amp;T said its profit for the quarter ended March 31 was boosted
by improved long-distance revenue and higher equipment sales.
   The company earned $668 million, or 62 cents a share, compared
with $594 million, or 55 cents a share, in the first three months
of 1989. Revenue totaled $8.89 billion, up 2.7 percent from $8.66
billion.
   Its operating income increased 21 percent, while costs and
expenses were about the same as during the last year's first
quarter, the company said.
   AT&amp;T, the nation's largest long-distance phone company, said its
long-distance volume rose nearly 7 percent in the quarter compared
with a year ago. Among the leading gainers were international calls
and specialized business services such as WATS lines and ``800''
toll-free lines, it said.
   Product sales increased 1.2 percent. Growth was shown in network
phone equipment and consumer phone products, while sales dropped
for some products, including small-business phone systems.
   The results were released in conjunction with the company's
annual shareholders meeting in Los Angeles.
   Charles Nichols, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.,
said AT&amp;T's earnings were a bit shy of Wall Street projections. He
said the earnings could have been hurt slightly by AT&amp;T's network
problems Jan. 15 that blocked millions of calls.
   AT&amp;T stock lost $1 to close at $41 a share Wednesday in the New
York Stock Exchange trading. Nichols said the drop probably was due
to the slightly lower-than-expected earnings and general softness
in the stock market.
   MCI, the nation's second-largest long distance company, said its
first-quarter profit totaled $156 million, or 62 cents a share,
compared with $128 million, or 51 cents a share, in the same period
of 1989.
   Revenue increased 20 percent to $1.8 billion from $1.5 billion,
said MCI, which is based in Washington, D.C.
   The results in last year's first quarter reflected a pre-tax
gain of $18 million from previously negotiated antitrust
settlements and an after-tax extraordinary charge of $10 million
for early debt retirement, MCI said.
   MCI's stock lost $1.62{ a share to close at $35.12{ in national
over-the-counter trading.
   Atlanta-based BellSouth reported its first-quarter earnings
totaled $423.2 million, or 88 cents a share, down from $449.6
million, or 97 cents a share, in the same period of 1989.Revenue
was $3.52 billion, up from $3.37 billion.
   Chairman John L. Clendenin blamed the profit drop in part on an
accounting change and BellSouth's acquisition of Mobile
Communications Corp. of America.
   The accounting change boosted 1989's first-quarter results by 15
cents a share, Clendenin said.
   Clendenin said 17.1 million shares that were purchased to
acquire MCCA were reissued. The reduced number of shares
outstanding in the first quarter of 1989 increased that quarter's
earnings per share by about 4 cents.

<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines creditors would receive 30
cents on the dollar under the latest reorganization proposal
offered by the airline's parent Texas Air Corp., Texas Air Chairman
Frank Lorenzo said Wednesday.
   Lorenzo _ in his first testimony yet before the bankruptcy court
supervising Eastern's reorganization _ spoke at a hearing over
unsecured creditors' request to remove him from control of Eastern
in favor of a court-appointed trustee.
   Eastern argues that putting an outsider in charge would hurt its
chances of financial recovery. The company has been attempting to
reach an agreement with the creditors to forestall such a move.
   Earlier, Eastern President Phil Bakes testified that appointment
of a trustee would spark employee departures, hurt business further
and heighten the chance Eastern eventually would have to be
liquidated.
   Lorenzo said that under a reorganization proposal made Monday,
unsecured creditors would get 30 cents on the dollar, about 20
percent of that in cash and the rest in securities. Creditors also
would get about 8 percent of Texas Air's stock.
   Creditors recently rejected an Eastern reorganization proposal
that would have paid them 27{ cents on the dollar, including 2{
cents cash and the rest in securities.
   Texas Air also would guarantee payment of the claims by year's
end, regardless of Eastern's condition at the time, if the
reorganization plan was not confirmed by Nov. 1, Lorenzo said.
   Furthermore, Texas Air would cover one half of Eastern's
projected losses through June 30, up to $40 million.
   ``Texas air would be totally responsible for the feasibility of
the corporation (Eastern),'' Lorenzo said.
   The proposal was conditioned on bankruptcy court approval of
Texas Air's previously announced sale of 50 percent of its System
One computerized reservations system to Electronic Data Systems
Corp. for $250 million.
   It also was conditioned on approval of Texas Air's payment of
$280 million to Eastern to settle potential claims raised by a
report by bankruptcy examiner David I. Shapiro. The report
suggested Texas Air had underpaid by hundreds of millions of
dollars for Eastern and some of its assets.
   In addition to the trustee request, Bankruptcy Judge Burton R.
Lifland is considering Eastern's request for $80 million from
escrow to finance its operations during the second quarter.
   Bakes said the money would be needed in the next week to 10
days, although sources close to Texas Air have said the company is
committed to covering Eastern's short-term expenses.
   The creditors, who are owed about $980 million, claim Eastern's
inability to make viable business projections and halt its
financial losses indicates current management should be replaced.
   But Bakes said putting a trustee in charge of Eastern would make
it tougher for the company to improve its performance, citing
earlier Eastern testimony that such a move would shake the
confidence of consumers and travel agents in the airline.
   ``I believe that there will be a much heightened risk of a
liquidation of the company, whether intended or not...'' Bakes said.
   Bakes also said many employees _ particularly in the
maintenance, engineering and flight operations areas _ would quit
their jobs if a trustee was appointed.
   Bakes conceded that Eastern had missed on many of its financial
projections, but said much of the airline industry experienced the
same uncertainty, especially in 1989.
   ``There's been a lot of negotiations, a lot of discussions ...
I'm not going to discuss it,'' Bakes told reporters earlier
Wednesday.
   Sources have said Texas Air also has agreed to possibly remove
some top managers in order to placate creditors.
   But Houston-based Texas Air issued a statement labeling as
``totally untrue'' rumors that Bakes' resignation had been offered
as a compromise to the creditors.
   ``We have made no proposals to creditors which would involve
Phil Bakes' replacement, nor is any such proposal planned,''
Lorenzo said in the statement. ``Phil and his team have done
admirably under very tough and trying circumstances.''
   The committee representing unsecured creditors asked Texas Air
several weeks ago to inject funds into Eastern. Texas Air's refusal
helped precipitate the creditors' request for Lifland to appoint a
trustee.
   Eastern has been reorganizing under bankruptcy court protection
since shortly after a March 1989 strike by its Machinists, pilots
and flight attendants. The company has operated on a much smaller
scale but has suffered from millions of dollars in business it lost
and has had trouble regaining since the strike.
   Bakes, who also is Eastern's chief executive officer, reviewed
in his court testimony the labor strife and financial losses that
marked his tenure.
   Bakes took the job at Eastern in October 1986, after Texas Air
acquired the carrier. Before that, he had been president of
Eastern's sister carrier Continental Airlines, which reorganized
under federal bankruptcy laws starting in 1982.
   Bakes also said there is considerable debate within Eastern's
ranks about the wisdom of the proposed sale of its prized South
American routes to rival American Airlines.
   On Tuesday, one top Eastern official resigned, apparently
motivated at least partly by the trustee issue. Eastern spokesman
Robin Matell said Tuesday that Jose Smith, the airline's senior
vice president of operations, had accepted a job at Coca-Cola Co.
   Smith, who has worked for Eastern for 23 years, could not be
reached for comment. But Bakes, asked by a reporter Wednesday about
Smith's departure, said his decision ``has something to do with
what is going on here, in this courtroom.''

<HEAD>First Interstate Net Off 4 Pct; Losses Staunched in Texas, Arizona</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First Interstate Bancorp said profits fell 4
percent in the first quarter but its troubled Texas unit turned a
$9.1 million profit and losses ended at its Arizona bank.
   First Interstate earned $127.2 million, or $2.23 a share, in the
first three months of the year compared with $132.2 million, or
$2.81 a share, a year earlier.
   Earnings per share declined sharply, reflecting the bank's issue
of 8.6 million new shares of common stock in February to replenish
its capital.
   First Interstate took a staggering $400 million in special
charges in December, mainly to cover losses at its Texas bank. Just
a few weeks earlier, it took a $350 million charge for
third-quarter losses in Arizona. It also began an accelerated
program to dump its troubled assets in Texas.
   Those moves resulted in a $124.5 million loss for all of 1989
and sent the bank's stock price tumbling. They also increased
speculation that First Interstate might become a takeover target
for a big healthy bank because of its $57 billion in assets and
sprawling system of offices in 21 states.
   The bank holding company's actions last year, particularly the
sell-off of bad loans in Texas, were beginning to pay off, Chairman
and Chief Executive Joseph J. Pinola said.
   ``Our Texas bank is reporting earnings, while our Arizona bank
is now slightly above break even and meeting our expectations,''
Pinola said.
   Excluding a one-time tax gain in 1989 and accounting changes,
operating earnings were $97.1 million for the latest quarter, up
from $94.3 million in the first quarter of 1989.
   Net interest income fell 8.7 percent to $581.6 million, largely
due to the sale of assets, First Interstate said.
   The net interest margin, the difference between what the bank
earns on its loans and what it pays depositors, increased to 4.76
percentage points in the latest quarter from 4.67 points in the
fourth quarter of 1989.
   Non-interest income fell 6 percent to $243.7 million in the
first quarter from $259.9 million in the 1989 period.
   Bad loans totaled $2.05 billion on March 31, down from $2.08
billion a year earlier and $2.11 billion at the end of 1989.
   ``While modest, this is the third quarter in which the level of
non-performing assets has been reduced,'' Pinola said.

<HEAD>Dollar Slides, Stock Prices Move Higher in Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar slid in early trading against the
Japanese yen Thursday and share prices moved sharply higher on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar started tradingdown 1.52 yen from
Wednesday's close of 159.87 yen. It finished at 158.12 yen in New
York overnight, down from 159.68 yen on Tuesday.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 402.96
poin at 158.35 yen, ts, or 1.37 percent, shortly after the market opened
to move to
29,652.02. The index gained 787.46 points Wednesday.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's slide followed its downswing
in New York Wednesday, despite a report of a sharp improvement in
the U.S. merchandise trade figures for February.
   The U.S. Commerce Department said the nation's trade deficit
narrowed in February to a six-year low of $6.49 billion from a
revised $9.32 billion deficit in January.
  ng like
those of the past, when young workers were housed in unheated
concrete buildings, often four or five to a room, and enthusiastic
supervisors tried to instill company values of group living and
personal sacrifice.
   Such privation is no longer tolerated by Japanese who have grown
up in comfort. Major corporations also are taking on a greater role
as landlords as workers demand more help to cope with housing costs
shooting up much faster than average pay levels.
   In a recent Economic Planning Agency survey of 1,781 of Japan's
largest firms, 51.3 percent of the 1,211 that responded said they
intended to remodel or build new dormitories for unmarried
employees in the next three years.
   Watabe, who has worked three years for Sumitomo Corp., a trading
company, has a carpeted, furnished 140 square-foot room with
heating and cooling.
   The $50 monthly rent is about one-tenth the cost of similar
rooms in the neighborhood. Moreover, those rooms don't offer some
of the other features of his dormitory _ a deep, hot Japanese bath
ready at all times, a billiards room, an outdoor tennis court and a
cafeteria with steak on the menu.
   To meet demands for greater privacy and comfort, Nissan Motor
Corp. remodeled a university dormitory outside Yokohama for the
staff of its main research facility, the Nissan Technical Center.
   The brick, seven-story ``Parc Vert Nissan'' overlooks a verdant
country club. Each of the 165 men and women residents has a single
room furnished with bed, desk, dressers and bathroom.
   They can use a large kitchen, computer room, garden patio and
``karaoke'' equipment, a popular entertainment system with recorded
musical accompaniment for amateur singers, who croon into the
attached microphone.
   Company dorms formerly were meant to house bachelors or young
families temporarily while they saved enough to buy homes.
Employers structured income scales and benefit policies to permit
home purchases just as workers were starting families and facing
greater costs.
   Now, however, Asahi Mutual Life Insurance Co. has calculated
that if Tokyo-area land prices continue rising at their average
annual rate of the last 15 years, 9.6 percent, a 20-year-old today
will not be able afford to buy a one-room apartment before he
becomes 40.
   This has led to a profound shift in company benefit plans.
   In the Economic Planning Agency survey, the number of companies
that said they intended to build new company housing rose by 17.9
percent from last year. But those planning to increase housing
allowances decreased by 11.9 percent and those planning to extend
low-interest loans for mortgages fell by 8.9 percent.
   Toshiya Yamamoto, manager of Nissan's employee welfare section,
said his company's compensation system still is aimed at enabling a
worker to buy an apartment of comfortable size within 90 minutes'
commute by age 35. But Yamamoto acknowledged that Nissan's
assistance _ $233,000 in low-interest loans _ is insufficient to
buy a home.
   Under such conditions, workers are staying in company housing
even after marriage. At companies that lack housing, particularly
foreign firms, Japanese are increasingly pressing their employers
to acquire it.
   Yamamoto said that in erecting new housing, ``we first consider
who among our staff is in greatest need and we devise a system to
fit their needs.''
   Luring new recruits ``by creating beautiful showpieces'' is not
an aim of company housing policy, he said.
   Nevertheless, recruiting specialists say that among the growing
number of Japanese changing jobs, the housing question is becoming
more important in choosing new employers.
   Watabe, employed in Sumitomo's personnel division, said many
college students looking into future employment ask about housing
conditions.
   Watabe said he probably won't start thinking about whether to
buy a home until he gets married. Standing on the artificial turf
of his dorm's tennis court, he pointed to his feet.
   ``If I wanted to buy land right now, all I could get would be
the land I'm standing on,'' he said.

<HEAD>Apple Reports 134 Percent Jump In Second-Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Apple Computer Inc. said lower
component costs, success of new products and improved overseas
sales helped it more than double earnings in the three months ended
March 30.
   The world's No. 2 personal computer maker said Wednesday that
net income for its fiscal second quarter was $131.8 million, or
$1.04 a share, compared with $56.4 million, or 44 cents a share, a
year earlier.
   Revenues rose 8 percent to $1.35 billion from $1.25 billion.
   ``It was a very good report by any standard. It was way at the
far end of anyone's expectations,'' said Steven Ossad, an analyst
with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco.
   John Sculley, Apple's chairman and chief executive officer, said
the company was enjoying lower component costs and strong sales of
computers introduced last year.
   International sales also rose, representing 47 percent of net
sales during the latest quarter compared with 40 percent for the
same period a year ago.
   ``During the quarter the percentage of revenues coming from
outside the United States reached an all-time high,'' Sculley said
in a statement.
   For the first six months of the fiscal year, earnings rose 30
percent to $256.7 million, or $2 a share, from $196.8 million, or
$1.54 a share a year ago. Revenues rose 7 percent to $2.84 billion
from $2.65 billion.
   Despite the quarter's ``staggering'' performance, the company
was correct to be cautious in its forecast for the second half of
1990, Ossad said. Apple told analysts it was unlikely it would
achieve 10 percent growth in the second half, he added.
   Apple needs to increase the number of less expensive products,
particularly in light of the growing demand for computers among
consumers and schools, Ossad said.

<HEAD>Northrop Net Up 900 Pct Due to Sale of Headquarters Buildings,</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   B-2 bomber builder Northrop Corp. said its
earnings rose nearly nine-fold in the first quarter, mostly
reflecting a profit on the sale of its headquarters in Century City.
   For the three months ended March 31, Northrop earned $96
million, or $2.04 a share, compared with $9.7 million, or 21 cents
a share, in the same period last year. Sales were unchanged at
$1.28 billion.
   Excluding the gain on the sale of the headquarters, Northrop
said it would have earned $28.9 million, or 62 cents a share.
   The aerospace company said a slight increase in aircraft sales
offset a small decrease in its missiles and unmanned vehicles
business.
   Northrop's order backlog was $5.7 billion, up 24 percent from
$4.6 billion a year earlier.
   The first-quarter earnings included $67.1 million from the sale
of the headquarters complex. The balance of the after-tax gain on
the sale, $22.8 million, will be amortized over the 10-year life of
the lease under which Northrop remains in the same offices.

<HEAD>Supercomputer Maker Reports $12.4 Million Net Loss For First
Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cray Computer Corp. said it lost
$12.4 million in the first quarter because of expected equipment
and construction costs for the development of its Cray-3
supercomputer.
   The loss amounted to 73 cents a share.
   Neil Davenport, president and chief executive officer, said
Wednesday the latest loss was expected.
   ``During the first quarter of 1990 we completed the acquisition
of certain machinery and equipment and process technology from
GigaBit Logic Inc., which will allow us to manufacture our own GaAs
circuits,'' he said.
   ``We also commenced construction of a 40,000-square-foot
addition to our existing facility to house the GaAs foundry, which
is expected to be completed in July 1990,'' said Davenport.
   Cray Computer was spun off last November from Cray Research
Inc., the nation's largest supercomputer maker, to develop founder
Seymour Cray's planned Cray-3.

<HEAD>Air Force Agrees to Pay up to $27 Million in Hazardous Waste
Cleanup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force has agreed to pay as much as $27
million of the cleanup costs at two hazardous waste dump sites used
by The Boeing Co., court papers revealed.
   In a deposition taken for a lawsuit between Boeing and its
insurers, Stephen Trautwein, a local Air Force contract manager,
said the cleanup was considered part of ``ordinary and necessary
business costs.''
   Trautwein said the cleanup costs at the two sites _ Western
Processing in Kent and Queen City Farms in Maple Valley _ were
negotiated as a separate item between Boeing and Air Force contract
officers.
   A Pentagon spokesman in Washington, D.C., told the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer Tuesday that ``it is not standard procedure''
for the Defense Department to reimburse a contractor for hazardous
waste cleanup costs.
   However, a spokeswoman at the Air Force Contract Management
Division in Albuquerque, N.M., said the Air Force agreed to pay a
portion of the costs at the two sites because the service
considered the cleanups ``necessary and normal business expenses.''
   A Boeing spokesman said, ``in general, those costs are
recognized as usual and accepted costs of doing business. It was
something we worked out with the Air Force,'' the
Post-Intelligencer reported, without naming its sources.
   Boeing dumped about 24 million gallons of hazardous waste at the
sites between 1957 and 1977. The company has estimated the cost of
cleanup at more than $80 million.
   Boeing signed a consent agreement with the Environmental
Protection Agency to pay most of the cleanup costs after the EPA
closed the two sites in the early 1980s.
   Boeing already has spent about $40 million to clean up the
sites, but it was not known whether that amount included Air Force
funds, the Post-Intelligencer reported.
   A federal judge ruled this week that a jury will have to decide
whether Boeing must pay for the cleanups or if it can pass the
costs on to its insurers.
   The insurers claim Boeing is liable because their policies were
designed to cover cleanups from accidents. They introduced evidence
in federal court last week indicating the company failed to heed
warnings made as early as the 1950s that its dumping would cause
pollution at the two sites.
   Boeing has maintained that it did not knowingly pollute the two
sites.
   Boeing has told its insurers it could be liable for cleanups in
13 other toxic waste dumps sites around the United States. Those
sites include several that contain waste from its military work.

   A new round of increases in interest rates
helped push stock prices broadly lower Wednesday as Wall Street
registered little enthusiasm over the latest news on the nation's
international trade balance.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials tumbled 32.89 points to
2,732.88, giving back nearly all of its 36.04-point gain over the
three previous sessions.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
477 up, 1,056 down and 473 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 147.13 million
shares, up from 127.99 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 179.79 million shares.
   The Commerce Department reported that the U.S. trade deficit in
February shrank to its narrowest reading in more than six years.
Imports exceeded exports by $6.49 billion, down from $9.32 billion
in January.
   Analysts said that held out the prospect of
stronger-than-expected growth in economic output, and improved
profits at many companies with a substantial international business.
   At the same time, however, it touched off fresh worries about
the outlook for interest rates.
   In the credit markets prices of long-term government bonds fell
more than $10 for each $1,000 in face value, increasing their
yields to the 8.82 percent-8.88 percent range.
   Merck &amp; Co. rose | to 74&rsqb;. The company reported first-quarter
earnings of $1.03 a share, up from 86 cents in the comparable
period last year.
   Losers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, down 1\ at 109~; General Electric, down { at 66&rsqb;; DuPont,
down 1 at 38{; Procter &amp; Gamble, down 1&lsqb; at 70\, and American
Express, down &rsqb; at 28~.
   Polaroid fell 1} to 43}. On Tuesday the company reported higher
first-quarter earnings, but the results fell short of advance
estimates.
   In addition, Polaroid said it had scaled back its expectations
for the full year, citing sluggish economic conditions.
   Japanese issues traded in this country gained ground on the
heels of a rally in the Tokyo stock market. TDK climbed 3\ to 43{;
Matsushita Electrical 3&rsqb; to 138&rsqb;; Kyocera 1 to 92, and Honda Motor
&rsqb; to 22~.
   Precious-metals stocks also advanced. Newmont Gold rose 2 to
42&lsqb;; Homestake Mining 1 to 17}; ASA Ltd. 2&lsqb; to 51~, and Hecla
Mining \ to 13|.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $33.06 billion, or 1.00
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 1.98 to 186.93.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 4.48 to 395.81, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 3.96 at 340.72.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
slumped 3.90 to 431.90. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 353.22, down 1.50.
