<HEAD>Eagles Rebuild Nests Destroyed During Hugo</HEAD>

   Most of the bald eagles that lost their
nests when Hurricane Hugo swept through South Carolina last fall
have rebuilt their homes, a wildlife expert said.
   Eighteen of 24 eagle pairs whose nests were destroyed have
rebuilt them, nearly all near their old nests. Thirty other eagles'
nests remained intact after the hurricane.
   But Tom Murphy, an eagle specialist with the state Wildlife and
Marine Resources Department, said that some of the trees in which
nests lie ``are not very good nest trees. We're a little concerned
that some of the nests might fall before incubation and chick
rearing is over.''
   Bald eagles, an endangered species in the state, nest here
during the winter. A pair mates for life and establishes a
territory for nesting.
   The bald eagle has shown promising progress in South Carolina.
In 1976, Murphy located 13 occupied nests; last year he counted 52.

<HEAD>Boston Police Officers Indicted For Alleged Conspiracy In Lewin
Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A special grand jury on Thursday indicted two city
police officers on charges they conspired to cover up and
misrepresent events surrounding a soured drug raid in which a
detective was shot to death.
   The charges against Detective Carlos A. Luna and Sgt. Hugo R.
Amate _ including perjury, consiracy and filing false reports _
were the latest setback for police, who have been blasted for their
handling of the Charles Stuart murder case.
   The fatal Feb. 17, 1988, shooting of Detective Sherman Griffith
in the drug raid resulted in Albert Lewin being charged.
   But a state judge dismissed the case after the elite anti-drug
squad failed to produce the informant it claimed led officers to
the apartment where the shooting took place. The Supreme Judicial
Court later voted 4-2 to reinstate the charges.
   On Thursday, the Suffolk County grand jury handed up 13
indictments against Luna and Amate following an investigation by
Attorney General James M. Shannon's criminal bureau.
   If convicted of all charges, the veteran officers face more than
20 years in prison, according to Shannon's spokeswoman, Mary
Breslauer. Luna and Amate are to be arraigned March 5 in Suffolk
County Superior Court.
   The indictment alleges that Luna and Amate agreed to carry out a
cover-up in the Lewin case through perjury and by filing false
reports, Shannon said in a statement.
   Luna, testifying last month at a Superior Court hearing on a
motion to dismiss charges against Lewin, said the 2{-year-old web
of lies grew from the first affidavit used to obtain a search
warrant for the raid.
   Luna said Assistant District Attorney Francis O'Meara and his
police superiors were told the informant used to obtain the search
warrant was fictitious, but conspired to cover it up to bring Lewin
to trial.
   According to the affidavit detectives filed to obtain the search
warrant, an informant named John told him a 5-foot, 6-inch Hispanic
drug dealer named Stevie was selling cocaine from the apartment.
   From the start, a key hole in the prosecution's case was that
Lewin, who is 6-foot-2 and Jamaican, didn't fit the description.
That discrepancy led the defense to ask that the informant be
produced.
   Luna was charged Thursday with filing false police reports
within a month of the search-warrant affidavit and two counts of
perjury for testimony during a March 9, 1988 probable cause hearing
in the case against Lewin.
   He also faces 14 charges of filing false police reports between
Sept. 27 and Nov. 25, 1988, that detailed efforts to locate the
fictitious informant, and 10 separate counts of perjury in December
1988 testimony in the Lewin case.
   Amate, who was part of Luna's drug squad, was charged with being
an accessory after the fact in Luna's alleged perjury in the 1988
search warrant affidavit.
   The indictment charges that Amate, knowing that Luna falsely
sworn to facts in the affidavit, helped Luna try to avoid being
arrested, Shannon's statement said.
   Amate was also charged with filing a false police report and
committing perjury at a December 1988 hearing on the Lewin case.
   In the Stuart case, investigators believe Stuart killed his
pregnant wife, Carol, then shot himself in the stomach last October.
   Police initially believed Stuart's account that he and his wife
were shot by a black man. Following an intensive manhunt, police
picked up William Bennett, who is black, and identified him as the
prime suspect.
   Stuart apparently jumped to his death from a Boston bridge on
Jan. 4, the same day police identified him as a suspect. Police
have since been accused of racism in their hunt for a black suspect.

<HEAD>Human Testing Begins for Muscular Dystrophy Research</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Researchers hope they have found a way to
treat muscular dystrophy by altering the genetic makeup of weakened
muscles.
   Scientists injected donor cells into the foot of a 9-year-old
muscular dystrophy patient at the University of Tennessee on
Thursday, testing a procedure called a myoblast transfer which may
lead to medical treatments of genetically based diseases.
   Leon Charash, a New York child neurologist with the Muscular
Dystrophy Association, said it apparently was the first time cells
have been injected into living human tissue in hopes they would
blend with dystrophic cells and restore them to normal.
   ``If I were the family of this child and the thousands like him,
I would be heartened by this,'' Charash said. ``I think it is the
opening salvo to what's going to happen in the 1990s, which I hope
is going to be the successful treatment of many genetic disorders.''
   ``I've treated children with this illness for 30 years and
people always ask what they can look forward to. Every one of these
children die so you tell them you never know what science and
research is going to do,'' said Charash, chairman of the
association's national medical advisory committee.
   Scientists at the University of Tennessee-Memphis have selected
11 young boys suffering from Duchenne muscular dystrophy as test
subjects.
   On Thursday, doctors injected healthy, immature muscle cells _
called myoblasts _ into a small muscle in one of the feet of Sam
Looper, a fourth-grader from Pickens, S.C.
   The injected muscle will be examined in 90 days to see if it is
growing stronger and if its cells are producing a protein called
dystrophin, which is missing in muscle cells of Duchenne sufferers.
If Looper's body accepts the cell injection, work will proceed with
other test subjects.
   Similar tests are scheduled this year in San Francisco, Boston
and Montreal. Previous tests have been conducted only on laboratory
animals.
   The research could lead within a year or two to medical
treatments for improving and prolonging the lives of muscular
dystrophy patients, said Gerald Golden, director of the
university's Center for Developmental Disabilities.
   By strengthening a few large muscles doctors may be able to keep
a muscular dystrophy patient walking or breathing on his own for
years longer than otherwise expected, he said.
   Sufferers of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a genetic disease that
generally affects only boys, rarely live past their 20s and are
often confined to wheelchairs for much of their lives.
   The Tennessee research stems from laboratory work on mice
conducted by Peter Law, a professor of neurology who first
published his theories on myoblast transfer in 1978.
   ``It will not only prevent the (abnormal) cells from
degenerating, but it also will replenish lost cells,'' Law said.
   To get donor cells for Looper's injections, doctors slightly
injured a shoulder muscle of his father, Larry, causing it to
produce myoblasts. A piece of the muscle was surgically removed and
the immature cells were multiplied in the laboratory.

   The first private political magazine
in Communist Yugoslavia appeared on newsstands and reports said the
government also plans to allow private radio and TV stations to
open.
   The 24-page first issue of Samouprava, released Thursday, dealt
mainly with Yugoslavia's economic and political crisis and included
an editorial by dissident Milovan Djilas.
   The editorial blamed the Communist Party for leading the country
into the crisis.
   Samouprava, a monthly with a circulation of about 10,000 copies,
is printed in Novi Sad, capital of northern Vojvodina province.
   A newspaper with the same name began during the prewar monarchy,
but when the Communists came to power immediately after the war,
the newspaper ceased to exist.
   ``Samouprava is not a party or a government organ and its pages
will be open to all parties and any government,'' said chief editor
Sinisa Nikolic.
   Yugoslavia is changing its constitution, legalizing a multiparty
system and preparing for its first free elections in 50 years in
April.
   The reform-minded government of Premier Ante Markovic said
Wednesday it will amend federal laws on public information by June,
allowing private radio and TV stations to operate.
   ``Everyone will be able to freely establish newspapers, radio
and television stations,'' said Information Secretary Darko Marin,
according to news reports Thursday.

<HEAD>Times Change For Man Who Arrested Havel</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Friday AMs report.</NOTE>
<HEAD>By ALISON SMALE</HEAD>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Times have changed for Petr Zak, a
former secret police major.
   Just 13 months ago Zak arrested dissident Vaclav Havel. Now,
Havel is president and Zak sits disconsolately at home under what
he calls virtual house arrest.
   Like the thousands of others who toiled for the dreaded STB, the
Czech acronym for the now disbanded secret police, Zak is under
orders to stay home while an Interior Ministry commission mulls his
fate.
   In keeping with the philosophy of love and dignity preached by
President Havel, it's a mild punishment for years of repression Zak
helped carry out under the Communist government.
   The routine leaves Zak and countless other former functionaries
across Eastern Europe hours to ponder the fate that has wrenched
power from their hands.
   A year ago the burly, balding Zak confidently rasped out
testimony that sent Havel to jail for four months on charges of
obstructing a police official. In an interview with The Associated
Press, Zak seemed deflated.
   Seated in his neat apartment in a shabby block on the outskirts
of Prague, he groped to describe the change that has torn him from
the 20 years of intelligence work he clearly relished.
   ``It was a bit of a shock,'' he finally conceded during an
hour-long interview.
   When unrest broke out after the Nov. 17 police attack on
peaceful students, ``some official structures did not act at all,
some went beyond their authority _ and the result was what
happened,'' he said.
   As head of a 30-member department dealing with what he calls
``extremism in independent initiatives,'' Zak was among those who
best knew Havel, Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier and an array of
other dissidents catapulted by revolution into positions of power.
   In his classic Bolshevik ``we lost-they won'' view, this
transformation was less surprising for Zak than for a startled
world watching Czechoslovakia's rapid makeover.
   He had long gathered information by interrogating the
dissidents, listening to informers _ who he insists were unpaid _
and conducting surveillance easily observed by every visitor to
dissidents' homes.
   Zak claimed the dissidents long ago drew up a ``schedule'' of
events for 1989 that foresaw the eventual assumption of power. And
he's sure things wouldn't have happened so fast without ``certain
international support'' for his opponents.
   There were a few mistakes on the Communists' side, too, he
admitted. One was a failure publicly to acknowledge, or perhaps
even play upon, differences between the various dissident groups;
another was that ``we were forced more and more to carry out
preventive measures, and not our own intelligence work.''
   It was during these ``preventive measures'' _ the only term Zak
used to describe detention or interrogation _ that he spent hours
in discussion with Havel, Dienstbier and others, puffing on
``Petra'' cigarettes, the cheap brand smoked by all three men.
   ``If they had something constructive to say, or something I
didn't know before, I was ready to accept, or tolerate it,'' Zak
said.
   Why then was no public action taken to open dialogue with the
dissidents? ``Ask the politicians,'' Zak replied.
   Zak believes the Communists should and will play a significant
role in Czechoslovakia. He refused to talk about differences among
the former leaders over what to do about the dissidents, saying
only that four groups fought for control.
   Equally loyally, he refused to criticize the decision on Jan.
16, 1989 to arrest Havel. Zak was one of those who detained the
playwright after a small demonstration on Wenceslas Square, which
Havel observed without taking part.
   The arrest finally drove thousands of intellectuals who had
refused to side openly with the dissidents into signing petitions
for Havel's release.
   It was the start of a revolt that moved with furious pace after
Nov. 17.
   Many former Communist functionaries have found th changes
unbearable.
   At least six people closely associated with the old rulers,
including two policemen and former Slovak Communist leader Viliam
Salgovic, long reputed to be a KGB agent, have committed suicide
since the revolution.
   Scattered reports in state media indicate many Communists are
being fired and finding it hard to get work at even the most menial
tasks.
   Zak said his children met some resentment at school ``when they
refused to join in certain actions'' of protest of the authorities.
   ``And I suppose,'' he said, ``I was also punished by what is
happening to me.''

<HEAD>Scott Thomson Ends 10-year Reign Over Principals
^Eds: Also in Friday AMs report.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was clear to Scott Thomson 38 years ago _
long before television, designer clothes and after-school jobs
began to claim the attention of American youngsters _ that the
United States was losing ground in education.
   Thomson, who this weekend ends his 10-year reign as head of the
nation's largest association of school administrators, says some of
that ground has been regained but much remains to be done.
   ``We've become so entertainment-oriented that we've forgotten
that education is the main course and entertainment is the
dessert,'' he said.
   ``I see happening now what I had hoped would have happened in
the '60s and '70s _ that is placing education at a higher priority
in the public mind.''
   Thomson, who as executive director of the National Association
of Secondary School Principals, boosted membership in the
organization from 33,000 to 42,000, says he's had some successes
during his tenure but admits he still feels some frustrations.
   ``I think I was much too ambitious to think I could have any
kind of impact on the entire nation,'' he said in a recent
interview. ``I've tried to do individually what I could to improve
schools and raise standards and get everybody involved in
learning.''
   Thomson, 61, said he foresaw U.S. education problems after being
in Singapore on a Rotary Foundation scholarship in 1952-53.
   ``I was so impressed with the commitment that Singapore was
making to education. They were spending time and money _ all of
society. ... (Education) was the No. 1 priority.''
   Thomson said he and his wife, a teacher, realized then ``how
much trouble the United States was going to be in eventually if our
kids had to compete against those kids who were burning up the
track with their effort and attitude.''
   ``They were simply working harder and accomplishing more back in
the 1950s, than our kids were, before we thought we had a problem.''
   Today, Thomson points to the academic achievements of students
in Singapore and other Asian nations. Reports show U.S. students
falling behind other industrialized nations academically,
particularly in math and science.
   ``There is no question that education pays off,'' he said.
   As head of the association, which begins its meeting Friday in
San Diego, Thomson has warned of the negative impact the job market
and television industry were having on learning in America.
   ``A high demand for cheap labor and a premium on teen-age
consumption lure students into the job market,'' said Thomson, who
concluded after comparing the learning conditions in South Korea
and West Germany with those in the United States that ``American
society doesn't measure up.''
   Thomson said surveys show a large percentage of U.S. high school
students work, some as much as 20 hours or more a week.
   In South Korea, students ``simply do not hold jobs while
attending school,'' and West Germany students aren't employed
through all 13 years of school.
   He said 71 percent of 13-year-old Korean students consistently
watch science programs, while only 37 percent of Americans of
similar age watch such programs.
   Thomson also tackled the issue of product advertising in the
classroom, aiming most of his criticism at Whittle Communications
Corp., which has offered schools a daily 10-minute news show with
two minutes of advertising. The schools receive free television
monitors in return.
   ``We're very much opposed to `Channel One' because we don't
think the classroom setting is the proper place to buy Levis or
candy, whatever,'' he said.
   Thomson will continue his work with education, in March becoming
executive secretary of the National Policy Board for Educational
Administration, the only national group studying preparation and
certification programs for school administrators.
   The board plans to have a framework for preparation programs
developed by June 1991 and launch a national certification board
early in 1992.
   Thomson also will be a research professor at George Mason
University in Fairfax, Va., heading another project on preparation
programs for school principals.

<TEXT>
   Homosexual literature, long confined to the back
corners of bookstores, has come out of the closet with the
emergence of AIDS. Today, more than 200 titles involving AIDS have
given the gay lifestyle broad exposure.
   ``There's been an explosion of these books,'' said David Groff,
an editor at Crown Publishing in New York. ``AIDS is the most real
and potent metaphor for everything now. It involves every issue of
life and death and love.''
   Most of the books revolve around those universal themes, and the
hardship of living under the threat of a modern-day plague. Because
AIDS has pervaded the homosexual world, almost all current gay
literature touches on the subject.
   Homosexual or bisexual men account for 60 percent of the cases
of acquired immuned deficiency syndrome reported in the United
States since 1981.
   The biggest seller among AIDS-oriented books is still Randy
Shilts 1987 chronicle of the AIDS epidemic, ``And the Band Played
On.'' But novels or memoirs involving AIDS have become critical and
financial successes.
   Armistead Maupin's ``Sure of You,'' a fictional account about a
troubled married couple and the husband's gay business partner, was
on The New York Times bestseller list in December. Paul Monette's
1988 book ``Borrowed Time,'' a biography of the author's lover, who
died of AIDS, was nominated for a National Book Critics Circle
Award.
   Robert Ferro's 1988 novel, ``Second Son,'' the story of two men
with AIDS who become lovers, sold tens of thousands of copies.
   As a result, customers browsing through major mainstream
bookstores such as Buddenbrooks in Boston come upon two shelves of
gay-oriented books displayed prominently.
   The irony of the new legitimacy surrounding such books is not
lost on sellers of homosexual literature.
   ``AIDS has brought the gay lifestyle into the mainstream but I
think it's sad that it's taken something like this to do it,'' said
Buzz Bryan, editor of the Lambda Book Report in Washington, which
is associated with Lambda Rising, one of the nation's largest gay
bookstores.
   Before the emergence of AIDS in 1981, most bookstores would not
have considered displaying novels dealing solely, and intimately,
with gay life on the same shelves as mainstream fiction.
   Sasha Alyson, owner of Alyson Publishing, a small gay book house
in Boston, said his imprint was the first to issue a book touching
on AIDS. Called ``The Advocate's Guide to Gay Health,'' the 1982
book had almost gone to press when a chapter on AIDS was added.
   Since then, Alyson said, unsolicited AIDS memoirs have flooded
his office.
   ``A lot of them are very good and it's hard to turn them down,''
Alyson said. ``Especially the ones written by parents.''
   A free book called ``You Can Do Something About AIDS'' was
published by Alyson two years ago. It is a collection of essays,
many by celebrities such as Elizabeth Taylor, and over a million
copies have been distributed at bookstores.
   Michael Denneny, senior editor at St. Martin's Press in New
York, said he believes AIDS was the final step in the public's
acceptance of homosexuality. The proliferation of AIDS-related
books was a natural progression, he said.
   ``It was already happening somewhat with gay books hitting the
mainstream,''he said. ``Now bookstores are more willing to accept
them.''
   Denneny also credits a new candor about homosexuality among
publishing houses. Groff and Denneny are the founding members of
the Publishing Triangle, a 700-member group of gay and lesbian
editors in the publishing industry.
   ``Ten years ago, only three of us identified ourselves as gay,''
said Denneny. ``When we formed the Triangle, I was flabbergasted to
find out how many people joined.''

   Put down that Perrier and lime _ the '80s are
over.
   Yeah, we know that you were bored to tears by a googolplex of
decade-ending stories just two months ago. Yeah, we know that
decades are arbitrary guideposts, that by one count the decade
doesn't begin until next January.
   But bar with us. It's official. The '80s are history.
   An inkling that we have entered the 1990s came when the parting
of Donald and Ivana Trump edged Nelson Mandela off the front page.
   Many readers asked the news media: ``Why are you so obsessed
with these people whose main interest in life, it seems, is
flaunting the gold-plated faucets on their yacht? Is this some sort
of Trump fetish?''
   No. No less than William Norwich, society columnist for the
Daily News, explains that the Trumps deserve wall-to-wall coverage
because they were ``the couple of the '80s,'' a title they appear
to have won by acclamation.
   The couple of the '80s is no more. Ergo, the '80s are over.
   Cecilia Briones, a New York banker, sees parallels between the
rise and fall of the Trumps and the course of Wall Street in the
'80s: ``Everything went up and everything has to come down.''
   Still not convinced? Go down to your local boite and try to
order a Perrier. The fizzy drink of the 1980s _ a beverage that
supplanted the lowly club soda as the pause that refreshed the
ostentatious; nearly 30 million gallons were guzzled in the United
States in 1988 alone _ has been recalled in every one of the 120
countries where it was distributed.
   The culprit was benzene contamination. No matter. No Perrier; no
'80s.
   ``I'll just replace it. I'll suffer with Evian,'' said Astrid
Sanai, a paralegal at a Manhattan law firm.
   She and other health-conscious citizens of the 1980s have other
reasons to be bummed to the max, a phrase that never saw the end of
the decade.
   Oat bran was the cholesterol eliminator of the 1980s; in recent
weeks, scientists have said that this unappetizing foodstuff may
protect the heart, but only if it crowds eggs, red meat and ice
cream out of your diet, not because it has some inherent
anti-cholesterol qualities.
   The running, gravity boots and aerobics that marked the 1980s
may have been on borrowed time, anyway. The TV star of the 1990s,
Roseanne Barr, and her co-star John Goodman represent a new wave of
corpulence.
   Corporate fat cats, meanwhile, are on the outs. In whatever
portion of the paper that was not devoted to reports of the Trump
breakup, you may have read this week about the sudden downfall of
Drexel Burnham Lambert, the Wall Street upstart that pioneered the
use of junk bonds for corporate takeovers.
   It was Drexel Burnham _ and its executive Michael R. Milken, who
is under indictment _ that came to epitomize greed in the 1980s.
These seltzer-swilling financiers _ one brokerage worker called
Perrier ``the drink of Drexel'' _ joined with corporate gamblers to
take over healthy companies, fueled by piles of high-risk IOUs and
dreams of enormous profits.
   A lot of these enterprises have gone down the tubes.
Bloomingdale's, the department store of the 1980s, was caught in
the declining fortunes of Canadian investor Robert Campeau.
Discount sales at Bloomie's? Adolfo at 40 percent off? The trendy
shoppers of the '80s weep.
   Adolfo's most famous client in recent years, size-4 Nancy
Reagan, has been replaced by the larger, less fashion-oriented
Barbara Bush. We need not remind you who George Bush replaced.
   But it should be noted that the former two-term president of the
United States _ the man who dubbed the Soviet Union the ``evil
empire,'' another concept that didn't make it into the 1990s _ was
ordered to sit in a Los Angeles courtroom on Friday and answer
questions about the Iran-Contra case.
   The '80s have ended _ not with a bang, not with a whimper. Not
even with a fizz.

   Four convicts have been released in less than a
year by the courts or new evidence, leading some attorneys to
question how many more inmates may have been wrongly convicted in
Dallas.
   But prosecutors and court watchers say the chances of that
happening in Dallas are no worse than anywhere else _ it's the
price one pays for justice.
   ``We handle about 25,000 felony cases a year, and I'm sure that
some mistakes are made,'' Norman Kinne, first assistant district
attorney in Dallas County, said Thursday. ``I think the importance
of it is not that mistakes are made but that we do everything to
rectify them once it's brought to our attention.''
   Two inmates gained their freedom in just the last week; another
learned she would not be retried. The fourth, Randall Dale Adams,
was within days of being executed for killing a Dallas police
officer before his sentenced was commuted in 1980 to life in
prison. He was released last March.
   ``The question in my mind is, how many more are out there?''
asked Joe Cook, president of the American Civil Liberties Union in
Dallas. ``It's bothersome to me because it could happen to you, to
me, or anyone else out there for that matter.''
   On Wednesday, prosecutors asked a judge to dismiss aggravated
robbery charges against Joyce Ann Brown, 42, who was released last
November after nine years in prison for a jewelry store robbery.
The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals overturned the conviction,
ruling that prosecutors should have known and should have told
defense attorneys that a key witness against Ms. Brown had been
previously convicted for lying to police.
   Also Wednesday, Gov. Bill Clements signed a full pardon for
Michael Anthony Woten, 36, who spent eight years in prison for a
grocery store robbery. Authorities sought the pardon after the
Dallas Times Herald located his alibi witness. Another man has
since admitted the crime.
   Last Friday, a judge released Martin Kimsey, a 49-year-old Waco
man who spent five years in prison before a federal prisoner came
forward and took responsibility for a robbery Kimsey was convicted
of committing.
   Perhaps the most celebrated case was that of Adams, an Ohio man
who spent 12-years behind bars for the 1976 shooting death of a
police officer. A state appeals court overturned the conviction and
authorities chose not to seek a new trial. Much of the credit for
Adams' release went to the film, ``The Thin Blue Line,'' which
detailed the case and alleged misconduct by prosecutors.
   Before Adams came Lenell Geter, an engineer who spent 16 months
in prison for a restaurant robbery before his case was profiled on
CBS' ``60 Minutes'' and established the guilt of another man.
Geter's conviction was overturned and prosecutors backed away from
retrying him in 1985.
   Kerry FitzGerald, Ms. Brown's attorney, said he thinks
prosecutors have been more willing recently to take a second look
at cases and backtrack if they must. Nonetheless, he said citizens
are becoming concerned.
   ``People are getting scared of this,'' he said. ``They're
hearing that people are falsely accused ... and the person on the
street I'm running into is saying `that could be me, what's going
on?'''
   Geter's attorney agreed that the DA's office appears to have
softened.
   ``Last year, they fought tooth and nail to keep all of these
people in jail. I think they're handling the cases in a much more
mature manner than they did last year,'' Bradley K. Lollar said.
   Dallas County Criminal Court Judge Larry Baraka, a former
assistant district attorney, is also less critical now of the DA's
office. Last year, he called for ``radical reform.''
   ``Let's face it,'' he said. ``We're dealing with human beings in
a system that has its imperfections because it is manmade. Dallas
County isn't the only place where innocent people are convicted.''

<HEAD>State Takes Aim At Pesky Sea Lions With Rubber Arrows</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Battle of Ballard Locks escalated Thursday as
a marine biologist fired rubber-tipped arrows at sea lions that
threaten to devour a run of sea-going trout to extinction.
   Each winter, state wildlife officials try to scare away as many
as 40 of the federally protected marine mammals, which have made
the locks their home during the wild steelhead run.
   The trout provide easy dining as they wait to pass through a
fish ladder near the locks northwest of downtown Seattle on their
way to fresh-water spawning streams.
   Sea lions have been gathering at the locks for the past eight
years, but they've proved an increasing threat to the wild
steelhead run in the past five, eating 65 percent of last year's
run.
   Wildlife officials say Lake Washington's wild steelhead run is
in danger of vanishing because of the voracious mammals. The wild
steelhead is a state-protected fish.
   On Thursday, state marine biologist Steve Jeffries shot
fiberglass arrows with hard rubber tips at the animals. Meanwhile,
underwater speakers blared a tape of sounds made by beluga whales
and Weddell seals, creatures whose sounds aren't normally heard by
sea lions.
   The goal is to get the sea lions to associate the unfamiliar
sounds with an unpleasant bop on the blubber, Jeffries said.
   If the conditioning works, the sea lions should hurry away
whenever the tapes are played, although some reminder whacks may be
needed.
   The first four arrows brought startled reactions, sending the
victims rushing for deeper water.
   The arrows travel at about 200 feet per second from a crossbow
and cause some pain, said state Wildlife Department spokesman Bob
Byrne. A line is attached to each arrow so it can be recovered.
   The sea lions will be harassed with the tapes and arrows each
morning through March, when most of the wild steelhead will have
passed through the fish ladder.
   The tapes will be turned on whenever the beasts move within 150
feet of the fish-ladder entrance and they'll be shot with the
arrows when they get within 50 feet, Byrne said.
   No one know how many thumpings may be needed to condition the
sea lions or if the plan will work at all. Jeffries said similar
methods have been used on bears to keep them away from campgrounds.
   Wildlife officials also plan to send 10 of the sea lions, all
males, to the species' breeding grounds on the Channel Islands off
Southern California.
   Sea lions are making news in California, too, with hundreds of
them occupying at least 20 slips at the Pier 39 yacht basin in San
Francisco. They're delighting the tourists, but making life
miserable for the marina and boat owners.
   In the past, federal and Washington state wildlife officials
have tried trapping the beasts, screening the fish ladder with
nets, and harassing the sea lions with firecrackers and audio tapes
of natural enemies. All those efforts failed.
   About three dozen of the sea lions were captured last winter and
trucked to the southwest Washington coast, but most swam back
within several days.
   Washington state has asked the federal government for a ruling
on whether it would be legal to kill a protected marine mammal such
as the sea lion if it is harming another protected species.
   Federal officials have said a ruling could be made later this
year.

<HEAD>Japanese Election Law Strictly Followed During Campaign</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Friday AMs report.</NOTE>

   The TV news cameras pan the scene: the crowd is
there, the bunting is there, everything that goes into a
traditional campaign rally is clearly visible, except the candidate.
   All that can be seen of him is a white-gloved hand clutching a
microphone.
   This seemingly bizarre campaign coverage is part of the Japanese
media's formula for fairness in accordance with the Public
Officials Election Law.
   With 953 candidates vying for seats in the lower house of
Parliament in an election Sunday, ``we can't show everybody in the
news,'' said Takehiko Motohashi, spokesman for the prestigious
public television network NHK.
   The election law admonishes journalists not to contribute
unfairly to the election or defeat of any candidate, and it
provides for prosecution of anyone who publishes a false story
about a candidate.
   For general coverage of rallies and other staged events, NHK
sometimes does not show the candidate's face, adhering to an
all-or-none policy in covering candidates in any constituency.
Similarly, newspapers often make vague references to ``a
conservative incumbent'' and print photos showing the backs of
would-be parliamentarians.
   The Japan Newspaper Publishers and Editors Association insists
there are no legal restrictions on campaign reporting, but several
reporters spoke of a tacit understanding.
   Masato Kawahira, chief of the domestic news section of The Japan
Times, a leading English-language daily, said: ``When the official
campaign begins, we do not generally identify any of the candidates
except the party leaders or former prime ministers.''
   When the paper does name a candidate, it makes a point of naming
all the others in the constituency, ``in line with the election
law,'' he said.
   A newspaper journalist, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said that if only major candidates in a certain district were
identified, fringe candidates would complain. So, although courts
have ruled that news organs have the right to exclude fringe
candidates from their coverage, he said it is sometimes preferable
to use no names at all.
   Last week, former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, who is
seeking re-election, filed a complaint with prosecutors against
Tadao Uchida, host of a morning talk show on TV Asahi. Nakasone,
citing the election law, charged that Uchida made false statements
about his campaign.
   TV Asahi declined to comment, but following Nakasone's
complaint, Takeshi Maezawa, ombudsman for the Yomiuri Shimbun,
Japan's largest daily, said that unless a candidate has been
arrested, the news media ``must be very sensitive'' in publishing
stories about the politician.
   Party leaders figure prominently in both TV and newspaper
campaign coverage, and Cabinet members and other government
officials continue to appear in the news. This gives an advantage
to major incumbents, who can generate news at will.
   Unlike the United States, where advertising holds center stage
and is the biggest cost in political campaigns, Japan strictly
limits candidates' access to the mass media. Only political
commercials sponsored by an entire party are permitted on TV and
radio. Political newspaper ads are restricted to space the size of
a playing card.
   But even the humblest candidate gets to make at least one TV
appearance. By law, 5{ minutes are allotted free to each candidate
on the airwaves of the public broadcasting system during the
official two-week campaign period.
   Every speech is delivered from the same blue podium in front of
the same gray backdrop. Many of the office-seekers, unfamiliar with
the medium, deliver their talks in a monotone. One candidate from a
fringe party lapsed into silent prayer, presumably for votes.
   If candidates are not satisfied with their access to the media,
Yomiuri's Maezawa notes, ``the law permits them to shout their
names in the street as much as they like.''

<TEXT>
   After more than 30 years of
marriage, Winnie Mandela is finally learning to live with her
husband.
   ``I've been giving orders, and now I have to take them,'' Mrs.
Mandela said with a laugh during an interview Thursday in the
couple's home in Soweto.
   Mrs. Mandela, a trained social worker, married Nelson Mandela in
1958 when she was 24 and he was a 40-year-old African National
Congress leader on trial for treason.
   He was acquitted in 1960, went underground a year later, was
arrested in 1962 and remained in prison until Sunday. During his
more than 27 years in jail, Mrs. Mandela raised their two daughters
alone and became a forceful and controversial anti-apartheid
activist in her own right.
   Now, at 55, she said she is becoming a wife.
   ``We never really lived together,'' said Mrs. Mandela. ``So it's
like I've just got married. And I'm learning the tricks of married
life.''
   ``It is fun, and very strange indeed at my age to wake up in the
morning and I am told, `Fetch my shirt, what shirt have you
prepared? Where are my shoes? Where's my tie? What should I
wear?''' she said, reflecting traditional African society where the
male in the family is the central figure.
   It has been a marriage fraught with pain and frustration.
   While Mandela was doing hard labor on Robben Island Prison, his
wife was allowed to visit once every six months, and he could only
receive one letter every six months. After several years the
International Red Cross succeeded in having privileges increased
for Mandela and his colleagues.
   Prison authorities refused to allow the Mandelas contact visits
until a few years ago. Regulations also forbade their daughters,
Zindzi and Zenani, from seeing their father until they reached the
age of 16.
   ``All they did was just read about their father,'' Mrs. Mandela
said. ``I had to take them and introduce them to him when they
turned 16.''
   ``The trauma of that type of meeting was so hurtful. It was such
a piercing reminder of who we are, of who we are in the struggle
for the liberation of our people,'' she said. ``You just felt a
piercing dagger being struck right through your heart.''
   Since his release, Mandela has often said his wife and family
suffered more than him.
   But Mrs. Mandela said the sacrifices were worthwhile in that
they could help their children and grandchildren escape ``the kind
of racial hatred in the racial inferno of the South African
apartheid system.''
   Mrs. Mandela was under police restrictions almost continuously
from 1963 to 1986, was arrested numerous times and held in solitary
confinement for 17 months in 1969-70.
   In recent years, many activists called her ``Mother of the
Nation.''
   But her questionable political judgment, sometimes imperious
style and reluctance to consult with anti-apartheid groups led her
into repeated conflict with both the white authorities and the
black community.
   Long-simmering disputes boiled over last year when Mrs.
Mandela's bodyguards, known as the Mandela United soccer club, were
accused of abducting four youths and beating one to death.
   Nine people associated with the club are in custody for the
death, and the trial is to start shortly. Activists last year
denounced Mrs. Mandela and accused her bodyguards of waging a reign
of terror.
   She remained out of public view for several months, but then
began appearing again at anti-apartheid rallies and has now
returned to center stage with her husband's release.

   John Sterba didn't care much that his wife got
the penthouse apartment and the Rolls Royce. But when the divorce
judge gave her the dog, he howled.
   Custody of the tiny 4-year-old poodle, awarded to Mary Ellen
Meehan, was the only bone of contention in the Sterba-Meehan
divorce, said Judge Leonard Cohen.
   Sterba calls the pooch ``Red'' and Meehan calls her ``Whoofer.''
They disagreed over whether she is a ``toy'' or a ``miniature''
poodle, and over whether she was purchased by Meehan as a gift for
Sterba.
   ``John was rough with Whoofer, as he was with me,'' Meehan said
in court papers. ``Whoofer still cringes when tall men approach
her.''
   Sterba, a lawyer, and Meehan, who sells posters, were married in
1984. When they separated in 1987, Sterba moved out, and made no
effort to see the dog until more than a year later, Cohen noted in
his decision last week.
   As compensation, Cohen ordered Meehan to buy Sterba ``a
comparable breed of dog,'' and a dog bed, collar and brush.

   Former President Reagan gives videotaped
testimony today for the Iran-Contra trial of John Poindexter, whose
lawyers are trying to destroy the former president's claim that he
knew little about the activities of overzealous aides.
   Reagan's testimony at the federal courthouse in Los Angeles
could be the toughest questioning he has faced about the scandal
that caused heavy political damage to the final two years of his
presidency.
   With the press and public barred from attending, Reagan was
being asked 154 questions plus follow-ups that focus on his
meetings with Poindexter, his former national security adviser.
Then Reagan faced cross-examination by Iran-Contra prosecutors, in
questioning that could carry over until Saturday.
   Poindexter goes on trial March 5 on charges of concealing from
Congress Oliver North's assistance to the Contras and lying about a
1985 shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran.
   Three years ago, Reagan portrayed himself as a president who was
kept in the dark. But Poindexter contends he kept his boss fully
informed about all aspects of the affair _ with the apparent
exception of the diversion of Iran arms sale money to the Contras _
and that Reagan authorized his activities.
   Reagan said early in 1987 that he hadn't known about ``secret
bank accounts and diverted funds,'' two products of the Iran-Contra
affair which he found ``personally distasteful.'' He told the Tower
Commission he didn't know the National Security Council staff was
assisting the Nicaraguan Contras.
   Poindexter subsequently told Congress, however, he believed
Reagan understood that ``Col. North was instrumental in keeping the
Contras supported without maybe understanding the details of
exactly what he was doing.''
   Details emerged at North's trial last year of Reagan's telephone
call to the president of Honduras to get the release of a seized
shipment of ammunition destined for the Contras.
   Also at North's trial, an NSC staffer testified that CIA
director William Casey said Reagan had designated North as the
``principal point of reference'' for sustaining the Contras during
a congressional ban on military aid to the rebel force.
   In 1987, Poindexter said it was understandable that Reagan
didn't recall a briefing in which the national security adviser
provided details about the Contra support program.
   But today's questions by Poindexter's lawyers sought to press
the former president about his almost-daily meetings with his
national security adviser.
   On the agenda, according to court papers:
   _The president's knowledge of North's relationship with various
individuals in the Contra operation and the Iran initiative.
   _Whether Poindexter told Reagan of the status of Richard Secord,
who North enlisted to move supplies to the Nicaraguan rebels and
who operated the network of offshore accounts known as the
Enterprise to move money in the Iran-Contra affair.
   _Reagan's discussions with Poindexter regarding a chronology on
a November 1985 Hawk shipment that forms the basis of four of the
five criminal charges against Poindexter.
   _Whether Reagan advised Poindexter to tell congressional
committees they already had been given information about whether
North was secretly assisting the Contras. The earlier responses
were denials that North was raising money and providing military
advice to the Contras. They led to former national security adviser
Robert McFarlane's guilty plea to criminal charges of withholding
information from Congress.
   Reagan, in a March 1987 an address to the nation, said, ``As
angry as I may be about activities undertaken without my knowledge,
I am still accountable for those activities.''
   But Secord, who received two years' probation for his role in
the Iran-Contra affair, complained Reagan has been ``hiding out ...
I think it's cowardly.
   ``I think he should have stood up and taken the heat just as
previous presidents have done,'' said Secord, who pleaded guilty to
making a false statement in connection with proceeds from the
Enterprise used to benefit North.
   On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Harold Greene rejected a
request by news organizations to attend today's deposition.
However, Greene said he would order the videotape released within a
few days, after editing to remove material deemed to touch on
classified matters.

Strength</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   When Richard Nixon broke the ice with
Communist China in 1972, reversing a frosty U.S. policy of
isolation, it was said by the sages in Washington that only a
strong president could take such a step.
   That wisdom might be applied to Mikhail Gorbachev in his
startling reversal of policy on U.S. and Soviet troop levels in
Europe and on unification of East and West Germany.
   That is the view, at least, of some State Department officials
who had a front-row seat as Gorbachev reversed Soviet policy on
both fronts this week. The key to their analysis is what transpired
at the meeting of the Central Committee of the Communist Party
before the policy shifts.
   There Gorbachev led the party into abrogating the constitutional
provision that gives the party a monopoly on political power. This
sets the stage for contested elections and a thorough overhaul of
the Soviet system.
   From the historic meeting Gorbachev went into talks with
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, refusing in a brief exchange
with reporters to commit himself to running for re-election to the
presidency as a communist.
   ``Let's wait and see,'' Gorbachev said before the session that
led by Tuesday to Soviet approval of the U.S. framework for German
unification and to Soviet acceptance of a U.S. manpower advantage
in Europe.
   The U.S. plan gives East Germany and West Germany wide latitude
in shaping the united country that will begin to emerge soon after
March 18 national elections in East Germany. The United States,
Britain, France and the Soviet Union would have only a supervisory
role and only on ``external'' issues.
   The Soviets' capacity to restrain any resurgence of German
nationalism will be doubly submerged.
   First, the U.S. plan would leave most sovereign decisions to the
Germans. Second, the Soviets' supervisory role would be filtered
through joint decisions by the four countries.
   Gorbachev tipped his hand a little about changing his mind in
late January when he acknowledged the gathering force of German
determination to end 45 years of division, saying, ``time itself is
having an impact on the process and lending dynamism to it.''
   Incredibly, by Tuesday the Soviets had agreed to a framework
that could put the territory of East Germany into NATO as part of a
merged, single state, although West German Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher is dangling the possibility that Western
troops would not be deployed in the area.
   Even if NATO and the merged Germany took that step, the shift in
Soviet policy still would amount to an enormous reversal by the
Kremlin.
   Gorbachev's switch on U.S. and Soviet troop ceilings came at the
``Open Skies'' conference in Ottawa only a few days after he
countered President Bush's imbalanced Jan. 31 proposal with options
of equal ceilings of U.S. and Soviet troops on foreign soil in
Europe.
   As the Bush administration hesitated, Gorbachev gave in and
agreed to 195,000 soldiers on both sides in Central Europe and an
additional 30,000 Americans outside the zone.
   It might have been a canny move by the Soviet leader.
   He is locking in a withdrawal of 80,000 U.S. soldiers from
Europe to get down to the new ceilings with leverage he might not
have a year from now. By then, far fewer Soviet troops than the
current force of about 600,000 are apt to be in Europe as
Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland all press for Soviet withdrawal.
   Strategy apart, though, the State Department view is that
Gorbachev is acting out of strength, not out of weakness.
   Referring to his victories at the Central Committee meeting, one
official commented: ``What one sees in Gorbachev now is someone who
... clearly controls all the major levers of power. There is no
question when you look at the outcome of this plenum that he is
politically strengthened.''
   As the official, who demanded anonymity, sizes up Gorbachev's
situation, the Soviet leader's successes in reaching agreements
with the United States will strengthen his hand at the coming Party
Congress.
   There Gorbachev will move to institute political reform and
build up the presidency. He has ``a stake in continuing to be
successful on the outside and to show that he is a master and can
manage the U.S. relationship very well,'' the official said.
   The irony is that while Gorbachev accrues even more political
power, he will not be able to blame opponents in the Central
Committee or the Politburo if he cannot solve the Soviet Union's
economic problems.

<HEAD>Cable TV Group Promises Better Service _ But it May Cost More</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cable television customers may soon find
they're getting better service _ faster installation, service calls
and refunds _ but the industry says it could cost them higher rates.
   The National Cable Television Association, in announcing the new
public relations campaign Thursday, said cable companies may have
to add personnel and costly new equipment and facilities.
   ``If customers want high-quality programming and ... state of
the art plants _ sure it's going to cost them something,'' said
James Mooney, NCTA president. ``But I think it will not be a
significant upward boost in rates.''
   The voluntary customer service guidelines were adopted by the
NCTA board of directors on Wednesday in Boca Raton, Fla.
   John Goddard, president of Viacom Cable and chairman of the
association's customer relations committee, said it would cost his
company about $1 million, not including additional personnel.
Viacom had about 1.1 million subscribers at the beginning of 1989.
   An official at the nation's largest cable company,
Tele-Communications Inc., said in a telephone interview from Denver
that the company will implement the guidelines and expects to
absorb any implementing costs.
   ``There are some costs associated with it but we expect them to
be offset by an increased customer base,'' said Anne Draper, TCI's
director of community affairs.
   The guidelines do not address the issue of monthly rates, which
have risen sharply in some cases since cable TV essentially was
deregulated in 1987.
   Mooney said prices stabilized last year at about the rate of
inflation or below. Nonetheless, nearly a score of cable
re-regulation bills have been introduced in Congress by members who
have been besieged by constituents complaining of poor cable
service and high rates.
   ``In all candor, we can say that a significant number of our
companies haven't gotten to the point where customer service is
adequate,'' Mooney said.
   He rejected assertions that cable companies should be able to
provide a high level of customer service without adopting programs
that could drive rates higher.
   ``These problems are characteristic of any industry that has
developed as rapidly as this one has,'' Mooney said.
   Cable officials hope the standards can be adopted nationwide by
July 1991. The standards say:
   _More customer service representatives will be hired so
telephone calls can be answered within 30 seconds, including
waiting time and transfers, and automated answering systems will
limit the number of rings to four. This standard should be achieved
90 percent of the time.
   _Under normal circumstances, a customer will receive a busy
signal less than 3 percent of the time a cable company office is
open.
   _Standard installations will be performed within seven business
days.
   _The cable operator will respond to service interruptions
promptly, certainly within 24 hours, in situations not beyond the
cable company's control. Other service problems will be responded
to within 36 hours during the normal work week.
   _Morning, afternoon and all-day appointment estimates should be
established.
   _If an installer or technician is running late, an attempt will
be made to contact the customer to set up a new appointment.
   _Customers should be given 30 days' notice of rate increases.
   _Bills should state clearly what services a customer is
receiving and how much they cost.
   NCTA will not try to enforce the guidelines out of antitrust
concerns, but Mooney said they likely would be written into
franchising agreements between cable companies and local
governments.
   Rep. Matthew J. Rinaldo, R-N.J., ranking minority member of the
House Energy and Commerce telecommunications and finance
subcommittee, applauded the guidelines, saying cable executives
``at last recognize that either they serve the public better or
they face the prospect of dealing with all the costs, headaches and
delays of a federal bureaucracy telling them what to do.''

   Searchers have located the wreck of a
twin-engine New England Airlines plane that disappeared off Block
Island in November with eight people aboard, the commuter carrier's
president said Thursday night.
   Underwater cameras provided positive identification of the
10-seat aircraft about three miles west of Block Island, said
airline President William Bendokas.
   The cameras indicated several bodies were inside, Bendokas said.
   The plane vanished Nov. 28 during a 17-mile flight from Block
Island to the mainland. A weeklong search by the Coast Guard
uncovered only the bodies of two dogs that had been on board and
debris from the plane.
   A wing and an engine have also been recovered, Bendokas said. No
bodies were found and the seven passengers and the pilot who were
aboard were presumed dead.
   Bendokas said recovery of the bodies and the plane wreckage,
which is under about 150 feet of water and is spread over an area
of several hundred feet, would take several days. The site is near
the plane's intended flight path, he said.
   A fisherman in the area pulled up some debris from the plane in
a fishing net about a week ago, and contacted New England Airlines,
Bendokas said. He said subsequent investigations by divers during
the past few days positively identified the aircraft.
   Asked whether the wreckage will provide clues to the cause of
the crash, Bendokas, himself a licensed pilot, said, ``No one
knows. Everyone hopes so.''
   Aboard the plane were pilot John Beck Jr. and passengers Judy
Johnson of Essex Falls, N.J.; Shirley Wood of Block Island; David
Sulle of Block Island; Duane Lane and his son, Darrell, of
Richmond, R.I.; Craig Tobias of North Attleboro; and John Barrows
of Dorset, Va.

   Paul McCartney, on his first world tour
since 1976, says he plans to keep performing live, though probably
not with other surviving Beatles.
   ``I have no thoughts of ending touring at all,'' he said
Thursday before the second of two shows with his band in
Indianapolis.
   ``With the Stones, with The Who and with us, with our age group,
maybe the first thought is, well, this is probably the last time
they'll be out,'' said McCartney, 47. ``Certainly not the way we're
going. We're having fun.''
   But McCartney also said there's little chance he'll ever perform
again with former Beatles George Harrison and Ringo Starr.
   ``We'd have to get to know each other before that. It's been a
long time. I think the actual reunion question is a no-no,'' he
said at a news conference.
   In recent interviews, McCartney has said he, Harrison and Starr
might get together for ``little projects'' including a film and
possibly would play music, though they wouldn't call it a Beatles
reunion.
   The group split 20 years ago, and John Lennon, with whom
McCartney composed most of the Beatles' songs, was shot to death in
December 1980.
   McCartney, in the second U.S. leg of his world tour, is
performing live for only the second time since the Beatles last
toured in 1966. McCartney's post-Beatles band Wings toured 13 years
ago.

   Joe Clark, who gained fame for wielding a
baseball bat and bullhorn as the principal of a Paterson, N.J.,
high school, says racial integration of schools has failed.
   ``This integration stuff is a bunch of bovine balderdash,''
Clark, who is black, said during a news conference Thursday. He
ridiculed what he called the notion that the ``brains of the white
kids are going to jump into the black kids.''
   Clark said the black family structure must become stronger if
blacks are to hold their own. Many young black males are
``dangerous, ruthless, volatile, and they will kill you. And it's
not their fault.''
   Black fathers must hold up their end and support black women,
who traditionally have provided the backbone for their families, he
said.
   ``Black people must grasp control of their own destiny,'' he
said. ``I do know that this welfare stuff has to go.'' He said the
welfare system sends the message: ``Have as many babies as you want
to; we'll take care of you. Why do you need a man?''
   Clark, 49, maintained that the things he says are also things
whites want to say but are afraid to. Even blacks want to say them,
he said, but are afraid of being called ``Uncle Toms.''
   Clark was portrayed as a tough disciplinarian in the 1989 Warner
Bros. movie ``Lean On Me.'' He was Eastside High School's principal
from 1982 until last year.
   He had heart surgery last May and now travels the lecture
circuit.

   The man that actor Don Johnson
caught allegedly rummaging through his hotel room pleaded innocent
by reason of insanity to a felony burglary count and trial was set
for next month.
   Henry Kenneth Rosenbaum, 35, entered the plea Thursday in
Municipal Court and a March 22 trial date was set, said defense
attorney William Graysen. Rosenbaum remained free on $50,000 bail.
   The complaint charges that the ``Miami Vice'' television star
and his actress-wife, Melanie Griffith, returned to their Bel-Air
Hotel room on Jan. 29, 1989, and found Rosenbaum going through Miss
Griffith's purse.
   Johnson testified at a preliminary hearing that he confronted
Rosenbaum in the suite's bedroom, ordering him to lie down on the
floor and put his hands behind his head until police arrived.
   Neither Johnson nor Miss Griffith were hurt.

   Comedian Sam Kinison's ex-wife is still
waiting for the minister-turned-screaming comic to make a $50,000
alimony payment, celebrity attorney Marvin Mitchelson said.
   Mitchelson, who represents Terry Kinison, said Wednesday the
comedian was scheduled to pay his ex-wife $50,000, covering his
alimony obligation for 1990, by Jan. 5.
   ``He's been stalling her,'' Mitchelson said.
   Mitchelson said he planned to ask a Superior Court judge at a
hearing March 9 to require Kinison to pay $10,000 in fines.
Mitchelson filed a contempt-of-court claim against Kinison last
week.
   The couple was divorced in May and reached a property settlement
in September, he said.
   Kinison, a former Pentecostal preacher, is known for his loud,
profanity-laced comedy routines. His publicity agency said his
publicist was out of the office and could not be reached for
comment Wednesday.

   The election of Marion S. Barry Jr. as mayor
of the nation's capital was celebrated throughout black America.
The son of a Mississippi sharecropper, a scarred veteran of the
civil rights movement, he had soared to what he long preached as
its ultimate goal _ political power.
   Now, 12 years later, many see him not as the portrayer of
promise, but of betrayal.
   Though the energized hope which Barry bore into the mayor's
office had long since lost its gleam, it virtually went up in smoke
with a few videotaped puffs on a cocaine pipe in an FBI ``sting''
operation a month ago.
   The charge then was a single misdemeanor count. But many
contended the arrest showed that Barry, 53, had reneged upon his
obligation to wage war on the drug dealers who have brought so much
violence and pain to the capital and its children.
   On Thursday, a federal grand jury unfurled a longer list of
charges: Three felony counts, for allegedly lying about his drug
use, and five more misdemeanor counts for alleged possession.
   For years there had been questions about whether Barry, a former
lieutenant to Martin Luther King Jr., had been corrupted by the
power he sought since his days of chopping cotton and waiting
tables. But Barry pronounced himself ``invincible'' to his critics,
whether in or out of law enforcement.
   ``What I have done,'' he told a Los Angeles Times reporter in a
memorable barroom interview just two months ago, ``nobody knows
about, because I don't get caught.''
   And for more than a decade it seemed he was invincible. He was
twice re-elected, using as his base a city payroll which included
one out of every 12 residents. He courted his predominantly black
constituency by steering housing projects, jobs programs and
government contracts their way.
   That support did not falter, even as basic municipal services
remained in disarray despite the huge payroll _ three times the
size, on a per capita basis, of the city government of Los Angeles.
To this day residents can spend hours waiting for a simple license
renewal and days to have their streets cleared of snow.
   Nor was the mayor troubled by matters that would do in other
politicians. He frequented topless bars and cruised around town in
his blue limousine, paying nocturnal visits to a variety of people
who ordinarily wouldn't be expected to have a mayor drop by _ known
drug dealers, low-grade city workers, young women. He made mystery
trips to tropical spots, sometimes in the company of a woman not
his wife, including one, Rasheeda Moore, who eventually turned
against him by working for the FBI.
   A previous wife, Mary Treadwell, and several close associates,
including two deputy mayors, went to prison over various charges of
misconduct. One aide bought the mayor's second wife, Effi, a mink
coat with city funds, repaid by Barry after the episode was
publicized.
   Through all of that, Barry would simply refuse to answer the
more troublesome questions about his behavior. Instead, he
suggested they came from a racist media and a Republican
administration eager to return control of the city to a white
Congress. Many Washingtonians believed him, and when Barry
scheduled an announcement last month that he would run for a fourth
term, few were prepared to bet against him.
   That changed in a heartbeat, when Ms. Moore, a former
high-fashion model in trouble with the law, called him and invited
him to her room in the Vista International Hotel. Next door were
the FBI agents who watched his every move and videotaped them.
   Four days later, on the day he was to declare his renewed
candidacy, Barry instead entered St. Timothy's Episcopal Church
near his home. And, in a confession to his public and an apology to
his wife, he acknowledged he had succumbed to ``weaknesses.''
   ``How I wish I could trade this hour,'' he declared in tears.
``This time, I've come face to face with my deepest human
failures.''
   With that, Barry was off to a drug treatment center in Florida.
When he will return remains uncertain. Meanwhile, the grand jury
returned on Thursday.

<HEAD>Study: Cosmic Rays Pose Danger to Airliner Crews</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although most U.S. airliner flights will be
free of tobacco smoke after next week, crewmembers and frequent
fliers still face a health danger from cosmic radiation, a new
government study says.
   The Transportation Department study of airliner cabin
environment released Thursday indicates radiation from the sun and
stars poses a cancer risk comparable to that faced by nonsmokers in
a plane where smoking is allowed.
   The study sent to Congress earlier this week recommends that
airlines schedule cabin crews in ways that will reduce their risk
to cosmic rays, especially those crews who regularly fly near the
North Pole and South Pole or at higher altitudes.
   It also recommends a total smoking ban, but that was superceded
by congressional action that imposed a ban on all flights of six
hours or less beginning Feb. 25.
   The study reflects uncertainty over the effects of low doses of
radiation but attempts to measure the possible risk to airliner
crews, business travelers and passengers who fly only infrequently.
   The study included scientific monitoring of 69 smoking and 23
non-smoking flights between April and June 1989. It found some risk
to non-smoking crew and passengers on flights where smoking is
allowed.
   It estimated that about four non-smoking crew members would have
died of premature lung cancer as a result of cabin exposure over
the next 20 years, assuming each crew member flies about 960 hours
a year.
   One death every two to four years would have occurred among
non-smoking passengers exposed for 30 years, the study estimated.
   Researchers did not monitor cosmic radiation levels but made
health risk estimates based on previously gathered data. It
analyzed several flight paths using information gathered in a
United Nations study of atomic radiation.
   It estimates that the lifetime cancer risk due to cosmic
radiation for airline crew members who fly 960 hours a year would
be from five to 61 deaths for every 100,000 individuals in 20 years
of flying. It also notes some risk to frequent fliers and to the
fetuses of pregnant women during the first trimester of pregnancy.
   The study found no health risk from bacteria or fungi in airline
cabins.

   Fertilizer costs are rising but probably won't
be as high as they were a year ago when farmers take to the fields
this spring, according to an Agriculture Department report.
   A preliminary report released Thursday by the department's
Economic Research Service said fertilizer prices may be up 4
percent from last fall. But despite the increase, spring prices may
be down about 4 percent from year-earlier levels.
   ``Planted areas of corn and wheat, the major fertilizer-using
crops, will probably increase by 1 percent to 5 percent,'' the
report said. ``Decreases in planted acreage are anticipated for
soybeans.''
   Analysts said supplies of nitrogen, phosphate and potash should
be enough to meet 1990 requirements, although greater nitrogen
imports will more than make up for lower domestic production.
   ``Nitrogen prices will likely show the greatest increase since
last fall as domestic supplies tighten,'' the report said.
``Phosphate supplies should be sufficient to meet demand at
moderately higher prices than last fall, even with a slight
reduction in domestic production.''
   Potash inventories are expected to be available at ``stable to
slightly lower'' prices than last fall if price cuts initiated by
Canadian producers continue, the report said.
   On a global basis, the use of plant nutrients rose about 3
percent last year, and growth in fertilizer production, use and
trade will probably continue in the 1990s, the report said.
   Energy prices at the farm will probably ``remain at or perhaps
slightly above 1989 levels due to the anticipated steady price of
imported crude oil,'' the report said. However, total expenditures
by farmers may rise 4.6 percent this year to $9.09 billion because
of increases in crop plantings and a ``modest rise'' in irrigation.
   Farm machinery sales rose an estimated $570 million in 1989 to
$6.6 billion, the report said. Lower farm debt and higher farmland
values helped strengthen sales last year.
   Sales of four-wheel-drive tractors were up 52 percent in 1989
and are forecast to rise another 45 percent this year.

   A new program has been designed by the
Agriculture Department to help curb the spread of a food-poisoning
organism, Salmonella enteritidis, in poultry flocks that produce
table eggs for consumers.
   The organism, which has a number of strains, has been identified
with food poisoning in humans who have consumed contaminated eggs
that were improperly cooked.
   Assistant Secretary Jo Ann R. Smith said Thursday that the $6.8
million control program will focus on testing and certification of
breeding flocks that produce the table-egg layers, and on tracing
back and testing commercial egg flocks if and when they are
implicated in human cases of S. enteritidis.
   The interstate movement of chickens, eggs and associated
articles from flocks infected or associated with the bacteria will
be restricted, she said.
   Smith said S. enteritidis is a growing problem in the nation's
$3.2 billion egg industry ``and has emerged as a serious public
health concern as well.'' She said strains of the organism are
entrenched in Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states and are
expanding into the Midwest and Northwest.
   In humans, the bacteria can cause cramps, diarrhea, fever, and
sometimes nausea and vomiting five to 72 hours after eating
contaminated food. Smith said some people, such as the elderly or
those with poor immune systems, can suffer serious and
life-threatening effects from eating contaminated eggs or other
food.
   An interim rule will put the program into effect as of Feb. 16,
Smith said. Public comments on the plan, docket no. 88-161, will be
accepted through April 17. Those can be sent to: Chief, Regulatory
Analysis and Development, PPD, APHIS, USDA, Room 866, Federal
Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, Md. 20782.

   The Agriculture Department says price supports
for peanuts grown under 1990 quotas will be $631.47 per ton, an
increase of $15.60 from last year.
   Officials said Thursday that the increase was mandated by law,
which requires annual adjustments in the national support level for
quota-type peanuts based on costs of production. As costs increase,
so does the peanut support level.
   Production of non-quota peanuts, which can be grown for peanut
oil and meal, and for export, will be supported at $149.75 per ton,
unchanged from last year.
   The Bush administration has asked Congress to eliminate the
escalator in the peanut support formula and put the program in line
with other farm commodity supports.

   President Bush's trip to the Colombian drug
summit produced some footnotes for the history books about a
topsy-turvy helicopter ride, an unabashed attempt at flattery and
utter rejection.
   And, not to be overlooked was this declaration from Bush: ``I'm
not fuming.''
   The trip to Cartagena to plot anti-drug strategy got off to an
unusual start when Bush decided to sleep overnight Wednesday on Air
Force One in a guarded airport hangar so he wouldn't have to wake
up for a pre-dawn departure.
   The plane lifted off with Bush in bed. Just before landing in
Colombia, the refreshed president visited the plane's media section
to express unhappiness about news stories emphasizing his penchant
for secrecy.
   Bush said he was going to stop talking to the press because
``I'm not going to be burned for holding out (information), doing
something deceptive.''
   He said, ``I think there are too many press conferences. It's
not good. It overdoes it. It's overexposure to the thing.''
   After his plane landed at Barranquilla, Bush switched to a
helicopter for the 60-mile ride to the drug summit at Cartagena. It
was a strange 45-minute journey.
   The swarm of five helicopters carrying Bush, members of his
entourage and the media moved out fast and flew low, rolling and
weaving over marshes and pastures, scaring up herds of cattle and
sending horses running.
   This kind of flight pattern is known as contour flying, a
low-level evasion tactic used to elude attack. What else would you
do in a country wracked by drug violence?
   Four of the helicopters landed. Suddenly from the opposite
direction, the fifth helicopter, this one carrying Bush, roared in
for a landing.
   Within minutes, Bush was greeting the leaders of Colombia, Peru
and Bolivia.
   ``You're a big man,'' Bush told one tall, broad-shouldered man.
``You're a big guy.''
   The target of his flattery was Peruvian President Alan Garcia, a
mercurial leader who had threatened to throw a monkey wrench into
the summit.
   First, Garcia declared he would boycott the meeting to protest
the U.S. invasion of Panama.
   Then, to the consternation of U.S. officials, Garcia said he was
bringing some coca growers with him. Coca is the plant used to make
cocaine, and Garcia wanted to make the point that coca growers need
economic help to switch to legal crops.
   Against that background, it was uncertain how the two presidents
would get along.
   When they finally came face to face, Bush turned on the charm.
   ``Glad to meet you at last,'' Bush told Garcia and followed up
by commenting on Garcia's stature.
   When Garcia replied, Bush apologized that, ``My Spanish isn't so
good.'' But it was all smiles between the two leaders.
   What about the coca growers?
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III told reporters he didn't
see them. But he tossed the question to Peruvian Prime Minister
Guillermo Larco Cox, sitting next to him at a conference table.
   ``They were not allowed to come to the meeting,'' the prime
minister said.
   American officials said the growers had been exiled to a
Cartagena hotel, away from the summit site _ total rejection.
   Separately, Bush was asked by reporters if he had seen any coca
growers.
   He refused to answer. Instead, Bush wanted to talk about press
stories written about his remarks earlier in the day warning that
he was going to clam up on the media.
   It was all a misunderstanding, Bush said. ``If you tell (the
media) I'm not fuming, I'll answer'' about whether he had seen any
coca growers.
   He got a quick agreement and offered a brief answer.
   ``Haven't seen any,'' Bush said. With that, he left for more
drug talks.

political career of District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry:
   1974: Barry, a black activist, is elected to the D.C. City
Council.
   1976: Barry is re-elected to the council.
   March 9, 1977: Hanafi Muslims shoot Barry in the chest during
their seizure of the District Building. The bullet barely misses
Barry's heart, but he's back at work a week later.

Washington and City Council President Sterling Tucker.
   Nov. 7, 1978: Barry is elected mayor.
   Jan. 2, 1979: Barry is inaugurated; pledges that ``here in
Washington D.C., we will be our brother's keeper.'' During his
first term, the city deficit mushrooms, forcing Barry to cut jobs
and services and press for more federal aid. He weathers a major
snowstorm and a drawn-out teacher's strike.
   1982: Barry is re-elected. His second term sees improved fiscal
health, renewal of the downtown area, a decline in unemployment and
crime and growing crowding of the city's jails and prisons.
Scandals begin to take their toll as 10 top city officials are
convicted of various financial crimes.
   Sept. 25, 1983: Barry is stricken with chest pains while
attending a meeting in a downtown hotel; hospital officials blamed
the episode on a hiatal hernia. A physician not involved in his
treatment tells police the mayor suffered a drug overdose, a report
not revealed for six years. Police then say they could find no
evidence for the physician's statement.
   Nov. 4, 1986: Despite his mounting troubles, Barry is re-elected
to an unprecedented third term, taking 61 percent of the vote.
   Jan. 2, 1987: Barry is inaugurated.

that he used cocaine with a former city employee.
   Dec. 22, 1988: Police officers planning to attempt a drug buy
from Charles Lewis, a former Virgin Islands official and
acquaintance of Barry's, are called back when it's discovered that
the mayor is in Lewis' hotel room. Traces of cocaine are found in
the room.
   Dec. 29, 1988: U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens announces plans to

   Here is the text of the statement issued by
Washington Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Today's indictment does not surprise me at all, because it
represents a continuation of the political lynching and excesses of
the Justice Department in this multi-year, multimillion-dollar
effort to investigate me and the Barry administration.
   I am not surprised; in fact, if it has to happen, I'm glad it's
now rather than later, and I am relieved that the indictment has
finally been issued and the suspense has ended. All of the
calculated, carefully orchestrated rumors and leaks by the federal
government have put a damper on the city and its people. But now
that we will be moving into the courtroom _ which is where this
case should be tried, not in the press _ I am relieved. I know that
when a trial is held, I will be exonerated.
   Until that time, I urge the public to hold fast to our
democratic principle that presumes a person to be innocent until
proven guilty in a court of law. I further ask that members of the
media exercise restraint and professionalism in not seeking to
interview me or my family about this matter that now clearly will
be in the hands of the court. I will have nothing to say about this
case outside the courtroom.
   As I continue to undergo the healing of my mind, body and soul,
I want to assure the residents of Washington D.C. that I am not
considering resignation. An indictment is not a finding of guilty _
it is simply a formal charge based on the presentation of only one
side of the evidence. Now, I have the right to defend myself
against that charge.
   I also want to tell you that I am firmly committed to continuing
to focus on my recovery from the disease of alcoholism and its
attendant problems _ a disease that affects millions of Americans,
including such notable and courageous individuals as former first
lady Betty Ford.
   I have derived great benefit from my stay here at the alcohol
rehabilitation center in Florida, and I know that recovery is a
lifelong process to which I have dedicated myself.
   But for now, as I go through this healing process, I want to
make sure that my wife and our son are psychologically and
emotionally comfortable, after all that we have through and will be
going through, as a family. I do not want them badgered and dogged
at every turn. They do not suffer from the disease, I do. Any
consequences should be mine to bear, not theirs.
   I am extremely proud of the way my management team, headed by
City Administrator Carol Thompson, has handled the affairs of
government in my absence. I know this budget period is a tough time
for Carol; my staff director, Maudine Cooper; Deputy Mayors Bob
Pohlman and Wylie Williams; Director of Special Services, Tina
Smith; and the agency directors who must explain the serious
realities of the city's financial picture during an election year.
   I know citizens need assurance that their needs will be met, and
that the same high quality government services will continue
uninterrupted in spite of the mean-spirited and calculating people
who would like to see us fail as a local government. I put a strong
management team in place, and I can reassure you that government is
operating smoothly, efficiently and effectively _ and under the
Barry philosophy of quality, compassionate, competent and caring
service.
   I want to say to all that when I decided to go away to deal with
my health concerns, my political decisions were placed on hold and
will be determined within the next 60 days. Anita Bonds is the only
person designated and authorized by me to speak on political
matters.
   My lawyer, Kenneth Mundy, and I are now preparing to go to court
and win this case. I will have no announcement about my political
future at this point.
   I hope the media will respect my right to continue my recovery,
in private, and allow me to obtain the full benefit of treatment
for this disease. During my absence, I urge you to respect the
rights of my wife and my son to lead private lives as we go forward
during this highly political legal procedure. I ask that you
confine your questions about the legal case to my attorney. Any
other questions about me should be directed to my press secretary,
Lurma Rackley.
   To all of you who continue to remember me, my family, and this
city in your prayers, I sincerely thank you.

   The Environmental Protection Agency is adding
71 hazardous waste sites, including 14 Defense Department
installations, to its national priority cleanup list.
   The action on Thursday brings the total number of sites on the
list to 1,081.
   The 71 sites previously had been proposed for listing and had
undergone a final review before being placed on the cleanup list.
Another 137 sites have been proposed for cleanup under the federal
Superfund law, but still await final reviews, officials said.
   The action brings the total number of defense facilities on the
priority cleanup list to 75.
   One site was dropped from the list, the Keyser Avenue Borehole
in Scranton, Pa. Officials said it did not pose a big enough health
threat for listing.
   Placement on the list makes non-federal sites eligible for
federal cleanup aid.

<HEAD>Highlights of Drug Summit Communique</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARTAGENA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Following are highlights of the
13-page communique signed by the presidents of the United States,
Colombia, Peru and Bolivia to fight illicit drugs.
   The nations pledged to work together toward ``dynamic programs''
to fight the flow of drugs from the Andean nations to the United
States.
   The statement broke no new ground, but sounded a strong theme of
cooperation.
   ``The parties recognize that trafficking in illicit drugs has a
negative, long-term impact on their economies,'' it asserted.
   Specifically, the presidents agreed:
   _They would cooperate in exchanging information and
intelligence. But, in an apparent foreclosure of the use of U.S.
military forces in the region, the communique asserted ``each
country may involve its armed forces in this fight within its own
national territory.''
   Still the United States agreed ``to provide increased equipment
and training to the law enforcement agencies and the militaries of
the Andean parties.''
   _They will call for a ``world conference against illicit drug
trafficking in 1991'' and hold a high-level followup to Thursday's
four-nation session ``within six months.''
   _The United States would help train Andean farmers on how to
switch to other crops to substitute for the lucrative coca harvest.
   _Bush will request an economic aid package of an unspecified
amount from Congress for fiscal 1991 to 1994 to help offset
``significant, immediate and long-term costs'' caused by the loss
of the coca crop in the three Andean countries. The president has
earlier pledged a total of $2.2 billion in economic and military
anti-drug assistance for the Andean nations over five years.
   _The United States will try to open its markets more to South
American goods and to provide balance-of-payments assistance to
help stabilize the economies of the drug-production countries,
which have rampant inflation.
   _The Bush administration will work for more private investment
in the Andean nations.
   _The four countries will sponsor programs to strengthen public
awareness of drug problems.
   ``The parties reaffirm their will to fight drug trafficking in a
comprehensive manner attacking all facets of the trade: production,
transportation and consumption,'' the statement said.
   On the sensitive issue of military involvement, the communique
said ``the control of illegal trafficking is essentially a law
enforcement matter'' rather than a military one.
   However, it says that because of the ``magnitude'' of the
problem, ``the armed forces in each of these countries, within
their own territory and national jurisdictions, may also
participate.''
   The statement also calls for better intelligence-gathering
cooperation, stepped up enforcement, more control of chemicals used
to manufacture drugs, tighter restrictions on ``weapons, planes,
ships, explosives and communications equipment'' used in drug
trafficking.
   All the parties agreed to ``strengthen controls over the
movement of illegal weapons.''
   The Andean nations have complained that semi-automatic weapons
made in the United States are finding their way into the hands of
drug traffickers. However, Bush thus far has resisted proposals to
change U.S. laws to further restrict the manufacture and export of
such firearms.
   In addition to the multilateral communique, the United States
reached six bilateral agreements with the other countries. Those
incorporate:
   _An agreement with Bolivia in which the State Department will
``help diminish that flow of U.S. light arms and other arms to drug
traffickers in the Andean countries'' by requiring weapons
exporters to obtain an import certificate from the importing
government before the United States will issue an export license.
The administration also committed to further discussions to
determine what weapons are covered by the directive, and to
``pursuing discussion'' with other governments concerned about
limiting the flow of U.S. weapons to illegitimate end users in the
Andean countries.
   _An extradition agreement with Peru, asserting that narcotics
traffickers are extraditable under Peru's 1889 extradition treaty
with the United States.
   _An agreement with Peru to exchange tax records, bank statements
and other information to uncover drug profiteering and money
laundering. It also calls for prosecution of tax evasion to catch
drug dealers, and exchanges of technical information to improve tax
compliance.
   _An agreement with Bolivia pledging cooperation and
information-sharing to crack down on illegal U.S. exports of
chemicals used to manufacture cocaine. The countries vowed to
promptly investigate the destination of such chemicals and seize
those destined for illicit points. The agreement requires domestic
legislation if needed to provide for such seizure.
   _Public awareness agreements with Peru and Bolivia to build
public support against narcotics production, distribution and use.
They also call for establishment of a computerized data base on
anti-drug activities, and joint sponsorship of mass media projects
to promote information-sharing about drug problems and solutions.

<HEAD>Government May Borrow Up to $44 Billion More for Thrift Bailout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is moving forward with
plans to borrow as much as $44 billion more this year to finance
its savings and loan bailout, but it's leaving unresolved the
politically touchy question of how the borrowing will affect the
budget deficit.
   A Treasury Department-led board overseeing the Resolution Trust
Corp. is expected to formally approve the plan as soon as today.
   Oversight board staff members on Thursday told congressional
aides the borrowing could start at the end of this month, total as
much as $11 billion by the end of March and $44 billion by the end
of the year.
   The private briefings on Capitol Hill followed a ruling from the
Justice Department that the RTC, created to dispose of failed
thrifts, may legally borrow from the Federal Financing Bank, a
conduit for funneling Treasury money to government agencies.
   S&amp;L bailout legislation enacted in August provided $50 billion
through next year to cover the losses in failed thrift
institutions. But the RTC needs to temporarily borrow as much as
$100 billion more.
   The borrowing, called ``working capital,'' would be repaid as
the government sold loans, real estate and other assets inherited
from failed thrifts.
   However, the politically sensitive issue of what impact the
borrowing will have on the budget deficit remains up in the air.
   The Office of Management and Budget has the authority to decide
how to account for the borrowing, but it plans to consult with
Congress before making the decision, according to OMB spokeswoman
Barbara Clay.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a member of the Banking and Budget
committees, and other congressional Democrats say they are worried
the administration will allow the deficit to balloon for the
current fiscal year, now that it's too late to trigger automatic
spending cuts under the Gramm-Rudman Law.
   Later, when S&amp;L assets are sold and the working capital is
repaid, it would cut the budget deficit number and hide the true
scope of government spending, the Democrats maintain.
   ``It's the worst type of budget gimmickry,'' Schumer said. But
``it is a juicy morsel in the eyes of any person trying to make it
look like the budget was balanced.''
   Meanwhile, economists said the extra Treasury borrowing could,
at least temporarily, drive up short-term interest rates.
   Economist David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a government
securities dealer in New York, said consumers with adjustable-rate
home mortgages or home equity loans tied to the one-year Treasury
bill may see their payments take a jump.
   However, economist Elliott Platt of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette
Securities Corp. said any upset in interest rates would be
short-lived.
   ``Apart from a little short-term friction ... there's probably
going to be relatively little effect on interest rates overall,''
he said.
   Meanwhile, RTC oversight staff members said, at least for now,
two other more expensive methods of raising working capital won't
be used.
   In one, the government would solicit large,
government-guaranteed deposits for failed thrifts from
institutional investors such as pension funds. In the other, the
administration would borrow through the Federal Home Loan Bank
System, the quasi-governmental financing arm of the S&amp;L industry.
   Also, they said, the $44 billion estimate for working capital in
1990 does not include additional funds that could be used to pay
off high-cost deposits in failed thrifts controlled by the
government. The $11 billion estimate for this quarter includes
about $3 billion to pay off high-cost deposits, they said.

<HEAD>Coast Guard Chief `Delighted' With California Spill Cleanup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the Coast Guard says he's
satisfied with the cleanup of an oil spill off the California coast
despite a congressman's contention the service overstated its
readiness.
   ``I'm delighted with the cleanup,'' Adm. Paul A. Yost said
Thursday in an interview. ``I'll stand by the cleanup.''
   Yost made the comment after Rep. George Miller, D-Calif.,
charged that Yost last August said the Coast Guard was capable of
cleaning up far more than it actually did at the California spill.
   Miller said Yost told him in a letter that under ideal
conditions, 161,500 barrels of oil would have been recovered within
72 hours of a spill off Southern California.
   Miller said the cleanup of the Feb. 7 spill by the American
Trader, although much smaller than that of the Exxon Valdez in
Alaska last March, reached only 2,762 barrels four days later _ 2
percent of what the Coast Guard had estimated.
   The American Trader spilled 400,000 gallons _ about 9,500
barrels _ of crude oil as it tried to moor about two miles
offshore. The Exxon Valdez spilled more than 10 million gallons of
crude when it went aground.
   ``I think everything that could be mobilized was mobilized here
to deal with it,'' Miller said of the California spill, adding that
weather and other conditions were as close to ideal for a cleanup
as could be expected.
   ``All evidence would suggest that if you had a spill the size of
the Exxon Valdez off the Huntington Beach we'd probably be lynching
the executives of British Petroleum at this time,'' Miller said,
referring to the company that chartered the American Trader.
   Miller had asked the Coast Guard for its appraisal of the
cleanup capabilities off the California coast as a result of the
Exxon Valdez disaster, the nation's worst oil spill. Yost said that
model cannot be applied to the current spill.
   ``He asked for a benchmark,'' Yost said. ``I said in my answer
this was an unrealistic situation.''
   Yost said the two situations can't be compared because skimming
would be much easier with a larger spill, since the oil lies on the
ocean in much thicker layers.
   He added that in an ideal situation the water would be placid,
while in the California situation there was a ``slight chop.''
   ``We picked up 30 percent,'' he said. ``That's a higher
percentage of oil slick than in any large spill in history.''
   Miller, chairman of the House Interior subcommittee on water,
power and offshore energy resources, is trying to win passage of
oil spill liability legislation. House and Senate negotiators are
working on a compromise measure.
   The Coast Guard participates in and supervises oil spill
cleanups, but state and local governments and private industry
provide most of the capability. Resources include skimmers, barges,
helicopters, airplanes, fire booms and pumps.

<TEXT>
   President Bush and three Latin
American leaders agreed on a new drug-fighting strategy but steered
away from a disputed U.S. initiative during a tightly guarded
one-day summit.
   Bush said he and the leaders of the three largest
cocaine-producing nations formed the first ``anti-drug cartel,''
but a joint communique vowing closer coordination on the war on
drugs apparently ruled out expanding the use of U.S. military force
in Bolivia, Colombia and Peru to combat cocaine traffickers.
   ``Each country may involve its armed forces in this fight in its
own territory,'' said the communique, signed by Bush, Bolivia's
Jaime Paz Zamora, Colombia's Virgilio Barco and Peru's Alan Garcia.
   Latin leaders had opposed a U.S. plan to send a naval force to
interdict cocaine shipments in the international waters off
Colombia's coast.
   At the summit, Bush promised to step up the fight against U.S.
drug use and outlined emergency programs to help offset the
weakening of Peru's and Bolivia's economies as they fight to reduce
and eventually eliminate cultivation of coca, used to make cocaine.
   But Garcia later questioned if the United States could come up
with the money to pay for such expensive programs. ``Where's the
beef?'' he asked at the concluding news conference.
   Zamora, with a nod to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
sweeping reforms, said a new openness had been attained at the
summit. ``A perestroika has begun,'' he said.
   Extraordinary security precautions were taken to protect Bush
and his three summit partners, with about 5,000 uniformed troops
watching over the proceedings. Battleships presented an imposing
force off shore and helicopter gunships hovered nearby. Bush
returned to Washington late Thursday without incident.
   But Colombian guerrillas made their own point, one of defiance.
They kidnapped an American priest in Cali, the third U.S. citizen
taken prisoner by rebels this week. Also, a small bomb exploded
Thursday morning, 4{ miles from Barranquilla Airport, damaging a
voltage regulator of a line that fed the air conditioning of the
airport where Bush landed two hours later.
   At the summit, Bush met a key Latin American demand by promising
in the communique to fight cocaine consumption in his country.
   ``I owe it to the children of America, the United States ... to
these three presidents to guarantee them that we will do everything
we can to cut demand for narcotics in the United States,'' Bush
said.
   The four nations also promised to hold a follow-up meeting
within six months to review progress in the batttle against cocaine
and called for a 1991 world conference to address illegal drug
trafficking.
   The document proposed ``broad-based rural development'' to help
prevent the economic hardship that it admitted will inevitably
result from programs to substitute other crops for coca.
   The communique indicated that the United States was willing to
help finance programs to replenish the country's foreign exchange
and to help create jobs for farmers no longer able to grow the
illegal crop.
   ``The great result of the anti-drug summit for our countries is
the realization of the necessity of substituting a legal economy
for the current coca economy,'' Zamora said.
   In Bolivia's central Chapare region, an estimated 300,000
peasants make a living by growing the bush.
   Garcia has said repeatedly that many of the estimated 200,000
Peruvian peasants who survive by growing coca could be driven into
the camp of leftist rebels if their livelihood is taken away from
them.
   Colombia has frequently complained that while it is spilling its
blood fighting drug traffickers, the U.S. is discriminating against
its legal exports such as coffee and flowers with high tariffs and
other protective measures.
   Bush on Thursday tried to address those complaints by saying he
would work to open U.S. markets more.
   Bush did not promise any more aid to the Latin American
countries other than the $2.2 billion over the next five years he
had already pledged.
   However, the president, perhaps realizing the programs called
for in the communique would require additional funding, said he
would try to get Western European and other developed nations to
help foot the bill.
   He added that at the economic summit of developed nations July
9-11 in Houston he would try to place economic assistance for Latin
American drug producers high on the agenda.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The earthquake that walloped Northern
California in October triggered a four-foot-high tsunami, a huge
undersea landslide and a feeding frenzy by fish in Monterey Bay,
scientists say.
   Towns along the bay were lucky the the tsunami, or quake-caused
sea wave, occurred near low tide because if the jolt had come at
high tide, ``there could have been problems,'' oceanographer Frank
Schwing said Thursday in a telephone interview.
   The tsunami, which measured as much as four feet from crest to
trough, moved through the bay at 67 mph just after the quake struck
Oct. 17, said Schwing, of the National Marine Fisheries Service in
Monterey.
   Submarine landslides _ including one two-by-five-miles in size _
suddenly exposed buried worms, tiny crustaceans and other
creatures, attracting flatfish, rockfish and deep-sea perch, he
said.
   A small unmanned submarine placed in the bay two weeks after the
quake found the fish ``appeared to be engaging in a `feeding
frenzy' on the newly exposed ... organisms,'' Schwing and others
wrote in a study published in the current issue of Eos, an American
Geophysical Union publication.
   The 7.1 magnitude earthquake was centered on the San Andreas
Fault about 10 miles northeast of Santa Cruz, on the north side of
Monterey Bay, which is about 70 miles south of San Francisco.
   The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake killed 62 people,
injured 3,757, left 12,053 homeless and caused more than $6 billion
in damage in the greater San Francisco Bay region. Other estimates
reported greater damage.
   Tsunamis, which are often incorrectly called tidal waves, are
sudden rises and drops in sea level that sometimes make giant waves
crash onto a coastline.
   As the earthquake was unleashed, the sea level in Santa Cruz
Harbor dropped about three feet as water rushed out of the harbor,
probably because the tremor lifted underlying ground upward by
about four to eight inches, Schwing said.
   ``People standing there actually saw the water go out,'' he
said. ``There was some evidence boats actually hit bottom.''
   After the sea levels dropped, they rose again by about three to
four feet, Schwing said. Sea levels at Monterey, on the bay's south
side, dropped about one foot, then rose by 1.5 feet, he said.
   The tsunami took about 20 minutes to travel the approximate 24
miles from Santa Cruz to Monterey, he said.
   Water sloshed back and forth across the bay every half hour for
24 hours after the jolt, rising and falling about one foot, he
added.
   ``It's analogous to having a tub of water, and if you strike the
side of the tub, the water is going to bounce back and forth,''
Schwing said.
   He said the tsunami and sloshing were much smaller than the
normal tidal variation in Monterey Bay, but the tsunami could have
caused damage if it had happened at high tide.
   Ground failure, or liquefaction, on the bay floor caused
numerous underwater landslides, including the two-by-five-mile
slide about 1.5 miles west of Moss Landing. The ground slid into
Monterey Submarine Canyon, an underwater canyon about as deep and
wide as the Grand Canyon, Schwing said.
   Schwing co-authored the study with Jerry Norton, also at the
National Marine Fisheries Service, and Cindy Pilskaln, of the
Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in Pacific Grove.

   Worried that his constituents might lick
or kiss a South American toad to get at the hallucinogenic toxin it
secretes, a legislator has introduced a bill making it illegal to
get high on cane toads.
   ``It's the latest wave'' in hallucinating, said Rep. Pat Harris,
citing the Drug Enforcement Administration's recent toad-licking
alert.
   Harris said Thursday he has not heard of instances of cane
toad-licking in South Carolina, although he said it was potentially
an explosive phenomenon. ``Crack could pale'' in significance, he
joked.
   ``They say these frogs grow to the size of a dinner plate. I
don't want to see somebody walk across the Statehouse grounds with
a frog on a leash and pick him up and lick him.''
   Harris admitted his bill was good for nothing more than a laugh.
   ``It's a kind of tongue-in-cheek deal,'' the 78-year-old real
estate executive said. ``Kind of tongue-on-the-frog deal.''
   Cane toads, endemic to South America, produce a toxin called
bufotenine to ward off predators. When licked raw, or cooked, the
toxin acts as a hallucinogen.
   Asked if he would consider kissing a cane toad to hallucinate,
Harris replied, ``Oh no, no. No. I'd rather drink a lot of liquor.''

   A full-time policeman, part-time inventor has
invented a tweezer-like gadget that puts the pinch on crime.
   The tiny aluminum pincers invented by Officer Robert Mika can be
squeezed against an earlobe or finger, especially the pinky, to
inflict pain without causing permanent injury.
   Dubbed the ``Mika Come-Along,'' the badged creator sees it as a
public relations-conscious alternative to clubs, stun guns and
martial arts weapons.
   The pincers can be held discreetly in the palm of the hand. They
are being evaluated for use by the police department, officials
said.
   ``Image is important in police work,'' said Mika, a 16-year
department veteran.
   ``You don't want something that looks too militaristic or has
high visibility,'' he said. ``You don't want something that gives
the image of overkill.''
   The pincers are the latest gadget Mika has produced in the
workshop at his suburban Woodland Hills home.
   About 6,000 officers have a ``Mika Pocket Holster,'' which
prevents guns from snagging on pants pockets when drawn. About
3,000 have ordered the ``Mika Pocket Mirror,'' which has a fold-out
handle that can be used to peek around street and corridor corners
during pursuits and searches.

<HEAD>Mouse Model for Human Leukemia May Help Fight Killer Disease,
Experts Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers report today they have succeeded
in giving a form of human leukemia to laboratory mice, producing an
animal that now can be used to test therapies against the disease.
   ``With this new animal model, experimental therapies that might
otherwise be tried in human patients can now be tested in these
mice,'' said George Daley, lead researcher in the study conducted
at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Cambridge,
Mass.
   ``You obviously can do more with the mice than you could with
human patients,'' he said.
   The study, published today in Science, says the Whitehead
researchers used intricate genetic engineering to inject into the
bone marrow of laboratory mice the human gene linked to chronic
myelogenous leukemia (CML), a form of a blood cancer that usually
attacks adults and is only rarely cured.
   Daley said the study also proves CML is initiated by the fusion
of parts from two broken chromosomes, a finding that was suggested
by earlier studies in other laboratories. Those parts have been
identified as the so-called ABL gene from chromosome 9 and a gene
called BCR from chromosome 22.
   Cells containing this hybrid gene produce a protein, called
P210, that changes healthy cells into cancer cells.
   Daley said his study showed that transferring the BCR@ABL gene
into mouse bone marrow and then putting these infected cells into
healthy mice could produce CML in those mice.
   ``It answers a question of basic science, that is, what causes
the disease,'' said Daley. ``We now know that the BCR@ABL gene is
sufficient to induce the leukemia.''
   He said it is still not known precisely what causes the two
chromosomes to break and create the hybrid gene, but a high
exposure to radiation is thought to be a factor.
   Dr. George Canellos, chief of medical oncology at the
Dana-Farber Institute in Boston, said the Whitehead finding is ``an
important advance in understanding the disease.''
   He said the new animal model of the disease may help scientists
find ways to block the action of the P210 protein produced by the
BCR@ABL gene, thus preventing the disease.
   ``In screening biological substances, it will make a very nice
model,'' said Canellos.
   Daley said the mouse can be used to test ``biological
inhibitors'' that would prevent the P210 protein from transforming
normal cells into cancers. Such inhibitors formally could only be
tested on human patients, a process that could take years. With a
mouse model of the disease, experiments can be sped up and can be
more extensive.
   To create the mouse model, Daley said he and his colleagues
inserted the human BCR@ABL gene into a virus. Normal mouse bone
marrow cells were then exposed to the virus, which transferred the
gene into the marrow cells.
   Thirty healthy mice were then irradiated to kill their bone
marrow cells. Next, the bone marrow carrying the BCR@ABL gene was
transplanted into the 30 mice.
   Within five months, 13 of the 30 mice developed a blood disease
that mimicked human chronic myelogenous leukemia.
   CML in humans can be controlled by chemotherapy for 3 to 5
years. This remission period usually ends with the sudden increase
in abnormal cells, a disease phase called ``blast crisis'' that
usually results in death. The only successful therapy used now is
to kill the diseased bone marrow in the patient and replace it with
healthy bone marrow from a compatible donor, but even this
treatment often fails.
   Daley said that continued studies of the CML mice show that many
of the laboratory animals develop the ``blast crisis'' phase of the
disease. This, he said, is further verification that the course of
the disease in the mice mimics CML in humans.
   Richard A. Van Etten and David Baltimore, both of the Whitehead
Institute, were coauthors of the study with Daley. Science, which
published the study, is the journal of the American Association for
the Advancement of Science.

   The dollar rose slightly against the yen Friday,
while the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange edged down.
   The dollar finished the week in Tokyo at 144.55 yen, up 0.10 yen
from Thursday's close of 144.45 yen. After opening at 144.80 yen,
it ranged between 144.55 yen and 144.95 yen during the day.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, which rose 316.10 points Thursday, shed 11.67 points, or
0.03 percent, closing the week at 37,460.32.
   Currency dealers said the dollar-yen exchange rate remained in a
narrow range ahead of the release of U.S. trade figures for
December, due out later Friday.
   They also said market players were taking a wait-and-see stance
before Sunday's general election for Japan's lower house of
Parliament.
   ``It's a see-saw game,'' said Shinji Tanaka, a dealer with
Mitsui Bank.
   Japanese news media predicted this week the governing Liberal
Democratic Party will retain a majority in the 512-member House of
Representatives. An unpopular sales tax and a series of scandals
have kindled discontent with the Liberal Democrats, leading some to
forecast that they might lose their majority in parliament.

<HEAD>Behavior Changes Needed to Stem AIDS Spread, Federal Panel Told</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLISON J. PUGH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Even the best advances in the laboratory won't
stem the AIDS epidemic unless people infected with the HIV virus
change their sexual behavior, researchers told a federal commission
on the disease.
   ``Behavior is always the problem,'' said Dr. John W. Ward of the
national Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. ``Look at smoking.
People still smoke, in spite of peer pressure and such. It always
comes down to the individual, to what benefit there is to the
individual to change the behavior.''
   On Thursday, Ward and other AIDS experts in academia, government
and medicine addressed a working group of the National Commission
on AIDS, a panel appointed by President Bush and Congress to make
national policy recommendations.
   The group was meeting for a two-day conference focusing on
testing for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, and early
intervention. The group is to present its findings to the full
commission next month in Washington, D.C.
   Paul Cleary, a Harvard associate professor of health care, said
AIDS testing may improve steadily and at first may seem to be a way
to address the epidemic because it identifies the afflicted.
   But the emotional costs to those who test positive for HIV and
the social costs of some forms of testing make testing a policy the
nation should approach cautiously, Cleary said.
   Counseling, which can help people absorb the implications of
their HIV infection and take steps to stop its spread, is too often
excluded altogether from AIDS testing, speakers at the conference
agreed.
   Panel members said patients react in dramatic and often tragic
ways when they learn their blood contains the HIV virus. They spoke
of patients who refused to change their behavior or tell their
sexual partners, and of others who killed themselves.
   Others suppress the news, Cleary said.
   ``We all work with persons with whom the information is not
used,'' he said.
   Adequate counseling can inform people who test positive of the
possibility of false results, tell them of the treatments available
that often delay the onset of complications, and help them
understand the potential consequences of their infection, the
speakers said.
   In addition, however, support services can help patients take
steps to alter the behavior that may have got them the infection,
to ensure that its spread ends there.
   ``The first step is giving people information, saying `If you
care about people, about the people you love, your family, you
don't want to spread the deadly infection to them,'' said Ward, the
special assistant for science in the deputy director's office at
the CDC.
   About 1 million Americans are believed to be infected with the
HIV virus, said Dr. Alan R. Hinman of the CDC. About 200,000 of
those have been tested and are aware of their infection, he said.

<HEAD>New Study Shows No Racial Bias In California Criminal Sentencing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The authors of a study published today say
California is succeeding in eliminating racial bias in the
sentencing of felons to prison.
   Joan Petersilia, a Rand Corp. researcher who co-wrote the report
appearing today in the journal Science, said it shows race plays no
role in determining how long a convicted felon goes to prison in
California.
   She said the study shows California's Determinate Sentencing Act
``almost means sentencing by computer.''
   Various factors, such as the type and seriousness of the crime
and the defendant's prior record, are used to determine a
sentencing score, she said.
   ``If you get a certain score, then you go to prison unless the
judge can give a very good explanation of why you will be an
exception,'' she said.
   This has ``worked to the advantage of racial minorities,'' Ms.
Petersilia said. ``The system just doesn't have the discretion that
it once had and as the discretion went away, so did the opportunity
for racial prejudice in the sentencing decision.''
   Ms. Petersilia wrote a 1983 study that found racial bias in the
California sentencing system. But she says now that conclusion was
in error. She said judges told her the earlier study was flawed
because it didn't take into account all the factors judges must
consider in sentencing decisions.
   She said the earlier study looked at 15 factors affecting the
sentence, but the new report was the result of studying 60 factors.
When those 60 factors were studied, ``the addition of the
individual's race made no difference,'' she said.
   Factors considered included such things as whether a weapon was
used, how badly the victim was hurt, whether an accomplice was
involved, and the precise role of the offender in the crime.
   Ms. Petersilia said the new study analyzed the records of 11,553
California offenders who were convicted in 1980 of assault,
robbery, burglary, theft, forgery or drug crimes. Probation usually
is not a possibility in more serious crimes, such as murder, so
that type of offense was not analyzed, she said.
   The racial distribution in California's prisons is significantly
out of balance when compared to the general population, but the
researcher said the criminal justice system is not to blame.
   Blacks make up about 34 percent of the California prison
population and about 7 percent of the general population in the
state. Hispanics are 19 percent of the state population and are 23
percent of the prison population. Whites are 74 percent of the
general population and 33 percent of those in prison.
   ``What this study shows is that it is not a racist criminal
justice system,'' said Ms. Petersilia. She said the solution to the
racial imbalance in the prisons must be found in the communities.
   Coauthors of the study with Ms. Petersilia were Stephen Klein
and Susan Turner. All are researchers in the criminal justice
program of the Rand Corporation, a Santa Monica, Calif., firm.
   Science, which published the study, is the journal of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science.

<TEXT>
   Soviet troops will begin leaving
Czechoslovakia in 10 days and an agreement on complete withdrawal
from Hungary may come within a month, officials say.
   Soviet soldiers arrived in Hungary to suppress the 1956
anti-Stalinist uprising and in Czechoslovakia to crush the ``Prague
Spring'' political liberalization of 1968.
   With the first free general elections in more than 40 years
nearing, Hungary and Czechoslovakia are on the threshold of full
democracy and see removal of Soviet forces as a symbolic
affirmation of independence.
   Gen. Anton Slimak, Czechoslovak chief of staff, said Thursday
the Soviet withdrawal would begin next week in Bruntal, 160 miles
east of Prague, the official news agency CTK reported.
   Later, however, CTK said Soviet and Czechoslovak delegations
meeting in Prague agreed the withdrawal would begin Feb. 26, the
day President Vaclav Havel starts his first visit to Moscow.
   Czechoslovakia had sought withdrawal of all 73,500 Red Army
troops by the end of this year, but Slimak said that would not
happen. Moscow wants to have until the end of 1991, and sources in
Prague said earlier this week that June 1991 was a likely
compromise.
   No final date was agreed at Thursday's talks in Prague, but
talks will continue to nail that down, CTK said.
   In Budapest, a senior Hungarian official was quoted Thursday as
predicting agreement within a month on ending decades of Soviet
military presence.
   Magyar Nemzet, a Hungarian daily, quoted Foreign Ministry
official Ferenc Somogyi as saying Hungary could ``count on working
out the agreement within a month.''
   Czechoslovakia has insisted the Soviets withdraw, whatever the
results of East-West talks in Vienna on reducing conventional
forces in Europe, but Hungary has not.
   Officials on both sides appear confident of conventional forces
agreement this year, now that the Soviets have accepted President
Bush's proposal to reduce the number of U.S. and Soviet soldiers in
Central Europe to 195,000 for each side.
   Hungary wants all 50,000 Soviet soldiers off its territory by
early 1991, but Somogyi said compromise was possible because of
Kremlin concerns about transportation and providing facilities for
the returning soldiers.
   ``We have to take into account our negotiating partner's
position,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Slimak said withdrawal from Czechoslovakia could not be
completed by the end of 1990 for technical and social reasons.
   A preliminary agreement indicates about 35 percent of the
soldiers will be withdrawn by the end of May, along with 40 percent
of the tanks, 30 percent of other combat vehicles and nearly one
third of helicopters and artillery, Slimak said.
   Czechoslovakia has asked that a substantial part of the Soviet
forces be out before elections scheduled for June.

<HEAD>Government Lawyers Attack Keating Claims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The top aide to Charles H. Keating Jr. says
government regulators were responsible for Keating's Lincoln
Savings and Loan Co. losing a $9 million profit from a stock deal.
   Government lawyers attacked the claims Thursday, saying Keating
never meant for Lincoln to reap all the profits from the
transaction, a centerpiece of the allegation that Keating illegally
used the $5.5 billion thrift's federally insured deposits to make
risky investments in junk bonds and finance his Arizona real estate
empire.
   Regulators say taxpayers could have to pay up to $2 billion to
cover Lincoln's losses, making it the costliest of more than 500
thrift failures the past two years.
   The transaction, which involved Memorex stock, came in the week
after the Oct. 19, 1987, ``Black Monday'' stock market crash.
   In the 12th day of a hearing on Keating's lawsuit to undo the
federal takeover of Lincoln in April, his top aide testified
Lincoln could not have bought back 79,275 shares of Memorex it sold
four months earlier without violating a promise to regulators to
buy no more stock.
   Judith Wischer, president of Lincoln's holding company, American
Continental Corp., said the pledge was made at an Oct. 21, 1987,
meeting with regulators.
   Because of that, Wischer told U.S. District Court Judge Stanley
Sporkin, she and other top executives of Lincoln and American
Continental decided Oct. 23 to have the parent company buy the
stock rather than have Lincoln repurchase it from Tucson
stockbroker and developer Ernest C. Garcia.
   Regulators in the Treasury Department's Office of Thrift
Supervision and former Federal Home Loan Bank Board have denied any
such pledge was made at the Oct. 21 meeting.
   Government lawyers Thursday presented a deed of transfer of the
Memorex stock from Garcia to American Continental signed by
Lincoln's president, Bruce Dickson, and dated Oct. 21 _ two days
before Mrs. Wischer said the decision was made.
   ``The date is not the correct date,'' Mrs. Wischer said. ``I
don't know why the dates differ. The transaction was agreed to late
Friday night or Monday morning (Oct. 23 or Oct. 26).''
   Dickson, who also was a senior vice president of American
Continental, has refused to testify on Keating's suit, claiming a
Fifth Amendment constitutional protection against
self-incrimination.
   A federal grand jury in Los Angeles is considering possible
criminal charges against officials of Lincoln and American
Continental.
   Government attorneys contend the Oct. 21 deed is evidence that
Keating never intended for Lincoln to take all the profits from the
Memorex stock and that the purchase through American Continental
was an illegal ``usurpation of corporate opportunity.''
   They also cited Lincoln's purchases of $19 million in stock in
November and another $17 million in December as evidence that
Lincoln was continuing to invest in equities despite claims by its
officials they had promised regulators they would not.
   Lincoln acquired the Memorex stock for $1 a share in December
1986 as a ``sweetener'' to its purchase of $40 million in junk
bonds yielding 14 percent interest that were financing British
investor James Goldsmith's takeover move on the Dutch computer
company.
   The bonds were sold the following April and May at a $1.5
million profit to Lincoln. The thrift then sought from regulators,
but was effectively denied, permission to sell the stock for $2.8
million to American Continental.
   In June 1987, Lincoln sold the stock to Garcia for $1 million _
about $12.50 a share _ with an option to buy it back for $4.25
million, or about $53.50 per share.

   Doris Hagberg's mother spoke to her
this week, more than 20 years after her death.
   The voice came through scratchy but excited on a record made in
1937, atop the Empire State Building, that Mrs. Hagber set aside
until she found a special wooden needle to play the souvenir.
   ``All these years I've been thinking about it,'' she said before
she found a windup Victrola and wooden needle.
   Every now and then Mrs. Hagberg, who is 68, would look at the
record and wonder what message her mother had recorded during that
New York vacation. The hitch was the needle: an inch-long, clamp-in
stylus.
   She searched record stores and antique shops around her home in
Port Angeles, a city of 17,000 across from Victoria, Canada, on the
Juan de Fuca Strait.
   She wrote letters to stores in Seattle and traveled across the
Puget Sound to rummage through record collections and thrift shops
in that city. She even asked relatives to search in Los Angeles.
   Nowhere could she find the right needle.
   She looked again at the envelope her mother used to mail the
five-inch silver disc.
   ``It said `Empire State Observatory,' and that was the only
place I could think of to try that I hadn't.''
   She wrote a letter in January adressed to ``Whoever'' at the
building, asking for help.
   Observatory director Laura Fries forwarded Mrs. Hagberg's letter
to The New York Times, and it appeared in that paper's
``Metropolitan Diary'' column.
   Ms. Fries reported getting more than 50 calls offering needles
or suggesting alternatives such as toothpicks, rose thorns and
cactus spines.
   She sent a couple of needles by Federal Express, and Mrs.
Hagberg arranged with the Clallam County Museum in Port Angeles to
use their 1918-vintage Victrola to play the record.
   On Valentine's Day, the late Ella Goller spoke to her daughter
once more.
   On hand were former museum director Virginia Fitzpatrick and Bob
Blake, a recording studio technician who brought a portable
four-track recorder to capture the record's sound in case it was
damaged in the playing.
   Blake set his recording levels. Mrs. Fitzpatrick clamped the
needle in place, cranked the metal arm at the side of the four-foot
phonograph cabinet and set wood to groove.
   Mrs. Hagberg leaned close from her seat beside the cabinet and
listened. Out came a scratchy, barely audible female voice. None of
those present could make the message out.
   Mrs. Fitzpatrick tried another needle, and the voice came out
again, not much louder but clear enough to make out this:
   ``Having a grand time...''
   Mrs. Hagberg repeated the words.
   The record was played again, and the words ``There's so much to
do'' could be heard.
   The voice on the record giggled, and Mrs. Hagberg's eyes
brightened with a memory of the time her mother left for a
monthlong New York trip in 1937, leaving her, then 16, with her
father.
   ``I remember my dad making chow mein with venison, and burning
it when she was gone. The night she went I was babysitting and I
locked myself out of the house.'' She smiled.
   Not much else could be gathered from the record, but Blake's
recorder cleared up some of the crackling.
   ``One could spend the entire day here, there's so much to see,''
Mrs. Goller said on Blake's enhanced recording. ``The buildings
look just like towers down in the street.''

   One of Chang-Lin Tien's earliest memories
of America is a segregated drinking fountain he saw in Kentucky.
   That memory could be a portent of what awaits Tien as chancellor
of the University of California-Berkeley, which has been wracked by
controversies over minority admissions and faculty hiring.
   At a news conference Thursday to announce his selection as
Berkeley chancellor by the UC Board of Regents, Tien indicated
prejudice was still very much on his mind.
   ``You maintain and enhance academic leadership through
excellence and primarily diversity, which means in all levels _
students, faculty, staff, campus life in general,'' said Tien, a
54-year-old Chinese immigrant.
   In his only reference to ongoing disputes between students and
administration over issues affecting minorities, Tien said he
believed the university had taken ``very positive steps and has
good momentum'' toward resolving those problems. He would not
otherwise comment.
   University officials believe Tien is the first person of Asian
ancestry to head a major U.S. university.
   Rep. Norm Mineta, D-San Jose, a Japanese-American, praised
Tien's selection.
   ``For Americans of Asian ancestry in particular, Dr. Tien's
appointment represents a milestone not only because he is the first
Asian American to head a UC campus, but also because of the campus
he will lead.''
   Berkeley's academic standards generally are considered the
highest among the nine University of California campuses.
   Tien, chosen over 250 others, assumes the $165,000-per-year job
on July 1. He will become Berkeley's seventh chancellor since the
position was created in 1952.
   He came to the United States in 1955 after earning a bachelor's
degree at National Taiwan University. He received his doctorate
from Princeton University in 1959, the same year he joined the
Berkeley faculty.
   Tien, an internationally recognized authority in heat transfer
technology, stayed at Berkeley for 29 years before becoming
executive vice chancellor at UC-Irvine 18 months ago. At Berkeley
he served three years as vice chancellor of research and seven
years as chairman of the mechanical engineering department.
   His list of high honors is long: a member of the National
Academy of Engineers, his field's most prestigious professional
association; a winner of the distinguished teaching award at
Berkeley; and awards for his scholarship in West Germany, Japan and
China.
   The new honor, the chancellor position, will be ``one of the
greatest challenges in the world,'' said Ira Michael Heyman, who is
retiring from the post June 30 after 10 years.
   ``Berkeley is a place where you always walk on eggs,'' Heyman
said. ``I hope he will scope out some major things he wants to work
on and not get mired down in administrative details, which is so
difficult.''
   At Irvine, Tien was widely liked because of his efforts to
include faculty in greater administrative roles, a highly
contentious issue at the Berkeley campus.
   The high-profile Berkeley campus, recognized not only for its
academic performances but also its history of student political
protest, has 32,000 students and 11,000 faculty and staff
employees. It is considered the most ethnically diverse major
university in the nation.
   The campus has been divided in recent years over charges of
racism by both black and Asian students.
   In 1982, 63.2 percent of undergraduates were white; that dropped
to this year's 45 percent of the 22,000 students. Asians are the
largest minority group with 27 percent of the undergraduates, while
Hispanics account for 13 percent and blacks 8 percent.
   After months of debate, the faculty adopted an ethnic studies
requirement that reflects the racially diverse student body and
promotes tolerance.
   The school also next year will begin using new admissions
criteria that eliminate quotas. The change was supported by Asian
groups, who considered the quotas biased against them.
   The school also has been accused of not being aggressive enough
in recruiting minority faculty. Law students last year demanded an
immediate freeze on the hiring of non-minority law professors.

<HEAD>White Opposition Demands President de Klerk Resign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY RENFREW</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The opposition Conservative Party
charged today that President F.W. de Klerk was spreading fear among
whites with his plans to share power with blacks and called for his
immediate resignation.
   The right-wing party issued the call after thousands of its
supporters marched through Pretoria Thursday night in a major show
of strength to demand new elections. Police said today that up to
40,000 whites took part in the march.
   De Klerk's decision to free black leader Nelson Mandela and
legalize the African National Congress had created fear and
uncertainty among South African whites, the party said in a
statement in its newspaper, Die Patriot.
   ``With one stroke great uncertainty about the future has been
created. The voters have been lied to too often,'' the statement
said.
   Marchers carried placards saying ``Hang F.W. de Klerk'' and
``Keep South Africa White'' as they marched to City Hall for a
rally at which Conservative leader Andries Treurnicht warned the
government faces a growing white backlash.
   Treurnicht told the cheering crowd that De Klerk had betrayed
whites ``by granting people with revolutionary aims, and who want
to enslave others by means of violence, freedom of movement and the
right to organize.''
   ``It's an injustice against the nation.''
   The march and rally kicked off the party's campaign to try and
force elections to oust de Klerk for freeing Mandela on Sunday and
legalizing black opposition groups. De Klerk wants to end
white-minority rule and negotiate on sharing power with blacks to
bring peace to South Africa.
   The Conservatives have threatened to stage strikes if de Klerk
ignores its demand to resign.
   Many signs at the rally called for creation of a separate white
state excluding blacks.
   Hundreds of uniformed stormtroopers of the neo-Nazi Afrikaneer
Resistance Party joined the march with swastika flags and signs
saying, ``Hang Mandela.'' Some stormtroopers hanged a small black
doll representing Mandela and others marched with a severed black
dolls head mounted on a stake.
   But most of the participants were conservative middle-class and
working- class whites. Hundreds of women and children took part in
the march.
   ``We want to stay a nation of whites. We're going to fight to
stay a nation on our own,'' said Ter Schumann, one of the marchers.
``We are going to stay a white nation.''
   Local observers said the turnout was an impressive show of
strength for the Conservative Party, which won 31 percent of the
white vote in elections last September. Dozens of buses from
surrounding towns brought people into Pretoria for the march.
   The Conservatives demands the creation of separate white and
black states. It claims whites and blacks cannot live together
because of their different cultural values.
   About 5 million whites live in South Africa, with 28 million
blacks and 4 million people who are mixed-race or Indian.
   Mandela, 71, said Thursday that the ANC ``would like to move
away from the situation of conflict and confrontation'' but the
government must end its 3{-year-old state of emergency and free all
political prisoners before direct talks with the government could
begin.
   Mandela also said his movement considers government facilities
legitimate targets and will continue attacking them until South
Africa's white leaders negotiate an agreement on racial equality.
   He was arrested in 1962 and had been serving a life sentence for
planning the start of the ANC's sabotage campaign against the
government.

<HEAD>35 Million Americans Have Arthritis; 6 Million Won't See Doctor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal health officials are at a loss to explain
why about 6 million Americans who complain of arthritis will not
see a doctor about it.
   The national Centers for Disease Control said Thursday in a new
survey that 35 million Americans, or 14.6 percent of the
population, reported having arthritis, but only about 29 million
had consulted a doctor.
   ``These findings indicate the need ... to determine why these
persons have not sought medical care, and to identify approaches
for overcoming barriers to care,'' the CDC said in its weekly
report.
   Dr. Arthur Grazel, senior vice president for medical affairs at
the Arthritis Foundation, said the report ``confirms our suspicions
that many people think they can treat arthritis themselves.''
Prolonged arthritis without medical care can lead to irreversible
joint damage, Grazel said.
   Foundation spokesman Steve Erickson said there ``is a real big
misconception'' that only over-the-counter pain medication is
useful in treating the ailment.
   The warning signs of arthritis include joint swelling, early
morning stiffness, recurring joint pain or inability to move a
joint that lasts for more than two weeks, he said.
   The survey of 3,000 people taken in 1987 found higher rates of
arthritis in women than men, with the rate of incidence increasing
with age. For people over the age of 75, the rate was 53 percent.
   The report also said that overall, 3 percent reported arthritis
was limiting their activities. Race had no statistical relevance as
a factor in people reporting arthritis. The rates were 15 percent
for whites and 14 percent for blacks.

<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The country's first popularly elected
prime minister is battling political infighting, corruption and
possibly meddling by the military that could bring down his
government.
   In this land where military coups were once as dependable as the
monsoon rains, Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan's chief rival is
an officer who insists democracy is here to stay.
   ``One scandal after another has hit his coalition government. He
has muddled through so far _ but he is no James Bond,'' a leading
newspaper editor, Suthichai Yoon, wrote recently of Chatichai.
   While not quite in the league of the indestructible, fictional
spy, Chatichai's image of a party-loving and energetic leader
initially spurred his popularity. He also earned the nickname of
``Mr. No Problem'' for insisting that his immediate political
problems and the deeper ones afflicting Thailand could easily be
handled.
   But problems are now piling up for this longtime pro-Western
country and for Chatichai's 18-month-old government.
   Last month, Bangkok's vital river port was closed down by a
four-day strike amid allegations of military involvement.
   In addition, police allegations have linked a senator and former
economic adviser to Chatichai, Kitti Damnernchanvanich, to
large-scale illegal logging in Thailand's ravaged forests.
   These and other problems are being vigorously exploited _ if not
partially orchestrated _ by political opponents.
   They have also created splits both within the six-party
governing coalition and Chatichai's own Chart Thai Party.
   Local editors and other anlaysts have talked of a possible
Cabinet change. Others have predicted dissolution of Parliament
when it reconvenes in May, followed by elections that could oust
68-year-old Chatichai before his term expires in 1992.
   The army commander, Gen. Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, is widely seen
as a rival or successor to Chatichai.
   The general has indicated he will retire from the military in
April and enter civilian politics.
   Chavalit personally intervened to settle the port strike,
leading to speculation the military had orchestrated the whole
thing to enhance its image.
   This was a tactic frequently used in past decades, when coups by
military strongmen determined who ruled Thailand. But Chavalit
denied involvement in the strike and has frequently stated that the
days of coup-making are over.
   Chavalit's accession to power _ through democratic means or
otherwise _ would probably have little effect on Thailand's general
course. In recent years, one ruling clique has replaced the next
while the country itself has remained pro-Western, capitalist and
respectful of the constitutional monarchy.
   Corruption has remained entrenched in the system. But some
academics, political opposition figures and other critics claim the
Chatichai government has sunk to a new low.
   ``Allegedly, cronyism has been a prominent feature of the
present system. Indeed one is reminded of the Marcos regime,''
wrote political scientist Likhit Dhiravegin recently, referring to
the toppled Philippine government of the late Ferdinand Marcos.
   ``It is estimated that 10 to 15 businesss groups rallying around
the power center have hastily taken the opportunity to exploit the
gold mine.''

<HEAD>Haitians: Blood Donation Policy is Racist</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Haitian community leaders dismissed
as racist a new federal policy prohibiting Haitians and sub-Saharan
Africans from donating blood because of the high incidence of AIDS
in their home countries.
   The policy announced this month by the Food and Drug
Administration requires blood collection agencies regulated by the
FDA to refuse blood from donors who were born in, or emigrated from
those countries.
   The decision is based on the high incidence of Africans and
Haitians infected with the AIDS virus through heterosexual contact,
which ``seems to play a major role in transmitting the virus,''
according to the FDA.
   ``We still have the stigma then, that we are carriers of AIDS,''
said Chantal Thomas, executive director of the Haitian American
Community Center in West Palm Beach. ``It is insulting, how dare
they do something like that?''
   FDA spokesman Brad Stone defended the rule.
   ``We can understand how individuals from Haiti would be upset by
this policy. In many cases they probably won't have it, but right
now this is the only fairly reliable method we have to protect the
blood supply,'' Stone said.
   Most of the other groups in the United States considered to be
high risk _ intravenous drug users, homosexuals and prostitutes _
are discouraged from donating blood.
   But ``it seems that in Haiti and other countries the roots of
transmission may be different,'' Stone said. ``That makes it very
hard, at this point, to set up criteria for self deferral...
   ``We are not happy with this, we understand the sensitivities,
nor is the policy an indictment of the Haitian people or in any way
a racial policy,'' Stone said.
   Joseph Fanfan, a Fort Lauderdale doctor with a family practice,
blasted the decision.
   ``You can't just consider an ethnic group or nationality as
being a risk group,'' said Fanfan, former chairman of the Haitian
American Community Organization of Broward County Inc. ``Sexual
promiscuity is being practiced by a lot of people and is not
inherent in just one group of people.''
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a deadly disease caused
by a virus carried in the blood. It is spread through the use of
infected hypodermic needles and sex.
   For reasons that are not clear, AIDS was first diagnosed in the
United States mainly in the gay community and among Haitian
immigrants.
   A previous FDA policy permitted donations from Haitians and
sub-Saharan Africans if they came to this country before 1977.
   But ``the more we looked into AIDS we found that 1977 is a
fairly good year to pinpoint its start in the United States but it
may not be a good year to pinpoint in other parts of the world.''
Stone said.

<HEAD>Survey Finds Doubts About Social Security Benefits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly half of working American adults do not
believe Social Security will be able to pay them benefits when they
retire, a survey says.
   The December survey of 1,001 adults found that 49 percent of
those who had not yet retired were confident Social Security would
be able to pay them benefits, 47 percent did not expect to get
benefits and 4 percent were unsure.
   The survey released Thursday by The Gallup Organization was
commissioned by the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a
non-profit, non-partisan research group.
   Dallas Salisbury, the institute's president, said the results
indicate people are ``unrealistically pessimistic'' about the
Social Security system and have not been well educated about how it
works.
   Salisbury said confidence in Social Security could drop further
as public debate continues on a proposal by Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y., to cut Social Security taxes to keep the
government from using Social Security revenue for general
government operations.
   The debate ``is bringing into question the ability of the system
to pay future benefits,'' Salisbury said.
   President Bush has criticized the Moynihan proposal and claims
that it could jeopardize benefits for future retirees.
   The survey found that confidence in Social Security benefits was
highest among those closest to retirement, with 76 percent of those
aged 55 and older expecting to receive benefits compared with 46
percent of those aged 18-34.

<HEAD>Car Wax Recalled Due to Defective Containers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the nation's largest manufacturers of
car cleaning products has recalled about 200,000 cans of a new car
wax because the containers may rupture and cause injury.
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission said Thursday that
Connecticut-based SIMONIZ recalled its ``Quick Gloss'' car wax
after three incidents in which container corrosion caused a
build-up of pressure that ruptured the cans. No injuries were
reported.
   However, CPSC spokesman Dan Rumelt said various parts, including
the metal dome, may separate from the container and cause injury.
   The agency said approximately 200,000 cans of ``Quick Gloss''
were sold nationwide since February 1989.
   Consumers should spray the wax into trash cans away from any
open flame and immediately dispose of the metal containers, the
CPSC said, warning consumers not to puncture, incinerate or use a
trash compactor in disposing of the cans.
   Consumers should call 1-800-243-6400 for information on how to
receive a refund.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most companies targeted by animal rights
groups for their use of animal testing in consumer product research
have significantly reduced their use of animals, according to a
private study.
   However, a leading animal rights group said it wants
corporations to release internal information to back up the
findings.
   ``I would challenge the companies to substantiate the claims
that the numbers are down,'' said Susan Rich, special projects
director for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, the
nation's largest animal rights group.
   ``By looking at the figures of animal use in their in-house
laboratories does not give us the true picture,'' Rich said.
   The report released Thursday by the Investor Responsibility
Research Center examines data submitted to the Agriculture
Department by U.S. companies reporting animal use in fiscal years
1986, 1987 and 1988.
   It also offers in-depth profiles of animal testing from 1984-88
of nine companies that introduced shareholder resolutions on animal
testing after being targeted by PETA.
   The study shows six of nine companies targeted by PETA cut
animal testing by 42 percent from 1986-88.
   Two of the companies _ Avon and Greyhound _ say they no longer
use animal testing for cosmetic and household product research, the
report said.
   Other companies highlighted in the study were American Home
Products, Bristol-Myers Products, Colgate-Palmolive, Gillette,
Johnson &amp; Johnson, Proctor &amp; Gamble and Schering-Plough, which
produces Maybelline cosmetics.

<HEAD>Doxycycline Recalled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal officials say more than 3,000 bottles
of an antibiotic distributed by Goldline Laboratories, doxycycline
hyclate, are being recalled because one bottle was found to contain
a muscle relaxant.
   Doxycycline hyclate is used to treat a wide range of infections,
including venereal diseases, acne and life-threatening pneumonia.
   The Food and Drug Administration said Thursday that the
mislabeled muscle relaxant, carisoprodol, could harm patients
because it would not treat their infections and could impair their
mental and physical abilities, making it dangerous to drive a car
or operate heavy machinery.
   The recalled bottles of Goldline doxycycline hyclate 100
milligrams are in six lots. The bottles carry lot numbers 824039,
844059, 863069, 882079, 883079 and 919099.
   The carisoprodol tablets are white and round with the Bolar
Pharmaceutical Co., Inc., logo on one side _ a ``b'' over an
inverted ``b'' _ and the number 0094 stamped on the other side.
   The FDA said patients who find that they have the mislabeled
product should stop using it, contact their physicians and return
the prescription to their pharmacy.

<HEAD>43-Year-Old Woman Having Baby to Save Dying Daughter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A couple whose 17-year-old daughter is dying
of leukemia is having a baby in hopes the infant will prove to be a
compatible bone marrow donor who can save their daughter's life.
   Abe and Mary Ayala of suburban Walnut undertook the desperate
gamble against the advice of their doctor, following a fruitless
nationwide search for a suitable donor, the Los Angeles Times
reported today.
   ``It made me uncomfortable,'' said Dr. Patricia Konrad, a
pediatric oncologist at City of Hope Medical Center in Duarte. ``It
didn't sit well, if that was the only reason, to have a child to
help another child.''
   The odds are about one in four that the baby _ a girl who will
be born in April _ will provide a compatible match, doctors say.
   ``I never thought I'd be pregnant at my age, but when you're
faced with the possibility that your child is going to die, you
desperately seek, and whatever you need to do, you do it,'' said
Mary Ayala, 43.
   Konrad, despite her misgivings, has agreed to perform the marrow
transplant if the baby turns out to have compatible tissue.
   Abe Ayala had undergone a vasectomy after their daughter,
Anissa, was born. Doctors offered little hope a reversal would
succeed, but Mrs. Ayala became pregnant six months after her
husband's operation.
   ``We're just waiting and hoping that our miracle baby will be
the miracle baby that Anissa needs,'' Mrs. Ayala said.
   Anissa's condition has stabilized, and doctors have told the
family that bone marrow can be obtained at little risk from an
infant who is at least six months old.
   If the tissue matches, Anissa will undergo a long and painful
process of preparing for transplant surgery. Her existing bone
marrow, which is being ravaged by the malignancy, would be
destroyed through bombardments of radiation and chemotherapy.
   Donor marrow is harvested by inserting a thick needle repeatedly
into the donor's hipbones. A healthy donor can regenerate lost
marrow within a week.
   Medical ethicists said it is extremely rare for a baby to be
conceived specifically to serve as a bone marrow donor for an
ailing family member.
   Medical procedures, such as donating marrow during transplant
surgery, require a patient's informed consent. With children, such
consent usually is given by the parents or legal guardian.
   The Ayala case, however, raises questions about the parents'
objectivity in deciding what is in the newborn's best interest.
   ``How much potential pain and risk can one parent demand of one
sibling for the benefit of another sibling?''asked Jake Priester, a
research fellow at the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the
University of Minnesota.
   The Ayalas voiced dismay that their motives might be questioned.
   ``If it's not a match, we will love our baby just the same,''
Mary Ayala said.
   The couple discussed the idea at length with Anissa and their
19-year-old son, Airon, and they sought guidance from God, Mrs.
Ayala said.
   ``I had a dream and God told me everything was going to be OK,''
she said. ``He wants me to have this baby.''

   Kidnappers seized a priest from New York
during a visit by President Bush, and a U.S. official said he was
the third American captured in a leftist guerrilla campaign to
protest the trip.
   The Roman Catholic priest was abducted as Bush met in the
coastal city of Cartagena with the leaders of Colombia, Peru and
Bolivia to coordinate their war on drugs.
   The Rev. Francisco Amico Ferrari, from Rochester, was on his way
to celebrate Mass Thursday at a church near his parish in a poor
neighborhood of Cali when he was intercepted by armed men, said the
Rev. Robert Seguin, of Detroit.
   No one claimed responsibility, but a State Department official
in Washington said the kidnappers had identified themselves as
members of the pro-Cuba National Liberation Army.
   Amico, 40, who has lived in Colombia since he founded a Cali
branch of the Toronto-based St. Basilian priests in 1987, was the
third American reported kidnapped by the guerrilla group this week.
   The group claimed responsibility for the bombing of two Mormon
temples earlier this week.
   The State Department official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said witnesses overheard the kidnappers say the priest
would be released.
   In a telephone interview, Seguin said he hoped Amico would be
freed when Bush leaves Colombia. Bush returned to Washington later
Thursday.
   On Tuesday, members of the guerrilla group kidnapped two
Americans _ David Kent and James Donnelly _ to protest Bush's visit
and said they would put their captives on trial, according to
police. Kent, 40, is a teacher from Indianapolis, while Donnelly is
a 65-year-old businessman from Detroit.
   On Wednesday, the White House denounced the kidnappings of Kent
and Donnelly. It said Bush would cooperate with Colombian officials
to help ``in any way deemed appropriate to help resolve this
situation.''
   Rebels sometimes provide military protection for cocaine
traffickers, who pay handsomely for the service.
   The RCN broadcast network said Amico is one of four priests
working in the neighborhood of Aguas Blancas, one of poorest in the
southwestern city. It quoted an unidentified parish priest saying
he was with nuns of Mother Teresa's order when he was abducted.
   The report said the priests are helped by four nuns from the
Missionaries of Charity, founded in India by the Nobel laureate.
   Cali, a city of 1 million people 450 miles south of Cartagena,
is home to the Cali cocaine cartel, a rival of the Medellin cartel.
The two are believed to manufacture 80 percent of the cocaine
imported to the United States.
   A longtime friend of Amico's in Rochester, the Rev. Ronald
Schwenzer, today was quoted as saying Amico told him in a recent
letter that he feared the violence in Cali would escalate.
   ``What he wrote about was the lack of respect for life. People
are killed on the streets for drugs. Human life is not considered
precious; it's kind of cheap,'' Schwenzer was quoted as saying in
the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle.
   ``They are aware that since this war on drugs began in the fall
_ that as Americans, there was a possibility that they could be
kidnapped, or shot and killed, or whatever.''

<HEAD>Pastor of Historic Church Charged with Bookmaking for Congregation</HEAD>

   A pastor, his assistant, the church secretary
and four other people were charged with running an illegal lottery
out of an historic city church.
   Police on Thursday raided the Ebenezer A.M.E. church and 13
homes allegedly used as substations for the bookmaking operation.
   The arrests were partly a result of wiretaps placed on the
pastor's phone after police were tipped off by members of the
congregation who were offended by what was going on, said Sgt.
George Klein of the vice unit.
   ``We were pretty skeptical about it at first,'' said Klein. ``We
thought no one in their right mind would run a lottery out of a
church.''
   The Rev. Wendall Christopher, 39, was charged with allowing the
church to be used for an illegal lottery, police said. Assistant
pastor Jerome Berry, 58, and his wife, Mary Berry, 49, were charged
with operating the lottery.
   Investigators said they believed Christopher might not have
directly participated in the operation, but allowed it to operate
from his study in exchange for a portion of the proceeds.
   Also detained were church secretary Julie Hall, 36; Rebecca
Griffin, 57; Phyllis Cooper, 28, and Larry Cooper, 42, police said.
   Ebenezer is believed to be the oldest continuously used black
church in the city. The site of the church was purchased by freed
slaves in 1839, and the present structure was built in the 1860s.
   Police were tipped off about the alleged lottery in May and in
October obtained a court order to tap the pastor's telephone, they
said.
   Three- and four-digit numbers were collected from players each
day at the substations and phoned to the church, police said. The
operation used the winning Maryland State Lottery numbers to
determine its winners.
   Police said they would not have an idea of the amount of money
involved in the operation until they look at seized lottery slips.

   A man nabbed napping on the couch in a
house he had just burglarized was sentenced to 20 years in prison,
authorities said.
   Keith Sinclair, 24, pleaded guilty Thursday to second-degree
burglary after police said he broke into a house, reclined on a
couch and took a snooze.
   Asked what Sinclair had stolen, prosecutor Howard Cole said,
``He never had a chance to. I guess he got tired and sat down, and
just fell asleep.''
   Sinclair broke the glass on the front window of Diane Royal's
home around midnight on Dec. 16, according to testimony in the
Guilford County court.
   Royal's daughter was startled on returning home that night to
find Sinclair _ clutching a pistol _ on the couch. She called
police, who woke the dozing Sinclair.
   Sinclair's attorney, John Bryson, said his client was
intoxicated when he broke into the house.
   ``My client was so grossly impaired that he had no recall of the
event,'' Bryson said.

<TEXT>
   A stone-throwing mob attacked the motorcade of
leading presidential contender Mario Vargas Llosa during a campaign
swing in a northern city. Police said the candidate was not injured.
   A foreign journalist accompanying the candidate was injured and
had to be taken to a hospital, said a statement by the Democratic
Front, Vargas Llosa's center-right coalition.
   The party blamed supporters of President Alan Garcia's Aprista
Party for the attack Thursday in the northern city of Trujillo, an
Aprista stronghold. It was the second attack on a presidential
candidate in eight days.
   The statement said ``an Aprista mob'' attacked the motorcade
with sticks and rocks, ``destroying all of them (the cars) except
the one in which the Vargas Llosa was riding.''
   Police Gen. Diomedes Diaz confirmed the afternoon attack but
said only one car was hit and no one was injured.
   The Democratic Front communique said Kevin Rafferty, a reporter
for International Media Partners group, was injured. It did not
give his nationality or further details on his injury.
   Trujillo is 350 miles northwest of Lima on the Pacific coast.
   Vargas Llosa, an acclaimed novelist, was making a campaign swing
through the area, and his motorcade was returning to Trujillo from
the town of Cartavio, 18 miles to the north, Diaz said.
   He said a group of people gathered in Campo Grande, a slum on
the northern edge of the city, threw rocks at the motorcade as it
passed. He said a car carrying journalists was hit by a rock,
breaking the rear window of the car.
   Diaz said it was not known if the group that attacked the
motorcade was composed of Aprista members.
   On Feb. 7, Marxist presidential candidate Henry Pease was
slightly wounded in the leg by birdshot fired by police who also
used tear gas to break up a campaign march in downtown Lima near
the presidential palace. Five others were injured.
   Interior Minister Agustin Mantilla offered his resignation
following the incident, but the government refused to accept it.
   Vargas Llosa, a severe critic of Garcia's government, is favored
to win the April 8 elections.
   Other candidates are Alfonso Barrantes of the Socialist Left
coalition and Luis Alva Castro of the center-left Aprista.
   By law, Garcia cannot run for re-election.

<HEAD>5,000 Teachers Rally at Statehouse, Storm Legislature</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 5,000 teachers skipped school to
attend a Statehouse rally where many of them kicked and pounced on
the doors of the House of Delegates chambers, chanting ``Let us
in.''
   State legislators were not amused by Thursday's demonstration.
   ``How could you teach a child discipline when you're doing
something like this?'' asked Del. Phyllis Given, a Democrat whose
complaints of intimidation by the teachers prompted state troopers
to patrol the chamber.
   ``As a former teacher, I respect their democratic right to come
and solicit support for salary increases, but I was appalled that
during the session they pounded, kicked the doors and yelled and
screamed,'' said Del. Marge Burke.
   The teachers, angered by Gov. Gaston Caperton's declaration
there is no money for pay raises next year, also picketed the
governor's mansion.
   West Virginia teachers earn an average of $21,904, ranking them
49th in the nation, according to the state teachers' assocation.
They received a 5 percent pay raise last month.

<HEAD>Australian Leader to Try for Record Fourth Term</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD BILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Bob Hawke today called a
general election for March 24 in a bid to gain a record fourth
consecutive term for his Labor government.
   Hawke said Australians ``faced clear and stark alternatives'' in
a vote over his government's economic record.
   ``We can as a nation make the choice to continue on the path of
steady growth, or under the Conservatives we can choose to forsake
the future in a traumatic rerun of the late 70s and early 80s,'' he
said, referring to years when the opposition was in power.
   ``The central question is whether we will continue forward
toward a fair society, an increasingly efficient Australian
economy,'' he said.
   Hawke spoke at a news conference after meeting with
Governor-General Bill Hayden to get approval for the election date.
   The timing of the election comes amid widespread dissatisfaction
with 17 percent interest rates, which have hurt home buyers and
small businesses. But the opposition coalition also has suffered
from internal squabbling and difficulty outlining alternative
policies.
   Hawke, 60, said he expected to lead the Labor Party to an
unprecedented fifth term before retiring.
   Andrew Peacock, the 51-year-old opposition coalition leader,
also predicted victory.
   ``It is good news for all Australians,'' he said of the election
date. ``This has been a government which has put average
Australians last. It has been a government for the very few and
privileged.''
   The Labor Party under Hawke was first elected in March 1983 and
won in early elections in 1984 and 1987. The deadline for calling
the next elections was May 12 with a three-year term of government.
   Hawke is considered one of the most popular leaders ever in
Australia, despite his tearful confessions about infidelity many
years ago, his daughter's former heroin addiction and his
acknowledgment that he once had a drinking problem.
   Recent opinion polls show support for the Labor Party at 45
percent, compared with 42 percent for the Conservative
Liberal-National Party coalition.
   Labor has 85 seats in the 148-seat House of Representatives,
which chooses the government. The Liberal Party has 45 seats, and
its coalition partner National Party has 18 seats.
   Hawke is hoping voters will remember the government's record of
creating jobs while lowering personal and corporate taxes. The
Labor Party has also deregulated the financial system and allowed
foreign banks to operate in Australia.

<HEAD>Unions: Daily News Has Out-of-Town Operations, Reporters Ready for
Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ALAN HARPER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Daily News' unions claim the newspaper has
set up an out-of-state electronic layout operation and recruited
reporters from sister newspapers as part of a contingency plan to
publish in the event of a strike next month.
   The News recruited reporters at two non-union Florida newspapers
owned by the News' parent, the Tribune Co. in Chicago, to work in
New York should there be a strike, said Barry Lipton, president of
Local 3 of The Newspaper Guild.
   ``I think they are trying to make honorable members of the
working press scabs. It's bad news,'' Lipton said Thursday.
``They're trying to provoke a confrontation, not just with the
Guild, with all the unions.''
   John T. Sloan, the News' vice president for human resources,
said: ``We are not going to detail our contingency plans. These
plans are in the best interests of our paper and our employees. We
are obliged to continue publishing regardless.''
   Sloan said, however, that management believes the disagreements
with the union ``will be fully resolved during the negotiations.''
   The contracts of the 10 unions expire March 30. The News says it
has to tighten work rules and eliminate overstaffing in order to
turn a profit after losses of $115 million from 1979 to 1989.
   The unions, under the umbrella of the Allied Printing Trades
Council, say the Tribune Co. is trying to break them. They call the
News' contract proposals insulting.
   The Guild on Thursday held its first round of talks with the
newspaper, which Lipton described as simply introductory.
   Lipton also said the law firm negotiating for the News,
Nashville, Tenn.-based King and Ballow, had told union negotiators
their pay would be docked for time spent away from their newspaper
jobs. That never happened before at the News, Lipton said.
   The News is setting up an electronic layout system in Newport
News, Va., where the Tribune Co. owns the Daily Press and the
Times-Herald, Lipton said.
   Several reporters and editors at two Florida-based Tribune Co.
newspapers, the Fort Lauderdale News-Sun-Sentinel and The Orlando
Sentinel, have been recruited to work at the Daily News should
there be a strike, Lipton said.
   Sources told New York Newsday that the reporters have been
promised their current salaries, a per diem payment, paid
transportation, lodging at hotels and protection by security guards.
   The Daily News, in a story in Thursday's editions, quoted
company sources who said that reporters and editors also had been
recruited at the Virginia newspaper.
   Management at the Fort Lauderdale paper threatened to fire
anyone who spoke publicly about the offer, the News quoted an
unidentified reporter as saying.
   Officials at the newspapers referred all calls to Sloan, who
declined to discuss the job offers.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Air Force colonel in charge of the Pacific
Stars and Stripes resigned today, saying the Pentagon ombudsman had
criticized him for managing the news published in the paper serving
U.S. troops overseas.
   ``I believe it was appropriate for the good of the organization
to tender my resignation,'' Col. Edwin J. Montgomery said.
   He said ombudsman Philip Foisie, whom the Defense Department
named last year, had said in a report that ``I inserted myself into
the newspaper's editorial process unnecessarily,'' especially in
the early part of his nearly four-year tenure.
   Montgomery declined to give more details on the ombudsman's
judgment, but said he was pleased that Foisie had not accused him
of censorship.
   ``I am disappointed that he saw my efforts to fulfill the
charter as management of the news,'' the Air Force officer said in
a telephone interview.
   ``The mission I had was to publish a newspaper that was unafraid
of news critical to its readers and their profession, but accurate,
in good taste, and which assured that both sides of contentious
issues were aired. I've done my level best to accomplish that.''
   Foisie's report was not made public, and when The Associated
Press reached him at U.S. Army headquarters in Heidelberg, West
Germany, he declined to comment on Montgomery's resignation.
   Foisie was visiting the European Stars and Stripes, the sister
paper of the Tokyo-based publication read by some 135,000 U.S.
troops in the Pacific region.
   Since his appointment, Foisie has visited both Stars and Stripes
papers to interview their military and civilian staff members to
assess the free flow of information to the papers' military
readership.
   Foisie is a former foreign editor of the Washington Post and
former executive editor of the Paris-based International Herald
Tribune.
   Civilian journalists at the Pacific Stars and Stripes have
complained of censorship by military editors, news management and
harassment of journalists who raise objections.
   One senior civilian journalist in Tokyo, Dewey Brackett, has
testified to Congress about his complaints, and believes he was
removed from the post of Pacific editor as a result.
   Montgomery, who has denied censoring the paper, is retiring from
the military later this year and his replacement has already been
named, Marine Col. Walter S. de Forest. He, like Montgomery, is to
hold the titles of commander and editor in chief of the paper,
though the ombudsman has recommended that a civilian be the editor
while the commanding military officer hold the title of publisher.
   Foisie said in an interim report that having a civilian be the
top news executive would make the paper less vulnerable to charges
that the military censors it.
   The Stars and Stripes papers are ``authorized but unofficial
publications,'' the Pentagon says. Their charter says they are to
provide ``a free flow of news and information ... without
censorship or news management.''

   An undercover detective who worked on
high-level drug trafficking cases was killed by a bomb planted in
his unmarked police car, authorities said.
   Dennis Wustenhoff, 41, died at Stony Brook University Medical
Center on Thursday after his car blew up in front of his home in in
this Long Island city, said hospital spokeswoman Maxine Simpson.
   ``This was probably an assassination and job-connected,'' said
Suffolk County Police Commissioner Daniel Guido. ``But we don't
know whether it was revenge or related to a current case Wustenhoff
was working on.''
   Wustenhoff, a 20-year veteran, was assigned to the narcotics
squad in 1984. He was involved in major ``high-level
narcotics-trafficking'' investigations, said Cecilia Clausing, a
Suffolk County police spokeswoman.
   The bomb blew out the entire front part of the late-model white
Cadillac, throwing debris up to 200 feet, Guido said. There were no
other injuries.
   The device was placed either in the engine or under the driver's
seat, Guido said. It was unclear if it exploded when the officer
turned on the ignition switch or whether it was set off when he sat
in the driver's seat.
   A neighbor who heard the explosion came running and helped pull
him out of the car.
   According to Guido, the officer was conscious and ``made some
comments to the rescuer'' when asked if he knew who might have done
it.
   Guido would not reveal what the comments were, but he said the
killing ``was not a street level operation, it was much higher than
that.''
   Wustenhoff was decorated 10 times by the department and had
worked with federal Drug Enforcement Administration agents on a
number of projects.
   The presiding officer of the Suffolk County Legislature, Donald
Blydenburgh, announced that a $1,000 reward is being offered for
information about the blast that leads to arrests.
   Wustenhoff leaves a wife and three children, a 14-year-old boy
and two girls aged 12 and 10. His wife and children were not in the
house at the time of the blast.

   A Soviet legislator visiting U.S. military
bases with members of the Supreme Soviet said his country was not
interested in keeping up with American military technology.
   Ten members of the Supreme Soviet's Defense and State Security
Committee toured the carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt at Norfolk
Naval Base on the invitation of their U.S. counterparts in the
House Armed Services Committee.
   ``Your Navy ... has produced a deep impression on us,''
committee Chairman Vladimir Lapygin said Thursday, speaking through
an interpreter.
   ``We do have a navy of our own, but we don't want our navy to
catch up with your navy because it is not so economical and this is
not our target,'' Lapygin said.
   The Soviets seemed impressed by the technology and manpower they
saw Thursday, and less enthusiastic about answering
security-related questions asked of them during a 15-minute news
conference on the ship's hangar deck.
   Asked about mutual European troop cuts announced Tuesday,
Lapygin said the delegation was in this country at the time and
hadn't discussed it.
   ``Our opinion is we have a deep respect for one another. There
is nothing to fear. We think you can keep as many troops as you
want,'' he said.
   The weeklong tour of U.S. military installations and scientific
facilities began Feb. 11 and was ending today. Rep. Les Aspin,
D-Wis., who led an American delegation on a tour of Soviet military
bases last August, was host to the Soviet delegation aboard the
Roosevelt.

<DATELINE>GONGJAK OBSERVATION POST, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Secretary of
Defense Dick Cheney peered through binoculars into heavily
fortified North Korea today and said the experience reminded him of
America's ``determination to protect freedom and democracy'' around
the world.
   ``At a time when we are welcoming changes in Eastern Europe and
the erosion of the Soviet position in the Warsaw Pact, it's
important to be reminded that the United States and the Republic of
(South) Korea still face a very hostile and threatening power in
the North,'' said Cheney.
   Cheney was driven up steep, muddy slopes by jeep to this
mountaintop South Korean army observation post along the 2.5
miles-wide Demilitarized Zone which separates the communist North
from capitalist South Korea.
   The border between the two Koreas is one of the most heavily
armed in the world, with some 1.5 million troops behind barbed wire
and bunkers on both sides.
   South Korean Lt. Col. Chang Gwang-il told Cheney in a strategic
briefing that Gongjak overlooked the Chorwon Valley, one of the
main invasion routes used by the communist North at the start of
the 1950-53 Korean War. A peace treaty has never been signed and
the two nations remain technically at war.
   Col. Chang told Cheney he was visiting the site on the birthday
of North Korea's Kim Jong Il, the son and heir apparent of ruler
Kim Il Sung, the world's longest ruling communist dictator.
   ``We never forget that we fought here side by side. ... We're
ready to fight!'' said the young South Korean colonel.
   Cheney was flown to the border outpost by helicopter after
lunching with troops of the U.S. 2nd Infantry Division, but had to
cancel a scheduled visit to Panmunjom, the truce village on the
border of the two Koreas, due to dense fog.
   During his visit to Camp Casey, headquarters of the U.S. 2nd
Infantry Division located 35 miles northeast of Seoul, he passed
dozens of tanks, bunkers and guard posts covered with camouflage,
buildings painted in speckled olive and brown and soldiers in
full-dress battle fatigues.
   Journalists were told Cheney asked to have an informal lunch
with 12 noncommissioned officers ``with no generals present.'' The
special fare for the day at Camp Casey's Warrior's Club, where
Cheney ate, was a ``Secretary of Defense Turkey Club Sandwich.''
   Cheney explained the background of cuts in troop strength and
defense spending to senior enlisted men and asked for their
comments, one witness said.
   There are 43,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea under a
mutual defense pact. U.S. officials said Thursday about 5,000 are
expected to be withdrawn in the next three years.
   The secretary told Seoul officials earlier that he wants to cut
U.S. forces in Asia and the Pacific by 10 to 12 percent _ at least
12,000 troops _ over the next three years.
   He said about 5,000 of the troops would be pulled out of South
Korea and another 7,000 to 9,400 would be withdrawn from the
Philippines and Japan. There are 120,000 U.S. troops based in the
three countries.
   Cheney, who also will travel to Manila and Tokyo, said the troop
cuts in South Korea would not be pushed ``precipitously.''
   ``Our commitment remains strong,'' Cheney told reporters
Thursday.
   At a meeting with South Korean President Roh Tae-woo Thursday,
Cheney reaffirmed Washington's firm security commitment to Seoul
and warned the military threat from communist North Korea ``remains
undiminished.''
   The Koreas, divided since 1945, face each other with more than
1.5 million troops deployed on both sides.
   On Thursday, North Korea charged that Cheney was in the region
to observe South Korean preparations for war against the North.
   In a radio broadcast monitored in Tokyo, North Korea also
demanded a halt to U.S.-South Korea ``Team Spirit'' military
exercises underway since last month, calling them ``nuclear war
preparations'' against the North.
   At a news conference at the end of talks Thursday, South Korean
Defense Minister Lee Sang-hoon said his government would give
``positive consideration'' to increasing its support for the U.S.
troops.
   An American official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Cheney wants Seoul to double its $300 million annual contribution
to the support of American forces.
   The official said many of the details will not be worked out
until the fall.
   South Korean estimates it provides nearly $2 billion annually to
U.S. forces, such as the rent-free use of land that is not counted
in the American calculation.

<HEAD>Daley Plans for Southeast Side Airport Gets Mixed Reaction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Richard M. Daley unveiled a $5 billion plan
for a third Chicago air terminal that would lower traffic and
delays at the world's busiest airport, O'Hare International.
   Daley announced Thursday that officials are planning a
9,400-acre airport, to be called Lake Calumet Airport, near Indiana
Harbor on the city's southeast side.
   Daley said the airport would cost $4.9 billion and generate
$13.7 billion annually for the impoverished industrial area, which
he called an ``ideal place'' for the long-discussed airport.
   Others weren't so sure.
   ``The only bright spot in an otherwise dismal proposal is the
recognition by the city of the need for a third major airport for
the region,'' said Rep. Henry Hyde, whose district encompasses
O'Hare.
   Federal transportation officials attribute national travel
delays to O'Hare's overcrowind problems. O'Hare is located
northwest of downtown Chicago, and Midway Airport is in the
southwest.
   ``The location proposed by Mayor Daley seems woefully inadequate
and the proposed completion date of 2010 means that Buck Rogers
will make one of the first landings at the new facility,'' said
Hyde, a Republican.
   He said building an airport there would displace 3,500 homes and
suggested the mayor go ``back to the drawing board.''
   U.S. Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner welcomed Daley's
announcement, and said the site he mentioned should be considered
along with others that have been suggested to the south of the city
and in northwest Indiana.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar turned weak late in the afternoon
session to close at the day's lowest level today, while the key
index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange slipped slightly.
   The dollar closed at 144.80 yen, up 0.10 yen from Thursday's
close of 144.45 yen. After opening at 144.80 yen, the currency
traded in a narrow range between 144.55 yen and 144.95 yen.
   Currency dealers said the exchange rate remained narrow prior to
the release of U.S. trade figures for December, due out in
Washington later today.
   ``There was some dollar-selling for position adjustment toward
the closing bell'' in anticipation of a holiday in the United
States next Monday, said Yuichi Tsuchiko, a dealer with Fuji Bank.
   U.S. currency and other financial markets will be closed Monday
for Presidents' Day.
   On the stock exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues lost 11.67 points, or 0.03 percent, closing the week at
37,460.32. The index gained 316.10 points Thursday.
   An estimated 500 million shares changed hands on the first
section, the same volume traded Thursday.
   Yozo Asai, a stock analyst with Yamaichi Securities Co., said
the Nikkei index gained 201 points at one point during the morning
session, but fell back on profit-selling in the afternoon.
   Despite Japanese media predictions that the governing Liberal
Democratic Party will maintain a majority in Sunday's lower house
elections, ``everyone is becoming weak over concern about what the
actual results from the elections will be,'' Asai said.
   He said investors also worried about speculation that the
nation's central bank will raise its official discount rate,
charged on its loans to commercial banks, soon after the election.
   The Bank of Japan raised its key lending rate three times last
year. The rate is currently 4.25 percent.
   At stake in Sunday's elections are 512 seats for the powerful
House of Representatives.

<TEXT>
   Britain and Argentina renewed diplomatic ties
severed nearly eight years ago over the Falklands War, but
Argentina said it would keep pressing its claim over the islands.
   Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd of Britain praised the accord
reached Thursday in Madrid, Spain after two days of talks.
   ``It underlines the fact that we have no quarrel with Argentina,
and this has been achieved without any sacrifice of sovereignty,''
he said on Britain's private Sky Television.
   Foreign Minister Domingo Cavallo of Argentina said Thursday's
accord ``means passing from a state of war to a state of peace.''
   In Buenos Aires, President Carlos Menem said the accord opened
up trade possibilities for Argentina, a major meat exporter. It
followed the resumption last month of direct air service between
the two nations, who traditionally were heavy trading partners.
   Menem also named Deputy Foreign Minister Mario Campora, nephew
of former president Hector Campora, as the ambassador to Britain.
   Menem, however, repeated Argentina's claim to sovereignty of the
South Atlantic islands 300 miles off his country's southeastern
coast. He said its claim was not diminished by restoring diplomatic
ties.
   The Falklands War broke out after Argentine forces invaded the
British-ruled islands on April 2, 1982. Britain sent a military
task force that recaptured them after a 74-day war.
   The fighting claimed the lives of 712 Argentines, 255 Britons
and three islanders.
   Britain began ruling the islands as a colony in 1833 after Spain
ceased to govern Argentina and abandoned the archipelago.
   Argentina claims it inherited the islands under the name Las
Malvinas from Spain and says Britain stole them.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has refused to discuss
Falklands sovereignty with Argentina. In turn, Argentina refused
until Thursday to declare the war officially over.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar applauded the
accord, saying it ``creates an atmosphere of confidence.''
   Talks between British and Argentine officials on resuming normal
relations began in August after Menem said Argentina would not use
them to raise its claim over the Falklands.
   A key to the Madrid agreement was Britain's agreement to lift
its 150-mile military protection zone around the islands. British
submarines, ships and planes have patrolled the zone.
   The islands are guarded by about 2,000 British troops.
   The British Foreign office said the two nations had agreed to
inform each other about movements of their warships and military
aircraft in key areas of the South Atlantic and give notice of
large military exercises.
   Under the arrangement, Argentine warships wishing to come within
50 miles of the islands and Argentine warplanes wishing to come
within 70 miles must give 48 hours warning.
   The Foreign Office said ambassadors will be exchanged ``in due
course.''
   Hurd said: ``It is for the Falkland Islanders to decide on their
own contacts with the mainland (Argentina).''
   Most of the 1,900 islanders are fiercely pro-British. Their
legislative council refused an invitation to join the Madrid talks.
   William Fullerton, governor of the islands, told British
television's Channel 4 News from Stanley, the capital: ``They
accept that there should be good relations between Britain and
Argentina.''
   He added, `The thing they would be worried about is the
sovereignty issue, and all along that has been specifically
excluded from the talks.''

   An explosion ripped through a
university lecture hall today, injuring 39 students, officials
said. It was the third explosion in 15 months at universities in
Brussels.
   ``It is probably a bomb attack, although we are still waiting
for final details,'' said a police official on condition of
anonymity. The two earlier explosions were bomb blasts.
   The blast occurred in an auditorium of the Univeristy of
Louvain's faculty of medicine as about 100 students attended a
pharmacy class. It was followed by a fire and dense smoke spread
through the hall almost immediately.
   Officials said 13 students were badly burned and 24 slightly
injured.
   Firefighters rushed in with gas masks to rescue the students.
   The police official said there were parallels with a bombing
Dec. 1 at Brussels University in which two students suffered burns.
A small bomb had gone off at the same university a year earlier.
   No one has claimed responsibility for these attacks.

<HEAD>Premier Gives Backing to VOA Station</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir gave his approval
to building a Voice of America transmitting station in Israel's
Negev Desert, despite protests from environmental advocates and air
force officers.
   The dispute over the U.S government-funded station has caused
strains between Israel and the Bush administration at a time of
delicate contacts between the two countries over complex Middle
East peace moves.
   The station expects to start broadcasting from Israel to Africa,
India, Afghanistan, Soviet Asia, and Eastern Europe in 1993, its
officials say.
   Environmental Affairs Minister Roni Milo of Shamir's right-wing
Likud bloc has argued against the new transmitter, saying it seems
unnecessary in light of recent changes in Eastern Europe.
   However, Malcolm Forbes Jr., chairman of the Board of
International Broadcasting, said Thursday the new station was
needed to further promote democracy.
   ``We agreed that in order to carry on the process of democracy,
we must continue to have the exchange and free flow of information
to all parts of the world,'' Forbes told reporters Thursday after a
20-minute meeting with Shamir. The board oversees the network.
   The planned station is seen in Washington as crucial to
transmitting VOA programs among millions in Asia and Africa, where
many governments have not undergone the recent liberalization in
Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
   ``We are moving ahead as decided two years ago. Shamir was very
supportive,'' Forbes added, referring to the agreement signed with
Israel in June 1987.
   Shamir's spokesman, Avi Pazner, said the premier told Forbes
that Israel would honor its agreement to allow the station.
   Israeli newspapers said the premier's consent follows a decision
by the four senior leaders of the coalition Cabinet, made up of
Likud and the center-left Labor Party.
   These top ministers stepped in after messages delivered through
U.S. Ambassador William Brown were quoted by reports as urging
``quick completion of the planning stages.''
   Work on the station has been delayed by lobbying from Israeli
nature groups that claim the three-square-mile complex and
200-meter tall antennae would emit radiation and disrupt wildlife,
including a bird migration route to Africa.
   Objections have also come from air force commander Maj. Gen.
Avihu Ben-Nun, who fears an important bomber training field may
have to be moved because the new station will interfere with its
operation, Israeli media reported.
   Communications Minister Gad Yaacobi of Labor has backed the
project, claiming it could bring up to $1 billion to Israel's
debt-ridden economy over the next 25 years and provide hundreds of
jobs.

<TEXT>
   Demonstrators left their homes to endure
freezing rain, hail and snow during a five-night sleep-out with the
homeless to promote affordable housing.
   ``The first night I slept out ... it was rather warm but last
night it began to snow a little after midnight and it was very,
very cold,'' Katie Wales, 22, a recent graduate of Brown
University, said Thursday.
   ``It was a very frightening experience being that cold,'' Wales
said.
   The camp-outs, which started Sunday and were set to end today,
attracted about 80 people at locations in Providence, Cranston and
Pawtucket _ nearly twice the original goal, organizer Jim Tull said.
   ``It was supposed to be only three at each spot, but people have
just been coming down and adding to the numbers, including some
homeless people,'' said Tull, 35, a co-director of Amos House, a
shelter and soup kitchen.
   ``We've had families. We had a woman with three of her children
last night and a gentleman with his daughter last night also.''
   The effort is part of a nationwide campaign that started Dec. 25
and is scheduled to continue in 65 communities until April 15, Tull
said. A similar vigil also was held in Washington, D.C., this week.
   Rhode Island's homeless population could be from 2,000 to 5,000,
said Tull. Nationally, it is estimated there are between 3 million
and 4 million homeless.
   The Rhode Island protesters faced sub-freezing temperatures
earlier in the week; Thursday night it was warmer but raining.
   ``When that starts banging on the box it keeps you awake. The
people who weren't in a box, they got soaking wet,'' said Ed, a
34-year-old homeless man, who said normally on a such a night he
would have taken refuge under a downtown bridge.
   Ed, who asked that his last name not be used, said he is in line
for a job and has been receiving counseling for his alcoholism.
   ``For me things are looking a lot better,'' he said. ``That's
what I'm here for _ I'm trying to help other people, too.''
   Participants said the public has been supportive, dropping off
coffee, donuts and soup. Some brought blankets.
   ``One person reached out with a $50 bill to give to us to go get
a hotel room,'' said Tull, who said the group declined.
   Ed, however, said it's not always like that. ``Some people put
you down,'' he said. ``They tell you to go out and find a job.''
   Tull said Rhode Island's congressmen, all of whom met with the
group this week, were ``moved by the extent to which we had made
our point.''
   He said, however, that the night before the group met with Sen.
John Chafee, a Republican, ``he crossed the street and walked
around us,'' then crossed back over.
   Chafee was unavailable for comment but Mike Ryan, an aide, said
Thursday, ``It certainly wouldn't have been intentional.''
   Dan Newman, 20, a Brown student, planned to head to classes at
the Ivy League university as usual today after his night on the
street.
   ``I like to think of it as, I am a citizen like everyone else
and because of the circumstance of how I was born I have an
opportunity to help out and to raise awareness,'' Newman said.

<HEAD>Soviet Property Bill Sent Back to Committee</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers today demanded changes in a landmark
bill legalizing private property after attacking the proposal as
overly narrow, vague, and open to abuses.
   A group of 100 deputies fearing quick changes in the Soviet
Union today announced formation of a parliamentary faction to
``resist the breakup of the U.S.S.R.'' Members of the new group
vowed to fight separatism, nationalism and chauvinism.
   In the second day of its winter session, the Supreme Soviet
parliament sent the bill to committee and said it would take up the
issue next week.
   The property bill stems from the Communist Party's decision last
week to diverge from orthodox Marxism and permit ``individual
property,'' including ``means of production.''
   But the 35-article bill never uses the words ``private
property'' outright. Instead, it speaks of ``the property of
citizens.''
   Deputy Vladimir Tikhonov, an agricultural scientist, said he is
concerned that it mentions the right to own property but does not
require the often recalcitrant Soviet bureaucracy to sell it.
   Other lawmakers, speaking on the second day of debate over the
proposal, argued the bill is not clear.
   ``Everything in the draft law has two meanings,'' said Anatoly
Sobchak, a prominent reform-minded deputy from Leningrad. He said
the law must specify that ``any form of property'' is legal.
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev's nearly five-year tenure as Soviet leader
has led to many upheavals in politics and society, but few official
proposals have the ideological sweep of the proposed Property Law.
   Citizens who were taught for generations that property is theft
are now being asked to accept private ownership along with two
other forms of property already in existence _ collective and state
ownership.
   ``The words `private property' cause an allergy in us all,''
said one lawmaker who spoke in support of the bill.
   For decades, Soviet orthodoxy has forbidden the private
ownership of farms, factories or equipment on a large scale,
viewing it as the root of economic exploitation.
   But the proposed law has the blanket legalization of the ``means
of production'' and says foreign firms, once scorned as agents of
imperialism or neo-colonialism, can own factories and buildings.
   The law is designed to spur the stagnating economy through
greater productivity and an inflow of Western capital.
   ``If we want to have a market economy and take part in the
international marketplace, then we need such a law,'' Justice
Minister Veniamin F. Yakovlev said in defense of the bill Thursday.
   The new parliamentary faction, ``Soyuz,'' Russian for union,
appears to be opposing Baltic representatives who want to restore
independence to their republics. It also seems to oppose the
Interregional Group, an organization of progressive radicals
demanding rapid, radical economic and political reform.
   The Interregional group includes leading reformer Boris N.
Yeltsin.
   The official Tass news agency, which announced formation of the
new faction, did not clarify if the faction was created by
lawmakers in the Supreme Soviet or in the separate Congress of
People's Deputies, a body created by Gorbachev. However, it called
the new faction a ``parliamentary'' group, suggesting it is part of
the congress.

   The party is over for the homeless
who once feasted on Cajun-style blackened fish, gourmet soups and
rich desserts _ all leftovers from Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s
Beverly Hills office.
   For two years, the homeless who gathered nightly at a nearby
park often dined at picnic tables piled with tenderloin beef,
chicken breasts, gourmet breads and New York-style cheesecakes left
from the company's lavish lunches. But the bulk of Drexel's Beverly
Hills staff faced layoffs today and the office was expected to
close.
   ``This will hurt because they were our major source of food and
we have no one to replace them,'' said Ted Landreth, a spokesman
for the Greater West Hollywood Food Coalition, which distributes
food to about 250 people in Plummer Park.
   ``The food from Drexel has been phenomenal, better than at most
deluxe restaurants _ expensive meats, thick soups of all different
varieties, lovely salads,'' Landreth said.
   In the company's heyday, the coalition sent a car every day to
pick up an estimated $500 worth of food, or about 40 percent of its
daily distribution, that had been passed over by busy financial
traders at the 400-employee office.
   Drexel had offered the food free to employees on the advice of
the company's junk-bond chief, Michael Milken, who since has been
fired and faces federal securities-fraud charges.
   ``It was Michael Milken's concept that everyone should be fed
well. Everyone from the traders to the maintenance people ate
well,'' said Neilson Cook, Drexel's food services director.
   ``He figured that if they were eating at their desks, they would
be less likely to eat out and give away company secrets, and he
also wanted to keep the amount of time spent away from work at a
minimum.''
   The investment bank's parent company, Drexel Burnham Lambert
Group Inc., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Tuesday and
immediately began liquidating billions of dollars in assets.

   The eldest son of Gov. Mario Cuomo plans to
marry a daughter of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, linking two of
the country's most influential liberal families.
   Ethel Kennedy on Thursday announced the engagement of her
daughter, Kerry, to Andrew Cuomo, and Gov. Cuomo said the whole
family was ``very, very pleased'' about the union.
   The two said they would marry sometime this spring or early
summer at Ethel Kennedy's home in McLean, Va.
   ``Kerry is a wonderful, wonderful young lady. We know her. We
love her and we couldn't be happier,'' the governor said.
   Noting Andrew's age, he said: ``For those of us who went into
marriage from puberty, 32 is kind of delaying it for quite some
time.''
   Andrew Cuomo, a lawyer, proposed to Ms. Kennedy on Valentine's
Day and presented her an emerald-cut diamond ring. They dated for
18 months.
   Both have followed in their fathers' footsteps of public service.
   Cuomo ran his father's two successful gubernatorial campaigns.
He also works full-time at the non-profit organization he founded
that provides temporary housing for homeless women and children.
   Ms. Kennedy, 30, directs the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Human
Rights in Boston, which supports political activists around the
world.
   Ms. Kennedy, the seventh of 11 children, was 8 years old when
her father was assassinated in 1968. She is a graduate of Brown
University and Boston College Law School.

   The second toxic chemical leak in two
weeks at a plant considered among the most modern in the nation
forced authorities to order 15,000 residents to remain indoors.
   About 500 gallons of muriatic acid leaked from a transfer hose
at Rhone-Poulenc's Institute plant Thursday. No injuries were
rported, but fears that poisonous vapor released in the spill would
spread over Institute and neighboring St. Albans led officials to
order people inside.
   ``I'm certainly concerned,'' said plant manager Ron Bearer.
``This is a serious incident when we have to recommend to emergency
services'' that people stay inside buildings.
   The vapor didn't leave the plant, and authorities lifted the
order 30 minutes later.
   In the first leak, on Feb. 2, a small amount of methyl
isocyanate, or MIC _ the same chemical that killed 3,500 people in
1984 at Bhopal, India _ escaped from a pipe and injured seven
workers.
   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration sent
inspectors to the plant after the small MIC leak. They were still
at the plant Thursday, and two more inspectors were dispatched to
look into the muriatic acid leak, said Jack Hord, a spokesman for
the U.S. Labor Department.
   After the Bhopal leak and a series of leaks here in 1985, OSHA
performed a wall-to-wall inspection of the plant, which then was
wholly owned by Union Carbide. The company was cited with 221
violations.
   A $1.37 million fine assessed by OSHA was settled out of court
for $408,500 on the condition Carbide didn't have to admit fault.
   The plant, which is about 10 miles west of Charleston and is now
owned by both Union Carbide and Rhone-Poulenc, a French company,
was considered by Carbide as the safest in the nation after the
company spent millions improving safety systems after the 1985
leaks.
   Hord said the recent incidents don't mean ``this is an unsafe
operation. It doesn't compare to what happened in 1985. The
problems at Institute in 1985 were just multiplying. You just have
two incidents here.''
   After an August 1985 leak at Institute, 135 sought medical help
at hospitals.
   The muriatic acid leaked as workers filled a tank at the plant's
wastewater and sewage treatment plant, where the chemical is used
as a neutralizing agent. A truck apparently ran over a hose,
causing it to split open, Bearer said.
   Muriatic acid is a mixture of hydrochloric acid and water.
   A condensed solution of hydrochloric acid causes severe burns
and permanent visual damage may occur, according to The Merck
Index, an encyclopedia of chemicals. If inhaled, it can cause
coughing, choking and inflammation and ulceration of the
respiratory tract.
   The U.S. Coast Guard stopped traffic on the Kanawha River for 30
minutes for fear the vapor cloud would sweep toward the river. The
cloud dissipated soon after it formed.
   After the Feb. 2 leak, the plant owners were criticized for
waiting three days to notify county emergency officials. Bearer
changed plant policy to require the reporting of all leaks.
   Community leaders praised the company for its fast reporting
Thursday. Kanawha County Manager Ron Gregory said county emergency
officials received word within 30 seconds of the leak's discovery.
   ``I believe the recent MIC incident may very well have had a
beneficial effect,'' Gregory said. ``It identified the
communications problem we had. That's now been corrected.''

   Gen. Michel Aoun's gunners today battered
a rival Christian militia with unrelenting artillery fire today
after mounting a tank-backed offensive the day before that left 20
people dead and 54 wounded.
   The militiamen answered with a barrage of rockets in the latest
clash in the 17-day duel for control of Lebanon's Christian enclave.
   Police said Thursday's casualties were the result of a 16-hour
offensive by 36 tanks and about 900 soldiers of Christian Gen.
Michel Aoun. They seized a chain of buildings around the district
of Ein Rummaneh, a stronghold of Samir Geagea's Lebanese Forces
militia.
   The power struggle has killed 554 people and wounded 1,829,
including the latest casualties, since it began 17 days ago,
according to police.
   Geagea's command said Aoun's gunners today were ``pouring their
criminal howitzer shelling'' on Ein Rummaneh and the militia's two
other East Beirut strongholds of Ashrafiyeh and Nabaa.
   The communique said Aoun's gunners were using U.S.-made 155mm
howitzers, firing ``incendiary shells that started several fires on
civilian property.''
   Aoun's command said Geagea's gunners were hammering
Aoun-controlled districts in east Beirut with multi-barreled rocket
launchers.
   Police said Aoun's gunners and Geagea's forces also were
exchanging intermittent shellfire in Kesrouan province, the
Lebanese Forces' main power base north of the capital.
   Geagea told the Christian Voice of Lebanon radio that the
fighting will ``last for as long as the general lives.''
   Aoun's command, in its communique, said Ein Rummaneh has
``militarily fallen, adding ``our forces will be able to overrun it
in a matter of hours.''
   A mediation committee of independent Christian figures pleaded
with the combatants to stop shelling hospitals. It said the
French-administered Hotel Dieu, an important hospital, suffered
``severe damage.''
   The committee's statement said the hospital administration was
``seriously considering the possibility of evacuating it ... if it
was targeted by shelling again.''
   The Syrian-allied government of President Elias Hrawi, based in
Moslem west Beirut, called upon the estimated 1 million Christians
living in the enclave to denounce both sides.
   Hrawi was quoted by the An-Nahar newspaper as telling a
government meeting Thursday that ``intensified efforts are under
way to put an end to the clashes.'' It gave no further details.
   Hrawi, a Maronite Catholic like Aoun and Geagea, was elected
Nov. 24 under a peace plan brokered by the Arab League. The plan
was designed to end the country's nearly 15-year-old civil war and
provide more power to the nation's Moslems.
   Aoun has rejected the peace pact and the government of Hrawi,
who has fired him as army commander. Aoun has criticized the plan
for not laying out a timetable for a complete withdrawal of Syrian
forces.
   About 40,000 of them control most of Lebanon. They came under a
1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate, but Aoun says they have been
backing the Moslems in the war.
   Geagea has recognized Hrawi, but he has been vague on the peace
agreement.

   The first settlement between a soft drink
company and a family that lost a child in a school bus accident
will bring the parents at least $2.7 million over 35 years, and
possibly more, a lawyer said.
   Raul and Margarita Ortega reached the out-of-court settlement
Monday with Valley Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Inc., the Ortegas'
attorney, Kenneth W. Sparks of Houston, said Thursday.
   The Ortegas' son, Jose Luis, died on Sept. 21 when a Valley
Coca-Cola truck collided with a school bus near the Mexican border,
killing 21 students and injuring 60 others.
   Sparks also is seeking damages for two other family members
injured in the accident: Jose Luis' brother, Raul E. Ortega Jr.,
17; and a cousin, Marisela Ortega, 15.
   In the settlement, the company agreed to pay $1.5 million to the
Ortegas. But an interest-earning annuity in the agreement will give
the family more than $2.7 million over 35 years, and more if the
parents live longer.
   The Ortegas were paid an undisclosed sum on Monday and will
receive lifelong monthly payments that begin at $4,000, and
increase to $7,000, Sparks said. His law firm received about
one-third of the settlement total.
   If the parents die within less than 35 years, the monthly
payments go to their heirs, he said.
   Sparks said the Ortegas did not want to comment on the
settlement, but said, ``My clients have assured me that they would
gladly refund all money in this settlement to obtain their son
back.''
   Valley Coca-Cola, based in the border town of McAllen, is a
defendant in lawsuits filed by nearly 50 other familes in
connection with the incident.
   Valley Coca-Cola wants the bus manufacturer, Blue Bird Body Co.
of Fort Valley, Ga., to share the liability in any lawsuit
verdicts. Valley Coca-Cola filed a lawsuit last month against Blue
Bird, alleging the bus was unsafe.
   The truck driver, Ruben Perez, 25, faces trial on 21 felony
counts of involuntary manslaughter.

<HEAD>Airline Chairman Resigns; Accepts `Moral Responsibility' For Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of Indian Airlines resigned
today, saying he accepted ``moral responsibility'' for a plane
crash in southern India that killed 91 people.
   Prime Minister V.P. Singh accepted the resignation of R.K.
Prasad and asked the joint secretary of the Civil Aviation
Ministry, P.C. Sen, to become managing director of the
government-owned domestic carrier.
   Prasad joined Indian Airlines in 1956 and took over as chairman
and managing director in April.
   The airline has been dogged for years by complaints of frequent
schedule delays and allegations of mismanagement, poor staff
morale, inadequate supervision and training of pilots, and poor
maintenance of planes.
   The government declined to release details of Prasad's
resignation, except to say he had accepted ``moral responsiblity''
for the crash.
   A 3-month-old Indian Airlines Airbus 320 crashed Wednesday about
50 yards short of a runway in Bangalore. The airline said 146
people were on the hourlong flight from Bombay and that 55 survived.
   At least 36 foreigners were on the flight, including American,
Japanese, West German, British, Sudanese, Somalian and French
nationals, officials said.
   A U.S. Embassy official in New Delhi said one American died, one
was missing and five had survived. The official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said today that their identities would not
be released.
   The government has ordered an investigation into the cause of
the crash. The weather was clear, and there were no signs of an
emergency, officials said.
   Aviation Minister Arif Mohammed Khan said the plane's ``black
box,'' the digital flight data recorder that logs all changes in
altitude, speed and direction, would be sent abroad for analysis.
He refused to say where it would be sent.
   The twin-engine plane is manufactured by Airbus Industrie, a
European consortium based in France. Airbus sent a team of experts
to Bangalore to help in the investigation.
   Wednesday's crash is the second accident involving an Airbus 320
and the first of an Airbus 320 in commercial service.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki told the
East German leader today that Poland must have at least a limited
role in talks to reunify the Germanys, the Polish news agency said.
   Mazowiecki, meeting with East German Prime Minister Hans Modrow,
reiterated Polish concerns that a united Germany may seek to
reclaim land ceded to Poland after World War II.
   Modrow was welcomed today at Warsaw's Okecie Airport by
Mazowiecki, with whom he had two meetings scheduled on political
and economic issues.
   East and West Germany and the four World War II allies that
divided them _ the United States, Soviet Union, Britain and France
_ plan a series of talks on eventual reunification.
   Mazowiecki described his first session with Modrow as
``fruitful,'' the official PAP news agency reported.
   ``Both speakers in an open way expressed their views on the
subject of the process which in the last few months has been
developing and is leading to the reunification of Germany,''
Mazowiecki told PAP.
   This process has to take into consideration the ``full security
of the rights of German neighbors,'' Mazowiecki said.
   ``Poland doesn't have to take part in everything, but it has to
take part in everything that concerns Poland, it has to be
present,'' he added, according to the PAP report.
   Sessions were also planned with President Wojciech Jaruzelski,
and Modrow was to address the foreign affairs committees of the two
houses of parliament.
   ``Hans Modrow will have a chance to join our postulate and
voices of those states which think that Poland must be included in
the unification talks,'' the government daily Rzeczpospolita wrote
today.
   Modrow has said he accepts Poland's western border as permanent.
East German government spokesman Wolfgang Meyer has attacked West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl for failing to assure Poland there
would be no effort by a united Germany to reclaim former German
territory forfeited after World War II.
   However, Modrow is likely not to be much of a factor in the
talks. His Communist-led government, which took over when the
former Stalinist dictatorship was overthrown last year, is expected
to be ousted when East Germans hold their first free elections on
March 18.
   West Germany has also said it has no territorial claims on
Poland, but Kohl has said he cannot speak on the subject for a
reunified Germany.
   West Germany foreign minister, Hans Dietrich-Genscher, on
Thursday rejected Polish participation in the talks, saying no
Polish territories would be included in the reunited Germany.
   But with no unequivocal statement renouncing future claims, such
reassurances are unconvincing to Poles, subject to past German
aggression and wary of German conservatives who contend Germany
still in theory exists within its 1937 borders.
   The Polish border along the Oder and Neisse rivers incorporates
40,000 square miles of territory ceded by Germany following World
War II, to compensate for an even larger territory taken from
Poland in the east by the Soviet Union.
   Jaruzelski on Thursday called the border issue ``a question of
life or death for Poland.''
   More than 46 percent of the 1,803 Poles surveyed Thursday in 50
towns nationwide by the Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper said they felt
``fear'' at the potential reunification of Germany.
   Only 7 percent said they greeted the prospect with ``joy,'' and
22.6 percent said they had mixed feelings, according to the poll
published today. The rest said they were indifferent, held another
opinion or no opinion.

<TEXT>
   Imelda Marcos cannot view classified government
documents to prepare for her federal racketeering trial next month,
a judge has ruled.
   U.S. District Judge John Keenan, in a written decision Thursday,
said lawyers for the widow of deposed Philippine leader Ferdinand
Marcos had not proven that the U.S. government had assembled an
interagency task force to investigate her and her husband.
   ``To say that `it is clear' there was, is advocacy run amuck,''
Keenan said in denying her request for classified documents from
more than a dozen government agencies.
   These included the departments of Justice, Defense and Treasury;
the offices of the president and vice president; the CIA, FBI,
National Security Agency, the Navy and the U.S. Embassy in Manila.
   The judge also scoffed at claims by her lawyers that Mrs. Marcos
and her husband were kidnapped from the Philippines by American
military forces after Marcos' ouster in February 1986.
   Keenan cited a June 1988 letter from Marcos to President Reagan
in which he thanked Reagan for his hospitality of two years ago and
wrote how he came to the United States ``at your invitation.''
   ``This is hardly the language of a kidnap victim,'' Keenan said.
The judge has yet to rule on a separate motion by Mrs. Marcos that
claims the U.S. government has no jurisdiction to prosecute her
because she was brought to this country against her will.
   Mrs. Marcos, who lives in Hawaii, is scheduled to go to trial
March 13 on charges that she and her husband embezzled more than
$100 million from the Philippine treasury to buy art and Manhattan
real estate. They also were charged with defrauding banks of $165
million in loans.
   Marcos died in exile in Hawaii on Sept. 28 at age 72.
   Prosecutors opposed the request for the classified documents,
calling it a fishing expedition.
   Keenan noted that the prosecution had already turned over to
Mrs. Marcos' lawyers about 350,000 documents, videotapes and other
items seized in its investigation.

<TEXT>
   A 68-year-old woman who shoplifted four packs of
cigarettes said a comment by Judge Wapner led her to commit the
crime.
   The woman admitted she stole the cigarettes and said she got the
idea from an interview that late-night talk show host Pat Sajak had
with Joseph Wapner, said Larry Ankrum, police spokesman at
Mountlake Terrace, a suburb north of Seattle.
   Wapner, a retired judge, presides over the syndicated television
show ``The People's Court.''
   Ankrum said the woman quoted Wapner as having said in the
interview that ``everybody steals, at least once in their life.''
The woman told police she pondered Wapner's comment for a while and
then decided to steal the cigarettes from a store Tuesday ``for the
thrill of it,'' Ankrum said.
   The woman was cited for shoplifting and ordered not to return to
the store, he said.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An international group screening the sale of
sensitive technology has granted preferential treatment to Eastern
Europe, recognizing it no longer presents a serious strategic
threat, a U.S. official said today.
   However, the United States blocked moves by the majority of the
group to grant the same preferred status to the Soviet Union.
   ``The strategic threat is changing, and COCOM must adapt,'' said
a U.S. delegate to the special two-day executive meeting of the
Coordination Committee for Multilateral Export Control. The Paris
session ended late Thursday.
   But another official close to the talks, also speaking on
condition of anonymity, said: ``I don't think the Americans
conceded anything. Their position is thoroughly old fashioned,
based on the Cold War perception of the Soviet Union as a country
with missiles aimed at America's heartland. There is no recognition
of the changes, no sympathy for the problems there.''
   Decisions are reached by consensus among COCOM members, which
include Japan, Australia and all 16 NATO countries except Iceland.
The group, formed about 40 years ago, screens technology exports to
prevent sensitive items from being diverted to military uses by
Communist governments.
   But their work has become far more complex with the rapid moves
toward democracy by the Soviet Union and countries such as
Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland, the three nations which stand
to benefit immediately by the new preferred status, which means
their applications will be more favorably viewed.
   COCOM said an intensified review would begin immediately aimed
at loosening the list of controlled high-tech goods in the areas of
telecommunications, machine tools and computers, ``the areas most
meaningful to the development of the East,'' the U.S. official said.
   For a country on the prohibited list to buy certain sensitive
items, it must be granted an exception by COCOM. The three areas to
be liberalized represent more than half of all the exceptions
granted, the official said.
   The official said COCOM had received ``overtures'' from
Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland, who promised to protect Western
technology if allowed to purchase the sensitive items.
   Even with the change of status, however, Eastern Europe will not
have the status enjoyed by China.
   ``There's still the question of diversion to Soviet military
use. That's not a problem with China,'' the U.S. official said.

<HEAD>Industrial Production Slipped 1.2 Percent in January</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Industrial production slipped 1.2 percent in
January, the government said today, as abnormally warm weather
reduced utility use and automakers temporarily laid off workers to
reduce bloated inventories.
   The Federal Reserve said January's decline followed a revised
0.2 percent gain in output a month earlier as a major strike ended
at the Boeing Co. and utilities fired up their operations to meet
the demand prompted by the fourth coldest December on record.
December's increase originally was reported to be 0.4 percent.
   It was the first dip in production since a 0.3 drop last October.
   ``In January, the output of motor vehicles was curtailed
drastically and the extremely warm weather caused a sharp drop in
utilities output,'' the department said.
   Output at utilities fell 10.7 percent last month, the warmest
January in 96 years of government weather record-keeping, reversing
a huge 6.3 percent advance in December.
   And the layoffs at auto factories drove overall manufacturing
production down 0.9 percent. Manufacturing output represents 84
percent of the index.
   ``Automobile assemblies plunged to a 4.1 million unit annual
rate from a 6.2 million unit rate in December,'' the department
said.
   The interest-sensitive manufacturing sector has been among the
hardest hit by Federal Reserve efforts to restrain inflation by
keeping a tight grip on credit.
   Production of durable goods _ big-ticket items expected to last
more than three years _ fell 1.7 percent after rising 0.3 percent
in December and 0.4 percent in November.
   Non-durable goods production increased 0.2 percent, reversing a
0.2 percent decline in December. It rose 0.2 percent a month
earlier.
   Output at mines, aided by the warmer weather, rose 2.1 percent
after a 2.0 percent decline in December and a 0.2 percent gain in
November.
   The changes meant the industrial production index in January
stood at 140.9 percent of its 1977 base, down from 142.5 percent a
month earlier.
   In another report, the Fed said the operating rate of the
nation's factories, mines and utilities dipped 1.2 percentage point
to 81.9 percent in January.
   Factory use had remained steady at a revised 83.1 percent in
December, largely because of the weather-related 5 percentage point
hike to 86.4 percent in the utility rate. It was the sharpest
utility-rate increase in the 23-year history of the government's
capacity utilization reports.
   The factory-use rate was 83.1 percent in both October and
November.
   But reflecting the warmer weather in January, the utility rate
plummeted to 77.1 percent. The department attributed the fall in
large part to a 10 percentage oint drop in power plant utilization.
   The operating rate measures not only output but also changes in
productivity levels.
   While it reflected sluggish output, the report could be
interpreted as good news for consumers. The closer U.S. industry
gets to full operating capacity, the greater difficulty it has
producing enough to meet demand, leading to shortages and
subsequent price increases.
   Analysts generally consider an operating rate of 85 percent or
above as an indication of inflationary pressures.
   The manufacturing-plant operating rate in January slipped to
81.9 percent from 82.9 percent in December. The rate had peaked at
84.7 percent in January 1989.
   The rate at factories producing durable goods fell from 80.9
percent to 79.4 percent.
   ``Operating rates for auto and truck assembly facilities dropped
to levels near their 1982 recession lows,'' the department said.
   The rate at factories producing non-durable goods fell 0.1
percentage point to 85.6 percent. The operating rate at mines was
down 0.8 percentage point to 884.7 percent.

   Chlorine gas seeped from a small paint
factory early today, killing four people, and injuring about 90
others living in a nearby shantytown, police said.
   The dead included a 3-year-old girl, her 8-year-old brother and
their 35-year-old father, and a worker at the factory, located in
one of the city's most densely populated and poorest neighborhoods,
police said.
   At least 20 of the injured were hospitalized, many in serious
condition, said police officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   According to police, the gas leaked from a cylinder that was
later plugged and removed from the factory. An arrest warrant was
issued for the factory owner, they said.
   Prasanta Sur, the health minister of West Bengal state, ordered
an investigation into the accident.
   About 3,600 people were killed and 20,000 injured when poisonous
methyl isocynate gas leaked on Dec. 3, 1984 from a pesticide plant
in the central Indian town of Bhopal. The factory was run by the
Indian subsidiary of the U.S.-based Union Carbide Corp.

<HEAD>UMW Wins on Health, Pension Benefits in Proposed Contract</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DUFFIELD, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Mine Workers strikers won
concessions on health care and pension benefits and Pittston Coal
Group got the ability to run its mines almost nonstop in a proposed
settlement distributed to miners today.
   If approved by the UMW's rank-and-file in Virginia, West
Virginia and Kentucky, the settlement could resolve the union's
bitter and sporadically violent 10{-month strike against the
nation's largest coal exporter by next week.
   The Associated Press obtained a copy of the proposed contract
from a source who insisted on anonymity. Since Pittston and the
union negotiators reached agreement on New Year's Eve, they have
kept contract details secret while both sides moved to dismiss
lawsuits and fines stemming from the strike.
   UMW President Richard Trumka announced Thursday that union
members would vote on the pact Monday, despite $64 million in fines
pending in a Virginia state court for illegal strike activity.
   More than 2,000 union members packed into a building at the
Russell County Fairgrounds this morning to receive copies of the
49-page contract, listen to pep talks by the union's top officers
and receive a briefing on the terms.
   Trumka choked back tears as he congratulated the miners on what
he said was a successful strike.
   ``I'm proud. I'm proud you did this,'' Trumka said as he raised
the contract in the air to a round of applause.
   Some miners grumbled about terms in the contract but most gave
it a favorable review.
   ``There's some good, some bad,'' said Jack Hale, a 48-year-old
laid-off miner. ``We'll just have to weigh the good against the
bad.''
   The proposal in many respects mirrors health and pension
benefits contained in the 1988 Bituminous Coal Operators
Association contract, the industry's national labor contract.
   But it differs in two significant respects: Pittston won the
ability to hire contract truck drivers and maintenance workers, as
long as union miners are not laid off in the process. And the
company would be able to run its mines around-the-clock and
seven-days-a-week, except for Christmas and the Sunday day shift.
   Wages were not a major issue in the strike. But miners would
receive a cumulative $1.20-an-hour raise at the end of three years.
Top-scale hourly pay in selected positions would be $17.52.
   Pittston dropped out of the health-care plan negotiated between
the union and the BCOA and spurred the strike by proposing payment
of 80 percent of the covered medical expenses rather than 100
percent.
   The UMW won its demand to maintain 100 percent medical coverage
for employees, pensioners and their families.
   The contract has a new health-cost containment provision in
which Pittston issues $500 twice-a-year to each miner and pensioner
under the age of 65 to cover their deductibles.
   After it dropped out of the BCOA, Pittston stopped contributing
to the multi-employer retirement fund and promised to take care of
its own retirees. It now has agreed to go back to the union pension
fund.
   ``Pension benefits in the new contract are identical to those
contained in the 1988 national agreement,'' according to a contract
summary.
   The company wanted to be able to contract out work in five job
categories but won the limited right in two areas: transportation
of coal and repair and maintenance work.
   The company wanted to eliminate a provision that union contracts
are not broken when a union mine changes hands or is conveyed from
one subsidiary to another.
   But the settlement retains the successorship provision in the
1984 agreement and contains ``strengthened protection for UMWA
members against internal company reorganization and shifting of
coal lands,'' the contract said.
   Pittston's significant victory was its request to establish
round-the-clock operations.
   During negotiations, the company dropped its original demand for
a Sunday day shift, with four 10-hour shifts a week instead of five
eight-hour shifts and the ability to call in workers for
``reasonable overtime'' with 12 hours notice, on a mandatory basis.
   The UMW wanted to stick with its traditional fixed five-day work
week.
   The contract contains two ``flextime'' work schedules in
addition to the regular work week. The flextime allows the company
to work continuously.
   Pittston did not want to reinstate miners convicted of
strike-related felonies. The UMW wanted all miners reinstated. A
mention of the issue could not be found in the labor agreement.

<HEAD>Body of Kenya's Missing Foreign Minister Found</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The partially burned body of Foreign
Minister Robert Ouko was found today near his western Kenya home,
three days after his mysterious disappearance.
   The government indicated he had been murdered.
   The discovery of Ouko's body was announced by President Daniel
arap Moi, who said it was found ``in circumstances which at the
moment suggest foul play.''
   The body of the 58-year-old minister was found in a sugar cane
field about four miles from his family farm in Koru, not far from
Lake Victoria.
   The president's statement said the body was partly burned and
pledged ``that anyone who may be associated with this horrible
event will most certainly be apprehended.''
   Ouko, considered one of the most skilled members of Moi's
Cabinet, dropped from sight Tuesday. His disappearance went
unreported until Thursday evening, when the offical Kenya News
Agency broadcast an appeal from family members urging him to
contact them or government officials.
   Moi said Ouko's death was a loss for ``the whole nation,''
calling him ``a brilliant leader, an articulate and courageous
spokesman of this country and a loyal servant of the people.''
   The minister appeared largely above the fray of Kenyan politics,
his name rarely appearing in almost daily press accounts of
rivalries within the country's single ruling party.
   Ouko was last seen publicly on Saturday, when he addressed a
service club in Kisumu, 220 miles northwest of Nairobi and not far
from his Koru home.
   State-run radio and television stations quoted unidentified
family members Thursday night as saying no one had seen him leave
his farm after he went to bed Monday night.
   The Kenya Times, a Nairobi daily newspaper, reported today that
a white car arrived at Ouko's home at about 3 a.m. Tuesday and left
with the minister. The paper attributed its report to two
unidentified household employees.
   Before the discovery of Ouko's body, a senior government
official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: ``People are
wondering how a full minister can disappear.'' He referred to the
fact that the homes of Cabinet ministers are always guarded by
armed policemen. They also use bodyguards when they travel.
   Ouko first served as permanent secretary in the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs in 1963-64. He then held a number of other
high-ranking government jobs before being tapped by Moi to head the
Foreign Ministry in 1979.

<HEAD>Kathleen Sullivan Bids Farewell To `CBS This Morning'</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with quotes from show, confirmation
that Zahn will succeed Sullivan.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Upbeat but appearing near tears, Kathleen
Sullivan said farewell today as co-anchor of ``CBS This Morning,''
telling viewers that she's proud of the show and jokingly asking
them not to forget her.
   Sullivan, who has been on the show with Harry Smith since it
began in November 1987, also confirmed in her farewell what CBS
spokesmen thus far have refused to comment on _ that ABC's Paula
Zahn will succeed her.
   ``Paula Zahn has been the stepmother to two of my other children
at ABC, and now I'm sure she'll take great care of my third, `CBS
This Morning,''' Sullivan said in her final day on the show, which
originated today from Disney World in Orlando, Fla.
   Before joining CBS, Sullivan co-anchored ABC's ``World News This
Morning'' and the news segments of ``Good Morning America.'' She
was succeeded on those programs by Zahn, who bid viewers of those
shows goodbye on Thursday.
   Their back-to-back farewell addresses came about after CBS News
executives decided to replace Sullivan, whose contract expires in
November. According to her agent, Ron Konecky, they gave no reason.
He said he is discussing other possibilities for her at the network.
   Zahn's agent has confirmed that his client is joining CBS News.
According to a source close to her contract talks, ABC officials
liked her work but decided against battling CBS' offer of a $1.1
million-a-year, four-year contract.
   Zahn, who had been earning $275,000 a year at ABC, could start
co-anchoring CBS' show as early as Feb. 26, according to another
source knowledgeable about negotiations for her switch to CBS.
   CBS has said that Faith Daniels, who co-anchors the ``CBS
Morning News'' that precedes ``CBS This Morning,'' will be the
latter program's temporary co-anchor next week.
   Sullivan, whom Smith today thanked ``for being such a great
friend and such a great teacher'' during her stay on the show, told
viewers that ``I'm very proud of what we've accomplished here in
the last 2{ years.
   ``We've restored the credibility that said we meant business in
the morning here at CBS.''
   That was an indirect reference her program's predecessor, ``The
Morning Show,'' a frothy, short-lived entertainment show that CBS
tried after years of generally failing to make a dent in the
ratings with a morning news program.
   Although there were cheers at CBS News when the division got the
morning time period back and put in ``CBS This Morning,'' the
program still is a distant third in ratings to the top-rated ``Good
Morning America'' and NBC's ``Today.''
   Sullivan, noting that eight of her 10 years on national
television have been spent on morning shows, told viewers that she
plans to take a break and that ``I'm hoping to do some really wild
and wonderful things.''
   She didn't elaborate, but added: ``So, if I show up on your
doorstep because I ran out of gas or my horse broke down, please
don't forget me.''
   Sullivan began her television career as an intern in 1977 at Los
Angeles station KNXT-TV, which is owned by CBS and now has the call
letters of KCBS-TV.
   Alluding to the Olympics telecasts she co-anchored while at ABC,
she wryly concluded her farewell by saying, ``Yeah, I'm the one who
wore the sweaters in the Olympics... I'm a bit older, but I'm also
a bit wiser.''

   The picture of a lone Chinese
demonstrator defiantly blocking a column of tanks during the June
crackdown of the popular uprising in Beijing won the 1990 World
Press Photo award today.
   The photo honored was made by Charlie Cole, a Newsweek magazine
staff photographer. The scene also was captured by other
photographers.
   ``The picture symbolizes the events of 1989 ... it's the
individual standing up to a repressive regime, to a military
juggernaut,'' said Michael Rand, art director of London's Sunday
Times Magazine and chairman of the nine-person World Press Photo
jury.
   Established in 1955, the World Press Photo award is one of the
most prestigious prizes in photo journalism. This year, 11,047
pictures were submitted by 1,280 photographers from 64 countries,
Rand said.
   In the spot news category, the second place was for a picture by
Agence France Press staffer Ron Haviv showing political opponents
of Panama's Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega being beaten by Noriega
henchmen.
   Eric Bouvet of the French agency Gamma won first prize in the
news features category. His entry shows hysterical Iranians
mourning the death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in June.
   Pictures of West Berliners tearing down the wall dividing their
city, taken by Anthony Suau of the American agency Black Star, won
first prize in the spot news series category.
   Norbert Rosing of West Germany's Silvestris Fotoservice won
first place in the humor category with his ``Seagull Attacks.''
Associated Press photographer Jim Mone won second prize with a
picture of former President Reagan exposing his partly shaved head
one week after he underwent skull surgery last year.

   Air quality officials say they hope
other companies will heed an agreement by Lockheed Aeronautical
Systems Co. to pay a $1 million fine for inadequate smog control
record keeping.
   ``We hope this settlement sends a message to the regulated
community that the AQMD is determined to crack down on so-called
technical violations such as record keeping, because these
violations have a serious effect on our air pollution problem,''
said Diana Love, chief prosecutor for the South Coast Air Quality
Management District.
   The agency described the civil penalty announced Thursday as a
landmark air pollution settlement under which Lockheed promised to
use more sophisticated painting equipment to cut down on pollution.
   Most violations involved errors in records related to the use of
coatings and solvents, the Burbank-based aerospace manufacturer
said.
   Some of the coatings and solvents the company uses emit volatile
organic compounds that are key ingredients of smog. Lockheed is
allowed to use those materials under a plan in which the company
also uses coatings and solvents with lower-than-required emission
levels.
   ``Lockheed has assured the district that it wants to protect the
environment and is committed to complying with district rules,''
said Dale Daniels, Lockheed executive vice president.
   Lockheed said it will have a central dispensing station for its
coatings and solvents, to better monitor their use. The company
also agreed to outfit all its plants with the latest pollution
reducing equipment.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Radio Metropole said one of its
reporters was beaten by a high-ranking army officer and forced to
sit in human excrement after a quarrel with a drunken policeman.
   The privately owned station said Ertho Zamor was arrested by a
drunken traffic police sergeant Wednesday night during a wake for a
member of Zamor's family near Bon Repos, 10 miles north of
Port-au-Prince.
   Radio Metropole said the unidentified sergeant brought Zamor to
a Bon Repos army post, where Maj. Isidore Pongnon arrived shortly
afterward. The station said the two then slapped and beat Zamor
with rifle butts, forcing him to sit in human excrement.
   The report could not be independently confirmed.
   In an interview with Radio Metropole, Pongnon acknowledged he
was present during the incident but denied he beat Zamor, saying
Zamor attacked the sergeant at the army outpost. He said Zamor had
been arrested because he was pretending to be an army officer.
   Zamor, who said he was not charged, was released early Thursday
morning and was being treated in the capital for head injuries, the
station said.
   Pongnon is assistant director of the Port-au-Prince Prefecture.
   He formerly commanded Fort Dimanche, a dreaded military outpost
where thousands of political dissidents disappeared during the
29-year Duvalier family rule. It was closed last year.
   Opposition and human rights groups had demanded its closure
since dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to exile France in 1986
after a popular uprising.

<TEXT>
   Tadzhik Communist Party officials today rejected
offers by the republic's leaders to resign, and the legislature
formed a committee to investigate more than a dozen deaths in
ethnic rioting.
   Thousands of protesters Thursday defied a ban on demonstrations
to demand the resignations of leaders in their Soviet Asian
republic. On Wednesday, the party chief, premier and president
offered to resign, but said they could not quit until the party and
local parliament released them.
   The Tadzhik party Central Committee declined to accept the
offers and decided to keep the current leadership, said Anatoly
Larenok, a correspondent for the national newspaper Vozdushny
Transport, Russian for air transport.
   He had no details of today's action.
   Residents interviewed by telephone said the streets were quiet
today in Dushanbe, the capital of Tadzhikistan. Western reporters
have been barred from traveling to the region.
   The republic's Interior Ministry raised the death toll from 18
to 20 in the violence that began Saturday, Larenok said. An
Interior Ministry spokesman said 568 people were injured, of whom
178 are hospitalized. Forty-two were arrested.
   The Presidium of the Tadzhikistan Supreme Soviet formed a
special deputies commission to investigate the deaths, said Boris
K. Pugo, a non-voting member of the ruling Politburo visiting
Dushanbe.
   ``The situations during the aggravation of events were complex.
For example, there were many bullet wounds. But so far it's not
known who was shooting and from where,'' Pugo told the army
newspaper Red Star.
   Tadzhikistan, which borders China and Afghanistan about 1,600
miles southeast of Moscow, is the latest in a string of republics
torn by ethnic strife since Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power five
years ago and relaxed some controls. He has repeatedly warned that
the turmoil threatens his reform program, and has had to resort to
force to put down uprisings in several republics that killed
hundreds of people.
   The violence in Tadzhikistan began Saturday night after rumors
spread that ethnic Armenians fleeing persecution in Azerbaijan were
being moved into the Tadzhik republic, where housing is scarce.
Officials said only a few dozen refugees had arrived.
   On Monday, authorities declared a state of emergency, which bans
demonstrations and sets an overnight curfew.
   The official Tass news agency reported 5,000 troops and
policemen were enforcing the state of emergency. It also said more
troops poured into the city, including Red Army soldiers assigned
to protect government buildings and factories.
   On Thursday, about 8,000 protesters defied a ban on
demonstrations and gathered near Communist Party headquarters to
demand further resignations by the republic's leaders, Soviet media
reported.
   They also demanded better housing, more jobs and a ban on
selling pork, a forbidden food for the majority Moslem population,
Tass said. In addition, they want the withdrawal of troops and an
end to the curfew.
   ``We think that the current Tadzhik leadership is incapable of
resolving socio-economic problems,'' said Tadzhik government
planning chief Buri Karimov, chosen by the demonstrators to lead a
Provisional People's Committee uniting the leaders of unofficial
organizations and intellectuals.
   ``People must wait years for good housing, and unemployment,
especially among young people, is on the rise,'' Karimov said. Tass
said as many as 200,000 people in the area are jobless.

<HEAD>Wiesel to Gorbachev: Voice Concern over Anti-Semitism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel is calling
for Mikhail Gorbachev to personally condemn a growing number of
anti-Semitic incidents in the Soviet Union.
   Wiesel said at a news conference Thursday that during a visit to
Moscow last month all the Jews with whom he spoke ``agreed the
situation is becoming increasingly dangerous.'' In six visits to
the Soviet Union, he said, he had never seen Jews there ``living
and dwelling in such fear.''
   He said he was told of many cases in which Jews were publicly
beaten or insulted as police or soldiers looked on impassively.
   ``The time has come for (Gorbachev) personally to address the
issue,'' Wiesel said. ``It must come from him _ directly, clearly.''
   He said he supported the Soviet president's reforms and was
confident of his intentions.
   ``I'm convinced Gorbachev is not pleased with anti-Semitism in
the Soviet Union,'' he said. ``I'm convinced he would like it to
disappear.''
   Soviet officials have warned that fanning racial hatred is a
crime punishable by imprisonment. But some Soviet Jews have
complained that not enough is being done to protect them from
attacks by right-wing groups that have flourished in the Soviet
Union as central authority has waned.

   Barbara Bush, taking care not to smile too
broadly, said today she feels great following outpatient surgery to
remove a small cancer on her lip.
   The first lady was chipper and upbeat at a downtown hotel today
as she toured an interior decorating exhibit that benefits one of
her favorite charities, the Washington Home, which operates
health-care and hospice programs.
   Asked how she felt, Mrs. Bush emphatically told reporters,
``Great.''
   Her lip was almost imperceptably swollen, with a row of subtle
stitches in place after removal of what she calls ``a small cancer
that you get because you were stupid and sat in the sun all your
life.''
   ``I've had a little operation ... So don't do anything funny, no
matter what. No laughing _ don't even look funny,'' she jokingly
told a group of pre-schoolers she visited at a New York day-care
center on Thursday. ``Don't make me laugh.''
   The outpatient operation to remove the small basal cell cancer
was performed Wednesday at the National Naval Medical Center in
suburban Bethesda, Md., and the first lady had local anesthesia.
Announcing the procedure on Thursday, her office called it ``a
routine outpatient medical procedure'' and said no side effects
were expected.
   The first lady visited All Children's House in Manhattan on
Thursday and returned to Washington before accompanying President
Bush today for a holiday weekend at their vacation home in
Kennebunkport, Maine.
   ``I feel wonderful,'' Mrs. Bush told reporters in New York.
``I'm great _ from here down and here up,'' she said, pointing
below and above the stitches above her lip.
   She said she would not require further treatment.
   ``It was a small cancer that you get because you were stupid and
sat in the sun all your life. It is totally gone. And the doctor
tells me that it's ... the least serious of all.''
   The stitches run from the bottom of her right nostril down over
her lip, said her press secretary Anna Perez, adding the first lady
suffered barely noticeable swelling.
   ``It only hurts when she laughs,'' the spokeswoman said.
   Mrs. Bush, 64, has suffered for a year from Graves disease, an
immune system disorder that affected her thyroid and irritated her
eyes.
   The thyroid problem, causing overproduction of hormones, was
cured by a dose of radioactive liquid.
   However, her eye problems have persisted.
   She underwent a series of 10 radiation treatments, ending a
month ago, designed to reduce the swelling behind her eyes that
causes double vision, especially in the mornings, and bulging and
irritated eyes.
   Basal cell carcinomas are common skin cancers that occur most
often on the face or on other skin areas that have been exposed to
the sun. Light-skinned people are most susceptible.

   Donald Trump's lawyers deny that the billionaire
has agreed to give his estranged wife, Ivana, $100 million in
exchange for quickly settling their much-publicized divorce.
   ``There are no offers and there will be none,'' Trump lawyers
Jay Goldberg and Stanford Lotwin said in a statement. They said the
Trump prenuptial and postnuptial agreements were ``ironclad.''
   The last written agreement calls for Ivana to receive $25
million, custody of the couple's three children and the couple's
mansion in Connecticut.
   But she wants more.
   And according to reports in New York's tabloid newspapers, which
have avidly covered the Trump divorce, she'll probably get it.
   Liz Smith, gossip columnist for the Daily News, reported in
today's editions that Trump is negotiating to offer Ivana ``more
money than even the aforesaid $100 million.''
   New York Newsday had quoted Trump associates as saying Trump
planned to up the ante to $100 million.
   Mrs. Trump, who runs the Plaza Hotel and Trump Castle in
Atlantic City, N.J., has said she wants ``a fair and equitable
share'' of Trump's estimated $1.7 billion fortune.
   Trump, who has been unusually quiet lately, broke his silence in
an interview with New York Newsday, saying a divorce settlement
worth more than the $25 million in the written agreement was a
longshot.
   ``I don't rule anything out, but it's highly unlikely,'' said
Trump, who called his pre-nuptial agreement ``100 percent'' solid.
   Beefy security men hustled him in and out of the Plaza Hotel
Thursday for a news conference about the championship boxing match
between Thomas Hearns and Michael Olajide.
   Asked by a reporter if he planned to give Ivana more money,
Trump smiled politely and said: ``Have a good time.''
   Hearns' manager, Emanuel Steward couldn't resist a gentle jab at
Trump.
   ``I want to thank The Donald for getting the crowd out for us
today,'' he said. ``The Donald'' is Ivana's pet name for her
husband.
   Hearns, asked to predict the winner in the Trump vs. Trump
fight, made a sure bet: ``A Trump is gonna win somewhere.''
   Trump, 43, walked out on his wife Sunday after nearly 13 years
of marriage amid reports he was involved with 26-year-old
actress-model Marla Maples, whom a source said he met at the church
where the Trumps were wed.
   Ms. Maples has not commented on the Trump split, but her agent,
Chuck Jones, denies she's involved.
   Try telling that to the New York Post, which today ran this
headline across its front page: ``Marla boasts to her pals about
Donald: `Best sex I've ever had.'''
   The Post said Maples once told an unidentified actress who
studied with her from 1987 to last spring at the Actors in
Advertising school in Manhattan that Trump was a ``wonderful,
wonderful lover.''
   The Post also said that Trump told Maples' parents he would
``take care'' of their daughter.
   Meanwhile, the News set up a Trump Phone Poll so readers could
register their support for either Trump. Results were to appear
Sunday.

<HEAD>Suspected Informer Axed to Death In Front Of 250 Villagers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six Palestinians dragged an alleged Arab
informer into the square of a West Bank village and axed him to
death in front of about 250 spectators, Arab reporters said today.
   Villagers chanted ``Kill him! Kill him!'' after the man
confessed through mosque loudspeakers that he had informed on
fellow Palestinians since 1968 and once led three PLO men into an
army ambush, the reporters said.
   The body of Mohammed Khatatbeh, 52, was found today in the
village square in Beit Furik near the West Bank city of Nablus,
Arab reporters said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The incident began Tuesday when six gunmen in camouflage
uniforms kidnapped Khatatbeh from his Beit Furik home. A day later,
they took him to the village mosque where he confessed to being an
informer, the report said.
   Late Thursday, Khatatbeh's captors hacked him with axes and
knives in the Beit Furik square as villagers looked on. The army
confirmed that a body was found and said police were investigating
the case.
   The public slaying of Khatatbeh was rare since alleged
collaborators usually are slain without witnesses, with their
bodies later left in public places to warn would-be collaborators.
   Khatatbeh's death brought to 185 the number of Palestinians
slain by fellow Arabs during the 26-month-old uprising against
Israeli rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Some 656 Palestinians
have been killed by Israeli soldiers and civilians, and 43 Israelis
also have died in the violence.
   Also today, the army defended itself against Palestinian
accusations that soldiers seeking a suspected activist fired wildly
into his home, killing a teen-age girl, and that border police beat
more than 40 high school students who were in custody.
   An army official said preliminary findings showed that in the
first case a soldier shot the girl to death on Dec. 22 after she
stabbed his hand as he broke a window and tried to enter her house.
The official was unable to say if other relatives were wounded.
   In the other case, the army said it stood by its report that the
40 students in Bethlehem were all hurt falling from a wall as they
fled paramilitary border police after a stone-throwing attack.
   The army response came after the Jerusalem Post quoted school
officials as saying the students were being held in a schoolyard
and Palestinian doctors as saying the students' injuries appeared
to be from beatings, not from falls.
   One doctor told the newspaper that not one student suffered a
sprained ankle, the most common injury in falls.

<HEAD>Slain Judge Heard Appeal from Man Investigated in Bombings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man targeted in the probe of a series of mail
bombs across the Southeast twice appealed a case to the court on
which a slain judge sat, a court official said today.
   Judge Robert S. Vance of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
was one of two victims of the bombs sent to targets in Georgia,
Alabama and Florida.
   Walter LeRoy Moody of Rex, one of three men investigated by the
FBI in connection with the mail bombs, was charged in 1983 with
attempted murder in Florida. Court documents show that Moody, using
the name Roy Moody, appealed in December 1988 the dismissal of a
lawsuit alleging malicious prosecution and false arrest in that
case.
   A panel of the 11th Circuit, including Vance, dismissed Moody's
appeal. A court official, who asked that his name not be used, said
the panel did not hold a hearing before dismissing the appeal and
Moody never appeared before the court.
   Moody again appealed the dismissal in August 1989. Court
documents show that Vance and two other circuit judges heard oral
arguments in Miami on Aug. 29, but the case is still pending.
   The court keeps no transcripts of oral arguments and has no way
of knowing whether Moody was present at the hearing, the court
official said. Moody's attorney, Grafton Carlson of Fort
Lauderdale, argued the case.
   Moody, 55, appealed over allegations made during the 1983 case
in which he was charged with abandoning in the Gulf of Mexico three
Georgia divers he had hired to photograph an underwater propulsion
device he planned to market. Jurors were deadlocked, and the judge
declared a mistrial. The state decided against retrying Moody.
   Vance was killed by a bomb sent to his Mountain Brook, Ala.,
home Dec. 16. Two days later, Savannah, Ga., lawyer Robert Robinson
died after he opened a mail bomb sent to his office. Two other
bombs were sent to targets in Atlanta and Jacksonville, Fla., but
were intercepted by authorities.
   Investigators have searched the homes and businesses of three
men, including Moody, in Alabama and Georgia.
   No arrests have been made in the case.
   Meanwhile, Moody's attorneys sought a gag order Thursday, which
would restrict information about the case.
   The attorneys asked U.S. District Judge Richard C. Freeman to
issue the gag order, to seal all documents in the case and to order
the return of materials seized by agents who searched Moody's
Clayton County home last week.
   The request met opposition from lawyers for several news
organizations.
   Freeman said he needed more time to study documents filed in the
case. He scheduled another hearing for Wednesday, and said that a
portion of the hearing may be closed.
   Moody's lawyers, including the local president of the American
Civil Liberties Union, argued that the intense publicity over the
bombs case has hurt their client's reputation.

   Representatives of China and Hong Kong voted
today to allow the British colony slightly more democracy after it
returns to Chinese rule in 1997.
   The changes were announced Thursday by negotiators drafting a
constitution for Chinese rule. The full committee of 51
representatives adopted the meaasures today in Beijing.
   The measure is to go to the National People's Congress, China's
legislature, for approval at the end of next month.
   But the plan has been widely criticized as too conservative, and
about 1,500 students chanting pro-democracy slogans and waving
placards marched today to the Chinese diplomatic mission to protest.
   The agreements announced would increase the number of seats
directly elected to the 1995-1999 legislatures from 18 to 20. There
are 60 seats in legislature, which is chosen by the government and
special interest groups.
   Since China's crackdown on last year's pro-democracy movement,
Hong Kong and Britain have been pushing for faster and greater
democratization than provided in the first draft of the
constitution, known as the Basic Law.
   In London, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said today that the
agreement produced ``a substantially greater first step toward
democracy in HK than was planned two years ago.''
   ``We shall continue to press the case for a faster pace of
democratization. There will be further evolution between now and
1997,'' Hurd told the House of Commons.
   ``He has caved in completely to China,'' responded Gerald
Kaufman, the opposition Labor Party's spokesman on foreign affairs.
   ``Although he told the people of Hong Kong last month that
Britain alone was responsible for governing Hong Kong until July
1997, his surrender to China on elections to the legislative
council has in fact given China a decisive voice in what happens in
Hong Kong not in 1997, but now.''
   One Hong Kong representative, Dr. Raymond Wu, told reporters
that the decisions represented only ``a little bit of improvement _
bits and pieces.''
   China has pledged to allow the thriving British territory to
retain its capitalist economy and lifestyle for 50 years. Britain
agreed in 1984 to hand over its territory to China when its lease
runs out in 1997.

<TEXT>
   Officials from 24 Western nations
gathered today to consider of litany of requests for financial help
from five Eastern European countries trying to convert to
free-market economies.
   The officials streamed into a building near the headquarters of
the 12-nation European Community to consider the requests of
Romania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany and Yugoslavia.
   The new governments in those once solidly Communist countries
want to be included in a program originally set up last summer to
promote economic and political change in Poland and Hungary.
   Foreign ministers of the 24 Western nations taking part in the
program have agreed in principle to offer assistance to the other
countries to encourage their drives toward democracy and
free-market economies.
   But it was unclear whether the lower-ranking officials meeting
today would give the go-ahead to put together packages of aid for
the others.
   Some had indicated before the meeting a final decision was
unlikely and would probably be deferred to their foreign ministers,
expected to meet later in the year, possibly in June.
   But others today appeared ready to act more quickly. ``You've
got to maintain the momentum,'' said another official as he entered
the conference. He demanded anonymity.
   The plan is one of several Western mechanisms aimed at restoring
economic health to Eastern European economies languishing after
decades of central planning under hard-line Communist rule.
   The aid programs are expected to amount to the largest campaign
of regional assistance since the Marshall Plan rebuilt Western
Europe after World War II.
   In July, President Bush and other key leaders of industrial
nations put the European Community, a group of Western European
nations, in charge of fashioning an economic aid package for Poland
and Hungary.
   Since then, other emerging democracies in Eastern Europe have
appealed for help.
   Officials said Bulgaria, Romania, East Germany, Czechoslovakia
and Yugoslavia have submitted papers giving details of their reform
efforts and outlining their economic needs.
   The appeals varied widely. Romania said the new government has
been left with an economy in ``deep crisis.''
   Czechoslovakia said, ``There is no unemployment in
Czechoslovakia _ however, a considerable part of the labor force is
tied up in inefficient operations.''
   Yugoslavia said it would need $2 billion to rebuild its banking
system and convert to a free-market economy.
   Several expressed concern about the effect of wrenching economic
changes on their people. Bulgaria said an economic program ``has to
be supplemented by a feasible and economically sustainable social
program.''
   East Germany said, however, it can fall back on its well-trained
labor force, agricultural sector and technical base.
   ``Relying on its own performance and making use of the economic
support being offered to it, (East Germany) has an opportunity to
achieve economic reform without going through periods of acute
social tension,'' it said.
   The nations are all trying to move their economies to the
free-market models of the West. But some, such as Poland, are
strapped with hefty foreign debts. Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki has already asked the creditor nations would accept a
moratorium of payments on their share of Poland's $39 billion
foreign debt while he implements a radical economic plan to
transform Poland's economy.
   Their requests are expected to be discussed at the meeting of
the Group of 24, the name given to the Western nations
participating in the program. But officials said they doubted
whether any final decisions would be made on extending the aid
program.
   Foreign ministers of the participating nations are likely to
meet later in the year to settle the question.
   Under the program, about $6 billion has been granted or promised
to Poland and Hungary in the coming years, according to officials.
The aid ranges from emergency food shipments for Poland to export
and investment credits for both countries.
   The Soviet Union has not been invited to submit a request for
help.
   Nations attending the meeting include the European Community
members: Britain, Ireland, Norway, Denmark, Belgium, the
Netherlands, Luxembourg, Germany, France, Spain, Italy and Portugal.
   Also attending were Austria, Australia, Canada, Finland,
Iceland, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey
and the United States.

<HEAD>Judge Yanks Northrop TV Ads During Fraud Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Television commercials featuring Chuck Yeager
promoting Northrop Corp. as a conscientious defense contractor were
ordered off the air by a federal judge presiding over the aviation
company's fraud trial.
   Judge Pamela Ann Rymer said Thursday the commercials could bias
potential jurors.
   The advertisements featuring the legendary test pilot have been
running for several weeks. Jury selection begins Tuesday.
   ``In my judgment, the running of these ads at this time is a
serious threat to the impartiality of the trial on which we are
about to embark,'' the judge said.
   Northrop and two employees are charged with fraud in the AV-8B
Harrier jet program. Northrop is accused of failing to test key
parts the company built for the military jet.
   The judge's order bars the showing of the commercials in the Los
Angeles media market until the end of the trial in her court and
another in which Northrop is accused of fraud in the cruise missile
program.
   The ruling applies only to the ``Hard Work'' series of ads in
which Yeager vouches for Northrop and employees describe the firm
as a hard-working, scrupulous and professional contractor dedicated
to quality.
   Northrop attorney Brad Brian argued that the company had a
``very substantial First Amendment interest'' in using the
commercials to battle bad publicity from the trials.
   Rymer recently was appointed to the U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, but is hearing the case as a federal district judge.

<HEAD>Former Presidents Give Views on Panama Invasion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Nixon says he understands why
President Bush ordered the invasion of Panama, but believes that
generally the United States should not act directly to depose
foreign leaders of whom it disapproves.
   Nixon and former Presidents Reagan, Carter and Ford were asked
by the Sunday newspaper supplement, USA Weekend, for their views on
the invasion of Panama.
   ``I support the Bush administration,'' said Reagan, a Republican
as is Bush. The desposed Panamanian leader, Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, now facing drug charges in the United States, ``is where
he belongs and the people of Panama are beginning to put the pieces
back together,'' he said.
   Ford, another Republican, said, ``I applaud the president's
strong action.''
   Carter, a Democrat, said, ``I deplore the invasion and feel a
great responsibility now for our nation to help repair the damage
caused by U.S. economic embargo and our military action.'' However,
he added, ``Perhaps the invasion can bring about real freedom,
democracy and economic prosperity for Panama.''
   Republican Nixon said, ``I understand why President Bush acted
as he did.'' On the other hand, he said, ``When the United States
decides by itself who is going to run a country, it runs the risk
of ending up running the country itself.''
   Nixon, Carter and Reagan replied in writing to questions
submitted by the publication. Ford was interviewed by telephone.
   All four indicated they had no interest in returning to the
presidency, and all said they believed there should not be a formal
role in government for former presidents, such as a seat as
senator-at-large as has been suggested occasionally.
   ``Our Constitution is clear on who is and who is not an official
part of the government,'' said Reagan.
   Carter agreed that former presidents should have no formal role,
but said they ``should be willing to serve in special cases when
requested by the incumbent president.''
   Similarly, Ford said, ``My experience has been that a sitting
president does call upon a former president informally. And I have
worked with President Carter, President Reagan and now President
Bush when I've been asked to.''
   Said Nixon: ``There is a great deal former presidents can
contribute to thier country, but another bureaucracy should not be
one of them.''

Communist rule in 1957.
   Beech, who began as a copy boy in St. Petersburg, Fla., had a
career that spanned five decades, including positions as a feature
writer with the Akron Beacon Journal and Washington correspondent
for The Honolulu Star-Bulletin.
   He also wrote several books including, ``The U.S. Marines on Iwo
Jima,'' ``Uncommon Valor'' and ``Tokyo and Points East.''
   Beech, a native of Pulaski, Tenn., retired as the Los Angeles
Times' correspondent in Bangkok in 1983.
   He is survived by his wife, Yuko, of suburban Bethesda, Md.; a
daughter and two sons.

<HEAD>EPA Suggests $4.4 Billion in Modifications To Cut Grand Canyon
Haze</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal agency has proposed that $4.4 billion
worth of pollution-control equipment be installed at a northern
Arizona power plant to cut emissions blamed for wintertime haze at
the Grand Canyon.
   The Environmental Protection Agency's proposal has yet to be
approved by the White House and its Office of Management and Budget
and should not be considered definite, officials cautioned this
week.
   ``It's just a proposal at this point. Proposals have been
changed before,'' said Christine Shaver, an attorney with the
National Park Service in Denver.
   David Stonefield, head of the EPA's Office of Air Quality
Research in Research Triangle Park, N.C., said the EPA was
proposing a 90 percent reduction in sulfur-dioxide emissions _ from
300 tons a day to 30 tons _ from the Navajo Generating Station's
three 770-foot stacks.
   The EPA estimates that emissions from the coal-fired plant near
Page fouls as many as 15 percent of the days at the canyon from
November through March. It also says it is possible that the
plant's emissions may cause haze during other seasons.
   The utilities that own the plant, led by the Salt River Project
based in Phoenix, dispute the EPA's contention that the plant is
responsible for haze at the canyon. Salt River officials and
consultants have cited automobile pollution from the Los Angeles
area as a more likely cause.
   John McNamara, a Salt River Project associate general manager,
said he was not surprised by the EPA's proposal, but he said his
utility was pleased that the EPA had agreed to consider Salt
River's own $10 million study into whether the plant is causing the
canyon haze.
   Results of that study are expected before a decision is made on
the EPA proposal, possibly in October.
   The EPA estimated the cost of pollution-control equipment at
$4.4 million, while Salt River has said it would cost $1.6 billion.
   A lawyer in Boulder, Colo., for the Environmental Defense Fund
called the EPA proposal a ``very positive sign.''
   ``It's significant in that they ask for a 90 percent reduction,
which is everything we've asked for,'' said Robert Yuhnke, whose
group filed a 1982 lawsuit that forced the EPA to check into the
canyon haze.

<HEAD>Report: West Germans Approved Weapon Sales to Saudi Arabia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MUNICH, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The West German government has
approved the sale of Gepard anti-aircraft weapons to Saudi Arabia
and deliveries of two submarines to Israel, a newspaper reported
today.
   The independent Sueddeutsche Zeitung said the Krauss-Maffei
company in Munich had applied for permission to deliver about 100
Gepard systems to Saudi Arabia.
   The national security council approved the sale at a recent
meeting, the Munich-based newspaper reported.
   The Gepard systems are outfitted with 35mm cannons designed to
shoot down low-flying aircraft. The systems are mounted on bodies
of Leopard tanks.
   The newspaper said the security council also approved a request
by the Deutschen Werft AG shipbuilding company in Kiel to sell two
``strategic'' submarines to Israel.
   The report did not describe the submarines further.
   The sale of submarines was approved despite misgivings on the
part of West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the
newspaper said.
   West Germany's main opposition Social Democratic Party has
criticized the sales and accused the government of violating laws
that ban arms exports to areas of conflict, such as the Middle
East, according to the report.
   The newspaper quoted the oppostion party's parliament deputy,
Norbert Gansel, as saying that Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government
delivers weapons to war zones to support ``neutrality.''
   ``On all sides weapons are being sold,'' the newspaper quoted
Gansel as saying.
   Gansel, in a statement provided to The Associated Press today,
confirmed the accuracy of the newspaper report and added:
   ``The pretended restrictive arms export policy of the
Kohl-Genscher government has been completed with a sad chapter.
From now on, all dams for arms exports have been broken open.''
   Asked about the reported arms sales to Saudi Arabia, West German
government spokesman Dieter Vogel declined to comment because of
national security concerns.

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York state's education policy-setting
board voted today to change the way history is taught to include
more about contributions by non-whites.
   The Board of Regents voted unanimously to appoint a team of
scholars who will try to wipe out examples of bias from history
books and classroom curricula.
   ``We have to understand better than we now do the diversity of
the country,'' said state Education Commissioner Thomas Sobol.
   The action came seven months after a task force, appointed by
Sobol and dominated by non-whites, released a report that said much
of what school children learn in New York is based on ``hidden
assumptions of white supremacy.''
   The report, titled ``A Curriculum of Inclusion,'' suggested that
many courses minimize the contributions of minorities and largely
ignore the wrongs committed by whites against non-whites.
   The team of scholars, to be picked by Sobol, will study state
curricula to determine how they can be improved. The regents
decided to establish a separate and permanent advisory council to
make sure all ethnic groups receive ``appropriate and accurate
attention'' in classes and books.
   Some regents suggested the changes would be more beneficial to
whites than blacks and other minorities.
   ``Many of our children who have successfully come through our
system do not know each other and do not have a legitimate basis
for developing respect for each other,'' said Adelaide Sanford, a
former high school principal from New York City.
   Regent Walter Cooper said it was important for schools to
incorporate the information about minorities into traditional
textbooks, and not as separate units on non-white cultures.
   One regent, Edward Meyer, suggested putting off action for a
month so it could be studied more. But Sobol, noting the
controversy the report has generated in educational circles, said
any delay would send the wrong signal.
   Some members of the policy-setting board, testy about the
controversy generated by the report in recent months, said the
state has been moving to include more minority contributions for 15
years.
   ``I think the teachers of this state are doing what we've been
talking about here,'' said regent Laura Chodos. ``We just don't
know about it.''

   The family of a woman killed in an
automobile accident involving members of the winemaking Gallo
family has filed a wrongful death suit.
   The lawsuit was filed in Santa Clara County Superior Court after
a California Highway Patrol investigation failed to assign fault in
the accident that killed Sharon Kauk, 27, of San Jose.
   Kauk was killed and her husband and infant son injured Jan. 2
when their car collided on Pacheco Pass with a car driven by Julio
Gallo's wife, Aileen.
   Both Julio Gallo, 79, and Mrs. Gallo, 76, were hospitalized with
injuries suffered in the crash.
   Witnesses gave conflicting reports of the accident. Some told
the Highway Patrol the Gallos' car veered across a double yellow
line and struck the Kauks' car. But witnesses who came forward
about a week after the accident denied that version.
   The lawsuit filed on behalf of Kauk's husband, Timothy, and son,
Matthew, does not specify damages, according to the Kauks' lawyer,
Vincent Ruocco. He said the Gallos have not offered to pay any of
their medical bills.
   Gallo and his brother, Ernest, run the Modesto-based Gallo
Winery which controls 28 percent of the U.S. wine market and
records more than $1 billion in annual sales.

<HEAD>Bulgaria to End Restrictions on Private Farming</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has agreed to end
restrictions on private farming by lifting curbs on how much land
individuals can till, the state BTA news agency reported today.
   A government decree, slated for publication later in the day
``will encourage free enterprise in agriculture,'' BTA said,
reporting on a Cabinet meeting Thursday. ``Restrictions on the size
of land plots available for cultivation by private farmers will be
lifted.''
   Farmers had been allowed private ownership of only small strips
of land, primarily meant to fulfill their own needs and that of
their families.
   BTA did not indicate whether the farmers would now be free to
buy as much land as they wanted or whether they would have to lease
additional acreage for private use.
   The decision was among the efforts by the moderately reformist
Communist government to defuse pressure from the opposition for the
introduction of market mechanisms into the moribund economy.
   Complicating the generally stagnant economic picture in recent
months has been an unprecedented wave of strikes _ generally for
better wages _ that has resulted in the loss of hundreds of
thousands of man-hours of production.
   Bulgaria also is wrestling with a gross foreign debt of more
than $10 billion _ one of the highest per capita in the Soviet bloc.
   In an apparent bid to strengthen its credit-worthiness, the
government also decided to apply for membership in the
International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, BTA reported.

<TEXT>
   A shocked buyer of a stolen VCR found it
contained a homemade child sex tape, recognized the girl and gave
the tape to her mother, leading to a neighbor being jailed on
molestation charges.
   Ward Rafay, 28, was being held pending a March 1 hearing on nine
counts of child molestation and one of possessing a kilogram of
marijuana for sale. He had not made his $50,000 bail and remained
in jail today, said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Bill
Linnemeyer.
   Rafay allegedly owned the sex tape found in a stolen
videocassette recorder, Deputy District Attorney Dean Shotwell said
Thursday.
   Two weeks ago, Rafay reported a burglar stole a VCR from his
Downey apartment about 10 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles.
The unidentified thief then sold the VCR and telltale tape,
Shotwell said. Rafay was arrested last weekend after the mother
contacted police.
   ``The mother of the victim notified us Saturday that she had a
tape depicting immoral acts with her children,'' said Downey police
detective Capt. Bob Williams, who divulged little else.
   ``We don't want to hamper the investigation. We have a
possibility of possibly three other victims,'' Williams said.
   If convicted of all charges, Rafay faces up to 25 years in state
prison, Shotwell said.
   The two-hour tape shows a man discussing sex with a child,
winning her cooperation and engaging in sexual acts with her,
according to police reports.
   The mother wasn't identified, but Shotwell confirmed she lives
with her daughter in the same building as Rafay.

   The first American experiment aboard the
Soviet space station Mir will return to Earth on a Soviet Soyuz
spacecraft Monday, the company that created the experiment said
Friday.
   Payload Systems Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., said the protein
crystal growth will have spent 61 days in orbit, the longest period
in weightlessness for a such an experiment.
   The experiment was launched on a Soviet spacecraft Dec. 20 after
Payload Systems became the first U.S. company authorized by the
Department of Commerce to fly experiments aboard the Mir. The
company has contracted with the Soviets to fly six more experiments
over a four-year period.
   Protein crystal experiments have been flown a number of times on
the U.S. space shuttle, but those flights have lasted only seven to
10 days. Extended exposure to weightlessness is believed to be
important in the growth of protein crystals.
   Experts use protein crystals to understand the fundamental
structure of biological proteins. Once the crystal pattern is
analyzed, companies can make pharmaceuticals that will have
specific effects. Such ``designer drugs'' are believed to be
important in the future treatment of many diseases.
   The company said the experiment should arrive in the United
States on Wednesday and the protein crystals will be removed
Thursday at Brandeis University. The crystals will be analyzed at
the Brookhaven National Laboratory next month.

<HEAD>Military Defense Plan for United Germany Would Include NATO</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with West Germans proposing NATO
military strategy for united Germany, state government system. No

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West German officials today unveiled
plans for a military defense strategy for a united Germany that
would include NATO membership, a move opposed by the Soviet Union.
   The government also announced plans for a 16-state government
that would encompass West and East Germany.
   West German Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg met with
reporters today to discuss a common security concept that he said
was being drafted by his ministry.
   ``Defense obligations are indivisible and cannot be weakened for
a whole Germany,'' Stoltenberg said, noting that military
integration would be an important initial step in a single German
state.
   He said that a cornerstone of the joint force would be its
membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The Soviet
Union has insisted a united Germany be neutral.
   Despite Stoltenberg's proposal, the military alignment of a
united Germany is to be the subject of reunification talks this
year among the German states, Soviets, the United States, Britain
and France.
   Washington wants at least the West German portion to remain in
NATO. East Germany is a key component of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
   Whether Germany should be in NATO or neutral is likely to become
an issue in the West German national elections in December.
   Stoltenberg said there likely would be a transition phase during
which the East and West German armies would be merged. ``But we are
not going to have two different armed forces in a united Germany
for long,'' Stoltenberg said.
   There was no immediate comment from the Soviets or opposition
leaders.
   The governors of West Germany's 11 states met today to discuss
how a united Germany would be administered. In a rare show of unity
among the state leaders split roughly equally between supporters of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and the opposition Social Democrats, the
governors voted unanimously to pursue a 16-state federal structure
once the Germanys are united.
   They proposed that the East German territory be divided into
five states along the borders of the traditional regions, whose
names in German are Brandenburg, Mecklenburg, Sachsen,
Sachsen-Anhalt and Thueringen.
   Their promotion of a strong federal system where individual
states enjoy broad autonomy and influence over the central
government reflects the governors' interest in setting up a united
Germany in the image of the West German and U.S. federal models.
   The conservative governor of Baden-Wuerttemberg state, Lothar
Spaeth, appealed to East Germans to save years of legislative
haggling by simply adopting West German laws and regulations. He
said a wholesale borrowing of the legislation would speed monetary
union and economic reform.
   Kohl's conservative Christian Democrats and the left-leaning
Social Democrats have been wrapping themselves in the reunification
issue in anticipation of the coming elections.
   During a raucous parliament session on Thursday, Kohl was
accused of trying to take credit for the reunification
developments, which have been proceeding at a break-neck pace. Some
officials say one Germany could be formed this year.
   But the race to reunify has some European neighbors and victims
of the Nazi regime worried about the rise of a powerful Germany
that could again threaten peace and security.
   The reunification issue caught fire last year, after the revolts
against hard-line Communist regimes swept into East Germany,
toppling the government but creating a political and economic void.

<HEAD>Woman Who Fought Amputation Dies Following Surgery.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who refused to have a gangrenous leg
removed but changed her mind after a court battle died Friday of
complications related to the operation.
   Doctors at Poriah Hospital in Tiberias said 84-year-old Ruth
Trabelsi died of respiratory complications from the surgery, which
was performed Feb. 9, Israel radio reported.
   A granddaughter, Sara Trabelsi, said the woman had been
unconscious toward the end of the week and that some of her 258
children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren were at her bedside
when she died.
   ``She so much wanted to die with her leg.... Maybe she lost her
will to live without it,'' she told The Associated Press.
   Mrs. Trabelsi's leg became infected last month as a result of
circulatory problems and blood-clotting, but she refused to consent
to the amputation because she wanted ``to enter the Garden of Eden
on both feet.''
   The state took Mrs. Trabelsi to court when doctors said she
would probably die without the surgery, but the case was dropped
when a geriatric specialist testified that Mrs. Trabelsi understood
the possible consequences of her decision.
   Mrs. Trabelsi finally consented to the operation at the urging
of Mordechai Eliahu, one of Israel's leading rabbis.
   Her granddaughter said that Mrs. Trabelsi would be buried Friday
with the amputated limb in accordance with Jewish tradition.
   ``Grandma Ruth will be buried with her amputated leg ... so that
she can fulfill her wish to enter the Garden of Eden on both
feet,'' she said.
   Israel radio Friday quoted hospital doctors as saying the delay
in the operation caused by the court case had not helped Mrs.
Trabelsi's condition and that she had been attached to a respirator
since the surgery.

   Traffic was backed up for miles at the
main border crossing between Italy and Austria on Friday after an
avalanche threat led authorities to close other border points.
   Police said the traffic jam on the Italian side of the Brenner
pass was six miles long.
   Other border points were closed Thursday after Italian
authorities warned of possible avalanches because of heavy snow.
   About six feet of snow fell in the highest areas of the Dolomite
mountains and in the Western Alpine regions this week. Because of
rising temperatures, the ground now is not frozen hard enough to
support the new snow, which ended a long dry spell.
   Helicopters took food and medicine to about 300 tourists blocked
by snow and strong winds in Val Senales, northwest of Bolzano in
the South Tyrol region.
   At least three people have died in neighboring France this week
in avalanches.

<HEAD>Alleged Informer Hacked to Death WHile Hundreds Watch</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of people gathered at a village square
in the West Bank to watch Palestinian militants hack to death an
Arab man who admitted being an informer for Israel, Arab reporters
said Friday.
   The body of the victim, Mohammed Khatatbeh, was left in the
central square in the village of Beit Furik, and his family was not
allowed to bury him in the town, the reporters said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   At least 185 Palestinians have been killed by their brethren
since the uprising against Israeli rule of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip began in December 1987. Like Khatatbeh, most were accused of
cooperating with Israeli authorities.
   According to the Arab reporters, Khatatbeh was kidnapped Tuesday
from his Beit Furik home by six Palestinians armed with pistols and
dressed in camouflage uniforms. The following day, they took him to
the village mosque where he confessed over a loudspeaker that he
had informed on fellow Palestinians since 1968 and once led three
PLO men into an army ambush.
   Israeli officials say Palestinian activists often use torture
and violent interrogations to force such confessions from suspected
collaborators.
   The militants then asked what should be done with Khatatbeh, and
hundreds of villagers poured into the streets and chanted ``Kill
him! Kill him!''
   Khatatbeh was hacked to death with axes and knives in the square
late Thursday as about 250 villagers looked on, the reporters said.
   The army command confirmed that a body was found in Beit Furik
and said the case was being investigated.
   In addition to the alleged collaborators, another 656
Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers or civilians in
the uprising, and 43 Israelis have died.
   Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek said Friday that Israel should give
up the occupied territories and concentrate on absorbing the
hundreds of thousands of Soviet Jews expected to immigrate to
Israel.
   Kollek, Jerusalem's mayor for the last 25 years, said Israel
will need so many human and material resources to handle the
immigration flow ``that I maintain it is impossible to continue at
the same time to occupy the West Bank and Gaza.''
   Kollek's remarks were in an essay distributed by his office in
reply to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's comment Jan. 15 suggesting
that Israel needed to keep the occupied lands to settle some
300,000 Soviet Jews expected to arrive in the next three years.
   Shamir's statement drew angry Arab responses as well as
condemnations from the Soviet Union and United States, which
consider settlement of the occupied lands an obstacle to peace.
Shamir has since reiterated that there was no government policy of
settling immigrants in the occupied lands.
   Also Friday, the Foreign Ministry said European sanctions
against Israel for its handling of the Palestinian uprising were
counterproductive and would discourage peace efforts.
   ``Israel flatly rejects the attempt by the Commission of the
European Community and the European Parliament to suspend certain
activities with Israel,'' the ministry said in a statement. ``These
attempts discourage dialogue and work against peace.''
   A week ago, the European Commission indefinitely postponed two
scheduled European-Israeli seminars, one on economic cooperation
and the other on science.
   Earlier, the 518-member European Parliament voted in mid-January
to recommend freezing scientific cooperation with Israel.
   The parliament and the commission are policy-making bodies of
the European Economic Community.

<HEAD>Too Many Pesticides Used in Tulip Growing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LEIDEN, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tulip growers are flooding local
waterways in this flower-growing region with pesticides, including
such banned substances as DDT, to protect their crops, water
officials said Friday.
   ``All kinds of pesticides were found in surface waters in the
bulb growing area, and their levels were far above the norms in
most cases,'' said Hans van der Hoek, a spokesman for the local
water management board.
   ``In samples, we've even found long-banned substances such as
DDT, aldrin, and dieldrin,'' Van der Hoek told The Associated Press.
   All three are highly toxic substances, but Van der Hoek said it
had not been determined if the pesticide levels in the water were a
threat to public health.
   One-fifth of the Netherlands' 39,500-acre bulb-growing area lies
just north of this western Dutch city. The remainder is spread over
the northwestern and central Netherlands.
   Van der Hoek said that the water management board had launched a
joint study with the bulb growers on how to tackle the problem.
   A spokesman for the Dutch Agriculture Ministry said that ``we're
aware of the problem and working hard to get rid of it.''

   In a major breakthrough, the exiled
leadership of the African National Congress said today it would
send a delegation to South Africa for talks with President F.W. de
Klerk.
   The meeting would be the first ever between the guerrilla
movement's exiled leaders and a South African head of state. The
talks would focus on removing obstacles to formal negotiations.
Both sides say they want to work out a new constitution that would
include the black majority.
   Alfred Nzo, secretary-general of the ANC, also said the
guerrilla movement was prepared to negotiate ``a suspension of
hostilities'' once de Klerk meets the group's remaining conditions
for formal talks. The ANC has said the white-led government must
release all political prisioners, lift the state of emergency and
allow exiles to return before formal negotiations begin.
   De Klerk has said he plans to take these steps, but has not said
when.
   There was no immediate comment on today's ANC statement from de
Klerk's office in South Africa.
   ANC leader Nelson Mandela, released from prison Feb. 11 after 27
years in prison, is to visit the ANC's exile headquarters in Lusaka
next week, probably on Tuesday.
   It was not clear whether the delegation of ANC exiles would go
to South Africa before or after the Mandela visit.
   Nzo said that Walter Sisulu, released in October after more than
25 years in prison, would lead the effort to rebuild the ANC in
South Africa.
   ``It is important immediately to begin the work of
re-establishing the ANC within the country,'' Nzo said, adding that
the organization's estimated 15,000 exiles would soon begin to
return on a large scale.
   Nzo said the ANC ``resolved to meet Mr. de Klerk as soon as
possible to discuss with him the need to address these issues so
that a climate conducive to negotiations is created.''
   The guerrilla movement said the delegation would include exiled
members as well as leaders inside South Africa. That could include
Mandela and Sisulu, although Nzo did not specify anyone by name.
   The ANC, the main black group fighting white rule in South
Africa, has been waging a bombing and sabotage campaign since 1961.
However, the armed struggle has been largely dormant in the past
year and poses no serious threat to the white-led government.
   The announcement followed three days of meetings to evaluate
recent reforms announced Feb. 2 by de Klerk, such as legalizing
more than 60 opposition groups, including the ANC, the release of
Mandela, the easing of press restrictions, and a moratorium on
executions.
   Nzo said the ANC views these reforms ``in a positive light.''
   The ANC, which was banned for 30 years, also said it would open
offices in South Africa.
   De Klerk and his predecessor, P.W. Botha, met with Mandela while
he was in prison. But no South African leader has met with any ANC
leaders as free men.
   Mandela, in an interview today, said he would be willing to meet
with de Klerk to discuss the prospect of negotiations.
   ``I have found him to be a man of integrity with whom I can do
business,'' Mandela said.
   De Klerk wants to negotiate a new constitution that will include
the 28 million black majority in the national government.
   But he opposes a one-man, one-vote system and outright black
majority rule, the basic demand of all leading anti-apartheid
groups, including the ANC. He envisions some mechanism that will
give whites veto power on major policy decisions.

   Barbara Bush kept an active schedule Friday,
saying she felt great following minor skin-cancer surgery that left
her with a slightly swollen lip and a row of stitches below her
nose.
   The first lady was cheerful and energetic as she toured an
interior decorating exhibit benefitting the Washinton Home, a
health care and hospice program with which she has long been
associated.
   Smiling, but not broadly, she replied ``great'' when asked how
she felt following the outpatient operation Wednesday to remove a
small basal cell cancer on her upper lip.
   Her press secretary, Anna Perez, said Mrs. Bush still has some
soreness when she smiles. On Thursday, she told children at a New
York day-care center, ``Don't make me laugh.''
   Accompanied by daughter-in-law Margaret Bush, Mrs. Bush met
several individuals who had rooms of their homes duplicated in the
exhibit, titled ``Entertaining Alfresco.''
   Mrs. Bush's lip was almost imperceptibly swollen. The dozen
stitches were not visible from a few feet away.
   The first lady attended a private luncheon for the exhibit
before travelling to Kennebunkport, Maine, to spend a long weekend
with President Bush at their seaside vacation home.
   On Thursday, Mrs. Bush said the operation had been performed to
remove ``a small cancer that you get because you were stupid and
sat in the sun all your life.''
   Basal cell carcinomas are common skin cancers that occur most
often on the face or areas of skin exposed to the sun.

   An architects' organization has recommended
tearing down the earthquake-damaged Embarcadero Freeway in downtown
San Francisco and replacing it with a waterfront boulevard.
   ``We believe a surface roadway emerges as the better
alternative,'' said Clark Manus, chairman of the urban design
committee of San Francisco's chapter of the American Institute of
Architects.
   The chapter released a report Thursday which concluded that
tearing down the 1.5-mile elevated freeway would be safer, cheaper,
faster and more compatible with other improvements in the area than
rebuilding it.
   Alex Bonutti, president of the AIA San Francisco chapter, called
demolition ``a practical solution which minimizes further
disruption to the city.''
   Before the Oct. 17 earthquake, the freeway carried 60,000 cars a
day.

   A firebomb ripped through a crowded
university lecture hall Friday and injured 40 students, including
13 who suffered severe burns, officials said.
   It was the third such bomb attack in just over a year at
universities in Brussels. No one has claimed responsibility for any
of the attacks.
   The bomb went off at 9 a.m. in a Louvain University auditorium
packed with about 100 students attending a pharmacy class, said a
police official who asked not to be named.
   The explosive device was hidden in a briefcase. It included
fluid soap, which has an effect like napalm when it is part of a
bomb, the official said.
   A similar bomb was used in a Dec 1, 1989 bomb attack at Brussels
University across town.
   ``There was a sudden blast, a big fire and part of the roof came
crashing down,'' said Paul Tulkens, who was in the class Friday.
Some students ran out with hair and clothes on fire. Evidence of a
firebomb was found in the hall, officials said.
   University spokesman Paul Macq said the university had not
received any threats or warnings.

<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Organization for Women was
born in a hotel room in 1965, its name scribbled on a napkin no one
saved.
   Loss of any other details about the beginning of NOW would
hinder future historians seeking to chart the start of the modern
battle for women's equality.
   To preserve the stories of the women who spearheaded the modern
women's movement, Patricia King is coordinating an oral history
project of NOW and founder Betty Friedan.
   The $100,000 project at the Schlesinger Library of women's
history at Radcliffe College is being underwritten largely by Mary
Jean Tully, a former president of the NOW Legal Defense and
Education Fund.
   ``We were creating a revolution, a revolution that's changed ...
the way people think about women, the way they think about men and
the way they think about each other. It also changed the way women
think about themselves, their rights as human beings,'' Tully said
from Juno, Fla., where she was vacationing.
   ``I want my granddaughter to be able to study these things. I
want books to be written about it. It's affected everyone's life.''
   There is little solid documentation of the early years of NOW.
   ``We were using corporate hotel rooms and Xeroxes, lots of
Xeroxes, but there was very, very little written down. We thought
we were changing the world, and nobody was taking notes,'' said
Tully. ``The only way we can get any documentation is the memories
of those of us who were there.''
   Tully is 64. Friedan is 69. Some of NOW's earliest movers and
shakers are now in their 70s. The youngest are reaching 50.
   The oral history project is expected to take three years and
include interviews with about 40 people present at the early
founding and establishment of NOW. It will also contain interviews
with associates of Friedan before and after she wrote ``The
Feminine Mystique,'' the 1963 analysis of women in American society.
   An oral history of NOW also will show the continuity of women's
history and that the movement was much more than one woman, said
Susan Ware, a historian of 20th-century U.S. and women's history at
New York University.
   Ware said she hopes to find in the first-person accounts of
NOW's story a way to ``trace the developing feminist agenda and the
way in which issues like economics and the ERA, the whole
controversy over abortion, how those kinds of issues began to
develop, whether they were divisive, how they were mobilized.''
   The voices of past efforts will have a message for the present
and the future as well, said Ware.
   ``Anytime you study a feminist organization, it forces you to
look again at all the problems women face in our society,'' Ware
said. ``When you study it, you find out how much has changed and
how much remains.''
   Some say the women's movement grew out of the civil rights
movement. Others insist it was really born in the last century with
the effort that culminated in women's suffrage.
   King, director of the Schlesinger Library, points out that other
women's groups preceded NOW. But it was NOW that galvanized
feminists, moved into the grass roots, learned how to use the media
and continues to thrive as a political voice for women.

   At least three people drowned in
two days of flooding in southern West Germany, officials said
Friday.
   The floods, which stopped barge and ship traffic on the Rhine
and Neckar rivers in Baden-Wuerttemberg state, were brought on by
heavy rains and snow in Switzerland, France and West Germany on
Wednesday and Thursday.
   Water from melting snow and rain poured down from steep hills in
the Black Forest region and flooded scores of basements, streets
and homes in dozens of towns in a wide area around Stuttgart.
   Officials raised the known death toll from the flooding to three
after finding a wrecked car Friday and two drowned passengers in
the Gutach river near the town of Triberg. Police said witnesses
spotted the car as it was swept downstream the day before.
   The other death also occurred Thursday when a 41-year-old woman
in the town of Aalen fell into a flooded creek and drowned while
trying to retrieve her umbrella blown away by a gust of wind.
   Police said waters had peaked and conditions stabilized in most
of the hardest-hit areas of the Black Forest region by Friday
afternoon.

<HEAD>Shoe Sorter Finds $3,000 Cash Socked Away in Shoe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Goodwill Industries worker
accustomed to finding change in donated shoes ran across one shoe
with a bit more _ $3,000.
   ``I took one look at that and I said, `Oh, oh, oh,''' said Fred
Kuhrt, who has worked in a Goodwill program for the disabled for 20
years.
   The $20 and $50 bills were in several bank envelopes marked with
the name Mrs. Henry Konarske and an address. Henry Konarske, who is
recuperating from a recent hernia operation, answered the telephone
call from Goodwill employees.
   He said his wife, Martha, died recently, and he had donated some
of her belongings. Then the Goodwill employees told the 90-year-old
retired postal worker about the cash.
   ``I didn't know what to say,'' Konarske said. ``It was a
surprise to me, I didn't know anything about it. Until she got sick
about two years ago, she took care of all the bills.''
   Konarske said he and his niece have found $7,000 in dressers and
shoe boxes around the house since his wife's death. All of the
money has been deposited in a bank.

   Severe thunderstorms in the South spawned tornadoes and caused
flooding that forced hundreds to evacuate today, while thousands
still had no power in the Midwest and Northeast after snow and ice
storms pulled down power lines.
   Flooding after as much as 9 inches of rain closed schools today
in parts of Georgia, Alabama, Kentucky and North Carolina.
   One man apparently drowned in a high North Carolina river today.
Traffic accidents on slippery roads have killed at least 11 people
since Wednesday _ four each in Kansas and Minnesota, two in
Michigan and one in Missouri. Ice also was blamed for a 20-car
crash in Arizona; nobody was injured.
   A section of Interstate 87 was closed in both directions north
of Albany, N.Y., today after four trucks collided.
   Snow and ice on runways and ice on wings closed airports in
Illinois, Oklahoma, Connecticut, New York and Wisconsin.
   Snow and slippery roads closed schools Thursday in parts of 13
states from the Plains to the Northeast, and some remained closed
today.
   More snow was expected to move through the Pacific Northwest and
Great Lakes today, while snow changing to freezing rain threatened
more power outages in northern New England. Accumulations Thursday
reached 8 inches in parts of Wisconsin and Michigan and 7 inches in
Vermont. Craig, Colo., got 24 inches.
   An apparent tornado struck rural central Alabama today, tearing
apart a fire department building in Enterprise and destroying
several mobile homes at Cooper, Chilton County sheriff's officers
said.
   Frank and Judy Higginbotham were in their mobile home with their
9-year-old daughter when lights began flashing and everything
started shaking about 7 a.m.
   ``All of a sudden the roof went one way and the floor went the
other way. I cradled my daughter to my chest and we were blown
through the wall into another room,'' Higginbotham said.
   Alabama's Shelby County received more than 9 inches in less than
24 hours and 30 people evacuated from two trailer parks that were
under 6 to 8 feet of water had to be moved twice.
   ``We had them in an armory, but the water got so high there we
moved to them to the Baptist and Methodist churches in Pelham,''
said Bill Klein of the Alabama Emergency Management Agency.
   It was the third straight week of treacherous weather for
Alabama, and Gov. Guy Hunt on Thursday requested a federal disaster
declaration to aid weather victims.
   In Georgia, a tornado destroyed 15 homes and injured 10 people
in Carrollton today, the National Weather Service confirmed. And at
least 300 people were evacuated today from Trion after as much as 9
inches of rain fell.
   Authorities could not determine if a dam on the Chattooga River
at Trion had burst because ``it's 10 feet under water and the
currents are so fast going across it that they can't see the dam,''
said Chattooga County sheriff's deputy Tammy Owings.
   Western North Carolina got up to 6 inches of rain today and the
body of a trout farmer who apparently was swept away from his
hatchery was found downstream on the French Broad River, police
said. Residents of several low-lying areas were evacuated.
   Schools were closed in four Kentucky counties today because of
high water on roads and 15 to 20 people were evacuated, authorities
said.
   A tornado that wrecked three mobile homes in Louisiana injured
five people, while another twister Thursday destroyed a home and
damaged about 10 others in Copiah County, Miss., but caused no
injuries.
   ``We tried to get out to a ditch near the house, but we couldn't
because it was too bad. The trees across the road were splitting
and blowing away. We just caught each other's hands and prayed. We
just praise the Lord we weren't hurt,'' said witness Ruth Sojourner
of Crystal Springs.
   Flash flooding along a creek in Mendenhall, Miss., forced 250 to
400 people to flee their homes.
   ``It rose about 2 feet in about seven minutes,'' said Brad
McLendon, a Mendenhall police dispatcher.
   The National Weather Service also reported tornado sightings
Thursday in Alabama and Kansas and hail the size of baseballs in
Jackson, Miss.
   Schools were closed Thursday in parts of Washington state,
Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana, Iowa, New York, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Kansas, Missouri and Oregon.
   Ice and snow snarled traffic and knocked out electricity to more
than 146,000 customers Thursday in northern Ohio, although most
service was restored Thursday. At least 42,000 customers lost power
in Illinois and 37,000 remained blacked out today. Outages also
were reported in Indiana and Pennsylvania.
   Some 36,000 customers were without electricity today in
Connecticut after snow and ice pulled down power lines, and Bradley
International Airport outside Hartford was closed for seven hours
during the night. In New York state, at least 32,000 customers had
no power today in the Buffalo area, utility officials said.
   Mail delivery was canceled in Champaign, Ill. Gov. James R.
Thompson declared Champaign County a state disaster area.
   Rain and freezing drizzle swept across much of northern and
central Illinois today, hampering utility crews sent in from
southern Illinois, Indianapolis and St. Louis to help restore power.
   An ice storm in Erie, Pa., pulled down power lines and tree
limbs, causing fires and closing schools. All five TV stations in
the city were knocked off the air and two of them were evacuated
for fear their transmission towers would collapse under the weight
of the ice.

   President Bush met with his Cabinet today to
review the the ``ice-breaking'' drug summit in Colombia and to
discuss the next steps in the international battle against
narcotics.
   Bush waved off reporters' questions at the outset of the Cabinet
meeting, saying, ``We've got a lot of business to do.''
   The president laughed when asked if he was still upset with
reporters over stories that suggested he has sometimes misled the
media. He said Thursday that such reports might lead him to cut
back on news conferences _ but then he held two of them.
   ``I'm going to get upset if you don't get the hell out of
here,'' Bush said kiddingly as reporters were escorted from the
Cabinet Room.
   Bush was flying to Kennebunkport, Maine, later today for a
three-day holiday weekend at his oceanfront home. He returned to
the White House late Thursday night from what he called the
``ice-breaking meeting'' in Cartagena that will lead to more
ambitious international efforts to control drugs.
   ``We, in fact, created the first anti-drug cartel,'' Bush
declared after he and the presidents of Colombia, Bolivia and Peru
signed a communique vowing closer coordination in the war on drugs.
   And while the ``Document of Cartagena'' broke no major new
ground in specifics, Bush hailed the session as ``having forged an
unprecedented alliance against the drug trade.''
   The president said he hopes to enlist U.S. allies in Europe and
elsewhere in the drug fight, and that an international effort
against drug trafficking will be high on the agenda at the July
economic summit of major industrial democracies in Houston.
   ``I'll give a full report'' to U.S. allies ``on this
ice-breaking meeting here,'' he said.
   The United Nations will hold a special session on narcotics
controls next Tuesday through Friday. Secretary of State James A.
Baker III will head the U.S. delegation and speak on Tuesday
afternoon.
   ``The U.S. is hopeful that the special session will result in a
stronger, more balanced multilateral role for the United Nations in
drug control,'' Richard Boucher, a State Department spokesman, said
today.
   Beyond that, Boucher said the United States hoped the United
Nations will concentrate also in the future on ways to reduce
demands for narcotics and supplies of illicit drugs, as well as
suppression of drug traffic and improved treatment and
rehabilitation.
   The communique, which aides said was written before Thursday's
session, calls for a ``world conference against illicit drug
trafficking'' in 1991 and a ``high level'' Latin American followup
in six months.
   It also commits the Bush administration to provide economic aid
to help the three Andean nations wage the drug battle and help
persuade their farmers to switch to legal crops. It calls for
tougher enforcement of drug laws, better exchanges of information
and increased restrictions on the movement of firearms.
   And, it asserts that the drug problem is one equally troubling
to drug-producing nations and drug-consuming ones.
   Bush's journey to Colombia came off without incident amid
intensive precautions for his safety.
   Because of security concerns over the safety of the airport at
Cartagena, Bush flew into and took off from the more secluded
airport in Barranquilla, about 60 miles away. He flew back and
forth between Barranquilla and Cartagena by helicopter.
   But Bush shrugged off any concern about his own safety.
   Asked in Barranquilla if he was surprised there was no violence
to protest his visit, Bush said ``I am not surprised,'' and he
complimented Colombian and U.S. Secret Service security details for
doing a good job.
   Still, William Bennett, the U.S. drug control policy director,
told reporters on the return flight aboard Air Force One, ``A lot
of people told him not to go.''
   ``It was risky, but itwasn't foolhardy _ and this is what
leadership is about,'' Bennett added.
   The communique spelled out that military force could be used to
bolster police activity against drug activity _ but only by each
nation within its own territorial limits.
   That appeared to rule out any Andean role for the U.S. military,
such as stationing warships off the coast of Colombia.
   Bush said he didn't raise the idea of using U.S. ships to
establish a ``radar net'' task force to track cocaine-carrying
aircraft.
   He said, however, that he reasserted ``my intention to interdict
narcotics coming into this country,'' including action on the high
seas.
   Colombian President Virgilio Barco told a Cartagena news
conference after the drug summit that a U.S. naval presence close
to the Colombian coast was ``not necessary. Colombian territorial
waters are being controlled by us.''
   Bush vowed to work to help open U.S. markets to more Andean
nation products and to seek to ease current trade disputes between
Colombia and the United States over coffee and cut flower pricing.
   A key consensus, Bush said, was agreement that growing coca
``for the international drug market is immoral and wrong,'' no
matter how lucrative to Andean farmers.
   Bush has proposed a $2.2 billion, five-year plan for aiding
Andean nations wage the drug battle.
   On the return flight to Washington, a parade of administration
officials visited the press section of Air Force One to declare the
session a success.
   ``This is a real sea-change in the international debate about
drugs,'' said Assistant Secretary of State Bernard Aaronson.
Bennett declared ``this day could be the day these things came to
maturity'' in the drug battle.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III also trumpeted the outcome
of the conference.
   Earlier Thursday, Bush displayed some testiness in a
conversation with reporters, complaining that some recent news
stories had made him sound deceptive and secretive. He said he
might hold fewer news conferences so he wouldn't ``be burned.''
   He referred to stories noting that on Monday, he told a news
conference he did not think it was time for a four-power conference
on German reunification; on Tuesday, an agreement was announced
calling for just such a conference. Bush said he didn't know about
the deal at the time of his news conference.

<HEAD>Red Cross Visits Noriega in Jail</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Red Cross officials today talked with Manuel
Noriega in federal prison, a visit allowed by the United States
under its agreement to treat the deposed Panamanian leader as a
prisoner of war.
   All details of the visit are kept strictly confidential, said
International Committee of the Red Cross spokeswoman Ann Stingle in
Washington.
   Noriega is housed in a special cell at the federal Metropolitan
Correctional Center south of Miami.
   A team consisting of a doctor and a Red Cross delegate visited
the prison today to talk to Noriega and prison officials to ensure
Geneva Convention regulations are observed.
   ``The United States government has granted the necessary
facilities to carry out their work,'' said Jean-Marc Bornet, the
chief delegate for Latin America from the International Committee,
a Geneva-based organization concerned with prisoners' rights.
   After examining a prison, Red Cross officials generally conduct
a private interview with the prisoner.
   They ask only about the conditions of detention, Bornet said,
including subjects such as food, exercise, family contact and
medical treatment.
   Charles Davis, spokesman for the federal prison, confirmed the
Red Cross visit but said he could not release any information on
the delegates' activities.
   After the visit, the team will make a report about Noriega's
conditions at the prison, said Bornet, and that will be sent to the
governments involved.
   Bornet said Noriega's attorneys have contacted the agency about
the Geneva Convention, but that the visit was routine under an
agreement the Red Cross reached with the U.S. government
immediately after the Dec. 20 invasion of Panama.
   The Red Cross also is visiting several other Panamanian
prisoners in the United States, including Noriega's co-defendant
and jailmate, Luis del Cid, allegedly once a top aide to the
deposed leader.
   Noriega's defense team had demanded he be treated as a POW,
saying U.S. civilian courts had no jurisdiction over him.
   The government agreed to the POW treatment, but said he could
still be prosecuted on a 1988 drug-trafficking indictment. U.S.
District Judge William Hoeveler concurred last week, and ordered
the legal proceedings to continue.

   A moderate earthquake shook the city of
Shahrud about 200 miles east of Tehran on Friday, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported. It did not mention casualties or
damage.
   The quake measured 5.2 on the Richter scale, said the report
monitored in Cyprus.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. A magnitude 5 quake can cause considerable damage in a

   The University of California regents'
decision to expand into the state's farming heartland only
eliminates some of the contenders in the political jockeying to
land UC's 10th campus.
   The system's first new campus in a quarter century will bring
jobs, development and a commercial boost to the area chosen.
   Alliances already have split the 16-county central region chosen
Thursday. Tulare and Kings counties have joined forces in the south
while Tuolumne and Stanislaus are fighting together in the north.
   Campaigns range from sweat shirts printed with imagined UC
Merced logos to glitzy promotional videotapes to resolutions by
local governments welcoming a new campus.
   William R. Frazer, UC's senior vice president for academic
affairs, said the region was chosen over the northern and southern
sections of the state because it has the greatest number of people
living more than 50 miles from one of the existing campuses.
   Officials hope to have the campus open by 1998.

   Thousands of Norwegians are putting stress

Norway's popular Joke Line.
   A test of the poetry line drew up to 8,000 calls a month, so the
state phone company made the service permanent, the national news
agency NTB reported Friday.
   Poets from the Norwegian Authors' Center read a 20- to 30-second

``Soon you'll get a poem in your ear.''
   Last year the phone company introduced the Joke Line for comic

<HEAD>Philadelphia Mayor Says He Plans to Write, Teach After Term Ends</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   W. Wilson Goode, who has two years to go on
his second term, says he wants to write and teach after leaving
office.
   The city's charter prohibits a third consecutive term.
   ``I'm going to teach and I'm going to properly record my tenure
in office,'' Goode said this week.
   Goode said he has started recording notes on tape for a first
book.
   ``I'm going to write a book or two and will, I think, tell the
story of my administration, my philosophy _ what I tried to do,
what I did, why I think I missed the mark on some things, why I
think people did not properly give me credit for other things,''
the mayor said.
   During his years in office, Philadelphia has seen a construction
boom downtown, capped by One Liberty Place, the city's tallest
building. Goode's worst day in office was the confrontation with
MOVE radicals, when a bomb dropped on their house on May 13, 1985,
started a fire that killed 11 people and destroyed a neighborhood.
He was elected the city's first black mayor in 1983.
   Goode said he expects the book to help other officials avoid
some of the problems he had.
   The mayor said he had started negotiating for a teaching
position, too.
   ``I'm engaged in discussions with a number of universities at
this time and will by the beginning of 1991 have something set and
will announce it at that time,'' Goode said.

her attempt to hold up a motel clerk when she was tackled by the
clerk's brother, police said.
   Karen Lee Joachimi, 20, of Lake City was being held Friday in
the Columbia County jail on $86,000 bond on charges of armed
robbery, grand theft and two counts of aggravated battery.
   Ms. Joachimi was drunk when she entered the Howard Johnson Motel
late Wednesday night, police Sgt. Billie Carter said Friday.
   She apparently picked up a chain saw that was sitting in one of
the offices and allegedly demanded money from clerk Lucille Ferry.
She did not start the saw.
   Ms. Joachimi allegedly struck the clerk in the head with the saw
and ran toward the door with $300, Carter said.
   But Ms. Ferry's brother Walter Swearengin, who was visiting,
jumped over a counter, tackled Ms. Joachimi and held her until
police arrived.
   No one was injured, Carter said.

   Stepfanie Kramer, who plays Sgt. Dee Dee
McCall on NBC's ``Hunter,'' says it's time to turn in her badge.
   ``After six years on `Hunter,' I feel the time has come for me
to expand creatively into other levels of expression,'' Miss Kramer
said in a statement Thursday. ``This will include focusing on my
music career and future acting projects.''
   The show has yet to decide whether the actress' character will
be killed in an upcoming episode _ or will just walk away at the
end of the season.
   Because ``Hunter'' requires 12-16 hours a day on the set, Miss
Kramer was unable to pursue other roles, her publicist, Susan
Patricola, said. ``And it leaves no time for her social life,'' she
said.
   ``Hunter'' stars former football player Fred Dryer as a Rick
Hunter, a policeman who behaves much like Dirty Harry.
   In the Feb. 24 episode, it will be revealed that McCall and
Hunter have slept together.

   The lineup for this year's Spoleto
Festival U.S.A. is in place with the addition of musicians Chet
Atkins, Chick Corea and Stanley Jordan.
   The festival runs May 25 through June 10.
   ``This will be the finest festival we have ever had,'' General
Manager Nigel Redden said Thursday. ``We wanted this festival to be
an appropriate reaction to the difficulties Charleston has been
through.''
   Redden said ticket sales are running 10 percent ahead of last
year despite a two-month marketing delay caused by Hurricane Hugo,
which smashed into the city on Sept. 21.
   Corea, a pianist who has won numerous Grammy awards, will
perform at the Gaillard Municipal Auditorium on May 28.
   Atkins and Jordan will perform together for the first time on
June 3. Atkins is well-known for more than 100 recordings while
Jordan's album ``Magic Touch'' recently spent a year on the charts.
   The details of the festival's opening concert featuring Leonard
Bernstein also have been finalized with Bernstein scheduled to
conduct Beethoven's Symphony No. 7.
   This season's visual arts program will feature black American
artists and American landscape painters.
   Spoleto productions announced earlier include Richard Wagner's
opera ``Parsifal'' directed by festival founder and artistic
director Gian Carlo Menotti.
   Composer Phillip Glass, poet Allen Ginsberg and artist Jerome
Sirlin will collaborate on a multimedia theater production ``The
Hydrogen Jukebox.''
   The Spoleto Festival U.S.A. was founded in Charleston in 1977 _
two decades after Menotti founded the Festival of Two Worlds in
Spoleto, Italy.

all part of the never-ending effort to keep life simple.''

   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. fired thousands of
workers today as the former junk bond powerhouse continued
dismantling as part of the largest bankruptcy filing in securities
industry history.
   ``There are some tears today. We all regard it as a real shame
and a tragedy,'' said John E. Oden, director of institutional
placement in Drexel's real estate division in Beverly Hills, Calif.
``I feel like it could have been prevented.''
   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder said letters of termination were
sent to the bulk of Drexel's 5,300 workers today. The remaining
employees _ from investment bankers to secretaries _ will stay on
temporarily to finish pending business.
   ``You've got assets here,'' Anreder said. ``We still (have to)
negotiate, try to straighten things out, real estate to unload.''
   The investment firm said it was completing severance packages
for most of the fired workers, which included the 400-member
Beverly Hills junk bond division.
   The operation long headed by Michael Milken was largely
responsible for the firm's rise from the margins of Wall Street to
billion-dollar profits and subsequent decline amid crushing
scandals of the late 1980s.
   The high-yield bond division was devastated last year by the
departure of Milken after his indictment on fraud and racketeering
charges, and the subsequent collapse of the junk bond market.
   As few as 10 to 15 percent of Drexel's 5,300 workers _ the most
talented _ could expect to land jobs, Perrin Long of Lipper
Analytical Services estimated. The securities industry has lost
35,000 people since the October 1987 stock market crash.
   ``This isn't the best of times,'' Long said.
   Drexel employees have been looking for new work since the
investment bank's parent, Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc., filed
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection Tuesday. Many found
banks unwilling to accept their last paychecks because of
uncertainty about whether they would clear, The New York Times
reported today.
   Meanwhile, most of Drexel's multibillion-dollar Treasury
securities portfolio was liquidated by Thursday, aided by a rise in
bond prices in the past week, Drexel executives said. The firm's
junk-bond holdings, estimated to be worth about $1 billion, were
being dumped below market value.
   ``There are parts of this business that are still good and
represent value, and those will be disposed of in an orderly way,''
said Alan Miller, the bankruptcy lawyer handling the case.
   Across Wall Street, competing firms picked at Drexel's carcass
to evaluate what holdings might be worth taking over. Soon to be
ex-Drexel employees were said to be job-hunting alone and in groups
of up to 50 people.
   ``Sure we're looking at their clients. They had lots of good
people working there as well,'' said Joel Cohen, head of mergers
and acquisitions at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp.
   Arthur Kirsch, chief of Drexel's worldwide equity business, told
his 600-member division he still was trying to arrange for a mass
movement to another firm.
   But employees and analysts were skeptical that would happen to
Drexel divisions, which consist of people and contacts, not
products.
   ``I think it's a great proposal but nobody will buy it,'' said
Long of Lipper Analytical Services.
   ``Lincoln supposedly did away with slavery with the Emancipation
Proclamation,'' he said. ``You can't sell people.''

<HEAD>Barry Calls New Drug Charges a `Political Lynching'</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts new 3rd graf, U.S. District, with assignment of judge
and arraignment date</NOTE>

   Mayor Marion Barry vows ``I will be
exonerated'' of new drug-related charges, but a city official is
calling for his resignation and a top adviser wonders whether the
mayor has any political future.
   Barry, 53, was indicted Thursday on five misdemeanor counts of
cocaine possession and three felony counts of lying to a grand jury
questioning him on drug use.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who was assigned
the case today, tentatively scheduled Barry's arraignment for next
Wednesday.
   Meanwhile, close advisers to Barry said Thursday that the mayor
will leave a Florida drug treatment clinic by the end of the month
to continue treatment elsewhere. Barry entered the Hanley-Hazelden
Clinic in West Palm Beach four days after his Jan. 18 arrest on a
cocaine possession charge in what authorities said was a videotaped
hotel sting.
   The new clinic has not been chosen, but an adviser speaking on
condition of anonymity said a top priority will be to ensure that
Barry is isolated from the media.
   Barry, in a defiant statement issued through his office, said
the indictment was ``a continuation of the political lynching and
excesses of the Justice Department in this multi-year,
multimillion-dollar effort to investigate me.''
   ``Now that we will be moving into the courtroom _ which is where
this case should be tried, not in the press _ I am relieved,''
Barry said. ``I know that when a trial is held, I will be
exonerated.''
   Barry has steadfastly denied ever using drugs, and his statement
said he was undergoing treatment for ``the disease of alcoholism.''
   The mayor said he is giving no thought to resigning.
   But one aide, who asked not to be identified, said the
indictment dealt ``a crippling blow, an absolutely devastating
assault'' to Barry's re-election chances if he seeks a fourth
four-year term in November's election.
   Asked if Barry should resign, City Councilwoman Betty Ann Kane
said, ``It might be in his best interests and the city's best
interests. As a person who cares about the city, I would make that
recommendation, now that it's gotten to this point.''
   The Washington Post said in editorial today that Barry ``has
lost any last claim to a position of leadership'' and should resign.
   ``For the sake of the city _ and of all the talent that stands
ready to enlist public support for new leadership in city hall _
Mr. Barry should let go _ entirely,'' the newspaper said.
   Under city law, Barry would be forced to resign if convicted of
a felony, and City Council Chairman David Clarke would become
acting mayor.
   Each of the three perjury charges, stemming from Barry's
association with convicted drug dealer Charles Lewis, carries a
five-year maximum prison term and a maximum fine of $250,000.
   Each cocaine possession charge _ four stemming from Barry's
visits to Lewis' hotel room in December 1988 and one from an FBI
sting operation that resulted in his January arrest _ carries a
maximum sentence of one year in a jail and a fine of $100,000.
   Only one of the possession charges stems from the videotaped
hotel room encounter between Barry and Rasheeda Moore, a one-time
Barry girlfriend who is cooperating with investigators.
   U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens said of the perjury charges, ``Mr.
Barry falsely testified ... that he was unaware of any narcotics
activity by Mr. Charles Lewis, when he stated that Mr. Lewis had
never given him, Mr. Barry, any narcotics, and when he stated that
he, Mr. Barry, had never given any narcotics to Mr. Lewis.''
   Barry told aides privately on the weekend following his arrest
that he would abandon plans for a fourth term, but he has not yet
made any public statement to that effect.
   Stuart J. Long, Barry's financial co-chairman, said the mayor
would face an uphill battle if he decided to run again. ``He's got
the trial, probably a one-week thing, up or down,'' Long said.
``After that, well, who knows?''
   Four candidates, including Clarke, already have announced their
candidacies; Jesse L. Jackson has refused to rule out a campaign if
Barry is not in the race.
   Meanwhile, law enforcement sources said two witnesses _ both
social companions of the mayor _ were called to the federal
courthouse under subpoena but left without testifying just before
the indictments were issued.
   Sources said the witnesses _ Gaylord Tissueboo and former
Birmingham, Ala., official Willie Davis, were expected to be asked
whether they had ever seen Barry use drugs or if they had provided
drugs to him.
   It was not clear whether they or other witnesses would later be
called before the grand jury, which is empaneled until June, the
sources said.
   The federal probe of Barry began in December 1988 after city
police aborted an attempt to make an undercover drug buy from Lewis
when they discovered that the mayor was in Lewis' hotel room.
   Lewis, who pleaded guilty to two cocaine conspiracy charges in
November, testified in court that he had supplied Barry with
cocaine. Lewis, who has cooperated with prosecutors investigating
his relationship with the mayor, has been convicted of selling
crack cocaine to undercover FBI agents in his native Virgin Islands.

   It was no mystery when ``Janet Jackson's Rhythm

mystery to many fans.
   It's true that `R' is the 18th letter in the alphabet and `N' is
the 14th, but that's just coincidence, Jackson said in the March 5
issue of US magazine.
   ``What actually happened,'' Jackson said, ``was that while

   ``Just by a crazy chance we decided to look up when Francis

want me to say, but everyone keeps asking me.''

   African National Congress leader
Nelson Mandela said Friday he is ready to meet President F.W. de
Klerk to try to launch talks on resolving South Africa's racial
conflict.
   Mandela made the comment as the African National Congress
announced in Lusaka, Zambia that it would send a delegation to meet
de Klerk to prepare for negotiations on ending white-minority rule
and sharing power with blacks.
   Mandela said he was ready to play a role in talks on a new
political structure, including meeting with de Klerk. He said he
did not know when such talks might take place and he would have to
consult with the ANC leadership.
   ``They (the ANC) might want me to meet Mr. de Klerk and convey
certain messages. This will be decided by them,'' he said.
   Mandela, who was released from jail Feb. 11 after 27 years in
jail, plans to visit Lusaka, probably next week, for talks with the
ANC's exiled leaders. Mandela's role in the ANC is yet to be
determined, but he is regarded as the most popular and important
black leader in South Africa.
   He said the ANC still wants de Klerk to meet its conditions for
talks, including releasing all political prisoners and ending a
state of emergency. De Klerk, who legalized the ANC and other
opposition groups Feb. 2, has said only political prisoners not
guilty of violent crimes would be released.
   Mandela said he believed the ANC and the government could make
rapid progress. ``We have made it easy for him (de Klerk) that an
agreement should be reached as soon possible. As far as we are
concerned we are fully prepared to cooperate in easing problems
with him.''
   Mandela met earlier Friday with diplomatic representatives of
about 20 nations, including the United States. He outlined his
hopes for South Africa during the closed-door meeting and urged
other nations to help end apartheid.
   Talking to reporters at his home, Mandela was questioned about
the many invitations he has received from world leaders to visit
their countries. President Bush has invited Mandela to Washington.
   The chance to meet Bush was ``an honor'' and an opportunity
which would be ``very important to any people who are struggling
for change in their own country,'' he said. But a decision whether
to accept such an invitation would have to come from the national
executive committee of the ANC, he said.
   Mandela said he was not worried about opposition from right-wing
whites to attempts to end white-minority rule, although they might
pose a threat to his personal safety. He dismissed the white
opposition Conservative Party, saying it had ``no policy at all
except to appeal to rabid racialism.''
   Thousands of whites protesting de Klerk's overtures to the black
majority marched through Pretoria Ton hursday night in a major show
of strength to demand new elections. Police said today that up to
40,000 whites took part in the march.
   De Klerk's decision to free Mandela and legalize the ANC had
created fear and uncertainty among South African whites, the party
said in a statement in its newspaper, Die Patriot.
   ``With one stroke great uncertainty about the future has been
created. The voters have been lied to too often,'' the statement
said.

   The African National Congress said Friday
it is now willing to meet with South African President F.W. de
Klerk to discuss opening talks on ending the group's three-decade
guerrilla war against apartheid.
   Such a meeting would be the first between the guerrilla
movement's exiled leaders and a South African head of state. It
could represent a major step toward finding a solution to South
Africa's black-white divisions.
   The group also said thousands of black guerrillas exiled decades
ago would be returning to their homeland as the once-outlawed group
moves back to South Africa.
   The ANC's national executive committee said delegates would
visit South Africa to try to clear the way for negotiations on
ending white-minority rule and sharing power with blacks for the
first time. The ANC gave no date for the visit.
   The offer follows the government's historic release on Sunday of
Nelson Mandela, the most famous symbol of anti-apartheid
resistance. Mandela was freed to a tumultuous welcome after 27
years in prison.
   Alfred Nzo, secretary-general of the ANC, also said the
guerrilla movement was prepared to negotiate ``a suspension of
hostilities'' once de Klerk meets the group's remaining conditions
for formal talks.
   ``To achieve this objective, in the shortest possible time, the
National Executive Committee resolved to meet Mr. de Klerk as soon
as possible,'' the anti-apartheid group said.
   The group's conditions for formal talks are a lifting of the
state of emergency and the release of all political prisoners.
   A South African government spokesman said his administration was
waiting to see the ANC statement and would have no immediate
response. But it was unlikely that de Klerk would refuse such a
meeting.
   The ANC, the main black group fighting white rule in South
Africa, has been waging a bombing and sabotage campaign since 1961.
However, the armed struggle has been largely dormant in the past
year and poses no serious threat to the white-led government.
   Mandela said Friday he was ready to meet with de Klerk to
further negotiations and end apartheid. Mandela, released Sunday
after 27 years in jail, is expected to visit Lusaka next week to
consult with the exiled leadership.
   ``I have found him (de Klerk) to be a man of integrity with whom
I can do business,'' Mandela said at his home in Soweto, outside
Johannesburg.
   The ANC said de Klerk still had not met all conditions to clear
the way for talks on creating a new political structure for South
Africa and cited the 3{-year-old state of emergency.
   The statement also called for an end to all political trials and
army troops be removed from black townships.
   Nzo said the ANC ``resolved to meet Mr. de Klerk as soon as
possible to discuss with him the need to address these issues so
that a climate conducive to negotiations is created.''
   ``The meeting agreed that the Pretoria regime had not yet
created a climate conducive for negotiations,'' Nzo said.
   Nzo said that Walter Sisulu, released in October after more than
25 years in prison, would lead the effort to rebuild the ANC in
South Africa.
   ``It is important immediately to begin the work of
re-establishing the ANC within the country,'' Nzo said.
   He said the organization's estimated 15,000 exiles would soon
begin to return on a large scale.
   The guerrilla movement said the delegation would include exiled
members as well as leaders inside South Africa. That could include
Mandela and Sisulu, although Nzo did not specify anyone by name.
   The ANC's statement followed three days of meetings to evaluate
recent reforms announced Feb. 2 by de Klerk, such as legalizing
more than 60 opposition groups, including the ANC, the release of
Mandela, the easing of press restrictions, and a moratorium on
executions.
   Nzo said the ANC views these reforms ``in a positive light.''
   The ANC, which was banned for 30 years, also said it would open
offices in South Africa.
   De Klerk and his predecessor, P.W. Botha, met with Mandela while
he was in prison. However, no South African leader has met with any
ANC leaders as free men.
   De Klerk wants to negotiate a new constitution that will include
the 28 million black majority in the national government.
   But he opposes a one-man, one-vote system and outright black
majority rule, the basic demand of all leading anti-apartheid
groups, including the ANC. He envisions some mechanism that will
give whites veto power on major policy decisions.

   The chief mate of the Exxon Valdez said
today that in the first minutes after the tanker went aground, he
thought the skipper was trying to move the ship off a reef but
later decided to keep it stable.
   James Kunkel, concluding his testimony in Joseph Hazelwood's
criminal trial, said the captain of the tanker never told him
whether or not he was trying to slide the ship off the jagged reef
_ a move prosecutors say could have caused it to capsize and sink.
   Jurors already had heard a tape recording of conversations
between Hazelwood and the Coast Guard on March 24 after the
nation's worst oil spill indicating Hazelwood tried to move the
grounded ship.
   Kunkel testified that his first report to the skipper, upon
checking computer readings after the disaster, was that the ship
was stable.
   ``On the basis of the instructions and commands the captain was
giving you, did you believe the captain was trying to keep the
vessel on the reef?'' asked Hazelwood lawyer Michael Chalos.
   ``At that time, no, I did not,'' Kunkel said. ``I felt that
perhaps we were trying to get off the reef at the beginning.''
   Minutes later, he said Hazelwood told him to ``ballast the ship
down'' and it was clear he was trying to stay on the rocks.
   ``We are working our way off the reef,'' Hazelwood was heard
saying in a radio message minutes after the tanker was gashed open
and began spilling oil into Prince William Sound.
   The port commander warned Hazelwood against doing ``anything
drastic'' and suggested, ``I wouldn't do much wiggling.''
   The prosecution hopes to establish that Hazelwood's effort to
extricate the ship demonstrates his recklessness, which must be
proved for a conviction on the felony charge and one of three
misdemeanor counts that Hazelwood faces. Defense attorneys say
Hazelwood's orders were aimed at stabilizing the tanker on the reef.
   The Coast Guard tape, played in a hushed courtroom, began with
routine inquiries from Hazelwood about ice conditions and his
report that he planned to divert around shipping lanes to avoid
ice. Shortly after midnight, Hazelwood called the vessel traffic
center again.
   His voice was gravelly and he sighed as he said, ``It's Valdez
back. We should be on your radar. We've fetched up hard aground....
Evidently we're leaking some oil and we're going to be here for
awhile.''
   Within minutes, the captain of the port, Coast Guard Cmdr.
Steven McCall, called Hazelwood asking for more information.
   ``A little problem here with the third mate but we are working
our way off the reef,'' Hazelwood said. ``The vessel's been holed
... right now we're trying just to get her off the reef and we'll
get back to you as soon as we can.''
   The third mate, Gregory Cousins, was in control when the ship
grounded. He has blamed the accident on the helmsman's inability to
take steering orders.
   Kunkel testified Thursday the skipper had a calming influence on
the crew in the wake of the accident.
   ``What was the captain's demeanor?'' asked Hazelwood lawyer
Michael Chalos.
   ``Very sullen, but all business,'' said Kunkel. ``Cool, calm, in
charge.''
   Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y., is charged with
second-degree criminal mischief and misdemeanor charges of reckless
endangerment, negligent discharge of oil and operating a vessel
while intoxicated. If convicted, he could draw up to 7\ years in
prison and $61,000 in fines.
   Kunkel, in charge of loading the ship's cargo of oil, said he
rushed to the cargo room after the grounding and saw the oil gauges
dropping. He said he programmed the ship's computer with facts
about the grounding and it told him ``the ship could not go out
onto a seaway.'' He said he relayed this to Hazelwood.
   Kunkel said he had warned Hazelwood earlier that the helmsman,
Robert Kagan ``needed practice in steering'' and required ``special
supervision'' in even the simplest tasks.
   Kunkel said he sailed with Kagan four years earlier and wrote an
evaluation saying the seaman ``tended to drift off'' while steering.
   He said he once assigned Kagan a simple task painting a bulkhead
but found he had to watch him to ensure he used the right paint and
brush.
   But Kunkel said he had ``no doubt'' that Kagan was capable of
executing a 10 degree right rudder turn _ which Cousins has said
Kagan failed to achieve at the crucial moment.
   The Exxon Valdez spilled 260,000 barrels _ or 10.92 million
gallons, Kunkel said.
   After the grounding, Kunkel said he and Hazelwood discussed
abandoning ship, but the skipper feared there would be panic among
the crew. Lifeboats were lowered as a precaution, he said.
   The prosecution contends Hazelwood risked the lives of crew
members by letting them sleep through the disaster, but Kunkel said
he thinks abandoning ship would have been riskier.
   ``It was the middle of the night,'' the chief mate said. ``...
In Prince William Sound it's always pretty dangerous to put people
in the water.''

<HEAD>Namibia Elects Sam Nujoma as First President</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HEIDI VON EGIDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sam Nujoma, a former guerrilla leader
who spent 30 years in exile, was elected Namibia's first president
Friday and will take office when the territory wins independence
from South Africa on March 21.
   Nujoma helped found the South-West Africa People's Organization
in 1960 and led it through a 23-year bush war against South African
rule of Namibia, Africa's last colony.
   ``On behalf of the Namibian people and myself I want to express
my sincere appreciation for the trust and honor you have bestowed
upon me,'' he told the 72-member Constituent Assembly after its
unanimous vote.
   ``I call on all Namibians to remain united behind our government
and work together for peace and stability,'' he said.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar will swear Nujoma
into office on Namibia's independence day. Namibia's South African
administrator, Louis Pienaar, will remain in charge of the
territory until then.
   More than 20 heads of state are expected to attend the
independence ceremonies. SWAPO leaders say they will invite both
South African President F.W. de Klerk and recently released African
National Congress leader Nelson Mandela.
   Nujoma will serve five years, then will be eligible for a second
term. However, the constitution limits a president to two five-year
terms, a rarity on a continent where most leaders serve for life.
   South Africa, which has ruled Namibia since 1915, agreed to
grant the territory independence under a regional peace accord
signed in 1988 with Angola and Cuba.
   More than 6,000 U.N. military and civilian personnel have been
monitoring the transition to independence, which began in April.
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson attended the assembly session Friday and
was allowed to speak to its members.
   ``I'm impressed by people civilized enough to agree and
disagree,'' Jackson told the assembly. ``This is an example of how
a democratic society can work when people move from polarization to
coalition.''
   Jackson, a former U.S. presidential candidate, completed an
eight-day visit to South Africa on Thursday and said Namibia could
become a ``shining example'' of democracy for South Africa.
   Jackson, who has known Nujoma for many years, told the Namibian
leader that ``God has rewarded you for all your suffering.''
   Jackson said he would urge the U.S. government to increase aid
to Namibia and other black-ruled countries in the region.
   Leftist SWAPO won 41 of the assembly seats in elections last
November; six other parties captured the remaining 31 spots.
   Despite a hard-fought election and sharp ideological
differences, the parties quickly worked out a democratic,
Western-style constitution that was unamimously approved earlier
this month. Also, Nujoma has named whites, businessmen and
opposition party members to his Cabinet in a bid to heal the deep
divisions caused by a war that lasted from 1966 until April 1989.
   Nujoma, 60, has little formal education, but is considered a
shrewd, instinctive politician who has maintained leadership of his
organization despite several challenges over the years.
   He helped found the Ovamboland People's Organization, the
forerunner to SWAPO, in the late 1950s. He went into exile in 1959
and was named president of newly formed SWAPO in 1960.
   Under his leadership, the movement was recognized by the United
Nations as the ``sole and authentic representative of the Namibian
people'' although the territory had dozens of political parties.
   Nujoma helped launch SWAPO's guerrilla war in 1966 and traveled
widely during his years in exile, particularly to communist and
Third World countries.
   In exile, he generally was portrayed as a Marxist, but has
sounded much more moderate since returning to Namibia in September.
Even his political opponents have praised his efforts at
reconciliation, and the transition to independence has gone much
more smoothly than most observers expected.

   The Soviet Union agreed to letting the United
States have more troops in Europe because it expects events to make
irrelevant within ``a year or two'' the newly agreed-upon ceilings,
Soviet spokesman Gennady Gerasimov said Friday.
   ``We want to lower the level of military confrontation in
Europe,'' said Gerasimov, a spokesman of the Soviet Foreign
Ministry, in a telephone interview on National Public Radio's
Morning Edition.
   ``We want it to be zero confrontation, and we want foreign
troops to be removed from foreign soil everywhere,'' he said.
   Gerasimov said the Soviets didn't accept the U.S. argument that
the United States needs to have 30,000 more troops in Europe than
the Soviets because of the difficulty in moving forces across the
Atlantic in the event of a conflict.
   But the Soviets decided to accept President Bush's proposal for
195,000 troops for each superpower in Central Europe with an
additional 30,000 Americans allowed elsewhere in Europe to clear
the way for a Europe-wide treaty on cutting conventional forces,
Gerasimov said.
   ``The political situation in Europe is changing at such a pace
that a year or two from now these figures of 195,000 and 30
additional thousand will become irrelevant,'' he said. ``This is my
hope.
   ``So not to stop this process with small obstacles we decided to
make this concession to common sense,'' Gerasimov said. ``... If
you want to keep additional troops, it's your taxpayers' money.''
   He said he had been reading remarks by French President Francois
Mitterrand that alliances can exist only if they have enemies,
suggesting that the Warsaw Pact and the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization ``may fade away.''
   ``Today nobody in his right mind can argue that the Soviets want
to attack Western Europe,'' said Gerasimov. ``And I hope that
nobody in Western Europe or in your country thinks in terms of
attacking Eastern Europe or the Soviet Union.''
   Military capability must be cut to be in line with the good
intentions of both sides because intentions ``may be changed
tomorrow,'' he said.
   The Soviet Union continues to oppose U.S. demands that a
reunified Germany remain a member of NATO, but the diminished
importance of the alliances could make the issue irrelevant,
Gerasimov said.

   A court on Friday ordered Eurotunnel to pay
contractors $114 million for their work on a rail tunnel under the
English Channel.
   The Commercial Tribunal of Nanterre in suburban Paris made the
ruling on behalf of Transmanche Link (TML), the consortium of
contractors working on the project.
   The decision follows a series of conflicts between the parent
company and the Anglo-French consortium. A Eurotunnel spokeswoman
said the company will appeal.
   The dispute stems from TML's refusal to sign a financing
agreement with Eurotunnel and creditors allowing Eurotunnel to draw
$701 million from the $8.7 billion in new loans granted to the
venture.
   The Eurotunnel spokeswoman said the company lacks the funds to
pay TML because the consortium refuses to sign the agreement and
free up new loans.
   Disagreements between TML and Eurotunnel have centered on the
appointment of Alistair Morton, former British president of the
parent company, as the new chief executive.
   Eurotunnel stock fell 60 cents per share to $9.39 on Friday with
1.9 million shares changing hands.
   The tunnel, being built from both sides, is due to be opened in
mid-1993 to rail traffic. About a third of the 34-mile project is
complete.

<HEAD>Bonner: Gorbachev Gets Too Much Credit for Soviet Changes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet human rights activist Yelena Bonner
said today that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev deserves praise for
his foreign policy but gets too much credit for changes taking
place in the Soviet Union.
   ``We do not know what it is he wants,'' Bonner said at the
opening of a forum on human rights. ``Is he only interested in
personal power? Or he is interested in the rights of the people?''
   Bonner appeared at the Peace Prize Forum at Augsburg College in
place of her husband, Nobel Peace Prize winner Andrei Sakharov, who
had been scheduled to address the forum before his death in
December.
   She said Gorbachev's actions in allowing changes in the Soviet
bloc are widely misinterpreted by Western countries. She said
revolts have been brewing for a long time and Gorbachev deserves
credit only for not stamping them out.
   Bonner said the Soviet Communist Party's platform issued three
days ago has only slight changes from party platforms of past
decades.
   She also said Gorbachev's initiatives in making elections more
democratic came too late because the changes were made after the
deadline for filing for office had closed. The elections, scheduled
in March in the Soviet Union, are extremely important, she said.
   ``If he would have done this six months ago, it would have been
a courageous act,'' Bonner said. ``But now, so what?''
   She also said people in the Soviet Union are afraid Gorbachev is
claiming too many powers.
   ``Gorbachev has shown himself as a very strong leader in the
struggle for his own power and his own survival,'' she said.
   Bonner also criticized Gorbachev for using military force to
handle demonstrations and other disruptions.
   ``The analysis of the Western media stops at, `Poor Gorbachev,
how difficult it must be for him to govern in such
circumstances,''' she said.
   Bonner opened the forum with a news conference also attended by
former Vice President Walter Mondale. Her remarks in Russian were
interpreted in English by her son.
   The theme of the Peace Prize Forum is ``Human Rights in the
Global Village.'' It is sponsored by five colleges of the
Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, including Augsburg, and is
being held in conjunction with the Oslo-based Norwegian Nobel
Institute, which awards the Nobel Peace Prize.
   Sakharov won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975 for leading the human
rights movement in the Soviet Union for decades.

<TEXT>
   A mass of molasses oozed through two
blocks of Colorado's ``Sweetheart City'' on Friday after a storage
tank ruptured, forcing a kindergarten to close and blocking several
businesses.
   No one was injured, but before the syrupy mess was identified,
authorities took precautions against what they thought was a
potentially dangerous chemical spill.
   Word of the spill reached authorities early Friday after a car
spun out of control on a slippery substance and ran into a ditch.
   City Manager Mike Rock said two young males were in the vehicle
and ``one of them told me it was like hitting glare ice. His
windshield was so splattered with the stuff he couldn't see.''
   The molasses was steaming when it escaped but it thickened in
the 5 degrees below zero temperature. It flowed down a busy street,
into an industrial park and on into an irrigation ditch where it
ran for another half-mile, said police Cpl. Al Sharon.
   ``It gives a whole new meaning to the term Sweetheart City,''
Sharon said.
   Sharon estimated the ruptured tank was three stories high and 30
to 50 feet in diameter.
   Jack Fulton, director of government relations for Western Sugar
Co., owner of the molasses, said 3,400 tons or about 618,000
gallons were in the tank leased from Great Western Salvage Co.
   ``We have engineers on the scene trying to determine the best
way to clean up the spill,'' Fulton said.
   The molasses is used as an animal-feed supplement, often added
to barley or other grains.
   Traffic was directed away from Madison Avenue, which was covered
with 1 to 7 inches of sticky, brownish-black goo.
   Rock said of the cleanup effort, ``maybe we need to bring in a
big bunch of pancakes.''
   This city of approximately 30,000 people, 53 miles north of
Denver, postmarks special Valentine's greetings on thousands of
envelopes each year at this time.
   The kindergarten and businesses in the industrial park were
closed because their entrances were blocked by the running mass.

<HEAD>U.S. Commission Says European Airport Security Has Improved</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. commission on aviation security and
terrorism appointed after the Flight 103 disaster said Friday that
airport security has improved in Europe but Africa is a ``basket
case.''
   ``If there is an Achilles' heel in aviation security, it is
Africa, which is literally a basket case,'' said U.S. Rep. James L.
Oberstar, chairman of the House Public Works and Transportation
Subcommittee on Aviation.
   Oberstar said cited poor training for security personnel, high
staff turnover, insufficient detection equipment, and economic
pressures on African governments.
   Oberstar, a Minnesota Democrat, was speaking at a news
conference given by the commission near the end of a week of
consultations with airline, government and security officials in
West Germany, France and Britain.
   The commission is to report in May to President Bush on American
policy toward the terrorist threat to civil aircraft and to make
safety recommendations.
   Bush appointed the seven-member commission after Pan AM Flight
103 from Frankfurt to New York via London was blown up by a
terrorist bomb over the Scottish town of Lockerbie on Dec. 21,
1988. All 259 people aboard the Boeing 747 and 11 people on the
ground were killed.
   Oberstar said the attitude of France toward the terrorist threat
to aircraft had changed markedly since Sept. 19, when a DC-10 of
the French airline UTA crashed in Niger, West Africa, killing all
171 passengers and crew. UTA said the apparent cause was a bomb.
   ``The attitude in France a year ago was this is an American
problem,'' said Oberstar. ``After UTA the (French) attitude is it
is a worldwide problem.''
   The French government has given more than $5 million to African
countries to train airport security personnel since the UTA
disaster, the commissioners said.
   They added that the attitude toward air security generally was
tougher in Europe than a year ago. West Germany, for example,
markedly improved its system of checking baggage and passengers.
   ``The fact is right now, I think we are improving,'' said
commission leader Ann McLaughlin, a former U.S. labor secretary.
   Commissioner member Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato, R-New York, said no
one still knew for sure where the radio-cassette bomb was put
aboard Flight 103. British officials maintain it was in Frankfurt.
   West German police seized similar bombs in October 1988 and
arrested 16 Palestinians, but soon released all but two of them.
including a Jordanian suspected by some of assembling the bomb in
Frankfurt that blew up the Pan Am flight.
   The commission members will spend the day in Lockerbie on Sunday
before going home.

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Improves But Still Tops $100 Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A surprisingly large 30 percent trade-balance
improvement in December allowed the nation to close out 1989 with a
$108.6 billion deficit, the smallest in five years, the government
said Friday.
   While conceding that most of the December improvement was
dependent on special factors, the Bush administration hailed the
8.4 percent narrowing in the deficit for the year as evidence that
the administration's effort to open foreign markets was succeeding.
   However, private economists were not as enthusiastic, pointing
out that while U.S. exports hit an all-time high last year, so did
imports, driven upward by America's growing dependence on foreign
oil.
   Some economists forecast that the deficit this year will resume
worsening as consumers continue their love affair with imported
products and the foreign oil bill rises.
   But other economists were not as pessimistic, believing that
1990 would show another slight improvement in the deficit, although
probably not enough to dampen protectionist cries in Congress.
   ``The trade deficit is coming out of a six-month period of
deterioration but what happened in December overstates whatever
improvement is occurring,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of
the Boston Co.
   In other economic news, the government said that industrial
production fell 1.2 percent in January, pushing the operating rate
at the country's factories, mines and utilities down to 81.9
percent, almost 2.5 percentage points below where it was a year ago.
   While much of the January drop was a factor of unseasonably warm
weather reducing the need for utility production, analysts said
much of American industry, particularly automaking, remains in a
slump.
   The 1989 trade deficit followed a $118.5 billion deficit in 1988
and was the smallest since a $106.7 billion deficit in 1984.
However, it still represented the sixth consecutive year that the
difference between imports and exports remained above $100 billion.
   Many econmists believe the huge trade deficits are symbolic of
America's inability to compete internationally. But the Bush
administration maintains that after hitting a record high of $152.1
billion in 1987, the past two years of trade improvements showed
that the country was regaining many of its lost overseas markets.
   Commerce Undersecretary Michael Darby noted that U.S. exports
climbed by 13 percent last year to an all-time high of $364.3
billion, while imports were up 7.3 percent to $472.9 billion, also
a record high.
   ``Growth in exports was strong across most categories of goods,
including a wide variety of manufactured goods, especially
machinery and telecommunications equipment,'' Darby said.
   However, the export increase was just half the 26 percent rise
enjoyed during 1988, a year when American manufacturers benefited
from a falling dollar that made their goods more competitive on
overseas markets.
   While economists at DRI-McGraw Hill forecast that the trade
deficit will climb to $123 billion this year, other analysts
forecast it would dip to just under $100 billion, reflecting their
belief that strong growth overseas would provide markets for
American products, helping to offset the negative impact of higher
oil imports.
   In 1989, oil imports surged by 27.2 percent to $48.94 billion,
$10.5 billion more than in 1988. It was the highest yearly total
since a $52.4 billion foreign oil bill in 1984.
   The American Petroleum Institute said Thursday that imports hit
a record 54 percent of total U.S. demand during January while
domestic production was falling to its lowest level in a
quarter-century.
   ``Petroleum must become the principal issue in the trade debate.
We are becoming very dependent again on imported petroleum,'' said
Barry Rogstad, president of the American Business Conference, a
coalition of fast-growing, medium-sized companies.
   As usual, the country's largest imbalance in 1989 was with
Japan, a $49 billion deficit that accounted for 45 percent of the
total. This was down only slightly from a $51.8 billion deficit in
1988 with Japan, but some economists noted as encouraging the fact
that U.S. export sales to Japan were up by 18.2 percent, helping to
offset a 4.5 percent rise in Japanese imports.
   The United States enjoyed a rare surplus of $1.5 billion with
the 12-nation European Community, a sharp turnaround from a $9.2
billion deficit in 1988.
   After Japan, the largest deficits occurred with Taiwan, $13
billion; Canada, $9.62 billion; South Korea, $6.26 billion, and
China, $6.18 billion. One of the biggest surpluses was with the
Soviet Union, with U.S. exports exceeding Soviet imports by $3.57
billion.
   The December deficit of $7.17 billion was the lowest monthly
imbalance since a $6.79 billion deficit in December 1984.
   The 30 percent improvement from November's $10.29 billion
deficit occurred because exports rose 2.4 percent to $31.11
billion, the second-highest level on record, while imports fell 5.9
percent to $38.28 billion.
   Exports were up in December in large part because of a big jump
in sales of aircraft and parts, reflecting the end of the Boeing
strike. There were smaller increases in office equipment, artwork
and antiques and industrial machinery.

<HEAD>Property Bill Sent Back to Committee</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet legislators said a bill legalizing private
property was too vague and sent it back to committee Friday, then
took up legislation that would let invididuals own land.
   Legalizing two fundamentals of capitalism banned for generations
in this Communist state is intended help revive the moribund
economy by spurring individual initiative and attracting foreign
investment.
   Alexander Nikonov, president of the All-Union Agricultural
Academy, told the Supreme Soviet legislature the proposed Law on
Land gives farmers a voice in choosing the appropriate form of
ownership and how to use profits from their harvests.
   Agricultural land now is distributed among state and collective
farms. The constitution, which must be changed if the bills become
law, says ``the land, its minerals, waters and forests are the
exclusive property of the state.''
   Debate on the land bill is to continue next week.
   The deputies decided to consider the separate private property
bill again in a week, after the committee work, and vote separately
on each of its 35 provisions.
   That law would legalize ownership of ``means of production,''
but it does not define the term, and says even foreign companies,
once scorned as agents of imperialism, may own factories and
buildings.
   Legislator Vladimir Tikhonov, an agricultural scientist,
complained that, while the draft Property Law mentioned the right
to own property, nothing in it required the often recalcitrant
Soviet bureaucracy to sell property.
   Other deputies, in the second day of debate on the property
bill, said it was not clear.
   ``Everything in the draft law has two meanings,'' said Anatoly
Sobchak, a prominent reformist from Leningrad. He said the law must
say private ownership of ``any form of property'' is legal.
   In an appeal Thursday for approval of the property bill, Justice
Minister Veniamin F. Takovlev said: ``If we want to have a market
economy and take part in the international marketplace, then we
need such a law.''
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's five years as Soviet leader
have brought many upheavals in politics and society, but few
official proposals have the breadth of those on property and land.
   Citizens who were taught for generations that ``property is
theft'' now are being asked to accept private ownership along with
ownership by collectives and the state.
   In other action, 100 deputies said they had formed a
parliamentary faction called Soyuz, Russian for union, to ``resist
the breakup of the U.S.S.R.''
   They appear to be opposing Baltic representatives, who seek
independence for their republics, and the Interregional Group, an
alliance of Boris N. Yeltsin and others who demand radical economic
and political reform.

   Most states are going along with an experiment
to waive family income rules so people receiving food stamps can
work on the 1990 census without losing their monthly benefits, the
Agriculture Department said Friday.
   Assistant Secretary Catherine Bertini, who oversees USDA food
and consumer services, said the program will enable participating
families some extra income and provide the Census Bureau with
much-needed temporary assistance.
   The bureau expects to hire about 300,000 temporary workers to
help with the count, which is conducted every 10 years. Pay will
range from $4.50 to $9 per hour, depending on the region and type
of work.
   Normally, additional income would lead to a reduction in food
stamp benefits, which are based on household size, income, assets
and other factors.
   ``So far, all but seven states _ Alabama, Connecticut, Florida,
Georgia, Idaho, Kansas and New Hampshire _ have indicated they
would participate,'' Bertini said.
   The Family Support Administration of the Department of Health
and Human Services will conduct a similar demonstration project
using waivers for recipients of aid to families with dependent
children (AFDC), the announcement said.

   The Federal Election Commission said Friday it
won't appeal a judge's ruling that it improperly dismissed a
complaint alleging a Republican Party fund-raising group illegally
funneled more than $2 million to 1986 Senate candidates.
   That means the FEC accepts the judge's order to reconsider the
complaint, an action that could result in a hefty fine against the
National Republican Senatorial Committee.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell, ruling Jan. 24 on a
lawsuit filed by Common Cause, said the FEC's initial refusal to
act on the complaint ``cannot be upheld, because it ignored the
plain language of the applicable regulation and was not rationally
explained.''
   The commission's only alternative to reconsidering was to
appeal, which FEC spokeswoman Sharon Snyder said the commissioners
decided not to do.
   ``This action involved very serious violations of the law and
now the commission has to go back and determine what the proper
penalties are,'' said Common Cause President Fred Wertheimer.
   Common Cause alleged that the NRSC violated contribution limits
by illegally funnelling proceeds of a fund-raising campaign to 12
Republican Senate candidates.
   The NRSC, through letters signed by then-Vice President Bush,
raised about $2.8 million and gave it to the candidates, all of
whom ultimatelty lost as the Democrats regained control of the
Senate. No candidates were identified in the various versions of
the letters.
   By the time of the fund-raising campaign, the Republican Party
already had made the maximum contribution it was allowed to make to
each Senate candidate. Common Cause complained to the FEC, saying
the NRSC had pushed the party over the limits by giving the
proceeds of the letter-writing campaign to the candidates.
   The NRSC contended the donations could be treated as individual
donations to the candidates, but Common Cause noted the checks were
made out to the NRSC and its affiliates.
   The FEC's general counsel agreed with Common Cause and estimated
the excess contributions totaled $3.2 million. But on a 3-3 vote,
with the three Republican FEC appointees siding with the NRSC, the
commission blocked action on a key portion of the complaint,
reducing the amount of excess contributions to $534,249. The NRSC
paid $20,000 to settle that portion of the case.
   Common Cause challenged the refusal of the FEC to act on the
major portion, arguing the donations were clear violations of the
party spending caps, and Gesell agreed.
   ``The decision of the FEC not to enforce in the circumstances
presented by the record was contrary to the intent of Congress to
limit the participating of national parties in campaign
fund-raising,'' Gesell wrote.

<TEXT>
   A 19-year-old Missouri man has pleaded innocent
to federal charges he broke into the 911 emergency telephone
network for nine states, then published information on its access
to other computer buffs.
   Craig Neidorf, a student at the University of Missouri, was
indicted earlier this month along with Robert Riggs, 20, of
Decatur, Ga.
   Prosecutors said the two used computers to enter the 911 system
of Atlanta-based Bell South, then copied the program that controls
and maintains the system.
   The stolen material was then published in a computer bulletin
board in Lockport, a Chicago suburb, prosecutors said.
   The 911 system operated by Bell South controls emergency calls
to police, fire, ambulance and emergency services in cities in
Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Louisiana,
North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida.
   On Thursday, Neidorf pleaded innocent to charges of violating
the wire fraud act and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986,
and to charges of interstate transportation of stolen goods. If
convicted on all counts, he faces a maximum of 31 years in prison
and a fine of $122,000, said assistant U.S. Attorney Dan Gillogly.
   At Thursday's hearing, assistant U.S. Attorney William Cook was
granted a motion to prevent the 911 program from becoming part of
the public record during the trial, being heard by U.S. District
Judge Nicholas Bua.
   Riggs is to be arraigned Thursday, Cook said. In addition to
charges he violated the wire fraud act and the Computer Fraud and
Abuse Act of 1986, Riggs faces charges of transportation of stolen
property, Cook said.
   At the time of their indictment, acting U.S. Attorney Ira H.
Raphaelson declined to say whether the accused had disrupted any
emergency calls or caused other damage.
   Bua set a trial for April 16.

<TEXT>
   An Arizona businessman charged
with trying to steal a 37-ton meteorite from a small Argentine town
left for home Friday after a judge ordered a 90-day postponement of
his trial.
   ``I've got my passport, and I'm out of here,'' Robert Haag, 33,
of Tucson, said in a telephone interview a few hours before
departure.
   ``I'm supposed to come back in 90 days,'' said Haag, also known
as the Meteorite Man. ``I'd like to come back and clear myself, but
I just don't know. Right now all I want to do is get back to my
business'' of selling meteorites.
   Haag, Tucson photographer Jeffrey Smith, 31, and Miguel
Fernandez, an Argentine, were arrested Jan. 21 when they were
stopped by police near the small town of Gancedo, in Chaco
Province, 620 miles northwest of Buenos Aires.
   The three defendants were charged in the neighboring town of
Charata with the theft of the meteorite, roughly the size of a
small automobile, that police said they found in the back of a
tractor-trailer the men were driving.
   The meteorite, found in the 1960s, reputedly is one of the
world's four largest. Charges against Smith were dropped and he
returned to Tucson.
   The area is rich in meteorites, and several years ago provincial
lawmakers made all meteorites provincial property and forbade their
unauthorized sale.
   Haag was released on $20,000 bond but was forbidden to leave
Argentina.
   Fernandez, unable to post $8,600 bond, remains in custody in
Charata.
   Haag claimed he planned to purchase the meteorite in a deal
arranged by Fernandez with the owner of the land on which the
object had been found.
   But he expressed no regrets Friday over the outcome of the
expedition.
   ``This has been a super adventure,'' he said. ``I met a lot of
people in the Chaco, and at the end all kinds of them were trying
to sell me meteorites.''
   Haag's case was being heard in Charata by Judge Juan Carlos
Clauter. The judge postponed the trial and returned Haag's passport
on Wednesday after Haag said he needed to return home to take care
of business.
   ``I'm losing at least $2,000 a day by being here,'' said Haag,
who claims to do ``half a million dollars of business a year''
selling meteorites to private collectors, schools and museums.
   Haag, known to mineral enthusiasts back home as the Meteorite
Man, said he planned to sell the meteorite he is accused of trying
to steal. ``I could have gotten a million dollars for it,'' he said.
   If convicted, Haag could be sentenced to from 30 days to two
years in jail. If he fails to return when his trial resumes May 13,
he would forfeit his bail.
   Meteorites are common in the Chaco, Haag said, ``because a long
time ago a giant asteroid broke into millions of pieces, showering
the area with fragments, some the size of marbles and basketballs,
others weighing a ton or more.''
   The value of meteorites ``depends on the kind of material they
contain,'' he said. ``Some are fragments of the moon, others are
the heads of comets.''
   ``But I'm through dealing with meteorites in Argentina,'' Haag
added. ``The last thing I want to do is to try to get anything out
of here.''

   A groundbreaking ceremony will be held next
week for a religious center to replace a controversial convent on
the grounds of the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz, the World Jewish
Congress said Friday.
   The official announcement of Monday's dedication ceremony will
be made following a meeting that day between Poland's Prime
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiescki and WJC President Edgar Bronfman.
   The center will be located several hundred yards from the death
camp site, which has been enshrined as a memorial to the hundreds
of thousands of Jews and other victims exterminated by the Nazis.
   French Bishop Gaston Poulain announced Friday a drive to raise
funds among French Catholics for the interfaith center, the WJC
said. Other European churches will also take part in raising money.
   Jews viewed the convent, which houses 14 Carmelite nuns in a
warehouse used by the Nazis to store gas cylinders for the
Auschwitz crematoria, as a sacrilege to the memory of their
brethren.
   In 1987, Catholic leaders reached agreement with the WJC to move
the nuns to a new site near Auschwitz by February 1989.
   But no action was taken until the Vatican intervened last year
after an outcry by the world Jewish community. The new,
non-Communist government of Poland also intervened and the decision
was made to honor the 1987 agreement.
   Jewish leaders have given the new government high marks for its
commitment to fight anti-Semitism in Poland, where only a few
thousand Jews remain from a pre-war community of about 3.5 million.

the Agriculture Department said Friday.
   Marketings of ``fed'' cattle in January totaled 1.63 million

   The placement of new cattle and calves in fattening pens last

second-largest January placement total on record, the report said.
   State feedlot cattle inventories are listed here for the seven
states, which account for about three-fourths of the nation's beef.
The first number is the number of cattle, in thousands, as of Feb.

   Western officials on Friday considered
pleas for cash and credit from five East European countries that
shed Communist rule and now want to embrace free-market economies.
   The representatives of 24 Western nations took no immediate
action on the litany of requests, leaving it up to a meeting in
early June of foreign ministers.
   East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and Romania
are seeking the same sort of Western assistance that was given to
Poland and Hungary, two nations that led the remarkable string of
anti-Communist revolts last year.
   Though taking no concrete action, the Western officials said
they ``confirmed their readiness to coordinate assistance'' to the
five nations.
   ``They expressed their encouragement and their support for the
measures already taken or envisaged by each of these countries,'' a
statement said.
   It said the European Community, which is coordinating Western
assistance, would send fact-finding teams to the countries to get a
first-hand look at their needs.
   Under the aid program, Poland and Hungary have accumulated
commitments to more than $12 billion in loans and guarantees, as
well as emergency food shipments to Poland.
   In their appeals, the other countries emphasized the ills
plaguing their economies, including high inflation and heavy
foreign debts. Some worried that quick economic changes would hurt
living standards and create social tensions.
   They all promised to move toward open political systems and
change their economies from centrally planned systems to the
free-market models practiced in the West.
   Romania, which overthrew dictator Nicolae Ceaucescu, complained
its economy was in ``deep crisis'' and suffered the effects of
``economic megalomania,'' poor investments, a sharp reduction in
agricultural production and an ``inhuman policy toward the people.''
   Bulgaria complained it was burdened by a budget deficit, weighty
foreign debt and an economic structure that favors production of
heavy goods over consumer products.
   Efforts to change the economy, it said, will expose
``individuals to a high economic risk which they might not be able
to bear.''
   Czechoslovakia said, ``There is no unemployment in
Czechoslovakia _ however, a considerable part of the labor force is
tied up in inefficient operations.''
   East Germany, which has seen thousands of its citizens flow into
wealthy West Germany in recent months, said it needed quick reforms
to ``gain our people's confidence in the improvement of their
economic and living conditions and attract (foreign investment.)''
   The countries sent numerous pages of projects they have in mind
for Western assistance, ranging from cleaning up the environment to
upgrading their telecommunications technology.
   Yugoslavia said it would need $2 billion to rebuild its banking
system and revamp its economy.
   The aid effort began when Western leaders in July put the
European Community in charge of fashioning aid packages for Poland
and Hungary.
   The Soviet Union has not been invited to take part in the
program. Its economic woes greatly overshadow those of its
neighbors.
   Nations attending the meeting included the Common Market
countries of Britain, Ireland, Norway, Denmark, Belgium, the
Netherlands, Luxembourg, Germany, France, Spain, Italy and Portugal.
   Also attending were the United States, Canada, Australia,
Turkey, New Zealand, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland, Finland, Austria,
Norway and Iceland.

<HEAD>Eagleburger Says U.S. Aid To Eastern Europe Conditional</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Except for emergency food and medicine, U.S.
aid to countries in Eastern and Central Europe will be conditioned
on their adopting Western-style political and economic systems, a
senior Bush administration official said Friday.
   Specifically, Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger
told an American Chamber of Commerce forum, the countries should
set up rival political parties and market economies with large
private sectors.
   Rejecting the idea of a Marshall Plan for Eastern Europe, he
defended the measured approach of the Bush administration and urged
business executives in the audience not to try to ``make a quick
buck'' in the region but to help build a long-range capitalistic
structure.
   ``First we want progress toward political pluralism, based on
free and fair elections, and an end to the monopoly of the
Communist Party,'' Eagleburger said.
   ``Second, we want progress toward economic reform, based on the
emergence of a market-oriented economy with a substantial private
sector.''
   Eagleburger will get a chance next week to push the U.S. policy
directly with East Europeans. The State Department announced he
would lead a U.S. delegation to Poland, Hungary, Austria and
Yugoslavia Feb. 20-27 to gauge political and economic reform.
   Poland and Hungary are the most advanced of the Warsaw Pact
allies in moving away from Soviet-style political and economic
systems.
   U.S. aid over three years to Poland is $846.5 million, and to
Hungary, $91.5 million.
   Austria is a neutral country with a Western orientation. State
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Eagleburger will meet
there with government leaders to get their appraisal of
developments in the region.
   Yugoslavia, which is not part of the Warsaw Pact, has a moderate
Communist government trying to hold the country together amid
tensions between diverse nationalities.
   Eagleburger said Eastern Europe is emerging from a 40-year time
capsule. But, he said, ``we must not transfer substantial sums, as
Western banks did in the 1970s, before implementation of truly
fundamental market-oriented reforms.''
   Still, Eagleburger added: ``Not all of our assistance will be
conditional. Some of it will be available to countries as they need
it and are able to use it. In this category, I would place
emergency and humanitarian aid, designed to relieve deprivation and
give a new government some breathing room.''

   In the third farewell to viewers by a network
news anchorwoman since October, Kathleen Sullivan of ``CBS This
Morning'' said goodbye Friday and obliquely confirmed that Paula
Zahn will succeed her.
   However, CBS News spokesman Tom Goodman said the network had no
announcement to make on Sullivan's successor. A CBS source said the
announcement of the hiring of Zahn, who has left ABC, is expected
Tuesday.
   In her goodbye to viewers, Sullivan, who had co-anchored the
show with Harry Smith since its premiere in November 1987, appeared
upbeat but near tears.
   ``Paula Zahn has been the stepmother to two of my other children
at ABC, and now I'm sure she'll take great care of my third, `CBS
This Morning,''' she said.
   Before joining CBS, Sullivan co-anchored ABC's ``World News This
Morning'' and the news segments of ``Good Morning America.'' She
was succeeded on those programs by Zahn, who said her farewells on
the latter show Thursday.
   NBC's Jane Pauley, replaced by Deborah Norville in January as
co-host of the ``Today'' show, confirmed that controversial move on
the air Oct. 29, and made her farewell on the show Dec. 29. She
remains at NBC News.
   Zahn's agent, Richard Leibner, has said his client is going to
CBS but said Friday that a few details still must ironed out.
   According to a source close to her contract talks, ABC officials
liked her work but decided not to make a counter-offer to CBS'
offer of a $1.1 million-a-year, four-year contract.
   CBS has said ``CBS Morning News'' co-anchor Faith Daniels will
be next week's temporary co-anchor of ``CBS This Morning.''
   On Friday, Sullivan did not say why she was leaving.
   Her agent, Ron Konecky, has said CBS executives gave no reason
for their decision to replace her, and that he is discussing other
possibilities for her at CBS. Her contract expires in November.
   Sullivan told viewers that she's proud of what her show
accomplished: ``We've restored the credibility that said we meant
business in the morning here at CBS.''
   Her program's predecessor, ``The Morning Show,'' was a frothy,
short-lived entertainment show that CBS tried after years of
generally failing to make a dent in morning ratings with a news
program.
   There were cheers at CBS News when it got the morning time
period back and put in ``CBS This Morning.'' The program, while
getting a larger audience than its predecessor, still is a distant
third in ratings to ``Good Morning America'' and NBC's ``Today.''
   Noting that eight of her 10 years on national television have
been on morning shows, Sullivan said she plans to take a break.
   ``I'm hoping to do some really wild and wonderful things,'' she
said, but didn't elaborate.
   ``So, if I show up on your doorstep because I ran out of gas or
my horse broke down, please don't forget me.''
   Alluding to the 1984 Olympics telecasts she co-anchored while at
ABC, she concluded her farewell by saying, ``Yeah, I'm the one who
wore the sweaters in the Olympics. ... I'm a bit older, but I'm
also a bit wiser.''

<HEAD>US Advises Tourists to Take Care</HEAD>

   The State Department said Friday that most
Philippine cities and tourist destinations are safe for travelers
but urged Americans to avoid certain areas of ``ongoing communist
insurgency and criminal activity'' and to take care at night in
city entertainment districts.
   ``Since at any given time there may be unsettled conditions in
any area of the Philippines, special care should be exercised when
travelling via public conveyances as well as private vehicles,''
the department said.
   ``Except for major urban areas, road travel at night should be
avoided and only national highways and paved roads should be used
...'' it said.
   ``While traffic to and from U.S. government installations flows
normally, people should be aware that (insurgent) threat exists
against U.S. official personnel and facilities,'' the department
said.
   It listed as areas to avoid: Samar Island, Lanao Del Sur (Marawi
City), Sulu Province, Basilan Island, the Province of Kalinga
Apayao and the Cagayan Valley located in Cagayan and Isabela
Provinces.
   Cebu City's entertainment district was named in a December
advisory as a dangerous city area at night. The latest advisory
extended the warning to other cities, asserting that ``due to
criminal activities, travellers should exercise caution in major
cities' entertainment districts at night and should avoid travel to
Cebu Island's remote mountainous areas.''
   ``Special care should be exercised when travelling to various
areas of Luzon, principally Abra, Ifugao, and mountain provinces
including Banaue and Sagada, Quezon Province, Aurora Province,
southern Laguna Province, and all of Luzon south of Lucena City
except for Lagaspi and Naga Cities,'' the department said.
   ``Due to continued crime and insurgency, travel on the island of
Mindanao should be limited to Bukidnon Province and the cities of
Butuan, Cagayan de Oro, Cotabato, Dipolog, Iligan, General Santos,
Pagadian, Dapitan, Gingoog, Surigao City, and the downtown centers
of Davao and Zamboanga Cities. ... Travel to Antique should be
limited to the road between Iloilo and San Jose,'' it added.
   The department said that in the Negros islands, ``Americans are
urged to confine travel to the urban areas of cities served by
regular air service.''

<HEAD>2 Americans, 3 Others Charged with Producing, Distributing Drugs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two Americans and three employees
of a West German chemical plant were charged with making and
selling illegal drugs for distribution in Europe and the United
States, officials said Friday.
   The West Germans work for Imhausen Chemie, the West German
company that was accused in a separate case of helping manufacture
a Libyan plant allegedly intended to produce poisonous gas.
   The five were charged with smuggling and selling millions of
tablets of amphetamines, such as a synthetic drug known as
``Ecstasy,'' said a statement issued by the Offenburg prosecutor's
office.
   All five were in investigative custody. The statement did not
identify the suspects and there was no reply at the prosecutor's
office on Friday.
   The two Americans are a 46-year-old lawyer and a 50-year-old
chemist, the statement said. One of the three Imhausen employees is
a French citizen and two are West Germans.
   West Germany is seeking the extradition of one of the accused
Americans who is in custody in the United States; the other four
are being held in West Germany, the statement said.
   Prosecutors accused Imhausen Chemie of delivering about 1
million tons of chemicals needed to produce amphetamines to illegal
labs in Central America between 1986 and 1988. The two Americans
were charged with smuggling the drugs to the United States.
   At the end of 1987, the Americans allegedly decided to move drug
production to Europe and contacted the three Imhausen employees,
the statement said.
   Until the group's arrest in early 1989, Imhausen Chemie
allegedly supplied 1.3 million amphetamine tablets to the two
Americans. About 400,000 tablets reached the European drug market,
the statement said.
   Imhausen Chemie stood at the center of the scandal involving the
Libyan plant, which shook the Bonn government last year and
strained U.S.-West German relations for several months.
   The United States alleged the plant in Rabta, Libya, was built
to produce chemical weapons. Libya denied the allegations and said
it was a pharmaceutical manufacturing plant.
   Bonn first denied that West German companies were involved in
the project but later acknowledged that West German companies
played a major role in providing the technology for the plant to
Libya.
   Juergen Hippenstiel-Imhausen, the former head of Imhausen
Chemie, was arrested in May and remains in custody in connection
with the case.
   West German officials said last week the Libyan factory has
begun producing limited amounts of poison gas.

   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev is a
power-hungry politician who has an overblown reputation as a
reformer, Soviet dissident Yelena Bonner said Friday at a peace
forum.
   ``Gorbachev has shown himself as a very strong leader in the
struggle for his own power and his own survival,'' the widow of
dissident leader Andrei Sakharov said. ``Is he only interested in
personal power? Or is he interested in the rights of the people?''
   Bonner's remarks opened the Peace Prize Forum at Augsburg
College, a two-day event held in cooperation with the Norwegian
Nobel Institute. Sakharov, recipient of the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize,
had been scheduled to attend the forum but died Dec. 14 of a heart
attack.
   Bonner said Gorbachev's actions have been widely misinterpreted
by the West. She said revolts for democratic change in the Soviet
bloc have been brewing for a long time and Gorbachev deserves
credit only for not stamping them out.
   ``He behaves that way not because he wants them to proclaim
their independence from the Communist Party, but because he could
not stop it,'' Bonner said. ``He had no way of influencing events
in eastern Europe.''
   Despite five years of perestroika _ the political and economic
restructuring sought by Gorbachev _ the Soviet Union is still
wracked by economic woes that have kept 43 million people in
poverty, Bonner said.
   Ethnic battles and civil unrest have been worsened by military
intervention directed by Gorbachev, she said.
   ``The analysis of the Western media stops at, `Poor Gorbachev,
how difficult it must be for him to govern in such
circumstances,''' she said.
   While Gorbachev deserves credit for a progressive foreign
policy, he has not offered solutions to domestic problems, Bonner
said.
   His five-year economic plan is ``not at all different'' from a
long litany of previous five-year plans. The most recent Soviet
Party platform, printed in Pravda earlier this week, also is
unchanged, she said.
   ``Although it does include some new slogans, in its substance it
is not very different from previous communist party platforms,''
Bonner said. ``These thoughts have lost their meaning to the Soviet
people.''
   Bonner, who volunteered for the Soviet army in World War II and
suffered eye damage during battle, began voicing dissent in the
late 1960s when the Red Army invaded Czechoslovakia. After marrying
Sakharov in 1971, she was watched by the KGB and harassed for her
ties to dissident publishers.
   In the mid-1970s, Sakharov was arrested and sent to internal
exile in the city of Gorky after criticizing Soviet military
intervention in Afghanistan. In 1986, Gorbachev personally informed
Sakarov and Bonner that they were free to live and work in Moscow.
   Bonner, 67, opened the forum with a news conference also
attended by former Vice President Walter Mondale. Her remarks were
interpreted by her son, Alexey.
   Bonner and former President Carter were to address the forum
Saturday.

<HEAD>Farmers Develop Conservation Plans for Eroded Croplands</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Farmers have developed conservation plans for
about 134.7 million acres of highly erodible cropland, the
Agriculture Department said Friday.
   That represents more than 96 percent of the approximately 140
million acres of highly erodible cropland targeted for plans,
according to the department's Soil Conservation Service.
   Under 1985 farm law, farmers were to have plans drawn up and
actively applying conservation practices to the land by the end of
last year. The plans must be fully implemented by Dec. 31, 1994, if
they want to remain eligible to USDA farm program benefits.
   Wilson Scaling, chief of the SCS, said conservation plans have
been fully implemented on 27 percent of the eligible cropland.
   Of the highly erodible cropland without plans, about five
million acres were temporarily exempted until soil surveys are
completed, he said. Also, there is some land that is no longer
being used for crops or where the person has decided not to develop
a plan at this time.

   Day six of ``Trump: The Divorce'' arrived Friday
with the billionaire developer saying he had no plans to pay
estranged wife Ivana $100 million in a settlement to end their
marriage.
   ``I don't rule anything out, but it's highly unlikely'' there
will a settlement negotiated beyond an existing prenuptial
agreement, Trump told New York Newsday. The paper had reported a
day earlier that Trump told associates he expected to pay $100
million to end the case quickly.
   ``It's a very simple case. It's an open and shut case,'' Trump
told the newspaper. ``I'll do whatever I have to do, but I don't
see a settlement of this case.''
   Trump's fortune, which includes the Trump Tower, the Trump Plaza
Hotel and Casino, and the Trump Shuttle, is estimated at $1.7
billion. The couple has a divorce agreement which was updated four
times during their nearly 13-year marriage. It reportedly would
give Ivana $25 million, a Connecticut estate and custody of their
three children.
   While Trump was focusing on the divorce itself, media coverage
was touching on everything but the couple's marriage, including
more reports on purported Trump girlfriend Marla Maples. Among the
more interesting items Friday were:
   _ Advice on divorce from Roxanne Pulitzer. ``You can fight over
money and everything ese, but I hope the children are kept from all
this,'' she trumpeted in USA Today.
   _ Word from skater Peggy Fleming, a rumored Trump flame, that
she and Donald are not buddy-buddy. ``I wouldn't even call him a
close friend,'' said the former Olympian.
   _ Columnist Liz Smith's tidbit in the New York Daily News that
Trump's father, Fred, told his son, ``If you don't stop what you're
doing, it's going to give me a stroke!''
   _ A front-page headline in the New York Post proclaiming,
``Marla boasts to her pals about Donald: `Best sex I've ever
had.''' A picture of a smug-looking Trump ran alongside the
headline, with a caption reading, ``We always knew Donald Trump was
a tiger in the corporate board room, but now we know he's a wildcat
in the bedroom, too.''
   This last item produced an angry denial from Miss Maples' agent,
Chuck Jones.
   ``It is an absolute, vicious lie _ L-I-E,'' said Jones. ``She
would never make such a statement to an absolute stranger ... It's
not logical. It's stupidity.''
   Miss Maples turned down the chance to pose for a ``People''
magazine cover because the story was going to focus on the Trump
marriage, Jones said. He also said she turned down a $250,000 offer
to tell her story to the National Enquirer.
   The agent also raised the possibility of legal action stemming
from the stories about his client.
   Jones has repeatedly denied that Miss Maples, who has yet to
comment publicly on the divorce, is involved romantically with
Trump.

<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Angolan government forces said they
killed 175 U.S.-backed rebels last week, and Angolan and Cuban
officials prepared to discuss troop withdrawals, Angola's state
news agency ANGOP reported Friday.
   The rebels, belonging to Jonas Savimbi's National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola, or UNITA, died in fighting in
northern Uige province, central Benguela, Cuanza South, Huambo, Bie
and Moxico, and Cuando Cubango in the southeast between Feb. 7 and
13, ANGOP said.
   Government troops captured five rebels and military hardware,
and liberated 44 civilian prisoners, said the ANGOP report, which
was monitored in Lisbon.
   The agency quoted an army statement as saying 13 UNITA members
surrendered. There was no independent confirmation of the report
and no government casualties were given.
   In a separate report, the agency said Cuban and Angolan
officials would meet Monday to discuss plans for repatriating Cuban
troops under regional peace accords signed by the two countries and
South Africa in December 1988.
   Some 32,500 Cuban soldiers have left Angola under the
agreements, but Havana suspended troop withdrawal last month after
four Cuban soldiers died in a UNITA raid.
   All 50,000 Cubans are scheduled to leave by mid-1991.
   UNITA, backed by a reported $50 million in annual U.S. aid, has
been fighting the Marxist Luanda government since Angola gained
independence from Portugal in 1975.
   Government forces, backed by Soviet arms, launched a major
offensive in southeastern Angola in late December and have been
battling the rebels for control of the strategic Mavinga airstrip.

   It's not often that depositors rush to
help bail out a bank, but local supporters remember the good times
with Connecticut Bank and Trust Co.
   ``Wait a minute,'' said Bill Faude, director of the non-profit
Old State House group. ``This is good old CBT that has always been
there for every civic group, shelter, soup kitchen or fund-raising
drive in this town. They're the ones who drop the first shoe.
They've had a member on every board. They need to know they've got
some friends.''
   Faude walked into the bank on Tuesday with $50,000 of Old State
House funds to put in a certificate of deposit. He also drafted a
letter to the hundreds of other non-profit groups in the area
urging them to show their support.
   Faude came up with the idea last week after hearing of the
financial woes affecting CBT's parent. Last month the Boston-based
Bank of New England announced an anticipated 1989 loss of $1.05
billion due to the slumping real estate market.
   The Boston bank said it was selling $6 billion in assets as part
of its recovery plan. But some municipalities withdrew funds,
prompting the Boston bank to borrow money from the Federal Reserve
to tide it over.
   CBT lost $355 million last year and lost 16 percent of its
deposits during the first five weeks of this year, according to
state banking reports.
   Faude's idea picked up momentum, with checks or promises flowing
in from such groups as the Connecticut Opera, River front
Recapture, the Urban League and the Connecticut Historical Society.
The groups said they'd either deposit new funds or add to current
CBT accounts.
   Sandy Bender, a bank official, said more than 80 percent of the
bank's officers serve in at least one community volunteer position.
The bank provided more than 300 volunteers for the Special Olympics
last year, and collected more than four tons of food for a food
drive.
   She said withdrawals from the bank have stopped, but she was
impressed by the groups' outpouring of support.
   ``It's an extremely gracious and supportive gesture,'' Bender
said.

   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said
Friday he has named Virgil M. Rosendale, a farmer and livestock
industry leader from Augusta, Ill., as head of the Packers and
Stockyards Administration.
   The Agriculture Department agency handles fair-trade regulatory
programs designed to protect consumers and members of the livestock
and poultry industries from unfair, deceptive or monopolistic
business practices.
   Rosendale has managed a 2,000-acre grain and livestock farm. He
is past president of the National Pork Producers Council, former
chairman of the National Livestock Meat Board, and was the first
president of the National Pork Board in 1986-89.
   Yeutter said Rosendale, whose salary will be $81,400 a year,
``brings to the job 30 years experience running a successful
livestock operation, and a wealth of leadership experience within
the livestock industry.''

<HEAD>Barry's Attorney Says Perjury Charges Not `Hardest' to Defend</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reminders of past trial success by Marion
Barry's attorney _ he won the last major perjury case in the
nation's capital _ and Barry's own talk of federal persecution
could signal defense strategy as the Washington mayor fights drug
and perjury charges.
   ``I've tried three perjury cases before and I don't think
perjury charges are the hardest to defend against,'' lawyer R.
Kenneth Mundy told reporters Thursday after Barry was indicted on
three felony perjury counts and five misdemeanor charges of cocaine
possession.
   Mundy reminded reporters that two years ago he persuaded jurors
to acquit the former president of the city's public university of
five perjury charges as well as mail fraud and theft.
   The two cases have parallels that may foreshadow the type of
defense Mundy will offer for the mayor.
   Both Barry and Robert L. Green, the former president of the
University of the District of Columbia, are veterans of the 1960s
civil rights movement in the South.
   As in the Green case, Mundy appears ready to portray Barry as a
scapegoat for white federal prosecutors intent on getting a
conviction at all costs.
   In a statement after the indictment, the mayor himself evoked
the specter of persecution. Barry, undergoing treatment at a drug
and alcoholism clinic in West Palm Beach, Fla., called the
indictment ``a continuation of the political lynching and excesses
of the Justice Department.''
   In the Green case, Coretta Scott King, the widow of slain civil
rights leaders Martin Luther King Jr., appeared as a character
witness, as did Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young, another veteran of the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference.
   In his summation, Mundy recalled Green's career as a civil
rights worker in Alabama and Mississippi, urging jurors to ``search
your hearts'' before judging him guilty or innocent.
   Earlier in the trial, Mundy had challenged the credibility of
Green's chief accuser, who ironically is a top aide to Barry. The
Barry case would seem to call for similar tactics, especially since
a key witness will be a convicted drug dealer, Charles Lewis.
   Lewis says he used cocaine with the mayor on several occasions
at a downtown hotel in late 1988. Barry is charged with lying to a
grand jury when he said he nothing to do with Lewis in relation to
cocaine.
   Four of the possession charges also stem from Barry's visits to
Lewis' hotel room.
   In perjury cases, said Washington criminal lawyer E. Lawrence
Barcella, a former federal prosecutor, ``first of all you have to
establish the fact, then you have to establish the fact that
someone lied about that fact. Here they are going to have a lot of
difficulty establishing the fact.''
   Mundy said that on these Lewis-related charges prosecutors
appear to be relying on testimony rather than physical evidence of
drug possession.
   But Barcella said ``dopeless drug cases'' are not unusual.
``There have been a lot of cases where there has been no white
powder on the table,'' he said in an interview.
   Mundy also is laying the groundwork for a possible entrapment
defense to the fifth cocaine possession charge, which stems from
Barry's Jan. 18 arrest at a downtown hotel.
   Barry came to the hotel to see former girlfriend Rasheeda Moore,
who was cooperating with the FBI.
   While Mundy admitted in a television interview that the FBI
caught the mayor ``red-handed'' using crack cocaine, he also said
that FBI videotapes of the episode show that Ms. Moore, not Barry,
first mentioned the subject of cocaine.
   He also suggested, contrary to an FBI affidavit, that Ms. Moore
lit the pipe from which the mayor smoked the drug.
   The Barry case was assigned Friday to U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson, who presided at the 1987 perjury trial of former
White House aide Michael K. Deaver.
   Jackson, who tentatively scheduled a Feb. 21 arraignment for
Barry, fined Deaver $100,000 and ordered him to perform community
service for lying under oath about his lobbying business.
   Also Friday, Walter Fauntroy, the District of Columbia's
non-voting delegate to Congress, said he was ``agonizing'' over
whether to run for mayor.
   Barry, who was first elected mayor in 1978, has given no public
indication that he will not seek office again, though former
supporters have been slipping away _ some urging Jesse Jackson to
make the race.
   Calls for Barry's resignation also have been increasing _ The
Washington Post said in an editorial Friday that Barry ``has lost
any last claim to a position of leadership'' and should quit _ but
the mayor has said he will not.

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament approved civil marriage among
members of the predominant Greek Orthodox Church on Friday, defying
an excommunication threat by its Holy Synod.
   The decision is expected to lead to a break between the
unicameral 50-member Greek Cypriot Parliament and the church.
   The pre-dawn vote after an overnight debate was 30 in favor, 12
against. The remaining members were absent.
   Deputies said the law was designed to bring Cyprus legislation
in line with that of the European Economic Community and that a
similar law in Greece has existed for years without any objection
from the Greek Orthodox Church.
   Lawmakers accused the church of trying to retain the financial
benefits _ the fees _ it gets from its monopoly on performing
marriages and in divorces.
   The Synod issued a statement earlier calling the deputies'
intention to allow civil marriage a sacrilege.
   The statement said, ``The Holy Synod considers it its duty to
make it clear that the Church will not succumb to the arrogance of
any worldly authority and will not abandon the sane sheep of the
Christian flock at the mercy of wolves.''
   It added that it would fight such a development ``not with
weapons of the flesh, but those of the spirit, sufficiently
powerful to result in excommunication.''
   The Synod also warned that members of the church marrying under
civil law, or attending as best man or bridesmaid at such
ceremonies, would be automatically excommunicated.
   Glafcos Clerides, leader of the largest party, the conservative
Democratic Rally, accused the synod of ``unacceptable interference
in the legislative work of the House and contempt for the
democratically elected representatives of the people.''
   The parliamentary spokesmen of the three other parties,
centrist, Socialist and Communist, branded the Synod statement
variously as anachronistic, undemocratic, arrogant, insulting and
completely unacceptable.

   The city's new public safety director was
briefing reporters, saying it was safe to walk anywhere in the
city, when he was interrupted by a man whose girlfriend had just
been smashed in the face with a brick.
   ``Help me! Help me! She's been hurt!'' James Meleski screamed as
he jumped out of his pickup while his bloodied girlfriend held her
baby inside. ``Five or six guys did it over by the railroad
tracks.''
   Meleski had driven to City Hall for help and stopped right in
front of reporters who were interviewing Reuben Greenberg, the
Charleston, S.C., police chief currently on a six-month contract to
help Mobile lower its crime rate.
   Greenberg sent police on horseback to the crime scene.
   Police said the brick was thrown through the pickup window
shortly after a downtown Mardi Gras parade Thursday night.
   Greenberg said four or five males, probably juveniles, were
described as the assailants. City officials posted a $1,000 reward
Friday.
   The injured woman, Jill Gruendle, 27, of Chickasaw, was listed
in fair condition at the University of South Alabama Medical Center.
   ``I'd like to nail them,'' Greenberg said. ``She has some very,
very serious cuts to the face and probably will have permanent
scarring.''
   ``I want you to see everything there,'' Greenberg told
reporters. ``We're going to catch them ... because you're going to
put it on TV and in the newspaper and people will be so outraged
that they will turn these guys in. We're going to find out who did
it.''
   The six mounted police officers Greenberg sent to the crime
scene are from Charleston and were in Mobile to ride in Mardi Gras
parades.

<HEAD>Partially Burned Body of Kenyan Missing Foreign Minister Found</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The partly burned body of Kenya's foreign
minister was found Friday in a cane field near his home, three days
after he disappeared. The government indicated Robert Ouko had been
murdered.
   President Daniel arap Moi said the body of the 58-year-old
minister was found ``in circumstances which at the moment suggest
foul play,'' about four miles from his family farm in Koru, not far
from Lake Victoria.
   The president's statement said the body was partially burned and
pledged ``that anyone who may be associated with this horrible
event will most certainly be apprehended.''
   Ouko, considered one of the most skilled members of Moi's
Cabinet, vanished Tuesday. His disappearance went unreported until
Thursday evening, when the offical Kenya News Agency broadcast an
appeal from family members urging him to contact them or government
officials.
   Moi said Ouko's death was a loss for ``the whole nation,''
calling him ``a brilliant leader, an articulate and courageous
spokesman of this country and a loyal servant of the people.''
   The minister appeared largely above the fray of Kenyan politics,
his name rarely appearing in almost daily press accounts of
rivalries within the country's single ruling party.
   Ouko was last seen publicly on Saturday, when he addressed a
service club in Kisumu, 220 miles northwest of Nairobi and not far
from his Koru home.
   State-run radio and television stations quoted unidentified
family members Thursday night as saying no one had seen him leave
his farm after he went to bed Monday night.
   The Kenya Times, a Nairobi daily newspaper, reported Friday that
a white car arrived at Ouko's home at about 3 a.m. Tuesday and left
with the minister. The paper attributed its report to two
unidentified household employees.
   Before the discovery of Ouko's body, a senior government
official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: ``People are
wondering how a full minister can disappear.'' He referred to the
fact that the homes of Cabinet ministers are always guarded by
armed policemen. They also use bodyguards when they travel.
   Ouko first served as permanent secretary in the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs in 1963-64. He then held a number of other
high-ranking government jobs before being tapped by Moi to head the
Foreign Ministry in 1979.

   Average residential phone costs dropped nearly
5 percent nationwide in 1989 as declining long-distance prices
continued to offset increases for local phone service, the Federal
Communications Commission said Friday.
   The commission said that based on the Labor Department's
Consumer Price Index, the cost of telephone service for an average
residential subscriber fell 0.3 percent during 1989.
   The CPI showed that local service charges increased 0.6 percent,
while toll charges for in-state calls dropped 2.8 percent and
interstate long-distance charges fell 1.3 percent.
   The FCC noted that the overall inflation rate was 4.6 percent
for 1989.
   ``Thus, in real terms, the cost of telephone service dropped
about 5 percent during the year,'' the FCC said.
   The 0.6 percent increase in local phone service charges was a
sharp change from 1988, when such costs rose an average of 4.5
percent.
   The FCC also released the results of a semi-annual, 95-city
survey of phone costs that showed the average monthly charge for
one-party residential local service with unlimited calling was
$12.28 in October 1989, compared with $12.32 a year earlier.
   When taxes and federal and state subscriber line charges were
added in, the total local service bill averaged $17.54 in October,
compared with $16.57 in October 1988. The total does not include
additional charges for touch-tone service.
   Total local charges for unlimited, private-line service ranged
from $8.14 in Anchorage, Alaska, to $27.03 in Huntington, W.Va.,
the FCC said.
   The federal subscriber line charge, which helps defray the costs
of connecting the local phone system with long-distance circuits,
was $3.50 per month for most residential customers in October 1989.
   As the subscriber line charge goes up, long-distance rates tend
to go down. That is because as long-distance companies pay less for
the connection charge, the FCC requires them to pass the savings
along to long-distance customers.
   The average household spent $499 on phone bills in 1987, the
most recent year for which such statistics are available, the FCC
said. That compared with an average $471 in 1986.

   The murder trial of a man accused of helping
to kill and decapitate his brother's girlfriend was halted Friday
when the brothers got into a fistfight in court.
   The scuffle erupted as Eustaquio Deases was called to testify in
the trial of his brother Ruben, who according to witnesses
described the killing in the style of a rap singer.
   As Eustaquio, 23, was led into the courtroom, he lunged across
the defense table, swinging at Ruben and cursing him. Ruben struck
back, and the men scuffled until they were separated by sheriff's
deputies and defense lawyers.
   The jury was asked to leave, and District Judge M.D. Seiser
called a recess.
   Ruben, who turned 18 Monday, is on trial in Story County
District Court for first-degree murder in the May 28 death of
Jennifer Ann Gardner, 20, who shared an apartment with Eustaquio.
Another brother, Edward Deases, 21, awaits trial on the same charge.
   Eustaquio is in prison on a federal drug charge.
   Another brother, Johnny Deases, testified previously that Edward
and Ruben planned to kill Ms. Gardner because they believed she
stood in the way of Edward's advancement in a drug-dealing business
allegedly run by Eustaquio.
   Earlier Friday, Jack Leinen, a former youth service worker at
the Meyer Hall juvenile detention center in Des Moines, testified
he'd heard Ruben describe the crime, using the style of a rap song.
   ``She thought she was cool, and I was a fool. And now she's
dead, and I'm ahead,'' Leinen recalled the defendant saying.
   The victim's head was found in a roadside ditch south of Ames by
a jogger May 29 and her torso was discovered in a lake north of the
city June 1.
   Glenn Kirkpatrick, a youth services worker at the State Training
School at Eldora, said he overheard Ruben Deases tell another
inmate ``that he had helped kill this gal and helped behead her.''
   Kirkpatrick said he took the statement to be a boast and
conceded in cross examination that tough-guy bragging is common
among youths detained at the school.
   Lynn Balbanz, also a youth service worker at Eldora, said he
overheard Ruben Deases rap to other inmates that his brother had
killed a girl.
   Monica Meister said she was supervising Ruben at a laundry at
the institution when he rapped, ``I knew a girl named Jennifer
Gardner, she was a dancer, she was going to narc my brother off, my
brother did her in and now I'm doing time.''
   ``Narc off'' is an apparent reference to turning in a drug
dealer, lawyers said earlier.
   Johnny Deases, 16, previously testified Ruben choked Ms. Gardner
unconscious with his arms and that Edward strangled her with a belt.

   Farmers and government officials say the
Cartagena drug summit will have no immediate impact on Bolivia's
anti-drug campaign.
   However, the officials are pleased that the United States
recognized a shared responsibility for cocaine trafficking and will
provide more financial support for alternative crops to replace
coca grown by Bolivian farmers.
   ``In the short-term, I don't think the Cartagena summit will
have much impact on fighting cocaine trafficking,'' Information
Minister Manfredo Kempff told The Associated Press. ``In a
medium-term, though, we should be able to count on greater
collaboration from the United States.''
   President Jaime Paz Zamora attended Thursday's summit in
Cartagena, Colombia, along with presidents Bush, Alan Garcia of
Peru and Virgilio Barco of host Colombia.
   In their communique, the presidents noted that persuading Andean
farmers to turn from coca production to legal crops such as coffee
would have ``significant, immediate and long-term economic costs''
on Colombia, Peru and Bolivia.
   Bush said he would request an economic aid package from Congress
for fiscal years 1991-94 to help offset some of these losses, the
communique said.
   ``Some critics say we received no firm monetary commitments,''
Kempff said. ``We went to Cartagena for the United States to
understand our position, to make a firm commitment to fight against
cocaine trafficking and from there intensify the fight with greater
foreign collaboration. Now the effective collaboration must come.''
   Evo Morales, leader of the Chapare region's coca-leaf farmers
union, said the Cartagena summit did not provide concrete programs
to address the needs of farmers.
   ``In the summit declarations there is nothing clear and it does
not assure us markets or prices for alternative crops. We do not
trust the Bolivian or American governments,'' Morales said.
   Pastor Velazquez, leader of the country's farmers confederation,
said ``only general positions were approved'' at the summit. He
said without more funds invested in rural areas, eradicating coca
will remain ``practically paralyzed.''
   Velazquez added that coffee is often mentioned as a possible
alternative crop, but noted even ``Colombia is worried because the
price for that product is so low.''
   Under-Secretary of Justice Roger Pando said the Cartagena
declaration ``backs our position of alternative development and
makes it possible for the United States and Europe to understand
Bolivia's investment requirements to substitute coca leaves.''
   Bolivian farmers destroyed a record 3,038 acres of coca plants
in December and January, and tens of thousands of coca-leaf farmers
left the Chapare, the country's principal coca-leaf producing
region. This was in response to a sharp drop in coca-leaf prices
from the Colombian drug crackdown and increased interdiction by
Bolivian police and U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents.
   In Bolivia, about 93,600 acres are devoted to coca-leaf
cultivation.
   In Peru, however, eradication programs were suspended one year
ago and there is strong sentiment among coca growers, the
government and the general public against forced eradication. The
government of Alan Garcia has linked voluntary eradication to
receiving hundreds of millions of dollars in economic development
aid to provide alternative sources of income for coca-growing
peasants.
   In Bolivia, farmers receive $2,000 U.S. dollars for every
hectare (2.4 acres) of coca destroyed. The U.S. government is
providing about $40 million for fiscal year 1990 for crop
substitution programs. Fifteen million dollars are budgeted this
year for cocaine interdiction program. Additional U.S. funds are
only now beginning to reach Bolivia due to delays in Congress.
Total U.S. aid to Bolivia is about $100 million.
   Cocaine provides the Bolivian economy, the poorest in South
America, with at least $300 million a year. The country's total
legal export earnings are about twice that amount.
   The government says at least $500 million are needed for
alternative development programs to wean farmers from coca-leaf
farming. At least 250,000 farmers live from coca-leaf cultivation
in the Bolivian sub-tropical lowlands.
   ``We will maintain a steady rhythm of eradication that is
acceptable and encourage consuming nations to fulfill their
obligations to help develop alternative crops,'' Kempff said.

<HEAD>Owner Sentenced To Prison For Mauling Death Of Toddler</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The owner of a pit bull dog who fatally
mauled a toddler who wandered within reach of its chain was ordered
Friday to spend three years and eight months in prison.
   Michael Patrick Berry, 39, was convicted in December of
involuntary manslaughter in the death of 2-year-old James Soto and
three lesser charges. A Santa Clara County Superior Court jury
acquitted him of second-degree murder.
   Berry's pit bull, Willy, mauled the child after the child
wandered into Berry's yard, where the dog was tethered to a stake.
Berry claimed during his trial that the toddler's parents shared
the blame for his death because they allowed him to wander near the
dog.
   The victim's father, Arthur, said he and his wife had left the
boy on their back patio while they went shopping at garage sales
and found him being ``torn apart'' when they came home.
   Deputy District Attorney Dale Sanderson acknowledged there was
no evidence of malice or intent to kill but that their case was
based on the theory of implied malice, which allows a murder
conviction for someone whose actions show wanton disregard for
human life.
   Willy, since the attack, has been kept alive as evidence at the
Santa Clara County Humane Society, but eventually will be killed.
   Berry was the first person in the United States to be charged
with murder because of an animal's action, according to the
prosecutor and the Humane Society of the United States.

<TEXT>
   A new automated system for calculating
and collecting duties will be installed to speed up traffic at 22
U.S.-Canada border crossings, officials said Friday.
   The system will give Canadians a quick calculation of the duties
and taxes they owe on goods purchased in the United States,
including an allowance for the daily exchange rate, Otto Jelinek,
minister of revenue, said.
   ``We expect to cut the transaction time in half for Canadians
required to pay duty on goods purchased out of Canada,'' Jelinek
said.
   A large number of Canadians, lured by lower prices on a variety
of goods, have taken to shopping in border areas of the United
States recently. The shopping traffic has been blamed for long
delays at border crossings, particularly on weekends.
   The system will be installed at 22 major crossings, including
the four in the Buffalo and Niagara Falls, N.Y., area, by the end
of April, and will eventually be installed at all Canada Customs
offices, Jelinek said.

<HEAD>Creditors Reschedule One-Fourth of Polish Debt to Aid New
Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seventeen creditor nations agreed Friday to
reschedule nearly one-fourth of Poland's $40 billion foreign debt
and suspend payments on it until March 1991 as a way to help the
hard-pressed new non-Communist government.
   The agreement is the most generous so far by the informal
grouping of creditor nations known as the Paris Club, said
Jean-Claude Trichet, club chairman.
   Trichet said the arrangement, negotiated over two days, reflects
Western support for the government and its radical plans for
adopting a market economy.
   Friday's agreement allows Poland to reschedule $9.4 billion of
its $27 billion debt to Paris Club nations, including $3.4 billion
of arrears.
   The covered debt, which was due March 1, 1991, is to be spread
over 14 years with an eight-year grace period on principal.
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki of Poland sent messages to
creditor governments Feb. 9 asking them to suspend principal and
interest payments for 1989 and 1990 on the entire $40 billion
Poland owes and to consider freezing the debt, or even reducing it.
   Mazowiecki said the debt was the greatest threat to Poland's
dramatic attempt to switch from a centrally controlled economy to a
free-market system.
   After March 1991, Poland will pay only interest on the $9.4
billion for seven years, after which the principal is to be paid
over six years.
   Henryk Wozniakowski deputy government spokesman, said in Warsaw
the agreement will reduce payments to the West by about one-fourth.
Poland had been paying about $1.5 billion a year on annual interest
of $3.7 billion.
   Trichet described the accord as ``exceptional.''
   Janusz Sawicki, head of the Polish delegation, said it was the
best Poland could obtain and should be viewed as a response to the
Mazowiecki's appeal, the Polish news agency PAP reported.
   The Paris Club agreed with Mazowiecki's suggestion that
consultatons be held on the possibility of reducing the debt in
cooperation with the International Monetary Fund, PAP reported.
   Two weeks ago, the IMF approved Poland's economic restructuring
plan, which involves eliminating a huge budget deficit by cutting
subsidies to unprofitable state-run industries and attracting
foreign investment by establishing a convertible currency.
   Elimination of price controls and subsidies created 78 percent
inflation for January alone. The World Bank estimates ending
industrial subsidies will cost 1.7 million jobs in 1990.
   Poland's foreign debt is the largest in Eastern Europe. The
partial payments it was making consumed nearly all its hard
currency earnings, leaving little to rebuild its obsolete industry.
   Most of the debt was accumulated during the 1970s when Edward
Gierek was Communist Party chief. He spent borrowed Western money
on ill-conceived projects, and on consumer goods in an effort to
win public support.

   Thunderstorms produced tornadoes and flooding Friday in the
Southeast, while a new Pacific storm rolled into the West and
dumped as much as 3 feet of snow in northern California's Sierra
Nevada.
   Tornadoes touched down at Carrollton, Ga., injuring 11 people,
and at Irmo, S.C., where no injuries were reported.
   In Chilton County, Ala., a tornado smashed several mobile homes
in the Cooper community near Clanton, and smashed the building of
the volunteer fire department in the Enterprise community, police
said.
   Flooding forced hundreds to evacuate in parts of Georgia,
Tennessee, North Carolina, and Alabama.
   Wind gusted to 63 mph during a thunderstorm at Robins Air Force
Base, Ga.
   A blizzard warning was posted for California's Sierra Nevada
north of Yosemite National Park, and winter storm warnings were
posted across western Nevada, the mountains of northern California
above 1,000 feet and the Sierra Nevada south of Yosemite.
   Snow fell at higher elevations of the northern Sacramento Valley
during the morning. At Incline Village, Nev., on Lake Tahoe,
Diamond Peak spokeswoman Lee Weber said the resort had received 3
feet of new snow by midmorning and had blizzard conditions. Snow
also fell on Oregon, with up to 2 feet in the mountains.
   In Nevada's Reno-Carson City area, the storm closed schools,
snarled traffic and all but closed state and local governments.
Police urged businesses to close early.
   Rain fell at lower elevations of northern California.
   Elsewhere, snow fell across northern Maine, northern Lower
Michigan, Upper Michigan, northern Wisconsin, eastern Minnesota,
northeastern Iowa, western Montana, Idaho, northeastern Washington,
and western wyoming.
   Freezing rain extended over east-central New England.
   Showers and thunderstorms extended from southern Mississippi
across southeastern Alabama, the Florida Panhandle, northwestern
Georgia, western South Carolina, western North Carolina, Virginia,
West Virginia, Delaware, Maryland, and northwestern Pennsylvania.
   Heavier rainfall during the 6 hours up to noon included 2.13
inches at Atlanta; 1.93 inches at Montgomery, Al a.; 1.29 inches at
Anniston, Ala.; and 1.21 inches at Marietta, Ga., the National
Weather Service said.
   Temperatures hit record lows in the Southwest and West,
including 16 at Alamagordo, N.M.; 28 at Bakersfield, Calif.; 3
below zero at Raton, N.M.; and 30 in downtown Sacramento, Calif.
   But in the East, temperatures hit record highs, with 74 at Cape
Hatteras, N.C.; 58 at Mansfield, Ohio, and 77 at Norfolk, Va.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 10
below zero at Cut Bank, Mont., to 85 at Lakeland and Melbourne, Fla.
   Friday's low for the Lower 48 states was 19 below zero at
Gunnison, Colo.

   Progress on a Chinese application to join an
international group aimed at expanding world trade has been slowed
because of questions about China's commitment to economic reforms,
the State Department said Friday.
   It said that a number of members of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (GATT), including the United States, have
expressed concern about measures China has taken ``which restrict
market access and are incompatible with GATT principles.''
   ``We believe these questions need to be adequately addressed
before further action is possible on China's application,'' the
department said in a written response to press questions.
   At the same time, the department said it was looking forward to
the eventual inclusion of Taiwan in GATT's membership because of
the island's importance in the global trading system.
   It added that the United States has maintained a consistent
policy on GATT membership for both China and Taiwan over the years.
   ``We have told both parties that we want eventual access for
both on meaningful terms agreed upon by GATT members,'' it said.

<HEAD>Jewish Groups to Pay for Resettling Soviet Refugees</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Jewish groups concluded an agreement Friday
with the U.S. government to pay for the resettling of up to 8,000
Soviet refugees _ mostly Jews _ in the United States.
   The Council of Jewish Federations and the Hebrew Immigrant Aid
Society will cover the costs of processing and transporting the
refugees and pay for their medical examinations, placement and
initial resettlement for two years after they enter the country.
   The estimated cost is about $30 million.
   Besides Jews, the refugees include Armenians, Evangelical
Christians, Ukrainian Catholics and Ukrainian Orthodox.
   The 8,000 refugees are among the 10,000 that President Bush last
October decided to admit in the current fiscal year if private
funding was obtained. Another 40,000 Jewish refugees from the
Soviet Union are emigrating with U.S. funds.
   Other U.S. programs, including one known as parole, could bring
in up to 30,000 more.
   In the first four months of this fiscal year, which began Oct.
1, 21,000 Soviet Jewish refugees have entered the United States.
Some 20,000 are waiting in Rome and Vienna. They should be admitted
by next summer, and the way-stations will be closed down.
   Processing of refugees is being switched to U.S. offices in the
Soviet Union.
   The Jewish exodus is spurred by a more lenient Soviet emigration
policy and a resurgence of overt anti-Semitism. It far exceeds the
quota and thousands of Jews who might normally come here are going
to Israel instead.

<HEAD>Hostage Sister Arrives in Tunis for Talks With PLO</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Peggy Say, sister of the longest-held
hostage in Lebanon, arrived in this North African capital Friday
hoping to meet with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat.
   Ms. Say said she was on a ``humanitarian pilgrimage'' seeking to
ask Arafat if he ``would use his influence to get us out of this
terrible impasse.''
   Arafat spokesman Torgeman Bassel said he hoped the Palestine
Liberation Organization leader would return to Tunis from Baghdad
in time to meet Ms. Say and her group. Arafat was due to return
late Friday or Saturday, Bassel said.
   Ms. Say is the sister of Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, who was abducted by gunmen
from a Beirut street on March 16, 1985.
   Her group arrived from Strasbourg, France, where Ms. Say
appealed to the European Parliament for help in freeing the
hostages. She has also met with U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez
de Cuellar in New York and Pope John Paul II in Rome.
   The delegation later plans to meet UNESCO Director General
Federico Mayor in Paris, Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Al-Sharaa
in Damascus and Anglican Archbishop Robert Runcie in Canterbury,
England.
   Repeated requests to go to Iran have gone unanswered by
authorities. Radical Shiite Moslem groups claiming to hold some of
the hostages are believed to have ties to Tehran.
   Asked whether she planned to travel to Lebanon, Ms. Say said,
''My family has been through enough without my going through any
foolish risks.''
   In an interview with The Associated Press two years ago, Arafat
adviser Bassam Abu Sharif said the best way to win Anderson's
freedom would be to make an official request asking the PLO to
intervene through its contacts in the Middle East.
   A group describing itself as Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War,
claims to hold Anderson and Terry Waite, Runcie's special envoy in
the Middle East, who disappeared while trying to negotiate the
release of the hostages Jan. 20, 1987.
   Eight Americans, four Britons, two West Germans, two Swiss, an
Italian and an Irishman are being held in Lebanon.
   In Strasbourg, Ms. Say urged the European Parliament to ``hear
their cries for freedom'' and seek the captives' release.
   ``I am their voice because they cannot speak for themselves,''
she told Enrique Baron Crespo, the Parliament's president, and Ken
Coates, chairman of its human rights subcommittee.
   Baron said the Parliament will debate the hostage issue next
month and issue a resolution to governments in the Middle East.
   Some Middle Eastern nations hope for improved relations with the
12-nation European Community, Baron told Ms. Say, saying such help
would come only if they help in efforts to free the captives.
   Ms. Say is accompanied on her tour by Don Mell, an AP
photographer who was with Anderson when he was abducted, and Larry
Heinzerling, a deputy director of The AP, which is financiall and
logistically supporting Ms. Say's efforts in pressing its own
efforts to win Anderson's release.

<HEAD>More Unrest in Volatile Kosovo Province</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Several thousand ethnic Albanians
demonstrated in Kosovo and thousands of pupils stayed out of school
to protest the virtual state of emergency in the violence-ridden
southern province.
   About 1,000 children marched peacefully through Titova
Mitrovica, 30 miles north of Pristina, the provincial capital, with
their hands raised in V signs, local journalists said.
   School attendance in the province was low because most ethnic
Albanian students stayed away in ``a massive boycott of classes,''
the official Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported. Ninety percent
of Kosovo's 1.9 million people are ethnic Albanians.
   Belgrade radio said 1,000 people protested in Podujevo, 20 miles
north of Pristina, demanding an end to the year-old state of
emergency. It said riot police were present, but did not interfere.
   Podujevo was a focus of protests and riots last month in which
at least 26 ethnic Albanians were killed.
   Violence began last year after Serbia, the largest of
Yugoslavia's six republics, made constitutional changes that gave
it almost total control over the poor southern region adjacent to
Albania. Before that, Kosovo was an autonomous province within
Serbia.
   Recent unrest has been directed at the strict security measures
imposed after the violence last year, and against alleged human
rights abuses by authorities.
   ``Forces in Serbia that are interested in perpetuating tension
in Kosovo have succeeded in blocking every attempt to solve
existing problems,'' the Democratic Alliance of Kosovo, a new
independent group, said in a statement Friday.
   Serbian authorities claim the predominantly Moslem ethnic
Albanians harass the Slavic minority in Kosovo, which was the heart
of medieval, Christian Serbia.
   The alliance, which claims more than 200,000 members, is not
officially recognized and authorities have called it a front for
ethnic Albanian ``separatists and terrorists,'' terms often used to
describe the autonomy movement.
   Five people were sentenced Friday to 40 days in jail for
organizing a strike by ethnic Albanians last month in Urosevac, 30
miles south of Pristina, Tanjug reported. A province-wide general
strike was in progress at the time to protest the deaths in January.
   A prosecution witness in the trial of 15 ethnic Albanians
accused of inciting a 10-day strike at the Trepca lead and zinc
mine in Kosovo last year, described them as ``no more to blame than
anyone else,'' Tanjug reported.
   It quoted Ferid Fejka, a mine worker, as telling the court:
``Their demands were the demands of all the strikers.''
   Among the defendants is Azen Vllasi, the popular former
Communist Party chief of Kosovo. They are charged with
``counterrevolutionary activities,'' for which the maximum penalty
is death.

   President Bush and his wife,
Barbara, flew to their oceanfront home Friday for the three-day
Presidents' Day weekend.
   The president landed at Pease Air Force Base across the state
line in New Hampshire in fog as darkness was falling. The weather
forced Bush to drive to Kennebunkport, a 40-minute trip, instead of
making a far quicker helicopter trip.
   The area was covered with snow and the temperature was 27
degrees compared with an unseasonable warm 64 degrees in Washington
when the president left.
   Before his departure, Bush held a Cabinet meeting, had lunch
with Vice President Dan Quayle and conferred with Secretary of
State James A. Baker III.
   The president, who returned late Thursday from the drug summit
in Cartagena, Colombia, laughed at the outset of the Cabinet
meeting when reporters asked if he would talk to them.
   National security adviser Brent Scowcroft told reporters flying
with the president that Bush told Cabinet members, ``We want this
thing to work,'' in reporting on the Cartagena meeting.
   Bush told reporters Thursday he planned to cut back on news
conferences because of reports accusing him of giving misleading
answers. He had two news conferences in Colombia after saying that.
   ``This is a photo opportunity and we've got a lot of business to
do,'' Bush said at the outset of the Cabinet meeting.
   When a reporter asked if he was still upset with the media, Bush
said kiddingly, ``I'm going to get upset if you don't get the hell
out of here.''
   The Bushes planned to see how remodeling work is progressing on
the family home overlooking the Atlantic at Walker's Point in
Kennebunkport. The Bushes decided to remodel some rooms as a gift
to each other on their 45th wedding anniversary last month.
   Only two rooms now can be heated in the winter, a bedroom and a
kitchen.
   Spokesman Steve Hart said the Bushes planned to spend the
weeekend ``privately relaxing,'' with no planned activities and no
guests, before returning to Washington on Monday.

   A couple conceived a child in hopes the
baby's bone marrow cells could save the life of a teen-age daughter
who is dying of cancer, but ethics experts said Friday the decision
is outrageous and troubling.
   Such criticism means little to Abe Ayala and his wife, Mary.
They found out this week that despite one-in-four odds, their
unborn baby girl will be a compatible bone marrow ``stem cell''
donor for their 17-year-old daughter, Anissa, who was diagnosed
with leukemia two years ago.
   ``We've been searching for a donor for almost two years and we
haven't been able to find anybody, so this is the only other
alternative,'' Ayala said in a telephone interview Friday. ``We
can't just stand idly by and do nothing about it and wait for
Anissa to die.''
   The Ayalas live in the Los Angeles suburb of Walnut with Anissa
and a 19-year-old son, Airon. They were told that Anissa has a 70
percent to 80 percent chance of surviving if she receives a
transplant of stem cells _ bone marrow cells that help produce
various blood cells _ but no chance if she doesn't, her father said.
   None of the Alayas have compatible marrow.
   So against the advice of Anissa's doctor and after years of
resisting his wife's wish to have another child, the 45-year-old
Ayala had his vasectomy reversed last year. Mrs. Alaya, 43, is due
to deliver a baby girl in April.
   If not for Anissa's leukemia, ``it's true we would have never
had another baby this late,'' Ayala said.
   ``It is troublesome to say the least,'' medical ethics expert
Philip Boyle said from The Hastings Center think tank in Briarcliff
Manor, N.Y. ``It's outrageous that people would go to this length.''
   ``The ideal reason for having a child is associated with that
child's own welfare _ to bring a child into being and to nurture
it,'' said Alexander Morgan Capron, a professor of law and medicine
at the University of Southern California.
   ``One of the fundamental precepts of ethics ... is that each
person is an end in himself or herself, and is never to be used
solely as a means to another person's ends without the agreement of
the person being used,'' he said.
   The baby can't consent to the transplant, and the parents face a
conflict of interest in making the decision, the experts said.
   The Ayalas' baby ``is not seen as an end in itself, but as a
means to another end. The fact that the other end is laudable
doesn't change that,'' Capron said.
   Anissa said Friday she is ``sort of upset'' by such criticism of
her parents, but ``we're going to love our baby.''
   Mrs. Ayala added, ``Our baby is going to have more love than she
probably can put up with.''
   Leukemia is a cancer of white blood cells. Doctors use high-dose
radiation and chemotherapy to kill diseased bone marrow and blood
cells. Then marrow from a matching donor, usually a sibling, is
injected into the leukemia patient's bones so healthy stem cells
from the marrow can produce healthy blood cells.
   Ayala said his daughter's leukemia is now stable, and doctors
expect she will be alive even if they have to wait until her baby
sister is 6 months old, the youngest age at which marrow can be
transplanted.
   However, Anissa's doctors at City of Hope National Medical
Center in suburban Duarte hope to make the marrow transplant
unnecessary by obtaining stem cells from the baby's umbilical cord
blood at the time of birth, a painless procedure, hospital
spokesman Charles Mathews said.
   The doctors have said the baby faces little risk even if she is
needed to donate marrow. The procedure requires the infant to be
put under general anesthesia to block pain while needles are used
to remove the marrow.
   ``The problem remains: a child will have been created for the
purpose of being a donor,'' Capron said.
   The Ayalas' decision means ``we're willing to treat people like
objects, and I don't think we ought to do that,'' Boyle said.
   He said similar reasoning might be used to justify ``fetus
farming'' so live infants could be used as organ donors, or to
rationalize conceiving fetuses so they can be aborted and their
tissues used for life-saving purposes such as treating Parkinson's
disease patients.
   Mrs. Ayala said she and her husband ``prayed hard'' before
making their decision, and ethics experts should be worrying about
the grave need for more organ and marrow donors rather than
questioning their decision.
   ``There are thousands of people out there who are dying and need
bone marrow transplants,'' she said.

   Israeli aircraft staged a surprise attack on a
southern Lebanese base of the Shiite Moslem group Amal on Friday,
the military command said.
   An Amal source said two Israeli helicopter gunships dropped four
rockets into an empty Amal position but that no casualties were
reported to Amal headquarters in Beirut.
   The Israeli army said the attack was in Al-Hajjah, a village six
miles south of the Lebanese port of Sidon, and a staging point for
joint attacks by Amal and the Palestinian groups.
   The Amal source said the position was near the Shiite town of
Zifta, about 2{ miles southeast of Al-Hajjah.
   The army did not say what type of aircraft took part in the
attack but that all returned safely.
   It was Israel's fourth air raid into Lebanon this year, and army
sources said it came two days after a Palestinian attack in
Israel's self-proclaimed security zone in southern Lebanon. The
last Israeli attack was Jan. 25 against a Palestinian guerrilla
base of the Abu Nidal faction east of Sidon.
   ``Israel has no absolutely no interest in a confrontation with
the Amal movement but if this process continues Israel would not be
able to sit idly and will have to respond,'' an Israeli army
official said.
   The attack on Amal was highly unusual since that movement has
been widely described by Israeli military observers as being at
odds with Israel's fiercest enemies in south Lebanon _ Palestinian
guerrillas and the radical Shiite Hezbollah, or Party of God group.
   However, Israeli army sources said Palestinian groups ``were
assisted by senior Amal commanders'' at least three times in
sending squads to carry out attacks in Israel's ``security zone''
in south Lebanon.
   One was a Jan. 26 incident in which an Israeli army officer was
injured in a mine explosion in south Lebanon and soldiers also came
under light arms fire in a separate attack, said the sources,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a
Syrian-based Palestine Liberation Organization faction led by Nayef
Hawatmeh, claimed responsibility for the shooting.
   The sources cited a Feb. 3 clash in which two guerrillas of the
Palestine Liberation Front, led by terrorist mastermind Abul Abbas
or Mohammed Abbas, were killed in a firefight with Israeli troops
in the security zone. There were no Israeli casualties.
   In addition, Amal assisted in the Democratic Front's
infiltration of the zone Wednesday, the sources said. One guerrilla
was shot and killed by Israeli troops, and Israeli-backed South
Lebanon Army militiamen captured three others.
   The mostly Christian, 2,500-member militia helps Israeli troops
in patrolling the security zone, a 2{-to-12-mile-deep strip,
designed as a buffer against border attacks by Palestinian and
Shiite Moslem guerrillas.
   Israel carved out the zone in June 1985 as it withdrew the bulk
of its troops from Lebanon following a three-year campaign.

<HEAD>Former Soul Singer Sentenced to Four Years in Prison</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Veteran soul singer Ike Turner was
sentenced Friday to four years in prison on cocaine charges, and a
prosecutor said he hopes jail will help the 58-year-old one-time
music star.
   ``Our hope is that when he gets out he'll do something along the
lines of rehabilitation,'' said Deputy District Attorney Ralph
Mayer. ``He's not the type of criminal that's in any way violent or
selling the drugs. He's just a 20-year abuser of the drugs who
should have been caught a long time ago.''
   Turner admitted in 1986 that he had been addicted to cocaine for
15 years.
   Following sentencing by Superior Court Judge Robert Altman,
Turner was handed over to a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy for
delivery to a state prison. Mayer said he didn't know which prison.
   ``It's the first time he's been to state prison,'' said Mayer.
``Four years for a man in his late 50s, he'll be over 60 when he
gets out. I think that's appropriate.''
   Last month, a Superior Court jury convicted the ex-husband of
Grammy winner Tina Turner of two drug misdemeanors, driving under
the influence of cocaine and being under the influence of cocaine.
The panel deadlocked on two felony charges, transportation of
cocaine and possession of cocaine for sale, forcing a mistrial.
Turner then pleaded guilty, avoiding another trial, Mayer said.
   Mayer also consolidated a Los Angeles possession of cocaine case
pending against Turner. A two-year sentence on that charge will run
concurrently.
   The charges stem from an Aug. 19, 1987, arrest by sheriff's
deputies who stopped Turner after the car he was in was seen
traveling erratically in West Hollywood.
   Deputies found crystallized cocaine in a dental floss container
and in a packet of foil.
   A Clarksdale, Miss., native, Turner was a backup rhythm and
blues musician in the early 1950s. He went on to lead his own
group, the Ikettes, before forming the Ike and Tina Turner Review
with his former wife. The latter group, known for all-out,
high-energy performances, had a string of hit records, including
``Proud Mary'' and ``River Deep, Mountain High.''
   In 1976, after nearly 16 years of marriage, the two divorced.

   Rebels said Friday they had overrun three
more government garrisons in southern Sudan and beaten back a
military convoy trying to stage a rescue mission.
   In a clandestine radio broadcast, the Sudan People's Liberation
Army said it captured Kologi in southern Kordofan province on
Wednesday ``after seven days of heavy fighting preceded by a
one-month siege.''
   The broadcast said rebel forces also ambushed a 33-vehicle
convoy, including four tanks, that was trying to reach Kologi and
``forced it to retreat with heavy losses.''
   The rebels also claimed the capture of two smaller garrison
towns, Bazia on Jan. 24 and Amati on Wednesday.
   The report could not be independently confirmed, but if true
would bring to more than 15 the number of garrisons captured by the
rebels the past three months.

   The head of a delegation of Soviet lawmakers
said Friday that his group was satisfied with its access to U.S.
military bases and that the Soviet Union would be more forthcoming
when Americans return the visit.
   Vladimir L. Lapygin, a member of the Supreme Soviet Presidium,
spoke at a news conference after a meeting with the House Armed
Services Committee to discuss ways to assure a smooth transition to
a more peaceful co-existence.
   ``Let's decide about some specific issue to get from words to
deeds,'' Lapygin told committee Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis.
   The 10-member group, on a 12-day tour, has visited military
bases, Los Alamos National Laboratories, NORAD, a Minuteman II
missile site and the Strategic Air Command in Nebraska.
   On Saturday, the group was to visit the Tactical Air Command at
Langley Air Force Base in Virginia and an Army chemical weapon
facility at Fort McClellan, Ala. On Sunday, they planned to vist
the Kennedy Space Center and Walt Disney World in Florida.
   Lapygin said some troop levels must be maintained despite mutual
concerns about how to ease the return of soldiers to civilian life
and convert war industries to peacetime use.
   ``We have to secure peace,'' Lapygin said, speaking through an
interpreter.
   Aspin mentioned some areas of possible cooperation, including
the conversion of industries and precautions against the accidental
launch of missiles.
   ``I think that's a big area, the accidental launch,'' Aspin
said. ``If you have a brand new relationship between the two
countries there's a lot you can do in those areas.''
   Aspin said his committee, which sponsored the trip, struggled
with the Pentagon to give the Soviets as much access as possible.
   When gifts were exchanged, Aspin and other Americans were given
fragments of an SS-20 missile that was destroyed in the presence of
Aspin's delegation during a visit a year ago.
   The Soviets received paperweights with an etching of the Capitol.
   In a jovial exchange, Lapygin volunteered his telephone number
at the Supreme Soviet, saying, ``Call us on the red phone and I'll
find who you need.''

   Gen. Michel Aoun's gunners directed
withering fire at rival militia strongholds Friday in the battle
for Christian supremacy, but some of the shells landed on a
hospital and an orphanage.
   Administrators of the Hotel Dieu hospital, which took 20 direct
hits, and the Notre Dame orphanage said they would have to close if
the shelling continued.
   A tank assault routed Samir Geagea's Lebanese Forces militia
from the Ein Rummaneh district, its main stronghold in east Beirut,
and imperiled Karantina and Ashrafiyeh, the militia's remaining
strongpoints in the city.
   Survivors from the militia garrison in Ein Rummaneh withdrew to
Ashrafiyeh at sundown ``after burning 23 bodies of slain
comrades,'' a police spokesman reported.
   Lebanese Forces headquarters accused Aoun of using incendiary
shells in the ``criminal'' bombardment of Ein Rummaneh and
Ashrafiyeh. The militia has about 6,000 regulars and several
thousand reservists.
   After Ein Rummaneh fell, Geagea said on Christian radio
stations: ``I call the whole world and all Lebanese officials,
especially the legitimate authority, to shoulder their full
responsibilities ... to save Lebanon from this destructive
catastrophe.''
   That may have been an appeal to President Elias Hrawi and Syria
to invervene. Syria has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon under an Arab
League peacekeeping mandate issued in 1976, and Aoun fought a
six-month artillery war with them last year.
   Hrawi was elected by Parliament in November, with Syrian
support, to implement a peace plan negotiated last fall. He
dismissed Aoun as military commander, but the general has refused
to step aside and commands about 19,000 men.
   Lebanon's air force, consisting of four Hawker Hunter
fighter-bombers from World War II, declared allegiance to Hrawi on
Friday. Police said the planes were flown from Halat airbase in
Christian territory to the Kleiaat base in a part of north Lebanon
under Syrian control.
   The police spokesman, whose name cannot be used under standing
rules, said the planes might used against Aoun if Hrawi decided to
intervene with troops from Lebanese army units or military help
from the Syrians.
   A 16-hour Aoun offensive Thursday, using 36 tanks and about 900
soldiers, captured a ring of buildings around Ein Rummaneh. Police
said 20 people were killed and 54 wounded in the attack.
   A total of 98 combatants have been reported killed since the
battle began Jan. 30. As is usual in major battles of Lebanon's
15-year-old civil war, most of the casualties have been civilians.
   By police count, 583 people have been killed and 1,829 wounded
in the struggle for control of the 310-square-mile enclave north
and east of Beirut where 1 million Christians live. It is the worst
intra-Christian fighting of the civil war.
   Police said the main Lebanese Forces clinic was captured
Thursday and the militia arranged with the Shiite Moslem militia
Amal to move wounded from Ein Rummaneh to the Moslem district of
Shiyah, across Beirut's sectarian dividing line,
   Witnesses reported seeing at least two wounded militiamen
carried on stretchers to Shiyah and taken in Amal ambulances to
American University Hospital in Moslem west Beirut, which is
patrolled by Syrian soldiers.
   The hospital is said to be treating 17 wounded members of the
Lebanese Forces, which is the largest Christian militia and has
fought Lebanese Moslems, Syrians and Palestinians throughout the
civil war.
   Hospital spokesman Radwan Mawlawi would not confirm or deny the
presence of Christian militiamen, but staff members confirmed said
some were admitted late Thursday. One staffer said at least four
were in critical condition and operated on.
   Observers said Amal was ``returning a favor'' to the Lebanese
Forces, which helped evacuate and hospitalize trapped Amal fighters
from Shiyah during a battle with Palestinian guerrillas in 1982.
   Alain Tessier, the French director of the Hotel Dieu hospital,
said in a statement that ``every vital facility in the hospital has
been hit. We cannot continue offering serious service.''
   Police said the three-story hospital on the edge of Ashrafiyeh,
which is supported by the French government, took at least 20
direct direct hits from Aoun's 155mm howitzers.
   Gunners shooting at another militia stronghold hit the
mountaintop Notre Dame orphanage in Harissa, north of Beirut. Notre
Dame asked that the orphans be evacuated ``as soon as possible,
because we cannot continue providing them with our services.''

   Britain's Prince Charles took to the
polo field Friday before a crowd swelled by royalty watchers, and
his team won the first of two matches he was scheduled to play for
charity.
   Nearly 2,000 people had tickets for the sold-out event. The
tournament, played under extremely tight security, was the first
scheduled public appearance in the Prince of Wales' week-long visit
to the United States.
   The 40-year-old heir to the British throne arrived in Vero Beach
on Friday afternoon, guarded by British and U.S. security officers.
   Wearing a cream-colored uniform with red letters, the prince
joined the local Windsor Park team for a match with Canada's Maple
Leaf team at the Windsor Park Polo Club, about 10 miles north of
Vero Beach in the community of Orchid.
   Charles didn't score in his team's 11-7 victory. At one point,
he broke the top off his mallet. Justin Fletcher, 18, of Vero
Beach, working at the match, got to keep the mallet when Charles
had it replaced.
   ``I think I'll frame it,'' Fletcher said.
   In Friday's first match, White Birch _ featuring Gonzalo
Piernes, rated by many as the world's top polo player _ defeated
Ponte Vedra 12-10 to advance.
   The prince's team will face White Birch on Sunday.
   The teams are competing for the Prince of Wales Cup, which the
prince's team won 10-7 last year over Greenwich at the Windsor Club.
   Before Sunday's match, the prince is to appear at a $250-a-plate
lunch at the club and watch a display of wild and endangered
animals, including a baby cheetah and an aardvark.
   Charles will address the 550 expected luncheon guests on
wildlife conservation.
   The prince has no public appearances planned Saturday and is
expected to remain at the mansion of friends Geoffrey and Jorie
Kent.
   Forty workers reportedly spent months renovating a wing of the
mansion for the prince, who is traveling without his wife, Diana,
or their children. Balconies were added to the prince's room and on
the third-story observation tower with a vista of the Atlantic
Ocean and Indian River.
   Security surrounding Charles includes dozens of bodyguards,
State Department officials and police officers assigned
round-the-clock.
   Sheriff's Lt. Paul Lekanides said he was assigning 12 to 15
off-duty deputies for round-the-clock security at the polo ground
alone.
   During the polo matches, a special ambulance will be ready
exclusively for the prince, said Indian River County chief
paramedic Jim Judge.
   Sections of the coastal Route A1A will be closed to traffic and
pedestrians, said security coordinator Jerry Burr.
   The prince is to visit the Kennedy Space Center on Monday before
flying to Charleston, S.C., for an international business
conference. His plans call for him to go to Washington where he
will meet with President Bush and discuss environmental issues with
the British ambassador.

   Defense Minister Nicolae Militaru
either quit or was fired Friday after a five-day protest by
officers who demanded he be dismissed for serving the dictatorship
of Nicolae Ceausescu.
   A brief announcement on state television indicated Militaru, who
is 74 and came out of retirement to head the ministry after
Ceausescu's downfall, did not go voluntarily.
   Ceausescu was overthrown Dec. 22 and executed Dec. 25.
   ``The president of the provisional Council of National Unity,
Ion Iliescu, has accepted the request to remove Army Gen. Nicolae
Militaru from the office of minister of national defense,'' the
television reported. Who requested the removal was not clear.
   It said Lt. Gen. Victor Anastase Stancalescu, economy minister
and first deputy defense minister, was appointed to replace him.
   The demand for Militaru's resignation was the first army
challenge to the government it helped create.
   Hundreds of officers had remained outside government
headquarters since Monday, demanding Militaru and Interior Minister
Mihai Chitac be dismissed for links to Ceausescu and alleged action
against demonstrators in Timisoara, the western city where the
December revolution began.
   Most of them left Victory Square early Friday, after the
government promised to investigate their complaints. The
announcement of Militaru's removal indicated they may have been
told of it in advance.
   Other demonstrations took place in Timisoara and the Black Sea
port of Constanta, the officers said.
   In Militaru's defense, the television said he played a special
part in defeating the ``terrorist forces that supported Ceausescu's
dictatorial regime in Romania.''
   But the statement read on TV also cited the officers' complaint
that Militaru stirred discontent in the army.
   ``Some of the measures and methods used by the leadership of the
Ministry of National Defense caused dissatisfaction within the
army, thus contributing to the emergence of a state of tension
which could have been avoided,'' it said.
   Soldiers battled agents of the dreaded Securitate secret police
for several days after the fall of the Communist dictator, who had
been in power 24 years.
   Four Securitate officers went on trial Friday in Bucharest. They
are charged with helping Ceausescu flee by obtaining a helicopter
that took the dictator and his wife, Elena, who was tried and
executed with him, from the capital to Snagov, 20 miles to the
north.
   Late Thursday, the television showed edited film of Vice Premier
Gelu Voican meeting with 58 officers, listening to their complaints
and promising to investigate.
   ``Why allow the army to be destabilized for the sake of one
man?'' a colonel asked. ``After years of living a life of
leisure,'' he said, Militaru ``cannot know (what) reforms are so
drastically needed.''
   A Border Guards officer accused Chitac, the interior minister,
of personal involvement in suppression of protesters in Timisoara.
The army turned against Ceausescu on Dec. 22 and fought the
Securitate.
   Other officers were shown saying many of their fellows who
opposed the revolution still were in uniform.
   One spoke of ``majors who shot into the demonstrators about 7-10
minutes with an automatic rifle.'' Another said the army had been
``killing innocent people,'' and added: ``We were shooting each
other.''
   ``We didn't know for sure on which side each commander was,'' a
captain said. ``What are these compromised people still doing
here?''
   None of the officers was identified by name.
   The broadcast seemed to reflect a pledge by the new broadcasting
chief, Razvan Teodorescu, that state televison would give more time
to independent views.
   Opposition parties have accused the National Salvation Front,
which took power during the revolution, of using official media
against them.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
unquestionably is in control of his country even though opposition
is building, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Friday.
   ``He handled it,'' Baker said on the MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour
about Gorbachev's command of last week's meeting of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party.
   ``I don't think there is any question he is in control,'' Baker
said, adding that Gorbachev strengthened his political hand at the
meeting.
   However, referring to economic problems and strains between
ethnic groups in the Soviet Union, Baker said ``there's no question
but that he is confronted with very, very difficult problems.''
   Baker met with Gorbachev for four hours Feb. 9, two days after
the end of the meeting that voted to end the Communist Party's
monopoly on political power.

   Bjorn Borg and his wife Loredana lost a
$40,000 libel lawsuit Friday against a Swedish gossip weekly that
published an uncomplementary article about Mrs. Berte-Borg.
   The national news agency TT said a civil court acquitted Hant i
Veckan because it did not find the weekly's information legally
``offensive.''
   The article, published shortly before the couple married in
September, insinuated the Italian rock singer was being unfaithful.
   TT said Mrs. Berte-Borg cried during the testimony.
   The article ``is an insult to the love that unites Bjorn and
me,'' she was quoted as telling the court.
   Borg, the former tennis star, is involved in five legal battles,
including a $600,000 libel suit against another Swedish weekly that
published allegations by his former girlfriend, Jannike Bjorling,
that he used cocaine.

<HEAD>Avianca Limits Expenses for Relatives of Crash Victims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Colombia's Avianca Airlines is cutting off
expense money to families of the victims of last month's Boeing 707
crash on Long Island, which killed 73 people.
   The airline paid hotel bills through Thursday for relatives of
the victims, _ 85 of whom survived the Jan. 25 crash and many of
whom are hospitalized on Long Island.
   After that, the airline will advance no more than $2,500 per
passenger ``in order to alleviate any personal hardship sustained
as a result of the hospitalization of the injured passenger,''
according to a Feb. 14 letter from Avianca to the victims'
relatives.
   A copy of the letter was provided by a lawyer for some victims
of Flight 52.
   ``It is the most callous, disgraceful thing I've ever heard of,
especially in view of the fact that they owe them a minimum of
$75,000 under the Warsaw Convention,'' said Kenneth P. Nolan, a
Manhattan lawyer specializing in aviation accidents who represents
10 crash victims.
   The Warsaw Convention limits damages on international flights to
$75,000 per person, unless victims can prove willful misconduct by
the airline, in which case victims can sue for more than $75,000.
   Avianca is ``going to take that $2,500 out of the $75,000, so
all they're doing is advancing them money that is owed to them,''
Nolan said.
   He said he thought Avianca should make the full $75,000
available to crash victims now.
   Seventy-three people died in the crash.
   Avianca also pledged in the letter to ``continue to pay the
medical and hospital expenses of the surviving passengers ... as
well as medically necessary outpatient care,'' and to provide
return transportation to Colombia for immediate family once the
patient is released from the hospital.
   Avianca referred calls for comment to its lawyer, Michael
Holland of Condon &amp; Forsyth in Manhattan. He is out of the country
until Tuesday, and an associate, George Tompkins, did not
immediately return a call for comment.
   Nolan said that among those who will be hurt by the $2,500 limit
on expenses is a woman who traveled to Long Island from Colombia to
be near her 20-year-old daughter, Astrid Ballesteros Lopez, while
she recuperates at Glen Cove Community Hospital.
   The daughter ``has had surgery for a broken ankle, both her
legs, she broke her arm, she fractured her skull, she has her jaw
wired for a fractured jaw, she had some facial reconstruction and
she may have potential brain damage,'' said Nolan, who represents
the woman.
   ``She doesn't speak the language and her mother wants to visit
her every day to help her physically and psychologically,'' he
said. ``Her own doctor says she will be in the hospital for
months.''
   He said his other clients include people who live in the
metropolitan area but whose families need money to live on while
the breadwinner recovers from crash injuries.

   The main opposition coalition will
recognize a victory by the ruling leftist Sandinista Party if next
week's elections are fair, an opposition official said Friday.
   Also Friday, two people were killed 85 miles northeast of
Managua but versions differed as to whether it was an attack by
U.S.-backed Contras on Sandinista supporters or a holdup.
   Antonio Lacayo, campaign manager for the United National
Opposition (UNO), predicted his coalition will win the Feb. 25
election by 15 percent over the Sandinistas.
   But Lacayo, son-in-law of the group's presidential candidate
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, said that in the ``remote chance of a
Sandinista victory'' the coalition would be willing to accept it,
provided international observers declared the elections free and
fair.
   ``If the majority decides the next government should be one of
the Sandinista Front, I believe that we at UNO will respect the
results. Dona Violeta has said so very clearly; this is
democracy,'' he told a news conference.
   Lacayo also dismissed an exchange of threats between the
coalition's vice presidential candidate, Virgilio Godoy, and
President Daniel Ortega, calling them simply ``campaign speeches.''
   Ortega had demanded an explanation of statements Godoy made in
speeches that the coalition was going to ``make the Sandinistas
pay'' after the elections. In campaign speeches, Ortega _ who is
seeking reelection for a six-year term _ returned the threat.
   He said that if his Sandinistas win, they will shut down Mrs.
Chamorro's newspaper, La Prensa, and confiscate her house and that
of Godoy's.
   ``UNO, in its government program ... emphasizes national
reconciliation ... and is completely incompatible with making
anybody pay,'' Lacayo said.
   Ortega said in the town of Boaco that Contra rebels attacked
Sandinista supporters on their way a campaign rally there. ``But
the people, without weapons ... jumped on them and stoned them,''
he said.
   Ortega's was the third version so far of the incident 3 miles
outside Juigalpa at around 7:30 a.m. Friday.
   Carlos Jose Estrada, who said he witnessed the incident, said
two Contras in camouflage uniform and carrying AK-47 rifles stopped
two pickup trucks carrying Sandinistas to the rally.
   He said one passenger, identified as Armengor Espinoza, shot and
killed one Contra; the other Contra returned fire and killed
Espinoza and wounded another passenger.
   But the receptionist at the Camilo Ortega Hospital in Juigalpa,
where all victims were taken, said the attackers were masked
highway robbers, not Contras.
   Defense and Interior ministry spokesmen in Managua said they had
no information on the attack other than what they heard on the
radio, and repeated telephone calls to police in Juigalpa did not
get through.

   A businessman kidnapped nearly three
months ago by the Basque separatist group ETA was released unharmed
in the woods outside town Friday night, the Spanish national radio
said.
   Adolfo Villoslada, owner of a construction company in Pamplona,
capital of the Navarre area bordering the three-province northern
Basque region, was left hooded and tied to a tree, the radio said.
   He managed to untie himself and hitchhiked home.
   ``They have treated me well,'' he said of his captors after the
ordeal that left him tired and pale with a full beard.
   ETA, a Basque-language acronym for homeland and liberty, seeks
independence from Spain for the Basque region. It claimed
responsibility for his kidnapping Nov. 24.
   Witnesses had said Volloslada was abducted by at least two
gunmen, who forced him to drive from his Pamplona apartment
building garage in his own car. The car was later found abandoned
in a nearby town.
   The radio report made no mention of a ransom paid for his
release. A local newspaper, Diario de Navarra, said Wednesday that
Villoslada's family had already paid ETA an undetermined ramson.
   In the past, ETA has extorted money it calls ``revolutionary
taxes'' from Spanish businessmen to finance its violent campaign
for independence.
   Since taking up arms in 1968, ETA has claimed responsibility for
killing more than 600 people, mainly police, military and civil
guard officers, and for numerous bombings and kidnappings.

<HEAD>Paper Reports Plan to Reorganize Polish Radio, Television</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   One-third of the managers and directors of
state radio and television have been replaced and the
pro-Solidarity broadcast chief plans a full reorganization this
spring, a newspaper reported Friday.
   Most of the new management people are former television
journalists and directors who had been out of the field since
martial law was imposed in December 1981 to crack down on
Solidarity, the newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza reported.
   After martial law was declared, journalists were required to
``verify'' their loyalty to the Communist government and many were
forced out.
   Bitterness toward Communist manipulation of the media,
particularly television, to fight the opposition and create
antipathy toward the West fed the public's desire for changes when
the non-Communist government gained power in August.
   After becoming the first non-Communist prime minister in Eastern
Europe, journalist Taduesz Mazowiecki appointed Solidarity
journalist Andrzej Drawicz to run the Radio and Television
Committee.
   Drawicz said there would be no witch hunt but newscasters most
closely associated with the martial law period would be removed.
   The evening television news acquired a new name and look, and
more open and varied programming was added.
   About the public clamor for more changes, Drawics told the
pro-Solidarity newspaper: ``I hope to end this discussion in late
spring.''
   Under a draft proposal, radio and television would be governed
by a supervisory board of four members recommended by Parliament,
four chosen by the prime minister and one from the broadcast
employee council, Gazeta Wyborcza reported.
   There are proposals to make one of the two television channels
commercial and sell some air time to private producers.
   According to the paper, 40 of 124 television managers and all
chiefs of regional television centers have been replaced and
Drawicz recalled all television correspondents posted to countries
of the Soviet bloc.
   Stefan Truszczynski, new head of the Warsaw television center,
worked for a foreign trade company until recently and directed
broadcast activities for Solidarity during negotiations with the
governent in spring 1989, it said.
   Other new managers made films for the Roman Catholic church or
held unrelated jobs, and one spent a year in prison for underground
film work, Gazeta Wyborcza said.

<TEXT>
   Three people were killed and 12
injured early Friday when an overnight express train traveling from
Milan to Paris smashed into the rear of a railway maintenance
train, authorities said.
   Killed were the train engineers, both Swiss, and a 19-year-old
Swiss passenger, son of the passenger train's conductor, Federal
Railways chief Claude Roux told reporters.
   Roux said the ``Galilei'' express had a green light and was
traveling at 75 mph when it hit the maintenance train from behind
in this southwestern Swiss town. The express train, comprised of an
engine and six sleeping cars, derailed.
   Most of the 420 passengers were asleep when the crash occurred
at 1:45 a.m., Roux said. They were mostly French, Italian and
British.
   Two 16-year-old Italian girls were seriously injured. Also
reported injured were six other Italian passengers, three French
and a Turkish railway worker.
   Roux said human error was suspected in the crash because the
maintenance train was not moved off the main track in time. The
engine and two cars were being used to service overhead electrical
wires.
   It was the worst rail wreck in Switzerland since five people
were killed in the head-on crash of a local train with an engine
near Lausanne in 1985.
   Train traffic through lower Valais canton was expected to be
interrupted until Saturday.

<HEAD>Son Of North Korean Leader Hailed as Heir-Apparent on Birthday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Official North Korean media on Friday hailed Kim
Jong Il, the son and assumed successor to aging Communist President
Kim Il Sung, as ``Great Leader,'' a title previously used only for
his father.
   The junior Kim, honored for his 48th birthday Thursday, had
previously been called ``Dear Leader.''
   The official Korean Central News Agency, monitored in Tokyo,
said Minju Chosun, organ of the Supreme People's Assembly and the
Administration Council, called the younger Kim Great Leader in an
article congratulating him on the occasion.
   It said Minju Chosun stressed in a political essay that, ``To
hold Comrade Kim Jong Il in high esteem as the Great Leader is the
highest honor and happiness not only for the Korean people but also
for all the people in the 20th century.''
   Radio Press, a private Japanese agency monitoring communist news
broadcasts, said it was the first time Kim Jong Il was ever
referred to as the Great Leader.
   Instead, it said, North Korean media used to call him the Dear
Leader or the ``Party Center'' since he became a member of the
Politburo and No. 2 in power in the early 1980s.
   North Korea has never publicly acknowledged Kim Jong Il would
succeed his father. But the 77-year-old elder Kim has said ``the
question of inheriting the revolutionary cause has been
satisfactorily solved,'' supporting a widely held belief his son
will take over in the Communist world's first hereditary transfer
of power.
   The elder Kim has ruled the North since the Korean Peninsula was
divided in 1945 at the end of World War II, building a personality
cult and installing family members in positions of power.

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man being investigated in a series of mail
bombings that killed a judge and a lawyer had been involved in
three cases before a federal appeals court that was a target of
some of the bombings, records show.
   Judge Robert S. Vance, who sat on the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Atlanta and who was killed by one of the mail bombs,
presided over oral arguments in one of the appeals, a lawyer said
Friday.
   Walter LeRoy Moody of the Atlanta suburb of Rex is one of three
men known to have been investigated by the FBI in four mail
bombings in the South last year.
   Moody, 55, has previously denied involvement in the mail
bombings. His attorney, Michael Hauptman, declined comment Friday.
   According to court documents and lawyers interviewed Friday,
Moody had dealings with the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
three cases: an appeal of his 1972 conviction for bomb possession,
an appeal in a malicious prosecution lawsuit stemming from his 1983
arrest for attempted murder, and an appeal of the handling of his
mother's will.
   Judge Vance was killed by a bomb sent to his Mountain Brook,
Ala., home Dec. 16. Two days later, Savannah, Ga., attorney Robert
Robinson, who handled some civil-rights cases, was killed by a bomb
mailed to his office.
   Similar bombs were intercepted at the 11th Circuit in Atlanta
and at the Jacksonville, Fla., office of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People.
   A letter sent to a Georgia television station _ which contained
information suggesting its writer had inside knowledge of the
bombings _ claimed responsibility for what appeared to be a
previously unknown white racist group.
   Moody, a literary consultant, filed his first appeal to the 11th
Circuit to contest his conviction in 1972 on a federal
bomb-possession charge. The appeal was rejected by a panel that
didn't include Vance, and Moody served two years in prison.
   Prosecutors contended he planned to use the bomb to extort
$65,000 from an Atlanta auto dealer who had repossessed his car.
The bomb exploded when Moody's wife at the time, Hazel, opened the
package, injuring her.
   Court documents show Moody filed another appeal with the 11th
Circuit in December 1988, contesting the dismissal of a malicious
prosecution and false arrest lawsuit he filed in a 1983 case.
   In that case, Moody was charged in Florida with attempted murder
for allegedly abandoning three divers in the Gulf of Mexico. He had
hired the divers to take photographs of an underwater propulsion
device he planned to market.
   A mistrial was declared when the jury failed to reach a verdict,
and he wasn't retried.
   Moody's malicious prosecution suit was dismissed by a lower
court and the dismissal was upheld by an 11th Circuit panel that
included Vance.
   Moody again appealed the dismissal in August 1989. Vance
presided over a three-judge panel that heard oral arguments in
Miami on Aug. 29, and the case is pending.
   Julius Parker Jr., a Tallahassee, Fla., attorney who represented
Monroe County sheriff's officials, said he didn't recall Moody
being at the hearing.
   In the third case, Moody filed a notice of appeal with the 11th
Circuit on Oct. 31 involving a dispute with his sister and brother
over their mother's will. He is appealing a decision by a U.S.
District Court in Florida.
   William Morrison, attorney for Delores Ann Cummings and Robert
B. Moody, said the Florida court dismissed the case for lack of
jurisdiction.

   The Interstate Commerce Commission voted
unanimously Friday to continue service on the ailing Delaware &amp;
Hudson Railway for another week while a bankruptcy trustee tries to
organize a new plan for the nation's oldest railroad to run itself
under various subsidies
   ``I think we're all of one mind that the service should be
maintained,'' ICC Chairman Edward J. Philbin said at a hearing.
   The ICC voted 4-0, with one commissioner absent, to allow three
railroads to continue to run on D&amp;H tracks: the New York,
Susquehanna &amp; Western, which operates the D&amp;H under earlier ICC
orders; Lackawanna Valley Railroad Corp. and North Shore Railroad
Co.
   In the meantime, the trustee is working out a plan under which
the D&amp;H would be subsidized by the states of New York and
Pennsylvania; two shippers; two Canadian railroads and a third
unidentified railroad, said Charles H. White Jr., counsel for the
D&amp;H trustee.
   ``The whole exercise is for the trustee to run the railroad
himself,'' White said afterwards. ``In other words, for the D&amp;H to
run the D&amp;H.''
   He identified the shippers as General Electric Corp. and
International Paper Co. The two Canadian railroads, Canadian
National and Canadian Pacific, are interested in buying the D&amp;H.
   White estimated the subsidies would amount to $500,000 or more a
month, but when asked for a copy of the agreement, White said there
wasn't one. ``It's up here,'' he said, pointing at his forehead.
   The D&amp;H in June 1988 filed for court protection from its
creditors under the federal bankruptcy laws. The line has debts of
about $100 million.
   D&amp;H, which began in 1824 as a canal company, runs 20 to 25
trains daily. An important connection with Canadian railroads, the
D&amp;H owns 569 miles of track, mostly in New York and Pennsylvania,
has rights to run trains over another 1,012 miles of track of other
railroads. A shutdown would put 672 employees out of work.
   Earlier this month, bankruptcy trustee Francis P. Dicello
recommended that the D&amp;H be sold to Canadian Pacific Ltd., parent
company of the Canadian Pacific, which bid $35 million. But the
sale fell through when Canadian Pacific was unable to secure from
Conrail the rights to run on its tracks from Harrisburg, Pa., to
Hagerstown, Md.
   A competing bid by the Canadian National Railways also fell
apart after the railroad lost its financial backing.
   However, lawyers for both Canadian railroads said Friday their
clients were still interested in buying the Delaware &amp; Hudson.
   ``We very much would like to reach an arrangement with
Conrail,'' said Canadian Pacific lawyer Terrence Hines.

<TEXT>
   The European Community's worst offender of
anti-pollution laws set up a secretariat for environmental affairs
Friday in an attempt to placate criticism from ecologists to clean
up its act.
   The decision to upgrade a lower-ranking Public Works Ministry
directorate general for the environment was seen as an attempt to
show Spain is moving to improve its poor record regarding its
natural resources.
   On Feb. 8, European Community Environment Commissioner Carlo
Ripa di Meana named Spain as the worst offender of environmental
protection legislation within the 12-nation EC.
   Last year, the EC cited Spain for 57 infractions of European
environmental legislation covering pollution of underground and
drinking water, industrial and toxic waste and protection of flora
and fauna.
   Despite the criticism, news reports indicate the Spanish capital
is the front-runner to be home to the headquarters of the EC's new
Environment Agency.
   Spanish ecologists were not placated by the decision of Prime
Minister Felipe Gonzalez's Socialist government because they claim
an entire ministry is necessary to deal with the country's
environmental problems.
   The government named Domingo Ferreiro, 44, to head the new
secretariat in the Public Works Ministry that will coordinate
environmental protection responsibilties, which remain spread
across six different ministries.
   Public Works Minister Javier Saenz de Cosculluela acts as the
country's environment minister at EEC meetings and international
conferences.

   President Bush signed a proclamation
Friday honoring the Lithuanian independence movement and calling
the turmoil in the Soviet Union's Baltic states a remnant of the
Stalin era.
   The United States has never recognized Lithuanian's
incorporation into the Soviet Union.
   ``Lithuania's struggle for liberty, and that of its neighbors in
Estonia and Latvia, served as an inspiration to many who saw the
collapse of old empires as a harbinger of peace and freedom for
Europe,'' Bush said in a statement.
   The proclamation commemorates the Feb. 16, 1918, birth of
Lituanian independence. ``The free Republic of Lithuania prospered
until the tragic events of 1940 _ when Soviet troops invaded and
occupied the country,'' Bush said.
   He proclaimed Friday a day for the United States to observe the
72nd anniversary of that date ``in reaffirmation of their devotion
to the principles of democracy and freedom throughout the world.''
   Bush said the Baltic unrest was ``an unresolved legacy of the
Stalin era.''

<HEAD>Police: VD Test Results on Day-Care Center Owner Are Negative</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Tests show that a day-care center
owner accused of possessing child pornography does not have a
sexually transmitted disease found in three children who attended
his preschool, police said Friday.
   John W. Shaver, who faces felony charges of possessing child
pornography and procuring the sexual performance of a child, is
currently free on $75,000 bond. He was given a venereal test
Wednesday as part of the conditions for his release from jail.
   ``We're trying to determine the source of that infection, and so
far, we have not,'' said police spokesman Ott Cefkin. ``At the time
that they took a sample from Mr. Shaver, that was a few days ago,
it was negative (for the disease).''
   Shaver, 56, was charged last month with possessing child
pornography after authorities discovered 3,200 photos of nude and
semi-nude children at his home. Twenty children from Shaver's
preschool were identified in the photos, police said.
   On Tuesday, police added 24 counts of procuring the sexual
performance of a child. The new charges involve allegedly
pornographic photo montages found in Shaver's home that combine
pictures of preschoolers with nude pictures from magazines.
   None of the charges against Shaver relate to any known physical
contact with children, and police have found no evidence that
children at the center were sexually abused, Cefkin said.
   The court-ordered test of Shaver was made after police
discovered gonorrhea in throat cultures of three children who
attended Shaver's Rainbow Learning Center.
   ``You have to look at everybody that had contact with these
children,'' Cefkin added. ``As far as Mr. Shaver is converned, they
attended his day-care center and this seems to be the only common
link among the three.''
   Shaver's attorney, J. David Bogenschutz, said the negative
result from the Broward County Health Department would help to
exonerate his client.
   ``It means that three children have been found, at least as far
as we know from the testing, to be positive, and my client has been
negative.''
   The three children were treated for the disease. Gonorrhea can
be cured with penicillin or other antibiotics.
   The county's Sexual Assault Treatment Center tested children who
attended the Fort Lauderdale preschool after police said they found
nude photographs of children at Shaver's home. Medical tests on all
the children have not been completed, Cefkin said.
   Cefkin said he did not know of anyone else being tested for
gonorrhea in connection with the police investigation into whether
children at the center were sexually abused.
   About 200 children have attended Shaver's preschool since its
opening in 1985. County officials closed it down this month as the
police investigation widened.
   Shaver operated a day-care center in Hawaii before opening the
Rainbow Learning Center. But Hawaiian officials stripped his state
license amid allegations that he fondled children in his care. No
criminal charges were filed in that case.

<HEAD>Mexican Women's Group Says Drug Fighter Covered Up Police Rapes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Feminist groups Friday called for a
congressional investigation of Mexico's leading anti-narcotics
enforcement officer, saying he protected police from charges that
they committed a series of gang rapes.
   Norma Vasquez, a spokeswoman for the National Network Against
Violence Toward Women, told a news conference that bodyguards of
Assistant Attorney General Javier Coello Trejo had been identified
as suspects since September but were not arrested until January.
   Coello had ``covered up for the criminals, letting them go free,
and they continued to commit more rapes'' until they were arrested,
Ms. Vasquez said.
   A spokesman for the federal Attorney General's office
immediately denied Coello did anything wrong and said the suspects
were arrested when they were identified.
   Coello is in charge of a highly publicized effort by the
government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari to fight drug
trafficking and reduce Mexico's reputation for corruption in law
enforcement.
   Four officers of the Federal Judicial Police, which is under
Coello's command, were arrested last month and are awaiting trial
on charges of gang rape, kidnapping, abuse of authority and robbery.
   The suspects, three of whom served as bodyguards for Coello,
were arrested after 14 women filed complaints in a series of rapes
in southern Mexico City last year.
   The case has embarrassed the attorney general's office and
focused attention on the issue of rape, rarely discussed or
prosecuted in Mexico.
   Juana Santos, a member of the women's group, said the case was a
symbol of raised consciousness about rape.
   ``We are beginning to notice changes. This is an example of
those changes,'' Ms. Santos said.
   Ms. Vasquez said the women's network, an umbrella organization
of 10 feminist groups in the capital, was calling for a
congressional hearing on Coello's actions.
   ``He must explain how this was allowed to go on,'' Vasquez said.
She said the network is in constant contact with the rape victims
and their families, who want to remain anonymous and will not speak
to reporters.
   Arturo Antelmo, a spokesman for the attorney general's office,
said no action was taken against the men until January because
``internally, we did not know who they were.''
   But the weekly magazine Proceso quoted a special prosecutor as
saying the Mexico City prosecutor's office received photographs of
the three bodyguards from Coello's agency in September.
   Rene Gonzalez de la Vega, in charge of the case, was quoted as
saying that in each of the 14 cases, the women were with male
companions when they were kidnapped by men in a police car and
gang-raped. All the cases took place within a half-mile radius in
the southern part of the city.
   Last year 1,500 rapes were reported in Mexico City, but Ms.
Vasquez said they make up only a small percentage of the total
``because it takes a lot of strength'' to go through the legal
process and ``repeatedly re-live the rape experience.''
   Seven of the women who originally filed complaints decided later
not to press charges because of threats, she said.

<HEAD>President Signs State Department Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush signed a $9.8 billion
measure approving funds for the State Department on Friday, but
told Congress he would ignore parts reinforcing sanctions on China
and dictating the conduct of diplomacy.
   Bush in a statement said that the sanctions, as well as a
requirement that sensitive diplomatic contacts, like national
security adviser's mission to Beijing last June, be reported to
Congress, were an infringement on his constitutional prerogatives
as president.
   The legislation authorizes $4.8 billion for the State Department
and related agencies for the current fiscal year and another $5
billion for the year beginning Oct. 1. This year's funds already
have been appropriated.
   The bill repeals 1951 legislation permitting immigration
authorities to bar visitors on the basis of their political
beliefs. The provision has been used to bar a number of world
notables over the years; in the 1980s it kept Canadian naturalist
Farley Mowat out of the United States because of a satirical
comment about shooting at B-52s.
   Bush had vetoed an earlier version of the legislation, primarily
over an amendment by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., that
would have prohibited the administration from seeking third-country
financing of insurgent groups, like the Contras in Nicaragua.
   Congress dropped that proposal from the current legislation, as
U.S. support of the Contras dwindled under a 1988 bipartisan accord
with Congress.
   Bush praised Congress for removing that provision, but said, ``I
regret that the Congress has included several provisoins that raise
constitutional difficulties.''
   The bill sought to write into law a series of sanctions that
Bush imposed on China in the wake of last May's bloody crackdown in
Tiananmen Square.
   They included a ban on military sales to China and restrictions
on exports and foreign aid.
   Bush declared that ``legislatively mandated sanctions represent
an unwise constraint upon the president's ability to conduct
foreign policy.''
   Nonetheless, Bush said he could sign the bill because it gives
him discretion to disregard the sanctions if he finds that doing so
is in the national interest.
   Deputy press secretary Stephen Hart said that the sanctions
imposed by Bush, and reinforced by the legislation, all remain in
effect anyway.
   Bush also balked at another section that would require the State
Department to report secret diplomatic contacts.
   The restriction was an outgrowth of the clandesdine trip to
Beijing last June, shortly after the Tiananmen Square crackdown, by
national security adviser Brent Scowcroft and Deputy Secretary of
State Lawrence Eagleburger.
   Bush put Congress on notice that he would flatly ignore the
requirement, saying it would ``compromise my constitutional
authority over such negotiations.''
   ``Such blanket reporting requirements could be read to comple
the disclosure of sensitive ongoing negotiations,'' Bush said.
   Bush's statements were the latest chapter in a series of
confrontations with Congress over China policy.
   Earlier this year, he won a veto battle with Congress on
legislation that would have extended visas of Chinese students
studying in the United States. The Senate sustained Bush's veto
after he asserted that he was affording similar protection to the
Chinese students by executive order.
   The measure he signed also wold provide $16 million in start-up
funds for ``TV Marti,'' which will broadcast from the United States
into Cuba and be a sister station to the ``Radio Marti'' that has
operated for several years.

   Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney, staring across the Korean frontier at North Korean
soldiers staring back, said Friday that communism remains a ``very
hostile and threatening'' foe in Asia even as it seems to be
dissolving in Europe.
   Cheney slogged through mud and fog to make his way to this
mountain-high outpost along the frontier that bisects Communist
North Korea and the capitalist South, which are technically still
at war under the longest truce in modern military history.
   As the defense secretary used bright yellow binoculars to peer
north across the scrub-covered hills and gullies, a feminine voice
wafted across the chill air _ a North Korean propaganda broadcast
demanding the pullout of U.S. troops.
   In the distance at a small, bunkered North Korean post, two
soldiers could be seen staring back at the American visitors
staring at them from the South Korean barbed-wire observation post.
   ``It's always useful to come back to the Demilitarized Zone,''
Cheney told reporters accompanying him. ``At a time when we are
welcoming changes in Eastern Europe and the erosion of the Soviet
position in the Warsaw Pact, it's important to be reminded that the
United States and the Republic of Korea still face a very hostile
and threatening power in the North.
   ``And it's just as important for us to maintain our
determination to protect freedom and democracy here in Korea and
elsewhere in the world,'' Cheney said.
   The defense secretary had been forced to scrub a scheduled
morning visit to the Panmunjom truce village in the morning due to
the thick fog, but he was able to visit this outpost in the
strategic Chorwon Valley later in the day after the air cleared.
   Cheney was transported several dozen miles northward from Seoul
to the DMZ by Blackhawk helicopter, arriving in the mountainous
Chorwon region, which was one of the main routes taken by the
communist forces during the 1950 invasion.
   In a briefing conducted in English by South Korean Lt. Col.
Chang Gwang-il, Cheney was told that some of the scrub-covered
hills he viewed saw some of the most brutal and lengthy battles of
the 1950-53 Korean War _ Pork Chop Hill, T-Bone Hill, Old Baldy. In
all, the United States lost 34,000 men in battle, another 20,000
from other causes. The South Koreans suffered more than 225,000
deaths, while the North Koreans are thought to have lost 300,000
lives and its Chinese ally another 200,000.
   ``We will never forget we fought here side-by-side,'' the young
colonel told Cheney. ``We're ready to fight!''
   Cheney was joined by several Korean generals in symbolically
ringing a huge bell hung high in a red bell tower perched upon one
of the hilltops. The bell was rung five times to honor the South
Korean 5th Division that guards the region.
   Cheney left South Korea Saturday morning for Hong Kong.
   Earlier in the day, the defense secretary lunched with some of
the 43,000 U.S. troops stationed here that are posted near the
border, and attempted to answer their queries about the
budget-driven cuts in the military, one observer said.
   Cheney asked that no generals be present during his session with
the 12 sergeants major of the 2nd Division.
   Cheney travels Saturday to Hong Kong before traveling on to the
Philippines and Japan as part of a two-week Asian tour of allied
nations that host U.S. forces.
   During his talks with Korean officials on Thursday, Cheney
informed them that the Pentagon wants to cut some 10 percent to 12
percent of its 120,000 troops from South Korean, Japan and the
Philippines over the next three years.
   He also got a pledge from the Korean officials, whose economy
enjoys a trade surplus with the United States, to hike their
financial support for the troops stationed here.
   Since the U.S. government contends it spends $2.4 billion
annually to support the military here, Cheney asked the South
Koreans to at least double their $300 million in funding for the
U.S. military.

<TEXT>
   The son of the Egyptian Consul was arrested along
with seven others for allegedly trafficking the synthetic drug
Ecstasy, authorities said Friday.
   Sherif Elgamrawy, 27, son of Consul Bedair Elgamrawy, was
arrested late Thursday after undercover officer bought about 1,000
tablets of the drug, said Sgt. Bill Kesseler of the Harris County
Organized Crime Narcotics Task Force.
   He was held without bond Friday at the Harris County Jail, said
Kesseler. Elgamrawy was on bond on three other drug charges at the
time of his arrest, authorities said.
   One of those arrested was a 16-year-old girl, who was released
to her parents' custody, Kesseler said. The other seven, including
Elgamrawy, were charged with delivery of a controlled substance.
   Kesseler said the arrests were part of an investigation of
Ecstasy suppliers in the Houston area.
   The younger Elgamrawy was driving a car with diplomatic license
plates Kesseler said, adding he didn't know whether the son would
have diplomatic immunity.
   The elder Elgamrawy didn't immediately return phone calls
seeking comment.
   Ecstasy, which is manufactured as tablets in clandestine labs,
has become more prevalent in the past year as law enforcement
officials have cracked down on cocaine, Kesseler said.
   ``It's really big in the clubs and it's really big with the
teen-agers and lower 20s,'' Kesseler said. ``It's cheaper than
cocaine and (the high) lasts longer.''

   Prime Minister Tadusez Mazowiecki spoke
with Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Friday and urged the Soviet leader to
demand that Poland take part in negotiations on the reunification
of Germany.
   Mazowiecki, reiterating Polish fears that a united Germany would
try to reclaim land ceded to Poland after World War II, also
discussed the issue with East German Prime Minister Hans Modrow.
   Mazowiecki wants Poland to be a part of reunification
negotiations already planned for the two Germanys and four World
War II allies that divided them: the Soviet Union, United States,
France and Britain.
   In Paris, an official source speaking off the record said France
and Britain have discussed the Polish proposal and agreed it should
at least be considered _ although they were unsure what role Poland
should actually have in the negotiations.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, addressing
an election rally late Friday in Halle, East Germany, said that
immediately after the East German balloting March 18, East and West
Germany must declare they have no territorial claims against their
European neighbors after reunification.
   ``This applies especially to Poland,'' he said. But he
apparently made no mention of Poland joining the German unification
talks.
   Mazowiecki spoke for about 25 minutes to Gorbachev, officials
said.
   Later in Moscow, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady
Gerasimov said the six-country formula for the negotiations does
not rule out participation by Poland, ``which suffered most as the
result of German aggression,'' the official news agency PAP
reported.
   Mazowiecki also got a sympathetic ear from Modrow, who agreed
that Poland's borders should be left intact.
   However, Modrow leads the remnants of a Communist system that
was overthrown last year and that likely will be voted out when
East Germans hold their first free elections on March 18.
   The cause for concern among many Poles has been West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who has refused to promise Poland that a
united Germany would not stake a claim to its pre-World War II
borders.
   Modrow, making a one-day visit to Warsaw, gave ``full
understanding'' of Poland's concerns and said his government is
ready to back Poland's demand, government spokeswoman Malgorzata
Niezabitowska said.
   Mazowiecki also summoned U.S. Ambassador John Davis and French
Ambassador Claude Harel to present Poland's demand for ``direct
participation'' in the talks, the state news agency PAP said.
   During a speech to the foreign committees of the two houses of
parliament, Modrow reiterated his government's acceptance of of
Poland's western border, which incorporates 40,000 square miles of
formerly German lands.
   ``The German Democratic Republic understands the will of the
Republic of Poland to uphold its interests whenever the borders and
questions of political security are being discussed,'' he said.
   Mazowiecki, after meeting with Modrow, said the German
unification process has to take into consideration the ``the rights
of German neighbors.''
   ``Poland doesn't have to take part in everything. But it has to
take part in everything that concerns Poland. It has to be
present,'' Mazowiecki said, according to PAP.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa pressed the need for Polish
participation. ``One must not talk about Polish borders without
Poles,'' he said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press.
   Genscher on Thursday had rejected Polish participation in the
talks, saying no Polish territories would be included in the
reunited Germany. The U.S. State Department has also said it sees
no need to admit Poland to the talks.
   Mrs. Niezabitowska said Poland was hoping to win Soviet backing
for its opinion and was launching diplomatic initiatives with the
six countries involved in the reunification talks, announced
Tuesday during a foreign ministers' conference in Ottawa.
   A government spokesman later said Mazowiecki also was drafting a
letter on its demand to the four occupying powers.
   PAP provided no details of Mazowiecki's conversation with
Gorbachev. But the agency reported from Moscow that Gerasimov said
the Soviet government ``approaches with understanding'' Poland's
concerns.

<TEXT>
   A 61-year-old man was arrested for the murder of
a Miami police officer in 1946, thanks to an anonymous tip from a
conscience-stricken witness eight months ago, authorities said
Friday.
   Leroy Strachan, a freight elevator operator, admitted to Miami
detectives in late January that he had shot the officer when he was
17, police said. The victim, Officer John Milledge, was one of
Miami's first black police officers.
   Strachan was arrested Thursday on a first-degree murder warrant,
said Miami Detective George Cadavid.
   ``He knew us,'' said Cadavid. ``He said, `Are you going to
arrest me?' '' and asked to call his attorney in Miami.
   ``He has admitted shooting the policeman and there is other
evidence,'' Cadavid said.
   Strachan refused to waive his right to fight extradition during
a brief arraignment at Manhattan Criminal Court on Friday.
   Strachan's lawyer, Alan Mass, told Judge Bruce Allen the fact
that Florida has capital punishment played a part in Strachan's
decision.
   ``No way if it's within our power that Mr. Strachan is going
back to Florida,'' Mass told reporters.
   The judge ordered Strachan held without bail pending a March 14
hearing.
   Strachan is married and has three grown children, one of them a
state corrections officer.
   Milledge was fatally shot Nov. 1, 1946, while on patrol outside
a football game in Miami's Overton section, after he had chased and
beaten several teen-agers who tried to sneak into the game, Cadavid
said.
   The case was reopened in July 1989, because of a tip from a
woman who had seen a youth with a .22-caliber rifle running from
the shooting scene.
   ``The reason she never came forward was because her husband was
very good friends with the shooter,'' Cadavid said. The woman's
husband died a few years ago ``and her conscience was bothering
her,'' he said.
   Cadavid and his partner came to New York in January and
interviewed Strachan, then returned to Miami to build a case,
locating witnesses.
   Florida doesn't have a statute of limitations on murder.

<HEAD>Huge Tire Fire Outside Hamilton Continues Unabated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fire at the Tyre King Recycling dump in Ontario
continued burning for a fifth day, pouring black smoke into air and
forcing the evacuation of about 600 nearby residents.
   Ontario taxpayers may end up paying an estimated $1 million to
clean the damage caused by the fire in Hagersville, 21 miles
southwest of Hamilton, Environment Minister Jim Bradley said Friday.
   Bradley said the government may take the owner of Tyre King
Recycling to court to force him to pay for cleaning the site, which
contains 12 million to 14 million discarded tires.
   But if the owner, Edward Straza, is unable to pay, taxpayers
will have to foot the bill.
   ``That is a possibility,'' Bradley said. ``But certainly my view
is the person should assume the entire cost, when it comes down to
how much (money) that person has, that's another determinant.''
   Some environmental experts say the fire could burn for months
because millions of old tires are fueling the blaze.
   The hundreds who have been evacuated from around town, home to
2,500 residents, will be eligible for compensation from the
province, but the details must still be worked out, Bradley said.
   Tyre King, Ontario's largest tire dump, was declared an illegal
waste site by ministry officials in December 1985. Since then,
Straza has not applied for a certificate of approval to operate the
site, according to a news report.
   Straza could not be reached for comment.
   Environment Minister Lucien Bouchard, speaking from Ottawa,
rejected an opposition demand that the federal government send
emergency crews to help fight the fire.
   ``This kind of fire cannot be put out now,'' Bouchard said
Friday outside the Commons. ``It's horrible to say, but we don't
know of any existing means to stop the fire immediately.''
   The stench was pervasive Friday as fog and freezing rain kept
the smoke hovering low instead of dissipating in the air.
   Ontario officials said there is no health hazard outside the
2{-mile evacuation area surrounding the fire.
   About 40 firefighters are working each six-hour shift to combat
the blaze, but two water-bomb planes at the site remained grounded.

   A policeman and three others were
injured Friday evening when a fire raged through a high-rise
condominium in the Condado tourist section of San Juan, authorities
said.
   The blaze, brought under control after 90 minutes, caused no
fatalities in the 10-story structure.
   The New Year's Eve fire at the nearby Hotel Dupont Plaza on Dec.
31, 1986, left 97 people dead and 140 injured in San Juan's tourist
center.
   Firefighters said the blaze was believed to have started on the
eighth-floor apartment in the condominium, but further
investigation was needed.
   The firefighters' chief, Jorge Collazo, said all the condominium
residents were safely evacuated though he had no exact numbers.
   The policeman, Luis Rodriguez, suffered an injured shoulder when
he fell on the third-floor stairwell while trying to help in the
evacuation, Collazo said.
   Collazo also said an elderly woman suffered slight injuries from
smoke inhalation and that two other people were taken to
Presbyterian Hospital with undisclosed injuries.

   The longtime live-in companion of Harold Ballard,
owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs, has lost her bid to take control
of the guardianship of the ailing professional hockey magnate.
   A judge who had declared Ballard, 86, mentally incompetent this
week ruled Friday that four guardians recommended by his daughter
look after the personal and financial affairs of the
multimillionaire.
   ``I am now certain with the orders made he will be able to live
in dignity and peace for as long as he needs help,'' said his
daughter, Mary Elizabeth Flynn.
   Yolanda Ballard, 57, who lived with Harold for most of the 1980s
and took his last name although they never married, lost in the
latest battle she waged in the courts with his children.
   District Court Judge Donna Haley appointed former Supreme Court
of Canada Justice Willard Estey of Toronto to look after the
personal affairs of the owner of the Maple Leafs and their home,
Maple Leaf Gardens.
   Named to look after Ballard's business affairs were Gardens
directors Steve Stavro and Donald Giffen, and Donald Crump, who
recently resigned as Gardens secretary-treasurer to become
commissioner of the Canadian Football League.
   ``It should have been quite clear to Yolanda Ballard that she
couldn't be a committee (guardian) of the person _ that it had to
be someone independent of Mr. Ballard's estate and his person,''
Haley said in announcing her ruling.
   ``There is also no evidence before me of her personal
capabilities of managing an estate as complex as Mr. Ballard's.''
   Haley acknowledged Yolanda's contribution to Ballard's health
care but did not grant her free access to the octogenarian, who has
been in a Miami hospital for more than a month with kidney and
heart problems.
   ``Yolanda should be allowed to express her concerns and her
opinions as to Mr. Ballard's personal needs and have all access to
Mr. Ballard as the committees (guardians) see fit.''
   Yolanda, who remained stoic as the judge read her decision
following three days of hearings, refused to say whether she would
appeal. She did, however, make derogatory remarks about the Ballard
children, with whom she has openly feuded for years.
   She called Ballard's sons Bill Ballard ``Cyclops William'' and
Flynn ``Medusa Mary.''
   ``At the eleventh hour, everyone comes to jump on Harold's
coffin when he's not even in it yet,'' she said angrily, referring
to Ballard's children. Son Harold Jr. was also involved in the
court action initiated by his sister.
   An emotional Flynn said in her statement following the
proceedings she was confident Estey would make sure her father got
the best care possible.
   Ballard checked into hospital while vacationing with Yolanda in
the Cayman Islands last month and was later transferred to Miami
Baptist Hospital suffering from kidney failure. He requires
dialysis three times a week and was listed Friday in satisfactory
condition.
   Yolanda's visits to the Miami hospital were restricted after she
was discovered trying to force-feed him a banana and Jell-O.
   A Florida court had appointed a guardian to handle Ballard's
affairs until he was well enough to return to Toronto. The four
named Friday now take over that task.
   Haley also ruled Yolanda should receive $2,500 from Ballard to
cover her court costs.
   Since Ballard's illness, Maple Leaf Gardens has been run by the
board of directors.

<HEAD>Finance Minister Resigns, Social Democrats Seek to Form New Gov't</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's finance minister quit
Friday after Parliament rejected his proposed inflation-fighting
plan.
   The departure of Kjell-Olof Feldt from the day-old caretaker
government appeared to be an attempt by Prime Minister Ingvar
Carlsson's long-governing Social Democrats to regroup, regain
public confidence and build political support to form a new
governing coalition.
   Carlsson's government, which is to stay on until a new
government can be formed, announced that Feldt's deputy, Odd
Engstrom, will fill the post.
   The prime minister resigned Thursday, shortly after his
government lost a vote 190-153 on its bill to freeze prices, wages,
rents, local taxes and corporate dividends for two years. The
package was aimed at bringing inflation under control and stifling
a wave of labor unrest.
   Feldt told a news conference he did not have the political
backing or the personal will to scrap his program and start over.
   ``With the plans I have had, I don't have the strength to begin
afresh. To have a new policy, I have to hand over to younger and
better forces,'' he said with Carlsson at his side.
   Asked if the Social Democrats had an effective alternative to
the wage-price freeze, he said: ``No, not today.''
   In a separate development, the bank employees' union and the
bankers' association annnounced an end to a three-week labor
dispute, which had helped prompt the government to draw up its
politically fatal crisis program.
   The two sides accepted a mediation offer of 13{ percent wage
increase, and the banks said they would reopen Monday.
   The speaker of Parliament, Thage G. Peterson, met Thursday night
with opposition leaders on forming a government. But the
center-right parties admitted they had no chance without new
elections.
   Political analysts predicted the Social Democrats would be able
to reconstitute their government without going into elections by
gaining support from the small Communist Party. The Communists had
objected to many of Feldt's policies.
   Feldt was the architect of Sweden's recovery in 1982 from a deep
recession, and won international recognition for measures that
sought to adapt Sweden's socialist ideology with the free market
policies of the industrialized West.
   Feldt's moves toward deregulating Swedish banking and revamping
its tax system won praise from the business community and
non-socialist opposition parties.
   His ideas on privatizing some public services were too radical
for traditional socialists and set him on a collision course with
his own party.
   Feldt credited himself with starting a process of rethinking in
his party, though he said ``not all of my ideas were politically
mature.''
   Except for six years from 1976, the Social Democrats have
governed Sweden since 1932. Since returning to office it has ruled
as a minority government.
   Opinion polls published before the political uproar began gave
the Social Democrats their worst showing in more than 45 years,
with a 34 percent approval rating.
   But the three centrist parties, which governed in coalition from
1976 to 1982, also would not gain a majority in a new election, the
polls predicted.

<HEAD>Exxon to Pay $660,000 for Environmental Study of Waterway</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TRENTON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exxon Corp. will pay the estimated $660,000
cost of assessing environmental damage from last month's oil spill
in a waterway next to the Atlantic, New Jersey and New York
officials said Friday.
   Also Friday, Exxon workers held a rally in Cranford, N.J., to
support their embattled employer. The company has been widely
criticized both for the local spill and a nearly 11-million-gallon
leak caused by the grounding of the tanker Exxon Valdez in Alaska
last year.
   In a joint announcement, New Jersey Gov. Jim Florio and New York
Gov. Mario Cuomo said state and federal agencies and Exxon had
reached agreement on a preliminary study of damage from the
567,000-gallon East Coast spill Jan. 1 and 2.
   The oil spewed from a ruptured pipeline into the Arthur Kill, a
narrow waterway between New Jersey and the New York City borough of
Staten Island.
   ``Exxon must accept full responsibility for this threat to our
waters, wetlands and coastline, and it is only fair that they
provide immediate funding to fully determine the damage caused by
the oil spill,'' Florio said.
   Officials have criticized Exxon for what they say was a slow
response to spill warning signs, and accused the company of
understating the size of the spill in reports to the Coast Guard.
   But at the employees' rally, about 100 current and former Exxon
workers and their families met at a restaurant to hear speeches
criticizing what they called ``Exxon bashing.''
   ``We're here to stand up and be counted to stop this constant
lashing of Exxon,'' said Connie Conselyea, a tank car coordinator
who has worked for Exxon 17 years. ``Accidents do happen and we do
our best to clean them up. I'm proud to say I'm an employee of
Exxon.''
   Exxon spokesman Doug Walt said the rally was organized by the
employees.
   About two dozen members of the Concerned Citizens of Linden
picketed outside the restaurant as the Exxon employees entered,
criticizing the company's environmental record.
   ``It's such a long, bad environmental track record that the
employees should ... be as indignant as we are,'' said Beatrice
Bernzott, Concerned Citizens president. ``We feel sorry for them.
We know they're concerned about their jobs. But their indignation
should be directed at their CEOs and Exxon management.''

   Former President Reagan, known as the great
communicator, went before cameras in a new role Friday _ explaining
during secret court testimony what he knew about the Iran-Contra
affair.
   Reagan smiled and waved but didn't speak to reporters as he
entered the federal courthouse Friday morning to give a videotaped
deposition in the trial of his former national security adviser,
John Poindexter.
   ``I think he was very fair in his testimony,'' Poindexter
attorney Richard Beckler said of the president afterward.
   Poindexter goes on trial March 5 on charges of concealing from
Congress Oliver North's assistance to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels
and lying about a 1985 shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran.
   Poindexter entered the courtroom a few minutes before Reagan,
flanked by a half-dozen lawyers and legal aides, who had in tow a
red cart with boxes of documents.
   The two exited separately about 6{ hours later, again ignoring
shouted questions from the crush of reporters waiting outside.
   U.S. District Judge Harold Greene told reporters Reagan would be
questioned again Saturday. The former chief executive was to return
to court at 9:45 a.m. on the beginning of the Presidents Day
holiday weekend.
   ``It's hard to tell, but we'll be finished by lunch,'' Greene
said when asked how many more questions Reagan had to answer.
   The public was barred from attending the session, during which
Reagan was to answer 154 questions in addition to follow-ups that
focus on his meetings with Poindexter. Then Reagan faced
cross-examination by Iran-Contra prosecutors.
   Greene allowed Reagan to give videotaped testimony at the
federal courthouse near his Bel-Air area home rather than require
him to appear in person at the Poindexter trial in Washington.
   Three cameras were positioned to record the testimony _ one
pointed at Reagan, one pointed at the judge and the other directed
at lawyers questioning the former chief executive.
   On Thursday, Greene rejected a request by news organizations
that they be allowed to attend the deposition. However, he said he
would order the videotape released within a few days, after editing
to remove material deemed to touch on classified national security
matters.
   Three years ago, Reagan portrayed himself as a president who was
kept in the dark by his aides. But Poindexter contends he kept his
former boss fully informed about all aspects of the affair _ with
the apparent exception of the diversion of Iran arms sale money to
the Contras _ and that Reagan authorized his activities.
   Reagan said early in 1987 that he hadn't known about ``secret
bank accounts and diverted funds,'' two products of the Iran-Contra
affair that he said he found ``personally distasteful.'' He told
the Tower Commission he didn't know the National Security Council
staff was assisting the Contras after Congress ordered a halt.
   Poindexter subsequently told Congress he believed Reagan
understood that ``Col. North was instrumental in keeping the
Contras supported without maybe understanding the details of
exactly what he was doing.''
   Friday's questioning, according to court papers, was to concern:
   _The president's knowledge of North's relationship with various
individuals in the Contra operation and the Iran initiative.
   _Whether Poindexter told Reagan of the status of Richard Secord,
who North enlisted to move supplies to the Nicaraguan rebels and
who operated the network of offshore accounts known as the
Enterprise to move money in the Iran-Contra affair.
   _Reagan's discussions with Poindexter regarding a chronology on
a November 1985 Hawk shipment that forms the basis of four of the
five criminal charges against Poindexter.
   _Whether Reagan advised Poindexter to tell congressional
committees they already had been given information about whether
North was secretly assisting the Contras. The earlier responses
were denials that North was raising money and providing military
advice to the Contras. They led to former national security adviser
Robert McFarlane's guilty plea to criminal charges of withholding
information from Congress.

   Manuel Noriega on Friday received his first prison
visit from the Red Cross since the U.S. government agreed to treat
the deposed Panamanian leader as a prisoner of war.
   A doctor and a delegate from the International Committee of the
Red Cross sought to ensure Noriega's treatment was in keeping with
the Geneva Convention, said Jean-Marc Bornet, the organization's
chief delegate for Latin America.
   Meanwhile, an attorney for Noreiga filed a motion in federal
court asking for the results of wiretaps he claimed were made by
U.S. invasion troops while Noriega was being held in the Vatican
embassy in Panama.
   ``We have received information that while the general was in the
Papal Nunciature, the U.S. Army tapped the telephone, and recorded
all the conversations,'' said the attorney, Frank Rubino. The
defense wants to determine if the tapes will help Noriega's case,
possibly by showing he was falsely induced to surrender to U.S.
authorities.
   Noriega was flown to the United States on Jan. 4 to face
drug-trafficking charges. He was first housed at the federal
courthouse, but was later moved to a special cell at the federal
Metropolitan Correctional Center south of Miami.
   Noriega's defense team had demanded that he be treated as a POW,
saying U.S. civilian courts had no jurisdiction over him.
   The government agreed to the POW treatment, but said he could
still be prosecuted on the drug trafficking charges. U.S. District
Judge William Hoeveler concurred last week, and ordered the legal
proceedings to continue.
   The Geneva Conventions are a series of treaties establishing the
treatment of combatants, civilians and prisoners of war.
   Late Friday, sources close to the case who spoke on condition of
anonymity told The Associated Press that Rubino and fellow Noriega
attorney Steven Kollin are scheduled to fly to Geneva Saturday
night to discuss Noriega's status as a prisoner of war with
high-ranking Red Cross officials.
   Kollin said he would ``neither affirm nor deny'' that the two
lawyers are going to the Swiss capitol when asked by the AP about
the trip and its purpose.
   The details of Friday's prison inspection are confidential, but
generally the procedure follows a pattern, Bornet said.
   ``This first visit is a very traditional task,'' Bornet said.
``We first of all have a discussion with the manager of the camp or
prison. Then we visit all places of detention, we see the
facilities, the cells, the kitchen.''
   After the tour and the talks with prison officials, the Red
Cross meets with the prisoner, Bornet said.
   ``We have private talks, and it is very important that they be
without witnesses,'' he said. ``We speak only about the conditions
of detention. It may be about food, about being allowed to go out,
or to have contact with families, or about medical treatment.''
   There will be follow-up visits to Noriega, but there are no set
intervals, and timing will depend on conditions at the prison,
Bornet said.
   Making the inspection were Erwin Boehi, regional delegate for
the Red Cross, and Dr. Jacques Stroun of the agency's medical
division in Geneva, Switzerland. They refused to comment when they
left the prison late Friday afternoon.
   They also were to visit three other Panamanian prisoners at the
jail, including Noriega co-defendant Luis del Cid, allegedly once a
top aide to the deposed leader. The Red Cross refused to identify
the other two prisoners.
   After the inspection, the team reports to the Red Cross and to
the U.S. government. That report is confidential, said American Red
Cross spokeswoman Ann Stingle in Washington.
   If there is a dispute over prison conditions, Bornet said, the
agency tries to work it out amicably with the host government.
   Charles Davis, spokesman for federal prison, confirmed the Red
Cross visit but said he could not release any information on the
delegates' activities.
   Bornet said Noriega's attorneys have contacted the agency about
the Geneva Convention, but the visit was routine under an agreement
the Red Cross reached with the U.S. government immediately after
the Dec. 20 invasion of Panama.

   Guerrillas holding two U.S. citizens
demanded the formation of a committee to negotiate terms for their
release, a television news program reported Friday night.
   Police said they had no word on a third American, a priest who
was also kidnapped by guerrillas protesting President Bush's
Thursday visit to Colombia for a drug summit. Parishioners prayed
for the return of the New York priest.
   The TV program 24 Hours said relatives of James Donnelly were
contacted by the abductors, who demanded formation of a committee
to negotiate the terms to release Donnelly and David Kent.
   The abductors did not provide details on the conditions they
would put forward during such talks, the report said. It also was
not clear who the abductors wanted on the committee.
   Donnelly, a 65-year-old mechanical engineer from Detroit, and
Kent, a 40-year-old school teacher from Indianapolis, were
separately kidnapped in the northwestern city of Medellin on
Tuesday.
   The pro-Castro National Liberation Front made public Friday
night a communique claiming responsibility for their abductions.
   Officials had already blamed the group for the kidnappings of
Donnelly, Kent and the priest, Rev. Francisco Amico Ferrari, who
was abducted early Thursday.
   The guerrillas said the summit Thursday in the Colombian resort
city of Cartagena between President Bush and the presidents of
Colombia, Peru and Bolivia, was part of a military design for ``the
military control of our (Colombian) territory.''
   The summit approved a joint fight by the four nations against
drug trafficking.
   A police spokesman contacted in Medellin by telephone said the
police knew nothing of the guerrillas' demands.
   In the southeastern city of Cali, a San Basilian priests'
community said it has no news on Amico, and a police spokesman from
Medellin said there were ``no leads at all.''
   A ``praying day'' was held in the Our Lady of the Assumption
parish in Cali for Amico, who has run the parish since coming to
Colombia in 1987.
   Amico was abducted by armed men while heading to a nearby church
to celebrate Mass. Witnesses said the group forced him into a jeep
that sped away. Amico, from Rochester N.Y., is the founder of the
Basilian Priests' branch in the San Andres zone, one of Cali's
poorest neighborhoods.
   ``Nobody has contacted us. We only pray for our superior and
Masses and processions are being held in the parish,'' said Rafael
Lopera, a Colombian member of the Basilian community in Cali.
   He said similar prayer sessions were held in Toronto at the
Basilians' headquarters.
   Roman Catholic Church bishops in Cali issued a statement calling
for the abductors to release Amico. The bishops also condemned
guerrilla bomb attacks Thursday at two Mormon temples run by
American pastors. Damages were estimated at $12,000, but no
injuries were reported.
   Medellin and Cali are homes to the murderous drug cartels named
after them. Both cartels are blamed for over 80 percent of the
cocaine entering the United States.

   Fed up with months of overcrowding in
the county jail, a sheriff on Friday commandeered a National Guard
armory as a temporary prison.
   Hampden County Sheriff Michael Ashe said he took the action ``to
prevent the collapse of the criminal justice system in this county
due to lack of correctional facilities.''
   ``It appears ... there is an imminent danger of a breach of the
peace due to insufficient prison space in this county, and that
reasonable and prudent steps must be taken in order to preserve the
peace and quell such danger,'' Ashe said in a directive to the
brigadier commander of the Massachusetts Army National Guard Armory
here.
   The dramatic announcement at 2 p.m. _ and the transfer of 15
prisoners to the armory _ caught state officials by surprise.
   State Secretary of Public Safety Charles V. Barry issued a
statement saying that Ashe had been notified it was illegal to put
prisoners in the armory. He was ordered to have them removed or
face prosecution for criminal trespass.
   ``This is no way to do business,'' Barry's statement said. ``If
you would come to us to discuss the problem, we would see what we
could do to accommodate you.''
   Barry didn't plan any immediate action, saying he would ``pursue
necessary legal action Tuesday to terminate the unlawful occupation
of the armory.''
   The secretary noted that the armory isn't up to code for the
purpose of housing prisoners and Ashe would be responsible for
their safety.
   Ashe said in a statement that he believed he acted correctly.
   ``This action is within my inherent power to keep the peace. I
take full responsibility for this action to protect my fellow
citizens,'' he said.
   Seventeen minimum security prisoners were taken to the armory's
drill hall, said sheriff's spokesman Richard McCarthy, describing
the area as similar to a large gynmasium. Two of the prisoners were
later returned, McCarthy said, adding that all 15 held at the
armory were prison trustees with less than two months more to serve.
   State Sen. Brian Lees, who went to the armory after hearing the
news, said he wasn't sure whether Ashe had the authority to take
over the building.
   ``We're waiting to see if this is legal and whether it falls
under the guidelines of the constitution,'' he said.
   Friday's action followed a week of turmoil at the jail.
   On Wednesday, Westfield District Judge Philip Contant detained
two Hampden County deputies for most of the day when they refused
to take a prisoner back to the jail, acting on Ashe's orders.
   Ashe had refused to return the prisoner because the jail, built
to hold 279 prisoners, had exceeded by one a federal order to house
no more than 500 inmates.
   The jail filled up this week and Ashe's spokesman, Richard
McCarthy, said the other remedies of early release, late sentencing
and housing prisoners elsewhere in western Massachusetts weren't
providing enough spaces.
   Judge Contant said he admired the job Ashe has done under trying
circumstances, but he would pursue contempt charges if prisoners
were turned away from the jail, which takes prisoners whose
sentences are less than 2{ years.
   A new jail has been approved in nearby Ludlow, but that is
expected to take two to three years to build.

   An 80-year-man was killed Thursday,
the third fatality from avalanches in the French Alps the past two
days.
   Joseph Canovas was trying to clear floodwaters from a road near
the village of Les Reyssen when the hillside, loosened by rain and
melting snow from 35 inches of snow this week, swept over him,
firefighters said. Two others were injured.
   The death came hours after an avalanche rumbled down a
mountainside at the Val d'Isere ski resort, causing no injuries but
prompting authorities to warn people to stay indoors and avoid the
famed ski slopes.
   Earlier Thursday police identified two victims of an avalanche
Wednesday as a British school administrator and a French woman.
   Terrance Murnaghan, 46, the director of a nursing school in
London, was crushed in an avalanche at the Val d'Isere. Two French
skiers were seriously injured, police said.
   Cecile Puyg, 17, was killed when an avalanche swept her car from
the road leading to the ski resort of Les Arcs near this
southeastern French city, police said. Three others were seriously
injured when their vehicles were swept off the road.

   Five men reputed to be members of a
terrorist squad linked to Colombian drug lords were arrested Friday
in what authorities say was a plot to free prisoners from a county
jail.
   The five were apprehended along Interstate 95, heading south in
vehicles containing an array of gear including paramilitary
uniforms, a stun gun, knives, two-way radios and smoke grenades,
authorities said.
   They were charged with interstate transportation in aid of
racketeering and could face state charges as well, said U.S.
Attorney Bart Daniel.
   Agent Fred Verinder of the FBI said law agencies around the
nation have received threats that ``Colombian drug cartels would
use Colombian terrorist squads known as `narco-terrorism' to free
Colombians held in American jails.''
   Juan Carlos Perez, a Cuban national, was in the Charleston
County Jail on charges stemming from last year's seizure of 1,069
pounds of cocaine on Hilton Head Island. He goes on trial Monday.
   A defendant convicted earlier in that case, Jorge Samuel Cruz of
Puerto Rico, was also in the jail awaiting sentencing. Testimony in
the trial linked the drugs seized on the island to the Medellin
drug cartel in Colombia.
   In addition, a Colombian national, Alphonso Parada, was in the
jail awaiting trial on state drug charges, authorities said.
   Charleston County Sheriff Al Cannon said authorities received a
tip last week concerning a possible escape attempt by a prisoner.
   The five men arrested were seen outside the jail early Friday
morning in two vehicles with Florida license tags.
   Among other items seized, authorities who searched the cars
found paramilitary uniforms, two-way radios, binoculars, stun guns,
mace containers, black baseball caps and ski masks, flares, hunting
knives, flashlights and about $10,000 in cash.
   The five were arrested without incident, officials said.
   Lydia Glover of the U.S. Marshals Service said the agency has
increased security and notified jails where other federal prisoners
are incarcerated.
   Verinder said the FBI has created a special unit to handle such
cases ``because we're concerned about intelligence reports that
this is going to happen more and more as the extradictables are
returned to the United States.''
   The five arrested were Fernando Botero, 32, of Miami; Jesus
Walter Jaramillo, 45, of Homestead, Fla.; Pedro Aragon, 41, of New
York; Roberto Rego, 47, of Miami; and another individual who
authorities said refused to identify himself.

   Flooding forced hundreds of Southerners to evacuate Friday after
thunderstorms generated tornadoes and up to 10 inches of rain, and
a strong Pacific storm swept inland after dumping up to 3 feet of
snow in the Sierra Nevada.
   ``All of a sudden the roof went one way and the floor went the
other way,'' Frank Higginbotham said of a tornado that struck his
home Friday morning in Alabama. ``I cradled my daughter to my chest
and we were blown through the wall into another room.'' He had a
bump on his head; his daughter was unhurt.
   Thousands of customers still had no power in the Midwest and
Northeast after snow and ice storms. ``Hot wires are falling all
over the place,'' said police dispatcher Rosemarie Million in Erie,
Pa.
   Even sled dog races scheduled this weekend in Truckee, Calif.,
were postponed because of the blinding snow.
   One man apparently drowned Friday in a raging North Carolina
river, and the body of a man washed away by floodwaters was found
in Trion, Ga. Traffic accidents on ice and snow killed at least 11
people since Wednesday _ four each in Kansas and Minnesota, two in
Michigan and one in Missouri.
   In Georgia, a tornado destroyed 15 homes and injured 11 people
in Carrollton, the National Weather Service confirmed.
   And authorities said as many as 1,000 people were evacuated
Friday from Trion in northwestern Georgia after 10 inches of rain
fell in 15 hours and the Chattooga River rushed out of its banks.
   Authorities could not determine if a dam on the Chattooga at
Trion had burst because ``it's 10 feet under water and the currents
are so fast going across it that they can't see the dam,'' said
Chattooga County sheriff's deputy Tammy Owings.
   Schools were closed in Chattooga and other counties of
northwestern Georgia.
   In McCaysville, in extreme northern Georgia near the Tennessee
border, the Toccoa River washed over its banks and forced an
estimated 500 people from their homes, authorities said. No
injuries were reported.
   Just across the state line in Copperhill, Tenn., the Ocoee River
ran out of its banks and flooded the business section of the old
mining town of 400 people.
   ``The entire downtown area of Copperhill is flooded, up to the
second-story windows of buildings,'' said Russell Newman, a
Tennessee Emergency Management Agency official.
   ``It's the worst flooding I've seen in the last seven or eight
years,'' said Police Chief Charles Bond in Eton, Ga. ``Water in
low-lying areas is 6 feet deep. One guy said it was up to the top
of his pickup truck.''
   Roads were flooded, bridges were out and mudslides and
rockslides were reported in several mountainous areas.
   In nearby western North Carolina, up to 6 inches of rain fell
and the body of a man who apparently was swept away from his trout
hatchery was found downstream on the French Broad River, police
said.
   A tornado touched down Friday afternoon in Robeson County near
Maxton, said Robert Ivy, a communications officer with the county
sheriff's department. Three trailers were damaged and one
overturned, causing up to $15,000 in damage, Ivy said. There were
no injuries.
   Officials in Harnett County reported an unconfirmed tornado.
   Some schools were closed because of slippery, muddy roads. But
students in parts of Transylvania County were held in school
because driving conditions were too treacherous for buses.
   An apparent tornado struck rural central Alabama early Friday,
tearing apart a fire department building in Enterprise and
destroying several mobile homes at Cooper, Chilton County sheriff's
officers said.
   Flooding forced hundreds of Alabama residents to evacuate. Water
was over the gas pumps of a service station near Baptist Medical
Center-DeKalb at Fort Payne, where hospital workers used a
motorboat and rowboat because a small bridge leading to the medical
center was flooded.
   Alabama's Shelby County received more than 9 inches in less than
24 hours and 30 people evacuated from two trailer parks that were
under 6 to 8 feet of water had to be moved twice.
   ``We had them in an armory, but the water got so high there we
moved to them to the Baptist and Methodist churches in Pelham,''
said Bill Klein of the Alabama Emergency Management Agency.
   Mississippi Gov. Ray Mabus issued an emergency proclamation for
all the state's 82 counties because of the wind and flood damage,
the first step toward seeking federal disaster aid.
   In east-central Mississippi, in the town of Chunky, ``at the
shelter that was opened at Hickory school, where about 100 people
spent the night Thursday, water is coming up in the front yard,''
said Dusty Perkins of state emergency services.
   In the West, the snowstorm closed more than 70 miles of
Interstate 80 _ the main east-west route across California's Sierra
Nevada _ in both directions from Auburn, the California Highway
Patrol reported.
   At Incline Village, Nev., on Lake Tahoe, Diamond Peak
spokeswoman Lee Weber said the resort had received 3 feet of new
snow by midmorning and had blizzard conditions.
   ``The storm's sure to hurt the holiday traffic in, but some
people can't leave either,'' said Susan Hill of the Reno News
Bureau.
   Wind clocked at 45 mph and low visibility at San Francisco
International Airport closed two of four runways, causing delays of
at least 20 minutes for arriving and departing aircraft, reported
spokesman Ron Wilson.
   On the eastern slope of the Sierra in Nevada, the storm swept
into the Reno-Carson City area, temporarily cutting off power to
230,000 customers snarling traffic, closing schools and shutting
down the Reno airport.
   Driving conditions were poor across parts of Oregon and schools
were closed over a wide area of western Oregon. Traffic was delayed
as long as five hours on Interstate 5 over the Siskiyou Summit,
where chains were required to navigate a foot of new snow.

   A man accused of running an eight-country
heroin ring was sentenced Thursday to life in prison.
   U.S. District Judge Edwin Kosik passed sentence on Ralph
Santana, 64, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., who pleaded guilty last
October to one count of conspiracy to distribute heroin.
   The former Pennsylvia man was arrested last June after a
two-year investigation by state and federal authorities.
   At the time of his arrest, state and federal officials said
Santana was involved in global heroin-cocaine trafficking involving
co-conspirators in England, the Netherlands, France, Mexico,
Colombia, Pakistan, Thailand and the United States.
   Drug enforcement agent Dennis Malloy said Santana conducted drug
business from pay telephones in an attempt to avoid a tapped
telephone line. A phone call for the drug ring could cost up to
$150 in quarters, Malloy said.
   The case involved the U.S. Justice Department's first approval
of a roving wiretap.
   ``This was a very sophisticated network of traffickers,'' said
state Attorney General Ernie Preate Jr. ``They took every step
along the way to defeat law enforcement officers.''

   A guard at a maximum-security prison where
six convicts escaped was arrested Thursday and charged with aiding
the weekend breakout by bringing them hacksaw blades, authorities
said.
   William S. Smith, a guard at the Joliet Correctional Center
since 1977, was charged with conspiracy, official misconduct and
aiding Sunday's escape, Will County State's Attorney Edward A.
Burmila said.
   ``We have eyewitnesses who witnessed him, not only purchasing
hacksaw blades, but having them inside the institution on two
occasions,'' Burmila said, ``and we have evidence that these blades
were the ones used for escape.''
   A blade was found in the cell of one of the escapees, he said.
   Burmila said he did not plan to bring criminal charges against
others.
   Smith, 46, of Joliet was arrested at the prison, and was being
held in lieu of $500,000 bond, Burmila said. Smith was to be
arraigned Friday.
   A state Department of Corrections investigation resulted in the
suspension of Smith and another guard with pay and the reassignment
of three others to less sensitive posts at the prison 40 miles
southwest of Chicago, said department spokesman Nic Howell.
   One escapee was recaptured later Sunday and another was caught
Wednesday, both in Chicago.
   The search continued Thursday for the remaining four escapees,
three of whom are murderers. Prison officials described all four as
extremely dangerous.

   Jack C. Massey, who helped build

age 85.
   From a chain of six drugstores, the Nashville businessman

   In 1964 Massey and businessman John Y. Brown, who later became

   A bomb planted in an unmarked police car
exploded Thursday, killing an undercover narcotics detective in
front of his home, officials said.
   Dennis Wustenhoff, 41, died at Stony Brook University Medical
Center nearly three hours after his car blew up just after noon in
this Long Island city, said hospital spokeswoman Maxine Simpson.
   ``This was probably an assassination and job-connected,'' said
Suffolk County Police Commissioner Daniel Guido. ``But we don't
know whether it was revenge or related to a current case Wustenhoff
was working on.''
   The bomb blew out the entire front part of the late-model white
Cadillac, throwing debris up to 200 feet, Guido said.
   A neighbor who heard the blast ran to the scene and helped pull
Wustenhoff out of the car, the commissioner said.
   The officer was conscious and answered a question from the
neighbor about who might have planted the bomb, Guido said,
refusing to give specifics.
   Wustenhoff was airlifted to the medical center's burn unit,
where he died.
   The bomb was placed either in the engine or under the driver's
seat, Guido said. It was unclear whether the device exploded when
Wustenhoff started the car or when he sat on the driver's seat.
   The car belonged to the police, and was being used in undercover
work, said county District Attorney James Catterson.
   Guido said the slaying in this suburb on Long Island's south
shore more than 70 miles east of New York City ``was not a
street-level operation; it was much higher than that.''
   The car had been parked in front of Wustenhoff's home since 1
a.m. Tuesday, Guido said. The detective had used the car between 5
p.m. and 1 a.m. while working that day.
   Wustenhoff had used the car Tuesday when he went to work at 5
p.m. He parked in front of his small, Cape Cod-style home after
finishing his shift at 1 a.m. Wednesday.
   Federal agents examined the debris Thursday, and county police
dogs sniffed through it for debris.
   Wustenhoff, a 20-year veteran of the police force, has been
decorated 10 times by the department and had worked with federal
Drug Enforcement Administration agents on a number of projects.
   He leaves a wife, a 14-year-old boy and two girls aged 12 and
10. The wife and children were not in the house at the time of the
blast.

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man investigated by the FBI in a rash of mail
bombings across the Southeast twice appeared before a federal
appeals panel on which a slain federal judge served, a television
station reported Thursday.
   WAGA-TV reported that Walter Leroy Moody Jr. of Rex went before
the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in December 1988 to appeal
the dismissal of a lawsuit alleging malicious prosecution and false
arrest when he was charged in 1983 with attempted murder.
   A panel of the 11th Circuit dismissed Moody's appeal, saying it
was premature. The television station said Judge Robert S. Vance
served on that panel.
   Officials with the 11th Circuit confirmed that Moody had gone
before the court.
   On a second appeal in August 1989, Moody went before the panel,
which again included Vance. Oral arguments were heard, and the case
is still pending, the station reported.
   Moody was appealing over allegations made during the 1983 case.
   In that case, he was charged with hiring three Georgia divers to
photograph an underwater propulsion device he planned to market,
then abandoning them in the Gulf of Mexico. Jurors were deadlocked,
and the judge declared a mistrial. The state decided against
retrying Moody.
   Vance was killed by a bomb sent to his Mountain Brook, Ala.,
home Dec. 16. Two days later, Savannah, Ga., attorney Robert
Robinson was killed by a mail bomb. Two other bombs were sent to
targets in Atlanta and Jacksonville, Fla., but intercepted by
authorities.
   Investigators have extensively searched the homes and business
of three men, including Moody, in Alabama and Georgia, though no
one has been charged in the attacks.
   Moody, a literary consultant, was convicted in 1972 in U.S.
District Court in Macon of illegal possession of a bomb.
   Detailed media coverage of the investigation spurred attorneys
for Moody on Thursday to ask U.S. District Judge Richard C. Freeman
to issue a gag order, to seal all documents in the case and to
order the return of items confiscated by agents who searched
Moody's home last week.
   Attorneys for several Atlanta news organizations are opposing
the motions to restrict information about the case.
   Freeman, who said he needed more time to study documents filed
in the case, declined to act on any of the motions. He scheduled
another hearing for Wednesday when, the judge said, ``We'll let it
all hang out.''
   Moody's attorneys argued that the intense publicity over the
bombs probe has hurt Moody's reputation.
   But Freeman said the media has a right to report whatever
information it can get from authorities during an investigation.

   Haitian community leaders dismissed
as racist a new federal policy prohibiting Haitians and sub-Saharan
Africans from donating blood because of the high incidence of AIDS
in their home countries.
   The policy announced this month by the Food and Drug
Administration requires blood collection agencies regulated by the
FDA to refuse blood from donors who were born in, or emigrated from
those countries.
   The decision is based on the high incidence of Africans and
Haitians infected with the AIDS virus through heterosexual contact,
which ``seems to play a major role in transmitting the virus,''
according to the FDA.
   ``We still have the stigma then, that we are carriers of AIDS,''

   They are warriors in a country with more compliant
consumers than consumer complaints.
   Fumio Matsuda, a former auto engineer, is a stinging critic of
the Japanese auto industry's safety performance.
   Katsuko Nomura, a 79-year-old grandmother, singlehandedly
introduced a U.S.-style consumer movement to Japan.
   They are anomalies here, where social harmony is revered and
consumers' interests have been subordinated to the welfare of
Japanese corporations.
   But both have made their mark.
   Mrs. Nomura lobbied for local freedom of information laws, now
enacted in 32 of Japan's 47 prefectures (state) and about 130
cities and towns, and is working to get a national law on the
books. She believes access to information about such things as
chemicals in food will galvanize interest in consumers' rights.
   Matsuda operates a volunteer network of scientists and moles at
Japan's largest auto companies. His 20-year-old Japan Automobile
Consumers Union has uncovered defects in cars and shifted the
spotlight of responsibility onto carmakers, contributing to a
recent unprecedented number of recalls.
   Matsuda, 63, charges Japanese automakers have been feeding their
export success by skimping on safety in domestic models while the
government sets safety standards that are often too low and fails
to enforce others.
   He claims several carmakers have substituted specially built
cars in crash tests of new models for the U.S. and Japanese
markets. But, he adds, the models later sold to consumers probably
would have failed the tests.
   Matsuda uses the information he gets from scientists conducting
chemical analyses of engine parts and employees at auto companies
to help consumers claim damages from allegedly defective cars.
   Japan has no product liability laws, and the lack of legal
precedent increases the burden on consumers to prove fault by
automakers.
   ``I never get discouraged because I know we're right and that
our information is correct,'' says Matsuda, a former engineer at
the Nissan Motor Co.
   He keeps secret the identities of the 25 members of what he
calls his ``brain'' to protect their jobs and his group's
information-gathering ability. They never go to his office, and
rarely call. Sometimes their wives meet to pass information.
   He bristles at the suggestion his network is spying.
   ``They are acting according to their consciences, and everybody
is very proud of what we do.''
   Spokesmen for Japan's major automakers deny Matsuda's charges
and say they do not think their recall records are a problem.
   Bret Anderson, a Honda spokesman, says the company ``deals
within the industry's regulations and standards, or tries to
improve on them.''
   A statement by Toyota Motor Corp. said, ``Mr. Matsuda, like any
other so-called advocate, owes it to the consumers he supposedly
represents to be responsible. Unfortunately, his track record to
date doesn't say much for the sincerity of his implied intentions.''
   That track record includes a conviction for blackmail stemming
from charges brought by a group of Japan's largest automakers in
1971. They accused Matsuda of threatening to publicize information
about defects in their cars unless they paid him. He was sentenced
to four years of probation.
   Matsuda maintains he was negotiating for a group of car owners
who suffered damages from defects and says he is appealing the
conviction.
   Although some of Japan's major media regard Matsuda as an
agitator, the national daily Asahi Shimbun has used his research as
the basis for many newspaper stories, including an award-winning
1987 series on sudden acceleration in Audi imports. The Audis were
recalled later in Japan and in the United States.
   Matsuda lives an austere life. On weeknights, he sleeps on a cot
in his Tokyo office, bulging with files and littered with greasy
auto parts. He sees his wife and two daughters at the family's
seaside home south of Tokyo on weekends.
   He and Mrs. Nomura came from affluent families in which charity
and compassion were taught at an early age.
   Mrs. Nomura recalled that when she was studying at Kyoto's
prestigious Doshisha University in 1931, ``agricultural families
were so poor they were selling their daughters while I was being
taught how to say, `So nice to meet you,' in English class.''
   Sensitive to the gap between the real world and the privileged
one of her birth, she ignored English, read books on Marxism and
social injustice, and married a like-minded classmate.
   Soon afterward she launched a 59-year career of consumer
advocacy that has included organizing labor unions and bringing
news of consumer movements to Japan.
   ``The Japanese people just don't get mad at manufacturers,
they're not concerned with their rights,'' she said. ``So I get
angry for them.''

   A city of low rents and few pretensions
not long ago, Brussels now touts itself as the ``Capital of
Europe'' but friction is building between rich and poor, Belgians
and foreigners.
   Rents and real estate prices are soaring in anticipation of an
influx of new ``Eurocrats'' in 1992 when the European Economic
Community becomes a united, open trading bloc and much more
attention will be focused on Brussels, the EEC headquarters.
   Construction crews are transforming old, modest neighborhoods
into tonier places for new and wealthier inhabitants.
   ``Brussels, Europe's Crossroads of Poverty,'' said a sign
recently in the Marolles, a working-class neighborhood where
inhabitants are being forced out of their homes to make room for
fancy apartments and shops on Sablon Square.
   ``Brussels Sparkles For Europe,'' counters a billboard on the
square where fur-coated customers buy pastries at what has become
the city's priciest bakery or frequent fancy expresso bars,
restaurants and antique shops.
   Near the EEC headquarters, old homes have been bulldozed to make
way for new offices and a $231 million convention center.
   All this, at a price.
   ``You cannot throw out residents like a pile of bricks,'' said
the Rev. Jacques Van der Biest, a Roman Catholic priest and a
leader of the Marolles' protests against sacrificing residents to
urban renewal.
   But as 1992 fever grips Brussels, social considerations are
overwhelmed by real estate speculation.
   Last fall, the Happy Babies nursery in central Brussels got a
surprise eviction notice. The owner who had just bought the
building wanted to sell it for a quick profit.
   Finding no other premises at $550 monthly rent it was paying,
the nursery went into debt to buy the building. A Happy Babies
official said the owner made a $35,000 profit in about a month.
   ``Now we have to spend double to pay off,'' she said. ``We don't
stop talking about money now. The future looks very bleak.''
   Pensioners have been forced out of their apartments to make way
for middle-income families who can no longer afford rents in their
old neighborhoods.
   The market is set to tighten even more, despite a decree
limiting rent increases to inflation for the next year.
   ``We will have a battle between the haves and have-nots for the
available homes,'' said Herve Cnudde, head of the urban
conservation group ARAU. ``It is already the No. 1 issue in
Brussels' social and political circles.''
   Apartments that fetched $250-a-month in rent in 1987 now are
double that in some neighborhoods.
   The blame is laid on the EEC, its 12,000 well-paid Eurocrats _
who get tax breaks locals do not get _ and its 1992 plan, which
will lure even more Eurocrats and lobbyists to this city of just
under a million people.
   In addition to the Eurocrats, Brussels already has 20,000
lobbyists and 800 international trade organizations in operation.
   ``Foreigners can spend a lot more on housing than locals,''
Cnudde said.
   When owners demand big rent increases, many locals opt to move _
some as far off as Antwerp or Charleroi, both 30 miles out.
   ``In the end there will be more foreigners than Bruxellois,''
said Jacqueline Godfroid, a director at the Office of Property
Owners.
   Currently, some 25 percent of Brussels' population is foreign,
including many low-income immigrants from North Africa.
   Foreign investors, however, find Brussels is still a bargain,
despite the increased real estate values.
   ``Over the last two years a lot of people came in to buy:
Scandinavians, Swiss, recently more Japanese and Americans because
they realize the potential of the open market of 1992,'' said
Godfroid.
   Increasingly, she added, they paid ``crazy prices'' for even
dilapidated real estate.
   Van der Biest, the priest, said a house near his Marolles church
that would have fetched less than $100,000 a few years ago was
valued recently at almost a million dollars.
   Serious traffic congestion also has developed because of the
construction of the new office complex and conference center in an
already congested area of narrow, one-way streets.
   ``It is simply not made for such implantations,'' said Cnudde.
``They decided on the site before thinking about the consequences.
It is the world turned around.''

<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Author Bryna Fireside has three children. All
were out of high school by age 16.
   Her daughter, Leela, started college at 15; Douglas graduated at
16 and got a job; Daniel also finished at 16 and went to
California. So what happened to tradition? Why didn't they just
graduate after 12th grade and go straight to college?
   First of all, they're three unusual kids, bright and
non-conformist, who followed their parents' encouragement to live a
little differently, take chances and break a few rules if necessary.
   Also, as Fireside points out in ``Choices: A Student Survival
Guide for the 1990s'' ($10.95, Garrett Park Press), the rules have
changed. Options for high school students are broader and more
accessible than even she considered possible.
   ``If you don't have a good reason for being there, you shouldn't
be in college,'' said Fireside, a free-lance writer and supervisor
of student teachers at Cortland State College. ``It's an expensive
proposition that can really be a marvelous experience if you know
what it is you're after.
   ``There are so many things kids can do by spending a year away.
By the time they get to college, they at least know what they don't
want. They know it's hard to make friends in a work place at a low
level job. For kids who travel and are willing to take that step in
another part of the world, that can also be an eye-opener.''
   Fireside had written magazine articles about high school
students who ``stop out'' _ take time off before college _ and also
researched internship programs and summer schools.
   The students impressed her and so did the parents. For adults,
``Choices,'' is a friendly arm around the shoulder from an
experienced mother and writer. The message: Relax, trust your child.
   ``I was talking to someone in a large suburban area and I
mentioned I had written about `stopping out' between high school
and college. One parent said, `What if she never decides to go to
college?'
   ``If parents value education, the kids will also value
education. That's a very hard concept for parents to accept. A lot
of parents think if they don't guide the kids all the way, if they
let them step out of the mold, all will be lost. People mature at
different rates. We ought to be able to recognize it in teens.''
   ``Choices'' could be called ``The Conceptual Guide to Continuing
Education.'' Structured like a school workbook, Fireside leaves
plenty of room in the margins for notes and comments and includes
dozens of organizations to contact.
   Call it Pop Education as well, important ideas available to all.
   ``There's a lot of information out there but it's not readily
accessible to kids. A lot of guidance counselors don't have
information either, or the kids don't feel comfortable with
guidance counselors.
   ``The information doesn't seem to be in the bookstores. It's a
nice, thin book (111 pages), and easy to read.''
   Fireside includes chapters on internships, travel and jobs
programs. She also discusses the military, a sensitive topic for a
longtime activist who once organized the anti-nuclear ``Tasteful
Ladies for Peace.'' But ``Choices'' means all choices, and for
millions the military is a serious option.
   ``It is a very important part of American life. For those kids
that feel there's something they can contribute to their country,
this is a good way to do it and get a free education. But the
object of the military is not to educate, but to teach how to
kill.''
   Education, Fireside noted, can be resumed at any time, and not
only the young take chances. The most exciting time of her own life
came in her 40s when she went back to school, creating a degree in
children's literature at Cornell University.
   Fireside continues to be challenged by her own children,
especially by Daniel, who at 19 is spending his junior year of
college in Peru and hasn't hesitated to get involved in that
country's turbulent politics.
   ``Even when I didn't agree with what my kid was doing, it was
very exciting seeing my kid doing something he likes doing,'' she
said. ``We all want our kids to be productive and think more about
other things than just themselves.
   ``Many of the kids I talked to were not rebels, but pretty
bright kids who just had something else they wanted to do. What I'm
basically saying is that you don't have to plan out your whole
life, you can just plan six months.''

   It is not every night you see a man give birth.
But it's happening tonight, by golly, on _ where else? _ ``Alien
Nation.''
   This shows how far TV has progressed since little Ricky's
arrival on ``I Love Lucy'' in 1953. For starters, Lucy, who gave
birth to Ricky, didn't have to chase bad guys and get punched in
the beak to induce the blessed event.
   But she was neither a male plainclothes cop nor a Newcomer, as
they call the aliens with the melon-shaped heads on this Fox
network series. Detective George Francisco (Eric Pierpoint) is both.
   In last week's episode, his pregnant wife (Michele Scarabelli),
transferred her tyke-in-progress to George's innards. You see, it
is the Newcomer custom for men to endure the miserable last stages
of pregnancy and to give birth.
   This may not strike Earthmen as a particularly good deal. Be
that as it may, tonight's chapter also has police work facing
George and his human partner, Matt (Gary Graham).
   They must track down a no-good who is selling a brace of
bodybuilders a deadly, addictive, steroid-like drug made from
essence of Newcomer (Newcomer men are far stronger than human
males).
   But the main theme of the episode, ``Real Men,'' is what it
means to be a man. And in its re-examination of conventional male
and female roles, we get a fresh definition of what some call the
New Man.
   (The old definition: A guy who isn't afraid to drink Perrier or
let his date pick up the check).
   As do pregnant Earthlings, George suffers swollen ankles, an
aching back and fears his mate has eyes for others. He also hears a
succession of bad pregnancy jokes that brings him, understandably,
to tears.
   But he doesn't quite catch on when Matt tries to enlighten him
about the concept of macho, about how males are raised to be tough,
to shun tears, and play football on knees so scarred they resemble
beaver hors d'oeuvres.
   George tries, though. ``Ah,'' he says, ``like some Newcomer men.
They don't feel truly masculine until they've given birth.''
   He can't understand why Earthmen worry so much about impotency,
though.
   Such talk fuddles Matt. And while he's extremely sympathetic
about his friend's delicate condition, it's awkward for him that
George, heavy with alien, insists on staying on the job until his
time has come.
   It's equally awkward that a visiting playboy pal (Nick Shockley)
puts the moves on Matt's lovely Newcomer neighbor, Cathy (Terri
Treas). Even though it's only a subplot, Matt gets jealous.
   All this is told in a droll, if slightly leaden manner, with the
finale offering a rousing late-night fight that pits the two
constables against a drug-crazed weightlifter. The fight causes
George to go into labor prematurely.
   Lying down on the floor, gasping for breath, he tells his
frantic partner, ``Put your fists against my temples. It helps
dilate the pouch.''
   Will the babe be boy or girl? When it takes its first breath,
will it emit a tiny cry of ``Na-no-na-no'' or demand to be
interviewed by Geraldo Rivera? Find out for yourself.
   And remember, this is not the arrival of Little Ricky. But if
you do get bored, put your fists against your temples. It helps
dilate the mind.

   YOU CAN'T HEAR ``LOVE SHACK'' ON IT: NBC plans to create a new
monthly newsmagazine, ``NBC News Pulse'' _ on audiocassette. The
ears-only show will recap major news events, and offer reports on
sports, music, film, business, medicine and science. You won't be
able to buy it, though. A spokesman says NBC will offer its
``Pulse'' only to corporations and groups that want it as a

   The winner of Sunday's
presidential election not only has to bring peace but make life
better for people like Liliana Perez, a teacher whose salary of a
million cordobas a month is worth only $18.
   Or the housewife who has to pay 1,000 cordobas for a single
tortilla and 15,000 for a pound of beans.
   Or the worker whose salary has steadily deteriorated the past 10
years as Ms. Perez's has.
   Pumping life back into one of the poorest economies in the
Western Hemisphere most likely will be a crucial agenda item either
for the incumbent Daniel Ortega and his Sandinistas or Violeta
Barrios de Chamorros of the United National Opposition, the main
challenger.
   ``Everything Will Be Better,'' the Sandinistas promised in their
campaign slogan.
   ``UNO Can Change Things,'' said the opposition.
   Says Liliana Perez: ``We are not political, but we are convinced
that this nonsense has got to change.''
   She spoke after school as she helped her mother sell fruit
drinks from a roadside stand to shore up the family budget.
   San Rafael del Sur, about 25 miles southwest of Managua, became
a focus of discontent last year when teachers started a series of
wildcat strikes to protest a standard of living that has plunged
under 10 years of Sandinista rule.
   Ms. Perez, who is in her early 20s and said she will vote for
UNO because of low wages, few jobs, high food prices and
Sandinista-dominated labor unions, which she described as party
cheerleaders instead of worker advocates.
   Real wages have retained only 10 percent of their value since
the Sandinistas toppled dictator Anastasio Somoza in July 1979.
   The Sandinistas acknowledge they have made mistakes but blame
most of Nicagua's problems on a U.S. commercial embargo, the civil
war with the U.S.-backed Contra rebels and 1988 destruction by
Hurricane Joan.
   Their critics say the Sandinistas imposed an inefficient
centralized economy and disastrous fiscal policies, permitted bad
administration and rampant corruption and showed little tolerance
for opponents.
   The critics also maintain that Sandinista policies have been
supported by charity from the Cuba and the old Soviet bloc _
charity they say will disappear now with the collapse of communism
in Eastern Europe.
   Both sides in the races for the presidency, a new National
Assembly and municipal offices seem in agreement that they must
work together after the winners are declared.
   ``In the first place, it is necessary to start an economic
reconstruction of the country,'' Vice President Sergio Ramirez said
in a recently published interview. ``For that it is necessary to
think first of a concordance of all the social forces after the
elections.''
   Apart from agreeing that cooperation is crucial, the Sandinistas
have not come out with a clear program on how they will achieve the
increased production needed to bankroll an array of social projects.
   Their opponents also know cooperation is vital to the country
but keep pushing their demands for a ``tropical perestroika,'' as
some of them put it, as a condition for that cooperation.
   ``There is no sense in us making a concordance or an economic
pact'' under current conditions, said Gilberto Cuadra, president of
the Council of Private Enterprise, Nicaragua's most influential
consortium of private business.
   ``The system in itself doesn't make any sense anymore, either
here, or in Cuba or in Eastern Europe.''
   In January, the business council, which backs Mrs. Chamorro,
made a series of proposals that strike at the heart of the
Sandinista economic system.
   Among the most important points, the document calls for
establishing trust between government and private enterprise and
doing away with centralized state planning of the economy.
   But Alejandro Martinez, minister of planning and budget, said
the banking system and foreign trade will continue as nationalized
sectors of the economy, run by the central government, something
that left businessmen shaking their heads in frustration.
   Relations between the leftist government and private enterprise
have not visibly improved in the last year.
   In May, the government confiscated three large coffee farms when
their owners criticized government policies.
   A few weeks ago, in a campaign speech, President Ortega
threatened to confiscate a cooking oil processing factory. He had
accused the factory's manager, a relative of Mrs. Chamorro, of
causing a cooking oil scarcity to hurt the government. Shortly
after Ortega's speech, the government announced it was importing
several tons of soybeans to make cooking oil.
   ``Mr. Ortega couldn't hide his totalitarian instincts and he
decided to make a show of who's boss,'' Cuadra remarked when asked
about the incident.

<TEXT>
   A new Sandinista government would be operating under
circumstances radically different from those of 10 years ago.
   Ortega returned from a 10-nation European trip last April with
only $50 million in promises for aid, and that was before Communist
governments began falling apart in the East.
   With Eastern Europe now ready to absorb the financial good will
of Western Europe and a strapped Soviet Union reluctant to continue
handouts, the Sandinistas will not be able to rely on foreign
donations, estimated to have averaged $400 million a year.
   International lending organizations heavily influenced by the
United States seem to be one of the few lifesavers left for the
Sandinistas, but those loans will be forthcoming only if a
Sandinista government seems serious about righting the economy and
if it manages to persuade the United States the elections were
fair, regardless of the outcome.
   At the beginning of 1989, Ortega announced a stringent economic
austerity program that slashed the public budget by nearly half and
called for the firing of at least 30,000 public employees.
   The aim was to rein in inflation that had shot up to a world
record of 33,600 percent in 1988. According to government figures,
inflation was down to a 1,700 percent annual rate by the end of
1989.
   However, the government has refused to say how many people were
actually laid off and some economists say the inflation rate is
higher than 1,700 percent because the cost of a basket of staples
like beans and rice has risen 5,000 percent.
   The Sandinistas continued mass subsidies to a plethora of
workers, and some public employees, notably those of the Interior
Ministry, received hefty raises.
   UNO would seem to have an easier, though by no means easy, time
in starting up the economy.
   For one thing, the United States most certainly would lift the
commercial embargo it imposed on the Sandinista government in 1985.
That would bring in U.S. aid and foreign loans to restart
production and a large and profitable market for Nicaragua's
traditional agricultural export crops.
   A U.S.-backed government, especially one that projects
stability, also would have an easier time attracting foreign
investment.
   But to achieve that stability, UNO would have to gain the
cooperation of the Sandinistas in order to avert strikes by
Sandinista-dominated labor unions that could thwart any economic
effort.
   When the Sandinistas started their anti-inflation program last
year, hundreds of teachers nationwide went on wildcat strikes for
higher pay, following the lead of San Rafael de Sur teachers, in
defiance of their pro-Sandinista labor union.
   That and strikes by cab drivers brought the Sandinistas
face-to-face with their first serious labor unrest.
   Ortega gave pay raises to the teachers and subsidies to the
cabbies, but those gains were soon eroded by inflation.
   ``What they have done to us is too much,'' said Ms. Perez. ``I
can't forget that.''
   Even those who say they will vote Sandinista are counting on
brighter days ahead.
   ``If they're elected, the war will end. Then we'll have to
demand that the economy gets better,'' said Ambrosio Sanchez, 26,
who weaves hammocks with his wife, Josefa, in Masaya, near Managua.
   What if the economy doesn't improve?
   ``We'll have to see,'' he said, somberly looking at his wife and
his 4-year-old son, bare-bottomed and barefoot playing in the dirt.

   Profits plunged by 50 percent at General Motors
Corp. and by 72.9 percent at Ford Motor Co. in the fourth quarter,
as the nation's biggest automakers showed the impact of slow sales
and costly buyer incentives.
   The quarterly results reported Thursday completed a sharp drop
in annual earnings for the nation's Big Three automakers, which
have been struggling with an industrywide slump that has prompted
plant closings and thousands of layoffs.
   Autoworkers will get more bad news this spring: the decline in
profits at GM, Ford and Chrysler Corp. will mean little or no

   The Bush administration got the go-ahead to
finance its savings and loan bailout by borrowing through the
Treasury, a method that could balloon the budget deficit this year
by tens of billions of dollars and temporarily push up short-term
interest rates.
   The Justice Department ruled Thursday that the Resolution Trust
Corp., the agency created to dispose of failed thrifts, may legally
borrow from the Federal Financing Bank.
   S&amp;L bailout legislation enacted in August provided $50 billion
through next year to cover the losses in failed thrift
institutions. But the RTC needs to borrow as much as an additional
$100 billion.

   Housing starts jumped a record 29.6 percent
last month as builders took advantage of the warmest January ever,
the government reported, but analysts said the industry could not
sustain the pace.
   ``Levels like the ones we're seeing here would indicate a

believe that is going on,'' Thomas Holloway, senior economist for
the Mortgage Bankers Association, said Thursday.
   Housing starts tumbled to 1.37 million last year, the lowest
level since the 1982 recession, and many analysts do not expect
much improvement in 1990 because of a weak economy and high

   The two retailers, both divisions of Toronto-based Campeau
Corp., filed Jan. 15 for bankruptcy protection from creditors,
listing $7.7 billion in debts.

   IBM unveiled a line of computer workstations
that the company says outperform and underprice the competition and
should help it snare a major stake in a fast-growing market where
it never had success.
   ``The opportunity is big _ it's growing at over 30 percent a
year, and it's mostly a new opportunity for IBM,'' President Jack
D. Kuehler said Thursday.
   The machines, called the RISC System-6000, also mark the first
time that the world's largest computer maker has wholeheartedly
embraced the Unix computer operating system that is fast becoming
the industry standard.

   Store owners in Israel, Australia and Switzerland
pulled bottles of Perrier sparkling water from the shelves as a
general worldwide recall got under way.
   But beverage industry analysts remained divided Thursday about
whether the tony brand in the distinctive green bottle will ever
recover its prestige.
   The recall affects 160 million bottles of the water in 120
countries and could cost the company as much as 200 million French

   If Wall Street were a Western movie, people could
call the sheriff to corral rustlers who ride off with corporate
gold instead of putting it into research and updated plants needed
to compete.
   That's basically what Michigan State University economics
Professor Walter Adams urges in ``Dangerous Pursuits,'' a recently
published book on the 1980s mania for mergers and takeovers that in
light of recent events seems prophetic.
   ``Dodge City needs a sheriff to maintain law and order, to break
up the brawls and to restore sanity to its inhabitants. So does
Wall Street,'' he and co-author James W. Brock conclude in a
chapter on ``Cowboy Capitalism.''
   The kind of deals that characterized the 1980s kept
entrepreneurs from creating new wealth, new jobs and increased
competitiveness, they argue in the book. A rash of financial crises
and bankruptcies at companies that expanded using high-risk ``junk
bond'' debt is one of the consequences.
   ``These are jerry-built structures, basically,'' Adams said in
an interview. ``They are a prime example of excessive speculation.''
   The warnings in the book were underscored this past week, when
the once-mighty Wall Street pioneer of the junk bond-financed
takeover business sought bankruptcy protection itself. Few believe
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. will survive, and many say the era of
unbridled junk financing is probably over.
   Mergers and acquisitions are the ``Dangerous Pursuits'' Adams
and Brock, a Miami University of Ohio economics professor, describe
in the book published by Pantheon Books in New York.
   The two previously wrote ``The Bigness Complex,'' on the
influence of power groups in the U.S. economy. The book was named
one of the top 10 business books of 1987 by Business Week magazine.
   Brainpower focused on wheeling and dealing for profit could be
used better to improve U.S. companies' productivity or
competitiveness, or to cut public and private debt that weighs down
the economy, Adams said.
   Managers get into deep and unfamiliar waters when preoccupied by
mergers, whether they're the hunter or the hunted, he said.
   The book quotes Esmark creator Donald P. Kelly as saying his
company did everything from drilling for oil to selling meat and
manufacturing bras, and, ``All it tells you is that you can be head
of a holding company and not be very smart about anything.''
   Adams said unfamiliarity was a reason Campeau Corp.'s 260-store
retailing empire _ owner of Burdines, Lazarus, Jordan Marsh,
Bloomingdale's and other well-known chains _ wound up in bankruptcy
court seeking to reorganize and repay more than $7 billion in debts.
   Robert Campeau went far afield when he bought Allied for $3.6
billion in 1986 and Federated for $6.6 billion in 1988, Adams said.
``He's a real estate operator from Canada buying two major retail
store chains in the United States.''
   Campeau used junk financing that cost him more than 16 percent
interest on much of the debt. ``He financed it with junk bonds,
which you might call the fake wampum of the 1980s,'' Adams said.
   Among Adams' and Brock's suggestions to divert corporate
brainpower and resources into constructive avenues:
   _End tax deductions for the interest on debt incurred simply to
transfer corporate control.
   _Put a sliding tax on capital gains from sales of assets _ high
if the assets are held a short time, low if they are held longer.
   _Enforce antitrust laws. The Clayton Act prohibits mergers or
acquisitions that lessen competition or create a monopoly.

   There's something appropriate about
Hasbro Inc.'s new line featuring New Kids on The Block. It's the
first venture that smacks of Alan Hassenfeld since he became the
new man in charge.
   Hassenfeld labored for years in the shadow of his older brother,
Stephen. His brother's death of pneumonia last June at age 47,
however, thrust Hassenfeld into the limelight as chairman and chief
executive officer.
   Although the younger Hassenfeld had worked in the company in
various capacities for two decades, including president since 1984,
there were some who doubted his credentials.
   They wondered whether his experience as head of the
international division had prepared him to run the nation's largest
toy company. But as Hasbro touts its 1990 products at the annual
Toy Fair in New York, the reports are that he is doing fine.
   In an interview during the toy trade show this week, Hassenfeld
said several of Hasbro's toys making their debut demonstrate that
the company can respond quickly to what consumers want.
   ``I think New Kids very definitely is a fascinating new
introduction for us _ something that we had not been doing much of
in the past,'' he said of the line of dolls and accessories based
on the popular singing group.
   Berlin Wall commemorative puzzles from Hasbro's Milton Bradley
division also illustrate the company's responsiveness, he said.
   ``I think it's very important that we be very topical. It just
shows that we can move and move very quickly.''
   Industry analysts and Hasbro insiders say that by going after a
licensing pact with a hot group, such as the New Kids, Hasbro
signaled a new approach to doing business.
   ``I think a few years ago Hasbro might not have picked up a
license like New Kids on the Block. That's something Alan has
accomplished to his tribute,'' said Al Verrecchia, one of Hasbro's
chief operating officers.
   ``Alan is putting his mark on the company very quickly,
signaling that he is going to very aggressively manage it for
growth in the 1990s,'' said Paul Valentine, an analyst with
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.
   ``The promotional side of the business had suffered in recent
years,'' he said. ``The company, as was the case with other large
toy companies, had become more bureaucratic and less innovative.''
   Some critics had faulted Hasbro in the past for resting on its
laurels and relying too heavily on classics like G.I. Joe, My
Little Pony and The Game of Life.
   ``Alan is willing to try something that's unorthodox and
innovative,'' Valentine said.
   Another thing Hassenfeld has been able to do is squelch the
takeover rumors that surfaced after his brother's death.
   ``The odds of a takeover have sharply been reduced by the
passage of time and the fact that Alan is very aggressively
assuming control of the company,'' Valentine said.
   Hassenfeld said he has ``no intentions whatsoever about moving
away from this business.''
   A 41-year-old with a boyish sense of fun and a disarming smile,
Hassenfeld expressed devotion to the company founded by his
grandfather, Henry, as Hassenfeld Brothers in 1923.
   The founding Hassenfeld family owns 13.1 percent of Hasbro's
stock and has effective voting control over another 13.6 percent.
   When Stephen Hassenfeld became chairman in 1980, the company,
which also is parent of the Playskool division, had $102.3 million
in revenue. Last year, revenue grew to $1.41 billion from $1.36
billion in 1988 and earnings were up 27 percent to $92 million from
$72 million.
   Hassenfeld, who studied creative writing at the University of
Pennsylvania, seems to genuinely like what he's doing.
   ``I've lived and died this business for over 21 years. It's in
my blood and I love it,'' he said.``What other business could I be
in that part of the day I can honestly be that seven-year-old?''
   He added impishly: ``If you walked into my office and I was
sitting on all fours playing ... I could legitimately get away with
it and I could say I was product-testing or something.''

   An East German company that has
purchased a U.S. distributor of printing machines says it will
out-hustle capitalist competitors to improve the company's sales.
   As Western businessmen stream to the East bloc looking for
investments, the state-owned Polygraph Export-Import Co. has gone
West, making East Germany's first U.S. acquisition.
   The West German bank that loaned Polygraph $25 million for the
deal says Americans would be surprised by the entrepreneurial drive
of citizens long ruled by hard-line Communists.
   ``If this deal is successful _ and I'm certain it will be _ it
could be just the start of a series of such ventures here,'' said
Arnold Schlappig, general manager of the New York branch of
Bayerische Hypotheken und Weschsel-Bank, or Hypobank.
   ``The guys who did this deal (are) very open-minded,
internationally oriented businessmen who understand capitalism,''
Schlappig said. ``Other East German companies just need an
additional injection and they could export tomorrow.''
   Polygraph, which exports machinery from five East German
companies, said it bought Royal Zenith Inc., its U.S. distributor,
to improve sales and technological ties with American businesses.
The price was not disclosed. The company's name has since been
changed to Planeta North America Inc.
   Frank an East German manager who is vice president of the new
company, said the political changes in his country hastened the
deal.
   The negotiations began while Communist hard-liner Erich Honecker
was still in power in East Germany. But Seifert said there was less
paperwork after Honecker was ousted Oct. 18 and democratic
reformers took over, opened the Berlin Wall, brought non-Communists
into the government and promised elections.
   ``We were hoping for a long time that this development would
happen,'' said at company headquarters in a hillside industrial
park just east of New York City.
   ``Let's say some of my dreams, politically and professionally,
were realized by this.''
   Seiffert, 49, a former salesman of computers and photocopiers,
is one of two East Germans among 150 employees at the company,
which expects sales of $50 million this year.
   Several members of the new U.S. management team are former
executives of Royal Zenith who had left the company in recent
years. Among them is the former company president, Allan Malachuk,
who takes his old post.
   After rumors of a sale and low morale among workers for several
years, ``there's an open-door policy here again,'' said operations
manager Jeffrey Post, who has been with the company for 14 years.
   He said the German representatives are interested in making more
contacts with U.S. graphics art companies to help improve designs
of their printing machines _ and increase sales.
   In recent years, ``we had sort of an adversarial relationship
with the (East German) factories. Their government was a problem
back then, and it was difficult to exchange even things like
blueprints and work documents.''
   The company's main competitors are Japanese and West German
manufacturers, which pay less than 4 percent in duties on imported
machinery, compared to the 10 percent charged East Germany.
   ``Perhaps in America, you should have a certain perestroika,''
said Seiffert, using the Soviet term for economic restructuring to
refer to U.S. tariff policy.
   The Bush administration has said it will make changes in trade
policy after East German elections March 18.
   Seiffert said several investment and financing companies have
asked him for ideas on East German acquisitions.
   He said he is not fearful that Western investors will dominate
or exploit East Germany.
   Polygraph in 1988 accounted for $40 million of East Germany's
$130 million in exports to the United States. Polygraph's
associated printing companies have pioneered technological changes
in the industry, said Bob McKinney, a former Royal Zenith executive
who became vice president for marketing after the acquisition.
   Post said the sale might have aroused suspicion among Royal
Zenith employees when East Germany was a strict Communist state,
but not now.
   ``I think a big part of the resistance is gone. The Wall has
come down,'' he said. ``Now that they're changing to the American
system, there's no problem. It's just two guys doing business.''

<HEAD>Scientist Who Found Tainted Perrier Sympathizes With French
Bottler</HEAD>

   Tom Ward recalled reading the label on a
Perrier bottle after he detected traces of the toxic chemical
benzene in the bubbly water.
   ``The label said it had been bottled since 1863,'' said Ward,
the environmental lab director for Mecklenburg County.
   ``I pondered over that for a few minutes. They are practically
an institution, like Coke in this country. But never in my mind was
there any thought of not telling someone.
   ``We checked (our results) very closely,'' he said. ``Once we
made the call to the FDA we were 100 percent sure. There was no
doubt whatsoever.''
   Perrier isn't regarded lightly at the lab. Indeed, technicians
there use the French sparkling water as a purity standard against
which they test 25,000 water samples a year. So when benzene was
found in six bottles with the same lot number last month, Ward
notified federal officials and sent them two unopened bottles from
the same batch.
   Sure enough, the Food and Drug Administration found traces of
the cancer-causing chemical in both bottles.
   Ward's findings have turned out to be a multimillion-dollar
headache for the French bottler, which has decided to dump 160
million bottles at an estimated cost of $35 million.
   ``We felt a lot of responsibilty ... a weight on our
shoulders,'' said Ward, a 19-year county employee. Nevertheless,
``when we let it out, we knew it was the right decision.''
   Earlier this week, about 72 million bottles of Perrier were
withdrawn from the U.S. market based on the tests in Ward's lab.
The recall since has spread to 120 countries around the world.
   Thad Wester, North Carolina's deputy health director, called the
move ``primarily a business decision.''
   ``To put it in perspective, the risks were not all inordinately
great,'' he said of the chances of anyone getting cancer from
drinking the water. ``What he did was what any responsible
scientist would do. He recognized something was wrong and instead
of just forgetting about it, he did something.''
   Ward sympathized with the economic hardship the disclosure has
caused for the French company, which is yanking shipments in 120
countries.
   ``I have concerns about that, but I'm also concerned about the
benzene in the water,'' he said. ``Those concerns are greater to me
than the financial problems it causes Perrier.''
   In Paris, Perrier officials said some shipments of the bottled
water were contaminated by a dirty filter at the company's
underground spring in Vergeze, France. The filter is designed to
remove naturally occurring benzene from the carbon dioxide gas that
gives Perrier its distinctive bubble.
   ``It was complete negligence,'' said the company's managing
director, Frederik Zimmer, who added that the workers involved had
been disciplined.
   Importers have been advised to dump the bottles of the water on
site and return the bottles to the company for cleaning and
refilling.
   The decision is expected to disrupt distribution for about three
months.
   Ward said the company was not overreacting.
   ``I don't think it poses an imminent health problem, but why
take any additional risks?'' he said. ``I think they're acting in
the right way.''
   As for his staff's actions, Ward said they performed admirably.
   ``I think we did a good job,'' he said. ``We do this kind of
testing on surface water every day. When we find contamination, we
report it. But it usually doesn't cause such a stir.''

<HEAD>Ford, GM Earnings Slide, Profit-Sharing Too</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Profit-sharing checks for more than a
half-million General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. employees will
be significantly lower this spring because of a sagging U.S. auto
market.
   No one at Chrysler Corp. will receive profit-sharing payments
because the company didn't make enough money in the United States
last year. Chrysler workers got an average of $720 each in 1988.
   The dramatic drop in profit-sharing is yet another piece of
evidence that the U.S. auto industry is in recession.
   On Thursday, GM reported a 50 percent decline in fourth-quarter
earnings, and Ford said its profits for the period plunged 72.9
percent. Earlier in the week, Chrysler said it lost $664 million in
the final three months of 1989.
   The declines reflected stagnating sales and the high costs of
incentives, including cash rebates and low-interest financing
plans. Automakers said they were giving away up to $1,000 to sell
each car at the end of last year.
   Profit-sharing figures are based, in part, on the profitability
of the companies' U.S. automotive operations. For the past several
years, GM and Ford have been relying on overseas earnings to help
prop up the corporations profits. Chrysler has few overseas
operations.
   Ford plans this afternoon to release the amount of its
profit-sharing payments for about 150,000 hourly and salaried
employees. On Thursday, Ford Treasurer David McCammon said it would
be substantially less than last year's average payment of $2,800.
   Annual profits from Ford's U.S. automotive operations, which
serve as a base for profit-sharing, declined 38 percent in 1989,
McCammon said.
   GM officials said its 443,000 eligible hourly and salaried
workers would get about $50 each in profit-sharing payments next
month.
   Last year, GM employees got an average of $265 in profit-sharing.
   News of the sharply lower profit-sharing came seven months
before the United Auto Workers contracts with the Big Three expire.
It blackens the cloud over the talks already darkened by plant
closings and temporary and indefinite layoffs, which are likely to
make job security the top issue when negotiations open in July.
   ``The fact is that UAW workers have given the most effort and
attention to rebuilding GM's strength where it counts the most, on
the shop floor,'' said Stephen Yokich, head of the UAW's GM
Department. ``They are not responsible for GM's costly blunders,
including its repeated failures to understand and target a rapidly
changing vehicle market.''
   GM earned $700.2 million in the quarter ended Dec. 31, or $1.01
a share, compared with $1.4 billion, or $2.12 a share, in the same
period of 1988.
   Ford posted profits of $314 million, or 68 cents a share,
compared with $1.16 billion, or $2.42 a share, a year earlier.
   Ford's earnings declined largely because of a $424 million loss
linked to the sale of its Rouge Steel Co. subsidiary. But even
without that factor, earnings were down 36.3 percent.
   For the entire year, GM earned $4.22 billion, down 13.2 percent
from 1988. Ford's earnings fell 27.6 percent to $3.84 billion last
year.
   Together, Big Three profits in 1989 were $8.42 billion, 24.9
percent lower than the year before.
   Incentives took big bites from each of the company's earnings,
especially in the fourth quarter. They could continue to take a big
bite out of profits in the current quarter, especially for
Chrysler. Incentives were on during all of January for the
company's popular minivans, which boosted sales of light truck
sales, but cost the company in the meantime.
   McCammon said Ford spent an average of $800 in incentives for
every car and truck it sold in the fourth quarter, slightly more
than double what Ford spent a year earlier.
   And by the end of the quarter, Ford was spending about $1,000 on
incentives for each of its vehicles.
   ``They're as high as they ever have been,'' he said, but added
that as production and inventory levels come back into line, the
need for incentives will decline.
   GM declined to say what its incentive costs were in the fourth
quarter, but officials said the company spent about $800 per
vehicle during the entire year, up about $100 from 1988. It was
likely that because of heavier use of incentives toward the end of
the year, GM spent more than $800 a vehicle in the fourth quarter.
   Chrysler spokesman Tom Houston said the company does not
disclose incentive costs, but it is likely that the costs weren't
much different from GM's or Ford's.

   Junk bond traders knew the end was near when the
art came off the walls at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s famous
Beverly Hills, Calif., office.
   The investment house made famous by Michael Milken began closing
up shop in New York and Los Angeles on Thursday. Drexel said
several thousand of the firm's 5,300 workers would get the ax today.
   In addition to taking down artwork, employees said Drexel
changed the locks on some doors and stationed guards in lobbies to
prevent workers from walking off with computers, sensitive
documents and other materials. That material presumably could be
sold as Wall Street's ex-powerhouse liquidates.
   Some employees were angry, others resigned, still others eager
to move on after three years of turmoil at the firm credited with
altering American finance with the junk bond _ a high-risk,
high-yield piece of debt that let some small companies grow and
others mount successful raids on corporate titans.
   Drexel's parent company filed for bankruptcy protection Tuesday
in New York after defaulting on $100 million in short-term debt.
Drexel blamed its demise on a capital shortage created in part by a
decline in the junk bond market. An erosion of confidence in the
firm didn't help either.
   ``The offers are pouring in,'' joked Joe Bencivenga, co-director
of high-yield research in Beverly Hills, where Milken moved the
junk bond division in 1978. Drexel said it was terminating the bulk
of the division's 400 employees today.
   Bencivenga said professionals in the division _ located at the
corner of Wilshire Boulevard and Rodeo Drive in a building owned by
Milken and some partners _ were banding together in search of
employment.
   ``There are a lot of individuals, a bunch of splinter groups.
They form, they dissipate, they form. It's an active molecular
structure,'' he said.
   ``People are cleaning out their stuff, typing their resumes and
using the fax machine and phones extensively,'' he added. ``I don't
think there's any offers yet. There's a lot of interest. It's only
been one day.''
   On Wall Street, firms were inundated with resumes and calls from
soon-to-be ex-Drexel employees. Drexel was seeking to transfer
whole departments to other firms for free as part of its unwinding.
   Bencivenga, who has been with Drexel since 1985 when the firm
was at its heyday, was optimistic in the face of unemployment.
   ``I look at it as a major opportunity,'' he said. ``It's not
very often in life you get to stop what you're doing'' and start
anew.
   Some employees were angry about the frequent pleas by Drexel
Chief Executive Frederick Joseph over the last three years to stand
by the firm as it took a public flogging during the government's
lengthy insider trading investigation.
   Joseph's pep talks were said to have boosted morale when Drexel
hit its lowest ebb last year, pleading guilty to six felonies and
agreeing to pay $650 million to settle civil and criminal fraud
charges rather than face a racketeering indictment that could have
crippled the firm instantly.
   ``There was a very high price to the loyalty we paid these
guys,'' said a Drexel research analyst in New York who asked not to
be named. ``We stayed and stayed and stayed. It seems at the end
the reason the company went under is just a simple asset-liability
problem. Who was running the show?''
   Others were bitter that Drexel didn't warn its employees the end
was near. The net worth of many Drexel workers, who own 54 percent
of the stock in the privately held parent company, may have
evaporated with the bankruptcy filing because stockholders
typically stand at the end of the bankruptcy line.
   ``Those people aren't going to get paid anything now because the
stock is worthless,'' said a longtime Drexel executive who left the
firm recently. ``People could have been finding jobs out there in a
normal period of time. It's just very poor management.''
   The junk bond division was altered drastically by Milken's
criminal problems. He quit the firm last June after his 98-count
indictment, but had been working only part-time for close to a year.
   Under Milken's forceful and well-connected leadership, Drexel
drummed up business seemingly at will and junk bonds generated
large majority of the firm's profits. That changed after his
departure, though Drexel still controlled 38.6 percent of junk-bond
underwriting in 1989.
   Said Bencivenga: ``That was a whole different era, that was a
whole different controversy.''

<HEAD>Whittle Says 2,510 Schools Signed, $200 Million in Ads Sold for
Channel One</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Whittle Communications has signed 2,510 schools
to three-year contracts and has sold $200 million in advertising
for its commercially sponsored Channel One news program for the
classroom, debuting March 5.
   Christopher Whittle, chairman of Knoxville, Tenn.-based media
company, said Thursday the schools have agreed to show the daily
12-minute news program, which is tailored to teens and includes two
minutes a day of commercials.
   He said the ad contracts also cover three years, including about
$65 million in the first year. That amounts to about two-thirds of
the revenue that the company hopes to earn from Channel One ad
sales.
   At a news conference, Whittle said the program will be seen in
400 schools with 300,000 students on the launch date and that 1,000
schools should be showing it by the end of March.
   Whittle said the number of participating schools will rise each
week as the company installs television monitors and other
equipment. He said was confident of reaching his goal of signing
7,000 to 8,000 schools with six million students by December. Those
signed to date are in 34 states.
   Whittle declined to identify any of the schools or sponsors.
   The program has provoked critics who charge it is wrong for
schools to hand over a captive audience to a commercial enterprise,
selling access to makers of soap, candy or other products.
   The cable television industry has responded by developing
commercial-free programs for use in the classroom. Turner
Broadcasting Systems Inc.'s Cable News Network, for instance, has
been running a daily 15-minute news program tailored to teens since
August.
   Bert Carp, an executive at Turner, said more than 7,000 schools
have enrolled to use the show called ``CNN Newsroom'' and said its
surveys showed more than half of them are actively using the
program.
   But Whittle contends that schools are ill-equipped to make use
of those programs and that a survey conducted for his company
indicated virtually none of 1,500 students contacted by telephone
at home indicated they had seen a news program in school. Whittle
blamed a lack of TV sets in classrooms.
   Schools that agree to show the Channel One program to their
students get television monitors for every classroom, a satellite
dish and two videocassette recorders. The school keeps the
equipment only as long as it runs the show.
   In addition to the daily news show, schools are permitted to use
the equipment for non-commercial programming, including specials
that are being made available from public television for use in the
schools.
   Whittle was accompanied at the news conference by former U.S.
education secretary Terrell H. Bell, who heads a committee of
educators advising Channel One, and others.
   The company also said it awarded a $900,000 grant to the
University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research and the firm
Interwest Applied Research to study Channel One's ``contribution to
education over the next three years.''
   State education officials in California and New York have banned
Channel One from their public schools. Whittle said he expected to
meet his goals without public schools from either state.
   Cynthia Kalish Samuels, a former planning producer for NBC's
``Today Show'' was named executive producer of the Channel One
staff in October and has assembled a staff to produce stories for
the program.
   She said one featured topic in the first week of programs will
be the ramifications of the fall of the Berlin Wall, while
subsequent weeks will have five daily segments on drugs, South
Africa and the summer job outlook.

<HEAD>Merchants Fret Over Spring Training Impasse</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN MURPHY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VERO BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was a perfect day to begin spring
training. A sea breeze was blowing toward right field. The sun cast
crisp shadows. The air was sweet with citrus and freshly trimmed
grass.
   But there was no crack of the bat; no ring of the cash register.
   ``It's kind of weird isn't it?'' Dodgertown ticket manager Olive
Maiher said Thursday. ``Everything should be coming to life, and
instead it's just nothing.''
   Outside the empty ticket counter and souvenir stand, a man in
sunglasses was taking a nap.
   Since 1949, Vero Beach has been decking itself in Dodger blue to
welcome their major league heros from Los Angeles.
   This year, however, merchants and city officials are seeing red,
worried about the possible loss of their share of the $300 million
in revenue spring training brings to Florida each year.
   Only minor leaguers will be allowed to the spring training camps
in Florida and Arizona under a lockout by owners, who are battling
players over salaries and other revenue-related issues.
   Pitchers, catchers and injured players had been scheduled to
report to the Dodgertown baseball compound Thursday.
   In Vero Beach, one of 18 spring training sites in Florida, the
Dodgers pump $20 million to $25 million into the local economy each
year, said J.B. Norton Jr., executive vice president of the Vero
Beach-Indian River Chamber of Commerce.
   A lockout until the opening of the regular season would cost
Vero Beach merchants up to $5 million, he said. The Dodgers' minor
league teams and other activities will keep some of the revenue
flowing.
   ``It's not going to kill us, but it's not going to feel good
either,'' he said.
   A 1987 study by the Florida Commerce Department concluded fans
spent more than $286 million at spring training and teams spent
about $12 million.
   Among those with the most to lose by the lockout are restaurants
and automobile rental agencies, said Norton.
   At Avis Rent A Car near the small Vero Beach airport, manager
Joe Brennan has 30 cars that normally would be taken by Dodger
players and personnel. He didn't even bother requesting the
additional 40 cars he needed last year.
   ``It's really going to hurt us if the lockout goes on, but we'll
survive,'' said Brennan. ``It trickles down through the whole
community. If there are no games, everyone will suffer to some
extent from the hot dog vendors to the gas stations.
   ``What's really a shame is the people who come down to see
baseball and experience spring training. They are the real losers
in all this.''
   Both economically and emotionally, the Dodgers are held dear in
Vero Beach, about 140 miles north of Miami.
   The town celebrated wildly following the Dodgers' 1988 World
Series victory. Many residents boast the lavish Dodgertown complex
far outshines the rival New York Mets' spring headquarters 20 miles
south in Port St. Lucie. A Dodgers' cap is featured on the masthead
of the local daily newspaper.
   ``This is a Dodger town and it will always be,'' said Alex
Carson, a patron at Duke Snider's Restaurant and Bar, named for the
Hall of Fame Brooklyn Dodger second baseman.
   ``If there's no spring training this year, you know the old
saying, `We'll get 'em next year.'''
   Near Duke Snider Road in Dodgertown, Bill Richards and Elmer
Otto sat on a railroad tie and took it easy Thursday.
   There were wearing their blue Dodger spring training T-Shirts
and caps, but it didn't seem like a work day. Richards is assigned
to the batting cage and Otto is a cashier at the stadium.
   Richards raised his hand in a mock toast.
   ``Well, here's to spring training,'' he said.
   ``Yup,'' said Otto.
   They got up and walked toward the dugouts.

<HEAD>Futures Watchdog Declares Drexel's British Unit in Default</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Drexel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s British unit has
been declared in default, and regulatory groups have begun
liquidating its contracts in cocoa, coffee, base metals and
financial futures.
   The Association of Futures Brokers and Dealers,the International
Commodities Clearing House and the London Metal Exchange took the
action Thursday. Drexel refused to comment.
   The investment bank's parent, Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc.,
filed for U.S. Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection Tuesday and
began the biggest fire sale in the history of the securities
industry, liquidating billions of dollars in assets.
   An statement by the British association of brokers and dealers
said it took swift action Thursday after receiving information
suggesting Drexel violated association ``rules relating to
financial record keeping and financial resources.''
   The Financial Times, Britain's leading business daily, quoted an
unidentified London Metal Exchange representative as saying:
   ``The Drexel people can't even sign a check without the
(association's) approval. But they are acting in a very gentlemanly
manner, considering the circumstances.''
   Earlier Thursday, the Bank of England outlined a special
settlements procedure to ease payments on foreign exchange dealings
involving Drexel's British unit.
   The British central bank said that Drexel's trading clients may
make all payments due to Drexel to the Bank of England until
Tuesday. The bank said it would hold the money until it was
satisfied that Drexel had paid the clients the counter-value.
   This arrangement is stopgap measure to avoid liquidity problems
stemming from market reaction to Drexel's bankruptcy filing in the
United States.

<HEAD>Federated-Allied Say Sales Down First Two Months</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federated and Allied retailing companies
will see lower sales for the first two months of this year but are
committed to surviving their bankruptcy reorganizations intact,
their managers say.
   ``We're going to have a very poor fourth quarter,'' James M.
Zimmerman, president and chief operating officer of Federated
Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp., said Thursday.
   Sales for the 260 stores that Federated and Allied operate in 28
states were up 3 percent in December from the previous year, but
declined 9 percent in January and are down 4 percent this month,
Zimmerman said. He declined to be more specific.
   January sales figures will be released March 5, while
fourth-quarter and year-end results are to be released to creditors
and the public May 3, company spokeswoman Carol Sanger said. The
Federated-Allied fiscal year ended Feb. 3.
   Federated and Allied could emerge from their Chapter 11
reorganizations in as soon as eight months, said G. William Miller,
the former U.S. Treasury secretary hired Jan. 16 as chairman and
chief executive officer of Federated Stores Inc., the newly created
parent of Federated and Allied.
   The two retailers, owned by Canada's Campeau Corp., filed Jan.
15 for protection from creditors, listing $7.7 billion in debts.
   Miller, addressing reporters with Zimmerman and new
Federated-Allied chairman Allen I. Questrom, said his optimistic
projection could occur if Federated and Allied develop
reorganization plans within the 120 days they are allowed, and
creditors and the U.S. Bankruptcy Court give quick approval.
   But Miller said, ``I don't promise you that that's possible or
even feasible.''
   Miller said he would like to keep Federated and Allied intact
and not sell off divisions, because he thinks doing so would reduce
their value for creditors. Zimmerman said management is
reconsidering the previously proposed sale of Federated's New
York-based Bloomingdale's store division, to evaluate whether
Bloomingdale's would be more valuable to retain.
   Miller described Federated and Allied as viable and profitable,
but said they must adjust the staggering debts amassed when the
parent Campeau Corp. of Toronto acquired Allied in 1986 and
Federated in 1988.
   ``The capital structure is what's broke, and is what brings us
here today,'' Zimmerman said.
   The Chapter 11 filings have noticeably hurt confidence of
customers and merchandise suppliers. Federated and Allied are now
receiving about 85 percent of the merchandise ordered, compared
with about 25 percent the week prior to the Jan. 15 filing,
Zimmerman said.
   The bankruptcy court's approval Feb. 9 of $700 million in
debtor-in-possession financing and $1.7 billion in credit
facilities for receiving goods provided a critical boost for the
two companies, Questrom said.
   Questrom, lured away from Neiman-Marcus Feb. 2 with a five-year
contract that will pay him $1.2 million annually, said Federated
and Allied face a challenge in trying to maintain market shares
against financially healthy competitors.
   He said he will focus on drawing back more of Federated and
Allied's vendors and in adjusting merchandise inventories to keep
customers coming in.
   Zimmerman said he expects no across-the-board layoffs among the
combined 100,000 Federated and Allied employees. The companies have
suffered no major employee losses because of the Chapter 11
filings, but need to work on retaining employees, Questrom said.

   Paper products manufacturer Kimberly-Clark Corp.
has appointed a new head for the board of director's executive
committee, putting him in line to take over the company when its
chairman retires.
   Wayne R. Sanders, 42, also was named to the newly created
position of president of world consumer, nonwoven and service and
industrial operations.
   For now, Sanders also will continue as president of the personal
care sector and have additional responsibility for certain
corporate administrative functions, the company said Thursday.
   The company's current chairman, 63-year-old Darwin E. Smith,
retires in two years.
   All but two of the operating divisions will report to Sanders,
the Dallas-based company said. Sanders will remain based in
Wisconsin, where much of the company's operations are located to
help oversee a $2 billion capital expenditure program.
   Kimberly-Clark also announced two other executive changes it
said were part of its ``continuing plan for management succession
and development.''
   James D. Bernd, 56, president of the household products sector,
was named to the board and its executive committee. Claudio X.
Gonzalez, 55, a board member and head of the company's Mexican
affiliate, was named to the executive committee.
   Last year, Kimberly-Clark sold $5.7 billion worth of Kleenex,
disposable diapers, paper towels, health care products, newsprint
and other specialty paper items.

<HEAD>Trade Creditors May Get Paid, Bond Holders Won't Get All They're
Owed</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Executives of Federated Department Stores Inc.
and Allied Stores Corp. say their goal is to repay the full amount
owed to trade creditors.
   But bondholders who financed Campeau Corp.'s takeovers of the
two retailing companies will have to forgive some of the $7.7
billion debt listed in the bankruptcy petition filed Jan. 15 by
Federated and Allied, they said.
   ``It is clear that some of that (debt) will not be
decapitalized,'' G. William Miller, chairman of parent company
Federated Stores Inc., said Thursday. ``Some of it will have to
disappear, permanently.
   ``For those who hold the debt, the market is no longer there ...
We want them to get a reasonable recovery.''
   Miller, Federated-Allied Chairman Allen Questrom, and President
James Zimmerman read prepared statements Thursday to reporters and
representatives of Federated-Allied's largest creditors.
   They built on the theme that Federated and Allied, which operate
260 stores in 28 states, are close to returning to business as
usual and expect to be profitable.
   They also acknowledged that mistakes were made in financing the
acquisition of Allied in 1986 and Federated in 1988 by
Toronto-based Campeau, and in operating the stores the past two
years.
   Zimmerman said that by September 1989, it was evident that
Federated and Allied could not meet their debt payments and that
major financial restructuring was necessary.
   But he said the decision to file for protection from creditors
under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Act wasn't made until January,
and then primarily to prevent further erosion in the value of the
businesses.
   ``There was no plot to deceive any creditors,'' Zimmerman said.
``There was no grand scheme in Toronto or elsewhere to trick
anybody.''
   ``These are quality companies ... companies of this caliber do
not belong in Chapter 11,'' he said. ``We regret that any of our
creditors were left holding the bag with checks that did not clear
prior to our filing.
   Questrom was vice chairman of Federated Department Stores when
it was acquired by Campeau. He said he left because of reservations
_ ``as have been so tragically confirmed since'' _ about the parent
company's ability to handle the debt it had assumed.
   He subsequently became president of Nieman-Marcus, but returned
earlier this month _ for a guaranteed $10 million _ to find a
company ``that deserved better than what it was getting, better
than what had been inherited in the wake of two massive retail
takeovers, inordinate organizational changes and months of
debilitating uncertainty,'' he said.
   Miller, a former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, said he assumed
leadership last month of the parent company, Campeau (U.S.), on
condition that it be renamed and assured autonomy, distancing
itself from Robert Campeau, the Canadian real estate developer who
engineered the junk bond-financed takeovers of Allied and Federated.
   Although creditors were invited to hear the presentations by the
Federated-Allied officers, no questions were permitted by the U.S.
Trustee who conducted the meeting. At a news conference following
the meeting, officers refused to discuss specifics about
reorganization.
   Zimmerman acknowledged that some stores will be closed, perhaps
``a handful of stores across the country,'' but said he expects no
across-the-board layoffs.
   Miller said it was premature to sketch a reorganization plan
publicly.
   ``I would prefer to bring out a comprehensive plan where I can
make sure all the pieces fit and all the wheels mesh and that it
turns smoothly rather than feed out ideas before they have been
researched, before they have been discussed with the other side,''
Miller said.
   Miller said Federated-Allied still have three months to file
their plan with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
   The Federated group includes Bloomingdale's (17 stores) and
Abraham and Straus (15), both based in New York; Burdine's (30) of
Miami; Lazarus (44) of Cincinnati; and Rich's (26) of Atlanta.
   The Allied group includes The Bon Marche (40 stores) of Seattle;
Jordan Marsh (26) of Boston; Maas Brothers (38) of Tampa; and
Stern's (24) of Paramus, N.J.

<TEXT>
   Domino's Pizza Inc. tried to cut down on
legal actions last year by giving its delivery people driving
instruction, but the safety effort also helped steer profits down
16.4 percent.
   The Ann Arbor-based company also said launching a new product,
pan pizza, led to a drop in 1989 profits to $5.1 million, compared
with net income of $6.1 million in 1988.
   Domino's has been the defendant in a series of legal actions
blaming traffic accidents on drivers rushing to meet the 30-minute
pizza delivery deadline. The company said costs come out of store
budgets and not drivers' pockets.
   A videotaped driver-training program was instituted in 1989.
   The privately held company's 5,200 stores, two-thirds of them
owned by about 800 franchisees, sold an estimated 250 million
pizzas in 1989, Domino's President Dave Black said.
   Systemwide sales rose 9.6 percent to $2.5 billion, compared with
$2.3 billion in 1988, and Domino's corporate revenue rose 9 percent
to $1.14 billion from $1.05 billion a year earlier, the company
said.

<HEAD>Castle Announces Dole Foods Spinoff, Fourth Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Castle &amp; Cooke Inc. intends to separate its
Dole Food Co. Inc. from its real estate operations, officials
announced the day they released year-end earnings showing an 18
percent drop from 1988.
   Castle &amp; Cooke noted that its earnings the prior year had
included a $17.9 million pretax gain on the sale of Amfac Inc.
common stock. The fully diluted year-end earnings showed a 6.2
percent loss, excluding the 1988 investment gain, according to
information released Thursday.
   Castle's real estate development business reported higher
earnings, while its Dole food business was hurt by imported fruit
bans and strike-related costs.
   The conglomerate's 1989 fourth-quarter earnings were $23.8
million, or 40 cents a share, on revenue of $700 million. That
compares with earnings of $19.3 million, or 33 cents a share
including the investment gain, on revenue of $588.8 million during
the same period in 1988.
   Under the proposed spinoff, stockholders would receive an
additional share of Dole for each share of Castle held, the company
said in a statement. Castle &amp; Cooke would continue to be listed on
the New York and Pacific stock exchanges, and an application is
being made to list Dole on the same exchanges.
   The planned spinoff of Dole probably will occur in May or June,
pending a favorable federal tax ruling and other governmental
approvals, Castle said. Castle said it anticipates the tax ruling
will enable the spinoff to be tax free to Castle and its
shareholders.
   ``By separating into two companies, the management of each will
be able to adopt strategies and pursue objectives appropriate to
its specific business,'' said David H. Murdock, Castle's chairman
and chief executive.
   Under the proposal, Murdock will be chairman and chief executive
of both companies.
   Castle plans to retain all of its developed and undeveloped real
estate holdings, including its approximately 98 percent ownership
of the Hawaiian island of Lana'i, and all of its developments in
California and Arizona. Its headquarters will be in Honolulu.
   Dole will be a food products company, incorporated in Hawaii,
with headquarters in Los Angeles and Honolulu.
   Castle &amp; Cooke reported 1989 earnings of $94.9 million, or $1.60
a share, on revenue of $2.7 billion.
   That compares to 1988 fully diluted earnings of $100.8 million,
or $1.90 a share excluding the Amfac stock sale, on revenue of $2.4
billion. Including the investment gain, net income in 1988 was
$112.3 million, or $2.05 per share.
   Dole's 1989 earnings were hurt by the temporary ban on the sale
of Chilean fruit in early 1989, and by strike-related costs and
reduced prices in Dole's fresh vegetables group. Dole also incurred
start-up costs related to the introduction of new fruit juice
products in the United States and Japan.

<HEAD>Nike Accuses L.A. Gear of Copying Design of Air Jordan Shoe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nike Inc. officials said they weren't
flattered when they first saw L.A. Gear Inc.'s MVP-1 shoe, which
they maintain is an imitation of their popular Air Jordan
basketball shoe.
   Nike filed suit against L.A. Gear in U.S. District Court here on
Thursday, maintaining that L.A. Gear copied the Air Jordan design.
   The suit alleging patent infringement and unfair competition
also contends L.A. Gear copied the Nike-style sole for the MVP-1
and five other shoes.
   ``Imitation can be a form of flattery but this crosses the
line,'' said Lindsay Stewart, an attorney for the Beaverton,
Ore.-based Nike, the nation's top athletic shoemaker ahead of
Reebok and No. 3 L.A. Gear.
   Gil N. Schwartzberg, chief administrative officer for L.A. Gear,
denied the company copied Nike designs. He speculated Nike's
lawsuit may be motivated by L.A. Gear's aggressive entry into the
men's shoe market.
   ``When you're talking about basketball shoes they all look
somewhat similar to one another,'' he said. ``There are a lot of
shoes out there that look a lot more like the Air Jordan, but we're
the one they sue.''
   The Air Jordan is among Nike's top-selling shoes, generating $45
million in revenue for Nike since September 1988. It is named after
Chicago Bulls superstar Michael Jordan.
   ``The Air Jordan is consistently the product we're concerned
about,'' Stewart said. ``It is our bread and butter product. We
really feel it is the backbone of our basketball shoe line and it
is a big issue to us.''
   Stewart said the Air Jordan has distinctive design features,
including use of colors and materials.
   ``It's our contention that the MVP-1 incorporated most if not
all of those distinctive features and they've done that to our
disadvantage,'' Stewart said.
   He said Nike will seek substantial damages not yet undetermined.

   The Oldsmobile Division of General Motors
Corp. said it was making rare price cuts of as much as $500 on the
price of two of its models in an unusual attempt to spur sales in a
sluggish auto market.
   While the nation's Big Three automakers all have incentives in
effect to boost sales that have slumped since the model year began
in October, Oldsmobile spokesman Gus Buenz said he didn't believe
the others had cut base prices this year.
   ``As far as I know, this is the first time that I can recall
that GM has, and certainly Oldsmobile, reduced prices in the model
year,'' he said. ``Normally, when it occurs, it is at the
introduction of a new model year.''
   ``It's certainly not the trend. It is unusual,'' PaineWebber
Inc. of New York analyst Ann Knight said. ``It's not unprecedented.
It's done when the models are slow. The sales on those models have
been weak.''
   Increasingly in recent years, GM, Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler
Corp. have offered cash rebates to buyers and other incentives to
dealers to stimulate car sales.
   The increasing reliance on incentives has led some industry
analysts lately to suggest that Detroit was simply pricing its cars
too high.
   While the automakers might prefer price cuts to incentives,
Knight said she was unsure if other companies would follow
Oldsmobile's lead.
   ``I think companies would like to have price reductions instead
of incentives. A price cut is more disciplined a relief. But
incentives are so popular _ Americans love bargains,'' Knight said.
``It's the way Americans like to shop.''
   As the 1990 model year began last fall, West German automakers
Volkswagen AG and BMW cut prices on some of their cars, retreating
from the rebate wars.
   As of Feb. 16, the price of Oldsmobile's Ciera S coupe drops
$200 to $12,195, while the Ciera S sedan's price drops $500 to
$12,495.
   ``If you take $200 off the base or offer a $200 rebate on the
car, it's the same for the customer. But, the customer can start
with a lower price when he's bargaining with the dealer,'' Buenz
said.
   The price cuts have no effect on the current incentives on the
models that factories are offering to car dealers. Buenz refused to
disclose the amounts of the incentives.
   Cutlass Ciera S sales comprise 12 percent of total Oldsmobile
sales, which totalled 163,208 between Oct. 1 and Feb. 10, the
current model year.
   Earlier Thursday, GM said its earnings fell 50 percent in the
fourth quarter of 1989 to $700.2 million from $1.4 billion in the
last three months of 1988.

<HEAD>More Borrowing Amid Reports of Layoffs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financial troubles sent the Bank of New England
Corp. to the Federal Reserve Bank to borrow money again amid
reports the bank is ready to cut its workforce by some 5,500
employees.
   Bank spokesman Thomas Lavelle said the latest borrowing for the
region's largest bank was ``on target with expectations.''
   The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston Thursday reported loans
totaling $931 million to member banks this week, compared with $723
million the week before.
   ``Certainly the finger does point at Bank of New England,'' said
James Moynihan, senior vice president at Advest Inc.
   The Boston Globe today reported that bank sources confirmed the
bank is expected to announce a massive reduction plan that would
layoff some 2,500 employees and trim as many as 3,000 other
employees through attrition and the sale of various subsidiaries.
Bank officials did not immediately return calls this morning
seeking confirmation of the move.
   The reductions, expected to be announced next week when the bank
releases its 1989 financial statement, could have one-third of the
bank's 17,500 employees off the payroll by the end of April, the
newspaper said.
   A spokeswoman for the bank declined comment, the Globe said.
   Bank of New England, which had estimated losses exceeding $1
billion in 1989 because of bad real estate loans, has seen
depositors withdraw millions of dollars.
   The bank has acknowledged that during the past few weeks it has
sought help at the Federal Reserve Bank, considered to be the
lender of last resort.
   The bank has been trying to raise cash by selling off $6 billion
worth of assets. As of Thursday, the bank had sold or has
agreements to sell $2.7 billion in assets, Lavelle said.
   The bank also announced Thursday it had reached an agreement to
sell $1 billion of its loan portfolio to the Canadian Imperial Bank
of Commerce.
   ``A lot of deals have not closed yet,'' Moynihan said,
explaining the bank's persistent cash crunch. ``My guess was you
might see them at this level.''
   The bank might be feeling increased pressure from customers who
held large certificates of deposit, exceeding the insured amount of
$100,000, that have now reached their maturity dates, analysts said.
   Many of those certificates are bought on 90-day cycles, which
means they were purchased prior to the recent gloomy disclosures
about Bank of New England.
   These large depositors can be expected to transfer their money
to other banks when the certificates reach maturity, Moynihan said.
   Bank of New England said it was selling assets from its
Communications Lending Group, whose portfolio includes loans to
companies in the U.S. communications and media industries.
   Canadian Imperial, one of the 10 largest banks in North America,
will acquire the loans in stages, with payments planned to begin
this month and to be completed by April 30.
   The loans acquired by Canadian Imperial are being sold at face
value, meaning ``there's no gain on this,'' Lavelle said.
   But analysts say until Bank of New England's finances become
more stable, the bank's priority is to raise cash.
   ``The sale of this portion of our loan portfolio is a major
component of our asset sales plan,'' H. Ridgely Bullock, the bank's
interim chairman, said in a statement. ``It will significantly
bolster our liquidity and improve our capital ratios.''

   The stock market staged a moderate advance today
in response to better-than-expected news on international trade.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 7.43 to 2,656.98
by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 680 up, 467 down and
527 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 52.72 million shares at
midmorning.
   The Commerce Department reported that the nation's trade deficit
shrank to $7.17 billion in December from $10.29 billion the month
before.
   That came as a pleasant surprise to forecasters, who had
generally been expecting the gap between imports and exports to be
about $9 billion.
   But analysts said traders remained leery of chasing after the
recent upswing in stock prices.
   Fears persist that a rise in worldwide interest rates so far in
1990 might have increased the chances of a recession and a
continuing slump in corporate profits.
   Hewlett-Packard fell 2 to 45\. The company reported earnings for
its fiscal quarter ended Jan. 31 of 72 cents a share, down from 83
cents in the comparable period a year earlier.
   Gainers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, up | at 104&rsqb;; United Technologies, up &rsqb; at 51}; General
Electric, up { at 63&lsqb;, and Exxon, up &rsqb; at 48~.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose

index was up .33 at 359.93.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly
lower in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, with
soybeans leading the way amid profit-taking.
   Soybeans for near-term delivery fell about 2 cents within
minutes of the opening after climbing more than 4 cents Thursday in
response to an active European market.
   Analysts said this morning's decline reflected both a weaker
European soybean market and disappointment that soybean futures
failed to follow through on Thursday's rally on a strictly
technical basis when trading opened this morning.
   Some of this morning's overall weakness was seen as
profit-taking and position-evening ahead of the three-day weekend.
The markets will be closed Monday for Presidents' Day.
   In early trading, wheat futures prices were { cent to 1 cent

<HEAD>Former Steel Exec Trying to Loosen Aluminum's Hold on Can Industry</HEAD>
<HEAD>Graphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEN KUSMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Steel industry veteran Tim Moran believes he
can loosen aluminum's grip on the beverage can industry with a less
expensive steel container that has won enthusiastic approval from
Pepsi and Coke.
   But if Moran and the steel industry are to penetrate aluminum's
96 percent share of the market, the key may not necessarily be in
pricing their product but recycling it.
   ``If cost were the only factor, the potential switch from
aluminum to steel would be greater,'' said Harold Sohn, an official
at Ball Corp., a leading can producer based in Muncie, Ind.
   The aluminum can, he said, ``really is an environmentally sound
package, and brewers and soft drink manufacturers want to be in
that kind of package.''
   The steel industry recognizes the need to recycle, and has
formed the Steel Can Recycling Institute. Moran also recognizes
that need, and created a recycling division within his 2-year-old
company, Bev-Pak Inc.
   The 43-year-old Pittsburgh native left as general manager of the
tin plate division of USX Corp. in 1987 to form Bev-Pak, which
began production a year ago at Monticello in northwest Indiana, one
of the world's largest steel-producing regions.
   Moran had seen the two-piece aluminum can slowly replace the
three-piece steel product while the aluminum industry built a
recycling infrastructure so efficient that today more than half its
cans come back as scrap. Aluminum, which in 1964 accounted for only
2 percent of the beverage can market, had half of it by 1977 and
reached 92 percent in 1983.
   In 1988, the last year for which the Can Manufacturers Institute
has complete figures, aluminum accounted for 77.9 billion of the
81.2 billion beverage cans produced in this country.
   The price of aluminum cans has risen with its market share, and
the cost advantage of steel had reached as much as $8 per 1,000
cans when Bev-Pak was starting out.
   Still, Moran sensed skepticism.
   ``Bev-Pak comes on the scene, builds a $100 million steel can
plant, and the industry can't believe it,'' Moran said.
   His 200-employee plant can produce 1,600 cans per minute, or 2
billion cans per year. That represents half the total steel
beverage can output in this country.
   Moran's customer base stretches around the key industrial cities
of the Midwest. Soft-drink giants PepsiCo Inc. and Coca-Cola Co.,
leading users of cans, supported him from the start _ he considers
them the ``core advocates that were the base of the business'' _
and beer brewers are starting to show interest. Bev-Pak recently
added a line to produce cans for Miller Brewing Co.
   ``There is a place in the market for Bev-Pak. We've got major,
billion-dollar companies watching us,'' Moran said.
   Moran estimates 20 percent of his cans are recycled, some
collected through a Bev-Pak division called Recycle Indiana
Resources. It draws upon a network of 400 recyclers in Indiana,
Ohio and northern Illinois, operates 11 recycling trailers around
Indianapolis and runs motor routes in other Indiana and Ohio cities.
   The two-piece steel can, with its aluminum top, is nearly
identical to the all-aluminum can but slightly heavier.
   ``They're both so light today that it's almost impossible for
the consumer to tell the difference,'' said Sal Porrazzo, director
of environmental affairs for PepsiCo Inc.
   The competition between the two metals is fundamental to keeping
prices down, Porrazzo said. Pepsi is using steel for 10 percent to
12 percent of its can packaging, he said.
   The steel can is produced at a lower cost because steel is
cheaper than aluminum, but that factor becomes a negative in
recycling. Where aluminum cans can fetch about 50 cents a pound,
steel is closer to 10 cents or less.
   ``We certainly want to be in environmentally sound packaging,''
Porrazzo said. ``The issue that comes up is, are steel cans
recyclable?
   ``When you get to consumer recycling aspects, there's a value
difference that singles steel out as not being recyclable because
it is not as valuable,'' Porazzo said. ``You shouldn't penalize a
package just because its recycled value is not as high.''
   Sohn, director of industrial affairs for Ball's Denver-based
Package Products Groups, said aluminum's market domination was
based on recyclability.
   Ball in 1973 opened a beverage can plant in Findlay, Ohio, with
two steel lines, but converted one to aluminum by the mid-1980s.
When it opened a new plant in Conroe, Texas, in 1987, it had one
steel line and one aluminum. Its other five beverage can plants
produce only aluminum cans, Sohn said.
   ``We make what the customer wants. We don't force something on
them. Clearly, there's been a preference over the years for the
aluminum, because of its recyclability and recycling weight,'' Sohn
said.
   Customer interest in steel is growing, and the chances of steel
regaining a greater share of the market are strong if aluminum
prices remain high and steel gets its recycling program off the
ground, Sohn said.
   The nation's top steel producers established the Steel Can
Recycling Institute in 1988. Steel is the most recycled material in
the world, and institute figures show twice as much steel was
recycled in this country from 1979-88 than all other recycled
materials combined.
   However, consumers weren't getting the message.
   ``It is fair to say the industry has not done a very good job of
telling people they had a recycling infrastructure in place,'' said
Elizabeth Olenbush, the institute's director of marketing.

<HEAD>1989 Trade Deficit Smallest in Five Years</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts grafs 5-7, But the Bush, with comment. This also

<TEXT>
   The U.S. trade deficit, aided by a dramatic 30
percent improvement in December, narrowed to $108.58 billion last
year to post the smallest yearly imbalance since 1984, the
government reported today.
   While economists were pleasantly surprised by the $7.17 billion
December deficit, they were unimpressed by the modest decline for
the year.
   The 8.4 percent decline in the annual deficit, down from $118.53
billion in 1988, represented a sharp slowing in the pace of
improvement. The deficit had dropped 22.1 percent in 1988.
   Many economists are forecasting that the country's trade
performance could actually worsen this year after two years of
improvements as America's dependence on foreign oil grows to record
highs and consumers' appetite for foreign goods shows little sign
of slackening.
   But the Bush administration hailed the new trade figures as an
indication that the improvement evident since 1988 was not in
danger of stalling out.
   Commerce Undersecretary Michael Darby noted that U.S. exports
were up 13 percent, outpacing a 7.3 percent rise in imports.
   ``Growth in exports was strong across most categories of goods,
including ... a wide variety of manufactured goods, especially
machinery and telecommunications equipment,'' he said.
   As usual, the country's largest imbalance in 1989 was with
Japan, a $49 billion deficit that accounted for 45 percent of the
total.
   Another big part of the deficit came from oil imports, which
surged 27.2 percent in 1989 to $48.94 billion. It was the highest
yearly total since a $52.4 billion foreign oil bill in 1984.
   One of the primary reasons analysts are looking for little or no
improvement in the trade deficit this year is a belief that U.S.
dependence on foreign oil will continue to grow. The American
Petroleum Institute reported that imports reached an all-time
record of 54 percent of total demand in January while domestic
production fell to its lowest level in a quarter-century.
   The December deficit of $7.17 billion was the lowest monthly
imbalance since a $6.79 billion deficit in December 1984.
   The 30 percent improvement from November's $10.29 billion
deficit occurred because exports rose 2.4 percent to $31.11
billion, the second-highest level on record, while imports fell 5.9
percent to $38.28 billion.
   The trade deficit is the difference between imports and exports.
   For December, the $3.1 billion improvement represented a big
jump in American exports of aircraft, reflecting the end of the
Boeing strike, and smaller increases in office equipment, artwork
and antiques and industrial machinery.
   The decline in imports in December represented in part a $300
million decline in oil shipments, which reflected a drop in volume
that offset a rise in price.
   The Bush administration is counting on a continued improvement
in the trade deficit this year to dampen protectionist sentiment in
Congress and to spur overall economic growth.
   However, many private forecasters are predicting that the
deficit will begin rising this year, reflecting slower growth in
U.S. exports and the higher foreign oil bill.
   ``It is pretty fundamental that we are not competitive in world
trade,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co. ``If
Americans won't buy American goods, there is no reason to expect
the rest of the world to do so.''
   For 1989, exports climbed 13 percent to an all-time high of
$364.35 billion. Imports also reached a record high of $472.93
billion, up 7.3 percent from 1988.
   The $49 billion deficit with Japan was down slightly from a
$51.8 billion imbalance in 1988. Other large deficits occurred with
Taiwan, $13 billion; Canada, $9.62 billion; and China, $6.18
billion.
   One of the biggest surpluses was with the Soviet Union, with
U.S. exports exceeding Soviet imports by $3.57 billion.

<HEAD>Vuitton Family to Purchase Lanvin Couture House</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An investment group led by the Vuitton family
launched a buyout of the famed Lanvin couture house Friday,
announcing it plans to buy 95 percent of the company's shares.
   The Orcofi investment group said it wants to buy the shares from
the French subsidiary of the British bank Midland, with the goal of
jointly controlling Lanvin with the L'Oreal SA cosmetics firm.
   L'Oreal is the world's largest cosmetics company.
   Leon Bressler, who joined Lanvin in September after working for
Midland Bank SA, will be retained as Lanvin's chairman, Orcofi said
in a press statement.
   Bressler said last year that a takeover was expected, allowing
Midland to take a profit and invest in other areas.
   Lanvin posted losses of the equivalent of $17.5 million in 1988
but earned a $53 million profit under 1989 restructuring.
   The house, founded in 1890 by Jeanne Lavin, retained
ready-to-wear designer Claude Montana last year to run its haute
couture department but his first collection drew boos from fashion
critics in January.
   Orcofi holds an 85.5 percent stake in Vuitton Investissement
Gestion, the conduit for most of the Vuitton family's holding in
the luxury conglomerate Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessey (LVMH).
   The purchase of the Lanvin stake follows investments by Orcofi
in other luxury-goods companies, including the leather tannery
Gordon-Choisy SA and Luxury Stores Investment, an international
distribution concern.
   The Vuitton family has been at odds with Bernard Arnault, who
shares control with Guinness PLC in Jacques Rober SA, a holding
company with a 45 percent stake in LVMH shares.
   Arnault has said on several occastions that he would like to
oust Henry Racamier, who represents the Vuitton family in LVMH,
from Louis Vuitton SA, the baggage and leather goods maker.
   The dispute has repeatedly delayed the group's annual meeting
and LVMH hasn't yet produced confirmed revenue figures for 1989.

   Drexel Burnham Lambert, the pioneering Wall
Street firm that abruptly collapsed last week, met disaster in the
same go-it-alone style that once had brought so much success.
   During the glory years of the ``junk'' bond market it helped
create, Drexel stamped itself as a maverick operation driven by
aggressiveness and innovation.
   Then, after the firm's fortunes took a severe downward turn, few
allies from either Wall Street or Washington stood ready to come to
the rescue.
   So Drexel's transformation within a matter of months from the
fifth largest firm in the securities business to Chapter 11
bankruptcy was widely described as a classic tale of ``live by the
sword, die by the sword'' capitalism.
   ``It was a typical example of Wall Street excess,'' as one
veteran analyst put it. ``You get something good and you push it
until it blows up.''
   Five years ago, Drexel seemed anything but a doomed business.
Led by superstar financier Michael Milken, it dominated the market
for high-yield, lower-quality bonds used to raise money for
corporations of less than ``blue chip'' standing, and later to
finance a boom in corporate takeovers and buyouts.
   By last week, though, all of Drexel's good fortune had run out.
Milken was gone as part of a December 1988 agreement between the
firm and the federal government to settle charges of fraud, and
Drexel faced a host of other legal battles.
   Competitors had started gaining on it even as the junk-bond game
was cooling. The woes of the ``junk'' market intensified late last
summer when a deal in which Drexel played no part _ Campeau Corp.'s
acquisition of Federated Department Stores and Allied Stores _ went
sour.
   Finally, Drexel began to look in desperation for a merger
partner or other source of outside capital, but found no takers.
Regulators, after inspecting the firm on the brink of failure,
declined to intervene.
   In no small measure, observers say, Drexel fell victim to its
own success, the commotion it created, and maybe even the envy it
aroused.
   As a prominent force behind the debt-financed buyout boom,
Drexel had come to be seen as ``a source of aggravation and
frustration'' to many government officials, said Lawrence
Eckenfelder, an analyst who follows the securities industry for the
rival house of Prudential-Bache Securities.
   Furthermore, he noted, because Drexel previously had disposed of
the part of its brokerage business that dealt with the public,
``you didn't have a sense that the consumer had to be protected.''
   The hunt for a merger partner, meanwhile, was severely hampered
by the specter of Drexel's legal problems. ``That was probably the
major thing that scared everybody away,'' Eckenfelder said.
   If Drexel once thrived as a seemingly indispensible part of the
junk-bond business, it expired because it became ``irrelevant,'' in
the view of Charles Vincent, a financial-services analyst at the
Provident National Bank in Philadelphia.
   ``The junk-bond market no longer depended on Drexel, and they
weren't doing anything outside of that that was unique on Wall
Street,'' Vincent said.
   ``No one depended on them. Their failure represented no threat
to financial stability.''
   Such businesslike appraisals, of course, were cold comfort to
the 5,000 Drexel employees left to cast about for other employment
in an industry job market that has been tightening ever since the
1987 crash in stock prices.
   Drexel's other likely legacy, most observers agree, is a lasting
role for junk bonds as a capital-raising tool in business _ though
perhaps never again to the extent that they were used, or abused,
over the last few years.
   ``I'm sure Drexel rubbed people the wrong way,'' said one
analyst who declined to be identified. ``But I think it was more
jealousy than anger. Any other firm on the Street, given half the
chance, would have done the same thing.''
   Said Eckenfelder: ``It was scary in a way to see how quickly
they could fall.''

<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. will
produce computer memory chips for the international market under a
joint venture with Mitsubishi Electric Corp. of Japan, the
companies announced.
   The five-year agreement between Mitsubishi and AT&amp;T
Microelectronics, an AT&amp;T division based in Berkeley Heights, N.J.,
involves technology sharing, worldwide marketing and manufacturing
of SRAM microchips, company officials said Thursday.
   SRAM is an acronym for static random access memory, a type of
computer memory chip that stores information as long as the power
to the computer is maintained. SRAMs are used in computer
workstations, advanced personal computers, super minicomputers and
telecommunications equipment.
   Mitsubishi will provide design and engineering expertise for the
chips, which will be made at AT&amp;T's Orlando semiconductor plant.
   This is the first time AT&amp;T has teamed up with a Japanese
company in the semiconductor business, said company officials, who
refused to disclose terms of the multimillion-dollar deal.
   AT&amp;T hopes the venture will enhance the company's efforts to
sell chips on the international market, officials said.
   ``Our goal is to rapidly increase sales worldwide to
original-equipment manufacturers,'' William J. Warwick, president
of AT&amp;T Microelectronics, said in a statement.
   Preliminary work on the SRAM chip already has begun in Orlando,
said Mary Lou Ambrus, a spokeswoman for AT&amp;T Microelectronics
   Last month, International Business Machines Corp. and Siemens AG
of West Germany announced a joint venture to develop advanced
computer memory chips.

<HEAD>Saratoga Mineral Water Hoping To Reap Benefits Of Perrier Recall</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Will Perrier's fizzle become
Saratoga's bubbles?
   If experts' predictions hold out, the recall of Perrier's
popular mineral water could be a boon to smaller competitors, such
as the Saratoga Springs Mineral Water Co.
   It's too early to tell if Saratoga Mineral Water will capture
some of the market dominated by the chic French brand. But initial
signs are sparkling, say officials at Evian Waters of France Inc.,
the parent company of the Saratoga Springs firm.
   ``More distributors are calling and placing orders,'' said David
Daniel, Evian's chief executive officer. ``It's busier than what
you'd normally expect.''
   Source Perrier SA recalled its water from worldwide distribution
this week after small amounts of a naturally occurring toxic gas
passed through a dirty filter and contaminated some bottles.
   Officials at Perrier's U.S. subsidiary have said they expect the
green bottles to be kept out of the United States for several
months.
   That will be a blow to Perrier, which built the U.S. sparkling
mineral water market nearly from scratch in the 1970s. Its Perrier
brand was the third biggest seller among all bottled water brands
and the leading imported brand sold in the United States in 1988,
accounting for 5.7 percent of the industry's $2.2 billion in sales,
according to Beverage Marketing Corp. in New York.
   It could mean big bucks for competitors.
   ``If competitors move quickly they'll benefit,'' said Hellen
Berry of Beverage Marketing.
   ``Perrier did a tremendous job getting into the market. But it's
going to be gone,'' Berry said. ``Something will have to fill the
void.''
   That something could be Saratoga Mineral Water, which plans to
launch a major new advertising campaign in the next few weeks.
   Daniel says the timing of the ad campaign and the Perrier recall
is just coincidence.
   ``They were primed to go on no matter what happened,'' Berry
said.
   Saratoga is no newcomer to the bottled water business. The
waters of Saratoga Springs have drawn visitors to this quaint town
for more than 200 years. According to folklore, George Washington
drank from the springs here.
   By the 1830s, a thriving social scene had grown up around the
springs. When Franklin Roosevelt was governor of New York, he
pushed the development several mineral water bath houses.
Roosevelt, a polio victim, was a regular user of the baths and
consumed the waters.
   Saratoga Mineral Water was first bottled in 1872 when the
then-Saratoga Vichy Co. developed a well near what is now the
Saratoga State Spa Park. The water came bubbling up from the ground
full of minerals and carbon dioxide percolated out of ancient
volcanic faults in the Adirondack Mountain foothills.
   Salt, bicarbonate of soda and artificial carbonation were added
to the spring water which was then bottled. It was a modest seller.
   The mineral water was eventually dropped in favor of a product
that was more competitive with its European counterparts.
   Saratoga Mineral Water is now sold in stores, restaurants and
bars in 23 states in the eastern half of the country.
   Daniel says the company is beginning to make a real push into
supermarkets, where the bulk of mineral water is sold. Perrier's
temporary absence may give Saratoga the edge it needs.
   ``Sales in bars and restaurants are good for your image. But
volume tends to be relatively small in relation to the volume you
can sell in major retail markets,'' Daniel said.
   Experts question whether the smaller bottled water companies are
strong enough to fill the temporary void left by Perrier.
   There are about 450 water bottling plants in the United States,
producing more than 600 different labels of drinking water, natural
water and spring water, according to Bevmark Inc., a Los
Angeles-based consulting firm. In addition, there are more than 50
brands of imported waters, Bevmark said.
   Berry said 1989 sales of Saratoga Mineral Water were greatly
improved over previous years but were still small compared to
Perrier's. She estimates last year's sales for Saratoga in the $10
million range. Perrier had sales in the United States of $150
million last year.
   Perrier officials say benzene, a chemical used in cleaning
solvents, entered its water in traces when workers failed to change
a pipe filter at the company's natural spring at Vergeze in
southern France.
   Earlier, Perrier had said it believed an employee mistakenly
used a product containing benzene to clean grease from one bottling
line.

   Shares finished higher after a quiet session
Friday on London's Stock Exchange, with the market able to hold on
to early-morning advances gained on the back of a strong
performance Thursday on Wall Street. Dealers said the market was
attempting to digest a barrage of long-awaited U.S. and British
economic reports released during Friday's session.
   ``The day's trading has been positive but subdued,'' one market
maker said. ``It was a good initial markup which seemed to hold its
own. There hasn't been a lot behind it.''
   By the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was up 12.1 points, or 0.5 percent, at 2,325.9, off its best level
of 2,334.4 but above its low for the day of 2,319.6.
   The Financial Times 30-share index rose 7.1 points to close at

   The stock market struggled to a small gain today
in a sluggish response to better-than-expected news on
international trade.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 4.28 to 2,653.83
by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 755 up, 616 down and
499 unchanged.
   The Commerce Department reported that the nation's trade deficit
shrank to $7.17 billion in December from $10.29 billion the month
before.
   That came as a pleasant surprise to forecasters, who had
generally been expecting the gap between imports and exports to be
about $9 billion.
   But analysts said traders remained leery of chasing after the
recent upswing in stock prices.
   Fears persist that a rise in worldwide interest rates so far in
1990 might have increased the chances of a recession and a
continuing slump in corporate profits.
   Hewlett-Packard fell 3| to 43| in active trading. The company
reported earnings for its fiscal quarter ended Jan. 31 of 72 cents

<HEAD>Georgia Gulf Turns Down Simmons' Buyout Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chemical maker Georgia Gulf Corp. on Friday
rejected a $1.1 billion buyout offer from Texas investor Harold C.
Simmons, saying the $45-a-share bid was too low.
   In a letter to shareholders, Georgia Gulf's board of directors
said they decided unanimously against the offer. The board called
it ``inadequate, coercive and too conditional.''
   The directors said shareholders would benefit more from the
proposed recapitalization announced earlier by Georgia Gulf.
   Officials at NL Industries Inc., the Houston company controlled
by Simmons that made the tender offer last month, could not be
reached immediately for comment Friday. NL President J. Landis
Martin did not return calls made to his office.
   ``In our view, NL's offer represents an attempt to take
advantage of the current vulnerability of the company resulting
from short-term economic and market conditions,'' said the Georgia
Gulf letter released Friday.
   ``We believe that the $45-per-share price offered by NL does not
reflect the kind of premium that ought to be received by the
company's stockholders in a transaction ... in which control of the
company would be sold,'' the letter said.
   Georgia Gulf's directors and officers own about 17 percent of
the company, while Simmons has about a 9.9 percent stake.
   NL, in its tender offer, also proposed replacing the Georgia
Gulf board.
   Georgia Gulf in January announced a proposed recapitalization of
the company designed to discouraged Simmons from launching a
takeover. The company valued the recapitalization, which has yet to
go before shareholders, at $55 a share and it was widely believed
the move would placate Simmons. The company did not say what the
recapitalization would involve.
   NL, however, launched its tender offer two weeks later, saying
the recapitalization probably would provide stockholders with less
than $45 a share.
   Georgia Gulf said Friday it has received bank notification that
no obstacles to financing the recapitalization have emerged so far.
Under a recapitalization, a company usually borrows a large sum of
money to fund a special dividend or an expansion.

<TEXT>
   Fiat, Italy's auto giant, announced Friday
that it has signed a preliminary accord to produce a mid-size car
in Poland.
   Fiat won the agreement after nearly three years of talks and
fierce competition with Japan's Daihatsu Motor Co. The dollar value
of the deal was not disclosed.
   A spokesman for Fiat, Italy's largest private-sector industrial
group, said production of cars, modeled after Fiat's popular Tipo
model, is expected to start in the early 1990s.
   The spokesman did not disclose further details of the agreement,
signed earlier this week at the Turin headquarters of Fiat with
Fabryka Somochodow Osobowych, Poland's state-owned auto company.
   The agreement will further strengthen Fiat's presence in Poland.
Fiat last year signed an agreement to produce 150,000 units a year
of a small-size model called the Micro.
   Also last year, Fiat, which is owned by the Agnelli family,
signed an agreement with the Soviet Union to produce in that
country a car modeled after Fiat's Panda model. The contract calls
for production of about 300,000 cars a year starting in 1993.

   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. is dying, not its
deals.
   Like bargain hunters at a garage sale, Wall Street's big
investment banks are sifting through the remnants of Drexel's
businesses and scrambling to sign up its clients.
   Drexel fired most of its 5,300 employees on Friday, keeping only
enough staff to wrap up pending deals or help transfer the business
to other firms.
   ``Half of these things were in midstream,'' said Michael Madden,
head of mergers and acquisitions at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.,
which picked up one large Drexel deal. ``Suddenly Drexel is without
the ability to get it done. The client says, `Whoops! What do I do
now?''
   Deals stuck in limbo since the Chapter 11 bankruptcy court
filing by Drexel's parent range from mergers to junk bond
underwritings. The prospective fees total in the millions.
   Top investment banks such as Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., Morgan Stanley
Group Inc., Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. and First Boston Corp. are all
angling for the business, industry executives said. With Wall
Street in a prolonged slump, Drexel's passing has been an
unexpected windfall for firms eager for some lucrative work.
   According to Securities Data Co., the dollar volume of mergers
and acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter of 1989 declined
36.6 percent from the same 1988 period.
   ``Because of the slowdown, it makes the battle to get Drexel's
primary clents all that more fearsome,'' said Perrin Long, who
follows the securities industry for Lipper Analytical Services.
   Executives from Mesa Petroleum Co. jetted in from Texas this
week and rode in limousines from investment bank to investment bank
to complete the transfer of a planned $350 million to $400 million
royalty trust offering that Drexel was supposed to manage.
   After losing to Drexel in the initial bidding to head the deal,
Shearson beat out Merrill Lynch for the Mesa offering, which would
create a royalty trust _ a legal vehicle to hold property _ on the
company's Hugoton and Panoma natural gas fields in Oklahoma and
Kansas.
   Mesa, which is headed by corporate raider T. Boone Pickens Jr.,
is offering a 32 percent stake in the fields to the public. The
offer had been registered with the Securities and Exchange
Commission for two weeks and was set to go ahead when Drexel fell.
   Drexel investment bankers have cooperated with the transition,
which focuses on marketing the issue _ 16 million units to be
priced between $22 and $25 each _ to institutional and retail
investors. Marketing was supposed to start Friday but has been
delayed.
   ``The Drexel guys were very cooperative,'' said Grant Porter,
who heads Shearson's natural resources coporate finance group.
``They worked long and hard on this transaction and it's a great
disappointment to them to have to step aside.''
   But he added: ``People are ready, willing and able to step into
the shoes of Drexel in these circumstances.''
   Despite a drought in new issues of junk bonds to raise money,
firms also are actively competing for about two dozen planned
Drexel offerings worth in the billions for companies such as Foods
4 Less Supermarkets Inc. and General Host Corp.
   Firms won't necessarily try to sell the new bonds to investors
immediately _there have been only two new junk-bond offerings so
far this year, according to Secrutiies Data. But they do plan to
get to know clients and strategy, analysts said.
   As in the Mesa offering, introducing corporate officials to a
new team of investment bankers is causing delays.
   ``It's like moving into a new home,'' Long said. ``You get up in
the middle of the night, you're bumping into things.''

   Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc.'s British units
took steps Friday to wind down their operations following the U.S.
parent company's bankruptcy petition Tuesday.
   Drexel officials were talking with various parties over the
possibility of selling the British operations in pieces, a company
official said.
   Meanwhile, KPMG Peat Marwick McLintock, the British arm of the
international accounting firm, on Friday was appointed by Britain's
High Court as administrator of Drexel Burnham Lambert Holding Ltd.,
a holding company for most of the London operations.
   It also was appointed administrator for two units, Drexel
Burnham Lambert Ltd., its metals, soft commodities and oil futures
trading arm, and Drexel Burnham Lambert Securities Ltd.
   These three companies filed petitions with the bankruptcy
section of the High Court earlier Friday.
   In filing the administrative petitions, Drexel essentially
sought the court's guidance in ascribing priorities to creditors or
claimants against its operations.
   Peat Marwick said its job would be ``to ensure that all
commitments'' with the three Drexel units ``are honored in full''
and that Drexel's clients are ``totally unaffected by events
occurring in other parts of the group.''
   James Furlong, a Drexel senior vice president in charge of
European-based equities trading, said his division was in talks
with three major institutions about the possibility of the
division's sale.
   He said he had no doubt that the staff would stay together.
   Furlong's staff of 60 trades in U.S. stocks and related
products. Drexel's non-U.S. stock trading business was curtailed
last year.
   The heads of Drexel's several European-based operations held
discussions in London for much of Friday, Furlong said. Strategies
emerging from the meetings suggest the divisions will attempt to
market themselves individually to prospective buyers, he said.
   For equities, the first option was to find a buyer for the whole
of the equities business outside the United States, comprising both
European and Asian operations with a total staff of 300, he said.
   The second option was to find a buyer for the European sales
staff alone. Furlong said that three institutions so far have shown
interest in this plan.
   There so far have been no resignations or defections from the
European team and morale was good, Furlong said.
   On Thursday, the Bank of England announced a special settlements
arrangement for foreign exchange trades involving Drexel in London
to prevent liquidity problems.
   Also Thursday, the London Clearing House, which is responsible
for clearing operations on the London Metal Exchange, International
Petroleum Exchange and several other markets, declared Drexel in
default of all its commodities futures business.

   The stock market was little changed today in a
sluggish response to better-than-expected news on international
trade.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped .68 to 2,648.87
by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 6 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 769 up, 640 down and
499 unchanged.
   The Commerce Department reported that the nation's trade deficit
shrank to $7.17 billion in December from $10.29 billion the month
before.
   That came as a pleasant surprise to forecasters, who had
generally been expecting the gap between imports and exports to be
about $9 billion.
   But analysts said traders remained leery of chasing after the
recent upswing in stock prices.
   Fears persist that a rise in worldwide interest rates so far in
1990 might have increased the chances of a recession and a
continuing slump in corporate profits.
   Hewlett-Packard fell 3&rsqb; to 43~ in active trading. The company
reported earnings for its fiscal quarter ended Jan. 31 of 72 cents
a share, down from 83 cents in the comparable period a year earlier.
   Texas Utilities was the volume leader, up &lsqb; at 35&lsqb;. The company
reported higher quarterly profits and increased its quarterly
dividend by a penny a share.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
.10 to 184.60. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was off .39 at 359.21.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 127.46 million shares with an

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed slightly
lower Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade, largely reflecting
profit-taking as traders evened up their positions ahead of the
long weekend.
   The Board of Trade will be closed Monday for Presidents Day.
   Additional selling in the wheat market was attributed to a lack
of significant new export businesses and to expectations that the
slow pace of export sales will continue next week.
   Wheat futures had risen earlier in the week in anticipation of a
bid by China for some of the 1 million metric tons of subsidized
wheat offered to it last week by the Agriculture Department, but
the Chinese business did not materialize.
   At the close, wheat futures were } cent to 2} cents lower with

<TEXT>
   A few short years after new Coke fizzled on the
marketplace, The Boston Globe is admitting that it, too,
underestimated human resistance to change.
   After the newspaper altered the format of its TV listings last
summer, its editors were deluged with calls and letters from
readers criticizing the changes. This week, as the paper
reintroduces the new old version of its TV Week, it is taking to
the airwaves with a series of tongue-in-cheek advertisements,
hoping to win back the disgruntled.
   ``It's a story about being misunderstood, and having the guts to
overcome it ... about being unwanted and unloved, and finding the
strength to change,'' the ad's narrator says.
   ```Refreshingly simple,' says the Boston Globe,'' the ad
continues. ``The Boston Globe calls it `This year's best revival.'
And the Boston Globe raves, `Now you can read it.'''
   Last June, the Globe altered the format of its weekly TV
listings to cut a few pages. The move, which saved ``a few hundred
thousand dollars,'' was part of a general belt-tightening, as
newspapers everywhere confronted lagging revenues, Globe spokesman
Richard Gulla said Friday.
   The earlier format featured a horizontal grid of shows scheduled
for prime time, as well as a `rolling log' that listed in narrative
form the day's schedule, with blurbs for some of the movies.
   After the changes, listings for the entire day were compiled in
a vertical grid, with the names of the channels heading the
columns. The type was smaller, there was no rolling log and no
blurbs explained the shows.
   ``Readers went bananas,'' Gulla said.
   More than 3,000 called in to express their outrage. Many readers
who called said the main reason they bought the Sunday Globe was
for the old TV Week, reported Robert L. Kierstead, the paper's
ombudsman. He wrote that one Boston man told him: ``If it wasn't
broken, why did you have to fix it?''
   ``Part of what it shows you is how much TV is a part of people's
lives,'' Gulla said.
   In October, the Globe put a questionnaire in a Sunday edition,
circulation 800,000, asking readers what they thought of the
changes. Over 37,000 responded in 17 days and nearly 90 percent of
them said they were not happy, Gulla said.
   ``It certainly was a mistake on our part,'' he said. ``We didn't
recognize how near and dear this was to people's hearts.''
   The Globe could have used a lesson from executives at the
Coca-Cola Co. In 1985, when the Atlanta-based company introduced
new Coke and stopped making the old formula, ``there was a consumer
outcry,'' said a Coke spokesman.
   ``Consumers were very specific and aggressive about telling us
that they wanted the old formula,'' said spokesman Randy Donaldson.
Three months later, old Coke was back on the shelves, this time
under the guise of Coca-Cola Classic.
   Unfortunately for the Globe, they couldn't simply release the
old product in a new can. It took eight months of surveys and focus
groups before the first edition of the new, old TV listings
returned to the newsstand. And like Coke Classic, the new product
is markedly similar to that of eight months ago.
   ``People were telling us `Don't mess with my TV book'' and we
heard them loud and clear,'' Gulla said. ``Rather than continue to
irritate the readers, we went back.''
   Distributing the survey and launching the focus groups cost the
paper ``less than $20,000,'' Gulla said. That did not include the
cost of staff time spent on the project, or those advertisers or
readers that may have left the paper over the issue, he said.

<HEAD>Animation, Surprise Endings Score Big with Ad Watchers in 1989</HEAD>

   Advertising that used animated characters
ranging from dancing raisins to a drumming rabbit scored well when
consumers were asked to pick the best commercials of 1989, a
research firm said Friday.
   Ads with surprise endings or unusual twists, such as cats that
appear to have human voices, also did well, according to the survey
by Video Storyboard Tests Inc.
   Celebrities touting products were not as popular, continuing a
slump of several years, said Video Storyboard President David
Vadehra.
   ``Some advertisers feel that is still one of the easiest ways to
get attention,'' he said.
   But he said the 1989 survey results, based on interviews with
24,000 consumers across the country, indicated TV viewers are
tuning those ads out.
   Topping the firm's 11th annual survey results were commercials
from McDonald's Corp., the nation's biggest fast-food restaurant
chain.
   The Oak Brook, Ill.-based company's advertised promotions last
year that included tie-ins with the movies ``The Little Mermaid''
and ``All Dogs Go to Heaven.''
   Vadehra said the commercials that consumers cited most often
from McDonald's were one called ``First Love'' that showed a young
boy bidding goodbye to the girl he met at McDonald's as he and his
family move to another neighborhood and another ad in which people
recited the menu in a rap song.
   Second were ads for Pepsi and Diet Pepsi, many of which
contained celebrities. But Vadehra said the Pepsi ad consumers
cited most often featured monkeys who get the right soft drink from
the vending machine for the researcher studying their behavior.
   The California Raisin ads featuring a claymation version of
entertainer Michael Jackson placed third. The campaign slipped
somewhat after ranking first in each of the past two years.
   Commercials for Energizer batteries featuring a pink toy rabbit
that played a drum and showed up without warning in ads for other
products came in fourth for the year. Vadehra said the ad was
unusual in that it not only captured attention but ``made the point
that the battery goes on and on.''
   Rounding out the top five was the campaign for Isuzu cars and
trucks that featured an Isuzu spokesman riding by a competitor's
lot and encouraging buyers to ask the dealer how his vehicles
stacked up to Isuzus.
   Ads for Bud Light beer came in sixth, followed by ads for
Coca-Cola soft drinks including appearances by entertainer George
Michael and actor Art Carney and by commercials for Miller Lite
beer.
   Commercials for Infiniti cars, which for months featured scenes
of nature, a narrator talking about values and the senses but nary
a shot of the new car, finished ninth. The ads were widely attacked
in the trade press, but Vadehra said consumers liked them because
they were so different from other car commercials.
   A woman from Florida told interviewers an Inifinit ad was ``a
heady commercial'' that made her ``do a lot of thinking and
visualizing.'' A woman from Chicago said, ``It was very subtle and
stil grabs you and makes you think about the car that is not
there.''
   Nike placed 10th with its commercials that included one
featuring baseball and football star Bo Jackson and a host of
athletes who attested that ``Bo knows'' other sports.
   Vadehra said consumers liked the ad because the athletes never
specifically pushed Nike shoes, appearing instead to be encouraging
them simply to be active.
   Among other best-liked ads from 1989 were a commercial for
Friskies pet food that showed a cat running around the house
looking for a meal as the sound of a race car engine played in the
background and an ad for Nine Lives pet food that showed kittens
who appeared to be calling for dinner with human voices.
   Vadehra said advertisers like to use animated characters because
they are safer than using celebrities, whose real-life problems can
sometimes reflect poorly on products they tout. He said the
characteristics of animated characters are sometimes better known
than those of real people, an advantage that advertisers can
exploit.

   Securities traders at the Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. division where the explosive junk-bond market
of the 1980s got its start packed their belongings Friday and rued
the loss of their jobs, their company and former leader Michael
Milken.
   Employees hurriedly entered the Wilshire Boulevard headquarters,
packed boxes, consoled colleagues and talked of other jobs.
   Drexel's parent company filed for bankruptcy protection this
week in New York after defaulting on $100 million in short-term
debt and failing to raise financing to prevent further defaults.
Drexel blamed its demise on a capital shortage created in part by a
decline in the junk-bond market. An erosion of confidence in the
firm also hurt.
   Many of the departing employees refused to talk with reporters
Friday on short, final walks to or from a parking garage dotted
with Mercedes-Benzes and Jaguars.
   One man, briefcase in hand, walked past a small group of
reporters. ``Bunch of vultures hanging over a dead body,'' he
uttered, shaking his head slightly and refusing comment.
   Others took the time to note the end of an era.
   ``There are some tears today. We all regard it as a real shame
and a tragedy,'' said John E. Oden, director of institutional
placement in Drexel's real estate division. ``I feel like it could
have been prevented.''
   Oden said many Drexel employees continued to hold Milken in high
regard and viewed his prosecution by former U.S. Attorney Rudolph
Giuliani as the beginning of the end.
   The junk-bond division was drastically altered when Milken got
into criminal trouble. He quit the firm last June, but had been
working only part-time for close to a year. He and partners still
own the headquarters building.
   ``We could have used Mike Milken,'' Oden said. ``I think he
could have had a positive impact and would have helped us get down
the road.''
   He added that Drexel's payment of fines and restitution for
securities trading violations also did the firm grave harm. A total
of $500 million of $650 million has been paid.
   Employees were on the telephones early Friday, as they usually
are. But instead of their normal duties, they were selling
positions in securities and pursuing work.
   ``I'm just going to let people know I'm available,'' Oden said.
``Life goes on. You can't get down.''
   Four men walked into the building, coffee in hand. ``You know of
any jobs?'' a couple asked.
   Oden and others said they were still reeling from the news of
Drexel's folding.
   ``It was a definite shock. People didn't see it coming,'' said
Andy Gumaer, a division vice president in the Beverly Hills office.
   ``What Michael did was a positive thing,'' Gumaer said. ``The
truth is, in hindsight, maybe the firm should have stood behind
Michael Milken. A lot of people feel that way.
   ``In hindsight, you have to wonder whether we could have called
the bluff of Giuliani, and not have pleaded guilty ....''
   Gumaer and others said employees were forming small groups to
collectively look for work and some were considering going into
business independently.
   Gumaer said he personally hoped to get back into the liquidation
firm that he helped run before he joined Drexel three years ago.
   ``I would love to get this account,'' he said, gazing at the
building that became home to Drexel's high-yield division in 1978.

<HEAD>Bank's Future in Jeopardy Despite Asset Sales</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While Bank of New England Corp. desperately tries
to improve its health by selling assets and eliminating thousands
of workers, those steps might not save the bank from the growing
ills of bad real estate loans, analysts said Friday.
   ``They are probably not far behind Drexel,'' said Virginia
Adair, a banking analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the Wall
Street investment firm that filed for bankruptcy this week over
junk bond losses.
   Since last month, when Bank of New England said its 1989 losses
should exceed $1 billion, the bank has tried to stop the
hemorrhaging. The bank is near the halfway point in a plan to sell
$6 billion in assets, and Marcia Ryan, a company spokeswoman, said
Friday the bank expects to lay off about 2,000 employees.
   The timing of the layoffs is not final, and they do not include
other payroll cuts the bank will implement through attrition and
the sale of assets, Ryan said.
   ``I think it's stable and improving,'' she said, referring to
the bank's condition.
   But analysts were more cautious. They say the sagging New
England economy, which has contributed to the bank's mounting pile
of troubled loans, could decline further and drag down the bank.
   ``They appear to be right on target with their plan, but you
wish they weren't there in the first place,'' said Gerard Cassidy,
an analyst with Tucker Anthony Inc.
   Bank of New England is expected to report its 1989 financial
results next week. At the same time, Ryan said, the bank should
disclose details of a consent order, negotiated with the federal
government, that will describe steps the bank will take to fix its
finances.
   Analysts predict Bank of New England, which employs about 17,500
people, eventually will cut its payroll to around 13,000. The
bank's assets, which totaled $31.5 billion last year, should shrink
by about one-third by the time the sales are completed.
   Before the bank took its tumble, it rose to become the
second-largest bank holding company in New England, behind Bank of
Boston Corp., and the 15th largest nationwide. Much of the growth
came through aggressive real estate lending during a construction
boom in the mid-1980s. But when the real estate market declined
during an economic downturn, the credit losses mounted.
   The bank has come under intense scrutiny by federal regulators,
and in the last several weeks, the board of directors has forced
out the bank's chairman, Walter J. Connolly, and other senior
executives.
   Analysts say the heavy presence of the federal government is
reflected in the bank's delay in releasing its financial results
and plans for the consent order.
   ``The decisions about the future are being decided on by the
management with the regulators,'' Adair said, describing the bank
as being under ``de facto'' control of the government.
   For the moment, the bank's priority is to avoid running out of
money, analysts said. Depositors have withdrawn millions of
dollars, and more money is expected to flow from the bank as
certificates of deposit, which were bought before the bad news
surfaced, reach maturity.
   Because of this cash crunch, the bank has been forced to borrow
money from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. The Federal Reserve
does not identify borrowers, but the agency's Boston bank has
loaned out more than $900 million, and analysts say Bank of New
England appears to have received most of the money.
   But even if the bank emerges from the cash crisis by completing
the sale of assets, Cassidy said the next issue will be, ``What are
they left with?''
   The bank will have a higher concentration of poor loans, since
they will be balanced against a smaller base of good assets,
analysts said.
   James Moynihan, senior vice president of Advest Inc. in Boston,
said the bank possibly could segregate the troubled loans in a
single subsidiary and bring in specialists to deal with them.
   The sound assets could be pulled together in a ``good bank,'' he
said, that can be run ``like a good bank and compete.''
   But until Bank of New England gets its house in order, Moynihan
said, ``it's clearly a day-by-day situation.''

   Bond prices finished little changed Friday after
a sluggish pre-holiday session and inconclusive evidence on the
direction of the economy.
   The closely watched 30-year Treasury issue fell 1-16 point, or
about 60 cents for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which
rises when the price declines, inched up to 8.46 percent from 8.45
percent late Thursday.
   Trading in the government bond markets ended at about 2 p.m.,
several hours earlier than normal as traders got a head start on
the three-day weekend that will mark Monday's observance of the
Presidents Day holiday.
   The government reported Friday that the U.S. trade deficit fell
to $7.17 billion in December, down from $10.29 billion in November.
The deficit narrowed to $108.58 billion last year, the smallest
yearly imbalance since 1984.
   Elliott Platt, director of economic research at Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp., said many analysts had expected
a deficit of $9 billion for December. But he said the market failed
to react to the report despite the possibility that a smaller
deficit suggests added strength in the economy, normally a negative
development for bond prices.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said industrial
production fell 1.2 percent in January following a revised 0.2
percent gain in output a month earlier.
   Analysts said the market failed to react to this report either.
William Sullivan Jr., who follows the credit markets for Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc., said the report was distorted by unusually
warm weather in January that cut the need for production of
electricity for heating and by an anticipated decline in auto
production.
   Sullivan said that by adjusting for those two special factors,
industrial production would have been up slightly.
   He said traders also are worried that interest rates are going
to rise in Japan and West Germany, luring investors to securities
in those countries rather than to dollar-denominated securities.
   In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of
short-term government issues finished unchanged, intermediate
maturities were unchanged to 1-32 point lower, and long-term issues
slipped as much as 1-16 point, according to figures provided by
Telerate Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, slipped 0.17 to 1,160.29.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds rose 1-32 point to 92 3-16. The average
yield to maturity held steady at 7.39 percent.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.92 percent as the
discount dropped 2 basis points to 7.67 percent. Yields on
six-month bills fell to 8.06 percent as the discount lost 1 basis
point to 7.65 percent. Yields on one-year bills held at 8.08
percent as the discount remained at 7.52 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each
other on overnight loans, was quoted at 8 3-16 percent, down from
8&rsqb; percent late Thursday.

   The dollar took a nosedive Friday despite an
encouraging report on the U.S. trade deficit.
   Gold prices moved higher, recouping their losses from the
previous session. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold rose
$4.70 to close at $417.10 a troy ounce. Republic National Bank of
New York later quoted a bid of $417.25 a troy ounce, up $4.25.
   The dollar opened on a strong note ahead of the government's
merchandise trade report for December, which showed an impressive
30 percent drop in the deficit, to $7.17 billion from $10.29
billion in November.
   While the figure was far better than expected, traders focused
on the fact that imports were down 5.9 percent, which they
interpreted as an indication that consumer spending is slackening.
   ``It was seen as showing underlying weakness in the economy,''
said Stephen Flanagan, a vice president at Manufacturers Hanover
Trust Co.
   The dollar's inability to extend the gains it posted in the
previous session ``brought back all the underlying bearishness in
the market,'' Flanagan said.
   A dealer with Bank of America in London said the ``fundamental
situation for the dollar is still down. ... If the dollar doesn't
rally on a $7.1 billion deficit, then it's in some trouble.''
   The currency took another hit with the release of a separate
government report that showed industrial production in January
slipped 1.2 percent. Traders said the decline was much larger than
expected.
   ``It reinforced the weakness in the economy that people picked
out of the trade report,'' Flanagan said.
   Trading slowed considerably by midday as many dealers left early
ahead of the three-day weekend. Most U.S. currency trading
operations will be closed on Monday for the Presidents Day holiday.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 144.80 yen, up 0.35 yen from
Thursday's close. Later in London, it was quoted at 144.10 yen. In
New York the dollar closed at 144.13 yen, down from 144.78 yen
Thursday.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.6953 from $1.6936 late
Thursday. In New York it cost $1.6972 to buy one pound, more
expensive than Thursday's $1.6855.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday, included: 1.6758 West German marks, down from 1.6935;
1.4910 Swiss francs, down from 1.5075; 5.6950 French francs, down
from 5.7580; 1,243.25 Italian lire, down from 1,258.50; and 1.1998
Canadian dollars, down from 1.2041.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday,
included: 1.6794 West German marks, down from 1.6805; 1.4930 Swiss
francs, down from 1.4950; 5.7045 French francs, down from 5.7130;
1.8915 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8940; 1,246.00 Italian lire,
down from 1,248.00; and 1.1997 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2060.
   Gold prices were mostly higher. In London the metal rose to a
late bid price of $416.65 a troy ounce from $415.50 bid late
Thursday. In Zurich, the metal rose to a closing bid of $416.50
from $415.75. But in Hong Kong, gold dropped $2.64 an ounce to
close at $412.69.
   Silver prices rose. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery settled at $5.328 a troy ounce, up from $5.317. In
London, the metal rose to a late bid price of $5.36 a troy ounce
from Thursday's $5.35.

<HEAD>First Boston To ``Phase Out'' Bond Futures Business</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA C. MARTINEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First Boston Corp. said Friday it was
eliminating its bond futures brokerage business for customers on
the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange and
laying off 29 employees.
   The private New York-based investment bank said it will continue
trading listed futures for its own account on the two exchanges.
   ``We will be phasing out in an orderly fashion so customers can
unwind their futures positions and-or transfer accounts to other
brokers,'' said First Boston spokesman Fred Garcia.
   First Boston said the decision was made after a six-month
``strategic review'' of all its businesses. The company would not
disclose the number of customers or futures contracts involved.
Both exchanges declined comment.
   The move will affect 29 employees in New York, Chicago, Los
Angeles and Tokyo, who were notified on Friday, Garcia said.
   First Boston will retain two of nine current seats on the Board
of Trade and at least one of seven on the Merc.
   In a prepared statement, futures Managing Director Robert S.
Cohen said changes in the futures market in the last 12 years
prompted the decision which ``was unrelated to events in any other
financial markets.''
   ``First Boston's ability to provide value-added service for our
customers has diminished given the breadth of readily-accessible
information and analytics and the overcapacity in the brokerage
community,'' Cohen said.
   The securities brokerage industry has slumped since the 1987
stock market crash. Several brokerages have pared down their
businesses and laid off hundreds of workers. This week, the parent
of one of the nation's largest brokerages, Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc., announced it had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
   First Boston announced 200 layoffs last spring in what Garcia
called part of the overcapacity after the stock market crash of
1987.
   In January 1989, First Boston merged with its London-based
sister company Financiere Credit Suisse-First Boston in a $1.1
billion deal. The combined entity, which is privately held, is
called CS First Boston Inc. The merger capped a difficult two-year
period during which First Boston lost about $100 million in trading
risky options on Treasury bonds and another $50 million in trading
mortgage-backed securities.

<TEXT>
   Industrial production took its biggest plunge
in nearly four years last month, the government said Friday, but
analysts cited temporary factors for the 1.2 percent drop and said
output should resume its sluggish growth.
   The Federal Reserve said the production slump was the steepest
since output plummeted 1.3 percent in March 1986. But it attributed
the decrease to a drop in energy use due to abnormally warm weather
and to temporary layoffs in the automobile industry to correct
bloated inventories.
   ``If you take energy and autos out, the index was up 0.2
percent,'' said Michael K. Evans, head of a Washington economic
forecasting firm bearing his name.
   ``The figures are more commensurate with the `soft-landing'
scenario for the economy _ that is, slow growth _ than with the
possibility that we're actually heading into a recession,'' said
Gordon Richards, economic policy director for the National
Association of Manufacturers.
   Priscilla Trumbull, an economist with the WEFA Group in Bala
Cynwyd, Pa., agreed, saying, ``Outside of those areas, production
basically was moving very slowly upward and that's what we've been
seeing for the last three to four months.''
   The Fed said utility output, which rose 6.3 percent during
December's bitter cold, reversed itself in January and fell 10.7
percent.
   According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, January temperatures were the warmest for that
month since the government began keeping records 96 years ago.
December was the fourth coldest on record.
   ``The output of motor vehicles was curtailed drastically,'' the
department said, as ``automobile assemblies plunged to a 4.1
million unit annual rate from a 6.2 million unit rate in December.''
   As a result, manufacturing production, which represents 84
percent of industrial output, was off 0.9 percent last month.
   But, Ms. Trumbull said, many of the laid-off workers have
returned to production lines ``and we'll probably see an uptick''
in February's report.
   Durable goods manufacturing, which includes autos and other
big-ticket items expected to last more than three years, was down
1.7 percent. Non-durable goods manufacturing, on the other hand,
rose 0.2 percent.
   Mining production was up 2.1 percent after falling 2 percent in
December because of the cold weather.
   The changes meant the industrial production index in January
stood at 140.9 percent of its 1977 base, down from 142.5 percent a
month earlier.
   Reflecting the decline in output, the Fed's report Friday on the
operating rate of the nation's factories, mines and utilities also
dipped 1.2 percentage point to 81.9 percent last month. It was the
lowest since a similar 81.9 percent rate in October 1987 that
followed an 81.1 percent rate a month earlier. The rate had
remained steady at 83.1 percent during the last three months of
1989.
   Analysts generally consider an operating rate of 85 percent or
above as an indication of inflationary pressures so, while
indicating a weak economy, it could be interpreted as good news for
consumers.
   The manufacturing-plant operating rate in January also slipped
to 81.9 percent, from 82.9 percent in December. The rate had peaked
at 84.7 percent in January 1989. The rate at factories producing
durable goods fell from 80.9 percent to 79.4 percent.
   ``Operating rates for auto and truck assembly facilities dropped
to levels near their 1982 recession lows,'' the department said.
   The utility operating rate fell from 86.4 percent to 77.1
percent in part because utilization at power plants dropped about
10 percentage points because of the weather, the department said.
   The rate at factories producing non-durable goods fell 0.1
percentage point to 85.6 percent. The operating rate at mines was
down 0.8 percentage point to 84.7 percent.

   The stock market was mixed at the close of a
drifting session Friday, getting little benefit from
better-than-expected news on international trade.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 13.96 to
2,635.59, finishing the week with a net loss of 12.61 points.
   Advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 760 up, 737
down and 440 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 166.84 million
shares, down from 174.63 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 193.95 million shares.
   The Commerce Department reported that the nation's trade deficit
shrank to $7.17 billion in December from $10.29 billion the month
before.
   That came as a pleasant surprise to forecasters, who had
generally been expecting the gap between imports and exports to be
about $9 billion.
   But analysts said traders remained leery of chasing after the
recent upswing in stock prices.
   Fears persist that a rise in worldwide interest rates so far in
1990 might have increased the chances of a recession and a
continuing slump in corporate profits.
   Indeed, several individual issues sold off in Friday's trading
on word of earnings problems of one kind or another.
   The most prominent was Hewlett-Packard, down 3&rsqb; at 43~ in active
trading. The company reported earnings for its fiscal quarter ended
Jan. 31 of 72 cents a share, down from 83 cents in the comparable
period a year earlier.
   Other losers among the blue chips included Philip Morris, down 1
at 38\; Exxon, down { at 48; General Motors, down 1 at 43; General
Electric, down | at 62, and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down {
at 39}.
   Waban Inc. dropped 1| to 8. The company projected a significant
decline in profits for the fiscal year that began a few weeks ago.
   Hunt Manufacturing, which projected ``virtually flat'' earnings
for the quarter that ends March 4, lost 1&lsqb; to 18}.
   Windmere Corp., which posted a 1989 loss, tumbled 1{ to 4}.
   By contrast, Castle &amp; Cooke jumped 3\ to 35. Late Thursday the
company reported plans to spin off its Dole food business to
shareholders as a separate entity.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $14.68 billion, or 0.45
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .64 to 183.75.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 2.70 to 383.81, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 2.17 at 332.72.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
slipped .60 to 429.01. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 358.77, down .83.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Surge on Supply Drop, Stronger Economy Signs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices soared Friday on New York's Commodity
Exchange amid positive economic signals and signs of dwindling
copper supplies.
   On other commodity markets, precious metal futures advanced;
petroleum futures slipped; livestock and meat futures were mixed;
and grains and soybeans retreated.
   Copper futures settled unchanged to 4.35 cents higher with the
contract for spot delivery up 4.35 cents at $1.1285 a pound and the
more actively traded March contract up 4.3 cents at $1.1135 a pound.
   Traders bid up prices going into the close despite the fact that
the market will be closed Monday for Presidents Day. Traders
usually are cautious heading into a three-day weekend.
   Signs of shrinking copper stocks provided the strongest upward
pressure. After two days of unchanged levels, the Commodity
Exchange reported a 90-ton drawdown in registered warehouse stocks
Thursday to a 16-month-low of 3,629 tons.
   After the close of trading Friday, the Comex reported a much
sharper daily drop in warehouse stocks, down 609 tons to 3,020 tons.
   Analysts said much of the copper withdrawn from warehouses
Friday appeared to be headed for the Far East.
   Thursday's stocks report came on the heels of a government
report that January housing starts were running at a record-high
annual pace. That news was bullish for copper since copper wire and
tubing are used heavily in home construction.
   The housing-starts surprise was followed Friday by the
government's report that the nation closed out 1989 with a $108.6
billion trade deficit, the smallest in five years.
   The good economic news contrasted sharply with recent
perceptions of a recession in the making. And as the economy
strengthens, so does demand for copper by the manufacturing and
construction industries.
   ``I think some of the recent economic data has suggested that we
could run into problems with copper supplies,'' said Randolph
Donney, a research analyst with the commodities brokerage Elders
Futures Inc.
   Precious metal futures strengthened as the dollar weakened
against other major currencies.
   Gold futures rose $4.60 to $5.50 on the Comex with February
settling at $417.10 a troy ounce; silver futures were 0.9 cent to
1.1 cents higher with March at $5.34 a troy ounce.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures settled 10
cents lower to $2.50 higher with April at $525.40 a troy ounce.
   Petroleum futures weakened on the New York Merc amid
profit-taking after five straight days of gains in the crude oil
and heating oil markets.
   West Texas Intermediate crude settled 20 cents to 42 cents lower
with March at $22.42 a barrel; heating oil was .95 cent to 1.17
cents lower with March at 57.48 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline
was .40 cent to .75 cent lower with March at 59.99 cents a gallon.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, cattle futures ended mixed
and pork futures finished lower ahead of the Agriculture
Department's monthly cattle-on-feed report for the seven largest
cattle-producing states.
   The report showed a 7 percent increase from a year ago in the
number of cattle being fed for slaughter as of Feb. 1, compared
with traders' expectations for about a 4 percent increase.
   Some analysts predicted cattle futures prices would drop sharply
Tuesday in reaction to the report.
   Live cattle settled .10 cent lower to .28 cent higher with
February at 79.77 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .23
cent higher with March at 82.17 cents a pound; live hogs were .10
cent to .40 cent lower with February at 49.52 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .70 cent to 1.58 cents lower with February at
49.85 cents a pound.
   On the Chicago Board of Trade, wheat futures settled } cent to
2\ cents lower with March at $3.84 a bushel; corn futures were }
cent to 1{ cents lower with March at $2.41\ a bushel; oats were 2
cents to 2\ cents lower with March at $1.38\ a bushel; soybeans
were 1\ cents to 2{ cents lower with March at $5.69} a bushel.

   Energy futures prices slumped in subdued trading
Friday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, pressured by
profit-taking and warm weather in the Northeast.
   The March contract for West Texas Intermediate, the main grade
of U.S. crude oil, fell 42 cents to $22.42 a 42-gallon barrel.
April crude ended at $22.25 a barrel, down 18 cents, and May crude
fell 20 cents to $22.04 a barrel.
   Among refined products, wholesale unleaded gasoline for March
delivery fell 0.65 cent to 59.99 cents a gallon. April declined
0.71 cent to 60.93 cents a gallon and May dropped 0.75 cent to
64.90 cents.
   No. 2 heating oil for delivery in March ended at 57.48 cents a
gallon, down 1.17 cents. April finished down 1.15 cents at 56.81
cents and May heating oil lost 0.97 cent to 55.87 cents.
   Energy analysts said trading was light ahead of Monday's
Presidents Day holiday as warm weather in the Northeastern states
and profit-taking helped dampen prices.
   ``Warm weather hit the heating oil market and that led the
market lower,'' said Peter Beutel, an analyst for Elders Futures
Inc.
   Profit-taking followed Thursday's price rise after news that a
volcano eruption in Alaska might disrupt oil shipments. Although a
34,000-barrel terminal was temporarily evacuated after the eruption
of Mount Redoubt, no major interference was reported.

<TEXT>
   The Coca-Cola Co. said it was boosting its
quarterly dividend by 18 percent _ its largest increase in 30 years
_ and recommending a a 2-for-1 stock split.
   The dividend increase _ from 34 cents to 40 cents _ marks the
28th consecutive year the Atlanta-based company has raised its
dividend. It is payable April 1 to stockholders of record March 15.
   Stockholders are to vote on the stock split at their April 18
annual meeting. Additional shares would be distributed May 11 to
stockholders of record May 1.
   Roberto Goizueta, chairman and chief executive, said the twin
announcement ``reflects the fundamental strength of our global soft
drink business and our optimism for its future growth.''
   Analyst Lee Wilder of Robinson-Humphrey Co. in Atlanta said he
expects Coca-Cola dividends to increase at least 15 percent
annually over the next several years, in line with expected
earnings increases.
   Meanwhile, analysts said the stock split will make the company's
stock more affordable for individual investors. Coke's shares rose
$2.37{ on the New York Stock Exchange Thursday to $69.50.
   Coca-Cola's last previous stock split was a 3-for-1 deal in
1986. It has 336 million shares outstanding among 100,000
shareholders worldwide.

   After leaving Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. on
Friday for the last time, Christine Karpeles put her arms around
several co-workers and announced loudly to camera crews, ``We're
going to Disneyland.''
   But her misty eyes betrayed the smile on her face as she
mimicked the sports heroes who are paid to shout the same
promotional phrase after winning a championship.
   For most of the 5,300 employees of the collapsed securities
giant, this was their worst day.
   In letters to thousands of workers let go Friday, the company
said it had failed despite ``Herculean efforts to obtain additional
capital.''
   Drexel's parent company filed for bankruptcy court protection
Tuesday and is liquidating its operations.
   By the dozens, employees who hours earlier were told they were
fired were emerging from its doors in the heart of the financial
district with pained expressions.
   ``I was crying because it's sad,'' Karpeles, 21, of New York
said after waving goodbye to the building.
   ``This is just the beginning. The industry is falling apart.
Everybody is going to be hurt by this,'' said the secretary in
corporate finance.
   ``It felt like a wake,'' said Judy Finn, who pushed a shopping
cart full of $350 worth of computer equipment for her daughter,
Debbie, who was fired as a supervisory analyst in the research
department. The company offered employees computer equipment and
other odds and ends at bargain prices on the last day.
   ``My daughter's unemployed. I'm very sad,'' she said.
   The younger Finn said she saw no irony in a button _ ``Junk
Bonds Keep America Fit'' _ which she wore on her blouse.
   ``It had a great spirit,'' she said of Drexel.
   It was pride for the company that kept most of the executives
and analysts from talking to about a dozen reporters, who drew
angry glances from some workers outside Drexel's doors, said
analyst Ken Haim, 26, the only one who would talk among about 60
men in suits and ties who left Drexel over a two-hour period.
   ``People seemed to feel more sadness that the company was gone
than for their own plights,'' Haim said.
   He said many workers blame the press for fanning the flames of
distrust for the company after its leader, Michael Milken, was
indicted on fraud and racketeering charges last year.
   Milken was widely credited with raising the company to fame and
billion-dollar profits through his role in the corporate takeover
craze financed by risky high-yield bonds.
   One man walked out of the building loudly cursing Rudolph
Giuliani, the former federal prosecutor who led the investigation
that resulted in criminal charges against Milken and Drexel.
   But another analyst who asked that his name not be used blamed
the downfall on ``some management mistakes made in the last year or
so.''
   ``It's a terrible thing. It didn't have to happen,'' he said.

   Employees of the nation's Big Three automakers
will feel the financial pinch that's squeezing their companies as
they watch their profit-sharing checks shrivel or, in Chrysler
Corp.'s case, disappear.
   The automakers reported 1989 earnings this week, including the
base for profit-sharing calculations _ earnings on their U.S.
operations. After all the arithmetic is done, the Big Three will
spend 93.7 percent less on profit-sharing this year than they did
last year.
   ``They'd rather make the money, I'm sure, and pay it out,'' said
auto analyst Joseph Phillippi if Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New
York.
   Chrysler said Tuesday it made $359 million during 1989, but that
included a $309 million one-time gain from the sale of stock in
Mitsubishi Motors Corp. and a one-time, $557 million charge for
closing two plants and other matters.
   In sum, the nation's No. 3 automaker didn't make enough money to
trigger profit-sharing formulas for hourly and some salaried
employees or bonus provisions for upper-level white-collar workers.
   About 443,000 of GM's hourly and salaried workers will get $50
each in profit-sharing, the company said Thursday. The world's
largest automaker declined to say specifically how much it made in
the United States, other than to say only that GM was profitable in
the market.
   Friday, Ford Motor Co. announced that about 150,000 of its
hourly and salaried workers would receive profit-sharing checks of
about $1,025 each next month. Ford said it earned $1.1 billion in
the United States last year.
   Last year, GM workers received $265 each in profit-sharing,
Chrysler employees got $720 apiece and eligible Ford workers
received $2,800 each.
   While Ford's payments this year are the largest among the Big
Three, they don't match what Honda's employees received in
November. Each of the 8,800 employees at the four Ohio plants
operated by Honda of America Manufacturing Inc. received an average
$1,600 in ``bonus-sharing'' payments, said spokeswoman Sharon Van
Winkle. The payments are based on worldwide profits from all
operations of the Japanese automaker.
   There are no profit-sharing provisions for manufacturing
employees at the U.S. factories of Toyota Motor Corp., Mazda Motor
Corp. and Nissan Motor Co. Ltd., all of Japan.
   Nor are there profit-sharing programs at the GM-Toyota venture
in Fremont, Calif., called New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., or
the Chrysler-Mitsubishi Diamond-Star Motors Corp. plant in Normal,
Ill.
   In all, the Big Three will spend about $40 million in
profit-sharing payments this year, compared with the $604.1 million
they laid out last year.
   The decrease could affect contract talks between the United Auto
Workers union and the Big Three automakers. Negotiations are
expected to begin in July. The contracts expire at midnight Sept.
14.
   ``Ford obviously is in a decidedly advantageous position on a
labor relations standpoint as a result of this,'' Phillippi said.
   UAW President Owen Bieber said Tuesday that although there would
be no profit-sharing for Chrysler hourly employees, ``at least
there will be some equality of sacrifice and Chrysler executives
will have to go without bonuses as well.''
   There may be a problem at GM, Phillippi said.
   ``The problem GM is going to have is the hourly guys get $50 and
the executive bonus pool group is probably going to get a pretty
sizeable check,'' he said. ``It's only going to make sitting down
at the bargaining table rather sticky.''

<HEAD>Nielsen Picked to Measure Cable TV Viewership in Europe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp.'s A.C. Nielsen subsidiary
said Friday it has been selected to measure the cable television
audience across 11 European countries.
   Nielsen, which is based in Northbrook, Ill., said it was
selected over two other audience-measurement companies, Audits of
Great Britain and Britain's RSL, for the contract awarded by
Pan-European Television Audience Research.
   Terms were not disclosed.
   Nielsen said its operations in Great Britain will direct the
project, which will collect viewing information from 3,500
households representing the European cable TV audience of 15-20
million households. It said it plans to publish the first results
in August.
   Nielsen said the industry group making the award was composed of
the British Broadcasting Corp., Turner Broadcasting System's Cable
News Network, the Italian state television service RAI, News Corp.
Ltd.'s Sky Television and two German-language satellite channels,
among others.
   The services are delivered via satellite to cable households
throughout Europe.
   Krus Benson of Sky Television, the chairman of the industry
group, was quoted as saying the group was ``looking to achieve a
consistently high standard of information throughout 11 countries.''
   The countries involved in the measurement system are West
Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, Norway,
Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Great Britain and Ireland.
   Nielsen said the contract fits with its plans to deliver
comprehensive integrated information on both a country-by-country
basis and across national borders within Europe.
   Nielsen has been measuring U.S. television audiences for 40
years. It also measures TV audiences in nine other countries.

<HEAD>SEC Accuses Bolar Pharmaceutical of Fraud</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission filed
fraud charges Friday against Bolar Pharmaceutical Co., accusing the
beleaguered generic drug manufacturer of making false and
misleading disclosure statements.
   The SEC, in a complaint filed at U.S. District Court in
Washington, accused Bolar of making misleading and inadequate
disclosure to the investing public about an agreement with the Food
and Drug Administration to suspend shipment of some of its drugs.
   The SEC action, the second against Bolar in as many months, also
named former Bolar President Robert Shulman. Last month, the SEC
suspended trading in Bolar's securities for 10 days.
   The SEC accused Bolar and Shulman of violating the anti-fraud
provisions of federal securities law, which requires prompt and
truthful disclosure of significant events regarding a company.
   The civil complaint sought a court order barring Bolar and
Shulman from further alleged violations.
   The complaint alleged that Bolar failed to disclose that it
reached an agreement with the Food and Drug Administration earlier
this month to suspend shipment temporarily of all of its products
until at least Feb. 6.
   Bolar agreed to the temporary shipment suspension ``pending an
agreement with the FDA to indefinitely withdraw its narrow-range
therapeutic drugs with the potential for serious physical harm,''
the SEC alleged, adding ``These facts were not disclosed to
investors until Feb. 8, after trading in the securities of Bolar
was halted on the American Stock Exchange.''
   Between the time the 10-day trading suspension ended Feb. 5 _
when Bolar stock was trading a $10.75 a share _ until trading on
the AMEX was halted Feb. 7, 2.27 million shares of Bolar stock were
traded and the price rose to $13.12 per share, according to the SEC.
   The Copaigue, N.Y.-based generic drug maker said Friday it had
no comment on the SEC suit.
   On Jan. 23, the SEC suspended trading of Bolar securities for 10
days after allegations that the company falsified safety claims
about a high blood pressure drug.
   That suspension came after a House subcommittee disclosed a
letter from Bolar's attorneys that indicated Bolar apparently
falsified documents about safety tests for its generic version of a
popular anti-hypertension drug, Dyazide.
   Dyazide is a widely prescribed high blood pressure medication
made by SmithKline Beecham. There is no FDA allegation against that
drug.
   In August, the FDA said it would seek to remove Bolar's version
of Dyazide, claiming the drug maker may have misrepresented
documentation and safety data. Bolar disputed the allegations.
   However, the House Energy and Commerce Committee's subcommittee
on oversight and investigation disclosed a letter from attorneys
for Bolar that said the company appeared to have used false
documents to fight government action against its generic form of
Dyazide.

   A surprisingly large 30 percent trade-balance
improvement in December allowed the nation to close out 1989 with a
$108.6 billion deficit, the smallest in five years, the government
said.
   Private economists noted, however, that while U.S. exports hit
an all-time high last year, so did imports, driven upward by
America's growing dependence on foreign oil.
   Some economists forecast Friday that the deficit this year will
worsen as consumers continue to buy imported products and the
foreign oil bill rises.

   Industrial production took its biggest plunge
in nearly four years last month, the government said, but analysts
cited temporary factors for the 1.2 percent drop.
   The Federal Reserve said Friday the production slump was the
steepest since output plummeted 1.3 percent in March 1986. But it
attributed the decrease to a drop in energy use due to abnormally
warm weather and to temporary layoffs in the automobile industry to
correct bloated inventories.

   Regulators said Friday they filed suit seeking
more than $500 million from Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the parent
of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and others over an alleged fraud
scheme that led to the failure of a Texas savings institution.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. alleges that five former
salesmen at Drexel, whose parent filed for bankruptcy this week,
and the now-defunct E.F. Hutton &amp; Co., which was absorbed by
Shearson, helped put together a scheme to defraud Guaranty Federal
Savings and Loan Association of Dallas.
   The agency, which provides deposit insurance for banks and S&amp;Ls,
seeks $129.2 million in actual damages and $387.6 million in
punitive damages. The suit was filed Wednesday in U.S. District
Court in Dallas.
   A Shearson spokesman disputed the allegations and said the
company would seek to have the suit dismissed. A Drexel spokesman
did not immediately return a call seeking comment.
   The suit alleges that the sales representatives helped two
former chairmen of Guaranty Federal, Paul Sau-Ki Cheng and Simon
Edward Heath, divert profits from government securities trading
into trusts and corporations controlled by the two.
   ``The central purpose of the fraud scheme was to divert
federally-insured deposits to shore up a takeover attempt by Cheng
and Heath of U.S. Home Corp., a large publicly traded home building
company,'' the FDIC said.
   At the time, Drexel was U.S. Home's investment banker. The suit
says personnel from Drexel's Beverly Hills, Calif., office
``advised and encouraged'' Heath and Cheng to attempt the takeover.
   The acquisition failed, resulting in a loss of $68.5 million to
Guaranty Federal but profits of $49.6 million to brokers and $11.1
million to trusts controlled by Heath and Cheng, the FDIC said.
   Guaranty Federal, with $2 billion in assets, failed in September
1988. Heath and Cheng are charged in an unrelated criminal
indictment with defrauding the S&amp;L.
   The defendants in the FDIC suit are Drexel, Shearson Lehman
Hutton Holdings Inc. as successor to E.F. Hutton, Heath, Cheng, the
five former salesmen, and two trusts and three corporations
controlled by Heath and Cheng.
   Shearson spokesman Steve Faigen said there is ``absolutely no
evidence of wrongdoing or merit to the allegations. The claim for
damages is preposterous and we will seek to have the suit dismissed
promptly.''
   Phone numbers for the other defendants could not be found
immediately.

   Air Wisconsin has signed a letter of

feeder routes for United Airlines as United Express, officials
announced Friday.
   William Geenen, Air Wisconsin's vice president for finance, said
the acquisition would be operated as a separate business and not be

airline was purchased in 1985.
   The move will represent Air Wisconsin's first venture into

   Aspen is a 35-year-old, family-controlled airline operating
primarily between Aspen and Denver. It also connects a number of
smaller communities with Denver and seasonally flies ski charter
trips from Chicago, Dallas and Los Angeles to Aspen.
   Aspen operates a fleet of four BAe-146 jets and 10 48-passenger
Convair 580 turboprops.
   Air Wisconsin officials say that company will only receive the
four BAe-146 jets and will operate the Aspen-Denver routes and
seasonal Aspen service from Chicago, Los Angeles and Dallas.
   A majority of the stock in Aspen Airways is owned by the Donald
Ringsby family.
   Mesa Airlines of Farmington, N.M., purchased the Convairs and
other routes and will operate them under the Mesa corporate name,
but also fly as United Express.

<HEAD>Did Threat of Racketeering Indictment Cinch Drexel Demise?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Late in 1988, former U.S. Attorney Rudolph
Giuliani gave Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. a choice: Plead guilty to
securities crimes or face indictment on racketeering charges.
   ``It was like he put a gun in the middle of the table and said,
`I can shoot you, or you can shoot yourself,''' said a Drexel
junk-bond executive who quit last year after 20 years at the firm.
   Many on Wall Street _ not only defenders of the investment
Goliath _ believe Drexel's fate was determined not last week when
it defaulted on $100 million in debt but in December 1988 when it
agreed to admit criminal behavior in six transactions and pay $650
million in penalties.
   Prosecution under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations act threatened Drexel with pretrial asset seizures
that likely would have put the firm out of business on the spot.
   By pleading guilty in the government's insider trading sweep,
Drexel gained the right to keep peddling junk bonds, underwriting
stock and arranging mergers. It avoided the lengthy public ordeal
of a trial and further erosion of investor confidence.
   But it was forced to sever ties with junk bond dynamo Michael
Milken, who led the firm's rapid rise in the 1980s to the pinnacle
of Wall Street. It agreed to disembowel some profitable operations
and permit microscope scrutiny by federal regulators that shackled
some businesses.
   If Giuliani's threat was no more than a bluff by a
publicity-friendly prosecutor (who went on to run unsuccessfully
for mayor), then Drexel is no more and 5,000 people are losing
their jobs without proof that crimes were committed.
   ``Without a judge and a jury, as soon as they brought RICO
charges they killed Drexel,'' a top executive at a rival Wall
Street firm said last week. ``They just chose a slow death instead
of a fast one.''
   Off Wall Street, former prosecutors, regulators and legal
experts said the theory of government culpability in Drexel's
demise is an attempt to turn the perpetrator into a victim. The
pursuit of Drexel may have been aggressive but the firm admitted to
the crimes alleged and the government's case was strong, they said.
   ``Do the best-paid and most articulate defense attorneys advise
clients to plead guilty and pay $650 million in fines in response
to an empty threat?'' said Michael Goldsmith, a RICO expert and law
professor at Brigham Young University.
   ``When you're indicted for fraud that's going to affect your
business,'' he said. ``Surely these companies aren't suggesting
they shouldn't be indicted for fraud?''
   After settling last year, Drexel halved its work force, dumped
businesses and restructured top management in an effort to compete
as a medium-sized firm. But without Milken leading the firm's
Beverly Hills, Calif., junk bond division, Drexel's pre-eminence in
the lucrative field began to falter, and some clients steered clear
because of its tarnished reputation.
   ``The assessment at the commission was that if it could not
operate in an honest fashion it should not operate,'' said David
Ruder, the Securities and Exchange Commssion chairman during the
Drexel case.
   ``The (SEC) complaint is a very strong indictment of the way
they did business there,'' he said. ``Our effort was to reform that
operation. There was always some doubt about whether once reformed
it would work.''
   In filing for bankruptcy protection last week, Drexel's parent
said it was hurt by a capital shortage partly created by a decline
in the high-yield bond market Milken helped create. Analysts said
that pointed out problems in relying on one product to sustain a
financial services business.
   As Drexel's problems came to a head, government regulators
refused to step in and ask banks to provide Drexel with enough
money to keep it alive. Officials in Washington said they
determined that Drexel's elimination would not have a serious
impact on the nation's financial markets.
   ``I think it was clear from the outset of the investigation that
(Drexel) might not survive because the investigation went to the
heart of their business,'' said former SEC enforcement director
Gary Lynch, who spearheaded the Drexel probe.
   ``The settlement ... gave them every chance at survivial,'' he
said. ``Unfortunately for the firm there was a general
deterioration in the junk market that obviously hurt them.''
   In addition, Drexel insiders say that the firm embarked on
several shaky deals in the post-Milken era that bore the sign of
``quantity not quality'' and further eroded its reputation. A
general slump in the securities industry didn't help either.
   Milken has been charged in a 98-count racketeering and fraud
indictment in connection with Drexel's underlying crimes _ as well
as others _ but has yet to go on trial. His friends claim that if
he is acquitted, then Drexel's passing was for naught since he was
the supposed architect of Drexel's crimes.
   The theory of government blame holds sway with many Drexel
employees, who remained loyal to the firm and defensive to the
outside world in the face of the scandals. ``We were really screwed
by the government,'' Ken Haim, a 26-year-old Drexel debt analyst,
said after he was fired on Friday.
   Detractors claim the government was on a witch hunt in its
ballyhooed crackdown on white-collar crime. The Wall Street
Journal, a forceful critic of the RICO law, said in an editorial
last week that ``it's now clear that the collapse of Drexel was
decided in the prosecutorial hothouse of the late 1980s.''
   ``Most notable was Mr. Giuliani's decision to not merely bring
traditional charges against Mr. Milken and Drexel, but to use
RICO,'' the Journal said. ``It didn't matter that the RICO law was
designed by Congress explicitly for the Mafia or that this would
somehow morally equate investment banking with loan sharking and
murder.''
   But Goldmsith said: ``To a degree it relects Wall Street's bias
against RICO. I suppose the fear that they have is, `There but for
the grace of God go I.'''

   A Hong Kong investment concern battling to win
a seat on the board of Cummins Engine Co. has countersued the
Indiana diesel engine maker, documents disclosed Friday.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in
Washington, Industrial Equity (Pacific) Ltd., said it sued Cummins
Thursday at federal court in Indianapolis.
   The lawsuit named Cummins and six of its directors, including
chairman and chief executive officer Henry B. Schacht. It claimed
that the six ``manage Cummins not for the benefit of its
shareholders and its other corporate constituencies, but to enhance
their own personal power and prestige.''
   Cummins sued IEP, which holds a 14.9 percent stake in the
Columbus, Ind.-based manufacturer, seeking to force IEP to sell its
1.9 million shares of Cummins stock.
   Cummins launched its lawsuit after IEP sought representation on
the Cummins board.
   In its countersuit, which sought to overturn Cummins'
poison-pill, antitake over defense, IEP, the Hong Kong arm of New
Zealand's Brierley Investments Ltd., charged that inside directors
``have gone to extraordinary lengths to deter investment by any
large shareholder who might exercise independent judgment or ask
questions.''
   There was no answer at Cummins headquarters when called for
comment late Friday.

Association of Ottawa, Kan., the state's largest thrift and one of
the few S&amp;Ls to participate heavily in the futures markets.
   To protect depositors, the Office of Thrift Supervision said it
was turning the institution over to the Resolution Trust Corp.
   ``Franklin was operating in an unsafe and unsound condition
likely to cause insolvency or a substantial dissipation of
assets,'' the thrift office said.
   With $11.4 billion in assets at the end of December, it was the
largest thrift in Kansas. It was the 21st biggest S&amp;L in the
nation, according to Sheshunoff Information Services Inc. of
Austin, Texas.
   Franklin has $4.7 billion in 154,423 deposit accounts.
Regulators said its nine branches would remain open and all
deposits would be protected up to the $100,000 insurance limit.
   The institution specialized in a complex financial strategy in
which it accepted high-rate deposits from Wall Street brokers and
invested them in mortgage-backed securities, using futures
contracts to protect itself from swings in interest rates.
   However, the thrift office said the strategy didn't work and the
S&amp;L was hit hard by a change in interest rates.
   ``Frankly I'm very suprised. Their entire strategy was based on
protecting Franklin from interest rate risk and they had a very
sophisticated system for doing that,'' said Henry Peltz, an analyst
with Keefe, Bruyette and Woods in New York.
   The announcement came one day after the publicly traded S&amp;L
disclosed that regulators were conducting what it called a routine
examination of its operations. Franklin Vice Chairman John
Scowcroft had assured reporters that the thrift was not in danger
of becoming insolvent.
   Franklin was seized under a provision of the S&amp;L law enacted
last August that permits regulators to step in to prevent an
institution from dissipating its assets or engaging in unsafe and
unsound practices, thrift office spokesman William Fulwider said.
   Although Franklin met its net worth requirement as of Dec. 31,
regulators ordered it to book further losses that would deplete all
of its tangible capital and saw no reasonable prospect that it
could raise the capital, Fulwider said.
   Franklin and regulators were involved in an accounting dispute
centering on the treatment of $119 million in deferred losses from
the futures market, which the institution planned to take over five
years.
   If a heavy loss depressed Franklin's net worth below regulatory
requirements, the thrift had an agreement with zero-coupon bond
holders that would trigger an even larger reduction in net worth.
   On Thursday, Franklin reported a net profit of $3 million, or 8
cents a share, in its second quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a
loss of $21.5 million in the same quarter of 1988.
   It also announced a management shakeup in which William J.
Marshall was named president and chief executive officer, replacing
Duane H. Hall.
   The RTC said it appointed John Carr as Franklin's managing
agent. He is the former chief executive officer of Gibraltar
Savings of Beverly Hills, Calif. The agency also is hiring two
firms, Hyperion Capital Management Inc. and Ranieri Wilson &amp; Co.
Inc., to advise it on how to handle Franklin's securities and
futures portfolio.
   Founded in 1889 as the Ottawa Mutual Loan and Savings
Association, Franklin mounted a rapid-growth strategy that relied
excessively on high-cost deposits from money brokers, the thrift
office said. As of Dec. 31, 70 percent of its deposits came from
brokers.
   ``Their problem was they had a very high interest expense, one
of the highest in the business,'' said Kenneth H. Thomas, a
financial institutions analyst in Miami. He noted that the S&amp;L also
had a big junk bond portfolio _ $247 million at the end of
September, the 11th largest in the country.
   Franklin's parent firm, Franklin Savings Corp., owns 92 percent
of thrift's stock, while 5.5 percent of the stock is traded
publicly in the over-the-counter market.
   Franklin officials declined to comment on the seizure, directing
questions to the institution's government managers.

<HEAD>Vestron Names Potential Candidate for Merger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Vestron Inc., a film and video company
whose credits include ``Dirty Dancing'' and ``Hamburger Hill,''
said Friday it was discussing a possible merger with LIVE
Entertainment Inc., a Los Angeles-based video and music
entertainment company.
   Vestron confirmed discussions over a non-cash merger in which
LIVE would buy all of Vestron's assets or securities in exchange
for a package of LIVE equity securities. It said Tuesday it was
considering a proposal from an unidentified party.
   LIVE is an entertainment software distributor with anticipated
1989 revenue of $450 million, up from $352 million in 1988, said
company spokeswoman Vicki Greenleaf.
   It owns International Video Entertainment, a home video
distributor in Los Angeles; Strawberries record stores of Milford,
Mass.; and Lieberman Enterprises, a Minneapolis-based services firm
for the retail industry.
   Vestron, which had $335 million in sales in 1988, reported a
nine-month net loss of $87.8 million last year, compared to net
income of $18.9 million in the same 1988 period.
   The company owns Vestron Video, a domestic videocassette
distributor; Video Store, a retail video outlet; and Vestron
International Group, which distributes videocassettes abroad, said
John McInerney of Abernathy-MacGregor Group, Vestron's investor
relations consultant.
   Another division, Vestron Pictures, began in January 1986 as an
offshoot of Vestron Video, which at the time was the country's
largest independent videocassette distributor.
   Its completed or near-finished films include ``Little
Monsters,'' starring Fred Savage, ``Fear'' with Ally Sheedy, and
``Blue Steel'' with Jamie Lee Curtis.
   The division shut down in August because of a cash-flow strain
caused when Security Pacific National Bank decided to end an
agreement to provide a six-year, $100 million line of credit,
McInerney said. He said Security Pacific agreed to provide the
credit line Aug. 10, 1988, and withdrew from the deal on Oct. 21,
1988.
   Vestron officials have filed suit alleging breach of contract.

   Five of AT&amp;T's 12 national data
processing offices will be phased out over the next 18 months as
part of a cost-cutting plan, resulting in the loss of 1,000 jobs,
the company said Friday.
   The move continues a cutback in the information management
services division of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. begun three
years ago. That division has shrunk from 7,700 workers to 7,400
since 1987, not including the latest cuts, the company said.
   AT&amp;T said it would try to offer transfers or early retirement to
the workers affected.
   AT&amp;T said it expects to save about $70 million a year when the
division has been fully consolidated into seven offices.
   The offices to be closed are in Hamilton Township, N.J.,
Cincinnati, Greensboro, N.C., Oakton, Va., and Fairhaven, Mass.
   The remaining offices are in Denver, Kansas City, Mo., Mesa,
Ariz., Orlando, Fla., Bridgewater, N.J., and Knightsbridge, N.J.

<HEAD>Bass Buyout Offer for St. Petersburg Newspaper Rejected</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAT LEISNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $270 million buyout offer for the
company that publishes the St. Petersburg Times, one of the South's
most prominent newspapers, was flatly rejected Friday by trustees
who told an investor group led by Texas billionaire Robert M. Bass
that the newspaper was not for sale.
   The Bass group responded immediately by saying the fight with
the Times wasn't over.
   Trustees of the Poynter Institute, a journalism school that owns
controlling stock in Times Publishing Co., voted unanimously to
turn down the bid made last month. The company publishes the
newspaper and Congressional Quarterly.
   ``The trustees carefully considered the institute's educational
purpose and concluded it was better to own a newspaper than a stack
of Treasury bills,'' said Andrew Barnes, chairman of the board of
trustees and editor, president and chief executive of the newspaper.
   ``The institute's ownership interest in the Times is not for
sale,'' Barnes said.
   The institute was set up by the late Nelson Poynter who ran the
paper for 30 years before his death in 1978.
   ``In light of previous statements by Mr. Barnes and his unique
capacity to make decisions for both the Times Publishing Co. and
the institute, this announcement is not unexpected,'' said David
Bonderman, a general partner and spokesman for the Texas investors.
   Through a complicated ownership plan the not-for-profit school
ultimately is the majority stockholder of the newspaper. Some
shares are owned by Poynter's widow, Marion, who endorsed the
institute's action, calling it the only decision that could have
been made.
   ``Nelson spent the better part of a lifetime assembling defenses
against assaults such as these,'' Mrs. Poynter said.
   ``Just because the attacks have become more sophisticated and
the weapons gold-plated there is no reason to give up the battle
for independence, integrity and commitment to the larger
community.''
   The Bass group, which bought a minority stake in the company
from disgruntled Poynter heirs in mid-1988, offered $270 million _
$90,000 for each of 3,000 shares of common stock.
   The partnership controls 200 shares _ or 40 percent _ of the
voting stock which earns 5.7 percent of the company's dividends.
   In another action, the Bass group has filed suit in federal
court for a bigger share of the dividends, which they claim aren't
fairly distributed in breach of fiduciary trust to stockholders.
   ``As fiduciaries for all of the common shareholders, the Board
of Times Publishing simply cannot pay dividends of $3.7 million per
year on preferred stock owned by only one of the common
shareholders when the company can redeem the preferred stock at any
time for $318,000,'' Bonderman said.
   ``The issue remains, and we will, of course, continue to pursue
its resolution by whatever means are available to us,'' Bonderman
said.

<HEAD>Black Investors Settle Baltimore Cable TV Set-Aside Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two black investors, who claimed a cable
television company failed to live up to a minority set-aside clause
in its agreement with the city, have agreed to a settlement that
could be worth $100 million.
   United Cable Television Corp. of Baltimore agreed to the
settlement Monday, midway through a trial brought by the two
investors.
   The plaintiffs contended that the cable company blocked them and
other minority investors from obtaining a 25 percent ownership
interest in the franchise as required by the special set-aside
provision of the original franchise won from the city.
   The two investors, Clarence Elder, a Baltimore businessman, and
O. Patrick Scott, a Prince George's County public school art
teacher, will receive an immediate $8.7 million lump-sum payment.
   In addition, United Cable will transfer to them more than 2,100
units, or shares, in United's investment partnership that
underwrites the cable system.
   Those units, in addition to 311 they already own, could be worth
up to $92.3 million by 1995 if Scott and Elder decide to sell them
that year, according to court estimates cited by attorneys for
Scott and Elder.
   United Cable officials put the total settlement figure at about
$50 million.
   By whatever measure, ``the result is a great one,'' said Stephen
Snyder, chief attorney for Scott and Elder.
   Under the settlement, approved by Baltimore Circuit Judge Hilary
Caplan, Snyder's Baltimore law firm, Snyder, Mehlman and Wais, will
receive 40 percent of the cash and stock paid out to Scott and
Elder.
   In agreeing to the settlement, United Cable acknowledged no
wrongdoing.
   ``It was a business dispute, and that's the way we looked at it
from the beginning,'' said John Neal, a vice president of United
Artists Entertainment Co., the Denver-based parent of United Cable.
   Elder and Scott claimed in their lawsuit that United Cable
resorted to various subterfuges to limit minority ownership
interest in the franchise to about 3.5 percent, rather than the 25
percent required by the city.
   Neal said the ownership issue was ``clouded'' by varying
interpretations of the franchise agreement and by ``the inability
(of black investors) to raise the money in the full amount for
their 25 percent interest.''

<HEAD>Steel Imports Down, Exports Up in 1989</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Steel imports declined in 1989 and exports
rose substantially, an industry group reported Friday.
   The American Iron and Steel Institute said both figures reflect
the greater competitiveness of American steel in the domestic and
world markets. The group cited production efficiencies in the U.S.
industry and continuous strong demand for steel in the world market.
   According to the group's compilation of U.S. Commerce Department
figures, imports of steel-mill products last year were 17.3 million
net tons. That marks a decrease from the 20.9 million tons imported
in 1988.
   Steel exports totalled 4.6 million tons in 1989, which was up
from the 2.1 million tons exported the previous year, the group
said.
   The 1989 export figure was the highest since a steel boom year
in 1974, the institute said. The post-World War II high for exports
was 7.1 million tons in 1970.

<HEAD>Nordstrom Stock Falls As Company Faces Labor Orders, Lower
Revenues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATIA BLACKBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hit with a double-whammy of lower revenue
projections and an order by the state of Washington to stop
breaking wage laws, Nordstrom Inc. stock fell 9.2 percent Friday,
from $32.50 to $29.50 per share.
   The retail chain announced Thursday that its fourth-quarter
earnings, to be released in a few days, will be lower than earnings
for the same period a year earlier.
   Also Thursday, the state Department of Labor and Industries
ordered Nordstrom to pay two years' worth of unpaid overtime to its
hourly employees in Washington state, a decision that eventually
could affect all 30,000 employees of the department store operator
nationwide.
   Ruling on a complaint filed by Locals 1001 and 367, United Food
and Commercial Workers in Seattle and Tacoma, the state labor
department found that Nordstrom violated the state Minimum Wage Act.
   Nordstrom could be liable for $40 million in claims and
penalties in Washington state alone, and for $300 million in
California, Local 1001 president Joe Peterson said Friday at a news
conference. The union did not immediately provide projections for
possible claims in other states.
   Peterson said a class-action suit on behalf of Nordstrom
employees nationwide would be filed against the chain if it doesn't
comply with the state order.
   Bruce Nordstrom, co-chairman of the company's board of
directors, said in a Friday news release: ``We will be reviewing
our record-keeping procedures and making any necessary back-pay
adjustments for those Washington employees who may be affected by
the department's findings.
   ``However, comments by the union representatives about the
financial impact of those pay adjustments are purely speculative
and we believe greatly overstated.''
   According to the labor department and the union, Nordstrom
consistently encourages employees to volunteer their time for such
activities as attending company meetings, preparing paperwork and
inventory, and making customer deliveries.
   The department ordered Nordstrom to start proper record-keeping
for the hours its employees works and offer back pay to those who
have put in unpaid overtime.
   ``Nordstrom is doing a disservice to its reputation, employees
and stockholders by continuing to deny that they have a culture ...
that requires employees to work without pay,'' Peterson said Friday.
   The alleged practice forces employees to work unpaid hours to
improve their sales per hour, he said. Those who don't participate
see their hours cut and don't get promoted, he claimed.
   The technique, he added, gives Nordstrom an unfair competitive
advantage.
   ``Nordstrom has a great reputation for customer service and
merchandising. There is no reason why they can't continue to be
that but, like other employers, pay their employees,'' he said.
   Nordsrom spokeswoman Kellie Tormey said Friday that any
implication that employees who don't work unpaid overtime aren't
promoted is ``absolutely false.''
   She also said Nordstrom had always provided employees with extra
pay for extra work and if that weren't the case, she asked
rhetorically, why did so many employees stay with the company?
   The union has collected 450 claims for $2.1 million in back pay
and expects more now because of the state order, Peterson said.
   Marcia Raley, who follows Nordstrom for the Dain Bosworth Inc.
brokerage in Minneapolis, said she thinks the earnings projection
is more responsible for the market decline than the labor
department order. However, she said, Nordstrom's response to the
order will make a difference in the future.
   She estimated that Nordstrom's fourth-quarter earnings per share
were 48 cents, down from 58 cents a year earlier. Her guess on
year-end results is $1.47 a share, down from $1.51 a year earlier.
   Nordstrom has 60 stores in Washington, California, Oregon, Utah,
Virginia and Alaska. It plans 16 more stores in Oregon, California,
New Jersey, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Indiana, Connecticut,
Massachusetts and New York.
   The Seattle-based chain, closely held by the Nordstrom family,
has prospered in recent years in part because of its reputation for
customer service.
