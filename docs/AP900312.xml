   Cesar Gaviria Trujillo, who wants to
eliminate drug trafficking, end government corruption and help the
poor, was easily leading in the presidential primary of the
governing Liberal Party, according to election results late Monday.
   Besides the presidential primary, Colombians also chose a
congress, mayors, city councilmen and state assemblies in Sunday's
elections.
   Presidential elections take place May 26.
   With 43 percent of the total vote counted, the National
Elections Office said Gaviria had 1,310,000 votes, or 48 percent of
the total cast for all six Liberal Party presidential candidates.
In second place was former Bogota Mayor Hernando Duran with 636,593
votes, or 23 percent; third was Sen. Ernesto Samper with 488,297
votes, or 18 percent.
   Vote tallying was delayed because the computer system broke
down, and counting proceeded by hand in this South American country
of 30 million people.
   The major radio networks RCN and Caracol said exit polls
indicated two former guerrillas won mayoral contests in small towns.
   Gaviria was campaign manager of Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, a
popular presidential candidate who was slain in Bogota last Aug. 18
by drug traffickers.
   With the only other major contender, the Conservative Party,
weakened by infighting and represented by Rodrigo Lloreda, 47, who
has failed two previous attempts to be president, there is little
doubt Gaviria will be elected.
   At 43, Gaviria would be Colombia's youngest president ever.
   The choice of the Liberal Party's presidential candidate was the
most important part of the elections as Colombia faces threats from
drug traffickers, leftist guerrillas and right wing death squads.
   Samper and the other Liberal Party contenders for the
presidential nomination had indicated they wanted to negotiate with
drug traffickers and end the 6-month-old war between drug barons
and government security forces.
   One Liberal Party presidential aspirant, Alberto Santofimio, who
took the most vigorous anti-U.S. position, called for an end to the
war against traffickers.
   Gaviria acknowledged late Sunday that his probable victory
stemmed from Galan's popularity. He promised to follow Galan's
program of attempting to wipe out drug trafficking.
   However, he suggested he may prefer to try drug traffickers in
Colombia rather than send them to the United States for trials,
something the traffickers fear greatly.
   Gaviria also promised to follow Galan's programs for a more
equitable justice system, which usually favors the wealthy and
influential, and to try to create more schools, jobs, housing, and
better living conditions for the poor.
   Previous Colombian presidents have not given much importance to
solving problems of the poor. Failure to face those problems has
resulted in rapid growth of leftist guerrilla insurrection.
   It was the first time the Liberal Party leaders did not choose
the presidential candidate. Usually the choice is based upon
reports from local powerbrokers who show they can deliver votes.
   According to exit polls by networks, the Liberal Party appeared
to have won 60 percent of the seats in the 313-member congress. The
Conservative Party appeared headed for 37 percent of the seats,
while leftist parties are expected to win 3 percent, RCN and
Caracol said.
   Currently, congressional seats have a breakdown of 57 percent
Liberal and 37 percent Conservative, with the balance held by
leftists.
   Former leftist guerrillas of the April 19 Movement appeared to
have won two of the 1,005 mayoral races, RCN and Caracol said.
   The group, known as the M19, surrendered its weapons last week
in an impressive ceremony that marked the first time a guerrilla
organization voluntarily ended its violence in Colombia's three
decades of armed insurrection.
   There are five other guerrilla groups, none of which reached
peace terms with the government.
   Juan Caicedo, a Liberal, was elected mayor in the capital
Bogota, a city of 6 million people, according to the radio reports.
   President Virgilio Barco ends his four-year term Aug. 7. By law,
he is ineligible to run for a second consecutive term.

   Gov. Gaston Caperton made some progress
with union officials Monday in a bid to end West Virginia's first
teacher strike, a spokesman said.
   Earlier in the day, about 1,000 teachers and their supporters
rallied at the Capitol, and one county threatened to fire teachers
who don't return to work.
   Caperton met with Kayetta Meadows, president of the
16,000-member West Virginia Education Association, and Bob Brown,
president of the 3,000-member West Virginia Federation of Teachers,
behind closed doors for about seven hours. The meeting ended at 11
p.m.
   Caperton spokesman G.C. Morse said no agreement had been reached
to end the strike, but the two sides were closer to a settlement
than they have been in the past few days.
   Morse declined to elaborate on the talks. He said discussions
would resume at 7 a.m. Tuesday. Brown would not comment after the
meeting, and Meadows said only that she was tired but willing to
continue talks.
   ``It is my hope and desire that we can put aside the harsh words
and miscommunications of the past weekend and move on to the
resolution of the present predicament,'' Caperton said in a news
release issued before the meeting. ``I hope that this discussion
will be framed in realistic and practical terms.''
   As the meeting continued inside the Capitol, hundreds of
teachers clad in red as a sign of solidarity gathered outside under
a huge banner reading, ``Governor, Lead Us. Don't Fight Us.''
   ``This isn't fun, but it is necessary,'' said Keith Geiger,
president of the 2 million-member National Education Association,
with which the WVEA is affiliated. ``You must stick together until
a resolution is there.''
   Teachers went on strike last Wednesday after the governor failed
to provide educators with a raise in his 1990-91 proposed budget.
   By Monday, the strike had spread to 46 of the state's 55
counties, forcing officials in 29 counties to cancel classes for
nearly 150,000 of the state's 328,445 pupils.
   The meeting came after talks between the two sides broke down
over the weekend.
   Leaders of the education association said they had been ready to
call off the walkout Saturday, but urged members to remain on
strike, accusing the governor of reneging on the terms of a
settlement.
   The teachers said they won't go back to work until the governor
promises to call a special legislative session to consider pay
raises. The governor said he won't call a special session until the
teachers go back to work.
   Assocation members voted Saturday on a proposal to return to
work for 30 days, during which time Caperton would call a special
session.
   But Caperton termed ``a total lie'' any claim that he promised
to call such a session. Meadows said the governor gave teachers no
choice but to stay on strike.
   In Greenbrier County in the southeastern section of the state,
the Board of Education told striking teachers Monday they would be
fired if they didn't return to work by Wednesday.
   State Attorney General Roger Tompkins said last week the
teachers strike is illegal and teachers could be fired or otherwise
disciplined.
   In Jefferson County in the northeast, Circuit Judge Thomas
Steptoe issued an injunction ordering county teachers to return to
classrooms by Thursday,
   The county Board of Education asked for the injunction after
teachers there voted to go on strike last Thursday. Steptoe said
teachers could be fined and held in contempt of court if they
didn't return by the deadline.
   Carolyn Spangler, a spokeswoman for the state board of
education, said she knew of no similar action at county or state
levels.
   In Ohio County in the northern panhandle, classes were canceled
when officials found most of the district's 47 school buses had
flat tires, said Superintendent H. Lawrence Jones. Jones said it
was unclear who was responsible.
   In classrooms and on picket lines, teachers blasted Caperton and
the news media, saying a failure to communicate has been a major
problem in settling the strike.
   At Charleston's Capitol High School, only about 400 of the
school's 1,300 students showed up for classes.
   ``I don't like it because we've been wasting our time,'' said
Shawna Adkins, a sophomore at Capitol. ``All we do is watch movies,
and we can do that at home.''

<TEXT>
   The five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council met privately Monday in their third round of discussions
since January on a formula to end the 11-year-old Cambodian civil
war.
   The diplomats from France, the United States, Soviet Union,
China and Britain were expected to focus on the failure of a
meeting of the four warring factions two weeks ago.
   In January, the five Security Council members supported large
parts of an Australian plan to put Cambodia under U.N.
administration until free elections were held. They met again in
New York last month.
   Analysts believe the Australian plan offers the best chance in
years of ending the conflict, but the meeting of the combatants in
Jakarta, Indonesia, produced no agreement on major issues.
   Factions involved are the government of Premier Hun Sen,
installed by Vietnam, and the resistance coalition of three parties
_ the Khmer Rouge, a Communist group that is the strongest
guerrilla organization, and non-Communist insurgent forces led by
Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Cambodia's former ruler, and Son Sann, a
former premier.
   Hun Sen and Vietnam's foreign minister, Nguyen Co Thach, said
one reason the Jakarta talks failed was the opposition of Khieu
Samphan, a Khmer Rouge leader and vice president of the guerrilla
coalition, to using the word ``genocide'' to describe Khmer Rouge
rule of Cambodia in 1975-78.
   The Khmer Rouge government led by Pol Pot, killed hundreds of
thousands of Cambodia's 8 million people in the process of trying
to create a new agrarian society. A Vietnamese invasion in December
1978 overthrew the Pol Pot regime.
   Australia's plan also is intended to break a deadlock at the
19-nation Paris talks in August, which foundered largely on the
question of how power could be shared until election. The
Australians suggested sidestepping the question by putting the
country under an interim U.N. administration, with peacekeeping
forces to police a cease-fire.
   All factions appear to accept some U.N. role, including election
supervision, but there is disagreement over how Cambodia should be
governed until the elections are held.
   Hun Sen and his Vietnamese backers say dismantling his
government might open the way for the Khmer Rouge to seize power
again.
   Sihanouk and Son Sann have welcomed the Australian proposal.
Khmer Rouge spokesmen have expressed reservations about it, but
have not taken a formal position.
   Under the Australian plan, the former French colony's U.N. seat
would be declared vacant until a new government was formed in Phnom
Penh after elections. The plan would cost an estimated $987 million
for a year and involve 12,190 peacekeepers and outside officials.
   Attending the Paris talks are Richard Solomon, U.S.
undersecretary of state; David Gillmore, undersecretary in the
British Foreign Office; Claude Martin, France's director of Asian
affairs; Igor Rogachev of the Soviet Union and Xu Dunxin of China,
vice ministers of foreign affairs; and Rafeeuden Ahmed, a U.N.
assistant secretary-general.

   A high school art teacher shot his wife and
daughters to death as they slept Monday, then killed himself,
authorities said.
   Grade school principal Dean Collins asked the sheriff's office
to check on the family when Joe Pianalto, 33, didn't report for
work and his daughters, Annie, 8, and Jennifer, 6, didn't report to
school.
   Sheriff Don Panzer said he found Shirley Pianalto, 35, dead in
her bed with a gunshot wound to the back of the head. The children
were in their bed, also dead of head wounds.
   Pianalto's body was behind the girl's bed, a hunting rifle at
his side, Panzer said. The teacher's wound appeared to be
self-inflicted, the sheriff said.
   The county coroner, Dr. Leo Meduna, estimated that the deaths
occurred between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. Monday.
   ``Everybody is just absolutely horrified about what has taken
place here,'' Panzer said. ``What we're trying to find out is what
possibly could have triggered him to do such a thing.''
   The family moved to this north-central Kansas town about 35
miles northwest of Salina three or four years ago.
   The last homicide in this rural community of about 1,600 people
occurred in 1977, when a Missouri fugitive held a couple and their
teen-age son hostage for several hours before shooting them and
killing himself, Panzer said.

of cardiac arrest at 84.
   Raborn, a retired Navy vice admiral, was appointed by President
Johnson to head the Central Intelligence Agency in 1965. He was
succeed by Richard Helms, his deputy, the following year.
   An aviator, Raborn served aboard aircraft carriers in World War
II and commanded the carrier Bennington after the war.
   In 1955, he was chosen to head Navy missile development and
brought in the nuclear-tipped Polaris missile on time and on
budget. It was the first solid-fuel long-range missile launchable
from a submerged submarine.
   Raborn died March 6 at Sibley Hospital, according to obituaries
published Tuesday.
   He is survived by his wife, two children and four grandchildren.

   Deposed Haitian leader Prosper Avril stopped at a
U.S. Air Force base Monday before flying to an unknown destination
as Haitian exiles cautiously celebrated his ouster and called for
his execution.
   Avril, a lieutenant general, and his family arrived aboard a
U.S. C-141 transport plane at Homestead Air Force Base 25 miles
south of Miami at 8:20 a.m., and left at 3:30 p.m.
   Avril departed in ``personally arranged transportation,'' said
Maj. Bob Barca, a Homestead spokesman. He declined to comment
further.
   A U.S. government official, speaking on condition he not be
identified, said Avril left Florida. Asked if he was flown out, the
official responded: ``That would be correct.''
   Lt. Col. Darrell Hayes, an Air Force spokesman in Washington,
said earlier that Avril was going to be driven to Boca Raton and
left ``on his own'' after reaching the affluent Palm Beach County
city. But city officials said they were assured by federal
officials that Avril wasn't coming there.
   Area Haitians said Avril's son attended college in Miami until
recently and moved to a home west of Boca Raton, the Sun-Sentinel
in Fort Lauderdale reported Tuesday.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said earlier that Avril
indicated he planned to stay in the Miami area ``a few days,'' and
that his future was still under discussion.
   A group of Haitian exiles demonstrated briefly outside the U.S.
attorney's office in Miami to call for Avril's indictment. Dozens
more gathered outside the Haitian Refugee Center in Miami's Little
Haiti neighborhood, listening to radio reporters and speakers.
   ``Avril Pa Mourin (Avril Isn't Dead!),'' some chanted in Haitian
Creole, the French-African language spoken by most Haitians. Most
speakers called for Avril's capture, trial in Haiti and execution
for allegedly ordering the slayings of civilians and opposition
leaders.
   The crowd became larger and livelier as nightfall neared, but
the overall mood seemed more anxious than boisterous after four
years of instability and dashed hopes in their Caribbean homeland.
The mood contrasted with near-riotous celebrations that broke out
on Feb. 7, 1986, when Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier fled Haiti,
ending his family's 29-year rule.
   ``Everybody is happy, but we are still watching,'' said Pierre
Joseph, 30, who said he's been in Florida 10 years. ``Nothing
changed yet. Maybe if we have elections, then it will change.''
   A dozen Haitians stood vigil outside the Homestead base gates
when word began circulating that Avril was on his way.
   ``We're here to tell him he's not welcome in this society, in
this country,'' said exile Jean-Pierre Louis. ``We want him to be
tried and imprisoned and even executed like Ceaucescu in Romania.''
   Louis said U.S. hospitality for Avril was unwelcome. But the
Rev. Gerard Jean-Juste, a longtime, fiery leader in the south
Florida exile community that numbers at least 150,000, urged ``cool
heads.''
   Leading the demonstration outside the U.S. attorney's office, he
said Avril should be indicted and jailed on drug charges as was
deposed Panama leader Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, in federal
custody near here since his own arrival at Homestead on Jan. 4.
   The Haitian military has been linked to shipments of South
American cocaine to Florida, but there has been no indication that
U.S. authorities might charge Avril.
   ``As far as any charges are concerned, this office will attempt
to bring an indictment if there is sufficient evidence and
information to justify it,'' said Diane Cossin, executive assistant
to U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen. She suggested anyone with such
information turn it over to the Drug Enforcement Administration.
   Jean-Juste twice this year led demonstrations at Miami
International Airport when Avril was in transit during an official
visit to Taiwan. The exiles there were ordered by police to
disperse after threatening to grab Avril and take him to Little
Haiti for a people's trial.
   ``I am very optimistic this time. I think there are new factors
in the equation,'' Jean-Juste said.
   He said he was most encouraged by the apparent role the U.S.
ambassador, State Department and White House played in easing Avril
out. Many Haitian exiles have expressed bitterness about U.S.
policy toward Haiti and Haitian immigration, which is to consider
most Haitians attempting to leave their impoverished nation to be
economic refugees and subject to deportation.
   ``This is a miracle for us to see many of the U.S. officials
helping get the rights of the Haitian people,'' Jean-Juste said.
   He said Haitians were trying to learn more about Ertha
Pascal-Trouillot, the Supreme Court judge designated by the
opposition coalition to head a provisional civilian government.
   She had ties to the Duvalier regime, Jean-Juste said, but added,
``If the Haitian people accept her, we will accept her. We will be
very cautious.''
   He doubted there would be a mass reverse exodus to Haiti if
democracy comes. He said Haiti doesn't have the infrastructure to
support a surge of returning exiles, most of whom send U.S. dollars
home. Jean-Juste said he would encourage exiles to go back
temporarily to help, and to take goods not available in Haiti.

<HEAD>Expert Says Toxicologist Can't Tell if Hazelwood Was Drunk</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Was Joseph Hazelwood drunk or sober
when the Exxon Valdez ran aground? A defense witness said a
toxicologist for the prosecution probably can't tell because
``there are too many unknown variables.''
   Thomas Burr, an alcohol and drug testing consultant from
Minneapolis, noted Monday that Hazelwood underwent only one blood
test 10{ hours after the grounding and it is not known whether he
drank after the grounding.
   Burr, called by the defense, criticized conclusions reached by
Richard Prouty, an Oklahoma toxicologist who testified Hazelwood
probably was drunk when his tanker rammed a jagged reef in the
nation's worst oil spill.
   Prouty used a method known as ``retrograde extrapolation,''
which seeks to determine a person's drunkenness at an earlier hour
through backward calculations based on blood tests.
   But Burr said he's never heard of anyone counting backwards 10{
hours with only one blood test.
   ``It's very dubious when it's based on a single chemical test,''
he said. ``In my opinion, it's not a valid thing to do forensically
especially not for such a long period of time. ... There are too
many unknown variables.''
   Burr said the method is controversial in the scientific
community.
   Taking Prouty's calculations to their extreme, Burr said they
could have shown that Hazelwood had a .30 blood alcohol reading
when he boarded the ship, making him unable to walk straight.
   ``At levels of .30, 100 percent of people are visibly and
noticeably intoxicated,'' Burr said. He faced cross-examination
today.
   Witnesses have said Hazelwood was steady on his feet and except
for liquor on his breath showed no signs of intoxication after a
day ashore in Valdez. There is a conflict in testimony on how much
he drank while in town.
   Earlier Monday, another defense expert witness, Shiras Walker,
testified under cross-examination that the grounding of the massive
tanker would not have occurred if Hazelwood had stayed on the
bridge.
   But Walker, a former tanker captain, said the skipper's
departure to his quarters was not unusual and did not cause the
disaster. Walker said if he had things to do below and had an able
third mate, he wouldn't hesitate to leave, either.
   ``I walked several thousand miles in Captain Hazelwood's
shoes,'' the experienced seaman said.
   Ultimately, Walker blamed third mate Gregory Cousins for the
wreck. He suggested it was Cousins' job to see that Hazelwood's
orders were followed by the helmsman, who failed to carry out the
ordered 10-degree right rudder turn.
   ``Probably anybody above the age of 5 could have carried that
out,'' the witness said.
   If there were problems, Walker said, the third mate had a
telephone to call Hazelwood in his cabin. ``All he had to say was,
`Captain, come to the bridge,' and this whole thing would have been
avoided,'' he testified.
   Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y., was the only crew member of
the Exxon Valdez charged in the wreck, which spilled nearly 11
million gallons of oil.
   He is accused of criminal mischief, reckless endangerment,
operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent discharge of
oil. If convicted, he could receive up to 7\ years in prison and
$61,000 in fines.
   ``Isn't it true that if Captain Hazelwood was on the bridge
where he was supposed to be, this wouldn't have happened?''
Assistant District Attorney Mary Anne Henry asked during
cross-examination.
   ``I might disagree with that `supposed to be' part,'' said
Walker. ``But if Captain Hazelwood was on the bridge during those
maneuvers, this accident wouldn't have happened.''
   But when defense attorney Michael Chalos asked whether he felt
Hazelwood's absence from the bridge contributed to the disaster in
any way, the witness responded, ``None at all.''
   The former captain told jurors the only regulation he knows of
requiring a captain to be on the bridge is during passage through
the Panama Canal.

<HEAD>White House Endorses Higher-Cost Project</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House has agreed an $8 billion super
collider is ``well worth'' building but taxpayers, not foreign
countries, will probably pick up most of the extra $2 billion cost,
Deputy Energy Secretary W. Henson Moore said Monday.
   Moore said the Energy Department does not expect Texas to
contribute beyond the $1 billion it has pledged toward building the
particle accelerator south of Dallas, and is also not counting on
much more foreign help than was expected when the collider's price
was $5.9 billion.
   The department said last year that it expected to finance
one-third of the then-$5.9 billion project, which would be the
world's largest scientific instrument, through non-federal sources
_ $1 billion from Texas and close to another $1 billion from
foreign countries.
   Design changes have since forced the price up as high as $8
billion, Moore said, although the Energy Department won't have a
firm figure until July or August.
   The collider is a 53-miles around tunnel that will whirl beams
of protons into each other to test exotic theories on the origin of
matter.
   At a meeting Friday at the White House with Moore, Energy
Secretary James D. Watkins and three presidential advisers, it was
determined that ``we did not think it was possible to gain more
(non-federal money) than what we had contemplated,'' Moore said.
   ``And so we concluded to that meeting at the White House the
increase will be soley borne by the federal government, and there
was little chance, if any, of that increase would come from any
place else,'' Moore told a news conference.
   The three advisers at the meeting were John Sununu, White House
chief of staff, Richard Darman, director of the Office of
Management and Budget, and Allan Bromley, assistant to the
president for science and technology.

sheltering children from the streets, the nation's largest program
for young runaways is struggling with another troubled life: its
own.
   Torn by allegations of sexual impropriety that forced the
resignation of its charismatic founder, the $87 million-a-year
operation has postponed some expansion plans and steeled itself for
a drop in donations.
   The scrutiny also has revealed criticism from a new source:
social welfare professionals who question its style of service.
   Critics agree Covenant House helps fill the urgent need of
sheltering homeless youths; each night, about 2,000 runaways sleep
in its centers in six U.S. cities, Latin America and Canada.
   But some say Covenant House's main thrust _ short-term stays in
institutional settings _ represents triage rather than treatment.
Others complain that its Roman Catholic philosophy precludes sex
education that could help stem the spread of AIDS.
   Some critics accuse its counselors of harassing homosexual
youths, and others charge the organization with institutional
arrogance, saying it virtually ignores other privately operated
programs.
   ``They fill the hallways and then call the press in and say,
`There's kids on the floor, we need more money,''' said Marion
Reidel, clinical director at the Emergency Shelter, a much smaller
program for runaways in New York. ``They're notorious for not
networking with the other programs in town.''
   Since December, a series of former clients has stepped forward
to accuse Covenant House's 62-year-old founder, the Rev. Bruce
Ritter, of sexual misconduct.
   One youth claimed to have received money and gifts from Ritter,
and Covenant House has conceded trying to start him off in a new
life by giving him the identity of a dead 10-year-old boy, without
asking the dead boy's parents. Ritter has denied wrongdoing, but
Franciscan officials ordered him to take a leave of absence while
they investigated. On Feb. 27, he resigned. The next day,
prosecutors said they had found ``questionable financial
transactions'' at Covenant House, but none meriting prosecution.
   Covenant House gets 95 percent of its funds from private
donations, relying on appeals written by Ritter and mailed monthly
to 800,000 past or potential supporters.
   Donations fell, recovered and fell again as the allegations
surfaced and subsided. Now Covenant House officials are uncertain _
and deeply worried _ about the effect of Ritter's departure.
   ``There's a real question as to whether Covenant House will be
able to grow and expand as it has, or whether Covenant House will
be put into a period of retrenchment for some time,'' said Frank
Macchiarola, who served briefly as acting president before
resigning, also on Feb. 27, because of friction with the
organization's board.
   Covenant House operates large shelters in New York; New Orleans;
Houston; Los Angeles; Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; Anchorage, Alaska; and
Toronto, and orphanage-style shelters in Mexico, Honduras,
Guatemala and Panama.
   Plans to establish a shelter in Washington are on hold, but
expansions in Los Angeles and New Orleans are proceeding and a
counseling center in Dallas just opened.
   Despite the organization's longstanding practice of spending
almost all of each year's income, Covenant House officials said its
finances are basically sound and no cutbacks are envisioned.
   But the criticism of its programs appears likely to continue.
   ``We have this kind of mixed feeling toward the Covenant
House,'' said Fred Griesbach, head of the Coalition for the
Homeless.
   While the rate of AIDS is ``astronomical'' among runaways,
Greisbach said, Covenant House does not encourage using condoms to
stem the disease's spread but instead counsels abstinence.
   ``They're not going to deal with it in what I think is a
rational way,'' he said. ``We think it's counterproductive. You
need to talk about condoms, about abortion, about birth control
that goes beyond abstinence.''
   Macchiarola said Covenant House's handling of birth control and
sex education is guided by principle. ``The policy we follow is
church policy,'' he said. ``We have to proceed off what we think is
right.''
   Covenant House's main purpose is to provide emergency shelter
for a few days or weeks to runaways who often return to the street.
But critics say smaller, more intensive programs have more success
helping youngsters find a new life.
   ``Young people are supposed to be in a family-type
environment,'' Reidel said. ``They're not supposed to be
institutionalized. They don't belong in large buildings.''
   Covenant House's Manhattan shelter, in tawdry Times Square,
fails to remove youngsters from the dangers and temptations of
street life and is too big for effective individual counseling, she
said.
   The Manhattan shelter was designed for 250 youths but often
sleeps more than 300, some on roll-out pads in lounges. Macchiarola
said Covenant House's reluctance to refer youths elsewhere reflects
its open-door policy.
   ``The moment our people think they should refer kids elsewhere
is the moment we've taken a different attitude,'' he said.
   After a brief stay, two-thirds of the shelter's visitors return
to the street, where some meet an early death from drugs, disease
or violence. The others return to families, find their own place to
live or enter long-term residential programs.
   Covenant House also operates a 150-bed long-term residence in
New York, and other organizations run similar, smaller programs.
   ``And there are advantages to that smallness,'' said Susan
Mullgrav, special projects director at the city Department of Youth
Services. ``It's more personalized. It's more individualized.''
   Yet given the scope of the problem _ with an estimated 100,000
to 300,000 homeless runaway youths nationwide _ Mullgrav and others
concede large shelters do fill the most urgent needs: A bed, a meal
and someone to talk to.
   ``Covenant House has been necessary, in spite of their
programmatic problems, because they're one of the few agencies that
has that number of beds,'' said Reidel. ``It is better than
sleeping on the streets.''

   They fought and suffered. They saw
their comrades killed and wounded and their own lives crippled by
bullets or bombs. Now they feel their sacrifice and achievement are
going unrecognized.
   ``Dona Violeta talks about everyone but us,'' complained
Commandante ``Wilmer,'' a regional chief of the Contra insurgency
based in the hills here on the border with Nicaragua.
   Nicaraguan President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, along
with President Daniel Ortega, has called for the Contras to
disband. But the Contras want more. They want credit.
   ``We're the ones who created the conditions for dialogue among
the Central American presidents,'' Wilmer said of last year's
regional summit meetings. The talks produced Sandinista concessions
on early elections and international scrutiny.
   Wilmer, like other Contras, argues that the Sandinistas made
concessions only because they wanted to get rid of the pressure of
the Contra resistance. Although U.S.-supported, the current Contra
leadership maintains it is a homegrown insurgency that grew out of
conditions created by the Sandinistas inside Nicaragua.
   Mrs. Chamorro, leading a 14-party alliance, trounced Ortega in
the Feb. 25 vote that grew out of the peace process. She is to take
office April 25.
   ``We have to be paid the respect due men who have spilled our
blood. Each combatant has to know his effort has not been for
nothing,'' said Wilmer, who uses only his nom-de-guerre.
   The Contras were defeated militarily but now feel they deserve
credit for what turned out to be a political victory.
   ``We'll return to Nicaragua when we're respected as combatants,
as part of the victory,'' said ``Jackson,'' another young
``commandante.''
   Asked what kind of appreciation the Contras want to see from
Mrs. Chamorro, Wilmer said they would like to praised in a speech.
``But it can't be limited to just words. The words should be backed
up with deeds.''
   He said the combatants, most of whom are peasant farmers, are
not looking for government positions or handouts. But they will
need financial help to rebuild their lives back home.
   Wilmer, 27 years old and a veteran of nine years of
counterrevolution, is a prime example of the new breed of Contra
chief. The movement's leadership was overhauled last year at the
insistence of men like him, who spent years in the mountains
fighting a war that killed an estimated 30,000 people.
   The business-suited Contra honchos who spent most of their time
lobbying in Washington, Miami and Tegucigalpa were pushed out.
   The field commanders viewed those leaders _ the ones the U.S.
public saw posing with Ronald Reagan or testifying in Congress _
for the most part as venal politicians insensitive to the needs and
objectives of the fighting man.
   Wilmer and the members of the revamped command spend most of
their time at this sprawling camp, home for the past two years to
about 10,000 fighters and 42,000 dependents. A few thousand Contra
combatants operate inside Nicaragua, where Wilmer spent several
months prior to his return to Yamales in late February.
   About 3,000 rebel soldiers gathered on a parade ground Thursday
to hear an address from Commander ``Ruben,'' the top Contra after
chief of staff Israel Galeano, known as ``Franklin.''
   Ruben told the troops that in the not-too-distant future, they
would parade into Managua to the cheers of a thankful throng.
   But just when or how the Contras will demobilize, and what will
become of them after they do, has emerged as the major stumbling
block to a peaceful transition in Nicaragua.
   The Sandinistas insist the rebel army must disarm and disband
before inauguration day.
   The Contras want none of that. They say they will remain armed
and ready to make sure the leftist regime hands over power _ the
army and the police forces _ as well as the presidential sash. They
also want their safety inside Nicaragua guaranteed.
   But Honduras wants them out. The United States agrees they must
demobilize. And Mrs. Chamorro has limited her contact to an envoy,
who in the sleepy Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa declared the
president-elect's ``recognition'' of their contribution. It was
eminently low profile.
   ``We are a cancer nobody wants,'' said Galeano early this month.
   ``There's no confetti and no medals,'' said a U.S. official
close to the Contras. ``They sought a military satisfaction and
weren't prepared for a political satisfaction, which is more
problematical as relates to them.''
   The official said Contra leaders complain they are as
unappreciated as Vietnam veterans were after that war ended.
   ``When they say that I always tell them: `But there's a big
difference. In this case, your side won.'''

   A year ago, Islamic fundamentalist Ahmed
Kofahi had been dismissed as a university teacher and was in prison
for criticizing the government. Now he's a member of Parliament.
   Kofahi is heard regularly in state radio broadcasts of
parliamentary debates, excoriating assorted government officials.
   His progress from prisoner to legislator illustrates the quiet
changes Jordan has undergone the past year.
   ``The atmosphere's different now,'' Kofahi said in an interview.
``We have more freedom, but it's not enough.''
   Islamic fundamentalists and leftists who won seats in the
November elections are pressing for tough investigations of
government corruption, greater social justice and curbs on security
agencies.
   Human rights ``are born before the human is born,'' Kofahi said.
``It's not a gift from a leader or a party or an authority, and not
to have these rights is equivalent to death.''
   Jordan is bordered to the north and east by Syria and Iraq,
whose ruling parties brook little opposition. Kuwait, the most
liberal state on the Arabian Peninsula to the south, suspended its
parliament in 1987.
   ``I'm sure the countries surrounding us are not happy about
what's going on here,'' said Taher Masri, who resigned from the
Cabinet to make a successful run for Parliament.
   Reform in this kingdom of 3.1 million people, whose western
neighbor is Israel, is more orderly and less sweeping than the
change revolutionizing Eastern Europe.
   As in Eastern Europe, however, popular revolt is behind it. Four
days of riots last April caused by price increases and other
grievances cost 10 lives and shocked King Hussein into action.
   Hussein, who has ruled since 1953, is relinquishing many powers,
but retains firm control and is personally popular.
   In November, he oversaw Jordan's first general elections since
1967, which were among the freest ever held in the Arab world.
   The fundamentalist Moslem Brotherhood won the largest bloc of
seats in the 80-member Parliament. Kofahi, running on the
Brotherhood ticket, got more votes than any of the other 650
candidates.
   Mudar Badran, Hussein's choice for prime minister, underwent an
extraordinary grilling by legislators about his personal finances
and professional record before winning a vote of confidence.
   Since last April, the government has freed all prisoners held
without charge and dozens convicted of political related crimes.
   Radicals who once took up arms against Hussein have been allowed
to return home, and the pervasive General Intelligence Department
has been stripped of its powers to withhold passports and bar
people from travel or employment.
   The government has promised to make officials accountable for
corruption. A former undersecretary of the Supply Ministry was
arrested last month in a graft investigation.
   Badran has promised to end martial law, imposed 23 years ago
because of the 1967 Middle East war, and appointed lawyers to
determine which of the decrees issued during that time should be
abolished.
   He also promised to repeal a 1935 defense law inherited from the
British mandate that allows officials to ignore many civil rights.
The law now is used more widely in Israel than in Jordan.
   Although the 33-year-old ban on political parties remains in
force, it was ignored during the election campaign. The government
says it will legalize parties after a new ``national charter'' of
principles is submitted to a referendum, probably this year.
   Police have not interfered with street demonstrations, which
have been few and small. A 1988 decree nationalizing newspapers was
canceled and they were returned to their former managers, but
government institutions retain majority ownership.
   ``The government is not involved in any way in restricting the
press,'' Information Minister Ibrahim Izzeddine said.
   All the changes have not been liberal. The victory of Islamic
fundamentalists set back campaigns for Western-style women's rights
and encouraged censorship on moral grounds.
   Masri, the former government minister, said he is convinced
Hussein ``will not retreat'' from reforms.
   Jordan has had parliaments since the 1920s. Most were weak, and
any that showed signs of independence were suspended.
   Since 1948, however, Jordan has gone from a land of peasants and
nomads with one high school to a nation that nearly equals Sweden
in the percentage of young people going to college or technical
school.
   With such an educated population, Masri said: ``You can't hide
anything anymore.''

   The sheriff of this mountain county says
he's stopped the old custom of giving away seized moonshine for
home remedies since his arrest, even though a grand jury has
refused to indict him.
   ``I ain't done nothing nobody else had done,'' said Madison
County Sheriff Dedrick Brown, who was arrested after giving friends
six half-gallon jars of ``white lightning'' in front of a state
investigator.
   His supporters, including Republican Gov. Jim Martin, say the
practice dates back a century or more and his arrest was
politically motivated. The arrest was made by agents of the State
Bureau of Investigation, which is headed by a Democrat.
   Not everyone in Madison County agrees, however, with the grand
jury's decision not to indict Brown on charges of destroying
criminal evidence.
   ``If he's crooked enough to give moonshine away in front of
somebody, what else is he doing?'' said Eddie Lemin. ``He's in a
respected position and he shouldn't be dealing with that stuff.
They ought to can him.''
   Ann Briggs doesn't like that the sheriff of a dry county was
caught giving away alcohol. ``Moonshine is dangerous,'' she said.
``I can't see giving it out for medicinal purposes.''
   Brown, 49, says since he took office in 1986 his moonshine
recipients have included three Superior Court judges. He would not
elaborate.
   ``As far as I'm concerned, I won't be reopening that
tradition,'' said the sheriff, who was arrested on Feb. 9, a month
after he seized 25 jugs of corn whiskey in a raid on a still.
   Brown, an imposing 6-foot-6 with a graying beard, was
fingerprinted in his own jail and released.
   Sam Googe, retired sheriff of nearby Mitchell County, says he
gave away moonshine after breaking illegal stills during a 20-year
career that began in 1946. ``It's been around as long as I can
remember,'' he said. ``The people thought it helped. I hope it
did.''
   An old-timer in Marshall verified the giveaway custom. ``They've
done that ever since I was a boy,'' said 82-year-old Isaac Gunter.
``A spoonful of liquor is the best blood builder there is.''
   The governor, who agreed that the arrest smacks of dirty
politics, said confiscated whiskey routinely was given to Charlotte
hospitals when he was a county commissioner and Davidson College
chemistry professor in the 1960s.
   ``About once every six months, they'd have an accumulated supply
of whiskey,'' said Martin. ``They'd check it to see there was no
wood alcohol in it _ methanol, which blinds you. And we'd vote to
give it to the hospitals, so they could use it for medicinal
purposes. Seriously.''
   Brown, born and raised in Marshall, which is about 20 miles
northwest of Asheville, remembers being given a concoction of honey
and corn whiskey when he was sick as a young boy.
   ``A couple of teaspoons of whiskey every couple of hours helps
keep the fever from dropping too fast,'' said Brown, who was
fighting a stubborn cold with white-whiskey tea during a recent
interview.
   The sheriff, a Republican who upset longtime Democratic Sheriff
E.Y. Ponder in 1986, is up for re-election in November. While he
has no GOP opposition in the May primary, three Democrats are
running.
   Brown said the arrest may help him in a county where Democrats
outnumber Republicans more than 2-1. ``It was all done to weaken me
so they could beat me,'' Brown said. ``Instead, it has given me
strength.''
   Ponder, 80, the county's Democratic Party leader, denies Brown's
allegation that he, too, gave away moonshine during his 34 years as
sheriff. ``I never on Earth gave away evidence, or whiskey
either,'' Ponder said.
   And he denies having a role in Brown's arrest: ``If he says or
implies that I had anything to do with it, he's either badly
misinformed or willfully lying.''
   Brown arrested Ponder last year after Ponder shot a man in the
back with a shotgun. Ponder, who said the shooting occurred during
a scuffle, was not indicted.
   ``The SBI had evidence that they were nine to 12 feet apart,''
Brown said.

<TEXT>
   Poor Bonn. For 41 years this sleepy
city on the banks of the Rhine has been trying to live down its
image as one of Europe's least exciting capitals.
   Now, West Germany's leaders are talking about making Berlin the
capital of a united Germany and Bonn residents are worried about
the future.
   ``My customers are politicians and the whole periphery around
them _ chauffeurs, secretaries and tourist groups who come to see
the government area,'' said Juergen Rausch, whose family has run a
newspaper kiosk across from Parliament since West Germany's
creation in 1949.
   Among Rausch's better-known customers are Chancellor Helmut Kohl
and Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher.
   ``The main source of my income would disappear if Bonn were no
longer the capital,'' said Rausch.
   Bonn, birthplace of Beethoven, has many qualities.
   Farm tractors occasionally clank along major streets in Bonn's
suburbs. Barges ply the Rhine and people stroll on pathways along
the easy-moving river.
   It's a homey place in many ways. There's the Maternus
restaurant, for example, whose owner drags out photo albums to show
customers pictures of some of her famous guests, including Ronald
Reagan, Kohl and Genscher.
   A stone statue of Beethoven broods over Muensterplatz, the
city's quiet cobblestoned main square, just a couple blocks away
from the colorful daily farmers' market.
   Bonn University, a former 18th-century palace with majestic
onion-shaped domes, is widely respected in the fields of science,
political science, history and law. Wolfgang Paul, who shared the
Nobel Prize for physics with two others last year, teaches and
studies atoms at the university.
   But it's not fun city.
   Bonn has never been able to cast off its image as a provincial
capital. On Saturday nights, as many say, the nightlife is a
20-minute autobahn drive away in Cologne.
   ``Bonn is half the size of a Chicago cemetery, and twice as
dead,'' goes one old joke.
   Bonn's image isn't helped much by uninspired government
buildings that lack the grandeur of structures in London or Paris.
   Bonn has 290,000 residents counting politicians, government
workers, bureaucrats and diplomats, who live in the city because it
is the capital. Berlin, Germany's seat of government from 1871
until 1945, is a vibrant, cosmopolitan city of 1.8 million.
   Berlin became a key Hanseatic League trading center in the 14th
century, and later the seat of powerful Prussian kings. It emerged
as a center of German national feeling after the Napoleonic wars
and rose to become one of the world's great cities before the 1933
Nazi takeover.
   Unlike Bonn, Berlin has many famous monuments and architectural
treasures, like the former Reichstag building and Brandenburg Gate.
   Bonn has been a stand-in capital since 1949, with the idea that
when German unification occurs Berlin would regain the capital
crown it lost as a result of the Third Reich's defeat and Germany's
postwar separation.
   Now, with heady talk of reunification, West Germany's leaders
have been saying the capital of a united Germany rightfully belongs
in Berlin.
   ``Berlin is the city in which the heart _ and for which the
heart _ of the Germans beats,'' says Genscher.
   ``The indivisible German nation must also have its heart in the
right place _ that is Berlin,'' he recently told the Welt am
Sonntag newspaper.
   A recent poll indicated nearly three-fourths of all West Germans
favor installing the capital of a united Germany in Berlin. There
have been no similar polls for people in East Germany, whose
capital is already East Berlin.
   Despite the popular support for Berlin as capital, some
opposition politicians have said Bonn should retain the title _
partly because of Berlin's past as the center of Hitler's Third
Reich.
   ``For 12 years Berlin was the capital of the brutal Hitler
dictatorship,'' says Freimut Duve, federal lawmaker with the
opposition Social Democrats.
   No one has yet formally proposed making Berlin a united
Germany's capital.
   And with all the complications of unification, and Berlin
technically still under the control of four foreign powers _ the
United States, Britain and France _ making Berlin the capital could
take some time.
   Government officials say billions of dollars of construction and
remodeling work already begun in Bonn's government quarter will be
completed, but have left open whether plans for further projects
will ever get off the ground.
   Kohl has said he would like to see Berlin the capital again, but
hints that Bonn could keep some crucial federal government
responsibilities.
   ``I am for Berlin, but Bonn must keep important functions,'' he
was quoted as saying by the Bild newspaper last month.
   That kind of talk is worrying Bonn boosters.
   A group of Bonn merchants, self-employed workers and scholars
has already launched a ``Yes To Bonn'' lobbying campaign to keep
their city as a united Germany's capital.
   They have been saying that while Berlin is tainted by the Nazi
years, West Germany's 41 years of democracy have bloomed in Bonn.
   West German news media say Bonn could lose nearly half its
residents if the capital is moved to Berlin, and real estate prices
in Bonn have already begun to slip.
   Bonn city officials seem to be putting their hopes on hints by
Kohl and others that their city won't be completely forsaken.
   ``We are just at the beginning of the capital city question,''
says Mayor Hans J. Daniels.

<TEXT>
   The Rev. Angelo Panigati stood
directly under a crucifix when a bomb landed nearby, gutting the
Italian Embassy and sending the Roman Catholic priest scurrying for
cover.
   Following his two dogs through a broken pane of glass into his
chapel, Panigati took refuge with his pups in a corner. More bombs
came, shaking the embassy grounds.
   On his first Sunday since last week's bloody coup attempt, the
65-year-old ruddy-faced Italian prayed for the afghan people. He
appeared to give no thought to his own brush with death.
   ``I don't believe in miracles,'' said Panigati, who's been in
Afghanistan since he was 40. ``But I'm about to.''
   His congregation, a gathering of 12, laughed. On Sunday,
services were moved to Panigati's living room while the
bomb-damaged chapel underwent repairs.
   The Italian Embassy and surrounding buildings were just several
of scores of structures around kabul destroyed by bombs dropped by
renegade fighter pilots. At least 95 civilians were killed and 197
injured in the failed coup. No military casualties have been
released.
   No one was in the embassy at the time of the attack.
   Western missions left Afghanistan a little more than a year ago
as Soviet troops withdrew after a 10-year intervention, wrongly
expecting the swift collapse of President Najib's government at the
hands of Moslem guerrillas. Kabul now has just 21 functioning
foreign embassies.
   The coup appears to have put on hold plans by some Western
countries to return. Planned low-level diplomatic visits from
Italy, Austria, France and Britain have been postponed, diplomats
say.
   At the Italian compound, the bomb blew out windows in the
embassy, bending the reinforced steel on the windows like rubber.
Windows were knocked out in the chapel 300 feet away and in
Pangati's house next door.
   A crater 10 feet deep and 20 feet wide yawned opposite the
embassy.
   The father's beloved greenhouse was also gutted.
   ``I'll just have to start it all over again,'' he said as he
surveyed the damage, dressed in an Afghan sweater and an apron
decorated with blue ducks.
   It won't be the first time.
   Since the civil war began in the late 1970s, Panigati has
suffered rocket attacks and raining flares, which Soviet planes
drop to confuse heat-seeking missiles as they circle Kabul.
   Everything seems to hit the greenhouse.
   ``Flares are the fruit of Kabul'' he said with a chuckle.
``Instead of cherries or apples we get these.''
   The priest opened a drawer in his living room revealing a
collection of hundreds of spent flares.
   Panigati belongs to the Barnabites, a Catholic order founded in
1533. The Barnabites opened their mission in Afghanistan on Jan. 1,
1933 following an agreement between the Italian dictator Benito
Mussolini, the Vatican and the Afghan government.
   Fascist Italy was the second government after the Soviet Union
to recognize King Amanullah Khan, so the Afghan government welcomed
Italian priests.
   Panigati's mission has been limited to serving the foreign
community. No missionary work is allowed. But the priest, who
speaks 10 languages, has been allowed to teach.
   All of Kabul's secondary schools are closed now _ the war _ so
he has private students.
   Panigati said his close call with the bomb didn't frighten him.
   ``I've been through all of this before,'' he said.
   During World War II, a German soldier was shot in Panigati's
town and Germans decided to take revenge by killing some civilians.
Panigati was one of those chosen to die.
   ``They put me against the wall to shoot me but them bombings
began and I ran off.''
   Later, he was on his way to the Dachau concentration camp when
another bombing attack derailed the train. Panigati said he escaped
into a corn field.
   On Thursday, after the fighting ended, Panigati said he awoke to
a ``beautiful symphony.''
   ``It was a symphony of sweeping glass,'' he said. ``Everywhere
around me, I heard the sound and I thought, `Lord, how good it is
for us to be here.'''

<HEAD>New Spy-Catching Weapons Weighed In Closed-Door Intelligence
Review</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New weapons to catch spies _ including rewards
for reporting turncoat relatives and greater FBI access to tax
records _ are being studied by a panel of private citizens working
behind closed doors for the leaders of the Senate Intelligence
Committee.
   Many of the ideas under discussion revolve around money _ now
the most common motivation for those who deliver U.S. secrets to
foreign governments.
   Without any public announcement, nine men usually at the beck
and call of presidents were recruited last spring by Sens. David
Boren, D-Okla., and William Cohen, R-Maine, chairman and vice
chairman of the Intelligence Committee, for a unique effort to
respond to ``the decade of the spy.''
   Most of the nine are former White House, CIA, State or Justice
officials who, Cohen said, not only are trusted by the nation's
intelligence officers but also can rally political support if
controversial new laws seem needed.
   In an interview, Cohen said he and Boren want ``to enhance
security measures without turning into a Stalinist paranoid state.''
   During the 1980s, the United States caught and convicted more
spies than during the entire post-World War II era, but many
already had worked inside the U.S. government for decades
undetected.
   Members of the panel have visited the CIA, FBI, Justice and
Defense Departments, National Security Agency and other
intelligence agencies over the past nine months. Cohen said they're
looking for ``common elements of these cases'' and new defenses.
   That sort of work normally would be done by the president's
National Security Council staff, but President Bush's
administration has no counterespionage proposals on the table.
   The advisers are: former deputy CIA Director and National
Security Agency chief Bobby Ray Inman; former CIA Director Richard
Helms; former Carter White House counsel Lloyd Cutler; and former
Reagan White House counsel Arthur B. Culvahouse Jr.
   Also, former ambassador and senior State Department official
Seymour Weiss; former ambassador and Xerox executive Sol Linowitz;
former Deputy Attorney General and former Deputy Secretary of State
Warren Christopher; and Boren's friend Eli Jacobs, a venture
capitalist who owns the Baltimore Orioles baseball team and has
served on defense advisory panels.
   Columbia University law professor Harold Edgar is helping draft
legislative proposals, which Cohen expects in about two months.
   While refusing to discuss the panel's deliberations, Inman said
his personal observation is that in 90 percent of the spy cases
since 1975, ``Americans made the initial approach'' to spy for
foreign powers.
   ``Back in the 1930s and 1940s, almost every case of espionage
had one of two factors, either ideological sympathy or blackmail,''
Inman said.
   The ideological sympathy evaporated among spies even before the
wane of communism around the world during the last year. And ``it's
pretty hard to blackmail people for lifestyle these days,'' Inman
said. But ``look at the number of people who have taken money.''
   Cohen agreed. ``One of the weaknesses has been that we have not
had laws on updating financial status,'' he said. ``If a guy goes
from a Vega to a Jaguar in a year's time, something's wrong.''
   For example, Navy spies John Walker and Jerry Whitworth, who
enabled the Soviets to read a million coded messages, were paid
hundreds of thousands of dollars. Ronald Pelton sold NSA secrets
after he nearly went broke.
   An administration source said one idea floated to the panel is a
long-sought FBI goal _ easier access to tax records and consumer
credit data. When hunting a foreign agent, FBI agents can get bank
records in secret without having enough evidence for a criminal
search warrant, but they need such a warrant to obtain tax and
credit data.
   Inman suggested that a computer list of officials with access to
top secrets could be used by the IRS to ``tell you if there was any
significant change, either a bankruptcy or a large gain.''
   Inman also said stiffer penalties could be imposed on officials
who falsify financial disclosure reports.
   Noting that John Walker's wife, Barbara, concealed his spying
for 16 years before turning him in, Inman asked, ``Do you set up an
awards system? We do with whistle blowers.''
   The espionage review was planned before State Department
official Felix Bloch came under suspicion last year. But, as one
intelligence community source said, ``like everything else, it's
been driven by some front-burner events'' including the Bloch
affair, in which investigators have almost given up hope of filing
criminal charges.
   Inman said one of the biggest difficulties in espionage cases is
proving intent to harm the United States. He suggested spies might
be charged with crimes other than espionage, such as theft of
government property. Meeting a foreign agent without reporting it,
as Bloch allegedly did, also could be made a crime, he said.
   But one executive branch source, dubious about the outside
advisers' usefulness, said courts accept the delivery of even one
piece of classified information to a foreign power as proof of
intent to harm, because the government warns employees who see
secrets about the danger of exposing them.
   ``They're focusing on several problems that have been solved
since they left the government,'' this source said. ``Our big
counterintelligence problem is not new legislation, but new values
in society so people won't be so willing to sell out their
country.''
   But an intelligence community source said the need to identify a
specific secret passed _ the missing element in the Bloch
investigation _ ``means you literally have to catch them
red-handed.''
   ``This problem doesn't come up very often,'' the intelligence
official said. ``When it does, it presents a big hurdle.''

<HEAD>High Tides Solve Traffic Problems In Lagoon City</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VENICE, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   High tides over the weekend filled the
Venetian canals, lifelines of this lagoon city, which had sunk to
dangerously low levels last week.
   The rising waters also helped the arrival of guests for Sunday's
launching of the Moro di Venezia, the yacht belonging to Italian
tycoon Raul Gardini, which will be Italy's challenger in the 1992
America's Cup.
   ``Traffic is back to normal through all canals, but the problem
of accumulated mud is something which must be solved soon,'' said
an official of the city waterworks, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Traffic on scores of small canals had come to a halt last week
due to accumulated mud and prolonged low tides.
   The Grand Canal and other major waterways remained open to
gondolas and motorboats.
   ``Certainly last week's low tide was very unusual in this period
of the year and was probably due to a long dry spell,'' said
Antonio Manfrin, a Venetian motorboat driver.
   ``Water was about 60 centimeters (24 inches) below the normal
levels. It's ironic in a city where we always had problems from
flood tides,'' he added.
   The canals have not been dredged in 40 years. The mud and low
tides combined to cause a number of problems _ including the
transportation of sick people to hospitals.
   City officials claimed on Saturday that cleaning of canals has
been delayed by red tape and by the inability of regional
authorities to find a place to store the mud.

   Timothy Busfield says he draws on his own
personality in playing Elliott Weston, the yuppie jerk, in ABC's
``thirtysomething.''
   ``That's who I am,'' Busfield said in an interview in the March
17 edition of TV Guide.
   ``I'm a jerk, first and foremost. I don't know the answers. I'm
an idiot. I make mistakes. I stick my foot in my mouth. I'm
insensitive when I don't want to be.''
   But Busfield said he has more than an emotional identification
to Elliot.
   Elliot has a failed business behind him and two small children
he struggles to know. He chases other women and at one point
separated from his wife.
   When the role was offered to him, Busfield was in the throes of
his own failed marriage, had trouble connecting with his own young
son and had watched his children's theater project go under.
   This season, Elliot has reconciled with his wife, is back
working with his old partner and has reached an understanding with
his children. And Busfield has remarried, has a second son and his
children's theater company is thriving.
   He said he people he meets recognize him as Elliot. He gets
Bibles in the mail from those offended by the character's
philandering, and one time a woman walked up to him in a
supermarket, said ``Oh, it's you!'' and slapped him.
   People are ``emotionally disturbed by Elliot, yet they're
completely enthralled by the character,'' Busfield said. ``He gets
under their skin.''

   Rob Lowe says he's worried about how moviegoers
will react to his first appearance on the big screen since a
videotape of his sexual escapades was splashed across TV screens.
   ``There's no way that you can know how embarrassing it was,''
Lowe says in the March 19 issue of People. ``No matter what
adjective I choose, it would be trivializing it.''
   Lowe says he went underground to escape the publicity
surrounding an X-rated videotape of himself and two other women _
one of whom was a minor _ made in an Atlanta hotel room in 1988.
   He doesn't dispute that he videotaped his guests and says they
knew they were being recorded. He denies, however, having sex with
the 16-year-old. A lawsuit is pending in that case.
   The district attorney in Atlanta chose not to prosecute Lowe. In
exchange, Lowe agreed to do 20 hours of community service.
   With the release of his new movie, ``Bad Influence,'' Lowe says
he is hoping the public will forgive and forget.
   ``I'm real nervous,'' said Lowe, who turns 26 today.

   Christy Ficthner-Alhadef, Miss USA 1986,
says she was exploited during her yearlong reign, making her the
second former beauty queen to criticize the pageant operation.
   ``No one is pushed that hard, not Miss Universe, not the
chaperones, just Miss USA,'' she told The Wichita Eagle in a recent
interview.
   Miss USA 1989, Gretchen Polhemus, also complained about her
treatment when she wore the crown. Pageant management was changed
in 1988, but many of the complaints were similar, centering on long
hours and few days off.
   The day after the new Miss USA, Carole Gist, was crowned March 2
in a televised show from Wichita, Polhemus, 24, aired her gripes.
   ``She was the first one to be honest and say something negative
about the pageant,'' Fichtner-Alhadef, 27, said from her Dallas
home last week. ``You get trained and conditioned to say the right
thing. I don't care anymore.''
   Pageant officials said they tell the contestants the work is
hectic and thee are long hours, but improvements have been made to
make the reign more enjoyable.

   Miss America Debbye Turner met with
a group of troubled girls and discovered that ``our dreams and
expectations are not all that different.''
   ``What I found out was we had more in common than we thought we
did,'' said Ms. Turner, 24, crowned Miss America 1990 in September.
   Ms. Turner had one-on-one interviews Sunday with seven girls
ages 14 to 18 at the Females in Transition Center. The program, run
by the state Department of Corrections, helps girls from broken
homes or with criminal records get back into the mainstream.
   ``Every one of these girls recognizes that at some level they
made a mistake,'' said Ms. Turner. ``They are determined and
committed to making their life what they want it to be.''
   She said she made plans with each of the girls to write to one
another so they could chart each other's progress.

   Howard Rollins, co-star of NBC's ``In the
Heat of the Night,'' said his addictions to drugs and alcohol drove
him to consider suicide three days before Christmas.
   The actor, who portrays detective Virgil Tibbs, said an inner
voice was telling him: ``Just go ahead and kill me. I'm sick of it.
I'll never straighten out my life, I'll never have the career I
want.
   ``How can I talk about a career when I can't even stop using
drugs? Why can't I just take a gun to my head and be out of this
misery?''
   In an interview in the March 17 issue of TV Guide, Rollins said
he took his last drug on Dec. 28. Then he packed up his drug
paraphernalia and stomped it to pieces.
   ``I have a thing inside, a needing or craving, that I am
constantly dealing with,'' he said.
   Rollins said he was only an occasional user when he landed the
Tibbs role in 1987 but was addicted within six months.

<HEAD>Don't Fall On Your Sword Till You See Brad Waller</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto WX6</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brad Waller teaches Shakespearean sword
fighters how to take the ``ouch'' out of touche.
   A certified expert in stage combat, Waller can turn an amateur
swashbuckler into a Douglas Fairbanks or Errol Flynn in 15 weeks of
strenuous Monday night sessions at Washington's Folger Shakespeare
Theater.
   For a $350 fee, Waller trains actors in the art of dueling with
such deadly weapons as rapier and dagger, broadsword and
quarterstaff without committing mayhem on the stage _ but
convincing theatergoers they're seeing the real thing.
   His rapier's slashing attacks stop perilously close to a
student's arms, legs or abdomen. Before each parry and thrust, he
gives broad visual clues to make his next move as obvious as
possible. His bucklers, the shield between a sword's blade and
handle, are fashioned from hubcaps and silver-plated candy dishes.
   Waller's deft movements are patterned after the highly refined
techniques of Camillo Agrippa, Achille Marozzo and other 16th
century fencing masters, whose books he has studied in the archives
of the Folger Shakespeare Library.
   ``Those techniques can be very dangerous,'' Waller said. ``In a
way, they were meant to kill. So stage combat can never be
historically accurate, or you'd kill the actors. I try to teach
safety first, and the skills to make the actor really look good.''
   The ebullient, red-haired Waller, 34, a Wisconsin-born actor who
grew up in Minneapolis, learned his craft under Paddy Crean, dean
of the Society of American Fight Directors. It was Crean who taught
Errol Flynn how to handle his rapier with wit.
   ``Paddy always said that stage combat is 75 percent drama, 15
percent historical accuracy and 100 percent safety,'' said Waller,
one of only five students to receive the society's demanding
teaching certificate in 1988.
   Box-office stars who have been coached by society professionals
in ``fight choreography,'' which includes fisticuffs as well as
swordplay, include Christopher Walken, William Hurt, Jon Voigt,
Henry Winkler, Kathleen Turner and Amy Irving.
   When he's not working with actors, teaching in local schools or
performing onstage, Waller hits the road with ``Shakespeare
Lunatics and Lovers,'' an Elizabethan theatrical troupe that stages
battles and love scenes from the Bard of Avon's plays before high
school audiences.
   People no longer settle feuds in a fencing duel, but Waller says
there will be a big demand for classical actors trained in
swordplay as long as Shakespeare's plays are performed.
   Shakespeare's works are full of bloody sword fights and
suicides, in keeping with the Elizabethan tradition of pleasing
audiences not only with plays but competitive bouts of swordplay.
   Waller said some of Shakespeare's stage roles, including clowns
and fools, were written for fencing masters of the day.
   In ``Romeo and Juliet,'' the hotheaded Tybalt who ``tilts with
piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast'' took his name from
Girard Thibault, who wrote a manual in 1628 describing the quick,
precise cutting motions of the Spanish style of fencing.
   Before he was slain at Tybalt's hand, Mercutio called his
adversary ``the very butcher of a silk button.'' Waller said that
referred to an Italian fencing master in London, probably known to
Shakespeare, who ``could take the silk buttons off any Englishman''
with his rapier.
   The English language, in fact, is rich with words and phrases
that originated in fencing, Waller said.
   ``When you say you crossed someone or gave him the slip, you are
using old fencing terms for maneuvers designed to thwart an
opponent,'' he said. ``If you say, `Come to the point,' you are
really challenging someone to a duel.''

<HEAD>Census Workers Will Try to Count the Homeless</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BETH J. HARPAZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tompkins Square Park band shell is filled
each night with piles of ragged blankets. A passerby might hear
sneezes and snores and realize there are people underneath, but
certainly wouldn't know how many, or their sex, race or age.
   That is what census workers are being asked to find out _
without waking anyone up _ from 2 a.m. to 4 a.m. March 21 at parks
and other outdoor sites where the homeless congregate.
   The survey is part of an unprecedented nationwide count in
shelters, parks, subways, vacant buildings, doorways and
bank-machine vestibules. The plan's critics call it poorly designed
and doomed to undercount the homeless, estimated by the Coalition
for the Homeless to number 70,000 to 90,000 in New York City alone.
   The Census Bureau already has issued a disclaimer.
   ``We are deliberately staying away from defining this as a
census of the homeless,'' said Kenneth Meyer, assistant regional
census manager. ``Nor are we saying that we expect to get 100
percent count of the homeless. It's going to give us some idea of
the characteristics of this group but not necessarily the true size
of it.''
   Still, advocates for the homeless and city officials fear a low
count will be used to justify social service budget cuts.
   Some homeless advocates have refused to cooperate with the
Census Bureau plan; others believe they must participate to
legitimize any objections afterward.
   ``Hopefully this exercise, fraught with problems before it
starts, is not going to be used to justify yet another estimate
from the government that is tragically low on how many homeless
there are in the nation,'' said Peter Smith, president of the
Partnership for the Homeless. ``If it is, we will just have to say:
We told you so.''
   City officials and advocates for the homeless have a long list
of complaints about the count's timing, organization, the data to
be collected and the recruitment of people to do the counting.
   From 6 p.m. to about midnight March 20, census workers will
visit shelters and hotels used by the homeless.
   The 2 a.m.-to-4 a.m. outdoor count will be followed by a 4
a.m.-to-6:30 a.m. count of those leaving abandoned buildings. For
safety's sake, enumerators will not be sent inside. Critics want
the counters to stay later.
   ``Homeless people, like everyone else, sleep at night,'' said
Kristin Morse, assistant director at the Coalition for the Homeless.
   In shelters, enumerators will help homeless people fill out the
same forms everyone else gets in the mail. But enumerators counting
homeless people in places like streets and parks need only record
age, sex, race, marital status and whether the person is of
Hispanic origin. If the homeless person is sleeping, the counter
must guess.
   In places like Tompkins Square on Manhattan's Lower East Side,
where the homeless wrap themselves in piles of blankets, this will
be hard. Yet, said Meyer, ``We don't want them pulling a blanket
off someone and find they are staring at a knife or pistol.''
   Enumerators are forbidden to ask people whether they are
homeless, and may miss people as a result.
   ``Part of surviving on the street is being able to hide or being
able to look like they're not homeless,'' said Morse.
   Even if asked, many homeless people would not admit they have no
place to live, Meyer said.
   In New York, city officials, homeless advocates, transit police
and others compiled a list of 2,167 sites where homeless people
congregate. But for safety reasons, some of those places, such as
train tunnels, will not be surveyed.
   ``I understand why they're not doing it,'' said Morse. ``The
tunnels can be very dangerous. But they are going to miss a lot of
people.''
   Estimates of the number of homeless nationwide have ranged from
250,000 to 3 million in recent years. A decade ago census takers
went to shelters but did not try to count people living in alleys,
under bridges and in similar locations.
   The Census Bureau is trying to include the homeless and people
who work with them as counters. The $7- to $10-an-hour jobs have
been advertised in New York City in Street News, a non-profit
newspaper sold by the homeless, eliciting hundreds of inquiries
from homeless people.
   Critics say the application process poses many hurdles.
Applicants must fill out a four-page form, produce two pieces of
identification, provide a social security number, an address and
phone number, and are asked to have five years of job experience
and no criminal record.
   Meyer says the Census Bureau can overlook convictions for
trespassing or other non-violent offenses, will help the homeless
obtain Social Security numbers, and is flexible about an uneven
work history.
   The Census Bureau also is funding an assessment of the survey in
five cities by independent researchers. The assessment will be used
to refine any future count of ``elusive populations,'' said Kim
Hopper, the primary researcher in New York.

<HEAD>Two Agents Charged in Beating Death of Prisoner</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court has indicted two agents of Israel's
Shin Bet security service in the beating death of a Palestinian
prisoner in a jail in the occupied Gaza Strip, the Justice Ministry
announced.
   The names of the two defendants and details of the case were
banned from publication until an initial closed-door hearing is
held, Sunday's announcement said. It said the defendants' lawyers
had agreed to what could be published about the case.
   It is unusual for charges to be brought against Shin Bet agents,
and the closed-door treatment of the case was in keeping with
traditional secrecy about the agency responsible for Israel's
internal security.
   The name of the agency's chief, for example, is an official
secret.
   The charge of manslaughter was brought in the death of Khaled
Kamel Al Sheikh Ali, 27, who died Dec. 19 after being arrested on
suspicion of belonging to the Moslem fundamentalist Jihad Islami
organization and of illegal possession of weapons.
   After his death, Israeli newspapers quoted authorities as
attributing his death to a heart attack, but an independent autopsy
performed at the request of his family on Dec. 24 found he died of
internal bleeding.
   The Justice Ministry announcement said the two defendants
questioned the prisoner and ``during the interrogation...the
accused dealt blows to Sheikh Ali, and as a result Sheikh Ali
suffered internal bleeding that led to his death.''
   The indictment was handed down Thursday in Jerusalem District
Court but not made public until the ministry's announcement.
   The state prosecutor's office had requested that details be
withheld and the hearing be secret, the announcement said.
   According to an Israeli human rights group, there are nine other
cases in which Palestinians died in custody since the Palestinian
uprising against Israeli occupation began in December 1987. Those
cases involve either prison or Shin Bet personnel.
   The Israeli Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories
did not list prosecutions in any of the cases.
   Also during the uprising, four Israeli soldiers were tried in
the beating death of a Palestinian in the Gaza Strip in August
1988. They were acquitted of manslaughter but convicted of
brutality.
   In September, a Shin Bet agent was acquitted of negligence in
the death of a Palestinian who died in custody in July 1987, before
the uprising started. The agent's name was not made public.
   The most publicized case in the past involving Shin Bet agents
was the beating deaths of two Palestinian guerrillas while in
custody after the guerrillas took hostages aboard a hijacked
Israeli bus in April 1984.
   The Shin Bet chief Avraham Shalom resigned amid accusations that
evidence had been faked to frame an army officer.
   President Chaim Herzog pardoned four top Shin Bet officials
accused of either ordering the killings or withholding information
on them. Israel's Supreme Court upheld the pardons and rejected an
appeal for a full investigation.

   More than 1,000 displaced Nicaraguans cheered
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro after the Nicaraguan president-elect's
return to Houston to get a brace removed from her knee.
   Chanting `Viva Dona Violeta!'' and ``Viva Nicaragua!'' the
supporters joined Mrs. Chamorro in singing Nicaragua's national
anthem Sunday night.
   Mrs. Chamorro, who is using a wheelchair while recovering from
knee surgery, greeted several supporters with kisses and
handshakes. She addressed the crowd after a Mass at St. Thomas More
Catholic Church.
   She pledged anew to end the draft and grant amnesty to
countrymen in exile. But her words were drowned out by cheers.
   ``We want to show her our support,'' said Doraldina Arguello
Schiene. ``As American Nicaraguans, we want to show her we support
her in her victory and that we trust her to do the job. I feel very
confident that 99 percent of the Nicaraguans who were here today
were here to show her their support.''
   Mrs. Chamorro fell and broke her kneecap on New Year's Eve and
underwent surgery in Houston Jan. 4. She returned to Nicaragua on
Jan. 16 and campaigned on crutches as the opposition candidate
against Sandinista President Daniel Ortega.
   Mrs. Chamorro defeated Ortega in an upset in the Feb. 25
election. She takes office April 25.
   She returned to Houston on Thursday and orthopedic surgeon Dr.
Malcolm W. Granberry removed her brace Friday.
   Contra leader Adolfo Calero flew in from Miami to join the
supporters.
   ``All Nicaraguans are very happy and enthusiastic about Violeta
Chamorro's triumph,'' Calero said. ``All I hear is the people
saying, `We'll see you in Nicaragua. We'll see you in Nicaragua.' I
think a lot of people will be returning. I know I will.''
   Calero joined Mrs. Chamorro in calling for disbanding of both
Contra forces and the Sandinista military.
   Calero said all the Nicaraguans in exile will be watching the
country in the next month, hoping to see concrete signs that they
can return to their country in safety.
   ``They want to see that there is peace _ that's the most
important thing _ peace,'' he said.

   Get ready, America. Your ``no tax increase''
federal government is about to start collecting another new tax.
   As taxes go, this one isn't much. Most of the impact will be on
businesses, at least at first. It could raise the price of a
telephone by a dime but add $25 or so to the cost of recharging an
automobile air conditioner.
   On April 1, the government will begin collecting this new tax,
which is aimed at limiting use of chemicals _ chlorofluorocarbons,
or CFCs _ that are deemed to damage the ozone layer protecting the
Earth.
   It has the dual task of raising about $4.3 billion for deficit
reduction over the next five years.
   The CFC tax is only the latest move by Congress and the Reagan
and Bush administrations to reduce the budget deficit without
raising income-tax rates. President Reagan signed 13 tax increases
during his eight years in office; President Bush signed a package
of miscellaneous increases in December and proposed another round
this year.
   ``There is considerable feeling that the government will
continue to look this way in the future as long as such sources can
produce revenue,'' says Thomas P. Ochsenschlager of the Grant
Thornton accounting firm in Washington.
   If Bush gets his way this year, for example, the 8 percent
federal tax on airline tickets will rise to 10 percent; the 3
percent levy on telephone service, scheduled to expire Dec. 31,
will be made permanent; and about 3.8 million state and local
government workers who are not covered by a retirement plan will
have to start paying Social Security taxes.
   In the same message that proposed those tax increases, Bush
proclaimed his continued opposition to tax increases, just as
Reagan did for eight years and just as many members of Congress do,
even after voting for those higher taxes.
   The trick is that nobody is raising income-tax rates. Excise
taxes have been raised. Income-tax deductions have been reduced and
repealed. But the president and Congress have held fast against any
increase in income-tax rates.
   That leaves the government in constant pursuit of ``cats and
dogs,'' as detractors call the miscellaneous tax increases, to find
the revenue needed for deficit reduction.
   It all started in 1982, when Congress had second thoughts about
the huge 1981 tax cut that was the framework for Reagan's economic
policy and voted to boost taxes by $296 billion over five years.
   Nobody's rates were raised _ but the deduction for medical
expenses was diluted severely; the tax on cigarettes was doubled;
the telephone tax was tripled; and tax withholding was imposed on
interest and dividends. Because of public outcry, withholding was
repealed a year later.
   In 1984, Congress passed another thick tax law designed to
reduce the deficit by another $156 billion over five years. It
boosted the tax on a gallon of liquor by $2; reduced the benefit of
income averaging for those whose earnings fluctuate from year to
year; killed a tax credit for homeowners who buy solar energy
equipment and cut the value of several corporate tax deductions.
   Additional tax increases for deficit reduction were enacted in
1985 ($15.6 billion over five years), 1986 ($5.3 billion) and 1988
($66 billion).
   The 1989 version will bring in $22 billion over five years, with
one-quarter of the money coming from a Social Security tax increase
on workers earning more than $50,400 a year.
   The CFC tax is more typical of recent increases because it is a
hidden levy with little direct effect on voters. But consumers
usually end up paying at least some of the taxes that are levied on
business.
   Jack Terher Jr., a Ford dealer in Denver, said that to avoid the
CFC tax, he is spending up to $7,000 on equipment to recover freon,
a CFC used as a refrigerant, from auto air conditioners being
repaired. That probably will force an increase of about $25 in the
bill for recharging an air conditioner, Terher said.
   Other CFCs are widely used by electronics manufacturers to clean
computer chips and circuit boards. Because of competition, however,
sellers of refrigerators, computers, videocassette recorders and
televisions are unlikely to raise their prices the few cents
necessary to recoup the tax.
   ``I don't expect much impact on the consumer,'' says Steve
Mixtacki, vice president of American TV and Appliance in Madison,
Wis. ``But it is another big paperwork burden for business _
although the government apparently doesn't blink at that.''

   In the opinion of Gallup Poll executives,
the grandfather of public surveys has changed to keep up with the
times.
   Many top executives are gone. Interviewing operations have moved
from Princeton headquarters to Lincoln, Neb. Staffs have been
assembled in Moscow and Budapest, and the new owners have plans to
make the now-weekly poll daily.
   But some former employees have a different view. They say that
what the company describes as an overdue overhaul is a sacrifice of
quality for profits.
   Since its purchase 18 months ago by Nebraska-based Selection
Research Inc., the Gallup Organization has begun moving away from
public opinion polls to concentrate on more lucrative market
research, former executive Neil Upmeyer said.
   ``I believe it is their view that, because market research is
more profitable, more efficient, if they de-emphasize social
reseach and give additional attention to market research they would
have a better bottom line,'' he said.
   Upmeyer, a vice president of public affairs research before his
departure, now works for the Center for Analysis of Public Issues
in Princeton.
   He said the new Gallup owners are trying to use the poll's good
name to open more doors for private research on less engaging
topics like toothpaste preferences.
   Pursuit of bigger profits, he said, ``is a perfectly legitimate
thing for them to do. But from my point of view ... it negates the
purpose for having built this institution for the last 50 years. It
has the potential for irreparably damaging the Gallup name.''
   Also departing with unflattering words for the new owners were
Andrew Kohut, president of the Gallup Organization before the SRI
acquisition, and Diane Colasanto, former vice president for opinion
research.
   Jim Clifton, a former SRI executive who became chief executive
officer of the Gallup Organization after the acquisition, dismissed
it all as ``bitterness talking.''
   He said Upmeyer had his position ``upgraded'' _ a euphemism for
being fired. The old Gallup organization, he added, was badly in
need of a management overhaul to ensure the profitability necessary
to continue the costly stock-in-trade public opinion surveys.
   Like the housecleaning in executive positions, he said the move
of the telephone interviewing staff to Nebraska was aimed at
getting better people on board. A regional labor shortage, he said,
doomed the Princeton-based interviewing headquarters to a poorly
qualified staff with rapid turnover.
   The now-weekly public opinion polls will soon go daily, Clifton
said. The quick assembly of polling teams in Moscow last year and
Budapest in January, he added, are hardly signs of a diminished
commitment.
   Also in the works is a 60-nation poll on attitudes about the
environment, which Clifton bills as the largest public opinion
survey ever done.
   ``Absolutely more time and quality are going into it. A
corporation that has been there 50 years needs change. We're
upgrading technology. We're upgrading management,'' Clifton said.
   ``The Gallup Poll is a national treasure.... (But) the reality
is to have an outstanding public service company in the public
opinion business you have to make a lot of profit somewhere else.
   ``Upgrading people doesn't really constitute change to me.
There's an enormous Dr. George Gallup spirit about the place.''
   Clifton gets a second from George Gallup Jr., the son of the man
who founded the polling organization in 1936. The younger Gallup, a
co-chairman of the company, said his father would have approved of
the new owners' moves. The senior Gallup died in 1984.
   Whatever grand scheme might be behind them, the changes so far
have not hurt the quality of the Gallup Poll, said Michael Kagay,
surveys editor of The New York Times. The Times is one of about 100
newspapers that subscribe to the polls via The Los Angeles Times
news syndicate.
   Gallup, with a rich library of public opinions accumulated in a
half-century in the business, has a unique ability to measure
long-term trends and provide contexts for current findings, Kagay
said.
   ``It would be a great loss if anything happened to Gallup that
would hurt its ability to provide those,'' he said. ``I certainly
hope it doesn't happen.''
   Upmeyer, on the other hand, thinks the abundance of polls now
done by news organizations and other groups diminishes any void a
Gallup withdrawal would leave. The harm, he says, is to the Gallup
name.
   ``The work is going to continue to be done,'' he said. ``It's
just that it won't be done by Gallup.''

<HEAD>Special Interests Seen Favoring Status Quo on Farm Policy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When she introduced Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter at a conference last week, analyst Susan Sechler
said a lot of the current farm bill debate is being generated by
special interests who want to keep the pie sliced pretty much as it
is.
   ``Within the farm policy fraternity, it seems, the prevailing
mood is defensive,'' Sechler said. ``In the aftermath of the (farm
financial) disaster of the mid-1980s, and in the midst of a
fragile, uneven recovery, the farm policy club is preoccupied with
three things.''
   She said these are:
   _A desire to keep government deeply involved in agriculture,
including large annual costs of operating commodity programs.
   _Tinkering with programs in the name of ``flexibility'' so that
a few million acres can shift from one crop to another.
   _Efforts to ``deny a seat at the farm poker table to prospective
new players, notably consumer and environmental interests.''
   Sechler is director of rural economic policy for the Aspen
Institute, a private research organization based here. During the
Carter administration, she was a senior policy analyst at the
Agriculture Department.
   Congress has been holding hearings on a 1990 farm bill to
replace the Food Security Act of 1985. Just about everyone,
including the Bush administration, says the current law should be
the basis of the 1990 bill and that changes should be made with
tender loving care.
   A mainstay of the administration's proposals is flexibility to
allow farmers more freedom to plant what they choose, rather than
be forced into planting the same ``program'' crop year after year
to protect their federal benefits.
   ``This term (flexibility) is consistent with the rich tradition
of agricultural policy doublespeak, a tradition which in 1985
spawned a market-oriented farm bill that since has cost taxpayers
$90 billion,'' Sechler said.
   Yeutter told his audience at the food policy conference,
sponsored by Public Voice for Food and Health Policy, that
consumers need to understand what is at stake in the flexibility
issue on Capitol Hill.
   ``You ought to care, because it's going to have an impact on the
cost of food, the efficiency with which we run our food production
system in the United States,'' he said.
   Flexibility in crop plantings and rotation also would have some
effect on the level of agricultural ``inputs'' such as fertilizer
and pesticide used to grow food, Yeutter said. Rigid rules built
into current programs ``often demand that farmers use'' chemicals
to get maximum production.
   Yeutter also defended the administration's environmental
proposals for conservation, surface and ground water quality, and
the protection of wetlands.
   Some environmentalists say the administration should go even
further than what it has proposed for the 1990 farm bill, ``but the
fact is we've gone a lot farther than anybody's ever gone before in
any administration,'' he said.

   Land under irrigation may increase to record
levels in the 1990s if the government continues to throttle back on
acreage reduction programs, according to an Agriculture Department
analysis.
   The department's Economic Research Service said its study shows
a linkage between acreage reduction program (ARP) levels and the
area under irrigation.
   From 1949 to 1978, the area irrigated in the United States
doubled, reaching 50.3 million acres. But the agricultural census
of 1982 showed a decline of 1.3 million acres, and the 1987 census
showed a further drop of 2.6 million.
   Agency researchers said irrigation area dropped as the ARPs were
increased. This represents land farmers must take from production
in order to qualify for price support benefits.
   ``Since 1987, a substantial reduction in commodity stocks has
allowed USDA to ease (ARP) requirements,'' the agency said in the
March issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine. ``In 1989, area
diverted under annual programs was about half of the 1987 acreage
reductions.''
   Preliminary estimates indicate that more farmland was irrigated
in 1989 than in any year since 1981.
   ``Beyond 1990, irrigation could rise 3-4 million acres above
current levels if the area idled under the annual programs is
brought back into production,'' the report said.

   Imports of agricultural products rose to a
record $21.5 billion last year, with most of the items competitive
with domestic products, according to the Agriculture Department.
   Total value of competitive items imported in the fiscal year
that ended last Sept. 30 was more than $15.24 billion, lead by
$3.84 billion worth of fruits, nuts and vegetables. Beef and pork
imports were next at $2.3 billion.
   Non-competitive imports were valued at $6.27 billion, including
$2.47 billion worth of coffee and $1.05 billion worth of rubber and
gums, said the department's Foreign Agricultural Service.

<TEXT>
   The Arab League has decided to move its
headquarters back to Cairo from the Tunisian capital, where it was
transferred in 1979 after Egypt broke ranks with Arab countries by
making peace with Israel.
   In a dispatch from Tunis, Egypt's state-run Middle East News
Agency said Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid of Egypt announced
the decision Sunday at a regular biannual session of the 22-member
league.
   He said the move would come in September.
   ``This decision is based on the (Arab League) charter, and Egypt
has been cautious to coordinate views with Tunisia because of the
strong ties between the Tunisian and Egyptian leaderships,''
Abdel-Meguid said.
   He thanked Kuwait, Oman, Iraq and Morocco, as well as Arab
League Secretary General Chedli Klibi, for their ``effort and
cooperation,'' in bringing about the decision.
   The agency said the offices of the Arab Organization for
Education, Culture and Science, and the Arab Broadcasting Union
would remain in Tunis.
   Sunday's move followed Egyptian diplomatic efforts to return the
headquarters of the Arab League to Cairo, where it was set up in
1945.
   The league decided 11 years ago to transfer the headquarters to
Tunis as a sanction against Egypt for signing a peace treaty with
Israel in 1979.
   All Arab states except Oman, Sudan and Somalia severed ties with
Cairo in retaliation for its peace treaty with Israel.
   Egypt returned to the Arab fold after a league summit in 1987
allowed its members to resume ties with Cairo. All but Libya have
officially restored diplomatic links with Cairo, whose suspension
from the Arab League was lifted in May at a summit meeting in
Casablanca, Morocco.
   Egypt insisted on returning the leagues offices to Cairo in
accordance with the league charter, which stipulates that the
Egyptian capital should be the seat of the organization.

<TEXT>
   Martial Singher, a French baritone
whose operatic career was cut short by a heart disorder, has died
at 85.
   Singher, who had undergone heart surgery twice, died at his home
on Friday.
   From his Metropolitan Opera debut in ``The Tales of Hoffman,''
in 1943, Singher was hailed by critics for his elegant and precise
style. A heart disorder ended his career at the Met in 1959 after
performances in 200 operas there.
   He continued a brief concert career in recital and orchestral
appearances with major philharmonics across the nation, including
Boston and Los Angeles.
   Singher turned to teaching at the Curtis Institute in
Philadelphia and elsewhere before settling in Santa Barbara in 1962
to head the vocal department at the Music Academy of the West. He
retired in 1981.
   Students of Singher's include a score of leading members of the
Metropolitan, New York City, Berlin, Hamburg, Salzburg, Vienna,
Munich, Bonn, Frankfurt and Paris operas.
   Born in the southwest of France, Singher joined the Paris Opera
in 1930, where he performed for 10 years. Singher headed to the
United States after Paris fell to the Nazis.
   He is survived by his wife, Eta; three sons, and two
grandchildren.
   No funeral services will be held.

<TEXT>
   As April 15 approaches, Irwin Schiff
cringes at the thought of millions of obedient Americans sweating
over their 1040s so they can turn over their hard-earned dollars to
Uncle Sam.
   ``It's a sad commentary on the intelligence and the awareness of
the American public,'' Schiff said _ in a telephone interview from
the Morgantown, W.Va., federal prison where he is serving a second
term for tax offenses.
   ``The government changed April Fool's Day from April 1 to April
15 _ they fooled the public into believing that they are required
to pay income taxes.''
   Nobody can say Schiff, author of the 1982 best seller ``How
Anyone Can Stop Paying Income Taxes,'' doesn't have the courage of
his convictions.
   Schiff landed back in prison in August when the IRS found out
that a year after his parole for a 1985 conviction, he still hadn't
paid back taxes and penalties for 1980, 1981 and 1982.
   Over the years, the tax protester has sacrificed nearly
everything he owns in his crusade against the Internal Revenue
Service, including an estimated $133,000 in book royalties seized
to pay back taxes. He's lost his insurance and investment
businesses.
   All this because the 62-year-old former Hamden resident
stubbornly refuses to yield an inch in his position that personal
income taxes are strictly voluntary and the government can't force
anybody to pay.
   For nearly two decades, Schiff has been preaching to anybody
who'll listen to his interpretation of the 16th Amendment, which
gave the U.S. government authority to tax income from any source _
or so the IRS says.
   Schiff maintains that the amendment, adopted in 1913, gave the
government power to tax goods and privileges but not wages. The
amendment, by the way, was never ratified by Connecticut.
   He stopped paying income taxes _ at least voluntarily _ in 1974.
   The IRS finally got Schiff in 1980; he was sentenced to six
months in prison and fined $10,000. He was arrested again in 1985,
serving six months before being paroled.
   Since landing back in prison, Schiff, who is representing
himself in this legal morass, has come up with yet another scheme
to frustrate the IRS: Go ahead and fill out the IRS forms, but
don't declare any taxable income _ zero.
   Schiff's family wishes he would relent in his battle against the
IRS, but they doubt he will.
   ``A lot of people think he is an idiot but he is not,'' said his
son, Andrew, who, unlike his father, pays his taxes. ``Like many
people who are obsessed with a cause, he is only very stubborn.''

<HEAD>Case Suggests Drug Taken By Women May Harm Their Granddaughters</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The parents and doctor of a 13-year-old girl
who died of vaginal cancer say they suspect other children could be
at risk of cancer caused by a drug their grandmothers took decades
earlier.
   Sarah Roberts of suburban Olney, Md., whose daughter Amy died
last year, said a lawyer representing the family was filing suit
today against Eli Lilly and Co. of Indianapolis, which manufactured
the synthetic hormone diethylstilbestrol, or DES.
   A Lilly spokesman did not return a telephone call seeking
comment.
   The Food and Drug Administration banned the drug from use by
pregnant women in the early 1970s after it had been used by an
estimated 3 million women over three decades in the belief that it
would prevent miscarriages.
   DES was made and sold by some 300 pharmaceutical companies from
1947 to 1971. In 1970, researchers discovered the link between DES
and cancer in daughters of women who used the drug.
   Don McLearn, an FDA spokesman, said Amy Roberts' case was the
first he had heard of a genetic defect that may be related to DES
possibly being passed to a grandchild. In Amy's case, the gene
would have come through her father.
   Mrs. Roberts said her mother-in-law, who is still living and has
one other young granddaughter, took the drug in 1949 when she was
pregnant with Amy's father, the Rev. J. David Roberts, a Methodist
minister in Olney.
   She said two of her husband's sisters have had medical problems
which they blame on the drug their mother took. Two grandchildren
died after being born prematurely, she said.
   The FDA says the drug is still manufactured for some medical
applications but is banned from use during pregnancy.
   ``Amy had no symptoms until she came home from school on a
Thursday complaining of a pain in the back of her neck,'' Mrs.
Roberts said in a telephone interview. A week later, she said,
doctors had discovered cancer in Amy's vagina and lungs and told
the Roberts their daughter had only three months to live.
   Amy died last June, after doctors fought for 14 months to
control the rare cancer, which spread through her body, Mrs.
Roberts said.
   ``We are hoping to alert other DES sons and daughters that there
is a possibility of cancer and that maybe their daughters should be
checked,'' said Mrs. Roberts. She said doctors told her Amy might
have lived after surgery if the cancer had been detected earlier.
   A first sign of a problem may have come when Amy began
menstruating at age 9, Mrs. Roberts said, but a pediatrician told
her nothing was wrong.
   Dr. Herbert Kotz of Olney, who talked about the case only after
it was reported by The Washington Post on Sunday, said he and three
other doctors were preparing an article on it for submission to a
medical journal.
   Kotz said the article will explore the possibility that the
effects of DES may be passed beyond one generation.
   It also will note, he said, that the same cancer has been found
in several young women who had no exposure to DES in their family
histories and Amy's case could have occurred by chance.
   Kotz said the cancer usually is found among older women and has
almost never been linked to DES in a woman who showed the first
symptoms after age 30.
   A coauthor of the planned paper, Dr. Bruce Walker, has predicted
from animal studies that DES effects can pass through more than one
generation, Kotz said.
   He said the purpose of the paper is ``to alert the medical
profession to the fact that we may have another generation'' at
risk from the drug.
   The U.S. Supreme Court in October refused to hear appeals from
Lilly, E.R. Squibb &amp; Sons and Rexall Drug Co. fighting lawsuits
over the effects of DES. A New York ruling had forced all
manufacturers of the drug to share in paying damages for alleged
DES injuries.
   In March 1987, a U.S. District Court jury in Milwaukee ruled
Lilly was not negligent in marketing DES for use by pregnant women.
The court rejected a claim by Julie Shirkey, 25, of West Bend,
Wis., who said her mother's use of DES had left her with vaginal
cancer which led to a radical hysterectomy and the inability to
bear children.

   The dollar continued to rise against the Japanese
yen Monday, sending prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange down
sharply, dealers said.
   The dollar closed at 152.00 yen, up 0.85 yen from Friday's close
of 151.15 yen. It started trading at 151.68 yen and ranged between
151.60 and 152.18 yen during the day.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which rose
302.23 points on Friday, fell 624.89 points, or 1.84 percent,
closing at 33,368.23.
   Currency dealers said the dollar opened higher in Tokyo after it
was pushed up in the Sydney market. It was also bolstered by a
strong showing in New York Friday following the announcement of a
better-than-expected U.S. employment figure for February, said Toru
Kanai, a foreign exchange analyst with New Japan Securities Co.
   Traders said the Bank of Japan, the central bank, sold dollars
at around 151.85 yen in morning trading in its effort to stem the
yen's fall. Japan's central bank normally does not comment on its
interventionary activities.
   The employment statistics showed that the United States had
found jobs for 372,000 more non-agricultural workers in February,
compared with about 250,000 expected prior to the release.
   ``Although demand for the dollar remains strong, the currency is
not soaring quickly because many participants are becoming
concerned about the excessive rise in the dollar,'' Kanai said.
   On the stock market, securities dealers said the yen's
continuing weakness and persistent speculation about a possible
discount rate hike caused the index's fall.
   ``The whole market is weak across the board today mainly because
people do not want to engage in trading,'' said a dealer at Nikko
Securities Co., speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Market players have been speculating the Bank of Japan would
raise its official lending rate, which now stands at 4.25 percent,
by as much as 1 percent after central bank Governor Yasushi Mieno
returns Thursday from a visit to Europe.
   The market's anxiety over the rate increase sidelined investors,
the dealer said.
   ``I'd rather see the market get over an interest rate hike soon
and get back in action again,'' he said.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Events Abroad Complicating Pentagon Budget
Debate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Les Aspin, the chairman of the House Armed
Services Committee, says his plan for next year's Pentagon budget
is in the back of his ``beady-eyed mind'' and he's not talking.
   The Wisconsin Democrat says he plans to ``hide in the weeds''
while others are wrestling with the issue of U.S. defense spending
in a world where the perceived threats to the nation are changing
with breathtaking speed.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the Senate Armed Services Committee
chairman, is also keeping quiet. Needs more information, he says.
   Aspin and Nunn, as much as probably anyone in the United States,
understand the changing political landscape in Eastern Europe and
elsewhere. What they need more time to survey the effect those
changes have had on the American public and on the playing field of
Capitol Hill.
   The 1980s were a decade in which defense spending accelerated
rapidly and then leveled off near $300 billion a year. The yearly
budget battle took on a comfortable script: the Republican
administration would propose a big increase, the Democrats would
pare it down and a compromise would be struck.
   That pattern has now been shattered by the developments in the
Soviet sphere.
   ``It's a confusing situation ... It changes the way the game is
played,'' said Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the House
Budget Committee.
   The White House proposed a small increase in Pentagon spending
for fiscal 1991, less than what it would take to keep pace with
inflation but enough to protect cherished programs such as the B-2
stealth bomber and the Strategic Defense Initiative. It's a
comfortable position for congressional Republicans, of whom Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney was one until last year.
   But Democratic policymakers are facing demands in their party
for a ``peace dividend'' of Pentagon cutbacks to spend on domestic
priorities. They now have to decide how deeply to cut from Cheney's
$303 billion request, and where the cuts will be made.
   Panetta says the toughest decisions will be on terminating
weapons programs, especially those such as the B-2 bomber where
significant investments have been made and where budget savings are
slow to be realized.
   ``What you're talking about is reversing the process which took
place in the last eight years,'' where the military could launch
into expensive, multi-year projects and assume the budget would
grow to pay for them, he said.
   Reducing troop strength may also yield savings in the long term
rather than soon, because of the cost of bring the soldiers home
and close the bases.
   Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn., has
loosely embraced a plan to trim spending to $291 billion, $5
billion below the current year's level. The cuts over the next five
years, however, would total more than 10 times that amount.
   Democratic leaders say their struggle is for a defense spending
figure that represents a sound policy. But since sound policy is in
the eye of the beholder, election-year politics will undoubtedly be
a big part of the bill that passes.
   ``The worst thing that can happen is to simply pull a number out
of the air which no one can vote for,'' said Panetta.
   Liberal or conservative, lawmakers are touchy about any cuts
that might reverberate back home _ especially in an election year.
And since the majority Democrats have brought to their districts
more bacon, Republicans are trying to make it an issue.
   ``Whether it's an air base, or a naval base, or the manpower
around it, or the defense industry, or the subcontractors,''
members of Congress are ``hooked'' on military spending in their
districts, said House Republican leader Robert Michel of Illinois.
   Because of that, the Democrats have ``got serious problems'' in
drafting a defense bill, he said.
   They'll have to show they understand that ``the underlying
reason for having a Department of Defense and security forces are
to protect the security of the country and not be a jobs program or
a welfare program,'' Michel said.
   Defense contractors sensitive to home-district politics have
played the system carefully. Projects like the B-2 have
subcontractors spread all over the country.
   ``We're going to have to find a number that meets a lot of
political questions,'' said Rep. Marvin Leath of Texas, a
conservative Democrat on the Armed Services Committee.
   It ``ain't going to be an easy chore,'' he said.
   And it's not going to be quick. House Democratic leaders are
still fighting with the Pentagon over its proposed changes in the
current year's budget.
   It might take less time to unify Germany than to get Congress
and the administration to agree on a defense bill this year.

   The case in federal bankruptcy court was strictly
small potatoes, but it meant a lot to mechanic Norman Darish _ he
won it all himself.
   After months of stolen hours at the library, lunch breaks spent
cramming on legalese,and late-night rehearsals in front of a
mirror, Darish represented himself in a case concerning several
hundred dollars in unpaid bills at his family's garage.
   And he won.
   Even the attorneys were impressed.
   ``Check this out,'' one lawyer told another after the case was
closed. ``This kid represented himself and he did all right. He did
real good!''
   Darish made his 10-minute argument with all the panache of Perry
Mason. His suit, however, was not pinstripes but workboots and a
navy blue uniform with ``Leo's Auto Repair'' embroidered over the
breast pocket.
   Darish hadn't even removed the Phillips screwdriver, air
pressure gauge and magnetic pickup tool from his hip pocket before
hopping on the subway to make his lunchtime appearance.
   ``I didn't want to be pompous or a showboat,'' he recalled,
still flying high a week after winning his case early this month.
``I just wanted to look like myself _ an average person.''
   The defendant, a Boston socialite, claimed protection from
creditors under a federal bankruptcy filing. But Darish found out
he had been under federal bankruptcy protection almost perpetually
between 1982 and 1990.
   ``And meanwhile the little guys he owed money to were stuck,''
said Darsish, who appealed to the federal bankruptcy judge. The
judge agreed to dismiss the Chapter 13 filing.

   When actors at the Guthrie Theater share the
tools of their trade with lawyers, they start off with a
paradoxical lesson:
   ``The idea is not to get them to act,'' said actress Brenda
Wehle. ``The idea to get them to stop acting and be themselves.''
   Since communication is a large part of the trial lawyer's job,
the trial lawyers attending the class taught by Wehle and actor
Richard Guthrie are urged to strip away the extraneous gestures
that make the jury focus on them.
   ``The communication can never be how clever the attorney is,''
said Wehle. ``The communication has to be the predicament the
client was in.''
   The lessons are sometimes drawn through skits.
   In one, Grusin plays a lawyer who is making a brilliant closing
argument when opposing counsel _ Wehle _ begins rattling papers
behind him; in the parlance of the theater, he is being upstaged.
   Grusin does the only thing he can do to bring the jury's focus
back on him. He walks back to Wehle's table and stands alongside
her.
   ``She'll start seeing that I've caught her and everybody else
sees it, too,'' he said. ``So what started out being a cute little
ploy becomes a weapon for me.''
   Grusin has taught communications skills to thousands of lawyers
at the request of law schools, bar associations and law firms. He
also has been hired by lawyers to sit in on trials and critique
their performance.
   Not all reviews have been favorable. The late Leon Jaworski, the
famed Watergate special prosecutor, wrote a scathing critique after
attending one of Grusin's sessions. He felt the law was being
obscured by technique.
   But Grusin, after some thought, concluded that he was not
obscuring the law but clarifying it.
   ``Trying to be someone else is a lie that blocks effective
communication,'' he said.

   Here are the nine private citizens identified
by Senate and administration sources as conducting a
counterintelligence policy review for Sens. David Boren and William
Cohen, chairman and vice chairman, respectively, of the Senate
Intelligence Committee:
   Warren Christopher _ Los Angeles lawyer with O'Melveny &amp; Myers;
has been in and out of government for 30 years, serving as a trade
negotiator, deputy attorney general in the Johnson administration
and deputy secretary of State in the Carter administration. He
negotiated the 1981 release of U.S. Embassy hostages from Iran.
   Arthur B. Culvahouse Jr. _ Washington lawyer with O'Melveny &amp;
Myers; chief legislative assistant to then-Sen. Howard Baker,
R-Tenn.; White House counsel late in Reagan administration.
   Lloyd N. Cutler _ Washington lawyer with Wilmer, Cutler &amp;
Pickering; White House counsel in the Carter administration; chair
of Quadrennial Commission on federal salaries; member of
President's Commission on Ethics during Bush administration.
   Harold Edgar _ Columbia University law professor, serving as
legislative drafter for Boren-Cohen group. Coauthor of leading
article on application of espionage laws to publication of
government secrets.
   Richard Helms _ international consultant in Washington. Career
CIA officer who rose to CIA director in the Johnson and Nixon
administrations. Former ambassador to Iran.
   Bobby Ray Inman _ retired admiral; former director of naval
intelligence; vice director of Defense Intelligence Agency;
director of National Security Agency during Carter administration.
Alerted Justice Department to Billy Carter's dealings with Libya.
Deputy CIA director early in Reagan administration.
   The assignment comes at an opportune time for Inman. In
December, he relinquished the top job at a Texas defense industry
holding company, publicly pronouncing his seven years in the
private sector less satisfying than his long government service.
   A master at manipulating the bureaucracy, Inman suddenly was
more visible in Washington _ confirming a story about Gen. Manuel
Noriega's spying on U.S. operations in Panama as early as the
mid-1970s, then discussing counterintelligence ideas before an
American Bar Association committee.
   At the same time, his assignment from Boren and Cohen has
privately renewed his contacts throughout the intelligence
community and given him an opportunity to advertise his
availability for another assignment.
   Eli Jacobs _ New York-based venture capitalist. Owner of
Baltimore Orioles baseball team.
   Boren's friend, Jacobs is the least likely member of the panel.
He is not a member of the revolving-door society between government
and the private sector in Washington. His connection to
intelligence is a mystery.
   An Orioles spokesman says Jacobs' Army service included a tour
at Fort Holabird, Md., once a chemical warfare center. An
intelligence community source says, ``I've heard third-hand he
might have been in counterintelligence in the Army.''
   A spokesman for the Senate committee says, ``He's on an advisory
board to the secretary of defense, the defense policy or Defense
Science Board.'' Asked for confirmation, a secretary in his New
York office says, ``I wouldn't know. I've only been here since
January.''
   Sol Linowitz _ lawyer and diplomat in Washington. One-time head
of Xerox Corp. Named ambassador to the Organization of American
States during the Johnson administration; co-negotiator of Panama
Canal treaties and special Middle East negotiator during Carter
administration.
   Seymour Weiss _ national security consultant in Washington.
Served in State Department from 1955 to 1973, heading Bureau of
Politico-Military Affairs in Nixon administration. Former
ambassador to the Bahamas. Member of President's Foreign
Intelligence Advisory Board and chairman of Defense Policy Board
during Reagan administration.

<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. has reached an agreement
with East Germany's state-owned automaker to jointly build Opel
cars.
   The agreement signed Sunday by GM's West German subsidiary, Adam
Opel AG, and Automobilwerk Eisenach represents GM's second move
into Eastern Europe in recent months. GM earlier agreed to a $150
million joint venture in Hungary.
   Opel, based in Ruesselsheim near Frankfurt, and Automobilwerk
Eisenach said they hope to produce 150,000 Opels yearly at the East
German company's plant in Eisenach near the West German border.
   The cars will be marketed in East Germany, GM spokesman Jack
Harned said Sunday.
   ``This has a lot to do with the unification of Germany,'' Harned
said. ``We have a good presence in Europe. Now we'll have more of a
presence in Eastern Europe. It's a very important move for GM.''
   GM, the world's biggest automaker, did not disclose size of its
stake or its partner's in the venture. Details were to be released
later today.
   GM's venture to build vehicles with RABA, Hungary's state-owned
manufacturer of trucks, diesel engines and axles, made GM the first
U.S. automaker to invest in Eastern Europe since its political and
economic liberalization.
   Ford Motor Co. says it is watching the Eastern European market.
Chrysler Corp. sells cars in Europe but has no independent
manufacturing plants there.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Harvard has the nation's top medical school,
Stanford offers the finest business training, Yale has the premium
law school, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology is the best
place for a graduate degree in engineering, says a survey released
today.
   A school's reputation among educators and in the outside world
was a major subjective factor, said U.S. News &amp; World Report in
releasing the results of a survey evaluating U.S. graduate
education in its March 19 issue. The magazine emphasized that the
institutions receiving top ranking in the survey ``do not exercise
a monopoly on quality education.''
   ``Nevertheless, institutional reputations matter; in some
professions, they may be crucial,'' the magazine said. ``Fairly or
unfairly, the value of a degree from that institution depends in
part upon those perceptions.''
   Four professional programs were surveyed _ business,
engineering, law and medicine. Harvard and Stanford placed in the
top five in three of those categories, more than any other
institutions.
   Harvard, in addition to being tops in medicine, ranked second in
business and fifth in law. Stanford ranked second in engineering
and third among law schools in addition to its top rating for
business.
   The magazine developed its rankings after interviewing faculty
members and deans across the country since last fall. The survey
used objective standards _ quality of students accepted, value of
the degree in the job market and research spending _ along with
subjective measures such as a school's reputation.
   The subjective survey was done by the Washington office of
Market Facts Inc. The magazine says it polled ``thousands of
academic and professional authorities to determine how the experts
on and off campus perceive a given institution.''
   Although the rankings were dominated by institutions with
established reputations, the survey also identified the ``dark
horse'' institutions in each field by giving them a
``best-up-and-coming'' designation.
   Those were Washington University in St. Louis for business;
George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., for law; University of
Alabama at Birmingham for medicine; and University of California at
Santa Barbara for engineering.
   U.S. News annually ranks undergraduate colleges, but this was
its first graduate-level evaluation.
   The top schools in each category were:
   Business: Stanford; Harvard; University of Pennsylvania;
Northwestern; and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
   Engineering: MIT; Stanford; Illinois at Champaign-Urbana;
California Institute of Technology; and the University of
California at Berkeley.
   Law: Yale; University of Chicago; Stanford; Columbia; and
Harvard.
   Medical: Harvard; Johns Hopkins; Duke; University of California
at San Francisco; and Yale.

<TEXT>
   A Tokyo train line introduced seatless cars today
to reduce overcrowding during rush hours and got a mixed response
from commuters, some of whom complained of being treated like
packages.
   The new cars on the crowded Yamanote loop line have foldable
seats that can be lowered or folded back into the wall
automatically by pushing a button, a railroad official said.
   The seats will remain folded during morning rush hour to
increase the capacity of the cars and allow easier movement of
passengers on and off trains, he said.
   Regular train cars on the line have a rated capacity of 144,
while the new cars can officially carry 162 people, said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The cars actually
carry many more passengers during rush hour, when they frequently
are packed so tightly that people can hardly move.
   Only two trains with two seatless cars each were introduced
today as an a experiment, the official said.
   ``We will see how it goes and will decide whether we will
continue the experiment,'' he said.
   The reaction of passengers was divided. A middle-age commuter
interviewed by Kyodo News Service said he liked the new car because
it was less crowded, and that few people are able to sit anyway in
cars that have seats.
   Other passengers said they felt they were being treated like
packages and were riding in a freight train.
   The train official dismissed the criticism.
   ``We decided to introduce the seatless cars to give better
service and have never thought of treating our customers as
packages,'' he said.

   Edward Grady Partin, the labor leader
whose testimony sent Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa to prison in 1967,
has died at 66.
   Partin, who died Sunday at a nursing home, suffered from heart
disease and diabetes.
   A native of Woodville, Miss., Partin was business manager of
Teamsters Local 5 in Baton Rouge for 30 years.
   Partin, a close associate of Hoffa's, helped Attorney General
Robert Kennedy convict him in 1964 of jury tampering. Partin
testified Hoffa offered him $20,000 to fix the jury at Hoffa's 1962
trial on charges of taking kickbacks from a trucking company. That
trial ended in a hung jury.
   James Neal, a prosecutor in the jury-tampering trial in
Chattanooga, Tenn., said that when Partin walked in the courtroom,
Hoffa gasped, ``My God, it's Partin.''
   The government later spent 11 years prosecuting Partin on labor
corruption charges before he went to prison in 1980 for conspiracy
to obstruct justice by hiding witnesses and arranging for perjured
testimony.
   While in prison, he pleaded no contest to conspiracy,
racketeering and embezzling $450,000 in union money. He was
released to a halfway house in 1986.
   Union members at one time voted to continue paying his salary
while he was in prison. He was removed from office in 1981.
   Funeral services were scheduled for Tuesday.
   Survivors include his mother, two brothers, a sister, five
daughters, two sons, two brothers and several grandchildren and
great-grandchildren.

<HEAD>Researcher: Archbishop Too Hasty in Seeking AIDS Vaccine
Volunteers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Roman Catholic archbishop of Los Angeles
acted too hastily in sending letters to elderly priests and nuns
seeking volunteers to test an experimental AIDS vaccine, a key
researcher said.
   Even the prototype vaccine's developer, Dr. Jonas Salk, the
75-year-old pioneer of the polio vaccine, was unaware of the appeal
by Archbishop Roger Mahony, said Dr. Alexandra Levine of the
University of Southern California.
   ``A plan to send letters seeking volunteers from the clergy had
been agreed upon,'' Levine said. ``But we had no intention of
sending the letters until after all of the necessary approvals for
the study had been granted.''
   Mahony, in Italy for a visit to the Vatican, confirmed he sent
letters to 2,500 priests and nuns in January.
   Mahony said he was contacted by Dr. Brian Henderson of the
Norris Cancer Institute at the University of Southern California,
who was working with Salk and seeking volunteers. Levine works with
Henderson and Salk.
   ``(You're) looking for people who would want to volunteer for
something that could be very risky,'' Mahony said in an interview.
``You're really looking for people who have a commitment to
humankind and willingness to take risks to benefit others.''
   Because the vaccine contains deactivated AIDS virus, there is a
possibility that people injected with it could become infected,
just as many Americans were infected with polio in the early 1950s
when Salk used the same technique to develop the vaccine that
eventually saved thousands from the crippling disease.
   The infections resulted because some traces of the virus
contained in the polio vaccine hadn't been killed.
   The state Department of Health Services is considering the
request from researchers at USC to test 10 uninfected individuals
who are at very low risk of AIDS infection, Levine said.
   On Sunday, Cardinal John O'Connor, who heads the New York
archdiocese, said he would consider trying an AIDS vaccine himself
if volunteers were needed and other members of his archdiocese
wanted him to participate.
   ``Anything that is morally licit and makes a contribution should
be considered,'' said O'Connor, 70.
   Henderson, who was the attending physician for the late Cardinal
Timothy Manning, could not be reached by telephone Sunday.
   Already 100 people infected with the AIDS virus have been
inoculated with Salk's vaccine, and the Food and Drug
Administration has approved national tests for 1,000 others, Levine
said.
   Levine is hoping tests on healthy volunteers will stimulate
their immune systems to produce large quantities of antibodies
against the AIDS virus. Those antibodies, in turn, would be removed
from the bloodstream, purified and injected into AIDS patients,
whose immune systems cannot produce antibodies.
   In addition, tests on healthy people may lay the foundation for
a vaccine to prevent AIDS, Levine said.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Police looking for the killer of an
army major stopped a young man, shot him four times at close range
and sat under a tree watching him die for more than an hour,
witnesses said.
   More than a dozen police officers shot at photojournalists to
keep them from helping the young man and taking pictures, the
photographers said.
   The attack on the young man Sunday occurred a day after Haiti's
military ruler, Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, relinquished of power.
   The news photographers said they saw policemen stop a man in his
20s wearing red shorts at 12:30 p.m. near where Army Maj. Renaud
St. Bert was killed on Saturday.
   ``People in the area said he was an innocent passer-by,''
Associated Press photographer Scott Applewhite said.
   Officers threw the man against a pickup truck, said Les Stone, a
New York City-based free-lance photographer. Stone said the man was
then shot four times at point-blank range in the stomach, buttocks
and elbow with an M-16 rifle.
   ``He lay there dying on the black asphalt under the noon sun,
moving his head now and then, and they didn't do anything to help
him,'' said Applewhite, who arrived shortly after the shooting.
   ``Though there were bystanders who would have helped, the police
wouldn't let anybody approach,'' said Applewhite. ``Police shot at
us.''
   ``I am not aware of this incident,'' Maj. Jean Robert Rene,
police commander of the Delmar district of Port-au-Prince where the
incident occurred, said in a telephone interview.
   Policemen allowed a Red Cross ambulance to pick up the man two
hours after he was shot, Applewhite said. He followed the man to
the hospital and said he died shortly after 3 p.m. on an operating
table.
   ``Just as they brought in three bags of blood, his arm dropped
and he died with his eyes open,'' Applewhite said.

<HEAD>Miami Tribe Awaits Federal Recognition to Pursue Economic Plans</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Stripped of recognition by the U.S. government
in 1897, the Miami Indian tribe has pinned its hopes of prosperity
on regaining its identity.
   Federal recognition could translate into millions in economic
aid and social services, while helping to preserve the identity of
the 6,000-member tribe, based for centuries in the flat woodlands
of northern Indiana.
   Since 1980, the tribe has submitted 10 volumes of documentation,
including the names of each tribe member. Proof of the tribe's
longstanding existence includes the Indiana towns named after
Chiefs Muncie and Kokomo.
   The Bureau of Indian Affairs has promised to try to decide on
recognition by Friday, although officials said the decision could
be delayed.
   ``I don't see how it could go against us because the Miamis are
probably the best documented tribe east of the Mississippi,''
tribal chairman Raymond White said last week. ``The word out in
Indian country and Washington is that if the Miamis don't make it,
there won't be another tribe that will make it.''
   Under guidelines set up in 1978, landless tribes can gain access
to federal aid and other advantages once they gain official
recognition.
   The recognition process has proved to be a bureaucratic
nightmare for the more than 100 tribes that have applied, mostly
small tribes from the East and West coasts. Seven have been
acknowledged and 12 denied, said BIA spokesman Carl Shaw.
   Recognition would allow the Miami nation to set tax rates for
its businesses, sell tax-free municipal bonds and become eligible
for programs administered by the BIA and the Indian Health Service.
   White, who runs the tribe on behalf of its ailing, 75-year-old
chief, Francisco Shoemaker, has ambitious plans for the Miamis.
   Under his guidance, the tribe in December started a joint
venture with Medi-Mail Inc., a San Diego, Calif., drug distributor.
The tribe finds customers among Indian clinics and hospitals around
the country for Medi-Mail.
   Recognition could open the door to a federal loan to expand the
tribe's pharmacy business. The tribe also has plans for a 50-unit,
federally funded housing complex and a health clinic in Peru.
   The drug warehouse and other projects would create about 100
jobs for the Miamis, about 2,000 of whom are scattered among eight
northern Indiana counties, White said. The tribe has no land of its
own.
   The tribe is working with the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources to build a resort on the Mississinewa River near Peru.
   ``In a year to 18 months there would be $60 to $100 million in
development started if federal recognition comes through,'' White
said.
   For now, said White _ who also works full-time as a machine
repairman at General Motors in Anderson _ the tribe is broke. ``We
don't even have a budget. We're on a shoestring,'' he said.
   Mayor Richard Blair said recognition for the Miamis would
provide a boost to the economy of Miami County. ``The feeling is
positive,'' he said. ``Our heritage goes back a long way with the
Indians.''
   In fact, the Miamis' heritage goes back a bit further than that
of the town.
   Once based in what is now Wisconsin, the tribe began hunting and
fishing the area around the Mississinewa River in the 1650s. In
1816, Indiana became a state, and in 1846 the government forced
much of the tribe to relocate to Oklahoma.
   The Miamis lost their treaty rights in 1893; the Oklahoma Miamis
recently won federal recognition in a separate petition.

   Here is a glance at the drives for independence or
greater autonomy in other Soviet republics following Lithuania's
declaration of independence Sunday:
   ESTONIA _ The People's Front in the Baltic republic of Estonia
demands independence from the Soviet Union, but is moving more
slowly than Lithuania. In local elections Dec. 10, non-Communists
won about half the ballots. On Sunday an informal gathering calling
itself the Estonian Congress called for restoration of complete
independence with U.N. help.
   LATVIA _ The pro-independence People's Front won more than half
the votes in local elections in December, signaling that it is
likely to do well when it elects a new legislature March 18. Latvia
last December became the second Baltic republic, after Lithuania,
to abolish the Communist Party's constitutional monopoly on power.
   GEORGIA _ Nationalists are demanding independence from the
Soviet Union and the republic's parliament has condemned its
forcible annexation to the Soviet Union in 1921. Georgians vote for
a new Supreme Soviet legislature on June 17, and independence will
be a key campaign issue.
   MOLDAVIA _ The Moldavian Popular Front, an independent political
movement, is the main challenger to the Communist Party. The front
initially wants political sovereignty from the Kremlin, followed
eventually by full independence from the Soviet Union.
   UKRAINE _ A nascent nationalist movement is emerging in the
Ukraine, the Soviet Union's second-largest republic. Rukh, the
organization of progressive nationalists, is the most vocal of
several movements demanding an independent Ukraine. Rukh and other
reform groups leaders say they expect to win about 25 percent of
Supreme Soviet seats in runoff elections to be held later in the
month.
   AZERBAIJAN _ Some Azerbaijanis, a Turkic and predominantly
Shiite Moslem people, want to be united with their brethren across
the border with Iran. In unrest in January, some tore down border
fences with Iran. Azerbaijan is engaged in a bitter dispute with
neighboring Armenia over control of the Nagorno-Karabakh territory
that has sapped the authority of Moscow in both republics.

<HEAD>Selma Mayor: City Hall Protesters Violating Court Order</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SELMA, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blacks protesting the ouster of Selma's
school superintendent defied a court order today and spent the
night inside City Hall and in tents on the lawn.
   ``We're waiting to notify the judge that they're violating the
order,'' said Mayor Joe Smitherman.
   About half a dozen protesters were inside City Hall over the
weekend and slept there this morning and in two tents pitched in
front.
   Circuit Judge Leslie Johnson on Saturday had barred protesters
from spending the night, eating and playing cards in City Hall or
disrupting City Council business.
   Dallas County Commissioner Perry Varner, one of the protesters,
said they might begin complying with the order today. But he added
sarcastically: ``We just got the order and it might take us two
days to read it because they've tracked us into lower levels, you
know.''
   One of the protesters' complaints is ``tracking,'' in which
black students are supposedly placed in lower-level classes.
   City Hall has been in an uproar since the white-controlled
school board decided Dec. 21 against renewing the $80,000-a-year
contract of superintendent Norward Roussell, Selma's first black
schools chief.
   School board meetings have turned into shouting matches,
students and teachers have boycotted class and protesters have
occupied City Hall. The 6,000-student system was closed for several
days in February for fear of violence.
   Smitherman said he was unsure what action the city might ask the
judge to take against the protesters at another hearing set for
this week or early next week. ``He could fine them, jail them, or
both,'' the mayor siad.
   Roussell, who has held the job 2{ years, blamed his dismissal on
racism. The school board cited differences over management.
   A commemoration of the 1965 Selma-to-Montgomery voting rights
march ended Saturday with some 3,000 people at the Alabama Capitol.
The march helped spur passage of the federal Voting Rights Act.

<HEAD>Dollar Highest In 2{ Years, Tokyo Stocks Plunge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar hit its highest level against the
Japanese yen in Tokyo in more than 2{ years today, sending prices
plunging on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, traders said.
   The dollar rose above the psychologically important 152-yen
level early in the day and ended the day's trading at exactly
152.00 yen despite profit-taking and extensive central bank
intervention, they said.
   It was the U.S. currency's highest close in Tokyo since Aug. 14,
1987, when it finished at 152.40 yen.
   The dollar began the day at 151.68 yen, up from last Friday's
close of 151.15 yen, and ranged between 151.60 yen and 152.18 yen.
   Participants predicted the dollar would move into the middle of
the 152-yen range this week but remained wary of central bank
intervention. Low volume in Tokyo because of the end of the
Japanese fiscal year this month rules out a sudden rise, they said.
   The yen's decline sent stocks sharply lower in slow trading, as
selling late in the afternoon by arbitrageurs boosted losses in the
Nikkei Stock Average, traders said.
   The 225-share Nikkei index, which rose 302.23 points Friday,
dropped 624.89 points, or 1.84 percent, today to close at
33,368.23, due in part to program selling linked to stock-index
arbitrage, in which traders profit from price differences in the
spot and futures markets, dealers said.
   Many participants stayed on the sidelines because of the yen's
decline against the dollar, dealers said.
   Yoshio Shimoyoma, general manager of stock trading at Nikko
Securities, said the yen's weakness didn't immediately cause large
amounts of selling but caused a decline in buying interest, which
in turn allowed a small amount of selling and arbitrage trading to
push the Nikkei down sharply.
   Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 370
million shares, down from 664 million shares Friday.
   Bargain hunting by individual investors, encouraged by strong
advances late last week, pushed the Nikkei above 34,000 points
during the first 30 minutes of trading, dealers said. But the
decline of the yen quickly reversed the Nikkei's direction, they
said.
   The dollar was bolstered by its strong showing in New York
Friday following the announcement of better-than-expected U.S.
employment figures for February, said Toru Kanai, a foreign
exchange analyst with New Japan Securities Co.
   The employment statistics showed that the United States found
jobs for 372,000 more non-agricultural workers last month, compared
to about 250,000 expected prior to the release.
   Traders said the Bank of Japan, the central bank, intervened
repeatedly and sizeably in the market in an effort to stem the
yen's fall. The bank normally does not comment on the amount of its
market interventions.
   The yen's weakness, combined with lower bond prices and the
falling stock futures index ``reminded traders how bearish the
market still is,'' said an official at Wako Securities, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   Although traders enjoyed a brief bullish respite late last week,
they saw bearish market sentiment quickly re-establish itself when
the yen continued to fall on the foreign exchange market, he said.
   Yields on benchmark No. 119 10-year government bonds closed at
7.240 percent, up from 7.160 percent at the market's closing Friday.

   An explosion and flash fire killed
three workers renovating an empty 80,000-barrel oil storage tank at
a refinery.
   The workmen were cutting the top off the steel tank at the
Kerr-McGee Refinery on Sunday when a spark ignited vapors that had
built up despite a ventilation fan, said Webster Parish coroner's
investigator T.C. Bloxom.
   ``The buildup triggered an explosion forceful enough to blow the
top off the tank, and that's one of the biggest tanks on the
premises,'' Bloxom said.
   Kerr-McGee employees extinguished the fire, but it took three
hours for the tank to cool enough for rescue workers in protective
clothing to be lowered in to recover the bodies, Bloxom said.
   The victims worked for Baker Tank, an Arp, Texas, subcontractor
hired to renovate the tank.
   Four men were hurt, two seriously, in explosions at the
Kerr-McGee plant in 1982.

<HEAD>Chinese Premier To Make Historic Moscow Visit Next Month</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Li Peng will travel to Moscow in late
April in the first visit by a Chinese head of government to the
Soviet Union in nearly 30 years, Soviet sources say.
   Li's trip, scheduled to begin April 23 or 24, follows the
dramatic visit to Beijing by Soviet President Michael S. Gorbachev
last May that ended three decades of bad blood between the two
Communist neighbors.
   The exchange of visits, however, has come against a background
of swiftly unfolding events that largely eliminated fears or
expectations that a Sino-Soviet rapprochement would transform world
strategic alliances.
   Gorbachev's visit was overshadowed by student-led pro-democracy
demonstrations in Beijing that led to a violent military crackdown
in June and the ascendancy of a new hard-line leadership.
   Li's trip comes at a time of radical political and economic
changes in the Soviet Union that have again dislocated any
ideological compatibility the two sides might have had.
   Although China has not openly criticized the Soviet Union,
senior leader Deng Xiaoping in internal speeches has reportedly
accused Gorbachev of ``revisionism,'' a word used by Mao Tse-tung
in condemning Nikita Khrushchev in the 1950s.
   Disputes between Mao and Khrushchev over ideology and leadership
of the Communist world led to a final break in 1960 when the
Soviets withdrew all their technical advisers from China.
   The last Chinese premier to visit Moscow was Chou En-lai, who
attended a Soviet party congress in October 1961. Chou avoided
meeting Khrushchev, blasted his policy of detente with the West and
scorned the Soviet leader by laying a wreath on the tomb of his
discredited predecessor Stalin.
   Li, who studied engineering at the Moscow Power Institute from
1948 to 1954, is said to speak Russian and has long been identified
with Soviet-style central planning and stress on heavy industry.
   In December 1985, then-Vice Premier Li made a surprise stopover
in Moscow on his way home from a European tour for a meeting with
Gorbachev to promote warming relations between the two countries.
   The 61-year-old premier has denied, however, that he is
pro-Soviet, and his talks in Moscow are not expected to produce any
major agreements. The two sides could reach interim accords on
ongoing talks to settle border disputes or lessen military
confrontation on the 4,300-mile frontier.
   Increasing trade will also be on the agenda, as well as such
international issues as Cambodia, Afghanistan, East Europe and arms
reduction.

   Estonians have appealed to the United
Nations for help in breaking away from Moscow, calling for
peacekeeping forces that would monitor an end to what they called
50 years of Soviet occupation.
   The proclamation Sunday by the unsanctioned but popularly
elected congress came the same day Baltic neighbor Lithuania
declared independence from the Soviet Union and two days after the
republic of Georgia condemned the Soviet annexation of its
territory.
   Today, the Estonian congress was scheduled to discuss the
republic's borders and the status of non-Estonian residents. It is
to elect a 77-member council, which will be charged with
negotiating independence with officials in Moscow.
   The 499-member congress has no formal political power. But it
considers itself the highest representative body of ethnic
Estonians living in the republic and abroad.
   The congress on Sunday appealed to the United Nations to demand
that ``the Soviet Union restore the independence and sovereignty of
the republic of Estonia.'' It called for the help of international
peacekeeping forces during a transition period.
   There was no immediate comment from U.N. officials.
   The congress also said in its declaration that Estonia was
illegally annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940 and is ``to this day
still occupied by the U.S.S.R.''
   The congress said it is willing to work with the Estonian
Supreme Soviet legislature for independence. But delegates are
expecting many Communists in the Supreme Soviet to be swept out of
office in elections March 18.
   So far the congress has only hopes that Soviet leaders will meet
with its representatives.
   ``It is not a question of whether we want independence or not;
it's a question of what kind of independence we want,'' said
delegate Tunne Kelam, who opened the congress.
   Kelam said Gorbachev's demand of Lithuania for $34 billion in
compensation for Moscow's decades of investment was a political
ploy.
   ``It's just propaganda. Even if Estonia gets such a bill, our
bill for damages from Moscow during 50 years of occupation would be
much greater,'' Kelam said in an interview.
   However, in contrast to Lithuania and the third Baltic republic,
Latvia, Estonia is treading a careful line. Estonia has a
population of only 1.6 million.
   ``We don't dare take the bull by the horns _ not at this point
in time. We must not provoke Moscow,'' Kelam said.
   The delegates to the congress included leading representatives
of newly established political parties opposing the ruling
Communists, but no high-ranking government officials.
   On Friday the Georgian Supreme Soviet legislature denounced the
Soviet occupation and annexation of Georgia and called for talks on
restoring Georgian independence.
   The Red Army occupied Georgia in 1921 and subsequent treaties
made Georgia part of the Soviet Union.

   Three boys unwittingly used a wrapped-up human
head as a soccer ball before the father of one of the youngsters
realized what it was, police said today.
   The head, found in the South Bronx on Saturday, may belong to a
torso discovered along in a wooded area in Manhattan on March 4,
police said.
   The boys, ages 9, 10 and 13, apparently pulled the head wrapped
in rags out of a box of trash next to a fire hydrant on a dead end
street, said police spokeswoman Sgt. Mary Wrensen.
   ``The kids started to play soccer with the object and then threw
it into a trash can containing a fire,'' she said.
   Ralph Rodriguez was washing his car at the hydrant, Wrensen
said. After the object went into the fire, Rodriguez noticed a leg
sticking out of a garbage bag in the box and realized what the
``ball'' was.
   He looked closer and found arms and legs, police said.
   Area residents call the block ``the morgue,'' because five
bodies have been found there in the past two years, the Daily News
reported.

<HEAD>Toll Workers' Illness May Have Been Psychosomatic</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An epidemic of dizziness, chest pain and sore
throats among toll takers may have been at least partly
psychosomatic, officials say.
   Between Feb. 16 and 22, 34 workers at the Triborough Bridge
suffered such symptoms. Chemical fumes were suspected, and health
and environmental experts investigated many possibilities but
learned nothing, officials said.
   Medical experts said some of the characteristics of the plague
were consistent with epidemic stress syndrome, or the spread of a
psychosomatic illness through a group, The New York Times reported
today.
   Anthony M. Mauro, president of the bridge and tunnel workers'
union, said, ``I think the first 20 or 25 actually experienced
heavy, non-breathable fumes.'' But he acknowledged the rest may
have succumbed to anxiety.
   Bridge officials similarly concluded that the outbreak had a
psychosomatic element _ but would not say so without assurances of
anonymity, the Times said.
   ``It's a political hot potato to go on the record and say that
it's psychological. The union will go wild,'' an unidentified
official told the paper.
   Sheila L. Kennedy, a spokeswoman for the Triborough Bridge and
Tunnel Authority, was asked whether some of the symptoms may have
been in the workers' minds. She said, ``It's very, very, very
possible, but we can't conclude that.''
   ``Can we prove it? No. I don't think we want to prove it. These
people work very hard, and we don't want to make little of what
happens to them,'' she said.
   Dizziness and head, throat or chest pain are among the most
common complaints in epidemic stress syndrome, the Times reported.
   Bridge officials checked the workers' drinking water, uniform
launderers, coins, coffee grounds, heating ducts and air vents.
They examined nearby factory smokestacks and the heating system of
a sewage treatment plant.
   Thomas M. Downs, TBTA president, said nearly $1 million was
spent in the search.

   A former aide to the presidential
candidate assassinated by drug bosses has won the governing party's
presidential nomination, and heads into the May general election as
the front-runner.
   Cesar Gaviria of the governing Liberal Party claimed victory in
Sunday's presidential primary, the first in the country's history,
after all five of his rivals conceded defeat. He is favored to win
the general election in May.
   ``This was Luis Carlos Galan's victory,'' Gaviria said,
referring to the popular candidate whose slaying in August touched
off a bloody war between the government and drug barons.
   Speaking to reporters late Sunday at a victory celebration at
his Bogota headquarters, the 43-year-old Gaviria added that the win
was bittersweet because Galan had died before ``the triumph of his
ideas.''
   Gaviria had been Galan's campaign manager.
   An economist by training, Gaviria has pledged to follow Galan's
political program, including his strong committment to fighting the
power of the country's cocaine cartels. But the candidate has said
he may try suspected drug traffickers in Colombia rather than
extradite them to the United States.
   In the May 27 elections, Gaviria is to face 47-year-old Rodrigo
Lloreda, chosen as the opposition Conservative Party candidate at a
national convention in November. President Virgilio Barco is barred
by the constitution from running for re-election. The presidential
terms is four years.
   With approximately 15 percent of the precints reporting in
Sunday's primary, Gaviria had received 403,611 votes or 59.7
percent of the total while his nearest opponent, Ernesto Samper,
had won 123,917 or 18.3 percent. The RCN radio network compiled the
figures from counts by regional voting boards.
   The National Voting Registry had not made its own compilation by
early this morning.
   Elections were also held Sunday for federal, state and local
offices.
   RCN and another radio network, Caracol, predicted that the
Liberal Party would win 60 percent of the 313 seats in the
country's legislature while the Conservative Party, the main
opposition, would win 37 percent.
   The Liberals previously held 178 seats, or 57 percent, and the
Conservatives 126 seats, or 40 percent.
   Former leftist guerrillas from the April 19 Movement, or M19,
were said to have received a small but significant vote,
considering that they had laid down their arms and formed a
political party only 48 hours before the polls opened.
   M19 members were in the running in two of the 1,005 mayor's
races throughout the country.
   The day's only fatal election violence occurred when police shot
and killed a member of another guerrilla group in a confrontation
in the southeastern town of Puerto Nidia, said Gen. Nelson Mejia,
the commander of the country's armed forces.
   Political violence left six dead on Saturday, officials said.
   The Liberal Party recaptured the Bogota's mayor's office, but
the Conservatives won the office in Cali, Colombia's third largest
city and were neck and neck with Liberal candidates in Medellin and
Barranquilla, RCN said.
   Colombians also voted for or against a non-binding resolution to
call a national assembly to reform the country's constitution. The
proposed reforms are aimed at increasing the public's political
participation and reducing political patronage and corruption.
   Extradition has been Barco's main weapon in his antidrug
crackdown, which began hours after Galan's death. The
administration has sent 14 drug suspects to the United States for
trial and has maintained the policy despite an offer by Medellin
cartel leaders to surrender if extradition is ended.
   Traffickers responded with 262 terrorist attacks, mostly
bombings, that killed 209 people.
   They called a unilateral truce in the drug war on Jan. 17 and
have said they are willing to surrender their illicit business and
themselves if the government scraps its extradition policy and
promises to try them in Colombia.

   Nelson Mandela arrived today for a
reunion with fellow anti-apartheid campaigner Oliver Tambo in the
country that has been the major Western supporter of the struggle
against apartheid.
   A jubilant crowd of Swedes and Africans greeted Mandela and his
wife, Winnie, at Stockholm airport. Standing in the remains of an
overnight snowfall, they performed the toyi'toyi foot-stamping
dance made popular by South African activists.
   Mandela was expected later today to have a quiet and private
meeting with African National Congress president Tambo, recovering
in a Stockholm clinic from a stroke.
   The two men, once law partners, have not seen each other since
Mandela was jailed in South Africa 27 years ago and Tambo went into
exile. South African President F. W. de Klerk freed Mandela and
legalized the ANC last month in moves intended to promote
white-black negotiations.
   Black nationalists seek a one-man one-vote system that would end
racial segregation, while the government insists that group rights
must be preserved for minorities, including whites.
   Now deputy president of the ANC and its effective leader,
Mandela had planned to cut short his weeklong Swedish stay and
leave for South Africa Thursday.
   He was reported concerned by growing unrest in black homelands
and townships, and a warning by the South African government that
it might intervene with emergency powers to end the violence.
   But an ANC spokesman said today that Mandela will stay in Sweden
until Saturday, as originally scheduled. Unofficial sources said
the Swedish government, which is to give the ANC $45 million in
non-military aid this year, had urged Mandela to stay on.
   On his first trip outside Africa since his release, Mandela came
from Tanzania, where he had been examined by a doctor after
complaining of fatigue.
   On Tuesday he is scheduled to give a news conference and address
Parliament. The rest of the week is largely filled with private
appointments, including an expected meeting with British Labor
Party leader Neil Kinnock and further sessions with Tambo.
   Cyril Ramaphosa, a member of Mandela's delegation, said during a
stopover in the Netherlands that Mandela is likely to travel to the
United States this year, where he has been invited by President
Bush.

   The dollar rose in calm trading in Europe late
this morning, bolstered by a weak yen, uncertainty about the West
German mark and stronger-than-expected U.S. employment figures
released last week. Gold prices also rose.
   Investors were cautious, waiting to see if central banks would
return to the market after last week's repeated interventions to
curb the dollar, traders said.
   The dollar rose to 152 yen in Tokyo, its highest rate in more
than 2{ years, and that pulled the U.S. currency up against the
West German mark in Europe, dealers said.
   But one Milan trader said: ``There's fear that the (West German)
Bundesbank is going to step in and knock the dollar lower.''
   In London, the dollar rose strongly against the British pound,
which was quoted at $1.6080, compared with $1.6183 late Friday.
Dealers cited Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's recent decline in
the opinion polls, reported jitters among Cabinet members about her
leadership and last week's violent protests against the
government's new local tax on individuals.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Friday:
   _ 1.7069 West German marks, up from 1.7040
   _ 1.5130 Swiss francs, up from 1.5115
   _ 5.7700 French francs, up from 5.7615
   _ 1.9205 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9150
   _ 1,261.00 Italian lire, up from 1,258.75
   _ 1.1800 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1792
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.85 yen to a closing 152.00 yen. That was its
highest level since August 1987. Later, in London, it was quoted at
a higher rate of 152.25 yen.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $399.50 a troy ounce, up
from $399.05 bid late Friday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $400.40.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $400.40, up from $399.50 late
Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 27 cents to close at a bid
$401.02.
   Silver rose in London to a bid price of $5.12 a troy ounce, from
Friday's $5.11.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Reported Disciplined for Letting Tape Play in Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has suspended a federal prosecutor
who publicly disclosed a tape recording on which an alleged mobster
boasted of bribing a local Republican leader, a published report
says.
   The tape, recorded secretly for federal agents, was played last
month during a court detention hearing and set off a political
uproar.
   The Chicago Tribune, quoting unidentified sources, reported
Saturday that Jeffrey M. Johnson, a 17-year veteran prosecutor, was
suspended for two weeks without pay.
   The U.S. Justice Department suspended Johnson, an organized
crime specialist with the U.S. attorney's office in Chicago, at the
request of acting U.S. Attorney Ira Raphaelson, and the suspension
began a week ago, the newspaper reported.
   Raphaelson refused to acknowledge the suspension, and David
Runkel, a spokesman for the Justice Department in Washington, D.C.,
said he had no knowlege of it, the Tribune reported Saturday.
   Nobody answered the telephone at Johnson's office during the
weekend, and attempts by The Associated Press to reach him at home
by calling several people with his name in the telephone book were
unsuccessful. There also was no answer at Raphaelson's office, and
his home number was unlisted.
   Rocco Infelise, a reputed crime syndicate gambling boss, was
recorded saying he made payoffs to law-enforcement officials.
   Infelise said he had been making $35,000 in payoffs to police
and officials each month, including $10,000 a month to the
sheriff's office through somebody called the Bohemian.
   An IRS agent said in court that an informant had identified the
Bohemian as James Dvorak, a former top aide in the Cook County
sheriff's office and current chairman of the Cook County GOP.
   Dvorak denied wrongdoing and has survived efforts by fellow
Republicans to have him replaced as GOP chairman. He complained to
Raphaelson that Infelise's allegations were untrue, and that
releasing them to the public was unfair and seemed to lend them
credence.
   The tape was recorded Sept. 14 by an alleged
bookie-turned-government informant who was wearing a recording
device.
   Infelise also boasted on the tape that he helped Chicago Mayor
Richard M. Daley win election last year by discouraging campaign
contributions to a Daley opponent. Daley dismissed the remark as a
fabrication.
   Infelise and others who were subjects of the detention hearing
were among 20 people indicted on a variety of charges, including
murder conspiracy, gambling and racketeering.

<TEXT>
   The leader of Iran's radical faction said
some of the foreigners kidnapped in Lebanon were spies and argued
against releasing any of what he called the ``mercenary U.S.
hostages.''
   The comment came in an editorial signed by Ali Akbar Mohtashemi
that was published Saturday in Tehran's Persian-language Kayhan and
made available today in Nicosia.
   Also today, the official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted the
son of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini as accusing the United
States of falsely trying to imply that ties with Iran are improving.
   Mohtashemi is a former interior minister who heads the faction
that opposes President Hashemi Rafsanjani's openings to the West.
In the editorial he attacked those who suggest Iran should help get
the hostages freed.
   ``The Islamic Republic of Iran cannot and should not impose its
policies and views on other Moslem nations,'' he wrote.
``Furthermore, the freedom of the hostages means breaking the
chains of bloodthirsty wolves.''
   ``The sentence for a spy in an Islamic country is death,''
Mohtashemi wrote.
   The Westerners held in Lebanon are eight Americans, four
Britons, two West Germans, two Swiss, an Irishman and an Italian.
   The longest held is Terry Anderson, 42, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   Mohtashemi said a recent call for the hostages' release in the
Tehran Times, which is aligned with Rafsanjani, and similar
comments by Lebanese Shiite Moslem spiritual leader Mohammed
Hussein Fadlallah ``heightened the pressure on the Islamic
revolution and the Moslems of Lebanon.''
   ``Instead of putting pressure on the wronged Lebanese Moslems to
release the mercenary U.S. hostages, world public opinion should
look for the center of hostage-taking at the White House and among
Western and American intelligence services,'' he wrote.
   He claimed that some of the hostages were spies for the CIA,
specifically naming Terry Waite, the British envoy of the
archbishop of Canterbury who disappeared in West Beirut in January
1987. The church has denied this.
   Mohtashemi also said Col. William Higgins was a spy for the CIA.
The United States has denied that. Higgins' captors said in July
1989 they had executed him.
   Khomeini's son Ahmad said Washington was trying to create the
impression that ``relations between Iran and the United States are
so close that when a person impersonates the Iranian president and
calls up the U.S. president, he easily talks to that person,'' IRNA
reported.
   He was referring to the incident a month ago when President Bush
spoke on the phone to an impostor who claimed to be President
Hashemi Rafsanjani.
   His comment echoed editorials Sunday in two radical Tehran
newspapers, Jomhuri Islami and Abrar. They wrote that the United
States was trying to ``insinuate'' that relations with Tehran are
improving.

   Three Democratic candidates for governor are
fighting to keep their runoff hopes alive and the Republican
primary field is hoping just to keep oilman Clayton Williams from a
landslide.
   Severe thunderstorms hampered campaign plans Sunday for the
candidates vying to replace retiring Gov. Bill Clements in
Tuesday's primary elections.
   Poll results printed in Sunday's Dallas Morning News and the
Houston Chronicle dampened hopes for opponents of Williams, who is
favored by 55 percent of those interviewed for the GOP primary.
   Williams has spent about $6 million of his own money in his
first bid for public office. State Railroad Commissioner Kent
Hance, initially perceived as the front-runner, trailed with 13
percent, followed by Houston businessman Jack Rains and Dallas
lawyer Tom Luce with 8 percent each.
   On the Democratic side, State Treasurer Ann Richards had the
support of 28 percent of voters, Attorney General Jim Mattox had 25
percent and former Gov. Mark White had 24 percent.
   White criticized Ms. Richards' campaign for distributing a flier
at black churches Sunday that said White had lied about supporting
minorities.
   ``I think that mind-altering drugs may have longer term
(effects) as far as her campaign is concerned,'' White said. ``Ten
years may not be long enough.''
   Ms. Richards has said she hasn't been under the influence of a
mind-altering chemical in 10 years, since she was treated for
alcoholism. She called White's remarks ``really pathetic.''
   Mattox, in southern Texas, criticized Ms. Richards for what he
termed her ``gutter-style'' campaign.
   Richard Murray of the Public Policy Center at the University of
Houston, which conducted the poll, said the Democrats appeared
destined for a runoff. ``There could be a lot of movement over the
weekend,'' he said, making the runoff mates impossible to predict.
   In the GOP race, ``the question is not `Will Williams fall under
50,' but `Will he get over 60?''' Murray said.
   If no candidate finishes with more than half the vote, the top
two vote-getters face each other in an April 10 runoff.
   The policy center polled 848 people between March 4 and March 7.
The poll's margin of error was plus or minus 5 percentage points
for Republicans and 4.5 percentage points for Democrats, Murray
said.

   Vice President Dan Quayle shook hands and
chatted today with outgoing Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, the
leftist leader long shunned by the United States.
   Ortega and Quayle met inside the city's municipal cathedral at a
mass celebrating Sunday's inauguration of Chilean President
Patricio Aylwin. It was not immediately known what they talked
about; the encounter was a casual one as thousands of people
arrived for the early morning service.
   The scene was in contrast to past diplomatic occasions when
high-level U.S. officials including Quayle and President Bush
shunned Ortega, who was voted out of office Feb. 25. At meeting in
Costa Rica last October, Bush referred to Ortega as a ``little
man'' trying to crash the party.
   Quayle and Ortega were to meet again today at a luncheon given
by Aylwin for visiting dignitaries.
   Quayle said at the outset of his week-long Latin America trip
last Friday that he would be willing to meet with Ortega. And
Ortega, arriving in Santiago Sunday night, told reporters ``I think
it will be a good opportunity to talk with Vice President Quayle.''
   Asked what he would expect to cover in such a meeting, Ortega
said, ``We have a vast array of subjects to discuss with the U.S.''
He declined to elaborate.
   Quayle's chief of staff, Bill Kristol, said later, ``I suspect
they'll have a chance to talk one way or the other. We'll see what
happens tomorrow.''
   Ortega and his Sandinista government were treated with hostility
by the Bush administration. But Quayle said last week, ``There's no
reason we shouldn't talk'' because ``it's a different situation
now'' since Ortega was ousted in Nicaragua's Feb. 25 election by
U.S.-backed candidate Violeta Chamorro.
   In addition, Quayle today was meeting with Costa Rican President
Oscar Arias, who won a Nobel peace prize for spearheading the
regional peace process that ultimately led to the election that
ousted Ortega.
   The vice president also scheduled a meeting with Aylwin to
discuss prospects for changing the U.S. military aid and trade
sanctions imposed against Chile in protest of the harsh rule of
Gen. Augusto Pinochet, who stepped down Sunday.
   ``We will improve relations. I look forward to a very good
meeting with President Aylwin tomorrow to discuss how we can make
progress,'' Quayle told reporters Sunday.
   Ongoing discussions over Nicaragua center on how to achieve
demobilization of the U.S.-supported Contra rebels and pass the
reins of government to Mrs. Violeta Chamorro.
   U.S. officials are pressing the idea that the Contras could
return to Nicaragua and remain temporarily in enclaves under
supervision of United Nations forces.
   Arias and Ortega did not attend Aylwin's inauguration on Sunday.
They were flying from Venezuela with President Carlos Andres Perez
aboard a plane provided by Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez.
   Ortega said they had talked during the flight about the Contra
situation and bringing peace to the region. He said they agreed
there should be a meeting of the Central American presidents at the
end of this month to talk about demobilizing the Contras and the
peace process.
   Ortega and Arias were among leaders who chose to miss the
inauguration rather than have to pay a protocol visit to Pinochet.
   But Quayle said it was ``the right thing'' to make such a call,
and he visited Pinochet's home on Sunday morning.
   Quayle was jeered by about 400 pro-Pinochet demonstrators as his
limousine drove up. They complained that the United States had been
unfair in its diplomatic and trade pressures on Pinochet.
   Pinochet, under the constitution his regime wrote, still retains
power of Chile's armed forces, but Quayle said after the 35-minute
meeting that the general had promised him he would respect Aylwin's
authority.
   He said Pinochet assured him ``there would be no problems
between himself and President Aylwin _ when President Aylwin gave
an order that order would be complied with.''
   Later, as thousands massed in the square outside the
presidential palace, scattered violence broke out between political
partisans. Police used tear gas that affected some Quayle aides who
were readying his motorcade for him to attend an evening concert at
the Municipal Theater.
   Quayle saw none of the violence. On the 1{-hour drive back to
Santiago from the inauguration in Valparaiso, his car edged through
thousands of reveling Aylwin supporters who were waiting for their
new president to return to the capital.

   Two mild aftershocks to the Upland
earthquake shook parts of Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties
early today, but no injuries or damages were reported,
seismologists said.
   The first aftershock at 3:26 a.m. measured 3.3 on the Richter
scale, and the second, at 3:29 a.m., measured 2.8, said Robert Finn
of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. Both were
centered four miles northwest of Upland, he said.
   Upland police received about 20 telephone calls from residents
who reported feeling the aftershocks, but Lt. John Cannon said no
injuries or damages were reported.
   The Feb. 28 Upland earthquake measured 5.5 on the Richter scale
and caused nearly $13 million in damages, according to a
preliminary estimate by the state Office of Emergency Services.
   The Richter scale measures ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. An earthquake of magnitude 2 is the smallest normally
felt by humans, while a quake of magnitude 3 can cause slight
damage. A magnitude 5 quake can cause considerable damage.

   President Patricio Aylwin called for an
end to violence and hate as he took over from long-ruling Gen.
Augusto Pinochet, but street disturbances marred the celebration of
an end to military rule.
   ``Chile doesn't want more violence, it doesn't want more war,''
Aylwin declared late Sunday from the balcony of the presidential
palace after his inauguration earlier in the day.
   Thousands below cheered the end of Pinochet's 16-year rule.
   ``This infant being born, this liberty we are reconquering, we
have to take care of it,'' said the 71-year-old Aylwin. He said
that would require ``knowing how to respect one another, never
again having Chileans divided into enemies.''
   Aylwin's first official act was to pardon all political
prisoners. His government also restored diplomatic relations with
the Soviet Union, East Germany, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia and
Poland.
   Chile is the last in a series of South American countries to
restore elected civilian rule in the last decade.
   But Pinochet, 74, who seized power in a bloody 1973 coup that
toppled Marxist President Salvador Allende, plans to stay on as
commander of the powerful 60,000-man army and has rejected Aylwin's
requests he retire from the military.
   Aylwin, who won office in December with the backing of centrist
and moderate leftist groups, assumed office to thunderous cheers
and applause in a half-finished congressional building in the
seaport of Valparaiso, 70 miles northwest of Santiago.
   Beside him during the ceremony was Pinochet, his dark blue
military uniform bedecked with gold medals. The general shook
Aylwin's hand after Aylwin, a centrist Christian Democrat, slipped
on the presidential sash.
   Aylwin has vowed to restore respect for human rights and civil
liberties and put more emphasis on social services. But he plans no
major changes in Pinochet's largely successful free-market economic
program.
   A newly elected congress, dominated by foes of Pinochet, also
took power Sunday.
   Vice President Dan Quayle said Pinochet assured him he will obey
the new civilian government. Quayle, who attended the inauguration,
was jeered earlier Sunday by Pinochet supporters upon arriving for
a 35-minute meeting at the general's walled residence.
   ``Go Away!'' they shouted. ``Son of a whore!'' and ``Pinochet,
Pinochet!''
   A U.S. arms embargo placed on Chile since 1976 because of human
rights violations remains in effect. The embargo was proposed by
Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., who also was at the inauguration.
   Pinochet was forced to call elections when a proposal to extend
his rule to 1997 was rejected in a 1988 referendum. He entered the
new congress as supporters chanted his name and detractors in the
gallery shouted ``Murderer, murderer!''
   Earlier, a group of demonstrators tossed tomatoes and rocks at
Pinochet's open-topped convertible limosine. He was not injured in
the incident, which panicked horses carrying cermonially dressed
soldiers. One horse bumped hard into the car.
   After the ceremony, Aylwin returned to Santiago, the capital,
and hundreds of thousands of people lined the route into the city
to cheer as he passed in an open car.
   The celebrants waved red, white and blue Chilean flags and
chanted anti-Pinochet slogans including ``He's fallen now, he's
fallen now.'' For years, during demonstrations against military
rule, the most popular chant was ``He's going to fall.''
   As darkness approached, bands of leftist youths set up
barricades of burning trash and threw rocks and sticks at police.
   Helmeted anti-riot squads responded with water cannons and harsh
tear gas, which spread through downtown streets. The clashes
persisted for several hours before calm returned, leaving the
streets full of debris, including pulled-up street signs and
overturned police barricades.
   Several people were seen bleeding or overcome by the gas and
Santiago's central emergency hospital reported early today that 122
people were treated and four remained hospitalized with broken
bones. Police said 79 officers were injured, 10 of them seriously.
   Police were seen hauling off several youths, some of whom wore
emblems of the Communist or other leftist parties. Police sources
said ``more than 100'' demonstrators were arrested, but no exact
figure was immediately available.
   Aylwin's interior minister, Enrique Krauss, said the street
violence ``soiled the dignity, the cleanliness, of this occasion.''
Krauss spoke to reporters upon arrival at an evening ball for
Aylwin, his closest supporters and foreign dignitaries.
   Another celebration was planned this evening in Santiago's
National Stadium, long a symbol of political repression and human
rights abuse under Pinochet. Upon seizing power, the Pinochet
regime rounded up thousands of suspected dissidents in the stadium.
They were interrogated and, according to human rights groups, many
were tortured and some were executed.
   A clause in the 1980 constitution, written by Pinochet's
administration, bars any new president from replacing him as army
commander before 1998. Aylwin's term ends in 1994.

<TEXT>
   The entire Communist Party
leadership resigned today in response to opposition demands and the
leader of the longtime Soviet client state said the ruling party
must renew itself to head off crisis.
   The five-man Politburo of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary
Party voted to abolish the constitutional clause declaring the
party the leading force in society.
   It also set April 10 as the date for a special party congress to
elect a new Central Committee that, in the words of party General
Secretary Zhambyn Batmonh, should be younger and in favor of reform.
   The Politburo voted to hold early elections this year for the
new legislature, the Great People's Hural. An exact date was not
set.
   The moves were obvious concessions to protesters who crowded the
central square of the capital, Ulan Bator, on Friday to demand
change in the party's leadership and an emergency party congress.
   The demonstrations, shown on Soviet television, were evidence
that the winds of democratic change that swept through Eastern
Europe last year have reached Asia. Mongolia is a sparsely
populated nation on the Soviet-Chinese border.
   The Mongolian Democratic Union, an organization similar to the
grassroots citizens groups that have sprung up in the Soviet Union,
is demanding an end to the Communist Party's 69-year-old monopoly
on power, a mutiparty system and resignation of the premier,
Cabinet and legislature.
   It has also called for new elections and for the withdrawal of
Soviet troops.
   Two years ago, Mongolia's leaders followed the lead of Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and embarked on political and
economic reforms, but critics say it has been moving too slowly.
   Batmonh announced the Politburo decision in a speech to the
120-member Central Committee that was broadcast live. He also said
he was giving up his No. 1 job in the party, though Mongolian
officials did not rule out the possibility that those who resigned
might be re-elected.
   As chairman of the Hural's Presidium, Batmonh is also Mongolia's
head of state, and that job was not affected by today's
announcement.
   The Politburo decisions must be approved by the Central
Committee but all are expected to pass. The committee, which began
meeting after the Politburo session, will continue its meeting on
Tuesday.
   Batmonh said the party's main task ``is to build human and
democratic socialism on the soil of Mongolia. It is important to
renew our party leadership with younger people... people who are
clever and constructive and for perestroika.''
   He said the party should be the leading force in society but
should acquire that status ``by its work and not from a
constitutional article.''
   ``We also recognize the main principle of Marxism-Leninism,''
Batmonh added. ``National unity and stability are very important
for perestroika.''
   A Foreign Ministry official said the next step, after the
Central Committee approves the Politburo measures, will be
establishment of a commission to prepare for the April party
congress. Batmonh said this commission could include younger,
reform-minded members.
   One of the tasks of the new Hural, once elected, will be to
approve a new constitution. Work on the draft has already started.
One of the goals of the new constitution will be to separate the
roles of party and government.
   Batmonh said the draft for new party rules already being worked
on internally should be published and discussed widely.
   ``The Central Committee has received many letters from ordinary
workers and party organizations,'' he said. ``Some scientists sent
an open letter to the Central Committee and worked out a draft
program for party renewal.''
   He said all of these suggestions were being considered.
   ``The party is ready to have active cooperation and negotiations
with every force that is for democracy, socialism and improving the
welfare of our people,'' the Mongolian leader said. ``The Mongolian
People's Revolutionary Party will fight against forces that are
against the interests of the people and extremist organizations.''
   Batmonh also called for renewed effort to rehabilitate people
wrongly punished in past political purges.
   ``There was a bad tradition that those who criticized the
leaders of the party were punished,'' he said. He said this
tradition should be eradicated and any possibility of a cult of
personality re-emerging should be ruled out.

   Utah's biggest winter storm of the season dumped more snow
today, while Kansans cleaned up tornado damage and scores of people
in Illinois waited for floods to subside so they could return to
their homes.
   In Texas, a 13-year-old boy drowned in a rain-swollen creek and
a fisherman was rescued from the raging Llano River.
   The heavy, wet snow in Utah _ at least 10 inches at Salt Lake
International Airport _ delayed airline flights and clogged
freeways Sunday.
   More snow fell this morning along the Utah-Colorado border, with
as much as 12 more inches expected today in Utah's mountains.
   In central Kansas, at least three tornados touched down Sunday
evening in Rice County, damaging some buildings. No injuries were
reported. At least two tornadoes were spotted in south-central
Kansas, but no damage was reported.
   Flash flooding was reported after about 2 inches or rain fell in
Kansas. Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Texas, Arkansas and Kansas also
had flooding.
   In Texas, 13-year-old Paul Cooley drowned Sunday night after
falling into a creek in the southwest Denton County suburb of
Trophy Club. Authorities said the teen apparently was playing with
two other 13-year-olds when he slipped and fell into the water
about 8 p.m.
   In Llano, police and rescue workers dragged 45-year-old Billy
Carrol Ratliff to safety after he was swept into the river.
Officials said Ratliff was saved because he managed to grab and
cling onto a tree until help arrived.
   Late Sunday night, thunderstorms with winds up to 50 mph raked
central Illinois. Earlier in the day more than 200 people were
forced from their homes along the North Fork River after storms
Saturday dumped 4 inches of rain.
   Rescue workers helped about a dozen people from their homes by
boat when the river overflowed. ``People are telling me that the
water is higher than they ever remember seeing it before,'' said
Bismarck Fire Department Chaplain Jim Russell.
   Residents of Danville, Ill., were warned Sunday to boil their
water after flooding shut down pumps at a water station on Lake
Vermilion, police said.
   In Des Moines, Iowa, about 500 Iowa Power customers spent a
fifth night without power and were waiting for repair workers early
today. A spokesman said the company hoped to finish the work by
tonight.
   In Arkansas, emergency services officials spent the weekend
documenting damage from floodwaters.
   ``If the governor releases any disaster funds, we must have a
documentation of damages. It's wise to take pictures before repairs
are done,'' said Jim Burns, director of the Clark County Office of
Emergency Services.
   Strong currents on the Arkansas River just downstream from Pine
Bluff pushed three barges up against a dam. Officials from the Army
Corps of Engineers awaited a drop in the river flow so the barges
could be moved.
   Residents along the Ouachita River near Camden, Ark., braced for
a crest today of 40 feet _ 14 feet above flood level.
   ``When they say the river is going to hit 40, people around the
river know what to expect,'' said Mark Norwood, dispatcher with the
Ouachita County sheriff's office. ``They put things up and move in
with relatives.''
   The storm in Utah was the largest of the season, but not enough
to overcome a dry winter, said William Alder, meteorologist in
charge of the National Weather Service in Salt Lake City. ``One
storm doesn't do it,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   AIDS patients taking an experimental drug under
their own doctors' supervision have been dying at more than 10
times the rate of those taking the drug in clinical tests, The New
York Times reported today.
   Out of 8,000 patients taking the new drug in an expanded
distribution program, 290 have died, the newspaper said.
   But in clinical trials by the drug's manufacturer, Bristol-Myers
Squibb, only two of the 700 patients taking DDI, or dideoxyinosine,
have died, the company said.
   The Food and Drug Administration set up the expanded access
program last August after people with AIDS and their supporters
demanded the drug be made available through private doctors even
before it was fully tested.
   AIDS sufferers' groups said they were willing to risk taking the
drug _ which previously has been linked to pancreatitis _ to fight
the fatal disease.
   ``I think it's a painful way to learn the lesson, but maybe it's
the only way they'll learn that, to my mind, they did the wrong
thing,'' said Dr. Thomas C. Chalmers, associate director of the
technology assessment group at the Harvard University School of
Public Health.
   Bristol-Myers Squibb said the increased death rate needs to be
kept in context.
   ``We're dealing with a very, very sick population,'' said
Kathryn Bloom, a spokeswoman for the drug company.
   She said the company, thus far, attributes the deaths to AIDS,
not the drug, with the possible exception of five deaths from
pancreatitis. One death from pancreatitis was reported in the
clinical tests.

   A 10-foot long ivory tusk believed to be
the world's largest has been stolen from a Zairean national park, a
police source said today.
   The police official said there are no clues yet in the theft of
the tusk, which was kept in a science center at Kahuzi-Biega
National Park, near the eastern border with Rwanda.
   He spoke on condition of anonymity and declined to give other
details.
   The 10-foot-long tusk came from an elephant killed in 1943 in
the eastern Kivu province, police said.
   Elephant herds in this central African nation have been nearly
destroyed by ivory hunters, who have reduced the continent's
elephant population from 1.2 million to 600,000 in eight years.

   The city's east-west subway line reopened
this morning on a stretch of track closed since a derailment last
Wednesday killed three and injured 94.
   The reopening meant a return to routine for the 100,000
commuters a day who normally ride the Market-Frankford elevated
train that dips underground through downtown.
   Trains were as crowded as usual and many riders said they had no
qualms about taking the subway.
   ``No, I wasn't nervous; didn't even think about it,'' said
Albert Cavallero. ``The train seemed to be going a little slower,
stopping every now and then as if they were checking things out.''
   Tony Scarpa, a Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation
Authority supervisor, said the line was ``a few cars short, maybe
seven or eight'' for the morning rush hour.
   ``We're moving a little slower, a little under par, but not
much,'' said Scarpa.
   A motor under a subway car became dislodged Wednesday morning,
hitting a switch that sent half of a six-car train onto a second
set of tracks. The three cars derailed. One car split open when it
hit tunnel support beams,
   The accident was the deadliest in the system's history.
   About 30 mechanics have been inspecting cotter pins that help
hold the motors in place under the cars, SEPTA spokesman Dave
Murdock said. National Transportation Safety Board inspectors
examined 76 motors on 19 cars Friday and found 27 cotter pins
incorrectly installed.

<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle headed the U.S.
delegation to the presidential inauguration in Chile, but another
entourage member clearly was the bigger celebrity here _ Sen.
Edward Kennedy.
   From the arrival of Air Force Two on Saturday night, the
Massachusetts Democrat was unmistakably the center of attention.
   After Quayle made brief arrival remarks at the airport and
prepared to leave, the local reporters and TV crews shouted for
Kennedy to say something.
   When the senator and Quayle stood together, camera shutters
clicked nonstop.
   Kennedy proclaimed it ``extraordinary to breathe the free air of
Chile.''
   He is famous here both because of the affection the Latin people
hold for his two slain brothers _ President John F. Kennedy and
Sen. Robert Kennedy _ and also because of his advocacy of human
rights in Chile.
   Kennedy crusaded against the military dictatorship of Gen.
Augusto Pinochet, who transferred the presidency on Sunday to
Patricio Aylwin.
   Kennedy was the featured speaker Saturday night at a dinner
honoring human rights victims.
   He also met with opposition activists with whom he has
established relations over the years.
   ``One gave me his voting card. He said it was the most precious
thing he owned,'' Kennedy said during a brief morning stroll
outside his hotel where a local TV crew shadowed him.
   A round of applause erupted among the Chilean correspondents in
a press room at Aylwin's inauguration when Kennedy was shown on a
TV screen.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Not everyone was happy to see Kennedy in the nation that gave
Pinochet 43 percent approval vote in a 1988 plebiscite.
   Pro-Pinochet demonstrators who greeted Quayle's motorcade when
he visited the outgoing president on Sunday morning chanted
anti-American slogans, including, ``Go away.''
   Asked if they wanted Quayle to leave, some told a reporter they
did. But one woman interjected, ``It's not Quayle. It's Kennedy we
want to go home.''
   Kennedy's motorcade was pelted with rocks and eggs on his last
visit, in 1986. This time, the senator was afforded his own Secret
Service detail during his stay in Chile.
   Describing the difference in the country's mood on inauguration
day, a clearly pleased Kennedy observed, ``It was just smoke and
riot gear last time.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Although they were representing the United States together in
Chile, the Democratic senator couldn't resist having some political
fun with Quayle on the flight down.
   Quayle was conducting a question-and-answer session with
reporters when Kennedy burst into the cabin bearing a gift for the
vice president.
   He handed him a red New England Patriots jersey, with Quayle's
name and the number 96 on it.
   The reference to the 1996 presidential election was lost on no
one. Quayle, who does not discuss his future election plans,
laughingly took the shirt without comment.
   Kennedy was also mum when asked later if he was trying to say
that the Democrats would like Quayle to be their Republican
opponent in 1996.
   Quayle's public opinion ratings are as low as President Bush's
are high, a fact that is not lost on Democrats looking to a
post-Bush era.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   En route to Sunday's inauguration ceremony, Quayle made a
typical motorcade stop to greet unsuspecting bystanders.
   As he shook hands, he repeated, ``Democracy, democracy,'' in a
refrain praising the nation's return to democratic government after
16 years of military dictatorship.
   One man told him, ``The American people is very good. Now we
need help in the United States, economic help for help democracy.''
   Quayle promised he would discuss such matters with Aylwin today.
   But Chile's post-election polarization was again evident as the
U.S. entourage departed.
   ``Viva Pinochet,'' one woman in a car yelled to reporters racing
by.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   A bit of anti-American sentiment apparently isn't much of a
challenge for Quayle.
   Asked how he felt about the 400 pro-Pinochet demonstrators that
jeered him, he said blithely, ``I've had worse.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Quayle often stops to buy gifts for his children on his foreign
trips.
   A stop in a curio shop in Valparaiso resulted in a purchase,
however, that was anything but PG-rated.
   He picked up a small wooden doll that looked like a simple
native icon until its head was pulled. Then it became anatomically
correct.
   Quayle laughed with surprise, turned his back to the watching
cameras and asked the shopkeeper what it cost.
   `I can take this home,'' he joked, calling to his unsuspecting
wife, standing nearby: ``Marilyn!''
   ``Dan, you're not buying that!'' she shrieked.
   When he laughed, she exclaimed, ``You're sick.''
   Not to be dissuaded, the vice president sent an aide in for the
$4 purchase.

   A Navy Trident II test missile was fired from
a submerged submarine on a demonstration and shakedown cruise off
the coast of Florida, the Pentagon announced today.
   The announcement said the fleet ballistic missile was launched
Sunday night from the USS Pennsylvania, the second Ohio class
nuclear-powered submarine built specifically to carry the missile.
   It was the 30th flight of the missile since January 1987, and
was the second to be launched during a demonstration and shakedown
operation, designed to test the ability of the crew to handle,
maintain and operate the weapons system.
   After completion of such a launch, the submarine is then
certified for deployment, the Pentagon said.
   The announcement said additional underwater launches of Trident
II test missiles are planned in the months ahead.

   Bad weather will keep Atlantis grounded
here another day, delaying the shuttle's piggyback ride back to
Florida atop a Boeing 747, NASA officials said today.
   Overcast skies in Texas prevented the aircraft from taking off
today from Biggs Army Airfield, where it landed Sunday for
refueling, NASA spokesman Dick Young said.
   The modified jet, which is carrying the shuttle, had taken off
earlier in the day from Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. But
thunderstorms and showers across the South forced the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration to keep the plane on the
ground overnight.
   One more refueling will be needed before reaching Kennedy Space
Center. That site will be chosen depending on the weather, Young
said.
   Atlantis touched down at Edwards on March 4, completing a secret
four-day military mission that included the release of a $500
million spy satellite capable of taking super-sharp photographs and
eavesdropping on communications.
   The next shuttle flight is scheduled for April 12, when
Discovery is to begin a five-day mission to deploy the $1.55
billion Hubble Space Telescope.
   Atlantis' next flight in space is another Pentagon mission, set
for July 9.

   The first of nearly 50,000 Soviet
troops stationed in Hungary left for home today, two days after
Moscow and Budapest signed an agreement on the total withdrawal of
Red Army soldiers by mid-1991.
   The withdrawal began near the town of Hajmasker, about 75 miles
southwest of Budapest, with the pullout of a battalion comprised of
300 soldiers and 40 armored personnel carriers.
   Hungary on Saturday became the second Warsaw Pact country to
negotiate a full Soviet withdrawal from its territory.
   Last month, Prague and Moscow agreed that the Kremlin would
bring home all of its 73,500 Soviet troops stationed in
Czechoslovakia. The pullout there began Feb. 26.
   The withdrawals from both countries are due to be completed by
June 30, 1991 and a total of 123,200 Soviet troops are scheduled to
be removed.
   Both agreements are independent of any accord reached at
East-West troop reduction talks under way in Vienna.
   The agreement on the pullout from Hungary was signed in Moscow
Saturday by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and his
Hungarian counterpart Gyula Horn, who traveled to the Soviet
capital for the official signing.
   The Soviet Union currently has 49,700 troops stationed in
Hungary, as well as 27,146 military vehicles, including 860 tanks
and 1,500 armoured personnel carriers. It also has six airports in
Hungary, according to deputy Chief of Staff Jozsef Biro, who
released details of the Soviet presence for the first time two
weeks ago.
   Hungarian radio reported Saturday that the two governments were
still negotiating on the property being left behind by the Soviet
troops.
   According to the report, two-thirds of the withdrawal of Soviet
troops and equipment is to be completed by the end of this year.
   The start of the withdrawal comes barely two weeks before
Hungarians go to the polls March 25 for their first free multiparty
elections since the Communists consolidated power in 1948.
   Some opposition members have suggested the new government might
seek to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement with Moscow to move up
the completion date.

   Oliver North testified today that he had
general instructions from John Poindexter to conceal his activities
aiding the Contras from members of the House intelligence committee.
   North's second day of testimony at Poindexter's trial brought
rebukes from the judge, who complained that ``it's like pulling
teeth'' to get North to answer fully questions from the prosecution.
   Prosecutor Dan Webb hammered away at North's assertion Friday
that ``nobody told me to lie'' at an Aug. 6, 1986, meeting with
members of Congress in the White House Situation Room.
   Had North been ``generally instructed'' by Poindexter ``to
conceal facts from Congress?'' asked Webb.
   ``Yes, conceal or withhold,'' replied North, adding that he had
been directed to keep such matters secret from foreign governments
and others.
   ``From Congress?'' North was asked.
   ``Yes, it's inclusive in that,'' North replied after Webb
confronted the former White House aide with testimony he gave to
Congress on July 8, 1987, in which he acknowledged getting the
instructions.
   ``It's like pulling teeth'' to get North to answer Webb's
questions, U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene said as North
resumed testifying.
   Greene twice rebuked North, telling him at one point, ``Let's
try to stick to the facts.''
   ``Yes, your honor,'' North replied.
   At another point the judge complained to North that he
``quibbles'' with the prosecutor's characterizations at certain
times while ``you embroider at others.''
   Poindexter is accused of obstructing Congress by allegedly
concealing North's Contra activities. He also is accused of
conspiracy, another count of obstruction and two counts of making
false statements in connection with a November 1985 shipment of
Hawk anti-aircraft missiles to Iran.
   Webb had said Friday he would open today's questioning of North
by focusing on the missile shipment.
   But the prosecutor returned to the Aug. 6, 1986, meeting on the
Contras. North had testified that he resisted going to that
meeting, but that Poindexter directed him to go anyway. However,
North on Friday said neither Poindexter nor anyone else directed
him to lie at the meeting.
   Before North's testimony resumed, Webb asked for permission to
elicit testimony about North's three felony convictions in the
Iran-Contra affair. He was convicted of aiding and abetting an
obstruction of Congress, destroying documents relating to his
Contra activities and accepting an illegal gratuity. The judge said
he would rule on the question later today.
   Regarding the Hawk missiles, North kept Poindexter, his boss on
the National Security Council staff, informed of the missile
shipment at the time it occurred. Poindexter, however, told the
House and Senate intelligence committees on Nov. 21, 1986, that he
did not learn of the delivery until more than a month after it was
completed.
   Poindexter says he gave incorrect information to the committees
because he had simply forgotten a year later that he knew of the
shipment beforehand.
   Iran-Contra prosecutors are unfairly bringing charges against
Poindexter for ``a five-week mistake,'' defense attorney Richard
Beckler said in opening arguments last week.
   The CIA-assisted delivery was authorized retroactively by a
presidential document that Poindexter destroyed the same day he
made his incorrect statements to the intelligence committees.
   The politically embarrassing document, known as a ``finding,''
depicted the U.S. government as being involved in a straight
arms-for-hostages deal with Iran.
   North testified at his own trial last year that he watched
Poindexter destroy the paper.
   ``I saw the finding torn up,'' North said then. ``I saw him tear
it in two.''
   The government alleges the existence of the document was
Poindexter's motive for concealing from Congress U.S. involvement
in the November 1985 missile.
   But at a pretrial hearing in Poindexter's case last December,
North said he understood the destroyed document was the finding
only after watching Poindexter testify about it in nationally
televised congressional hearings.
   U.S. District Judge Harold Greene said North was
``prevaricating'' at the December hearing in an attempt avoid
having to testify against his ex-boss.
   Poindexter was granted conditional immunity by Congress for his
testimony, and no part of a prosecution may be derived from the
immunized testimony of a defendant.
   Greene, however, said North's testimony at the December hearing
was not believable and that prosecutors would be allowed to elicit
North's testimony on the destruction of the document.
   On Friday, North reluctantly testified that Poindexter directed
him ``to take care of'' congressional inquiries about whether he
was assisting the Nicaraguan Contra rebels militarily.
   But North insisted that he himself made the decision to lie when
he met with the congressmen and that neither Poindexter nor anyone
else ordered him to do so.

Presidency</HEAD>

   A divided Soviet Congress today debated the
powerful presidency championed by Mikhail S. Gorbachev as essential
for democracy, and the proposal faced possible rejection for lack
of the required two-thirds majority.
   But one progressive deputy who has fought placing so much power
in the hands of one man said he would have to cave in if Gorbachev
were to stake his own leadership on the issue.
   And Gorbachev's vice president argued that the proposal for a
new presidency ``rules out personal dictatorship.''
   The session fell behind schedule and closed for the day without
a vote on the presidency, despite Gorbachev's urgings to keep to a
tight schedule.
   The divisions in the 2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies
reflected the turmoil in Soviet politics as Gorbachev begins his
sixth year as Soviet leader.
   The president and Communist Party chief told the 2,087 deputies
present that they would be asked to amend the constitution to
revoke the party's monopoly on power, create a new presidency and,
if the presidency proposal is adopted, to elect the new president.
   ``We find ourselves in a paralysis of power,'' said Sergei
Alexeyev, chairman of the congress' Constitutional Committee, who
took the floor in support of Gorbachev. ``The presidency is the
only way to transfer the real power from the party to the
government.''
   If the presidency issue is resolved positively, ``we can get
down to drafting a new constitution immediately which will confirm
human rights, democracy and conversion to a market economy,'' he
said.
   The president will have the power to veto laws, appoint a
Cabinet, declare a state of emergency and presidential rule.
Opponents say that concentrates too much power in the hands of one
person.
   Progressive Moscow parliamentarian Alexei Yablokov predicted a
boycott of the vote on the presidency by many of the deputies from
Georgia, Moldavia, Azerbaijan, Estonia and Latvia.
   On Friday, Georgia's parliament denounced the office as
``authoritarian presidential rule.''
   Before the session began, progressive parliamentarian Sergei
Stankevich said he expected about a third of the deputies to
abstain from voting on the expanded presidency.
   Estonian deputy Igor Griazin said the Estonian delegation would
abstain because prticipating in the creation of the presidency
``can be interpreted as an indirect acknowledgement of Moscow's
rule.''
   Estonia, although it has not gone as far as Lithuania, has moved
to distance itself from the Kremlin. Lithuania declared itself
independent on Sunday.
   As the congress session opened today Gorbachev, noting the
absence of the chairman of the Lithuanian delegation, said, ``The
information coming from Lithuania is alarming, and momentous
decisions are being made there that will affect both Lithuania and
the Soviet Union.''
   Most of the Lithuanian seats at the Congress in the Kremlin were
vacant.
   Gorbachev gave no indication he would seek to prevent
Lithuania's secession, although he has opposed it.
   Stankevich said Gorbachev could turn the presidency issue into a
vote of confidence in his own stewardship. If the Soviet leader
threatened to resign, Stankevich said, then the deputies will give
him what he wants.
   The legislator, who strongly objects to the specific powers
given to the president in the draft, said that if Gorbachev
threatened to resign, he would throw his support behind him. ``I
will vote for Gorbachev,'' Stankevich said.
   Gorbachev has said the new presidency is necessary to ensure
that his campaign for democratization and domestic reform do not
fail. His view was overwhelmingly endorsed on Feb. 27 by the
country's smaller working legislature, the Supreme Soviet, which is
elected by the Congress from among its own membership.
   Vice President Anatoly I. Lukyanov, in his speech to the
Congress on today, stressed the limits that would be placed on the
new president.
   He said the president would be subject to recall by the Congress
and that the proposal would for the first time establish a clear
balance of power between the legislative and executive branches of
government.
   Gorbachev, in his present post, holds executive authority while
also presiding over the Congress of People's Deputies and the
Supreme Soviet.
   Lukyanov also pointed out a presidential veto could be
overridden by a two-thirds majority of both houses of the Supreme
Soviet legislature, which is similar to the U.S. president's veto
power. And while the Soviet president would have power to declare
war, Lukyanov said the president would be required to ``immediately
solicit the determination of the Supreme Soviet.''
   The new office must be created by a constitutional amendment,
which requires a two-thirds majority of all deputies _ not just
those voting.
   A boycott by a substantial number of deputies, therefore, could
torpedo the proposal.
   Members of the Inter-regional Group, a parliamentary opposition
of some 400 Congress members, planned either to vote against the
proposed constitutional amendments establishing the presidency or
abstain, group leader Gavriil Popov told a news conference Sunday.
   Inter-regional Group members say their constituents want the
right to directly elect the president from the start.
   However, Popov said the opposition deputies would not field a
candidate to oppose Gorbachev.

   A 19-year-old tennis pro charged
with his brother in the shotgun slayings of their millionaire
parents returned home from a tournament in Israel and surrendered
to police waiting at the airport.
   Erik Menendez, 19, was arrested early Sunday after arranging the
surrender through his attorney, said police Lt. Bob Curtis.
Menendez was booked for investigation of murder and jailed without
bail.
   His brother, 22-year-old Lyle Menendez, was arrested Thursday.
He was held without bail for arraignment today.
   Curtis said he did not know when Erik Menendez would be
arraigned.
   The brothers were charge with two counts of homicide each in the
slayings of their parents, Jose Menendez, 45, and Mary Louise
``Kitty'' Menendez, 44.
   The couple were shot to death Aug. 20 in their $5 million
Beverly Hills mansion. The sons reported finding the bodies upon
returning from a night on the town.
   The young men are heirs to the $14 million estate of Jose
Menendez, an executive of Live Entertainment Inc., a video
distribution company.
   Erik, who decided on a tennis career after his parents' deaths,
had been playing in a tournament when he received word of his
brother's arrest.
   Police have said two killers committed the crime, then picked up
shell casings from the .12-gauge shotguns they used before fleeing.
   The Los Angeles Times reported Saturday that a friend found a
.12-gauge casing in one of Lyle's jackets. It was held as evidence.
   Police who served search warrants at a psychologist's office
Thursday also obtained tape recordings, apparently of counseling
sessions involving the sons, which are likely to be the subject of
a court hearing on their admissibility.

   Teachers across West Virginia today
heeded their union's refusal to call off a growing strike despite a
warning from the governor that those who didn't come back could
lose their jobs.
   A proposed settlement of the state's first teacher walkout
collapsed over the weekend. The largest teachers union says West
Virginia has the second-lowest teachers' salaries in the nation.
   The strike over pay began Wednesday and by today had spread to
46 of the state's 55 counties. Classes were canceled in at least 27
counties for more than 150,000 pupils, about half the state's
enrollment.
   In Ohio County, classes had to be canceled when officials found
most of the district's 47 school buses had flat tires,
Superintendent H. Lawrence Jones said. It was unclear who was
responsible, he added.
   Leaders of the 16,000-member West Virginia Education Association
recommended continuing the strike until Gov. Gaston Caperton
promises to call a special legislative session to consider pay
raises. But Caperton said he won't consider calling a special
session until the teachers go back to work.
   Last week, Attorney General Roger Tompkins declared the strike
illegal and said any teachers who walk off the job can be
suspended, fired, barred from teaching for a year and charged with
misdemeanors.
   After the proposed settlement collapsed, Caperton said he would
ask county superintendents to begin disciplinary action against any
teachers who continue to strike.
   State School Superintendent Hank Marockie met on Sunday with the
55 county superintendents but said he would wait to see how many
teachers returned today before deciding what action to recommend.
   Teachers are employed by county school boards, and it is up to
county school superintendents to take any action against striking
teachers, including suspension or firing.
   ``County superintendents will follow those rules and make it
strict and the consequences are pretty bad,'' Caperton said. ``It's
very clear by law what they're to do. I've asked them to do that.''
   Association members voted overwhelmingly Saturday to go back to
work for 30 days if Caperton called a special legislative session.
But Association President Kayetta Meadows accused the governor of
reneging on a promise to call a special session, and she said late
Saturday, ``We have no choice but to continue a statewide strike.''
   Caperton termed Meadows' accusation ``a total lie'' _ but he did
not rule out calling a special session.
   ``We did not commit ourselves or close the door to a special
session,'' Caperton spokesman G.C. Morse said. ``This is
ludicrous.''
   Leaders of the other main striking union, the 3,000-member West
Virginia Federation of Teachers, recommended an end to the strike
but said the decision was up to teachers in each county.
   Another 3,000 teachers are not represented by either union.
   The association's former president, Tom Vogel, late Sunday urged
striking members to ignore Meadows and return to work today.
   ``The governor assured me he will begin talking immediately upon
the return of teachers to the classroom,'' said Vogel, who did not
run for re-election in 1988 and was replaced by Meadows.
   ``We have stood proud and tall and we have made our point, but
now is the time to solve the problems and the only way we really
can is by working directly with the governor and the Legislature.''
   Saturday's aborted settlement was the second in a week. Last
Monday, the governor and legislative leaders offered teachers a 5
percent raise but withdrew the proposal 14 hours later, saying the
association's refusal to lift its strike threat ruined any chance
of passage in the Legislature.
   The association says the average West Virginia teacher salary of
$21,904 ranks the state 49th in the nation. That figure does not
include a 5 percent raise teachers received in February. Teachers
objected when the governor provided no money in his 1990-91 budget
for an additional raise.

   The Bush administration today expressed
support anew for Lithuania's move toward independence, but said it
will delay formal recognition of the breakaway republic until the
Lithuanians are ``in control of their own destiny.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater reiterated the
administration's call upon the Soviet central government to
``respect the will of the citizens'' of the Baltic state.
   But the administration stopped short of recognizing the
government formed by a unanimous vote Sunday of the new Lithuanian
parliament in Vilnius.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, opening a congress of
communist party deputies today in Moscow, called Lithuania's
declaration of independence ``alarming'' but gave no indication he
plans any action to prevent the Baltic republic from seceding.
   Gorbachev has said previously that Lithuania would have to pay
the Kremlin $34 billion for the factories and other infrastructure
built during a half-century of Soviet rule. Lithuanians say they
are owed even more for decades of Soviet repression _ including
mass deportations to Siberia under Stalin.
   Fitzwater, asked at a briefing why the United States did not
immediately recognize the new Lithuanian government, said,
``Because we would want any recognition to take into account a
final government that was in control of their own destiny, and much
of that has yet to be negotiated with the Soviet Union.''
   He emphasized the United States has never recognized the Soviet
Union's forcible annexation in 1940 of Lithuania and its two sister
Baltic republics, Estonia and Latvia. He said the United States
wants ``to foster productive negotiations.''
   ``We believe this is the right measure of support,'' Fitzwater
said. ``It reflects our policy of many years of not recognizing
their incorporation in the first place. It reflects the fact that
they still have negotiations to carry out that we want to be
successful.''
   The White House, in a statement Sunday by Fitzwater, urged
Gorbachev to enter ``immediate constructive negotiations'' with the
Lithuanians, and said, ``We have consistently supported the Baltic
peoples' inalienable right to peaceful self-determination.''
   It urged ``the Soviet government to respect the will of the
citizens of Lithuania as expressed through their freely elected
representatives.''
   The United States also ``expects the government of Lithuania to
consider the rights of its minority population,'' he said.
   ``We hope that all parties will continue to avoid any initiation
or encouragement of violence,'' Fitzwater said.
   A Lithuanian diplomat in Washington said Western governments are
likely to wait to recognize Lithuania's declaration of independence
until its leaders resolve disputes with Moscow and establish
control over their country.
   Stasys Lozoraitis, charge d'affaires for Lithuania, said U.S.
officials had told him beforehand ``they want to see the government
take over effective control'' before formally recognizing it.
   ``All Western powers are inclined to wait,'' the Lithuanian
diplomat said. But he predicted recognition could come ``after one
month or two.''
   The United States and other Western nations have never
recognized the Soviet Union's forcible annexation of Lithuania and
its Baltic neighbors while under Red Army occupation. The three
states, once part of czarist Russia, had gained independence after
World War I.
   In 1940, a year after the infamous non-aggression pact between
Stalin's Soviet Union and Hitler's Germany, the Soviet Army imposed
regimes that rubberstamped the three republics' incorporation into
the Soviet Union.
   The Baltic states were overrun by Hitler's Nazi troops and
subject to terror and death camps, and terrorized again by Stalin's
secret police after the Red Army recaptured the lands. More than 1
million people perished in the Baltic States during World War II.
   Fitzwater, in a written statement, said: ``The United States
believes it is in the mutual interest of Lithuania, the Soviet
Union and all CSCE countries to resolve this issue peacefully. We
call upon the Soviet government to address its concerns and
interests through immediate constructive negotiations with the
government of Lithuania.''
   The CSCE is the 3-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation
in Europe, also known as the Helsinki process. It includes all the
nations of Europe except Albania, and also the United States and
Canada.
   The Helsinki process, which produced pan-European agreements on
arms control and human rights in 1975, is now regarded as a way to
help shape the new Europe in the wake of the dramatic shifts toward
democracy across the East Bloc.

   Text of the Lithuanian Supreme Council's
declaration of independence, approved Sunday by a vote of 124-0
with six abstentions. The English-language translation was obtained
from the Sajudis political movement.
   
   The Supreme Council of the Republic of Lithuania, expressing the
will of the nation, resolves and solemnly proclaims that the
execution of the sovereign power of the Lithuanian state,
heretofore constrained by alien forces in 1940, is restored, and
henceforth Lithuania is once again an independent state.
   The February 16, 1918 Act of Independence of the Supreme Council
of Lithuania and the May 15, 1920 Constituent Assembly Resolution
on the restoration of a democratic Lithuanian state have never lost
their legal force and are the constitutional foundation of the
Lithuanian state.
   The territory of Lithuania is integral and indivisible, and the
constitution of any other State has no jurisdiction within it.
   The Lithuanian state emphasizes its adherence to universally
recognized principles of international law, recognizes the
principles of the inviolability of borders as formulated in
Helsinki in 1975 in the Final Act of the Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe, and guarantees rights of individuals,
citizens and ethnic communities.
   The Supreme Council of the Republic of Lithuania, expressing
sovereign power, by this act begins to achieve the State's full
sovereignty.

   A man who walked into a church, shot his
estranged wife and killed himself had been arrested for violating a
judge's order to stay away from her, authorities say.
   About 50 people were at the Byng Free Will Baptist Church on
Sunday when David Leon Lynch, 31, shot Tawanna Jo Lynch, 32, twice
in the head before shooting himself, Pontotoc County sheriff's
Deputy John Christian said.
   Mrs. Lynch was taken to St. Anthony's Hospital in Oklahoma City,
where she was in critical condition today, a hospital spokeswoman
said. She was scheduled to undergo surgery later in the day.
   Lynch, who was pronounced dead at the church, entered the
building by a side door, walked across the back and up the side
aisle and spoke to his wife, Christian said.
   Witnesses told investigators Lynch said something like, ``I told
you I was going to get you,'' before shooting his wife,
Undersheriff Jeff Glase said.
   The couple, who have two children, recently filed for divorce
and had been separated for about a month, Christian said.
   He said Mrs. Lynch had received a temporary protective order,
and that Lynch was arrested Feb. 22 for violating the order.
   Christian also said Lynch had a long criminal record, with
convictions of knowingly concealing stolen property, intimidating a
witness, assault and public drunkenness.

   The Labor Party today blamed Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc for undermining peace
efforts and authorized party leaders to bring down the coalition
government.
   In a nationally broadcast speech, Labor leader Shimon Peres told
the 1,300 members of the center-left party's Central Committee that
Shamir was stalling and would not respond to U.S. peace proposals.
   ``We have reached a conclusion that Shamir will try to run a
policy of saying neither yes or no. He will try to avoid the
decision and will pull us into the desert of indecision,'' said
Peres, who is finance minister and vice premier.
   On Sunday, Shamir refused to allow the 12-member Inner Cabinet
to vote on a U.S.-backed peace plan, which aims to set up
preliminary peace talks between Palestinian and Israeli delegations
in Cairo.
   The Labor members today approved a vaguely worded resolution,
with only one member dissenting. The resolution authorized the
party leadership and the 39 Labor members in the 120-seat
parliament to ``determine the parliamentary moves necessitated by
the situation.''
   That gave Peres a mandate to join with other, smaller parties to
support a no-confidence motion expected to be brought before
Parliament Thursday, unless a compromise can be worked out in the
meantime.
   A no-confidence vote would bring down the 15-month-old
government.
   Before the Labor announcement, Religion Minister Zevulun Hammer
met separately with Israel's four top political leaders _ Shamir,
Peres, Foreign Minister Moshe Arens of Likud and Defense Minister
Yitzhak Rabin of Labor _ to try to mediate a compromise, Israel
radio said.
   But Shamir aide Avi Pazner said there seemed little room left
for agreement.
   ``It looks like the two parties are going for a showdown
Thursday. It would take a miracle to reach a compromise before
that,'' he said.
   Israeli newspapers said Shamir was considering firing the Labor
Cabinet ministers to prevent them from becoming part of a
transitional government, which would be set up if parliament gave
the government a no-confidence vote.
   The Labor Party would then be in a weaker position if national
elections are called, the English-language Jerusalem Post said. It
would also put the transitional government entirely under Shamir.
   Labor has backed the proposals put forward by U.S. Secretary of
State James A. Baker III to begin preliminary peace talks.
   Shamir and his Likud bloc have resisted the Baker plan, saying
his call for participation in the talks by residents of Arab east
Jerusalem could threaten Israel's declared sovereignty over the
area.
   They also oppose allow deportees from the territories to
participate, saying this could provide a back-door entry to the PLO.
   Israel considers the Palestine Liberation Organization a
terrorist organization and refuses to deal with it.
   Also today, Israeli troops shot and killed a Palestinian youth,
Jemal Muhammed Haleefa, 17, during a stone-throwing clash in the
Ahbat Jaber refugee camp in Jericho, Arab hospital officials said.
   The army confirmed the death and said soldiers opened fired when
attacked by a group of masked youths.
   Haleefa's death raised to 653 the number of Palestinians killed
by Israelis during the 27-month revolt against Israeli rule of the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Another 195 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs, most
on suspicion of collaborating with Israel, and 43 Israelis have
died in the violence.

<HEAD>Surrealist Writer Philippe Soupault Dead at 92</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Writer and poet Philippe Soupault, one of the
founders of the surrealist movement, has died at the age of 92.
   Soupault died Sunday night in his Paris home. No cause of death
was announced.
   ``The Magnetic Fields,'' a poem Soupault wrote with Andre
Breton, was first published in 1919 and is considered the work that
gave birth to the surrealist movement.
   Born in the exclusive Paris suburb of Chaville and educated at
the Sorbonne, Soupault was influenced by the works of Marcel Proust
and his voyages to Germany and England.
   But the horrors of World War I proved a stronger influence, and
in March 1919 he joined Breton and Louis Aragon to found the review
``Literature.''
   The magazine quickly became the standard-bearer for
intellectuals disillusioned with the bourgeois culture they
believed caused the war.
   The journal published Soupault's poem ``Westwego'' and other
works, but he eventually fell out with Breton and the surrealist
movement, accusing it of having become politicized.
   Soupault continued to write poetry and novels including ``The
Negro.'' He turned to journalism in the 1930s, reporting for the
Petit Parisien newspaper and founding Radio Tunis in 1938.
   He married Renee Niemeyer in 1937. They had two daughters.
   After World War II, Soupault directed the overseas broadcasts of
Radio Television Francaise and continued to work in broadcasting
into the 1970s.
   He continued writing poetry, including ``Day and Night Song''
and ``Without Sentences,'' brought together in the ``Poems and
Poetry'' collection in 1973. His last published work was ``Memoires
of the Forgotten'' in 1981.

<HEAD>South Korean Foreign Minister Has `High Hopes' of China Relations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korea's foreign minister stopped briefly in
Beijing on Monday and expressed ``high hope'' the two countries
would soon agree to diplomatic relations.
   Foreign Minister Choi Ho-joong did not meet any Chinese
officials, but conferred with U.S. Ambassador James Lilley and
Pakistan Ambassador M. Akram Zaki during his hour-long stay at
Beijing airport.
   He left Tokyo aboard a commercial flight earlier Monday for an
11-day trip that will take him to Pakistan, India, Czechoslovakia,
Bulgaria and Yugoslavia.
   In Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria, Choi is to sign protocols
establishing normal diplomatic relations with those countries.
   Choi said he was carrying no messages for Chinese officials and
that his only objective during the stopover was to meet his ``old
friend'' Lilley, who formerly served as U.S. envoy to Seoul.
   ``We can exchange views'' on China, he said, but there will be
``no formal proposals.``
   ``We always have high hope'' of normalizing relations with
China, he said. ``I don't know how soon it can be realized (but)
I've already offered to meet with the foreign minister when the
situation is right.''
   Choi is likely to meet one key Chinese official during his trip:
Deng Pufang, the son of senior leader Deng Xiaoping, was on the
same flight to Pakistan for a visit in his capacity as head of the
China Federation of Handicapped People.
   Lilley, asked if the United States could serve as a go-between
in bringing about relations between China and South Korea, said:
``No, we're not in the best position to do that.'' U.S. relations
with China are badly strained by Washington's criticisms of
Beijing's human rights record and its suppression of political
dissent.
   Choi's predecessor, Choi Kwang-soo, also stopped at Beijing
airport in August 1988 for a meeting with former U.S. Ambassador
Winston Lord. Then, too, there were no contacts with Chinese
officials.
   Trade between China and South Korea has grown to more than $3
billion a year, but China remains politically tied to South Korea's
bitter rivals, the Communist government in North Korea.
   Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin is leaving
for North Korea this week on his first foreign trip, and the North
Koreans are certain to seek reassurances that Beijing is not
leaning toward more ties with Seoul.
   Choi said he was ``very happy'' to visit East Europe and
formalize relations with the two socialist states there.
   ``Our private sectors are very much enthusiastic to promote
economic exchange and cooperation,'' he said. ``I think the
establishment of relations will create a very good atmosphere for
businessmen to move into those countries.''
   South Korea already has diplomatic relations with Hungary,
Poland and Yugoslavia and plans to start normalization talks soon
with Romania and East Germany.
   The anti-Communist government in Seoul has also increased
contacts with the Soviet Union, and Choi said he would ask Pakistan
and India to act as go-betweens in helping South Korea establish
formal ties with Moscow and Beijing.

<HEAD>Party Leaders Suggest Stronger Ties with Masses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party Central Committee called
today for the party to strengthen ties with the people, many of
whom became disillusioned with the Communists after last year's
crackdown on the student pro-democracy movement.
   The Central Committee concluded a four-day meeting, the first
since November, when it approved a three-year economic austerity
program and announced senior leader Deng Xiaoping was resigning
from his last party post. News of the semiannual meeting was
carried by the official Xinhua News Agency.
   The party has been concerned about popular unrest because of the
economic downturn and the harsh political climate following the
military repression of dissent last June that left hundreds,
perhaps thousands, dead.
   As a result, the party was expected to ease some austerity
measures, such as loosening credit to money-starved industries. But
any decisions probably will not be announced until the National
People's Congress _ China's rubber-stamp legislature _ convenes
next week.
   Instead, the Central Committee issued a communique saying the
party's ties to the masses are its ``fundamental working line and
also its fine tradition and political asset,'' according to Xinhua.
   It acknowledged that people have become disenchanted with the
party because of its ``bureaucracy, subjectivism, formalism,
passivism, (and) corruption.''
   The communique did not specifically say how ties might be
strengthened. But in recent days, the official media have reported
the arrests of several officials on corruption charges in an
attempt to show the party will not tolerate such activities.
   The Chinese also have become disillusioned with the party's
economic policies, which have led to runaway inflation, the closure
of thousands of factories and layoffs of millions of workers.
   But the document said China was on the right track with its
economic reform and called on ``all party members ... to follow
firmly and in an all-around way the basic line of taking economic
construction as the central task.''

<HEAD>A Loss of Place: Japan's Rush Hour Trains Without Seats</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese commuters long accustomed to the crush of
humanity and shoves and sneezes of fellow passengers began
suffering another indignity Monday: rush hour trains without seats.
   The Yamanote line, one of Tokyo's most heavily traveled routes,
introduced new cars with seats that can be lowered or folded back
into the wall at the touch of a button.
   The seats will stay folded to ease crowding until the end of the
morning rush hour at 10 a.m., creating what one Japanese TV
announcer called a ``freight-train feeling'' aboard the cars.
   ``We're being treated like baggage,'' complained a middle-age
man riding one of the four new cars, introduced on just two trains
as an experiment.
   But another woman said the standing-room-only cars ``looked
neater and less-crowded'' than regular trains, which sometimes are
so packed that riders have only enough space to place one foot on
the floor, and can let go of a bag without it falling to the ground.
   ``It's an attempt to ease the overcrowding. We'll see what the
reaction is, and then make a decision on whether to expand their
use,'' a railroad official said.
   Train officials say there are very few ways left to ease the
crush of the growing crowds that press their way _ sometimes with
the aid of train employees who push from behind _ onto Tokyo's
rush-hour trains.
   Of the 32 million people who live in and around the capital,
about half reportedly use mass transit for commuting. An estimated
5 million people each day ride the Yamanote line, which loops
around central Tokyo, the railway official said.
   During rush hour, many lines in the city are at full capacity,
meaning that no more trains can be squeezed into the schedule.
   On the Yamanote line, 10-car trains run every 2{ minutes during
rush hour, while trains on slower-moving subway lines arrive every
two minutes.
   An attempt two years ago to revise safety rules to narrow the
gap between trains on the Sobu line was abandoned after one train
slammed into another at a station, killing two people.
   ``We can't run any more trains because we've reached the maximum
capacity,'' said the railroad official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``All we can do is try to ease the current situation.''
   The new cars have six doors on each side, compared with the
normal four, to allow passengers on and off trains more easily.
They officially are supposed to carry a maximumb 162 people _ 18
more than the regular cars. During rush hour, however, many more
people jam into the cars.
   ``I usually can't sit down anyway, so I think the new
arrangement is good,'' said one young woman. A male rider expressed
concern about older people who are unable to sit on the new trains.
   ``Our hope is to improve service for the largest number of
passengers,'' another railway official said. ``We hope the public
will understand.''
   The Japan Broadcasting Corp. timed passengers getting on and off
trains at a station Monday and found that the new design was about
10 seconds faster.
   But despite the seatless design, at least one of the new cars
was so crowded Monday that train employees had to resort to the old
technique of pushing passengers into the doors to allow the train
to depart on time.

   Arab and Jewish women danced while
holding olive branches, and served matzo ball soup and baklava at a
social gathering to promote peace in the Middle East.
   About 250 people attended ``Ballads, Bagels and Baklava,'' a
five-hour dinner dance Sunday night sponsored by the 2-year-old
group Tacoma Arabs, Jews and Others for Peace.
   The years of strife over a Palestinian homeland was ``on
everybody's faces, in spite of all the good times'' at the
festivities, said Patsy Kempthorne, a member of Temple Beth El.
   Arabs at the event said Israel should give up the West Bank and
Gaza Strip; Jews said Israel must be assured that Palestinians will
not threaten that country's security.

   More than 400 bird-watchers turned up at the
crack of dawn at a sewage plant to get a glimpse of an apparently
disoriented arctic bird rarely seen south of Canada, a Ross's gull.
   ``I woke up at 4:15 to come out here,'' said George Armistead,
16, of Philadelphia. ``I never thought I'd see the day when a
Ross's gull would land so close I could make the drive in a little
over two hours.''
   At 8:35 a.m. Sunday, someone finally spotted the gull in flight.
It eventually settled down to preen for a half-hour near a creek
behind the Back River treatment plant in suburban Baltimore.
   ``What makes this Ross's gull so unique is that every other past
record has been a one-day wonder,'' said birdwatcher Rick Blom.
``This Ross's gull has already been in Baltimore for more than a
week.''
   Blom said the gull is a long-distance migrator that has a
tendency to get blown off course.
   The first confirmed U.S. sighting of a Ross's gull was believed
to have been in 1975 in Salisbury Beach, Mass. Unconfirmed
sightings have been reported as far afield as Tennessee and
Colorado.

<TEXT>
   Poland has sent military officers to
observe annual joint military exercises involving U.S. and South
Korean troops for the first time since the Korean War ended in
1953, officials said Monday.
   Defense Ministry officials said two Polish army colonels would
observe landing operations this week by U.S. troops before the
full-scale ``Team Spirit'' field exercises across South Korea.
   Ministry officials said more than 20 military attaches in South
Korea and Japan have been invited to observe the exercises, which
will last for about two weeks and involve fewer than 200,000 U.S.
and South Korean soldiers.
   Poland has military attaches in North Korea as a member of the
U.N.-dispatched, four-nation commission overseeing the armistice
agreement that ended the Korean War. The other nations are
Czechoslovakia, Switzerland and Sweden.
   Of the four nations charged with overseeing implementation of
the armistice agreement, officials said Poland and Switzerland had
accepted invitations.
   It was the first time any socialist country has dispatched
military observers to the exercises, which began in 1976.
   There has been no response from China or other Communist
countries invited to observe what U.S. and South Korean officials
termed the defensive exercise.
   As in the past, North Korea rejected the invitation and put its
entire armed forces on alert, saying the exercises are a sign of
U.S. agression. North Korea also cut off all dialogue with South
Korea.
   South Korean officials attributed the dispatch of Polish
observers to improved relations between the two countries. During
their nine-day stay, the Polish officers will be allowed to visit
the heavily fortified border.

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today called
Lithuania's declaration of independence ``alarming'' but gave no
indication he plans any action to prevent the Baltic republic from
breaking away.
   He did not, however, acknowledge the legality of the move,
continuing to refer to Lithuania as a Soviet republic and not by
the new name adopted by Lithuania's legislature.
   Another member of the ruling Communist Party Politburo told
reporters that the Kremlin will deal peacefully with Lithuania.
   ``We will not use force,'' Yegor K. Ligachev told reporters at
the Congress of People's Deputies in Moscow. ``We must resolve this
by political means.'' Ligachev is believed to be one of the more
conservative members of the party's ruling body.
   Gorbachev, opening a new session of the congress, noted that the
chairman of the Lithuanian delegation was absent from his chair on
the stage with other members of the Presidium.
   ``The information coming from Lithuania is alarming, and
momentous decisions are being made there that will affect both
Lithuania and the Soviet Union,'' Gorbachev told more than 2,000
deputies.
   The lawmakers had assembled in Moscow today to consider
constitutional amendments that would create a new, extraordinarily
powerful Soviet president and revoke the Communist Party's monopoly
on power.
   Gorbachev said the Congress should study the ``decisions adopted
in the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic,'' ignoring the
republic legislature's action Sunday declaring a sovereign
``Republic of Lithuania.''
   Just two weeks after pro-independence candidates won a two-third
majority in Lithuania's legislature, the body met in the Lithuanian
capital, Vilnius, and voted to restore sovereignty after 50 years
of Soviet rule.
   Lithuanian lawmakers acknowledge, though, that true independence
can only be won after long, difficult negotiations with the Kremlin.
   The hasty vote to secede was prompted by the convening of the
Congress to consider giving a new president powers that would
include the authority to dissolve republic parliaments and nullify
their actions.
   The newly elected legislature of the Baltic republic of 3.7
million people voted 124-0 with six abstentions to secede. It also
chose Vytautas Landsbergis, chairman of the nationalist Sajudis
movement, as president.
   ``The Supreme Council of the Republic of Lithuania, expressing
the will of the nation, resolves and solemnly proclaims that the
execution of the sovereign power of the Lithuanian state,
heretofore constrained by alien forces in 1940, is restored,'' the
legislature decreed.
   ``Henceforth Lithuania is once again an independent state,'' it
said.
   The decree proclaims that the local KGB and police, for most of
five decades instruments of Soviet terror and repression, must now
obey Lithuania rather than Moscow.
   After it was approved, legislators stood and joined hands,
chanting ``Lietuva, Lietuva'' (Lithuania). Outside, a small crowd
broke into wild cheers. Earlier, people tore down a metal Soviet
hammer-and-sickle seal over the building's door and some stamped on
it.
   ``That's the end of the Soviet regime,'' said a jubilant deputy
looking on.
   By itself, the decree effects little change in the relationship
between the Baltic republic and the Kremlin. But it was the first
crack in the union of 15 Soviet republics and more than 100
nationalities as a result of the burgeoning demands for autonomy
fostered by Gorbachev's reforms.
   In Washington, the Bush administration expressed support for
Lithuania's move toward independence but said it will delay formal
recognition until the Lithuanians are ``in control of their own
destiny.''
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the United
States would urge the Kremlin to ``respect the will of the citizens
of Lithuania.'' The United States has never recognized the forcible
1940 annexation of the three Soviet republics _ Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania.
   In Estonia on Sunday, an unofficial congress of delegates
elected by a majority of the republic's people denounced the Soviet
annexation and sought U.N. assistance in achieving independence.
   In addition to changing their homeland's name, the Lithuanian
legislators dropped the old seal that included a Soviet hammer,
sickle and star, replacing it with one showing a white knight on a
dark shield.
   Today, they were to consider a declaration touching the
thousands of Soviet soldiers on Lithuanian soil.
   Lithuania's declaration of independence represents perhaps the
biggest crisis yet for Gorbachev, who marked his fifth anniversary
as Soviet leader on Sunday.
   The outgoing president of Lithuania's parliament, Communist
Party chief Algirdas Brazauskas, said before the vote that approval
of secession could have a ``contagious effect'' on other republics.
   Gorbachev's troubles include rumblings for independence
elsewhere, serious economic problems and ethnic strife in many
areas of the nation.
   Leaders of Sajudis, which dominates the new Lithuanian
legislature, acknowledged that full independence would have to be
won in long, difficult negotiations.
   ``How soon we can implement this law depends not only on us,''
Landsbergis told a news conference.
   ``We have to sit down at the table,'' he told legislators in a
statement. ``We're not going to be beating our fists, but we have
to start settling accounts.''
   Gorbachev has said Lithuania will have to pay the Kremlin $34
billion for the factories and other infrastructure built during a
half-century of Soviet rule. Lithuanians say their bill for decades
of Soviet repression _ including mass deportations to Siberia under
Stalin _ will be even higher.
   Landsbergis, a 57-year-old music professor, received 91 votes
for the presidency in Sunday's vote, with 42 against. Brazauskas
got 38 votes, with 95 against.
   Stalin absorbed Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia _ all independent
between the world wars _ under a secret agreement with Germany on
the eve of the Nazi attack on Poland that started World War II.

   Demonstrations toppled governments in Eastern
Europe last year and now there are demonstrations here _ but with a
big difference.
   Twice last week, members of the small human rights community met
at differrent locales to try to advance their cause. Both times,
they were rudely interrupted by hundreds of noisy, pro-government
street demonstrators.
   According to the Communist Party newspaper Granma, neighbors
became aware of a dissident meeting Thursday at the home of a
well-known activist. Before long, with the help of indignant
passersby, a crowd had formed outside.
   The protest, like a similar incident March 5, has been labeled
an ``act of repudiation'' by the Communist Party media.
   Dissidents contend the protests are government-orchestrated; the
media insists they are spontaneous.
   Either way, the demonstrations seem to help the government in
its quest to nip potential trouble in the bud. If those who
disagree gain a foothold, life for the government could become
complicated.
   As things stand, the movement of Cubans who want more freedom is
small, demoralized and fearful. Two of the best known activists,
Elizardo Sanchez and Roberto Bahamonde, have been in prison since
last year.
   Seven of their allies were taken into custody Saturday, informed
sources said, but it is not clear whether charges will be filed
against them.
   Castro says scuttling the system he has built could nullify the
advances in health and education that the revolution has brought
about about in three decades.
   But judging the number of Cubans who agree with him is almost
impossible.
   His more fervent backers insist that support for the government
exceeds 80 percent and perhaps 90 percent.
   Others who find the system has both virtues and flaws believe
the support level is between 50 percent and 60 percent. Desperate
Cubans who have fled the island recently for Miami on rafts _ the
average is about 40 per month _ put the figure at closer to 10
percent.
   That estimate seems far lower than Castro deserves. There is
little doubt he has the allegiance of a higher percentage of his
people than any of the East European leaders who bowed out under
public pressure last year.
   Still, the mood here is uncertain and nervous as Cuba suddenly
finds itself almost without allies.
   At the international level, Cubans wonder if the United States,
fresh from its ouster of Panama's Manuel Antonio Noriega, will
target Cuba next.
   Cuba is so well-prepared for that eventuality, Castro has said,
that invading U.S. soldiers would spill ``rivers of blood.''
   On the economic front, Castro is openly questioning whether the
Soviet Union will be able to survive the wave of nationalist
uprisings.
   If not, Cuba could face, among other problems, the challenge of
finding an alternate supply of oil. The Soviets provide Cuba with
12 million tons of oil annually at preferential rates.
   Castro warned his countrymen last week that massive
energy-saving measures will have to be instituted if oil supplies
are sharply reduced.
   Mules may have to replace tractors on the farm. In Havana, bus
service may have to be curtailed by one-third, he said. The
manufacture of clothing may be limited exclusively for children.
   Castro confided to a visitor recently that he hasn't had a day
off in months because mf his accumulating troubles, but he also
seems to relish the new challenges.
   He said last week that Cubans are fortunate to be part of a
struggle against the ``giant counterrevolutionary tide'' that
threatens to engulf the world.
   ``It is a privilege for our country to have to face these
responsibilities,'' he said.

<HEAD>Avril Leaves A Lawless Country On U.S. Air Force Transport Plane</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 3 grafs to ADD White House comment; Pickup 3rd,
`After Avril...'</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril left Haiti
today aboard a U.S. Air Force transport plane, two days after the
military ruler was driven from power by widespread unrest.
   The deposed leader and his family arrived this morning at
Homestead Air Force Base, 25 miles south of Miami, the State
Department said. An Air Force spokesman in Washington, Lt. Col.
Darrell Hayes, said Avril was being driven to Boca Raton, Fla.,
after which he was ``on his own.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater refused comment on
whether the United States had granted Avril asylum but said: ``We
are hopeful for a smooth transition to democracy in Haiti and are
encouraging that effort.''
   After Avril left, the opposition coalition known as the Unity
Assembly reportedly picked Ertha Pascal-Trouillot, the only woman
on the 12-member Supreme Court, as its choice for provisional
president.
   The army's choice is Supreme Court president Gilbert Austin, but
he has been rejected by the coalition as too close to Avril. The
deadline for announcing a provisional president is Tuesday, when
Maj. Gen. Herard Abraham, who took over from Avril, is to transfer
power to a civilian.
   The new president will serve until an election is held.
   Thousands of people milled about Port-au-Prince, the capital,
but the mood was more one of disbelief than celebration.
   ``He's gone, he's gone,'' people were heard saying.
   The Rev. Bertrand Aristide, a Roman Catholic priest and staunch
critic of the military government, said residents should remain
alert to the possibility of army reprisals.
   ``We can smile, but we can't laugh yet,'' Aristide said on Radio
Haiti Inter after Avril's departure.
   At least 24 people were killed in seven days of protests and
clashes that have left this Caribbean nation without a leader and
in turmoil. Most of the victims have been civilians slain by
soldiers or police.
   ``The people have shown how much they love democracy by dying
for it,'' Aristide said earlier.
   A leading member of the Unity Assembly, Jean-Claude Roy, said
Ms. Pascal-Trouillot was the coalition's choice for provisional
president. Radio reports said Austin _ under the constitution next
in line for the presidency _ resigned from the court to make way
for Ms. Pascal-Trouillot.
   A widower, Ms. Pascal-Trouillot was Haiti's first woman judge
and is an author. Her best-known book, written in 1973, was ``The
Judicial Status of Haitian Women in Social Legislation.''
   If she is chosen as provisional president she would be the first
woman to hold the post in Haiti's history.
   Earlier, residents of the capital retreated behind shuttered
windows after sundown Sunday and the streets were deserted.
Soldiers in pickup trucks drove around the city and gunshots were
heard occasionally.
   ``I'm afraid for my husband and I fear the Macoutes will come
out of the walls,'' said the wife of a well-known politician,
speaking on condition of anonymity. The Tonton Macoutes were the
feared secret police of the Duvalier family, which ruled Haiti for
29 years.
   Numbering about 30,000, the Macoutes were disbanded after
Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to exile in France in February 1986.
Later, several hundred were integrated into the army and police as
special agents.
   Tele-Haiti, a private television station, urged viewers to stay
indoors Sunday night because ``there are gangs of marauding gunmen
in the streets'' and politicians and religious leaders urged
citizens to form neighborhood defense groups.
   The state hospital said it treated about 100 people, mostly for
gunshot wounds, over the weekend. Radio reports said soldiers
firing from a speeding truck killed five pedestrians on Sunday.
   In another incident, witnesses said police looking for the
killers of Maj. Renaud St. Bert stopped a passer-by, shot him four
times and sat under a tree for more than an hour watching him die.
   Avril was brought to power in a September 1988 revolt by
soldiers who professed disdain for political killings and other
abuses by the previous military ruler, Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy.
   Namphy had ruled the country _ among the poorest in the
hemisphere _ for most of the 2{ years since the popular uprising
that ousted Jeane-Claude Duvalier.
   This Caribbean nation of 6 million people has been ruled mainly
by the military since it gained independence from France in 1804,
and opposition leaders said they did not trust Avril to oversee
presidential elections he promised for the fall. In a January
crackdown, the government jailed and beat dozens of dissidents,
exiling seven.
   Protests against Avril broke out one week ago after a soldier
killed an 11-year-old girl, apparently by accident.
   Avril agreed to step down after negotiations reportedly
involving the U.S. and French embassies, the Roman Catholic Church
and opposition political parties.
   In Haiti's last attempt at elections, overseen by Namphy in
November 1987, voting was canceled after thugs backed by soldiers
killed at least 34 voters.

   A fiery, chain-reaction collision of 45
vehicles on a fog-shrouded, interstate bridge killed at least three
people and hospitalized two dozen others early today, police said.
   ``The catalyst was a three-car accident. How that happened I
don't know,'' said Deputy Chief of Traffic Robert Kreuser. ``From
there it was a chain-reaction. It just piled up.''
   The crash killed at least three people, said police Capt. Larry
Gille, who was coordinating rescue efforts in the northbound lanes
of the Tower Drive Bridge on Interstate 43, which spans the Fox
River.
   At least 24 people were treated at the city's two hospital
emergency rooms and three were admitted, officials said.
   ``It looks like it was exploding gas tanks from cars'' that
caused the fire, Gille said. Firefighters extinguished at least one
burning vehicle near near an oil company tanker trunk near the head
of the pileup, witnesses said.
   ``It's a matter of unpiling the cars and treating the injured,''
Kreuser said.
   Many of the injured had to be extricated from their cars.
Police, firefighters, ambulance and rescue crews _ including a
crane _ were dispatched to the bridge shortly after the accident
was reported at 6:45 a.m.
   ``Somebody said it's something you'd see in a Los Angeles
pile-up. It'll take a long time to see this thing out,'' police Lt.
Roy Johnson said.
   Minutes after the crash, dazed, bloodied drivers wandered in the
roadway near the crash site. Other victims lay on the ground near
the crest of the bridge, where other motorists went to help them.
   Twenty yards away, just east of the bridge's superstructure,
both northbound lanes were blocked by wreckage, some of it on fire.
   Leo Terry of Green Bay, his face smeared with blood, said he was
driving across the bridge when he entered a wall of fog, then
slammed into a car stopped in front of him. ``You couldn't see
nothing,'' he said.
   James Vandertie, 19, who escaped with a few fragments of glass
in his hand, said the chain reaction started when a van hit an oil
tanker. ``It was like boom, boom, boom, every couple of seconds,''
he said.
   Barbara Brandstatter of Red Banks said she was driving south
across the bridge when she saw the wreckage on the opposite side.
   She said the crest of the bridge had fair visibility at the time
of the accident, but another wall of fog was just beyond where she
stopped her car and set out flares.
   Traffic chief Kreuser said the accident was the worst he'd seen
in 28 years with the Green Bay department. ``We've never had
anything of this magnitude.''
   Green Bay, a city of 90,000 about 117 miles north of Milwaukee,
is widely known for its National Football League team, the Green
Bay Packers.

   ``Days of Thunder'' turned into a
night of dancing for actor Robert Duvall, who took a break from the
filming of his new movie to attend a shag dancing competition.
   For those who don't know, the shag is South Carolina's official
state dance, a step performed to rhythm and blues that isn't as
energetic as jitterbug.
   Duvall, in Darlington this week filming Paramount Picture's
``Days of Thunder'' starring Tom Cruise, danced during breaks and
handed out awards Saturday at the contest at a local nightclub.
   ``He's a very good beginning shagger,'' said Barry Thigpen,
contest organizer.
   Duvall, 58, who had several women waiting in line to dance with
him, told emcee Diane Devaughn Stokes he prefers the jitterbug.

   Shirley Temple Black, who witnessed the 1968
Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia and the country's 1989 ``velvet
revolution,'' said both events left her impressed by the spirit of
the Czechoslovak people.
   In April's McCall's magazine, Black, now the U.S. ambassador to
Czechoslovakia, says the revolution ``will be remembered as unique
among the upheavals of 1989 for its sense of purpose, its
discipline and the sheer joyousness of its spirit.''
   Black, 61, said she has been warmly greeted on trips through the
country by crowds who remember her films.
   ``In 1937, there were Shirley Temple fan clubs all over
Czechoslovakia,'' she said, adding that she met the founder of
those clubs: ``I thought he would be an old man. But he wasn't at
all. He must have been a child then, too.''

   New forms and new issues may be around,
but social activism still centers on human rights, says folksinger
and longtime activist Mary Travers, one-third of the folk trio
Peter, Paul and Mary.
   ``The issues today are a question of ecology, education and a
new virulent racism,'' said Ms. Travers, whose voice blended with
those of Peter Yarrow and Paul Stookey on ``Puff (the Magic
Dragon)'' and other hits.
   Ms. Travers, in Nashville to address the Jewish Federation's
annual fund-raising dinner, said Sunday the big difference between
activism in the '60s and that of today is wealth.
   ``In the 1960s, the economic infrastructure was healthy and
people could afford to be generous and help others get a piece of
the pie if their piece of the pie was secure,'' Ms. Travers said.

   Oakland A's outfielder Jose Canseco was
just doing what comes naturally when he picked off someone trying
to steal.
   A thief tried to roar off with Canseco's 42-foot boat while the
slugger was playing volleyball Sunday.
   Canseco had anchored near a beach club and swam ashore to play.
After the match, he spotted someone hiding behind his boat's
console.
   But the engine wouldn't start, giving Canseco time to call
police, who responded with a helicopter and boat.
   The man in the boat was charged with attempted grand theft, said
Miami Beach police spokesman Jim Hyde.

   Tammy Faye Bakker is back in action,
preaching Sunday sermons and keeping the faith for her jailed
husband at a new home for their New Covenant Church, in an
industrial park.
   The wife of former television evangelist Jim Bakker said
still-faithful former supporters of their now-defunct PTL ministry
are financing the newest church in a former office building. Bakker
is serving a 45-year federal prison sentence for defrauding
followers.
   Three months ago, a dispute over back rent forced the church out
of a shopping plaza and into a series of temporary quarters. Church
officials announced last week that they are buying the present
building.
   Reporters were not welcomed at Sunday's service, but Mrs. Bakker
told them part of her sermon concerned the poor.
   ``Love has no nose,'' Mrs. Bakker said, because poor people
``sometimes don't smell too good, so love can have no nose.''

<HEAD>First Red Army Contingent Leaves Hungary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX BANDY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HAJMASKER, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet troops boarded trains and
headed for home Monday, the first to leave Hungary as part of an
agreement to remove all Red Army soldiers from the country by June
30, 1991.
   A military band played the Soviet and the Hungarian national
anthems as the first contingent of 300 troops and 37 combat
infantry vehicles pulled out. Moscow has 49,700 troops in Hungary.
   The withdrawal began just two weeks after the Kremlin began
bringing home troops from neighboring Czechoslovakia where a
similar agreement was reached last month on the removal of all
73,500 Soviet soldiers there.
   Moscow has committed itself to remove the last of its troops and
equipment from both countries by June 30, 1991.
   Not many Hungarians turned out in this tiny village station to
see off the Red Army soldiers.
   ``I am just glad to see them go,'' said Miklos Szilasi, an
elderly resident. ``I saw them come and I'll really believe it only
when the last one leaves.''
   Soviet troops have been in Hungary since the end of World War
II. They are mainly associated with the bloody crushing of the 1956
uprising for more democracy and a multiparty system.
   Moscow agreed to withdraw its troops in the initial days of the
revolt, but instead of departing, reinforcements poured in to crush
the uprising.
   The start of the withdrawal comes just two weeks before
Hungarians go to the polls March 25 for the first free, multiparty
elections since the Communists consolidated power in 1948.
   Some opposition leaders have said the new government might try
to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement with Moscow to move forward
the completion date.
   As the troops boarded the trains and combat vehicles were
fastened to flatbed rail cars, activists from the opposition League
of Young Democrats held up banners reading, ``Hurry Home! Sunny
Azerbaijan Awaits You!'' _ a sarcastic reference to Kremlin's
dispatching soldiers to quell ethnic strife in the Soviet Caucasus.
   ``They should leave as fast as they came in,'' said Zsuzsa
Szelenyi.
   The withdrawal agreement was signed in Moscow on Saturday by
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and his Hungarian
counterpart, Gyula Horn.
   ``I think that the overwhelming majority of our people wanted to
see this agreement,'' said Ferenc Somogyi, the No. 2 in the Foreign
Ministry who negotiated the agreement and who came to this town 75
miles southwest of Budapest to see the first troops off.
   Addressing the opposition's concern that the withdrawal be
accelerated, Somogyi said: ``We considered it of crucial importance
to get the pullout under way without delay. I do not exclude the
possibility of shortening the deadline, but we think it is a tight
one.''
   He noted the agreement stipulates that the withdrawal must be
completed before June 30, 1991.
   Maj. Gen. Viktor Shilov, first deputy to the commander-in-chief
of the Southern Group of Forces stationed in Hungary, said the
pullouts ``will now be a daily event from various parts of Hungary.
By the end of this year 70 percent of the combat forces will be
withdrawn.''
   Somogyi said ``the Soviet evaluation of 1956 is still to come.''
   Hungary would like to see an admission by Moscow concerning its
role in 1956 similar to the apology extended to Prague for the 1968
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact invasion that crushed reforms there.
   Shilov noted: ``It is good to be a guest, but it is even better
to go home.''
   ``Some guests _ 45 years!'' said an old peasant under his breath.

   U.S. officials helped convince Lt. Gen.
Prosper Avril to yield power without a fight in Haiti and President
Bush ordered an evacuation flight for the ex-ruler because he felt
``some obligation'' to the general, the White House said today.
   Avril and his family were airlifted by C-141 transport jet this
morning to Homestead Air Force Base 25 miles outside Miami.
   Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said, ``We are
hopeful for a smooth transition to democracy in Haiti and are
encouraging that effort.''
   He refused to say whether the United States has granted Avril
asylum.
   ``He did meet with out ambassador over the weekend and did
request that we provide transportation the United States. President
Bush agreed and sent a C-141 to pick him up,'' said Fitzwater.
   Asked if the U.S. ambassador, Alvin P. Adams, had talked Avril
into stepping down, Fitzwater said, ``We had discussions with him
about a transition and one of the reasons we offered him
transportation to the United States was a feeling of some
obligation to help him leave power and facilitate a peaceful
transition.''
   ``We were helpful in facilitating his departure,'' said
Fitzwater.
   An Air Force spokesman in Washington, Lt. Col. Darrell Hayes,
said Avril was being driven to Boca Raton, Fla., after which he was
``on his own.''
   Fitzwater said Avril ``has a temporary sanctuary here,'' but
``we don't know what his long term plans are.''
   Fitzwater said Avril has indicated he wants to stay in the Miami
area ``a few days. His plans beyond that are unknown. We're still
talking to him about that.'' he said.
   ``We aren't prepared to discuss Mr. Avril's future at this
point,'' said Fitzwater.
   The United States also provided an Air Force jet in February
1986 to evacuate Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier to France,
ending 29 years of dictatorships under Duvalier and his father,
Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier. The father died in 1971 after 14
years of iron fist rule.
   Fitzwater said the United States had not placed any
``conditions'' on the new government that is to be set up in Haiti.
The Haitians are scheduled to vote in local elections in April and
in presidential elections in October and November.
   With Avril gone, power rested in the hands of Maj. Gen. Herard
Abraham, the army chief of staff, who was to name a provisional
president by Tuesday.
   The United States currently is providing $41.4 million in
humanitarian and development assistance to Haiti through private
voluntary and non-governmental agency.
   It cut off direct assistance to the government of Haiti
following an election massacre in November 1987, but did provide
$10 million in emergency food assistance last year.
   ``We have said in the past that any other resumption of
assistance to the Haitian government will be contingent upon
tangible evidence of progress and a transition to democracy and to
respect for human rights,'' said Fitzwater.
   ``We are consulting with other interested governments in the
area on the process of transition,'' he said.

   A reporters committee said Monday that the
Bush White House is ``bent on orchestrating'' the news and listed
nearly 100 instances of restrictions, such as excluding a press
pool from early coverage of the Panama invasion.
   ``Our report illustrates the Bush administration's obsession
with secrecy and leaks,'' said Jane E. Kirtley, executive director
of The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, a non-profit
research and service organization.
   ``It chronicles the activities of a White House bent on
orchestrating and controlling the presentation of news,'' she said.
``The policy clearly fails to serve the interests of the American
people.''
   The report, the first on the Bush administration, was released
to mark Freedom of Information Day on March 16.
   In addition to exclusion of the Pentagon-approved 16-member news
pool from early combat in Panama, the 42-page list included:
   _Pentagon refusal to release combat footage shot by the military.
   _Directives to regional offices of the Department and Housing
and Urban Development and the Immigration and Naturalization
Service to clear answers to reporters' questions with Washington
headquarters.
   _A Justice Department policy change subjecting federal officials
who leak information about on-going criminal investigations to
possible prosecution for theft of government property.
   _Attorney General Dick Thornburgh's lay-off of six career
spokesmen in the 10-person Justice Department press office.
   The actions listed were categorized as either
``disinformation,'' ``prior restraints,'' ``secret government'' and
``policing thought.''
   In 1988, the committee issued its final annual report on similar
actions in the Reagan administration. That list contained more than
200 entries.

   Sir Eric Gairy, the eccentric
former prime minister deposed in a leftist coup 11 years ago, is
attempting a comeback in Grenada's second general election since
the U.S.-led invasion of 1983.
   Gairy, who dominated the tiny Caribbean island's politics for
three decades before his ouster, faces competition from three
moderates and one leftist in what could be a close vote Tuesday.
   ``We are right down to the wire, but it is not clear who is in
the lead,'' said Michael Minors, president of the Grenada Chamber
of Commerce.
   The election falls on the 11th anniversary of the leftist coup
that ousted Gairy's authoritarian regime and brought the People's
Revolutionary Government of the late Prime Minister Maurice Bishop
to power.
   An ideological rift within Bishop's government led to his
assassination, along with 10 other people, on Oct. 19, 1983. Six
days later, U.S. troops, accompanied by a small regional force,
invaded the island and ousted a Marxist junta that had seized power.
   Herbert Blaize, a staunch U.S. ally, won the first election
after the invasion in 1984. He died in December at the age of 71.
   Gairy, 68, is nearly blind with glaucoma and had said that he
would not contest the election unless a ``miracle'' improved his
sight.
   But at a recent news conference, he declared that ``a source
which is greater than I'' ordained that he lead Grenada once again
despite his failing sight. He asserted that it was no coincidence
the election was being held on the anniversary of his ouster.
   ``No man on Earth could have arranged this,'' he said. ``It had
to be arranged cosmically by a divine force.''
   Gairy, who was Grenada's first prime minister after independence
from Britain in 1974, has been dogged throughout his career by
allegations of corruption and repression.
   His interest in the occult has made him an occasional object of
ridicule. He was deposed on March 13, 1979, while in New York
trying to persuade the United Nations to investigate flying saucers.
   But Gairy maintains strong support among farm workers _ he
founded Grenada's first trade union _ the urban poor and the
elderly. His followers call him ``Uncle Gairy,'' and voters are
largely divided between pro- and anti-Gairy forces rather than
along party lines.
   Since the invasion, the United States has pumped more than $110
million into Grenada, a nation of 94,000 people, but a widely
expected bonanza of foreign investment has never occurred. The
campaign, however, has focused more on personalities than economic
issues.
   The other main contenders for prime minister are all regarded as
moderates. They are Prime Minister Ben Jones, 66, a former foreign
minister appointed as Blaize's replacement pending the election;
Keith Mitchell, 44, a U.S.-educated statistician who was fired by
Blaize as public works minister in a personality and policy
dispute; and Nicholas Brathwaite, 65, who led an interim government
after the U.S. invasion.
   A fifth candidate, Dr. Terrence Marryshow, 37, a Cuban-trained
doctor and leader of the leftist Maurice Bishop Patriotic Movement,
is considered to have virtually no chance of winning.
   No voter opinion polls have been published, but most Grenadians
expect a close election. Some believe no single party will win a
majority of the 15 seats in the House of Representatives, Grenada's
Parliament, which could result in a coalition government.

<TEXT>
   The ruling Communist Party and democratic
oposition groups signed an agreement Monday ensuring equal terms
for parties competing in multiparty elections in June, state radio
reported.
   The agreement also guarantees a peaceful transition to democracy.
   The measures must be approved by the Communist-dominated
parliament.
   Communist Party chief Alexander Lilov, who led his party's
delegation to the talks for the first time, said the accords were
important for the political future of Bulgaria and called for
mutual respect and responsibility between parties.
   Petko Simeonov, a senior opposition official and director of the
opposition newspaper Demokratsiya, termed the agreement ``a victory
of democratic forces,'' the radio said.
   The inter-party talks were the first held in a month.
   The largest opposition group, the Union of Democratic Forces,
suspended the negotiations Feb. 12, saying the Communists refused
to abolish their party organizations at work places. The Communists
since have promised to withdraw the organizations.
   The agreements came after a weekend conference of opposition
parties in Plovdiv, Bulgaria's second largest city, where four
small non-aligned democratic parties joined the Union of Democratic
Forces, which comprises 19 different factions.
   Two small non-Communist opposition groups, the Political
Opposition Block, and the the Alternative Socialist Party, have
refused to join the main opposition alliance despite initial
promises to do so.

<HEAD>Subway Victim's Foot Saved by Grafting It to Arm</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors on Monday claimed initial success for an
operation in which a man whose foot was severed by a subway train
had it grafted onto his forearm.
   A team of 10 doctors headed by Dr. Maurice Mimoun of the Hopital
Rothschild worked more than six hours Thursday to save the
40-year-old accident victim's leg and foot.
   The patient, who was not identified, fell onto the subway tracks
just as the train was pulling into the station. The wheels mangled
his lower right leg and cleanly cut off the foot.
   Paramedics arrived within minutes and stabilized the victim, who
was bleeding heavily and going into shock. Other rescue workers
found the severed foot on the track and whisked it to the hospital
along with the man.
   ``There I was confronted with a foot in perfect condition and a
stump that needed several weeks to heal before the foot could be
sewn back on,'' Mimoun said.
   ``I had to think of a way to preserve the foot for as long as
possible,'' he said in an interview. ``But I had never thought of
doing this before.''
   If the legs heals properly _ it could take as little as three
weeks or as long as three months _ Mimoun said he will reattach the
foot to the stump.
   ``The patient should be able to walk normally. Without the
temporary graft, amputation would have been necessary,'' he said.
The leg may be a little bit shorter, he added, but there are many
ways to compensate and prevent a significant limp.
   Mimoun said the patient was under sedation and did not know he
had undergone the surgery, which was authorized by the victim's
family.
   The results of the surgery were shown on French TV Sunday night:
the swollen, blood-stained foot resting in a prayer position over
the hand, which was uninjured.
   Mimoun said the use of ``relay grafts'' is common practice among
plastic surgeons who often try to save healthy muscle or skin
tissue by grafting it onto the forearm.
   ``The forearm is used because it has two major blood vessels,
one of which can be used to vascularize whatever needs to be
saved,'' Mimoun said. He said the arm would supply the grafted foot
with enough blood to keep it alive.
   Mimoun said the relay graft was a success thus far and gave the
credit to being able to assemble a trauma team in 15 minutes. He
said some of the patient's swelling had already gone down and there
was no sign of infection.
   ``It's still too early to cry victory, but I'm optimistic,''
Mimoun said.

<HEAD>Monte-Carlo Restaurateur Wins Michelin Third Star</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUZY PATTERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 1990 Michelin guide book on Monday awarded
three stars to Alain Ducasse, chef at the Louis XV restaurant in
Monte-Carlo's Hotel de Paris, making him the youngest person ever
to be so honored.
   But the gourmets' bible demoted L'Oustau de Baumaniere, a famous
restaurant in Les Baux in southern France, to two stars after 35
years as a three-star restaurant.
   Michelin's famous red guide, which goes on sale Wednesday, thus
retained only 19 restaurants in the three-star category. The
best-selling guidebook, which last year sold more than 750,000
copies, can make or break a restaurant's reputation.
   Ducasse, 33, was jubilant at his three stars.
   ``I think Michelin is now starting to honor the younger
generation as the hope of French cuisine,'' he said in an interview.
   The son of a farmer in southwest France, Ducasse said, ``I grew
up with the garden-grown vegetables, with rabbits and chickens, and
my golden rule is to use the best of fresh ingredients.''
   Ducasse learned his trade with several giants of French
gastronomy, starting at age 16 as an apprentice at the Pavillon
Landais in Soustons in southwestern France.
   He then moved on to apprentice with Michel Guerard, assisting in
writing the famous low-fat cookbook, ``Cuisine Minceur,'' while at
Guerard's three-star restaurant in Eugenie-les-Bains.
   He also worked with such gastronomic luminaries as Gaston
LeNotre in his pastry ``factory'' outside Paris, Roger Verge at his
three-star Moulin de Mougins near Cannes, and Alain Chapel in
Mionnay near Lyons.
   In 1979 he returned to Mougins as chef for Verge's less
expensive annex, l'Amandier, and from 1981-86 was chef at the Juana
Hotel in Juan-les-Pins.
   In 1987, he was chosen personally by Prince Rainier of Monaco as
chef for the renovated Belle Epoque-style Louis XV restaurant at
the Hotel de Paris.
   ``The prince wanted this to be a world-class restaurant,''
Ducasse said. The Louis XV is the only hotel restaurant to garner
three stars in the history of the guide, which started in 1900.
   Michelin also awarded a first star to the hotel's rooftop Grill
Room.
   Under Ducasse, the Louis XV won its first star in 1987 and its
second in 1988 before the 1990 accolade that made it ``worth a
detour'' in the guidebook's parlance.
   This is a spectacular rise, as the guidebook is circumspect in
its choices. Anonymous inspectors visit a restaurant several times
for months or years before handing out the little ``stars'' that
actually look like rosettes.
   Six restaurants were demoted from two stars to one, including
Paris' Pre-Catalan in the Bois de Boulogne and Le Petit Bedon. And
57 restaurants fell from one star to none. These include some
well-known Paris eateries such as Lamazere, Gildo, Le Bistrot de
Paris and l'Aquitaine.
   The reason that Baumaniere lost its third star is ``mainly that
it's going through a transitional period,'' according to Alain
Arnaud, a spokesman for Michelin. Arnaud said the former chef,
Raymond Thuilier, has handed over the reins to his grandson, and
for Michelin the results are still tentative.
   Meanwhile, Ducasse was busy in the Monegasque kitchens, turning
out his famous delicacies that include a risotto with white Italian
truffles, ``little vegetables'' sauteed with fresh black truffles,
warm seafood salad, and giant pasta made with parsley to look like
a mosaic.
   ``Of course, I'm near Italy and their cuisine influences me,''
said Ducasse. ``I'm aiming to produce `flavors of the sun' in my
food, a Mediterranean style based on its wonderful seafood,
vegetables, olive oil.''
   Just back from a tour of Japan, where he created a new menu for
the Okura Hotel restaurant in Tokyo, Ducasse said he was impressed
by the freshness of Japanese cuisine.
   ``Americans, too, have marvelous produce,'' he said. ``But the
average American seems to consume too much sugar and starch, making
for less healthy and more fattening cuisine than Japanese.''
   Although the red guide will be snapped up for its restaurant
recommendations, it is still basically a guide for drivers, giving
exhaustive information about hotels, distances between towns,
garages and auto dealers.

   Military personnel who helped finance the
construction of bases now slated for closing will be losing the
$400 million they invested in commissaries and base exchanges, two
congressmen said Monday.
   ``In effect, military people paid 5 percent higher prices to
finance construction of facilities such as PXs, commissaries and
recreation buildings,'' Rep. Marvin Leath, D-Texas, said in a
statement. ``They donated these facilities to the government's
inventory upon completion.''
   Joining Leath in the criticism was Rep. David O'B. Martin, R-N.Y.
   The Commission on Base Realignment and Closure recommended in
December 1988 closing 86 domestic bases, partly closing five others
and changing the mission of 54 other installations for an estimated
savings of $694 million a year and a 20-year savings estimated at
$5.6 billion.
   Former Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci approved the
recommendations and Congress, despite some complaints, last year
overwhelmingly supported the commission's decision.
   Earlier this year, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney recommended
closing or scaling back more than 72 domestic facilities and 14
overseas installations. Members of Congress, including Rep. Les
Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, have
criticized Cheney's list as partisan.
   Leath and Martin said that based on their calculations closing
the 86 bases as well as the domestic installations Cheney has
recommended would cost U.S. personnel about $240 million. If
overseas bases were included, the cost would be approximately $400
million.
   ``Base closures are being billed as a step to reduce costs to
the taxpayer,'' Martin said in a statement. ``Military personnel
are taxpayers too. They had to dig deep into their pockets to build
these facilities and they should be compensated for their
contributions.''
   Martin gave no specific proposals on how the personnel might be
compensated.
   Leath is the chairman and Martin the ranking Republican on the
House Armed Services panel on morale, welfare and recreation.

   A red oak tree a few miles down the road
from Terry A. Anderson's hometown was just a sapling when Monica
Stocum tied a yellow ribbon around it soon after he was abducted in
Lebanon on March 16, 1985.
   Now, the tree has grown enough to burst the ribbon, engulfing
parts of it in the tree's new growth. The one-time sapling will
soon be big enough to shelter a picnic.
   ``My God, a tree grows slowly and look at how it has grown,''
Stocum said.
   Anderson is still a hostage, held captive longer than any other
Westerner in Lebanon. But in this town of about 17,000 people,
Stocum and hundreds like her are keeping his memory alive, even
though they have never met him.
   An informal group organizes ceremonies to commemorate Anderson's
birthdays and the anniversaries of his kidnapping. On Friday, the
fifth anniversary of his abduction from the streets of Beirut, they
will attend services and fast for 24 hours as a gesture of
spirituality and support.
   Hometown solidarity and admiration for the efforts of Anderson's
sister, Peggy Say, to free all the Western hostages in Lebanon have
spurred those efforts, said Anne Zickl, a member of the group.
   ``Terry Anderson graduated from Batavia High School. So did my
mother and father and I. So did my four kids. So you have a
connection right there,'' said Mrs. Zickl. ``Plus, I think
Americans don't like injustice.''
   Stocum moved to nearby Le Roy 15 years after Anderson left the
area, but said the hometown tie was important to her as well.
   ``I probably wouldn't know him if I fell over him in the street,
even with the pictures,'' she said. ``It just seems like we should
be more alert because he's one of us.''
   Anderson left Batavia, in dairy country 40 miles east of
Buffalo, in 1965 to join the Marines. He went on to a career in
journalism that took him, as chief Middle East correspondent for
The Associated Press, to Lebanon.
   His father, Glenn R. Anderson, and brother, Glenn Richard Jr.,
remained here, and after Terry was kidnapped Say moved back to be
with them, said Penny Anderson, a sister-in-law. The father and
brother have since died.
   ``She was always the strong one of the family,'' Mrs. Anderson
said.
   Since then, Say has been the most persistent and outspoken
advocate of her brother's cause. Her efforts drew admiration and
offers of help locally, from longtime friends like Marsha Barton
and strangers such as Mrs. Zickl.
   They now form a support team for Say, who has moved to Kentucky
but continues to travel the world to press for her brother's
freedom.
   Working from Mrs. Zickl's dining room _ her family has not eaten
there in 1{ years _ they publish newsletters, collect Valentine's
Day and Christmas cards for Anderson and field inquiries from
reporters from around the world.
   ``We just function here to give Peggy as much support as we can,
because Peggy is the one who can do the most for the hostages,''
Mrs. Zickl said.
   There have been more than enough dashed hopes, and as they plan
for the fifth anniversary of Anderson's capture, they find
themselves trying to stifle excitement over Iran's recently
softened stance on the hostage issue.
   ``My head is saying, `Now, don't get excited. We've heard all
this before,''' Mrs. Anderson said. ``My heart says he's coming
home. I woke up Monday morning absolutely positive he's coming
home.''
   Friday's fast, they hope, will give the kidnappers one more
nudge toward that goal.
   ``I think that people in other countries find Americans very
arrogant and very self-indulgent,'' Mrs. Zickl said. ``For them to
know that Americans are fasting, not on their own behalf but for
peace and freedom in the Middle East, I think they'll find that
very moving.''

<TEXT>
   The Iranian mentor of Shiite Moslem
kidnappers in Lebanon says some of the Western captives are spies
and none of the ``mercenary U.S. hostages'' should be freed.
   In a signed editorial published Saturday in the Tehran newspaper
Kayhan and received Monday by The Associated Press in Nicosia, Ali
Akbar Mohtashemi said the sentence for espionage in an Islamic
country is death.
   Mohtashemi attacked those who suggest Iran help free the
hostages. The former interior minister leads the powerful radical
faction, which opposes President Hashemi Rafsanjani's policy of
improving relations with the West.
   ``The Islamic Republic of Iran cannot and should not impose its
policies and views on other Moslem nations,'' Mohtashemi wrote in
the Persian-language newspaper, an apparent reference to Lebanon
and the hostage-holders.
   ``Furthermore, freedom for the hostages means breaking the
chains of bloodthirsty wolves. The sentence for a spy in an Islamic
country is death.'' Eight Americans, four Britons, two West
Germans, two Swiss, an Irishman and an Italian are missing in
Lebanon and believed to be hostages.
   Held longest is Terry A. Anderson, 42, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, who this week will mark five
years in captivity. He was abducted March 16, 1985.
   Mohtashemi's editorial conflicted with Rafsanjani's indications
last week that the hostages might be freed. It was not carried by
the official Islamic Republic News Agency, which regularly excerpts
important articles from Iranian papers.
   Rafsanjani, who seeks Western investment and technology to
revive Iran's sluggish economy, told a news conference March 7 the
hostage issue was ``moving toward a solution.''
   Al-Qabas, a Kuwaiti newspaper, said in a dispatch Monday from
Syria, that Iranian radicals wanted guarantees Hezbollah, the
umbrella group for most groups holding hostages, would not be
disbanded after the captives were freed.
   ``The hard-line groups in Iran which possess the key card in the
file of the Western hostages held in Lebanon have asked President
Hashemi Rafsanjani for concrete guarantees about the future of
Hezbollah party in Lebanon as one of the conditions for the release
of the captives,'' the paper said.
   Mohtashemi said calls for hostage releases in the Tehran Times,
a paper allied with Rafsanjani, and by Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah,
spiritual leader of Hezbollah, had ``created a new climate inside
the country and abroad'' that ``heightened the pressure on the
Islamic revolution and the Moslems of Lebanon.''
   ``Instead of putting pressure on the wronged Lebanese Moslems to
release the mercenary U.S. hostages, world public opinion should
look for the center of hostage-taking at the White House and among
Western and American intelligence services,'' Mohtashemi said.
   He said some hostages were spies for the CIA and named Terry
Waite, special envoy of the archbishop of Canterbury, who
disappeared in west Beirut in January 1987 after leaving his hotel
to negotiate with hostage-holders. The church has denied such
charges.
   According to Mohtashemi, who helped found Hezbollah in 1983
while ambassador to Syria, said recent publicity in the West about
the hostages ``does not mean the West and the U.S. want a solution
to the hostage problem,'' but is ``a tactic to confront Islam.''
   Those holding the hostages should not be condemned, he said,
because ``the West and the U.S. have turned the Third World and
Islamic countries, especially Lebanon and Palestine, into big
prisons. When prisoners carry out reprisals and take a few of their
jailers hostage for some period of time to achieve their just
rights, colonialist networks raise a hue and cry.''
   Mohtashemi denied Iran was involved in hostage taking.
   ``The Islamic Republic of Iran has not been involved in any
stages of hostage taking in Lebanon and the Moslem Lebanese forces
have been and are operating on their own,'' he said in the
editorial.
   Rafsanjani excluded Mohtashemi when he formed his Cabinet in
August. Four months later, the former interior minister won an
important Tehran seat in the 270-member parliament, which is
dominated by radicals.
   The Kuwait newspaper said the United States was urging Syria to
crack down on Hezbollah by moving its forces into the Shiite slums
of south Beirut, where most of the hostages are believed held.
   Syria, an ally of Iran, has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon, but has
kept them out of the Shiite slums. The soldiers are there under a
peackeeping mandate issued by the Arab League in 1976, the year
after Lebanon's civil war began.

<HEAD>North Says Poindexter Ordered Him to Withhold Iran-Contra Details</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oliver L. North, scolded by the judge for
``quibbling'' on the witness stand, testified Monday that John M.
Poindexter instructed him to withhold from Congress key details of
the Iran-Contra affair.
   Testifying at Poindexter's Iran-Contra coverup trial, the former
National Security Council aide also said that his one-time boss
approved the diversion of U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to buy
weapons for the Nicaraguan Contras.
   ``You got the full permission and authority to do that from
Admiral Poindexter?'' prosecutor Dan Webb said of the diversion.
   ``Yes,'' North said.
   ``Before you did it, you cleared each one of these
(transactions) with Admiral Poindexter before they occurred?'' Webb
asked.
   ``Yes,'' said the retired Marine lieutenant colonel.
   Asked if he remembered Poindexter saying that the diversion
should ``never ever be revealed,'' North replied he did not
``recall the specific direction, but I do remember the general
admonition.''
   Poindexter, a retired Navy rear admiral who was President
Reagan's national security adviser in 1986, is accused of
obstructing congressional inquiries into the Iran-Contra affair,
making false statements and destroying key documents.
   North looked away without replying when Webb said, ``Good
Morning, Col. North.'' He was rebuked several times by U.S.
District Judge Harold Greene for ``quibbles'' with the prosecutor
over minor details or for repeatedly failing to remember
significant ones.
   ``Almost every time a question is asked, he says he can't
recall,'' the judge complained. ``It's like pulling teeth.''
   Later, Greene directed North not to try to ``embroider'' his
answer with explanations that only made his responses less clear.
   ``Just answer the question,'' he told North, who was declared a
hostile witness at the outset of his testimony last Friday.
   ``Let's try to stick to the facts,'' Greene said. ``Yes, your
honor,'' North replied.
   North conceded that when he met Aug. 6, 1986, with congressmen
inquiring about news reports concerning covert assistance to the
Nicaraguan rebels, he was following general instructions from
Poindexter to conceal the operation.
   Webb pursued the line of questioning to try to dispel North's
insistence on Friday that ``nobody told me to lie to Congress.''
   The prosecutor asked North if he knew that Poindexter had
``generally instructed you'' to conceal both the Contra assistance
operation and the diversion of profits from the still-secret
U.S.-Iran arms sales.
   ``Yes, but it was to conceal it or withhold that information
from anybody,'' North replied.
   ``You knew he had generally instructed you to conceal facts from
Congress?'' Webb asked.
   ``It's inclusive in that, yes,'' North replied only after Webb
produced a transcript of the former White House aide's sworn
acknowledgement to Congress of receiving Poindexter's instructions.
   ``You knew that you were denying important facts that Congress
needed to make decisions?'' Webb said.
   ``I didn't recall thinking about it,'' North said.
   The prosecutor showed North the testimony he gave Congress in
1987, when the former White House aide admitted that he had
concealed important information from lawmakers.
   ``That's how I answered the question,'' North said.
   Poindexter is charged with conspiracy, obstruction of Congress
and making false statements to lawmakers to conceal the secret
Contra resupply operation set up after Congress banned U.S.
military aid to the rebels.
   The indictment accuses Poindexter of destroying documents and
lying to hide White House knowledge of a November 1985 shipment of
18 Hawk anti-aircraft missiles to Iran.
   North was convicted last year of aiding and abetting an
obstruction of Congress as well as destruction or alteration of key
Iran-Contra documents.

<HEAD>Israel Denies it Plans Settlement in South Lebanon</HEAD>

   The Foreign Ministry on Monday denied a claim
by Lebanese villagers that Israel plans to build a settlement in
its self-declared security zone in south Lebanon.
   Villagers in south Lebanon petitioned their government Monday to
prevent an American from establishing what they said would be the
first Israeli settlement on Lebanese soil.
   But deputy Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Baruch Bina said:
``The story is totally untrue. It is nonsense.''
   A statement by the Lebanese government said the petition was
made by representatives of Rashaya Foukhar, a town of 5,000 people
in the security zone. It was addressed to President Elias Hrawi,
Prime Minister Salim Hoss and Parliament speaker Hussein Husseni.
   The petition said William Robinson, who it described as a
Jewish-American immigrant, moved to settle in the town's school
after Israel's 1982 invasion and gradually brought in relatives and
Israeli acquaintances.
   But an official with a fundamentalist Christian organization in
Israel said Robinson was an evangelical Christian, who, with his
family, has been trying to help orphans and handicapped children.
   The Lebanese petition said Robinson ``seized the pine forests
near Rashaya Foukhar and recently brought in Israeli engineers to
build houses for 100 families to live outside the town.''
   It said most of these families would be Jews who emigrated to
Israel from the United States and Ethiopia in the last two years.
   ``We appeal to you to move quickly to block the establishment of
the first Zionist settlement on Lebanese territory,'' the petition
added.
   It accused the command of a Norwegian battalion serving with the
U.N. peacekeeping force in south Lebanon of ``collaborating with
Robinson'' but gave no details.
   Timur Goksel, spokesman for the U.N. peacekeepers, described the
incident as a local quarrel. He said the force's only contact with
the Robinson family was that ``our soldiers during Christmas gave
gifts to the five children at the school.''
   Rashaya Foukhar, in the foothills of Mount Hermon, is eight
miles northeast of the Israeli border and part of a 6- to
10-mile-wide buffer strip patrolled by Israeli troops and the
Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia. The zone was established
in 1985 when Israel withdrew the bulk of its invasion force from
South Lebanon ending a three-year occupation.

   Three-time winner Susan Butcher and
defending champion Joe Runyan, their dog teams well rested, gained
on Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race leader Lavon Barve today as they
pulled into this checkpoint on Norton Sound.
   Resting his dogs only 3{ hours, Barve was about four hours ahead
of Butcher and Runyan when they left Kaltag, the last checkpoint on
the Yukon River, for the 90-mile run to Unalakleet, the gateway to
the Bering Sea.
   Butcher, with eight hours rest, and Runyan with five, were both
less than two hours behind Barve when they hit Unalakleet, where
racers were expected to rest about six hours before heading up the
coast for the last 170 miles to Nome.
   Leaving Kaltag behind Runyan were Tim Osmar, four-time champion
Rick Swenson, DeeDee Jonrowe and Robin Jackobson of Squaw Lake,
Minn.
   Runyan said any one of the first five racers could win the race
in the last 170-mile sprint to Nome.
   ``If you want to make a good bet, never bet on a dog race,'' he
said. ``It's really shaken out which team is healthy and really
fit. Looks to me like it's anybody's bet what's going on here.''
   Before leaving Kaltag, Runyan said the leaders in the 18th
running of the 1,158-mile race had come under the spell of what he
called the ``crazy syndrome.''
   ``Everybody's pushing pushing pushing,'' Runyan said.
   Runyan called his dogs ``little bio-mechanisms'' that have to be
understood, cared for and appreciated. ``The trick is to be
predictable for the dogs,'' said Runyan.
   Because of his habit of running behind his sled rather than
riding its rails when it heads up hills, Kaltag area residents have
begun calling him ``Runnin' Runyan.''
   Butcher said it was wrong to assume she was leading the race
from Anchorage to Nome just because she had been first to reach
Kaltag. She said everybody was running their own race with
different strategies.
   Named for an abandoned gold-mining town along the trail, the
Iditarod race was started in 1973 to commemorate the 1925 emergency
delivery of life-saving diphtheria serum from Anchorage to Nome by
sled dog teams.
   Retired Col. Norman Vaughan, at 84 the oldest musher, was
reported in 63rd place in McGrath, 389 miles into the race. Vaughan
was a member of Admiral Byrd's Antarctic expedition and competed at
the Lake Placid, N.Y. Olympics in 1932.
   Six mushers have scratched out of the 70 who began the race
March 3.

<HEAD>11 Militants Arrested; Leader Dies in Escape Attempt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police on Monday arrested 11 Moslem
militants suspected of fanning sectarian violence, and their leader
was electrocuted when he jumped out a window onto power lines while
fleeing authorities, an official said.
   In raids in El-Minya province, police also seized thousands of
leaflets and weapons allegedly used in clashes there between
Egypt's Moslem majority and its Coptic Christian minority, said
Interior Minister Abdel-Halim Moussa.
   The southern province has been the scene of recent violence
against Coptics. Two churchs and a youth club were set alight and
stoned, while a candy factory and several shops owned by Coptics
were burned.
   Moussa, whose remarks were distributed by the state Middle East
News Agency, did not identify the man reported to have leaped to
his death in El-Minya other than as leader of the alleged militant
group. But state-owned newspapers identified him as Sherif Saber
Mohammed, a techncian.
   As police raided the man's house, he tried to flee by jumping
from his second-floor apartment, Moussa said. ``He fell on power
lines and was electrocuted,'' he said.
   The news agency alleged the man opened fire on police before
jumping but did not mention police casualties.
   Moussa said policemen seized about 8,000 leaflets ``inciting
sectarian strife and exploiting economic difficulties to instigate
the masses against the government.''
   Police also confiscated about 30 firebombs and an unspecified
number of chains and swords, he said.
   The Interior Minister said the violence in El-Minya was fueled
by false rumors a Copt was having an affair with a Moslem woman.
   Moussa said the militants arrested belonged to an organization
calling itself Jihad. This was the extremist group the government
blamed for the assassination of President Anwar Sadat at a military
parade on Oct. 6, 1981, and for a subsequent failed attempt to
overthrow the government. It is not known to be affiliated with the
Lebanon-based group Islamic Jihad, thought to be holding some
Western hostages.
   Jihad has been the target of repeated government crackdowns
since the 1981 incidents.
   Among Egypt's 55 million people there are between 5 million and
6 million Christians, mostly Orthodox Copts, who are followers of
the church established in Egypt by St. Mark.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sponsors of the annual Cherry Blossom Festival
on Monday expressed optimism that unseasonably warm weather hitting
the nation's capital will not cause the trees to bloom too early
for the celebration.
   ``Even though the weather forecasts are good _ drat it _ and the
cherry blossoms look like they may come out early, we're still
hopeful,'' National Park Service spokesman Al Dale said.
   April 1 is the scheduled start of the 78th annual festival
commemorating the gift of the 3,000 trees to the United States by
the mayor of Tokyo in 1912. Temperatures ranging from the mid 60s
to the upper 80s are expected for the rest of the week.
   The earliest the trees have ever blossomed was March 20. But
forecasters say it could be even earlier this year. The delicate
pink and white blossoms last four to five days after they peak.
   ``If things go according to our estimates, by April 1, the
program may just be the Japanese Tree Festival, because the
blossoms will have come and gone,'' National Weather Service
meteorologist Jim Belleville said.
   About 1,300 of the trees ring the Tidal Basin between the
Lincoln and Jefferson memorials, with the rest planted on nearby
park land.
   Forecasters said there was still hope that the cooling effect of
the nearby Potomac River could slow down blossom development.
``Temperatures near water are always lower than those farther away
from water,'' Belleville said.
   But he said any slowdown caused by the Potomac waters would be
short-lived.
   National Park Service spokesman Earle Kittleman said that if the
blossoms of the Yoshino, or single-blossom trees make an early
debut, all would not be lost, because there were at least 400
double-flowering, or Kwanzan, trees that would bloom later than the
Yoshino trees.

<HEAD>20 Dead in Factional Fighting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY RENFREW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black factional fighting and
other confrontations between activists and authorities have killed
20 blacks and wounded six police, officials said Monday.
   Zulu leader Mangosothu Buthelezi, whose supporters have been
involved in some of the worst fighting, said he favors turning
South Africa into a federation of states to take into account
ethnic differences. Buthelezi said in an interview that he opposes
any plans to nationalize the economy.
   The anti-apartheid United Democractic Front said 89 activists
were detained without charge last week under state of emergency
regulations. Only a handful of people had been in detention until
the widespread violence erupted last month.
   Thirteen people were killed in unrest this weekend in
Buthelezi's KwaZulu homeland, in the southeast, police said. The
dead included a woman and her four children who burned to death
when their hut was set on fire. Police gave no additional details.
   Police said Monday they found the bodies of three black men who
were stoned and burned in the KwaGuqa township east of Johannesburg.
   Also, three blacks were killed Sunday in fighting between rival
factions in black townships in various parts of the country and a
fourth man was killed by police gunfire.
   In Cape Town, about 50 people peacefully protesting rising food
prices were arrested, witnesses said. The march was organized by
the National Unemployed Workers Coordinating Committee.
   A police statement reported unrest in various areas, with police
patrols using shotguns, pistols, rubber bullets and tear gas to
disperse crowds to halt faction fighting.
   South Africa has been hit by a wave of violence seen as the most
serious unrest since the mid-1980s. More than 200 people have been
killed in unrest in the past four weeks in fighting over issues
ranging from tribal rivalry to struggles between gangs for control
of various townships.
   Some of the worst fighting was in the black township of
Katlehong outside Johannesburg, where at least 24 people have been
killed during the past week in clashes that began in a struggle
between rival taxi companies.
   About 1,000 men went on a rampage in the area Sunday night,
chasing people from their homes after a hostel was firebombed,
according to the South African Press Association. Police reported
several vehciles and buildings were burned and at least one man
suffered serious stab wounds.
   Residents of some townships have called for deployment of army
troops to halt factional fighing, although removal of troops from
black townships has been a standing demand of anti-apartheid
organizations since a national state of emergency was declared June
12, 1986.
   In an interview with the South African Press Association,
Buthelezi said he was willing to consider the African National
Congress' plan for full democracy with no racial barriers in South
Africa. But the leader of the Zulu Inkatha political movement said
he still prefers his previously stated plan for dividing the
country into separate ethnic-based entities to avoid racial
friction.
   ``One cannot ignore the multinational character of South
Africa,'' he was quoted as saying.
   ``I believe a federation of states would accommodate all
interests. However I am not locked into this idea to the extent
that I am not prepared to explode the ANC's idea of a unitary
state,'' he added.
   Inkatha is a major political movement representing South
Africa's large Zulu tribe. It opposes apartheid, but is more
conservative than the ANC and some other black nationalist groups.
   Buthelezi said he was totally opposed to any plans to end South
Africa's free market economy. He said black African states that
adopted socialist economic systems experienced major problems and
were not switching back to free enterprise.
   But the ANC, which favors nationalizing key sectors of the
economy, had ``studiously ignored'' the experience of other African
states, he said.

   Billy Barty is being sued by a television
writer who says the diminutive actor owes him $2,000 for his help
on the brief-run TV show ``Short Ribbs.''
   Bill Winckler, 25, of suburban Woodland Hills, said the ``little
people'' actor has ignored a contract guaranteeing him pay for each
script plus a percentage of syndication profits. The show ran from
September to December.
   Barty, 65, who has starred in such films as ``Willow'' and
``Rumpelstiltskin,'' was out of town Monday and was unavailable for
comment, said his sister, Evelyn Barty, from the Billy Barty
Foundation, which helps raise money for scholarships for people of
small stature.
   The small claims case was scheduled to be heard March 19 in Van
Nuys Municipal Court.
   Winckler said he agreed to work for $100 a script because he
also was promised 10 percent of the syndication profits, which
could turn a large profit for him if successful.
   ``I'll be bringing my copy of the contract to court, which means
it should be an open and shut case,'' Winckler said.
   Winckler said he doesn't know why Barty refused to pay him,
saying only that ``creative differences'' had caused friction
between the two men.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration said Monday it is
willing to deal with Lithuania as an independent state if it can
negotiate a full transfer of power from the Soviet Union and take
charge of its own destiny.
   Weaving a delicate balance betweeen the national aspirations of
the Lithuanian people and the shaky political posture of Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, administration officials stopped
short of official recognition of Lithuania's new move toward
independent government.
   ``We believe this is the right measure of support,'' said White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. ``It reflects our policy of many
years of not recognizing their incorporation (into the Soviet
Union) in the first place.''
   Fitzwater and Margaret Tutwiler, spokeswoman for the State
Department, made clear that Lithuania's declaration of independence
is only a first step. There is much to be done before the Baltic
state becomes independent in fact and formal U.S. ties are
established, they said.
   Ms. Tutwiler said, however, that prompted by the unanimous
declaration of independence voted Sunday by the Lithuanian
parliament, the United States ``will expand the range of our
contacts with freely elected representatives and officials of the
Baltic States as appropriate.''
   But she and Fitzwater also made clear that does not yet extend
to an exchange of ambassadors or the extension of full diplomatic
recognitiion.
   The administration's policy, Fitzwater said, ``reflects the fact
that they still have negotiations to carry out that we want to be
successful. ... But we aren't going to try to dictate the eventual
outcome.''
   Fitzwater said: ``... We would want any recognition to take into
account a final government that was in control of their own
destiny, and much of that has yet to be negotiated with the Soviet
Union.''
   The United States recognized the independence of a Lithuanian
state in 1922. It has never recognized its forced incorporation
into the Soviet Union in 1940.
   Nonetheless, Ms. Tutwiler said that over the years it has been
U.S. practice ``to establish formal relations with the lawful
government of any state once that government is in effective
control of its territory and capable of entering into and
fulfilling international obligations.''
   ``When we are satisfied that the Lithuanian government can meet
these requirements, we will establish formal diplomatic relations
with the new government,'' she said.
   She said such questions as the removal of some 200,000 Soviet
troops from Lithuanian soil is a matter for negotiations between
the Soviets and representatives of Lithuania.
   And Ms. Tutwiler said she would not spell out precisely what
specific steps would have to be taken before the United States
would recognize Lithuania's full sovereignty.
   Gorbachev, opening a congress of Communist Party deputies in
Moscow on Monday, called Lithuania's declaration of independence
``alarming.''
   But he gave no sign that action will be taken to prevent
Lithuania and the other Baltic republics from seceding.
   Gorbachev had previously placed a $34 billion pricetag on
Lithuanian independence, saying an independent Lithuania would have
to pay for the factories, roads and other physical improvements
made during a half-century of Soviet rule.
   But Lithuanians say they have a much larger bill to present for
five decades of Soviet repression _ including mass deportations to
Siberia under Joseph Stalin.

<HEAD>Hurd: Britain's Main Concern Is NATO</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's foreign secretary said
Monday that protecting NATO is his main concern as German
unification proceeds, but there also will be ``tough discussions''
on how to incorporate what is now East Germany into the EEC.
   Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd made the remarks two days before
the preliminary round of the ``two-plus-four'' unification talks of
the two German nations and the four World War II allies _ the
United States, the Soviet Union, France and Britain.
   Hurd was in Bonn for discussions with Chancellor Helmut Kohl
about his game plan for unification. He also met with Foreign
Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher.
   The West German government announced, meanwhile, that Kohl would
be meeting with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on March
30.
   Hurd said that in his talks with Kohl and Genscher, they
discussed ``virtually every aspect of German unification,''
including the Polish border issue, NATO, and the European Economic
Community.
   ``Mr. Genscher assured me it is the wish of the federal
government that these external aspects should be settled _ there
should be agreement on them _ before unification takes place,''
said Hurd.
   He praised Kohl's reversal of his earlier refusal to say
unequivocally that a united Germany would have no designs on land
ceded to Poland after the Third Reich's defeat in 1945. He also
insisted the Poles have a right to participate in discussions about
their borders.
   Poland is demanding it be included in the reunification talks,
but West Germany has rejected that idea.
   ``Certainly the Poles should take part in any discussion which
affects their frontiers,'' Hurd said, without specifying if he
believes Poland should be a full participant in the talks.
   Hurd underscored that Britain supports German unification, and
said London merely has been insisting that the ``external aspects''
of unification be fully discussed. He said Britain's foremost
concern is protecting the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   ``Our main concern is with the future of the North Atlantic
alliance, and the crucial importance for that alliance, and for the
security of Europe, of continued German membership of NATO,'' Hurd
said.
   The Soviet Union has insisted a united Germany cannot be a NATO
member. As a compromise, Genscher has proposed keeping NATO troops
off what East German territory, an idea backed by the United States
but rejected by the Soviets.
   Hurd said he and his West German hosts talked about the problem
and were ``quite close on this.''
   He also said that incorporating what is now East Germany into
the European Economic Community came up as well. ``I foresee a
tough but technical series of discussions (within the EEC) on the
Community aspect,'' he said.
   ``The sooner East Germany can be brought into the Community
framework, into a NATO framework, the better we'll be pleased,'' he
said.
   Four U.S. senators met with Kohl Monday. Sen. Richard G. Lugar,
R-Ind., said the chancellor had ``asked for U.S. understanding''
about the accelerated pace of German unification. Lugar is head of
the Senate Arms Control Observer Group.

   An investigation began Monday into an
explosion that killed three workers inside an empty oil storage
tank.
   The victims were renovating the 80,000-barrel tank on Sunday
when a piece of equipment apparently touched off vapors that had
built up inside, causing the explosion, Webster Parish coroner's
investigator T.C. Bloxom said.
   The blast was strong enough to blow the top off the tank, ``and
that's one of the biggest tanks on the premises,'' Bloxom said.
   The refinery is run by the Kerr-McGee Refining and Crude Oil
Hauling Corp., whose investigators were joined by federal and state
inspectors Monday. Authorities said the three killed were working
for a subcontractor, Baker Tank of Arp, Texas.
   The vapor buildup occurred in spite of a ventilating fan. Bloxom
said the victims' bodies were found near the fan.
   The men apparently died instantly, sheriff's Deputy Charlie
Horton said. He said a fourth worker had just left the tank to get
tools and was not hurt.
   Residents near the refinery on Louisiana Highway 7 said they
heard a sound like thunder, looked out and saw fire and smoke.
   Kerr-McGee employees had the flash fire out by the time fire
crews from the nearby town of Minden arrived, but it was three
hours before rescuers wearing protective clothing and breathing
gear could be lowered into the tankto recover the charred bodies,
Bloxom said.
   The victims were identified as James Christopher Doyle, 22, of
Longview, Texas; Steve Gurado Vega, 24, of Tyler, Texas; and Ricky
Martin, 37, of Jacksonville, Texas.
   The explosion was the second at the refinery in eight years.
Four men were injured, two seriously, and residents were evacuated
after a series of explosions in May 1982.

<HEAD>Soviets Got $481 Million in U.S. Wheat Subsidy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. subsidies on wheat sold to the Soviet
Union were worth $481 million over 29 months, the General
Accounting Office reported.
   The Soviet Union got the benefit of lower prices from the
largest amount that the U.S. government spent on shipments to any
one country. The subsidies are collected by U.S. exporting
companies, which then ship to foreign buyers at less than market
prices.
   The object is to help sell U.S. farm products in competition
with subsidies by governments of other producer countries trying to
help their own farmers. The program is aimed especially at
competition from the 12 countries of the European Economic
Community, where France and West Germany are big exporters of wheat.
   Wheat is the major item under what the federal government calls
its Export Enhancement Program, but subsidies are also paid on a
variety of products from eggs to milk cows.
   Detailed figures in the report, made available recently, cover
Oct. 1, 1986, through Feb. 28, 1989. During that period, the total
subsidies to all exporters amounted to $2.3 billion. Total sales of
U.S. products helped by the subsidies were $6.8 billion, of which
$5.5 billion was for sales of wheat.
   Five countries were the biggest wheat buyers under the program:
the Soviet Union, China, Algeria, Egypt and Morocco.
   Critics say the subsidized sales discourage those governments
from paying better prices to their own farmers, and that the bread
from the wheat is so cheap that some feed it to animals.
   The Agriculture Department put the total cost of the subsidies
up to last week at $2.7 billion since the program began in 1985. It
said later detailed figures for the Soviet Union and other
individual countries were confidential.
   ``It's largely a pass-through operation to help U.S. farmers,''
said Rob Johnson, vice president for public affairs of Cargill Inc.
``Our commissions have averaged less than one-half of one percent
of sales.''
   Cargill, one of the world's biggest grain dealers, collected the
largest amount in subsidies: $444.9 million.
   How much of that was profit is impossible to estimate, said
Allen I. Mendelowitz, director of international trade and finance
issues at the GAO. His report was submitted to Rep. Kika de la
Garza, D-Tex., chairman of the House Agriculture Commitee.
   Mendelowitz said Cargill's earnings come not only from
commissions but also depend on the prices it paid U.S. farmers,
which may have been higher than the prices it received in Moscow,
as well as on the subsidies it received from the U.S. government.
   Those subsidies are paid in the form of surplus farm products
already owned by the government.
   Egypt was the second biggest beneficiary under the U.S. program,
which paid U.S. dealers $311.8 million in such commodities to help
exports there. Egypt got frozen poultry, dairy cattle and semolina,
too, but wheat and wheat flour were much the biggest items.
   China received some cattle, but mostly wheat. Subsidies for
shipments there totaled $299.5 million.
   Algeria, a major wheat producer, also got mainly wheat from the
United States. The bonuses on exports there were worth $206.9
million, including some for barley, semolina and vegetable oil.
   The GAO is Congress' watchdog agency on government spending.

<HEAD>Freud Psychiatry Clinic Entitled to Quarter of Monroe's Estate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An English psychiatric center founded by Sigmund
Freud's daughter is entitled to one-fourth of Marilyn Monroe's
estate, a judge ruled Monday.
   Miss Monroe had left the share, estimated to be worth millions
of dollars, to her psychiatrist, who died in 1980.
   Manhattan Surrogate Marie Lambert decided that the psychiatrist,
Dr. Marianne Kris, had the right to bequeath her share of Monroe's
estate to the Anna Freud Centre for the Psychoanalytic Study and
Treatment of Children in London.
   Miss Monroe, who starred in such movies as ``Bus Stop,''
``Gentlemen Prefer Blondes,'' ``The Seven-Year Itch'' and ``Some
Like It Hot,'' died in 1962 from an overdose of drugs and alcohol.
   In a three-page will dated Jan. 14, 1961, Miss Monroe left the
rest of her estate to her acting coach, Lee Strasberg.
   Strasberg's widow, Anna, was appointed in July as administrator
of Miss Monroe's estate after the original executor's death earlier
in the year. Mrs. Strasberg challenged the psychiatric center's
right to the money, saying Kris' rights to the estate ended when
she died.
   Kris reportedly never collected any proceeds from Miss Monroe's
estate. But in her own will, she left her share to the Hampstead
Child Therapy Clinic, renamed for its founder, Anna Freud.
   Had Lambert ruled in Mrs. Strasberg's favor, Kris' share would
have gone to Strasberg's estate. But Lambert noted that Mrs.
Strasberg had said she would donate the disputed share to charity.
   Bernard Green, lawyer for the center, said it is impossible to
say exactly what the estate is worth, but added, ``It's not an
insubstantial amount.''

   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole on Monday
warned President Bush of a political backlash from voters unless
the administration speeds up work on the savings and loan bailout.
   ``This thing could be an albatross in 1992 ... which happens to
be an election year,'' the Kansas Republican said. ``I think George
Bush has some interest in staying on.''
   The Resolution Trust Corp., the new agency created to dispose of
failed thrifts, has sold only 50 of the more than 380 S&amp;Ls under
government control and ``is not living up to expectations,'' Dole
said.
   He said the delay is driving up the cost of the bailout,
estimated at $160 billion over 10 years.
   ``We've got to get this thing going... I've got a feeling this
thing is going to get out of hand one of these days and the
American people are going to start saying, `What are you doing
about it?''' he told a meeting of the National Association of
Federal Credit Unions.
   The Republican leader said the administration must fill vacant
positions in the savings and loan bureaucracy and resolve an
apparent turf battle between the Resolution Trust Corp. and a
Treasury Department-led oversight board.
   And Congress must ``go back and take a look'' at S&amp;L legislation
``if not this year, then early next year,'' he said. The chairmen
of both the House and Senate banking committees say they oppose
revising the law this year.
   But Dole said the S&amp;L law contributes to what he called a
sluggishness that is gripping the bureaucracy by establishing
conflicting guidelines.
   Congress ordered the administration to dispose of property from
S&amp;Ls quickly but avoid dumping property on the market. It said the
government should get the highest price for the assets but offer
low-income groups the first chance to buy some of the property.
   As a result, ``the RTC is timid,'' Dole said. ``They're afraid
of Congress. They're afraid of public hearings. They don't want to
do anything innovative.''
   ``We (in Congress) are trying to have it both ways,'' he said.
``... Keep this in mind because, a year from now, nobody in
Congress is going to tell you we did that. They're going to blame
the administration.''
   Dole said he's sounded his warning in a conversation with the
president, in a letter to Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and
in a meeting last week with White House Chief of Staff John Sununu.

<HEAD>Transit Officials Don't Like Transportation Policy, But Still Like
Author</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Transit officials passed a resolution Monday
condemning a federal transportation policy they said could put some
of them out business, but praised its author, Transportation
Secretary Samuel Skinner.
   The American Public Transit Association, which includes transit
officials and suppliers from around the country, urged a 7
cents-a-gallon federal gas tax increase for mass transit and said
Skinner's policy ``fails to set clear, meaningful goals for
increased transit use.''
   The resolution was approved on a unanimous voice vote by about
500 participants.
   However, several officials said they still had faith in Skinner,
whose policy was unveiled at the White House last week, and believe
he will fight for their goals even though his policy doesn't.
   ``I've lost no confidence in Sam Skinner at all,'' said Rod
Diridon, chairman of California's Santa Clara County Transportation
Agency. He blamed the policy's shortcomings on changes made by the
White House's Office of Management and Budget and Chief of Staff
John Sununu.
   Dan Scannell of New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority
said he expected Skinner, who formerly headed the Chicago area
transit system, to fight ``for the principles that should be
embraced.''
   William Millar, manager of Pittsburgh's transit system, said the
industry trusts Skinner and the people who work for him.
   ``All of us have a boss,'' he said, referring to the fact that
Skinner works for President Bush, who has pledged not to raise
taxes. ``The boss may be saying something different from what any
of us may want to do.''
   Millar said, however, the policy that would shift more
responsibility to local governments and decrease federal support
for mass transit, could put people out of work and make it so
others can't get to work.
   Hershel R. Payne, head of transportation for Fort Worth, Texas,
said the ``increased flexibility'' the policy would give local
governments would mean a reduction in federal assistance.
   ``It would hit every transportation system in the country, from
the smallest to the largest,'' Payne said. ``Many systems may even
have to close down'' and fares in others could go up 25 percent.
   Neil Peterson, Los Angeles County Transportation Commission
director, said the proposals would restrict development of a new
transit system in the county and mean even more congested freeways.
   He predicted the congestion would lower the average speed, which
now is only 37 mph, to 17 mph in 20 years.
   Vicki Shaffer, who runs the 25-bus system in Huntington, W.Va.,
said her 50-employee operation could not have started without
federal help.
   ``The policy says to us, `Forget it,''' she said. ``If you
cannot put your money where your mouth is, don't tell me you have a
policy.''

<HEAD>Administration Presses Israelis For Reply On Proposal For Talks</HEAD>

   The Bush administration pressed the Israeli
government Monday to overcome its indecision about a U.S. plan for
negotiations with Palestinian Arabs and to approve a formula put
together by Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   ``We are waiting for an answer from the Israeli government,''
State Department spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler said. ``When the
answer comes back, then we will know how to proceed.''
   While Baker kept his distance, lower-level U.S. diplomats were
in touch with Israeli officials. There was no immediate word on
whether Baker would soften any of the terms to accommodate Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir and other members of the conservative Likud
coalition.
   ``I would hate to say anything is locked in concrete,'' Ms.
Tutwiler said. ``We are in a negotiations.''
   Shamir and his supporters objected to the inclusion in the
delegation of Cairo talks Palestinians with a residence in East
Jerusalem or deported from the West Bank.
   The provision, inserted by Baker in deference to Egypt and the
Palestine Liberation Organization, appeared to challenge Israel's
retention of the predominantly Arab part of Jerusalem as well as
handling of a Palestinian rebellion on the West Bank and in Gaza.
   A statement by President Bush calling East Jerusalem and the
West Bank off-limits to Jewish ``settlers'' also irritated Shamir.
   On Sunday, the prime minister refused to put Baker's plan to a
vote before the 12-member Israeli inner cabinet. The inaction
raised the prospect of a government crisis in Jerusalem and
abandonment by Baker of his eight-month effort to launch
negotiations.
   Shimon Peres, leader of the opposition Labor party, accused
Shamir on Monday of leaving Israel in a ``desert of indecision.''
   White House and State Department officials said the Bush
administration would not give up in seeking approval of the Baker
plan.
   ``The process is still continuing. We're still talking and we're
still hopeful,'' Marlin Fitzwater, the White House press secretary,
said.
   Asked if Bush's comments on East Jerusalem had set the talks
back, Fitzwater replied: ``No. The process of peace talks is a long
and arduous one. There have been stops and starts, and it's still
continuing and we just continue to watch the process and be
supportive as we can.''
   State Department spokeswoman Tutwiler said, meanwhile, the sole
U.S. objective in promoting Israeli-Palestinian talks was to help
Israel implement its own plan for elections on the West Bank and
Gaza.
   ``What we are looking for is agreement on moving towards
peace,'' she said.
   Meanwhile, Thomas A. Dine, executive director of the American
Israel Public Affairs Committee, accused the Bush administration in
a speech Sunday night of ``a new American tilt'' that had caused
the PLO to rejoice and brought unhappiness to Likud and Labor
circles in Israel.
   Dine criticized Bush's statement on Jerusalem and testimony by
Baker and John Kelly, the assistant secretary of state for the Near
East, crediting PLO chairman Yasser Arafat with honoring his
renunciation of terrorism.
   ``Settlements on the West Bank are a matter on which Israelis
themselves, and our community here, are divided,'' Dine said.
``Some favor them, and others are opposed. But the right of Jews to
live anywhere in Jerusalem ... has never before been questioned by
any American president, certainly not publicly.''

   A strong earthquake struck the north
Pacific on Monday, and was felt 110 miles away in the Aleutian
Island town of Adak.
   There are no reports of damage or injury.
   The quake had a preliminary strength of 6.2 on the Richter
scale, said Alec Medberry at the Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer.
   It was not strong enough to generate a tsunami, or tidal wave,
he added.
   The quake struck at 5:41 a.m. AST and was centered about 110
miles southeast of Adak.
   Medberry said it was also felt in the Aleutian Island town of
Atka, about 100 miles away.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one means a tenfold increase in
magnitude.
   An earthquake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage.

   A high school sophomore who would
have celebrated his 16th birthday Monday died after being shot in
the face by a 14-year-old friend as they were playing with guns,
police said.
   Chad MacDonald died at Baystate Medical Center on Sunday, a day
after the shooting at his home in this Springfield suburb.
   His parents said the boy had taken the loaded weapons _ a 9mm
semiautomatic pistol and a .357-caliber Magnum revolver _ to his
room without their permission because he had been frightened by an
older boy.
   West Springfield High School Principal George F. Bauman
described Chad as ``your everyday high school student.''
   ``He was an average student, who didn't stand out above the
rest, but at the same time had not been in any difficulty,'' Bauman
said Monday.
   As an 8-year-old, Chad received a National Heroism Award from
the Boy Scouts of America for summoning help for his mother when
she suffered collapsed lungs.
   The principal said counselors and nurses were being made
available to distraught students. ``We are trying to help the
students and the family get through this crisis with as little
scarring as possible,'' he said.
   Police Capt. Thomas Burke declined to release the name of the
14-year-old charged, because of his age.
   The youth was arraigned Monday in Springfield Juvenile Court on
charges of delinquency by reasons of murder and of possession of a
firearm with no identification, said Clerk Magistrate Marc
Katsoulis.
   Witnesses said the youth tremble at the closed hearing as an
automatic plea of innocent was entered. The case was continued to
April 2 and the youth was released to his parents' custody.
   Burke said police also were looking into how the boys came to
have the guns, which belonged to Chad's father and were licensed.
   ``This is a very careless, negligent, tragic act, especially
with young kids,'' Burke said. ``Guns should be stored in a locked
place, with ammunition kept in a separate locked place.''
   Burke said the 14-year-old, who was sleeping over as the family
was preparing for Chad's birthday party, told authorities he took
the 9mm semiautomatic from a dresser and fired at Chad after Chad
had pointed the Magnum at him and said ``bang.''
   Chad's parents said their son had taken the two loaded weapons
and put them in his room without their knowledge.
   Debra MacDonald said her son had been repeatedly harassed by an
older youth, and she and her husband had filed several complaints
with police.
   Her husband, Glenn, said the family did not harbor any
ill-feelings toward the 14-year-old boy.
   ``He is destroyed,'' the father said. ``He has to live with this
the rest of his life.''

   Taking ukuleles to Hawaii
sounds about as misplaced as shipping coals to Newcastle.
   But that's what 25 Vancouver-area students, aged 9 to 19, are
doing this week.
   ``Even though the ukulele is the key instrument in their society
_ it's as Hawaiian as the grass skirt _ the school authorities over
there want to learn the Canadian teaching methods we use which are
so successful,'' said Peter Luongo, vice principal and music
specialist at Alice Brown elementary.
   The school has become so skilled at teaching the four-stringed,
guitarlike instrument that word has reached Hawaii.
   The ukulele, introduced from Portugal into the Hawaiian Islands
about 1879, was first used in Canadian schools in the Maritime
provinces about 20 years ago to teach music, he said.
   ``It came to Langley about 15 years ago and we got some really
keen kids,'' he said. ``I picked up the program when I came here
and developed a senior honors group.''
   The students have played in concerts across Canada and will pay
for most of the 10-day trip beginning Thursday.
   ``We will be given a lot of hospitality but we'll be going to
schools that are very meager compared to ours and I think our
students will learn a lot about the other side of Hawaii _ it's not
all plush hotels,'' Luongo said.

   Marleen Suess wanted an undergraduate degree,
and knew it was just a matter of finding the time.
   Ms. Suess, an accounts supervisor for H.J. Heinz Co., expects to
graduate from Robert Morris College in 1992, just 12 years and 29
semesters after enrolling.
   ``I'm on the 12-year plan,'' said Ms. Suess, 40, of Dorseyville.
``When I started, I knew I would definitely finish no matter how
long it would take.''
   She now has 90 credits and a 3.67 grade point average.
   Ms. Suess said she returned to college to advance her career.
After her divorce, she said, ``I knew I had to take care of
myself.''
   She initially was afraid she would be unable to juggle her job,
schoolwork and housework. ``Now I realize that's silly. You can
always find the time,'' she said.

   Two dozen students discovered that being
a parent to an egg can really scramble your life.
   Third-grade teacher Charla Easley gave her students at Ima Dell
Fitzgerald Elementary School hard-boiled eggs to name, clothe and
nurture for one week as a firsthand lesson about the
responsibilities of parenthood.
   The students were given $100 in play money with which they could
pay to leave their eggs in day care _ at the back of the classroom
_ if they wanted some free time. Overnight care was available at
$10 a night.
   The ``eggs-perience'' was eye-opening, the students said.
   The high cost of day care forced Espie Randolph to take his
``daughter,'' Jessica, everywhere, he said.
   ``She really got on my nerves,'' Espie said. ``I had to take her
to the park, to the mall, and even on the bus.''
   ``I thought raising a kid would be a lot easier,'' said
9-year-old John Moffett.
   Moffett said he is glad the shell game is over and has plans for
his triplets.
   ``I'm going to throw them in the trash compactor,'' he said.

   Using her arms to drag her small body up the
Capitol steps, 8-year-old Jennifer Keelan joined some 60 disabled
Americans Monday in lobbying for legislation to guarantee their
civil rights.
   ``I'll take all night if I have to,'' Jennifer said to others
crawling alongside her. She paused just past the halfway point for
a sip of water on a bright and unseasonably hot March day, then
resumed pulling herself along the rest of the 83 marble steps.
   Keelan, a blond-haired second grader from Denver, was the
youngest of about 60 people with disabilities who left their
wheelchairs and crawled up the West Front of the Capitol.
   They were making a symbolic protest to demand passage of a key
bill now pending in the House that would extend civil rights to
disabled persons.
   She and the others climbed the Capitol steps after about 1,000
people walked or rode in wheelchairs down Pennsylvania Avenue from
the White House to the Capitol and held a rally at the base of the
Capitol steps.
   The were demanding passage of the Americans with Disabilities
Act, which passed the Senate last year but has been bogged down in
the House this year, despite widespread predictions of its ultimate
passage.
   The measure would outlaw discrimination based on physical or
mental disability in employment, access to buildings, use of the
telephone system, use of public and private transportation systems,
and in other areas.
   Although the bill has the support of the Bush administration and
congressional leaders, some supporters have begun questioning the
administration's commitment in recent weeks. At the White House,
Bush press secretary Marlin Fitzwater denied that the support was
slipping and said the administration was negotiating over the bill
with key members of Congress.
   ``We do support the legislation,'' Fitzwater said. ``We're very
supportive of their rights and their cause. President Bush has
spoken out on that in the past.''
   Rep. Pat Schroeder, D-Colo., a supporter of the bill, told the
rally that pressure was building for the bill and that the House
Energy and Commerce Committee had scheduled its vote on the measure
for Tuesday as a result.
   The protesters wore signs demanding passage of the bill, without
weakening amendments.
   They represented people with all sorts of disabilities _ people
in wheelchairs, people speaking in sign language, people with
seeing-eye dogs. Among those at the rally were James Brady, the
former White House press secretary who was shot in head during the
attack on President Reagan in 1981.
   I. King Jordan, president of Galludet University and the first
deaf person to hold that position at the school for the hearing
impaired, said: ``We're not asking for any favors. We're simply
asking the same rights and equality any other American has.''
   Jennifer Keelan and the other demonstrators began crawling up
the steps to the Capitol as soon as the speeches ended. Unable to
move any other way, some rolled on their side to cover the concrete
spaces between the five flights of steps.
   As Jennifer crawled, her mother, Cynthia Keelan, stood watching
in the shade. She said Jennifer suffers cerebral palsy. She said
her daughter decided to crawl the steps herself, after joining the
group Americans Disabled for Accessible Public Transit and becoming
friends with its members, adults and children.
   A young friend of hers in that group, 5-year-old Kenny Perkins
of Denver, died in January. ``I'm doing it for Kenny,'' Jennifer
said as she reached the top.''
   ``I'm proud of her,'' her mother said. ``That was hard work.''

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev's plan for a powerful
presidency to hold the Soviet Union together ran into a wall of
opposition Monday, one day after Lithuania fractured the union by
declaring its independence.
   Parliamentarians from other independence-minded republics took
the floor of the Congress of People's Deputies to assail the
proposed presidency as far too strong for the loose federation of
sovereign countries they envision as the future Soviet Union.
   ``The fact that the U.S.S.R. is a union of sovereign states is
hardly taken into account,'' said Givi Gumbaridze, Communist Party
chief of the southern republic of Georgia, where the parliament
voted Friday to reject the presidency proposal and to demand
immediate negotiations with Moscow on independence.
   ``This draft does not give enough consideration to the sad
traditions of our state,'' he said, referring to decades of
dictatorship and its terrible toll of mass murder.
   Lithuanians were so dismayed by Gorbachev's proposed
strengthening of the presidency that they rushed to declare
independence before it passed.
   ``Tomorrow, Mr. Gorbachev will get dictatorial powers with the
right to overrun any republican parliament,'' said Algimantas
Chekuolis, a Lithuanian who with his republic's declaration of
independence now describes himself as a former member of the Soviet
Congress, attending as an observer.
   As Gorbachev opened the session, he called the Lithuanian action
``alarming'' without ever mentioning the word independence. He
suggested that the government study what is happening and prepare a
reaction.
   Another member of the ruling Communist Party Politburo, Yegor K.
Ligachev, said Moscow would not use force in Lithuania.
   Progressive Moscow deputy Alexei Yablokov said legislators from
Georgia, Moldavia, Azerbaijan, Estonia and Latvia are expected to
boycott Tuesday's vote on the constitutional amendment, which could
fail for lack of the required two-thirds majority. All five of
those republics are possible candidates for following the
Lithuanians into secession.
   But throughout the day, deputies huddled with Gorbachev and each
other seeking compromises.
   At one point, Estonian President Arnold Ruutel, Gorbachev and
Gorbachev's aide Georgi Shakhnazarov pulled up chairs behind the
dais and Ruutel earnestly pitched a deal to the Soviet leader.
Ruutel told reporters Estonia was seeking assurances that Gorbachev
would negotiate the Baltic state's future relationship with Moscow,
but he refused to say if the Estonians would trade that promise for
their votes on the presidency.
   Also on the agenda of the special session of Congress were
constitutional amendments to end the Communist Party's monopoly on
power and substitute a multiparty political system, and to allow
individuals to own factories and lease land.
   Another draft amendment would ban any party or organization
whose goal is violent overthrow of the constitutional structure or
the socialist state.
   If the presidency proposal is approved Tuesday, deputies will
then nominate and elect someone to the job, possibly the same day.
Gorbachev is the only candidate whose name has been mentioned thus
far and he is expected to win, said progressive deputy Sergei
Stankevich.
   Gorbachev has said the new powers are needed so the Soviet Union
won't fall into a ethnic and nationalist violence that could
threaten his campaign for democratization and reform. The Supreme
Soviet, an arm of the Congress that functions as the working
legislature, voted overwhelmingly to support the proposal Feb. 27.
   Soviet Vice President Anatoly Lukyanov introduced the latest
draft of the presidency proposal Monday by promising: ``There is no
reason to believe that the institution of the presidency would lead
to alleged authoritarian power.''
   Lukyanov said the bill creates checks and balances between the
executive and legislative branches of power. He said the Congress
may recall the president for violating laws or the constitution,
but only the Congress and the Supreme Soviet may pass laws.
   The current Constitution still allows the Presidium, headed by
Gorbachev, to issue decrees.
   Progressive deputy Anatoly Sobchak said a tentative compromise
had been reached on the most controversial point allowing the
president to declare a state of emergency, suspend the parliament
of a republic and take over its administration. It would require
him to obtain permission from the republic or the national
parliament, he said at a news conference.
   Gorbachev supporter Sergei Alexeyev argued the Soviet Union is
``in a paralysis of power,'' and ``the presidency is the only way
to transfer the real power from the party to the government.''
   If the presidency issue is resolved positively, ``we can get
down to drafting a new constitution immediately which will confirm
human rights, democracy and conversion to a market economy,''
Alexeyev said.
   But Vitaly Vorotnikov, president of the Russian Federation,
alarmed deputies from the smaller republics when he said the
country needed a president ``to ensure strict compliance with all
the laws of the union.''
   Several of the independence-oriented republics have adopted
constitutional amendments allowing them to suspend Soviet laws on
their territory.
   The constitutional amendment requires a two-thirds majority, or
1,500 of the 2,250 members of the Congress. A close vote could
force Gorbachev into a difficult choice: recognize that the
Lithuanians are no longer members of Congress, thus lowering the
needed margin to 1,462 votes out of 2,192, or risk losing the vote.
   Yuri Afanasyev, a leader of a group of progressive deputies,
urged the presidency be adopted only in conjunction with a new
constitution, direct election of the president, real opposition
parties, freedom of the press and a new union treaty.
   He angered many of the deputies by attacking Soviet founder
Vladimir Lenin.
   ``The use of force and violence is our entire history. If our
leader and founder laid the foundation of anything, it was the
institution of mass violence and state terror,'' he said. Deputies
shouted their anger.
   Afanasyev, a historian, said later he was proud of the statement
even though it undoubtedly cost the progressives votes.

   At the doors to Lithuania's Supreme
Soviet _ renamed the Supreme Council _ artist Kestutis Balikonis
was touching up the paint Monday under the banner of a medieval
knight that replaced the metal Soviet hammer and sickle torn down
the night before.
   ``In concrete daily life, nothing has changed'' since Lithuania
declared its independence from the Soviet Union on Sunday night, he
said.
   But he added: ``Now we're living in the hope that something will
change.''
   ``We know that at the beginning, things will be harder, but no
one says we shouldn't have done this, even though everyone is a
little concerned,'' Balikonis said.
   In the blustery Lithuanian capital, there were no special signs
of rejoicing Monday, no banner headlines in the newspapers and no
special flags flying or bells ringing. Virtually all the signs of a
half-century of Soviet control remained.
   Only a dozen or so stalwart activists gathered in the rain in
front of the Supreme Council's concrete columns.
   Residents and legislators said the joy over the moves for
independence was overshadowed by trepidation about the possible
consequences and whether Lithuania's new government would make the
right moves.
   In discussions Monday, the Supreme Council turned to thorny
economic issues, including the question of the fate of
Moscow-controlled factories on Lithuanian soil.
   With no direct response from Moscow, members of the 141-seat
Supreme Council drafted a message to President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, asking him to recognize Lithuania's statehood and begin
talks with the republic on restoration of its independence.
   Gorbachev told the Congress of People's Deputies in Moscow that
Lithuania's action was ``alarming,'' but gave no further reaction.
Another member of the ruling Communist Party Politburo, Yegor K.
Ligachev, said the Kremlin would not use force against Lithuania.
   The Soviet leader has told Lithuanian leaders that he will
demand 21 billion rubles _ about $34 billion _ as compensation for
a half-century of investment in Lithuania.
   But Lithuania independence leader Algimantas Chekuolis, also in
Moscow for the Congress, said the republic's bill to Moscow for
damages done during that time was 300 billion rubles _ about $500
billion.
   He said that figure included compensation for 300,000
Lithuanians killed, imprisoned or exiled during Soviet rule, and
for Kremlin-inspired economic failures.
   Earlier in the day, Vytautas Landsbergis, Lithuania's new
president, warned legislators to expect disappointment and
unpleasantness in the near future.
   ``Hope and joy must dissolve into determination to work for
Lithuania. We must work very hard,'' he told the Supreme Council.
   Despite people's fears, Sunday night's decison brought a wave of
euphoria for many.
   Balikonis said a strange man offered him a cigarette and said,
``Can't you already breathe easier?''
   Many parents told their children to ``remember this day of
Lithuania's freedom,'' said council deputy Vidmante Lasukaitete.
   But she added that many people were upset that Algirdas
Brazauskas, the popular Communist Party chief who had served as
president, lost his re-election bid to Landsbergis, a music
professor who led the pro-independence Sajudis movement, at
Sunday's parliamentary session.
   ``People are happy about independence, but would have wanted a
different president,'' Lasukaitete said.
   Kestutis Rimkus, a deputy from rural Lithuania, said his
constituents were concerned that the Supreme Council had rushed its
decision on independence and bringing in a provisional constitution.
   ``No one is thinking now, they're just living by their
emotions,'' he complained.''
   Balchas Saulius, a student at Vilnius Teachers Institute, said
Lithuanians agreed with the traditional Communist saying: ``We have
nothing to lose but our chains.''
   ``It's not important what happens. We are ready for everything,
even being hungry and cold,'' added philosophy professor Stase
Radziuniene.
   They said they expected a restrained political reaction from
Moscow, but also an intense supply blockade and other tough
measures intended to punish Lithuania economically.
   They also expected harassment of 50,000 Lithuanians serving in
the Soviet armed forces by their fellow soldiers, and problems from
Lithuania's minorities _ the Poles, Russians, Jews and others that
make up 20 percent of the republic's 3.7 million people.
   Russians in the port city of Klaipeda have already launched a
petition drive to append their area to the Russian republic, the
activists said.
   Gorbachev has suggested that Klaipeda, a port on the Baltic sea,
may be the subject of a territorial dispute because post World War
II documents do not specifically include it in Lithuania.

   The robbery of a gold merchant by armed
Palestinians in the West Bank town of Nablus on Monday raised fears
that a new gang of self-styled ``enforcers'' has emerged.
   Arab reports said two Palestinian men armed with Israeli-made
Uzi submacine guns entered a shop near the Nablus central market
and robbed the merchant of 11 pounds of gold.
   Last year, a Palestinian gang called the Black Panthers financed
its campaign of assassinations against Arabs suspected of
cooperating with Israel by stealing 17.6 pounds of gold from a
Nablus merchant.
   The Black Panthers went underground in December after gang
leaders were killed in a raid by Israeli troops. They are believed
affiliated with Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction in the PLO.
   Another Nablus gang, known as the Red Eagles and aligned with
the Marxist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, was
smashed by the army in November.
   The robbers Monday were believed to be renegade Fatah members,
Arab reports said. They said both men were wanted by Israeli police
for activities related to the 27-month-old Palestinian uprising
against Israeli rule.
   After the theft, masked Palestinians affiliated with Fatah
marched through the Nablus market and announced over loudspeakers
they would pursue the robbers and try to recover the gold.
   Fatah leaders last fall appealed in vain to the Black Panthers
and the Red Eagles to end their killings of suspected collaborators.
   Also in Nablus on Monday, three masked Palestinians armed with
swords and clubs forced their way into a cosmetics shop owned by
Palestinian businessman Saeed Kanaan and smashed some of his goods.
Kanaan refused to comment on the incident.
   The shop was attacked for a second time that night when four
masked Palestinians smashed the windows and set the store ablaze,
Nablus residents said. They said the shop suffered moderate damage
before firefighters arrived.
   Kanaan, a moderate Palestian leader who supports Fatah, was
threatened by Palestinian radicals after reports were published in
a Hebrew-language daily suggesting that he would be named to a
delegation opening preliminary peace talks with Israel.
   Kanaan later took out advertisements in Arab newspapers denying
the report.
   Also Monday, Palestinian Jamal Muhammed Khalifa, 17, died of
bullet wounds suffered in a stone-throwing clash with Israeli
soldiers Sunday night in the Akhbat Jaber refugee camp in Jericho,
hospital officials said.
   The army confirmed the death and said soldiers opened fired when
attacked by a group of masked youths.
   His death raised to 663 the number of Palestinians killed by
Israelis during the uprising. Another 196 Palestinians have been
killed by fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of collaborating with
Israel, and 43 Israelis have died.

   Dozens of cars and trucks piled up and
burned in a chain-reaction collision on a downtown freeway bridge
in fog so thick it cut visibility to zero. Three people were
killed, authorities said.
   ``It was just horrible, terrible. To hear the brakes squeal, the
gas tanks explode, to hear the people screaming,'' said Harry
Suppanz, 35, of Sturgeon Bay, a passenger in a truck that crashed
and burned.
   At least 30 people were injured and taken to hospitals.
   Police Lt. Roy Johnson described the situation as ``total
chaos'' after the crash on the northbound lanes of the Interstate
43 bridge over the Fox River.
   He said visibility was ``just about down to zero'' when the
accident occurred shortly before 7 a.m. Authorities said 45
vehicles were involved.
   By afternoon, investigators were still trying to determine the
sequence of events that started the pileup, said Police Inspector
Jim Taylor.
   ``It is absolutely amazing. I couldn't believe it when I saw
only three did die,'' said Brown County Coroner Genie Williams.
``It was amazing that many people got out.''
   Police Capt. Larry Gille said a fuel tanker truck involved in
the crash did not burn, but a number of vehicles did. ``It looks
like it was exploding gas tanks from cars'' that caused the fire,
he said.
   Suppanz and Dan Lauder, 31, of Sturgeon Bay said they were in a
small truck on their way to work for a tree-trimming service at the
time of the crash.
   Suppanz said his truck was jolted at least six or seven times
during the chain-reaction crash, but his only injury was a bump on
the head.
   Lauder said five or six vehicles crashed in front of his truck,
and a fuel tanker truck was behind it. Two other vehicles started
on fire, and the tanker driver was worried the blaze could spread
to his gasoline cargo, Lauder said.
   ``The tanker truck driver was yelling, `Get out of here. Get out
of here. The tank might blow,''' Suppanz said.
   ``There were cars that were smashed and burned beyond
recognition. It is a miracle more people weren't killed,'' said
Suppanz. ``We were lucky.''
   Lauder estimated he was traveling about 30 mph when his truck
first collided with another vehicle.
   In southern Wisconsin, fog was blamed for the collision of four
tractor-trailer rigs in eastbound lanes of Interstate 94 near Lake
Mills after the lead truck slowed because of low visibility. The
Wisconsin State Patrol said the accident closed the eastbound lanes
for more than two hours. One driver suffered a broken leg.
   Williams, the coroner, said the three who were killed were in
separate cars and were in the middle of the pileup. Two were burned
beyond recognition, she said.
   Of the injured, two were admitted to St. Mary's Hospital Medical
Center and were in serious condition, spokeswoman Susan Fisk said.
   St. Vincent Hospital admitted five crash victims, spokesman Jim
Reck said. Three were in serious condition and two in fair
condition, he said.

<TEXT>
   Economic reforms will leave 100,000
autoworkers without jobs, an auto industry official said Monday in
the most concrete sign that East Germany's radical changes could
mean widespread unemployment.
   Changes in the crippled economy could shock many East Germans
accustomed to four decades of near full employment under the
now-disgraced Communist Party.
   In East Berlin, the head of East Germany's Communist Party,
Gregor Gysi, complained of intolerance toward party members, while
the Social Democrats claimed privatization of state businesses
should be slowed down.
   At the weeklong Leipzig International Trade Fair that opened
Sunday, Dieter Voigt, the general manager of East Germany's
automobile works IFA, said layoffs of between 60 percent to 70
percent were expected in the automobile industry and related
production facilities.
   Voigt said automobile plants in East Germany employ 65,000
people, with another 150,000 people working in related electronics
and other supply industries.
   ``Of those, the jobs of between 90,000 to 105,000 are in
danger,'' Voigt said, if plants are modernized and production
restructured.
   But he said job cuts would eventually be overcome and
collaboration with West German companies would show that ``people
can go to work with new motivation and hope.''
   West German auto producers Volkswagen, Opel and Daimler-Benz
have signed joint-venture agreements with East Germany.
   Volkswagen's total investment in East German automobile
production is scheduled to reach $2.94 billion by 1994, Volkswagen
chief Carl Hahn said.
   At Monday's session of talks between the Communist Party and
opposition groups, Gysi said there had been evidence of intolerance
toward party members.
   ``Already, qualified students who belong to the party are not
admitted to universities,'' Gysi said. ``Let's not replace our old
intolerances with new ones.''
   During 40 years of hard-line rule, Communist Party members were
often given preference in the pursuit of higher education and job
opportunities.
   Gysi made his comments at the 16th and last session of weekly
talks between the political groups.

   De La Rosa, 50, would succeed James B. Hyland in the post, which
requires Senate confirmation.

   Donning boxing gloves and bemused
expressions, North Dakota's lieutenant governor and a state
commissioner skewered Norwegians, neighboring Montana and each
other in an after-dinner feast of verbal fisticuffs.
   It was billed as a bout of political light-wits, and the
audience of state officials was soon groaning. A judge couldn't
decide whose barbs were best, so he cracked a joke and disqualified
himself.
   They entered the mock ring in red boxing gloves. In early
exchanges, Lt. Gov. Lloyd Omdahl scored with a shock one-liner _
``I'm a runner, I'm not a fighter'' _ that had Public Service
Commissioner Leo Reinbold reeling.
   Omdahl pressed home his advantage, aiming for Reinbold's midriff.
   ``He comes from Hebron, you know, a city where there's no
crime,'' he said. ``Not because the people are honest but there's
nothing to steal.
   ``He was raised on a farm. His folks had hoped for corn,'' said
Omdahl, now on a roll.
   Reinbold leapt back, conjuring up the childhood of a champion.
   ``Let's fast-forward from there to March 24, 1933, western
Morton County, where Leo M. Reinbold was born, in a small log
cabin, on a hillside, with a picture of Abraham Lincoln on the wall
...,'' Reinbold said.
   ``I'll never forget, I was about 10 years old, and I was looking
around at my brothers and sisters, and they were short and I was
tall. I had red hair and they had dark hair. I had freckles and
they didn't. I started wondering about myself.
   ``I went into the house, and I talked to my mother, and I said,
`Mom, was I adopted?' And she said, `Well, yes, but they brought
you back.'''
   Reinbold's chest swelled as the crowd roared. At a banquet on
the eve of a biennial summit conference of state officials opening
Monday at the University of North Dakota, there wasn't a dry eye in
the house.
   Secretary of State Jim Kusler, North Dakota's boxing
commissioner, had introduced the combatants in a ring complete with
three hemp ropes, bright red cushions and a water bucket in each
corner.
   Montana inevitably came in for rough treatment.
   ``Do you know who discovered Montana? It was the Roto-Rooter man
working out of Williston,'' Reinbold said, scoring heavily.
   ``Only 10 percent of Montana is habitable,'' came back Omdahl.
``The people live in the rest.''
   Norwegians, a common immigrant group in North Dakota, weren't
spared. ``Do you know what 1066, 1776 and 1918 have in common? They
were adjoining rooms at the Oslo Hilton,'' Reinbold said.
   Omdahl, who is chairman of a specially appointed commission
looking into ways to cut costs in state government, ridiculed his
own work by offering some ``suggestions'' to shave expenses.
   ``The secretary of state has extra 1947 code books. Please use
these before new ones will be printed. I want that one for the
judges. I think they're using them anyway.'' he said.
   The state Supreme Court justices were split. Herbert Meschke, a
former Democratic senator, voted for Reinbold, a Republican. H.F.
``Sparky'' Gierke, a former vice chairman of the state GOP, thought
Omdahl, a Democrat, had edged it.
   Gerald VandeWalle had the final word.
   ``Lloyd, you said something about the judges still using 1947
law books,'' the justice said. ``That's because it's our considered
opinion there hasn't been anything intelligent passed since then.
   ``I have to disqualify myself,'' VandeWalle concluded. ``They're
both impossible.''

   Six Irishmen convicted of the worst terrorist
bombing in modern British history deserve a new trial because
police beat confessions out of them and new evidence has been
ignored, witnesses told a congressional panel Monday.
   ``On rare occasions we raise questions of human rights concerns
in democratic societies,'' said Rep. Thomas Lantos, D-Calif.,
chairman of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus, a bipartisan
group of 200 members of Congress.
   ``Democratic societies occasionally go wrong,'' he said.
   The Irishmen, known as the ``Birmingham Six,'' were convicted of
planting bombs in two pubs in Birmingham, England. The bombs went
off without warning, minutes apart on Nov. 21, 1974, killing 21
people and injuring 162.
   The attack was the most deadly in a series of bombings, many
linked to the Irish Republican Army, in England that year.
   ``In this case, justice has yet to be done,'' said Rep. Joseph
P. Kennedy II, D-Mass., who called the hearing.
   Witnesses said Monday that the six Irishmen arrested the night
of the bombings confessed under severe police beatings and
intimidation.
   ``We are confronted here today with a human rights abuse,'' said
Anthony Gifford, a member of the British House of Lords and an
attorney for two of the defendants.
   Seamus Mallon, a member of the British House of Commons
representing Ireland, told the caucus that the IRA, not the
Birmingham Six, was responsible for the bombings.
   ``I believe it is in the interest of peace and the interest of
stability to see that justice is done,'' Mallon said.
   The six _ Hugh Callaghan, Patrick Hill, Gerry Hunter, Richard
McIlkenny, Billy Power and Johnny Walker _ are serving life
sentences for murder.
   A 1988 court of appeals decision upheld the life sentences. But
since then, the West Midlands Serious Crimes Squad was disbanded
after several of its officers were charged with corruption and
fabricating evidence in later cases, according to a congressional
summary. Among those under investigation are five officers who were
also involved in the Birmingham Six case.
   British Home Secretary David Waddington is considering new
evidence in the case. The home secretary is responsible for the
administration of prisons and law and order, among other things.
   Meanwhile, human rights groups including Amnesty International
have called for another look at the case and more than 130 Members
of Parliament advocated a re-opening of the investigation after one
member said he had interviewed people claiming responsibility for
the bombings.
   Francis Cornish, a spokesman for the British Embassy in
Washington, questioned whether the hearing could accomplish
anything because the government is already considering the case.
   ``We're in the middle of due process on this,'' Cornish said.
``We don't see what can come out of this hearing apart from
pressure for us to continue the process.''

   President Bush and former Japanese prime
minister Noboru Takeshita agreed Monday that ``extraordinary
efforts on both sides of the Pacific'' are needed to ease trade
tensions, the White House said.
   Bush and Takeshita, who is in the United States on a private
visit, met for about an hour to discuss trade and other thorny
issues.
   Takeshita told Bush that Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu ``has
become increasingly aware of the urgency of the problems facing the
two nations,'' according to a statement by White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater.
   Kaifu and Bush met earlier this month in Palm Springs, Calif.
   Although Takeshita no longer is in power, he still is viewed as
influential in helping to shape policy in Japan as leader of the
Liberal Democatic Party. Takeshita resigned as prime minister after
criticism of his role in the Recruit stock and influence-peddling
scandal.
   ``The two leaders discussed the public pressures'' in both
countries and ``the necessity for leaders in both countries to
re-invigorate the relationship,'' Fitzwater's statement said.
   Takeshita told Bush that Kaifu had named a team to coordinate
Japan's side of talks with the United States on easing trade
barriers, the statement said.
   ``Much of the (Bush-Takeshita) discussion concerned economic
issues currently existing between the two countries and the fact
that their solution will require extraordinary efforts on both
sides of the Pacific,'' the statement said.
   Takeshita declined to speak with reporters as he left the White
House. He was also meeting with Secretary of State James A. Baker
III, with whom he played golf Sunday.
   In a picture-taking session earlier, Bush and Takeshitatalked
briefly about changes on the world political scene.
   ``Such fascinating changes in Europe and now in this hemisphere,
wonderful,'' Bush told his guest as reporters were ushered into the
Oval Office.
   ``In the case of Brazil, the new president is just 40 years
old,'' Takeshita said, speaking in Japanese. ``I will be meeting a
very young person.''
   Takeshita will attend Thursday's inauguration of Fernando Collor
de Mello in Brazil.
   Fitzwater said before the meeting that Bush would ``emphasize
again that the United States needs and wants access to Japanese
markets, that we have strong protectionist pressures in the
Congress, and any help that the former prime minister can give us
in relaying that message to the people and the government of Japan
would be helpful.''
   Bush has sent Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher to Tokyo
for further talks on the trade disputes.

<HEAD>Witness Says Third Mate Was at Fault For Exxon Valdez Grounding</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An expert witness testified Monday that
the Exxon Valdez disaster would not have happened if skipper Joseph
Hazelwood had been on the bridge, but insisted Hazelwood didn't
cause the nation's worst oil spill.
   Former tanker captain Shiras Walker, testifying for the defense
in Hazelwood's trial, said he believes the third mate, Gregory
Cousins, was responsible for the March 24 grounding of the Exxon
Valdez.
   Walker also said he believes Hazelwood's remarks immediately
after the grounding were meaningless because ``he was coming apart
mentally ... He was telling them what they wanted to hear.''
   For that reason, Walker said, he discounted Hazelwood's remarks
that he was trying to move the grounded tanker off jagged Bligh
Reef. He said he believed the skipper actually was stabilizing the
vessel so it would not float off the reef with the coming high tide.
   Walker said his opinions were based on experience commanding
similar tankers, declaring, ``I walked several thousand miles in
Capt. Hazelwood's shoes.''
   Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y., was the only crew member of
the Exxon Valdez charged criminally in the wreck, which spilled
nearly 11 million gallons of oil.
   He is accused of criminal mischief, reckless endangerment,
operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent discharge of
oil. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of 7\ years in prison
and $61,000 in fines.
   ``Isn't it true that if Capt. Hazelwood was on the bridge where
he was supposed to be, this wouldn't have happened?'' Assistant
District Attorney Mary Anne Henry asked during cross-examination.
   After the judge overruled a defense objection that the question
called for speculation, Walker answered: ``I might disagree with
that `supposed to be' part. But if Capt. Hazelwood was on the
bridge during those maneuvers, this accident wouldn't have
happened.''
   Under redirect questioning from the defense, Walker was asked
whether he believed Hazelwood's absence from the bridge contributed
to the grounding of the vessel in any way.
   ``None at all,'' Walker answered.
   The former captain told jurors that the only regulation he knows
of requiring a captain to be on the bridge is during a transit of
the Panama Canal.
   Earlier, Walker testified that the third mate had failed to
properly carry out orders left behind by Hazelwood. Walker said it
was the third mate's responsibility to see to it that Hazelwood's
orders were carried out by the helmsman, who failed to execute the
10-degree right turn called for.
   Walker was the first witness in the lengthy trial to directly
point a finger at Third Mate Gregory Cousins, who was placed in
control of the ship while Hazelwood went below to do paperwork.
Most other witnesses have blamed the helmsman, Robert Kagan.
   Walker, testifying on cross-examination, acknowledged that he
considers a helmsman ``just another piece of the machinery,'' and
indicated the third mate should have kept close watch to make sure
he obeyed orders.
   He said the only thing the helmsman needed to know to carry out
his job was knowing the difference between right and left and the
ability to read the numbers 1 through 35.
   Asked whether any able-bodied seaman should be able to carry out
an order for a 10-degree right turn, the witness replied,
``Probably anybody above the age of 5 could have carried that out.''
   ``So what you are saying is that if Greg Cousins had followed
Capt. Hazelwood's instructions and watched the rudder angle
indicator to make sure the rudder angle order was being obeyed, the
Exxon Valdez would not have hit Bligh Reef?'' the prosecutor asked.
   ``Yes, ma'am,'' said Walker.
   ``And what you're saying is that because Greg Cousins did not
follow Capt. Hazelwood's order, the grounding is Cousins' fault,''
Henry added.
   ``Yes, ma'am,'' responded Walker.
   ``And Capt. Hazelwood is not at fault at all?'' Henry asked.
   ``No, ma'am,'' said the witness.

<HEAD>FAA Inspectors Not Trained to Stop Drinking Pilots, Congressman

   The Federal Aviation Administration said
Monday it would upgrade the training of its inspectors to prevent
crews from flying airliners under heavy alcohol influence.
   An inexperienced FAA inspector in Fargo, N.D., allowed a
Northwest Airlines jet to take off last Thursday despite a tip that
the crew had been drinking for more than six hours.
   FAA Administrator James Busey told the chairman of the House
aviation subcommittee Monday ``he was going to get their
(inspectors) training upgraded to deal with situations like that,''
said FAA spokesperson JoAnn Sloane.
   ``The system could fail again the same way,'' Rep. Jim Oberstar,
D-Minn., said at a news conference after meeting with Busey. ``The
FAA is going to act on this quickly or we're going to burn their
behind.''
   Sloane said she could not provide any details of how the
inspector training would be improved.
   The three crew members on the flight from Fargo to Minneapolis
were arrested upon landing last Thursday when blood tests showed
excessive alcohol levels. The FAA revoked their licenses.
   The Fargo inspector didn't detain the crew members because they
didn't smell of alcohol and didn't appear to be impaired, said
Oberstar. The inspector interviewed the men and observed them for
more than an hour while they prepared for departure, Oberstar said.
   The FAA had said that the Fargo inspector did not have the
authority to stop the plane from taking off under North Dakota law
and that the tip didn't consitute evidence of intoxication.
   However, Oberstar said Northwest or any other airline would have
voluntarily grounded the flight had it been warned of the
allegations.
   ``You don't want to throw the book at this FAA inspector at this
point ... but there clearly ought to have been training at some
point to deal with these circumstances,'' he said.
   The FAA said Sunday that it received an anonymous tip at least
three hours before the Boeing 727 with 91 passengers left Fargo.
The person making the call said the cockpit crew had been drinking.
   Northwest Airlines received a similar tip but could not match
the names it was given with its crew list, Oberstar said.
   Flight 650 took off from Hector International Airport in Fargo
at 6:25 a.m. local time after an unexplained 25-minute delay that
Northwest said is part of the company's investigation.
   It arrived in Minneapolis at 7:30 a.m., and the crew was placed
under citizen's arrest by an FAA inspector at the airport, detained
by the airport police and given a blood-alcohol test.
   Busey announced Friday that the test showed all three had a
blood alcohol level above .04 percent, exceeding the federal limit
for flight crews.
   The three have the right to appeal their emergency license
revocations within 10 days to the National Transportation Safety
Board.
   The Minneapolis city attorney's office said charges might be
brought this week under state law. Flying while intoxicated is a
misdemeanor, carrying up to 90 days jail and a $700 fine.
   Airport police identified the crew members as Capt. Norman
Prouse, 51, of Conyers, Ga.; first officer Robert J. Kirchner, 35,
of Highland Ranch, Colo., and second officer Joseph W. Balzer, 34,
of Antioch, Tenn.
   Attempts to reach Prouse have been unsuccessful, Kirchner has
not returned phone calls and Balzer referred questions to attorneys
for the Air Line Pilots Association.

   Unseasonably warm weather broke out Monday from the northern
Plains to the East Coast, with records broken or tied in 16 states
and the District of Columbia, and snow was scattered over parts of
the West.
   More than 50 cities broke or tied high temperature records for
the date, and some had their highest temperatures for any day in
the whole month of March.
   The high of 67 at La Crosse, Wis., broke a record that had been
on the books since 1877.
   Most of the record highs were in the 60s and 70s but downtown
Baltimore had an astonishing record high of 92, and Richmond, Va.,
and Augusta, Ga., reached 88.
   Record highs were set or tied in Delaware, Illinois,
Indianapolis, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota,
Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania,
Virginia, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia.
   ``I can't believe the weather,'' said Mary Ann Karpovich, a
Dushore, Pa., grocery clerk who licked a chocolate ice cream cone
while sitting on a bench at the crowded Boardwalk at Atlantic City,
N.J., which had a record 82.
   Elsewhere in New Jersey, golfers took advantage of Monday's
weather by flocking to the Princeton Country Club, said park
manager Pete Palmieri. The club's usual 80-90 golfers on a March
day more than doubled Monday to 195, Palmieri said.
   Locally heavy snow fell during the morning in north-central
Wyoming, including 2 inches of snow in one hour at Buffalo.
   Snowfall diminished Monday after falling across northern Arizona
since Sunday morning, accumulating to 7 inches at Flagstaff, 4
inches at Walnut Canyon and 3 inches at the southern rim of the
Grand Canyon.
   At midday, snow fell across northern Montana into west-central
Montana, northern Wyoming, east-central Nevada and central Arizona.
   Rain extended across northern North Dakota, northern Minnesota,
northwestern Wisconsin, eastern Upper Michigan, north-central New
York state, and from east-central New York state across southern
New England.
   Showers and thunderstorms reached from western Kentucky across
western Tennessee and northern Mississippi, and from southwestern
Louisiana across the northern and central Texas Gulf Coast into
central Texas.
   Wind gusted to 41 mph during the morning at Moline, Ill., 48 mph
at Chicago's O'Hare airport and 46 mph at Clayton, N.M.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 24
degrees at Cut Bank, Mont., to 92 at Cherry Point, N.C.
   Monday's low for the Lower 48 states was zero at McCall, Idaho.

<HEAD>Retired Colonel Pleads Guilty To Distributing Classified Documents</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A retired Air Force lieutenant colonel
pleaded guilty Monday to a felony conspiracy charge that, as a
Grumman Corp. employee, he unlawfully obtained and distributed
classified Pentagon budget documents.
   As part of the plea bargain, Harry Kotellos agreed to cooperate
fully with the government investigation into the illegal
trafficking in classified Defense Department documents.
   Kotellos, 53, is a West Point graduate and retired Air Force
lieutenant colonel who has worked for Grumman since 1980, said his
attorney, Plato Cacheris.
   He faces a maximum penalty of $250,000 in fines and five years
imprisonment when he is sentenced May 18 for his actions from 1980
through 1985.
   The documents involved were those that summarize the resources
the Pentagon is planning to spend in future years, said Richard
Smith, assistant special agent in charge of the Defense Criminal
Investigative Service's Washington field office. The case also
involved Air Force budget documents, according to court papers.
   ``Mr. Kotellos was a significant player in the tightly knit
group which acquired and distributed some very sensitive DoD
information,'' said Michael J. Costello, special agent in charge of
the DCIS Washington field office. ``We have attempted to reach the
inner core of the network and neutralize it.''
   Investigators would not say whether Grumman itself was under
investigation.
   But Grumman spokesman Larry Hamilton said: ``Grumman is engaged
in discussions with the government as to the consequences to the
company of Mr. Kotellos' plea. Since this matter continues to be
under review, the company cannot comment on these discussions.''
   The DCIS field office has been conducting an investigation _
code-named Operation Uncover_ since the mid-1980s into illegal
transfers of Pentagon documents to defense contractors.
   Last Friday, Hughes Aircraft Co. became the fourth major defense
contractor to plead guilty to unlawfully obtaining Defense
Department budget documents, and agreed to pay a total of $3.67
million in fines and restitution.
   Previous companies to plead guilty are:
   _GTE Government Systems Division, which paid about $300,000 in
fines in 1985.
   _The Boeing Company, which paid fines and restitution of $5.2
million last November. Boeing employee Richard Lee Fowler was
convicted last December of all counts of a 39-count indictment.
   _RCA Corp., which was ordered Feb. 5 to pay fines and
restitution of $2.75 million. Former RCA employee Leonard Kampf and
current RCA employee Ronald Stevens each pleaded guilty to one
felony count and face sentencing April 6.
   The plea agreement submitted Monday to U.S. District Judge
Claude Hilton is contingent on Kotellos' cooperation in the probe.
   The conspiracy count says Kotellos acquired classified documents
from a government employee who was not authorized to release them,
getting classified documents from Fowler of Boeing, sharing
classified documents with other defense contractors and obtaining
such documents from them, and destroying some of the documents in
his fireplace at home.
   The government employee was not identified in court papers, and
Smith declined to reveal the name or to say whether that person was
under investigation.
   The source close to the investigation said he believed
prosecutors ``may have a problem with the statute of limitations''
in the case against the government employee because of a lack of
information of wrongdoing after 1984.
   The court papers say Kotellos got documents from the government
employee ``on approximately two occasions between 1980 and December
1984.''
   Said Smith: ``In a continuing conspiracy, the last overt act
that an individual or corporation does in furtherance of that
conspiracy can continue the life of the statute of limitations.''
   The 1985 actions enabled prosecutors to go after Kotellos, Smith
said.
   Kotellos was placed on administrative leave with pay from his
job as a senior marketing analyst at the Washington operations
office on Monday morning, said Grumman spokesman Larry Hamilton.

   Police broke up a demonstration Monday in downtown
Moscow to commemorate the Russian revolution that ended czarist
rule, the Tass news agency said. Thirty-one people were reported
arrested.
   The news agency said the Democratic Union, an unofficial
political party, gathered several hundred people in Moscow's
Mayakovsky Square to mark the 1917 spring revolution that Communist
founder Vladimir I. Lenin in turn toppled later that year.
   Moscow authorities had refused to permit the demonstration in
the center of the city and offered to let demonstrators rally near
a stadium on the south side of the capital, Tass said.
   ``Slogans against the Communist Party and the Soviet state and
social system were chanted by some people,'' the official news
agency said.
   It said police restored order and arrested 31 people after the
crowd ignored repeated calls to disperse.
   There was no information on injuries.

   Shimon Peres won Labor Party approval Monday to
bring down the government, after accusing Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir of leading Israel into ``the desert of indecision'' about
peace talks with Palestinians.
   The decision by Labor, which is in a ``national unity''
coalition with Shamir's conservative Likud bloc, set the stage for
a showdown. Peres leads the Labor Party and is vice premier.
   Reports said Shamir might dismiss Labor ministers from the
Cabinet.
   If the government falls, elections would be likely. The last two
elections were indecisive and tenuous Likud-Labor coalitions
resulted.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater was asked
whether the United States was concerned about Israel's failure to
accept the peace proposals of Secretary of State James A. Baker
III. He replied:
   ``Well, the process is still continuing. We're still talking and
we're still hopeful. ... The process of peace talks is a long and
arduous one.''
   Peres told the 1,300 members of the center-left Labor's Central
Committee the prime minister was stalling by not responding to the
Baker proposals.
   ``The thing is not moving, very simply,'' he said in a
nationally broadcast speech to the Labor leadership.
   ``We have reached the conclusion that Shamir will try to run a
policy of saying neither yes nor no. He will try to avoid the
decision and will pull us into the desert of indecision.''
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, speaking after Peres, said:
``The problem, the delay, the obstacle in the peace process is
Likud's refusal to vote on a positive answer. Our duty is to
guarantee a perpetual progress, and we shall do it in any way
possible.''
   At the end of an 80-minute meeting, held at Beit Berl near Tel
Aviv, the Labor leadership approved a vaguely worded, two-point
resolution with only one member dissenting.
   It said Likud prevented a Cabinet vote ``on essential issues
relating to the peace process'' and threatened continuation of
diplomatic efforts.
   The resolution authorized the Labor leadership and the party's
39 members in the 120-seat parliament to ``determine the
parliamentary moves necessitated by the situation.''
   That gave Peres a mandate to try to bring down the government by
putting his Labor Party in league with smaller leftist and
religious parties that seek a confidence vote in Parliament.
   Chaim Ramon, head of Labor's parliament faction, offered Shamir
a last-minute escape, saying:
   ``We shall treat the no-confidence motions in accordance with
the prime minister's behavior in the issue of peace. I hope that
until then the prime minister would use the opportunity provided by
us and would say yes to the peace process.''
   In his speech, Peres suggested he could work out a deal with the
religious parties, a key element in any narrow government.
   Israel TV said Labor launched intensive contacts with two
ultra-Orthodox parties immediately after the central committee
vote. The negotiations with Agudat Israel and Torah flag parties
are expected to last until early Tuesday, the television said.
   A confidence vote is expected Thursday unless a compromise is
worked out to save the 15-month-old government.
   Zevulun Hammer of the National Religious Party, religious
affairs minister, said earlier Monday he was trying to find common
ground. After the Labor vote, he said: ``I believe that my effort
still has a chance.''
   Shortly before the Labor decision, however, Shamir aide Avi
Pazner said little room was left for compromise.
   ``It looks like the two parties are going for a showdown
Thursday,'' he said. ``It would take a miracle to reach a
compromise before that.''
   Cabinet member Ronnie Milo of Likud said the decision clearly
meant Labor had decided to end the coalition.
   Labor ``is not thinking of the peace process,'' he said. ``They
want to break the government to advance their party's and personal
interests.''
   ``If you decide you cannot be partners in such a government,
stand up and resign. Don't try to stay in the government while
attempting to bring it down.''
   Shamir was said to be considering dismissal of all 10 Labor
ministers so they could not be part of a transitional government
that would take over if a no-confidence motion passed.
   The government crisis began last month when Labor demanded the
Cabinet approve the Baker proposals, which had been under
consideration since October.
   On Sunday, Shamir refused to allow the decision-making Inner
Cabinet to vote on the plan, which involves arranging preliminary
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks in Cairo. The Inner Cabinet is made
up of six Labor and six Likud ministers.
   Labor ministers walked out of the meeting on grounds the failure
to vote meant a negative response.
   Labor supports the Baker proposals, but Likud says the provision
for including residents of Arab east Jerusalem in the talks could
threaten Israel's declared sovereignty over the area.
   Likud also opposes participation by exiled Palestinians on
grounds that could provide an opening to the talks for the
Palestine Liberation Organization, which Israel views as a
terrorist organization.
   Hammer has suggested Israel give Baker a positive answer, with
the question of participation by east Jerusalem Arabs to be decided
by Parliament.
   The Israel-Palestinian talks are meant to lead to eventual
elections in the Israeli-occupied territories, with their final
status decided later.

<HEAD>Soviets Protest Handling of KGB Defector</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union lodged a ``strong protest''
with the United States on Monday over the handling of Victor I.
Sheymov, a KGB defector who surfaced after nearly a decade in the
United States.
   Sergey B. Chetverikov, minister-counselor at the Soviet Embassy,
accused U.S. intelligence agencies of ``subversive action'' for
smuggling Sheymov, his wife and 5-year-old daughter out of the
Soviet Union in 1980.
   The family's exit from the Soviet Union was a ``gross violation
of rules of international law, which is, in fact, an act of state
terrorism,'' Chetverikov told reporters at a news conference.
   Chetverikov said he met with Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence
Eagleburger on Monday to complain about the Sheymov affair.
Chetverikov said he was particularly concerned about allegations
Sheymov made as a time of a thaw in relations between the two
superpowers.
   ``The Soviet Embassy lodged a strong protest with the State
Department,'' he said.
   The State Department had no immediate comment.
   Chetverikov confirmed that Sheymov was employed by the KGB, but
the embassy official said he worked as a ``coding equipment
maintenance technician.'' As such, Sheymov had ``no access to
serious secret information, including documents,'' the embassy
official said.
   Sheymov, 43, appeared at a press conference March 2, making a
series of allegations.
   Among other things, he said that in the late 1970s the Soviet
Union had two sources inside the State Department who were able to
deliver secret information on U.S. policy and negotiating
positions. The department refused any comment on that case at the
time.
   Sheymov also said he was present in the Warsaw station of the
KGB in 1979 when a cable arrived from Moscow ordering what he
believed to be the initial stages of a plot to assassinate Pope
John Paul II.
   The Soviet Embassy denied Sheymov's claim about the pope.
``Totally untenable and malicious from beginning to end is his
assertion about the committee for state security's involvement in
the affair relating to the attempt on Pope John Paul II's life,''
Chetverikov said.
   He said the CIA leadership knew ``very well that the KGB had not
and could not have anything to do with this heinous crime.''
Allegations have long circulated about possible Soviet involvement
in a plot to kill the pope after the pope was wounded by a gunman's
bullet in 1981. No connection with Moscow has ever been firmly
established, however.
   Chetverikov also said ``hints about the KGB's involvement in
organizing the attempt on the late President Zia ul Haq of Pakistan
can also be described as wild fiction.'' Zia was killed when a
plane blew up in Pakistan in 1988.
   Chetverikov claimed that the CIA had put statements in Sheymov's
mouth as a ``hostile action.'' Forces inside the United States, the
Soviet official said, were bent on disrupting growing ties between
Moscow and Washington. Sheymov has said he is looking for a
publisher for his book.
   Despite the protest, Chetverikov said he doubted Moscow would
retaliate in any way against the United States. ``I guess we are
beyond that stage,'' he said.
   At the same time, he said Sheymov's actions had a ``very
negative effect'' on perceptions in the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>World Hails Lithuania Declaration of Independence _ with Caution</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Governments from Australia to Italy on Monday cheered
Lithuania's declaration of independence from Soviet rule, but
congratulations came mixed with caution.
   The Bush administration expressed support for Lithuania's move,
while saying the United States will delay formal recognition of the
breakaway republic until the Lithuanians are ``in control of their
own destiny.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater reiterated the
administration's call for the Soviet central government to
``respect the will of the citizens'' in the Baltic state.
   The newly elected non-Communist legislature of Lithuania on
Sunday voted to declare its independence 50 years after the Soviet
Union annexed the sovereign state of Lithuania on the basis of an
agreement with Nazi Germany.
   The United States and other Western nations never recognized the
Soviet Union's forcible annexation of Lithuania in 1940 and its
Baltic neighbors Latvia and Estonia while under Red Army
occupation. The three states, once part of czarist Russia, had
gained independence after World War I.
   Foreign Office Minister William Waldegrave said in London on
Monday that Britain is ``fascinated'' by Lithuania's action, but
has no immediate plans to recognize Lithuania as a country separate
from the Soviet Union.
   ``The legal right of the Lithuanian people to seek
self-determination is not in question. But when it comes to the
recognition of states ... we haven't quite got to that point yet.
We may well do so,'' Waldegrave said in a British Broadcasting
Corp. radio interview.
   Waldegrave said ``a considerable negotiation'' with the Soviet
Union would have to take place before Lithuanians ``know the full
extent of the implications of what they are seeking.''
   Fitzwater, too, remarked at a news briefing that Washington was
not recognizing the new government at once ``because we would want
any recognition to take into account a final government that was in
control of their own destiny, and much of that has yet to be
negotiated with the Soviet Union.''
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev called Lithuania's move
``alarming'' when he opened a congress of Communist Party deputies
Monday in Moscow, but gave no indication he plans any action to
prevent Lithuania from seceding.
   The Solidarity-led government in Poland expressed hope Monday
that neighboring Lithuania would be able to achieve statehood in a
peaceful way.
   ``The Polish government supports nations' self-determination,
including self-determination leading to separate statehood,''
government spokeswoman Malgorzata Niezabitowska said in a statement
on the nightly news.
   Earlier Monday, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa expressed his joy
at the decision in a message sent to Vytautas Lansbergis,
Lithuania's new president, adding that he hoped the process of
separation would be peaceful.
   Historical links between Lithuania and Poland date to 1386, when
the Lithuanian ruler Jagiello married a Polish princess. The
Jagiellonian dynasty ruled until 1569, when the two nations joined
in a commonwealth that lasted until Russia took over in 1795.
   Members of the Lithuanian community in the Polish town of Punsk,
which lies near the border, put up Lithuanian and Polish flags
after watching the independence declaration on television, the
state news agency PAP reported.
   In his message, Walesa raised the issue of the fate of 260,000
Poles living in Lithuania who now are seeking greater access to
their cultural heritage long denied under the republic's previous
Communist leaders.
   Italy expressed hope that Soviet and Lithuanian authorities
would be able to peacefully iron out their differences over the
republic.
   ``The Italian government, which has never recognized the
annexation of Lithuania by the Soviet Union, salutes the
declaration of independence,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Giovanni
Castellaneta said in a statement.
   Australia welcomed the Lithuanian declaration and urged Moscow
to accept it without confrontation.
   Foreign Minister Gareth Evans said in a statement, ``The
Australian government acknowledges the resolution of the freely
elected Parliament of Lithuania declaring it to be an independent
state.
   ``We welcome any development that lends reality to the
Lithuanian independence which we already legally recognize.''

   Twenty Vietnamese refugees in a detention

outbreak of violence in the crowded camps, authorities said.
   Police said they quickly restored order. No further details were
available. Such fights have often broken out among Vietnamese boat
people in Hong Kong's detention camps the past few months. Homemade
weapons, including knives and iron bars, have been used.
   About 55,000 Vietnamese boat people now live in this British

   Hong Kong considers most as illegal immigrants subject to
deportation back to Vietnam, but Hanoi so far has accepted
mandatory repatriation of only about 50 Vietnamese. Refugees
fleeing political persecution are allowed to resettle elsewhere.

<TEXT>
   Arab nomads and tribal farmers clashed in
western Sudan in the latest outbreak of an ancient feud, killing 69
people and burning down 14 villages, the official news agency
reported Monday.
   The fighting between the Arabs and the Fur, a Moslem non-Arab
farming tribe, took place last week at the Shattaya villages of
Wadi Salih in the Darfour region, the Sudan News Agency said,
without giving a specific cause for the latest unrest.
   It said the governor of Darfour, Maj. Gen. Abul-Gasim Ibrahim,
toured the area to try to reconcile the two sides. Reporting from
el-Fasher, the capital of Darfour, the agency said the governor has
ordered weapons collected from the fighters.
   It said he also appealed to both sides to abide by a July
reconciliation agreement. The accord stipulated that each tribe pay
the other compensation for losses in previous clashes.
   Western relief workers say the age-old clashes escalated last
year. They say 2,000 to 3,000 people were killed in the Darfour
clashes.
   Every winter for hundreds of years, cattle-herding Baggara and
other smaller nomadic tribes have interloped on Fur farms as they
trekked toward water and grazing lands to the south.
   They fought brief battles, with limited deaths. Differences were
resolved in traditional peace councils after the fighting. Blood
money was paid for victims and compensation for destroyed farms.

opposition and other political groups signed political agreements
Monday that ensure equal terms for all parties competing in June
elections.
   The agreements also require that until the elections, all draft
legislation must be first agreed at the current all-party talks
before going to the Communist-dominated parliament for adoption,
the state media reported.
   Bulgaria radio said a third agreement guarantees peaceful
transition to a democratic system.
   The accords were adopted at negotiations that resumed Monday
after having been suspended a month over disagreements on reform.
   The negotiators also agreed that international observers from
the United States, the Soviet Union and other European countries
should be invited to attend the June elections, the state BTA news
agency reported.
   Zhelyu Zhelev, chairman of the Union of Democratic Forces, a
loose coalition of 19 opposition groups, called Monday's signings a
historic act, BTA said.
   The agreements outlined the basic aspects seen as crucial to a
democratic political system, including a freely elected parliament,
a multiparty system, equality of different forms of ownership and
basic human rights, BTA said.
   Major draft legislation toward holding free elections is to be
discussed at the negotiations and brought to Parliament at its next
session. The negotiation parties will meet again Thursday.
   Zhelev reportedly credited the opposition's recent mass rallies
for getting the agreements wrapped up.
   Communist Party chief Alexander Lilov, who for the first time
headed the Communist delegation to the talks on Monday, stressed
the importance of the accords for Bulgaria's political future and
called for mutual respect and responsibility of all parties
concerned, the radio reported.
   In a conciliatory gesture, Petko Simeonov, a senior official of
the Union of Democratic Forces and director of the new UDF
newspaper Demokratsiya, spoke of ``a victory of democratic forces,
irrespective of the side of the table on which they are sitting,''
the radio reported.
   The Union of Democratic Forces suspended the talks Feb. 12. They
complained that the Communists refused to agree to abolishing
Communist Party organizations at the work place and to other points
now agreed. The Communists have promised to withdraw from the work
place.
   The agreements came after a weekend conference of opposition
parties in Plovdiv, where four small, non-aligned democratic
parties joined the UDF, the strongest opposition grouping.
   Parties of a small non-Communist coalition called the Political
Opposition Bloc still refuse to join the UDF, as does the
Alternative Socialist Party, a reformist group that split from the
Communist Party last month.

   Said Mohamed Djohar captured the
presidency of this Indian Ocean republic in an election to replace
his slain predecessor, final results showed Monday.
   However, his opponent in Sunday's runoff charged fraud and
immediately challenged the outcome.
   The elections became necessary when President Ahmed Abdallah
Abderrahmane was assassinated Nov. 26. French mercenary Bob Denard
took control of the island, but he yielded to popular protests and
arriving French troops by giving up power the following month.
   Denard, widely blamed for killing the president, has denied the
accusation.
   Djohar said Saturday he hopes South Africa, which has granted
Denard temporary refuge, will extradite him to face a trial for the
slaying. No extradition treaty exists between the countries.
   The National Election Commission said Monday that Djohar, who
was serving as interim president of the Comoro Republic, won a
seven-year term with 55 percent of the vote. His opponent, Mohamed
Taki, gained 45 percent.
   Final results gave Djohar 102,882 votes, compared with 83,250
for Taki.
   However, Taki claimed he was deprived of 30,000 votes by fraud
at 15 polling stations. The complaints must be considered by this
nation's Supreme Court.
   Taki, leader of the Comoran Union for Democracy, won the most
votes in last week's first-round elections with 24 percent of the
ballots cast. Djohar gained 23 percent.
   The remaining six opposition candidates had split their support
between Djohar and Taki for the runoff.
   Taki declared less than four hours after polls opened Sunday
that he would demand the results be scrapped. He said his
supporters were harassed and their ballots confiscated.
   Beatings, incomplete voter rolls and missing ballots forced
Djohar to annul the original first round of elections on Feb. 14.
   Voting officials said about 40 percent of the 300,000 eligible
voters abstained Sunday.
   After independence from France in 1975, Abdallah led the islands
until Denard ousted him later that year. However, Denard backed
Abdallah's return to power three years later in this archipelago
between Mozambique and Madagascar.
   The Frenchman in concert with other European mercenaries
commanded the Presidential Guard, giving him effective control of
the republic.
   The South African government said it hopes to be rid of Denard
as soon as it can find a country willing to take him.
   In addition to any prosecution in the Comoros, the mercenary
faces criminal charges in France for a failed 1977 coup in the West
African country Benin.
   The islands' main industries are fishing and tourism, which is
controlled mostly by South African interests. The average annual
income for the mostly Moslem population is less than $300.

   A congress of ethnic Estonians on
Monday demanded an ``exact deadline for ending the occupation and
illegal annexation of the republic of Estonia'' as the first step
toward restoring its independence.
   The parliament of another Soviet Baltic republic, Lithuania,
declared its independence from the Soviet Union on Sunday.
   Estonia has no need to do that because this land of 1.6 million
residents is already an independent, though occupied country, said
Tunne Kelam, a leader of the movement to create the congress.
   Trivimi Velliste, a founder of the citizens' movement, declared,
``We want Moscow now to recognize the expression of the will of the
Estonian people. Our main aim is to establish our legal position of
an occupied country.''
   Estonians are using different tactics from the Lithuanians to
restore the statehood both enjoyed between the world wars because
only 60 percent of its population is ethnic Estonian. The rest are
largely Russians who have migrated to the area since it was
forcibly annexed in 1940, and many of them prefer to remain part of
the Soviet Union.
   Lithuania is still 80 percent Lithuanian and support there for
independence is overwhelming.
   Estonian activists registered 700,000 ethnic Estonians, who last
month elected 465 representatives to the new congress which
convened over the weekend. Activists say this organization is the
true legislature, not the Supreme Soviet parliament that will be
elected Sunday by all the Soviet citizens of Estonia.
   The two-day session that ended Monday demanded that Moscow
withdraw all Soviet troops and immediately cease KGB activity in
Estonia. The group also wants Soviet military bases abolished.
   Velliste said the Soviet Union has 150,000 soldiers in Estonia,
or about one of every 10 people. He said more are coming here as
they are withdrawn from Eastern Europe.
   ``Some of them are situated only 50 kilometers (31 miles) east
of Tallinn and forced to camp out in tents for lack of space,'' he
said.
   Velliste said his group would be willing to negotiate on troop
withdrawal.
   A declaration that described all state authorities of the
Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic as ``only administrative organs
for the occupation'' was read out to tumultuous applause.
   However, the congress voted to restore good neighborly relations
with the Soviet Union ``on the basis of mutually beneficial
cooperation and respect for each other's rights.''
   Velliste said Estonians do not fear the consequences.
   He asked, ``What else can they do to us? We have experienced
everything. We have experienced mass deportations and killings in
the Stalinist regime.''
   Congress delegates elected a 78-member council to conduct talks
with Moscow and foreign nations for recognition of complete
independence.
   ``The congress has the sole legitimate power now in Estonia. The
Supreme Soviet will have no official position,'' said Kelam, who is
expected to be elected council chairman.
   However, delegates said the new 105-member Supreme Soviet
parliament to be elected next Sunday would play a role in
cooperating with the council in the transition period.
   ``After we get guarantees from Moscow about the withdrawal of
troops, we will hold parliamentary elections, and form the first
democratically elected government of an independent Estonia,''
Velliste said in an interview.
   ``We shall have that government by the end of 1991, maybe even
sooner.''
   Volunteers guarded the congress entrance after a break-in at
congress headquarters and purported attempts by members of the
largely Russian group Interfront to sabotage the meeting.
   Forty-three non-voting members at the congress represented
35,000 non-Estonians who said they want to be citizens of
independent Estonia when the new government is established.

   Governments from Australia to Italy on Monday cheered
Lithuania's declaration of independence from Soviet rule, but
congratulations came mixed with caution.
   The Bush administration expressed support for Lithuania's move,
while saying the United States will delay formal recognition of the
breakaway republic until the Lithuanians are ``in control of their
own destiny.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater reiterated the
administration's call for the Soviet central government to
``respect the will of the citizens'' in the Baltic state.
   The newly elected non-Communist legislature of Lithuania on
Sunday voted to declare its independence 50 years after the Soviet
Union annexed the sovereign state of Lithuania on the basis of an
agreement with Nazi Germany.
   The United States and other Western nations never recognized the
Soviet Union's forcible annexation of Lithuania in 1940 and its
Baltic neighbors Latvia and Estonia while under Red Army
occupation. The three states, once part of czarist Russia, had
gained independence after World War I.
   In Ottawa, External Affairs Minister Joe Clark said Canada will
encourage Moscow to negotiate Lithuania's reclaimed independence.
   However, Clark also said there are ``legitimate and prudent''
concerns that the Baltic independence movements might touch off
similar, rapid developments by other Soviet republics. He asserted
that Lithuania ``would not necessarily constitute a precedent in
other cases.''
   Foreign Office Minister William Waldegrave said in London on
Monday that Britain is ``fascinated'' by Lithuania's action, but
has no immediate plans to recognize Lithuania as a country separate
from the Soviet Union.
   ``The legal right of the Lithuanian people to seek
self-determination is not in question. But when it comes to the
recognition of states ... we haven't quite got to that point yet.
We may well do so,'' Waldegrave said in a British Broadcasting
Corp. radio interview.
   Waldegrave said ``a considerable negotiation'' with the Soviet
Union would have to take place before Lithuanians ``know the full
extent of the implications of what they are seeking.''
   Fitzwater, too, remarked at a news briefing that Washington was
not recognizing the new government at once ``because we would want
any recognition to take into account a final government that was in
control of their own destiny, and much of that has yet to be
negotiated with the Soviet Union.''
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev called Lithuania's move
``alarming'' when he opened a congress of Communist Party deputies
Monday in Moscow, but gave no indication he plans any action to
prevent Lithuania from seceding.
   The Solidarity-led government in Poland expressed hope Monday
that neighboring Lithuania would be able to achieve statehood in a
peaceful way.
   ``The Polish government supports nations' self-determination,
including self-determination leading to separate statehood,''
government spokeswoman Malgorzata Niezabitowska said in a statement
on the nightly news.
   Earlier Monday, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa expressed his joy
at the decision in a message sent to Vytautas Lansbergis,
Lithuania's new president, adding that he hoped the process of
separation would be peaceful.
   Historical links between Lithuania and Poland date to 1386, when
the Lithuanian ruler Jagiello married a Polish princess. The
Jagiellonian dynasty ruled until 1569, when the two nations joined
in a commonwealth that lasted until Russia took over in 1795.
   Members of the Lithuanian community in the Polish town of Punsk,
which lies near the border, put up Lithuanian and Polish flags
after watching the independence declaration on television, the
state news agency PAP reported.
   In his message, Walesa raised the issue of the fate of 260,000
Poles living in Lithuania who now are seeking greater access to
their cultural heritage long denied under the republic's previous
Communist leaders.
   Italy expressed hope that Soviet and Lithuanian authorities
would be able to peacefully iron out their differences over the
republic.
   ``The Italian government, which has never recognized the
annexation of Lithuania by the Soviet Union, salutes the
declaration of independence,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Giovanni
Castellaneta said in a statement.
   Australia welcomed the Lithuanian declaration and urged Moscow
to accept it without confrontation.
   Foreign Minister Gareth Evans said in a statement, ``The
Australian government acknowledges the resolution of the freely
elected Parliament of Lithuania declaring it to be an independent
state.
   ``We welcome any development that lends reality to the
Lithuanian independence which we already legally recognize.''

   The vow of celibacy taken by Roman Catholic
priests and nuns was one reason they were sought as potential
subjects for an experimental AIDS vaccine developed by Dr. Jonas
Salk, a researcher said Monday.
   The researcher, Katharine Munson, also said it was Archbishop
Roger Mahony's idea to suggest an age of 65 or older in a Jan. 25
letter to 3,500 priests and nuns telling them that volunteers were
needed.
   Mahony, however, denied Sunday that anyone suggested to him that
Catholic clergy were being sought because of their celibate lives.
   ``You're really looking for people who have a commitment to
humankind and willingness to take risks to benefit others,'' he
said.
   Munson, clinical director of the study at the University of
Southern California's Norris Cancer Institute, said the program was
in no special need of candidates and has already been contacted by
hundreds of people.
   Salk works at the La Jolla, Calif., institute that bears his
name, but the AIDS research is to be done at the Norris clinic.
   On Monday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved
expanded testing of the vaccine outside California.
   Reached at his home Monday, Salk declined to comment on the
study. ``If I start giving interviews, there will be no end to
it,'' said the 75-year-old physician, who in the 1950s created the
first polio vaccine pronounced safe and effective.
   Munson said the vaccine, Salk HIV Immunogen, is being
administered to 90 volunteers who have already tested positive for
the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   In the next phase of testing, 10 volunteers without the virus
will be given the vaccine. Munson said she didn't know whether any
of those being interviewed were Roman Catholic clergy.
   The prototype Salk vaccine is the only one among several being
developed from the whole AIDS virus. Critics say that if live
strains of the virus contaminate the vaccine, volunteers could be
accidentally infected.
   Researchers are trying to find out whether the inactivated virus
used in the vaccine will cause the body to produce specific cells,
called T cells, that destroy other cells infected with the virus.
   Munson said priests and nuns were sought as volunteers because
``in groups of people who have taken a vow of celibacy, there are
likely to be fewer people who get involved in sexual activity,''
one of the ways AIDS is transmitted.
   In this way, researchers could be certain that if the test
subjects developed the disease, it would have been caused by a
faulty vaccine, she said.
   Munson agreed the appeal was also to ``priests and nuns who live
an altruistic lifestyle, and help AIDS patients.''
   ``It wasn't our decision to ask for people who are 65,'' said
Munson. ``The archbishop put that in the letter. If it (the
vaccine) is ineffective, someone might want to be older rather than
young.
   ``The age is not our standard. Each person, young or old, will
be screened,'' she said.
   Mahony said Dr. Brian E. Henderson, director of Norris, told him
at their last meeting a few weeks ago that about six nuns had
contacted the doctor as well as one or two priests.
   The study is being conducted under a California law that permits
such experiments without FDA approval, as long as all the materials
are made in California.
   Munson said the second phase of the test, injecting people who
have tested negative for the virus, awaits state approval. Salk
said he will inject himself with the drug when testing is approved.
   Volunteer candidates had been calling regularly at the rate of
five to 15 a day, Munson said, adding that more calls were coming
following the publicity the program received over the weekend.
   While Roman Catholic officials insisted there was nothing more
to Mahony's letter than passing on information on behalf of
Henderson, some medical ethicists wondered whether church politics
was behind the move.
   ``The Roman Catholic church has come under a lot of criticism
from the AIDS community, who have called it an obstacle to
education, an obstacle to the distribution of contraceptives,''
said Arthur Caplan, a medical ethicist at the University of
Minnesota.
   ``To see the church participating in a vaccine trial carries
with it a political as well as an ethical message,'' he said.
``There are many dangerous diseases for which there are such
programs. I don't think it's an accident that this letter went out
about AIDS.''

   A concrete ceiling collapsed onto a food shop
Monday at the landmark Ansonia Hotel, killing a woman and injuring
12 others, authorities said.
   The collapse in the Croissant &amp; Co. shop on the ground floor of
the Upper West Side hotel on Broadway between 73rd and 74th streets
occurred about 3:50 p.m.
   The ceiling had been perforated with holes for pipes installed
by various tenants over the years, said Buildings Commissioner
Charles Smith said. A suspended ceiling had been added and the
combined weight apparently caused the collapse, he said.
   ``It's an old ceiling _ decorative molding, heavy plaster with
metal leaves holding it all together. It just gave way,'' Smith
said.
   ``We were drinking coffee. All of a sudden water started rushing
above and the ceiling collapsed,'' according to one young woman who
was interviewed outside.
   ``We felt the vibration. We thought the building was falling.
First it was like a vibration, then glass breaking _ and then a big
boom,'' said Elvin Rodriguez, a clerk at a nearby bookstore.
   When he went outside, Rodriguez said, a street vendor had
already run and started pulling people out.
   Fire Department spokesman John Mulligan said the collapsed area
measured 250 square feet and weighed about 2 tons. The woman who
was killed was dressed in street clothes and apparently was not an
employee, he said.
   As it collapsed, the ceiling dragged the sprinkler system down
with it, prompting initial reports that a water leak above the shop
apparently weakened the ceiling and sent it crashing onto the
patrons in the shop.
   Eleven people were taken to hospitals, and one person declined
medical aid, authorities said. Three of those taken to hospitals
suffered head injuries.
   Construction was taking place on the second floor of the
17-story building when the collapse occurred, said Efrain Parrilla,
a Fire Department spokesman.
   Fire crews later began tearing down the ceiling to make it safe
for searchers. Dogs also were being used to search debris.
   A flower shop next door, the Rose Boutique, which has a similar
ceiling, was ordered closed and evacuated as a precaution.
   The Ansonia is one of New York's architectural gems, according
to the American Institute of Architects' New York guidebook. The
heavily ornamented residential building was built in 1904 and was a
residence hotel for Enrico Caruso, Arturo Toscanini, Lily Pons,
Florenz Ziegfeld, Theodore Dreiser, Sol Hurok, Igor Stravinsky and
Babe Ruth, among other celebrities.
   Arts figures favored the hotel because it was well soundproofed,
although unintentionally. It also was featured in such movies as
``Three Days of the Condor'' and ``The Sunshine Boys.''

   Wyoming's Legislature approved a bill
honoring slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. with a
holiday after debating the issue for seven years.
   The Senate voted 21-9 to concur with House changes to the
proposal, calling the holiday Martin Luther King Jr.-Wyoming
Equality Day and celebrating it on the third Monday in January.
   If Gov. Mike Sullivan approves the legislation, Wyoming will
become the 46th state along with the federal government to observe
the holiday.
   Wyoming observed the federal holiday for the first time on Jan.
15, King's actual birthday. King's birthday became the 10th
national holiday in 1986, eight years after he was assassinated in
Memphis, Tenn.
   The four states that do not recognize the federal holiday are
Arizona, Montana, Idaho and New Hampshire.
   The Legislature dropped Columbus Day, celebrated on the second
Monday in October, from Wyoming's list of legal paid holidays. The
House had added the amendment to prevent the state from having to
pay more to state employees who got the day off.

<TEXT>
   New President Patricio Aylwin pledged
respect for human rights Monday in a speech to a huge gathering
celebrating the rebirth of democracy in Chile, but indicated he
will avoid holding trials for past abuses.
   Singing, flag-waving, sometimes weeping Chileans packed the
82,000-seat National Stadium, five miles southeast of downtown
Santiago, to hear Aylwin _ a site that long served as a dark symbol
of bloody political repression.
   Aylwin, a 71-year-old centrist Christian Democrat, became
president Sunday, ending 16{ years of authoritarian rule by
right-wing Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
   On seizing power in a violent 1973 coup, Pinochet launched a
harsh anti-leftist campaign. Thousands of suspected dissidents were
rounded up and brought to National Stadium where, human rights
groups say, many were tortured and some were executed.
   Aylwin appeared on Monday to rule out vigorous prosecution and
punishment of military officers for abuses committed during
Pinochet's rule.
   He remarked at Monday's evening rally that ``in sorrowful days
of blind and hateful predominance of force over reason, it (the
stadium) was a place of confinement and torture for many
compatriots.''
   ``From this place ... we say to all Chileans and the world that
is watching us: Never again. Never again violations of human
dignity.''
   Aylwin promised to ``clarify the truth about the disappearances
of people, the horrendous crimes and other grave human rights
violations that occurred during the dictatorship.''
   But he called for ``tempering the virtue of justice with the
virtue of prudence'' and said, ``A time for forgiveness'' would
come.
   Chile, he said, must avoid ``becoming engulged indefinitely in
inquiries, recriminations and witch-hunts.''
   The issue is seen as one of the most politically sensitive to be
faced by Aylwin's administration.
   Pinochet, 74, keeps command of the 60,000-member army and has
said he will not permit the new government to prosecute military
officers for past offenses.
   Rights organizations and leftist groups, many of which supported
Aylwin's candidacy, are pressing for the trial and punishment of
offenders.
   According to rights groups, at least 700 people disappeared
during Pinochet's rule. They say thousands more were illegally
imprisoned, and many of them were tortured.
   Aylwin appealed on Monday for patience, saying ``there will be
difficulties because of obstacles and binds left behind for us by
the former regime.''
   Pinochet enacted last-minute laws and decrees trimming Aylwin's
powers and granting the military virtual autonomy. The new
government plans to eliminate or modify many of the laws, but
acknowledges this will slow down its efforts to address social
needs.
   A roar of applause greeted Aylwin as he entered the stadium
wearing the red, white and blue presidential sash and accompanied
by his wife, Leonor.
   He sat down among visiting heads of state and watched an
emotionally charged folk ceremony.
   Relatives of people who disappeared during military rule staged
a funeral dance and then marched across an open, brightly lighted
soccer field in folk costumes. They held up poster-sized
photographs of the victims, whose names scrolled down the
electronic scoreboard. Many had last been seen in the stadium.
   Many people wept openly in the stands.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Ertha Pascal-Trouillot, the first
and only woman on Haiti's 12-member Supreme Court and on the verge
of becoming Haiti's next president, has set precedents for women
throughout a brilliant legal career.
   Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot, 46, will be inaugurated Tuesday morning
as the first female to lead this troubled Caribbean nation since
independence from France in 1804.
   She previously was the first woman named to the executive
committee of the Haiti's Bar Association and the Appeals Court, and
has campaigned for equal rights for females.
   After serving as an appellate judge for two years, Mrs.
Pascal-Trouillot was appointed to the Supreme Court after the fall
of dictator Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier in February 1986 and
has maintained a reputation for political independence.
   Francois Latourte, a former justice minister, said he ``highly
recommended'' her to the Supreme Court after studying her record.
   ``She was a distinguished and competent judge, a remarkable
woman,'' said Latourte. ``I did not hesitate to recommend her as
the first woman justice.''
   She is the author of several books about law. Her best-known
work, ``The Judicial Status of Haitian Women in Social
Legislation,'' was written in 1973, two years after graduation from
law school. She is a member of the Association of French-Language
Writers.
   In the 1970s, she campaigned for equal rights at a time when
Haitian women were considered ``legal minors,'' a system under
which a married woman could not have a bank account and could not
buy property without her husband's written approval. The law has
since been changed.
   ``She has had a meteoric career,'' said Ernst Malbranche, former
president of the Haitian Bar Association.
   She is the widow of Ernst Trouillot, a distinguished lawyer who
presided over the Port-au-Prince Bar Association until his death in
1989. The couple had one daughter.
   The horror of the harsh Duvalier family rule touched Mrs.
Pascal-Trouillot in the late 1960s.
   Her brother, jazz guitarist Alix Pascal, was shot in the back in
Port-au-Prince during a rehearsal. The assailant was a Tonton
Macoute, the feared secret police of Francois ``Papa Doc''
Duvalier, Jean-Claude's father and predecessor.
   Left paralyzed, he now lives in New York City.
   When opposition parties nominated Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot Monday
to become provisional president, she took the news in stride.
   ``She was shocked but she expected it. We had told her,'' said
Jean-Claude Roy, a leading member of the Unity Assembly opposition
coalition.
   With the departure Monday to a Florida exile of military ruler
Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, reaction to the appointment of a woman to
replace him was favorable.
   ``The men in Haiti have messed up the country so much, we can
only expect her to do better,'' said Pierre Louis Gaillard, 48, an
unemployed mechanic.

<HEAD>President Dissolves Parliament, Parties Prepare for Elections</HEAD>

   President Christos Sartzetakis dissolved
Parliament on Monday, and Greece's political parties prepared for
their third battle after two inconclusive elections since June.
   A presidential decree posted next to Parliament's entrance
disbanded the 300-member legislature and scheduled elections for
April 8.
   The conservative New Democracy party, with 148 seats in the last
Parliament, is aiming for a majority in the elections. The
socialists, with 128 seats, and the Communists, with 21, appear
determined to prevent this. Three seats went to independents in
November.
   Premier Xenophon Zolotas will lead a caretaker government until
the elections. He was appointed by the conservative, socialist and
Communist parties to head an all-party government after Nov. 5
elections. But on Feb. 12, that government broke up, citing policy
differences.
   Zolotas had a mandate to tackle pressing economic problems. He
was expected to take drastic action in tackling a $12-billion
public-sector deficit.
   His government succeeded in cutting spending by about $6 billion
but did not raise revenues.
   In June elections, New Democracy beat former Premier Andreas
Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement, which had been in
power eight years.
   New Democracy formed a coalition with the Communists and
indicted Papandreou and several other senior socialists on
corruption charges.
   No trial dates were set, and a strong showing by the socialists
in November resulted in New Democracy again falling just short of a
parliamentary majority.
   Recent opinion polls do not show any significant swing in party
strengths, but New Democracy leader Constantine Mitsotakis says he
will no longer cooperate with other parties.
   ``You can't wage a battle with three field marshals,'' he told a
campaign rally on Lesbos island Sunday.
   However, the Communist-led Coalition of the Left and Progress,
reeling after the revolutionary changes in Eastern Europe, has
indicated it would form an alliance with the socialists.
   The Communists hinted last weekend they may field joint
candidates with the socialists in the five single-seat
constituencies that are traditionally the key to parliamentary
power.
   Given present party strengths, though, a socialist-Communist
alliance would hold only a slight parliamentary majority. Such a
government would have trouble making unpopular decisions.

   Prominent black Americans urged Secretary of
State James A. Baker III on Monday to provide up to $25 million in
U.S. aid to a leading anti-apartheid group in South Africa.
   The idea is to help the African National Congress begin planning
a new political structure for the country, Randall Robinson,
executive director of Transafrica, said.
   He cited as precedents U.S. assistance to the Polish labor
movement Solidarity and to the Nicarguan coalition headed by
Violeta Chamorro before they took control of their countries.
   Robinson said Baker's response at a 45-minute State Department
meeting was non-commital. At the same time, the Transafrica
official said, Baker disagreed with ``some sharpness'' to a request
to end U.S. support for Unita insurgents in Angola.
   The black group had asked Baker to recognize the Angolan
government, now that more than half the Cuban troops have departed.
   Robinson said supporting Unita, headed by Jonas Savimbi, puts
the United States in league with South Africa.
   The black visitors and Baker found themselves in accord on
several other issues. For instance, Robinson said, the Bush
administration will not ease economic sanctions against South
Africa and it will work with the Soviet Union and other nations to
try to help the hungry in Ethiopia.
   Unless channels for delivering food are opened quickly some 3{
million Ethiopians could starve, Robinson said.
   The black group proposed that President Bush ask Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev cooperate in seeking a cease-fire in
the African country between the Marxist government and separatist
Eritrean rebels.
   Robinson said Israel should be asked to stop arming the
government and Arab countries to stop aiding the rebels. Baker
agreed to propose the plan to President Bush, Robinson said.
   The delegation included the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Mrs. Coretta
Scott King, former Mayor Richard Hatcher of Gary, Ind., and Joseph
Lowery, head of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.
   Baker leaves Sunday to attend indepndence ceremonies in Namibia,
a former South African colony. He may also meet with leaders of the
South African government and black opposition groups.
   Robinson called the $500,000 in U.S. aid for Namibia this year
``paltry'' and suggested $15 million. Baker did not commit himself,
Robinson said.
   For next year, the Bush administration has proposed $7.8 million
for Namibia.

<HEAD>Kennedy Expects Trial of Chilean Officers in U.S. Killing</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Chile</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sen. Edward Kennedy said Monday he
expects the new democratic government to allow prosecution of two
military officers for the 1976 bomb-slaying of a prominent Chilean
dissident in Washington.
   The Massachusetts Democrat sponsored a 14-year-old congressional
ban on military weapons sales to Chile. It can only be lifted when
the 1976 assassination of Orlando Letelier is cleared up.
   ``I believe the overwhelming majority of the members of the
Senate _ of both parties, the Republican and Democratic _ want
those involved in government-sponsored terrorism brought to
justice, whether here in Chile or the United States,'' Kennedy told
a news conference. ``There is every expectation they will.''
   Since arriving Saturday, Kennedy has met with many top officials
in the new government of President Patricio Aylwin. The elected
civilian took power Sunday to end 16{ years of right-wing military
rule by Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
   Kennedy said it does not matter whether army Gen. Manuel
Contreras and army Col. Pedro Espinoza, both formerly top officials
in Pinochet's secret police, are tried in Chile or the United
States.
   Contreras and Espinoza were among several former secret police
implicated in the killing of Letelier. He died along with an
American assistant when a remote-control bomb blew up his car as it
rounded Dupont Circle on Washington's Embassy Row on Sept. 21, 1976.
   Chilean jurists and human rights officials say they consider it
extremely unlikely Contreras or Espinoza will ever face trial in a
U.S. court, despite indictments in Washington. The Chilean Supreme
Court rejected a U.S. request for their extradition in 1979.
   Letelier was a U.S. ambassador and held several cabinet posts in
the leftist government of elected President Salvador Allende, who
was toppled by Pinochet in a 1973 coup.

   A bronze bust of former Sen. J. William
Fulbright, D-Ark., was presented to the Kennedy Center on Monday to
commemorate his little-publicized role in the creation of the
national performing arts center on the banks of the Potomac River.
   Fulbright, 84, was accompanied by his bride of two days, the
former Hariet Mayor, to a small ceremony in an Opera House lounge.
``As ugly as I am, I think it's wonderful,'' he said of the bust by
sculptor Gretta Bader of Stanford, Calif.
   Fulbright recalled that he accompanied the Soviet ambassador to
a performance of the Bolshoi Ballet in a local movie theater in
1957. The theater was such a bad locale, he said, that he
introduced legislation the next day authorizing a national cultural
center in Washington.
   After Congress approved the bill in 1958, Kennedy Center
officials said, Fulbright ``provided extraordinary energy and
leadership'' during a turbulent period when questions of financial
support, construction site, architectural design and administration
of the center were debated.
   Roger L. Stevens, founding chairman of the Kennedy Center who
celebrated his 80th birthday Monday, said Fulbright's role had
never been fully recognized. ``If it had not been for people like
him, we would never have succeeded in making the Kennedy Center a
reality,'' he said.
   Fulbright said the center represents the ``extremely important''
role that the arts play in ``humanizing our society.''
   The center, which opened in 1971, is the only official national
memorial to John F. Kennedy, who was assassinated in 1963.
   Among the reception guests were J. Carter Brown, director of the
National Gallery of Art; Katharine Graham, chairman of The
Washington Post Co.; James H. Billington, librarian of Congress,
and Kennedy Center chairman Ralph Davidson.
   A partner in the Washington law firm of Hogan &amp; Hartson,
Fulbright is a former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee and was a vocal opponent of U.S. involvement in the
Vietnam War. His primary defeat in 1974 ended Fulbright's 30-year
Senate career.
   Last Saturday in his Washington home, Fulbright married Hariet
Mayor, 56, a longtime assistant and former executive director of
the Fulbright Association of Fulbright Scholars alumni.
   Fulbright's first wife, Betty, died in 1985. His bride is a
widow with three children and one grandson.
   The Fulbright bust was commissioned by the former senator's law
firm and is on permanent loan to the Kennedy Center from the
National Portrait Gallery. It will be displayed outside the box
tier of the center's Opera House.

   Federal regulators should think about moving
stock trading off exchange floors to computer screens, a report to
Congress said Monday. The regulators said they weren't convinced.
   The General Accounting Office, the auditing and investigative
agency of Congress, said the Securities and Exchange Commission
should consider a proposal to repeal a New York Stock Exchange rule
requiring trades of most listed stocks to be executed on the
exchange floor.
   A rule that forbids after-hours trading of listed stocks, which
tends to push after-hours trading to foreign exchanges, also should
be reviewed, the report said.
   Trading rules were eased in 1979 to permit off-floor trading of
newly listed stocks. But, a decade later, most stocks still were
initially listed before 1979. Trades of 89 of the New York Stock
Exchange's 100 most active shares still must be routed through the
exchange floor.
   The GAO, noting the rapid evolution of computer and
communications technology, said it is time for the commission to
reconsider rules banning most off-floor trading.
   The commission disagreed, saying its 1979 study of off-floor
trading was complex and that it would not dismantle the floor
system until market participants determine a new system would be
better than the old.
   On the New York Stock Exchange, the nation's principal exchange,
brokers bring orders to a specific spot on the floor designated for
trading in the stock they are buying or selling.
   There they must deal by ``open outcry'' with other floor
brokers, if there are any. If there are none others, the broker
seeking to trade may deal with a ``specialist,'' another broker
charged by the exchange with standing ready to buy or sell at all
times.
   Critics contend that the use of trading floors and specialists
restricts price competition.
   Supporters of the current system, however, argue that a central
location for trading preserves the benefits of an auction market.
   In trading by computer, a broker lists bids or offerings on a
screen for others to accept or reject, changing prices as he or she
sees fit.
   The SEC agreed that a review of after-hours trading was in order
even though, in 1986, the commission rejected a recommendation from
its staff that the agency ask the New York Stock Exchange to
consider it.
   ``As a result ... exchange member brokers and dealers who wish
to trade exchange-listed stocks when U.S. markets are closed must
do so in foreign markets,'' the GAO said.
   The report, dated Monday, was delivered to the Senate Banking
Committee and the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

<HEAD>Cheney Is Told Western Europe Under Pressure to Cut Defense</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Western European governments are under
pressure from public opinion to cut their military forces
drastically, Dutch Defense Minister Aurelus ter Beek told Defense
Secretary Richard Cheney Monday.
   ``All ministers of defense have to take the heat in this way,''
he told reporters later. ``All ministers of defense do feel
pressures from public opinion on them to achieve drastic cuts.''
   Ter Beek belongs to the Labor Party in the Netherlands, which
like other Social Democratic groups traditionally puts less
emphasis on defense than do conservative parties.
   He warned Cheney against too long a delay in calling a second
conference on reductions in forces after the one now going on in
Vienna.
   ``Some or several countries might be tempted or even forced to
lead the way,'' he said.
   He noted that the U.S. government is hoping for an agreement in
general terms by June. He himself would like to see a formal treaty
in the second half of the year.
   Ter Beek said that the parties in his own coalition government
have agreed to find about $1.5 billion in reductions of military
spending in the next five years. He said a paper on the country's
defense in the 1990s will be issued at the end of the year.
   He went on to say that he prefers to make cuts in the present
framework of 23 governments, including the United States.
   ``European countries will of course be interested in the best
way the American commitment to the defense of Europe can be
symbolized ... after a partial withdrawal of American troops,'' he
said.
   He said other countries have accepted the ``two plus four''
formula under which the two Germanys will negotiate unification,
followed by talks with the four main victors of World War II: the
United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France.
   But he called for close consultations on other subjects, such as
the number of Soviet troops who will remain in eastern Europe, the
value of the Warsaw Pact after free elections in its member
countries, the future of foreign troops in West Germany including
the present Dutch brigade, the future strategy of the alliance and
the role of nuclear weapopns in it.
   The stationing of troops should be a decision of the North
Atlantic alliance, he said.
   Ter Beek's message on consultations was similar to the one
brought to Washington last week by Italian Prime Minister Giulio
Andreotti.

   Record warm weather surging northward caused dense fog Monday in
which 52 vehicles crashed on a Wisconsin bridge, and runoff from
violent weekend thunderstorms caused flooding on the southern
Plains.
   Temperatures rose into the 60s as far north as North Dakota, and
Washington, D.C., posted a high of 87, the warmest on record for
any day in March. The early warmth threatened to make Washington's
cherry trees bloom too early for the annual Cherry Blossom
Festival, scheduled to begin April 1.
   In the West, northern Utah cleaned up after the heaviest snow of
the season. Following a spring-like Saturday with temperatures near
60, a storm dumped 10 inches of snow on the Salt Lake Valley on
Sunday, with about a foot of snow on ski resorts.
   ``Historically, March is a change-of-seasons month, so you have
a wide variety of weather,'' said Dewey Jobe, meteorologist with
the National Weather Service in Bismarck, N.D., which expected
highs in the 60s in the southeast and snow during the night in the
northwest.
   A teen-ager drowned after he fell into a raging creek in Texas,
a canoeist was missing on a swollen river in Wisconsin, and three
people were killed in the 52-vehicle pileup in Wisconsin.
   The unsettled weather on the southern Plains kept the space
shuttle Atlantis grounded at Fort Bliss, Texas, delaying its
piggyback flight back to Florida atop a Boeing 747, NASA officials
said Monday. The twinned craft landed Sunday for refueling.
   Dense fog caused by the warm air flowing over snow and frozen
ground was reported from North Dakota into Michigan, reducing
visibility to zero in places and delaying planes at airports.
   Visibility was ``just about down to zero'' at the time of the
accident on a bridge at Green Bay, Wis., said Police Lt. Roy
Johnson. In addition to the dead, hospital officials said 30 people
were treated.
   ``The catalyst was a three-car accident. How that happened I
don't know. From there it was a chain-reaction. It just piled up,''
Deputy Chief of Traffic Robert Kreuser said. ``In my 28 years of
service with the Green Bay police department, this is the worst
I've ever seen.''
   Elsewhere in Wisconsin, flooding was caused by a combination of
rain and rapidly melting snow, and frozen ground that prevented
water from soaking in. Fire department officials in the village of
Plover, near Stevens Point, had to sandbag some homes Sunday to
prevent flooding, and some roads remained under water Monday, said
village Clerk Emma Jane Lee.
   Up to 2{ inches of rain plus snowmelt also flooded homes in
several areas of Minnesota, including Minneapolis. Basement walls
collapsed in some homes. Cars were abandoned on Interstate 94 in
Minneapolis after they stalled in standing water, according to the
State Patrol.
   In Maple Grove, Minn., a canoeist was reported helping rescue
motorists stranded by high water.
   Authorities in the eastern Illinois city of Danville worked to
restore water service to some 55,000 customers after it was halted
by flooding that began Saturday. Schools and most restaurants
remained closed.
   Bismark, Alvin and north Danville areas along the North Fork
River had the most severe flooding, officials said. About 200
people had been forced from their homes and remained out Monday.
   Heavy thunderstorms battered parts of Texas, Oklahoma and
Arkansas and caused flooding Sunday and Monday.
   Flooding continued in parts of central and northeastern
Oklahoma, closing some highways, and at least a half-dozen schools
called off classes, officials say.
   Gilford Hopkins, assistant fire chief in Skiatook, Okla., said
that water from Bird Creek was ``up in and around'' about 60 homes
and 10 businesses.
   A police dispatcher in Guthrie said water got into about a dozen
businesses. In Bartlesville, about a dozen people sought shelter
Sunday when water creeped up to their homes.
   In Arkansas, the Ouachita River pushed past 39 feet early Monday
and stopped rising just in time to spare Camden from significant
property damage and evacuations, officials said. Four families were
evacuated.
   ``It was close for some of the houses. Some lacked six inches,
10 inches of getting water in their homes,'' said Niolan Spain of
office of emergency services.
   In southwestern Fort Worth, Texas, which received about 2 inches
of rain, several dozen residents were evacuated because a drainage
creek overflowed. Cars were fender-deep in water and mattresses
floated in flooded bedrooms at some residences.
   ``It happened so fast, you didn't have time to do anything,''
said Manuel Martinez, whose home was flooded.
   Fort Worth Meacham Airport recorded 4.55 inches of rain Sunday
and sections of Cooke County recorded 4 inches.

<TEXT>
   A key prosecution witness in a racial attack
that claimed the life of a black teen-ager was charged with
second-degree murder Monday after refusing to cooperate with
prosecutors.
   John Vento, who disappeared for three months but later
resurfaced, was charged after he said he would not testify against
friends charged with the slaying last August in the Bensonhurst
section of Brooklyn.
   Seven other young white men from Bensonhurst have been charged
in the shooting of 16-year-old Yusuf Hawkins.
   Brooklyn District Attorney Charles J. Hynes said Vento, 21, was
arrested in his office and ordered held for arraignment. A
spokesman for Hynes, Patrick Clark, said a grand jury would
investigate the charges against Vento.
   Vento's lawyer, Gerald DiChiara, said Vento ``has reasons I
could not argue against. ... He is very concerned for everything _
his family, himself.''
   DiChiara declined to elaborate.
   Hynes said he still has a ``trial ready'' case without Vento.
But a prosecutor who spoke on condition of anonymity called Vento's
defection ``a major blow.''
   ``He (Vento) was in the middle of the group, and he was going to
testify,'' the prosecutor told The Associated Press.
   Vento, who acknowledged he was present during the attack,
initially agreed to testify before a grand jury and at trial in
exchange for a pledge he would not be charged in the attack.
   He disappeared late last year and surrendered last week to
federal authorities in Dayton, Ohio. His absence forced a monthlong
delay in the start of the first trials.
   Following Vento's arrest, Hynes said he was still willing to
honor the agreement and gave Vento until Monday to say whether he
would abide by the deal.
   Earlier in the day, Brooklyn state Supreme Court Justice
Thaddeus Owens refused to set bail for Joseph Fama, the youth
accused of doing the actual shooting. He said the case would go to
trial next month as scheduled.
   Hawkins was killed Aug. 23 when a mob of some 30 young whites _
many armed with baseball bats _ attacked him and three black
friends when they went to the mainly white Bensonhurst neighborhood
to look at a car that was for sale.

<HEAD>Christie's Reverses Policy on Auction Guarantees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Christie's changed a longstanding policy Monday,
and guaranteed a minimum price to the sellers of Vincent van Gogh's
``Self Portrait'' and four other paintings being auctioned on May
15.
   The auction house said the paintings by Van Gogh, Pierre-Auguste
Renoir, Amedeo Modigliani and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec have been
given a presale estimate of $40 million to $60 million, with Van
Gogh's work valued at between $20 million and $30 million.
   The heirs of financier and art collector Robert Lehman, who are
offering the paintings for sale, will be guaranteed a minimum price
regardless of the bids offered, the auction house said. The minimum
was not disclosed.
   ``The firm's concern about the possible negative impact of
guaranteed sales on the art market is well-known,'' the auction
house said in a statement. ``However, Christie's is aware of the
guarantee's appeal to certain client segments.''
   Christie's managing director, Christopher Davidge, said that
during the past year ``we have in certain cases found it difficult
to compete (for art sellers' business) without offering
guarantees.''
   ``Thus, Christie's has in this case decided to guarantee,'' he
said.
   Davidge would not say how often Christie's planned to offer
guarantees to other sellers.
   Christie's has long criticized rival auction house Sotheby's for
making guarantees, saying the practice can artificially inflate the
art market. Guarantees, particularly when they are not announced,
can also give an auction house a conflict of interest.

<BYLINE>Tapes of Conversations Between Brothers and Therapist
^By MICHAEL FLEEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two brothers charged with killing
their millionaire parents delayed entering pleas Monday to give
their lawyers time to review the seizure of evidence from the
brothers' psychologist.
   Attorneys for Erik and Lyle Menendez said they wanted to
determine if tape recordings seized from Jerome Oziel were
inadmissible in court in what appears to be a key issue developing
in the case.
   ``The concern is that, it is my understanding, that when you
talk to a therapist, that that's privileged _ as if you were
talking to a lawyer _ and that privilege might be breached,'' said
defense attorney Gerald Chaleff.
   The tapes of conversations between Oziel and the brothers were
seized last Thursday, the day police arrested Lyle, 22, and
launched an international search for Erik, 19, a tennis pro who
surrendered over the weekend.
   District Attorney Ira Reiner called the tapes ``key evidence''
in the Aug. 20, 1989, shotgun slayings of Hollywood executive Jose
Menendez, 45, and Mary Louise ``Kitty'' Menendez, 44.
   Reiner alleged that money was the motive in the killings. The
brothers, who reported finding their parent's bodies in their
Beverly Hills mansion, stood to inherit the $14 million estate of
Jose Menendez, a successful executive of Live Entertainment Inc., a
Los Angeles-based video distribution company.
   Defense attorneys said they wanted to read the search warrant
affidavit that authorities filed before they searched Oziel's
office. The affidavit, which may indicate what is on the tapes,
were ordered sealed by the judge to everyone except attorneys in
the case.
   State law allows a psychologists' patient records to be used as
evidence if there is a threat of continued violence, and Deputy
District Attorney Elliot Alhadeff said Oziel was threatened.
   Alhadeff would not elaborate and Oziel declined to return a
phone message to his Beverly Hills office.
   Chaleff said he had no information of a threat against the
psychologist or anyone else.
   The Menendez brothers' arraignment was rescheduled for March 26,
when they will enter pleas and Municipal Court Judge Judith O.
Stein will decide whether to release the affidavit.
   Attorneys and the prosecutor discussed the affidavit and other
matters behind closed doors Monday for more than an hour before the
brothers appeared in court.
   The brothers listened to Stein read the charges against them:
two counts of murder with special circumstance allegations that
could make them eligible for the death penalty if they are
convicted.
   When asked if they understood the charges, the brothers each
answered, ``Yes, your honor.''
   Sitting in the courtroom were Maria Llanio, the mother of victim
Jose Menendez, and Jose's sister, Teresita Baralt and her husband
Carlos. The Baralts are executors of the Menendez estate.
   Family members declined to comment, but defense attorney Robert
Shapiro said, ``Family members are united in support of both these
boys.''
   Reiner, in a news conference prior to the brothers' court
appearance, insisted that the taped conversations were not the only
evidence his office had in the case.
   He said there was other ``physical evidence,'' which he would
not identify.

   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega
promised Vice President Dan Quayle Monday he will peacefully
relinquish power April 25, Quayle said.
   Ortega, confirming the commitment, said he told Quayle the best
way to ensure a peaceful transfer of power was that ``the Contras
cease to exist by April 25,'' and that Quayle assured him the
United States would ``seek ways of supporting the idea.''
   Aides to the vice president said Ortega was referring to an
expected U.S. aid package that would, among other things, provide
funds for resettling the rebel fighters.
   Ortega also assured the vice president that all cabinet
ministers, including the defense minister and interior minister in
charge of the Sandinista-dominated army and police, will be
appointed by Violeta Chamorro, the U.S.-backed candidate who beat
Ortega in the Feb. 25 election, Quayle said.
   Ortega sought out Quayle at a 1{-hour lunch hosted by newly
inaugurated Chilean President Patricio Aylwin in the presidential
palace after arranging in two brief earlier chats to talk further.
   Later in the day, Quayle flew to Asuncion for an 18-hour visit,
the first in 32 years by a high-ranking U.S. official to Paraguay,
a dictatorship until 1989. Quayle was met by an honor guard and
President Gen. Andres Rodriguez under a giant red-and-white banner
of welcome.
   Two hours after Quayle's arrival, members of a half-dozen
leftist groups gathered on a downtown street to wave anti-Quayle
signs and listen to speeches denouncing imperlialism. Police
watched but did not intervene.
   Before leaving Santiago, Quayle told reporters his talk with
Ortega had been ``cordial and productive''
   ``He guaranteed me two things,'' Quayle said. ``One, on April 25
he will turn over his presidency to Violetta Chamorro. Two, he
guaranteed to me that Violetta Chamorro will appoint all ministers,
including the defense minister and the interior minister.''
   Ortega also asked that the Bush administration immediately lift
the economic sanctions imposed by the United States during his
Sandinista regime, said other officials who briefed reporters on
condition of anonymity.
   Quayle assured him the administration already was actively
considering the same request made by Mrs. Chamorro, the officials
said.
   Meanwhile, administration sources in Washington said Bush will
ask Congress for a quick $300 million to support Chamorro. Sources
declining to be named publicly said that Bush is expected to
announce the request as early as Tuesday. The proposal would
include some $30 million to help relocate the Contra rebels into
their homeland, they said.
   Quayle's aides said that while Ortega has said repeatedly the
Contras must be disbanded before power is to be transferred, he did
not make that a condition to his Monday promise of peaceful
transition.
   Quayle himself did not answer a question on whether Ortega
imposed any conditions, but his aides later repeated what they said
before, that Ortega had not.
   Ortega himself, encountering reporters in his hotel, said, ``I
commited to him that the process of transfer of power was going to
take place with the utmost normality. The best thing for that
purpose would be that the Contras cease to exist by April 25.''
   Quayle said Ortega told him, ``I want to make the transfer in
Nicaragua more peaceful than the transfer in Chile,'' where a
civilian government was inaugurated over the weekend to bring a
16-year military dictatorship to a peaceful end.
   Officials traveling with Quayle said the vice president brought
up possible use of United Nations' peacekeeping troops to help
prevent outbreaks of fighting between the Contra rebels and
Sandinista loyqlists.
   Ortega indicated that would be fine ``if they are willing to
take the risk,'' the aides said. They quoted Quayle as replying,
``We better take a risk for peace.''
   The luncheon conversation took place after Ortega walked up and
asked Costa Rican President Oscar Arias, who was seated next to
Quayle, to trade places with him.
   Ortega later characterized the discussion as ``frank, friendly
and constructive.'' He had previously made a strong point of
insisting that the Contras be demobilized at once.
   The U.S position also favors disbanding the rebel army, but the
Bush administration has insisted the rebels be given security
guarantees before they lay down their arms.
   The occasion of the inauguration set the stage for an
unprecedented faceoff _ Quayle holding official talks with the
Sandinista leader the United States had shunned for a decade.
   Their meeting in Moneda, the official presidential palace, came
as a new wave of diplomacy on Nicaragua picked up steam. Several
heads of state used the inauguration to discuss how to bring a
peaceful transition of power following the election Ortega lost to
Mrs. Chamorro.
   Arias joined Ortega in announcing that a meeting of Central
American presidents will be held at the end of the month to discuss
ways to bring about a smooth and peaceful transition in Managua.
   Quayle and Ortega were joined in a 10-minute session by
Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez.
   Perez told Quayle _ in Ortega's presence _ that Ortega had
assured him he would hand over power to Mrs. Chamorro even if the
Contra issue is not resolved, said a Quayle aide. The assistant
briefed reporters on the condition that he not be publicly
identified.
   This aide, however, also quoted Quayle telling Ortega: ``You
can't make unilateral emobilization of the Contras a precondition
for the transfer of power.''
   The aide said the vice president also complained about
Sandinista helicopter attacks on Contras observing a cease-fire.
   After first chatting at Mass, Quayle and Ortega met at a lunch
hosted by Aylwin. It was the first such high-level official U.S.
discussion with the Nicaraguan leftist.
   Arias said that Quayle concurred when Arias suggested the
Contras should receive no U.S. money to repatriate until they lay
down their arms.
   ``What I said to him was, `Unless the Contras disarm, they
shouldn't get any money for their repatriation. That's a good
carrot for them,''' Arias told reporters as he left a hotel where
he met the vice presidents.
   ``He agreed with me,'' Arias said of Quayle.
   But Quayle's chief of staff, Bill Kristol, later said Quayle
agreed only that there should be incentives for the Contras to
disband _ not that they should disarm or lose repatriation money.
   The incentives, Kristol said, will be in the Nicaraguan aid
package the administration is scheduled to announce later this
week. And the chief of staff said Quayle insisted there be security
guarantees for the Contras.
   The United States has avoided high level contacts with Ortega,
holding that his government should negotiate with the Contras
directly rather than with the United States.
   At the Venezuelan inauguration last year, Quayle stayed away
from Ortega.
   When President Bush and Ortega were together in a multi-lateral
session at last October's celebration of Costa Rican democracy,
Bush also avoided any substantive talk with the Nicaraguan.
   He referred to him later as a ``little man'' who was trying to
sidle up for a photo opportunity with the American president.

   Los Angeles Raiders owner Al Davis said
Monday he wants to bring the National Football League team back to
the city he abandoned eight years ago.
   Davis, breaking a long silence on the issue, called local
officials to lend his support to Oakland's offer.
   The proposal, which guarantees Davis' Raiders $602 million over
15 years, now needs only the approval of the City Council and
Alameda County supervisors.
   ``He's ready, and we're ready,'' said Mayor Lionel Wilson.
``This is an eventful day in history for this city.''
   The separate votes were scheduled for Monday night following a
hearing, but the possibility that testimony would be lengthy
threatened to force a vote postponement.
   If Davis, the Raiders' managing general partner, had said no
Monday or failed to call by a noon deadline, the deal would have
been off.
   The NFL formally requires approval by three-fourths of team
owners of any move, as well as written notification by Jan. 15 of
the year of the proposed relocation. But in practice, the league
poses no further obstacles if the city and county approve the offer.
   Davis moved the Raiders from Oakland to Los Angeles without
permission, and won his case in court, and Robert Irsay moved the
Colts without approval from Baltimore to Indianapolis in 1984. NFL
owners did approve the 1988 transfer of the Cardinals franchise
from St. Louis to Phoenix.
   The Raiders' lease with the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum runs
through the 1991 season, but it's possible Davis could seek a
settlement enabling him to return to Oakland sooner.
   Officials in Los Angeles worked through the weekend to put
together a counteroffer, but were pessimistic about their chances.
   ``It looks like we're going to lose the Raiders,'' said Ed
Snider, lead negotiator for the Los Angeles Coliseum's private
managers. ``It's a damn shame. I haven't given up, but I fear we're
a day late and a dollar short.''
   Oakland's offer includes a loan package totaling $121 million to
the team. It proposes $53.5 million to renovate the Oakland
Coliseum and the rest a ``loan'' Davis does not have to repay.
   Davis also would be guaranteed ticket revenues of at least $29
million a year for the life of the 15-year lease. He would receive
the basic $30 ticket price from at least 57,000 seats, with the
city and county taking the premium payments above that for certain
categories of seats.
   He also would keep all television, which currently is $32
million a year.
   For the city and county to make money, the team must average 90
percent of capacity in a renovated Coliseum that will hold 63,500.
About 37,000 seats will cost more than the $30 base ticket price;
many require fans to pay $2,000 to $16,000 up front.
   In light of those requirements, many local officials question
whether there are enough sports fan dollars in the Bay area to
support another pro team.
   ``This deal is a gamble not worth getting into,'' said city
councilman Wilson Riles Jr. ``The risks are just too high.''
   If the Raiders return, they must compete with three championship
professional teams _ the Oakland Athletics, San Francisco 49ers and
San Francisco Giants _ and a fourth, the Warriors, that routinely
sells out.

   A local radio station's program director
admitted Monday his tale of hiring an unemployed draftsman who
advertised his job search on a Boston billboard was a hoax.
   Ron Valeri, programming director for radio station WAAF, said he
and others at the station lied repeatedly in a bid to outdo their
local radio competitor, radio station WBCN.
   But Valeri said the publicity stunt, which ran on The Associated
Press wire and garnered national attention, ran amok. ``We did
definitely lose control. ... This thing got away from us,'' he said.
   Valeri and his new employee, Bill Whiteman, told interviewers
from various local and national news organizations that the disc
jockey was hired because of his eye-catching plea on a Boston
billboard: ``Help! I Need A Job!''
   The billboard ad did go up, but Valeri admitted Monday that he
knew of Whiteman's prior experience as a broadcaster at radio
station WRCK in Utica, N.Y., ``a couple of weeks'' before he
discussed the hiring with reporters.
   ``Initially WAAF set up a publicity stunt in an attempt to
bamboozle its competitor. We were successful in doing that,''
Valeri said. ``What we didn't count on at the time was that local
media would jump on the story simultaneously.''
   Calls to radio station WBCN, the local competition against which
the WAAF stunt was aimed, went unanswered Monday evening.

   Demonstrators threw sticks and stones at police
during a protest Monday night at a London borough hall over
Britain's new tax, officials said. Several people were injured,
including some officers, and 45 were arrested, police said.
   Protests have been occurring around Britain over the new tax,
which will fund locally controlled spending. The uproar over the
tax has contributed to a slide in the popularity of Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government.
   Three hundred police, some on horseback, confronted about 1,500
protesters in the northeast London borough of Islington Monday as
the area council met to set the local tax rate.
   Police said 20 or 30 people started to snake through the crowd
and push demonstrators into police lines.
   ``Then sticks and stones were thrown at the mounted police as
(police) reinforcements went into the crowd,'' said an unidentified
senior officer.
   ``The majority of the crowd were engaged in noisy but peaceful
protest,'' said police Commander David Stevens. ``But a minority
were taking part in violent protest.''
   Several policemen and demonstrators were injured, authorities
said. They said they arrested 45.
   Inside the hall, council leader Margaret Hodge told the meeting
local retirees had been afraid to come express their views for fear
of violence. It was a sad day for democracy, she said.
   Her speech, relayed outside, was continually interrupted by
about 50 people in the hall's public gallery. They threw toilet
paper and paper airplanes into the chamber.
   The new tax takes effect April 1 in England and Wales. The new
per-capita levy replaces a household tax called ``the rates.''
   The government calls the new tax the ``community charge.'' But
the socialist opposition Labor Party and other critics have dubbed
it the ``poll tax'' after a per-capita tax that set off a peasants'
revolt in 1381.
   The government pushed through the new tax with a mind to
embarrassing Labor-controlled local councils by making them more
accountable for their spending. However, the move has backfired.
   With opposition to the tax riding high, the Conservative Party
is trailing Labor by up to 19 points in opinion polls. The next
general election is due by mid-1992.
   Low-income and disabled people can get rebates of up to 80
percent on the next tax. But critics say the new tax is unfair
because it otherwise takes no account of an individual's ability to
pay.
   The new tax is already in force in Scotland, with widespread
protest there. Northern Ireland, a British province, has a separate
system of local funding.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Deposed ruler Lt. Gen. Prosper
Avril flew to Florida in exile Monday and the army caved in to
civilian opposition demands that he be replaced with the first
woman president in Haiti's troubled history.
   In a ceremony at army headquarters carried on Haitian state
television, opposition leaders gave the Army High Command a letter
nominating Supreme Court Justice Ertha Pascal-Trouillot, 46, as
provisional president.
   Maj. Gen. Herard Abraham, the army chief of staff to whom Avril
handed control after resigning Saturday, said he hoped to turn over
power by Tuesday ``so that the people can have a government of
their choice.''
   ``I am very happy that the Haitian people with their army were
able to achieve this,'' said Abraham, who appeared on a
second-floor balcony of army headquarters with opposition leaders.
He did not mention Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot by name, but clearly
indicated the army accepted her nomination to lead Haiti, the
Western Hemisphere's poorest country.
   Wild cheers broke out from the crowd, which chanted ``Liberty!
Liberty!''
   Excluding Avril and Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, who assumed power
when dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to France four years ago,
Haiti has had 38 presidents, nearly all military, since 1804.
Haiti, the first slave nation to become independent, has also had
two emperors, one king and a governor-general. The army wielded
such political clout that the Duvalier dynasty created the dread
secret police, the Tonton Macoutes, to offbalance the regular army.
   Until now, no civilian opposition has taken control of the
government without the military playing a major role.
   Unity Assembly, the opposition coalition that put forward Mrs.
Pascal-Trouillot, announced on radio she would be inaugurated at
the Palace of Justice at 10 a.m. Tuesday.
   The coalition also said a general strike it called for Monday
before Avril left this impoverished Caribbean country of 5.1
million residents would end at midnight.
   The provisional government is to prepare Haiti, which shares the
island of Hispaniola with the Dominican Republic, for national
elections.
   Avril and his family arrived aboard a U.S. C-141 transport plane
at Homestead Air Force Base, 25 miles south of Miami, at 8:20 a.m.
and left at 3:30 p.m. _ destination unknown. A U.S. government
official speaking on condition of anonymity said Avril left Florida.
   Avril's departure followed a week of political turmoil that left
at least 24 people dead. His military government ruled Haiti _
often harshly _ for 18 months.
   Thousands of people milled about this capital city of 1 million,
which had been deserted before Avril's departure because of the
violence.
   Youths danced to meringue music featuring revolutionary themes
such as ``The General's Gone'' and ``Uproot the Killers.'' The mood
of the city, however, appeared to be one of disbelief _ not
jubilation.
   Radio stations reported instances of youths building flaming
barricades and pillaging a government food warehouse, but the
incidents were far from the bloody clashes of the previous seven
days.
   On Monday, the Unity Assembly, an opposition coalition
instrumental in Avril's downfall, submitted its choice of Mrs.
Pascal-Trouillot _ the only woman on the 12-member Supreme Court _
to the Army High Command. Unity members said Abraham agreed to
accept whoever they chose.
   The interim president is to govern along with a 19-member
advisory council until elections are held, possibly in three to six
months.
   The army's first choice had been Supreme Court Chief Justice
Gilbert Austin, an Avril appointee, but the Unity Assembly rejected
him, saying he was too closely tied to the deposed regime.
   Opposition leaders stood firm in three days of intense
negotiations with the army and threatened further disruptions and
strikes unless their choice for the presidency prevailed. Finally
the army agreed to accept Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot. Austin was out of
the picture, as was anyone else deemed to be too closely associated
with Avril.
   Austin refused the presidency, his wife said in a radio
interview. ``The people and the parties didn't want him, so to not
block the country, he decided not to accept,'' she said.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the Bush
administration was ``hopeful for a smooth transition to democracy
in Haiti. ... We are encouraging that effort.''
   He refused to say whether the United States will grant Avril
asylum.
   Fitzwater said the Bush administration ``had discussions with
Avril about the transition. ... (There) was a feeling of some
obligation to help him leave and facilitate a peaceful transition.''
   Sylvio Claude, a prominent Haitian politician, said it was too
early to predict whether army hard-liners would resist the transfer
of power to a civilian-led government.
   ``Last night, there were lots of threats,'' he said, referring
to fears by opposition leaders that soldiers might hunt them down.
   Haiti has been led mostly by military governments since
independence from France 186 years ago, including Avril and Namphy,
who assumed power when dictator ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier fled in
February 1986.
   The army wielded such political clout that the Duvalier dynasty
created the dread secret police, the Tonton Macoutes, as a
paramilitary force.
   When Duvalier fled into exile in France four years ago, ending
the 29-year dynasty begun by his father, the late Francois ``Papa
Doc,'' hopes rose for democracy, but the military held onto power.
   Avril took over in a September 1988 soldiers' revolt against
Namphy. Under Namphy, the nation's first free general elections
were aborted when thugs, protected by soldiers, killed at least 34
voters.
   Namphy organized army-run, fraudulent elections in January 1988
in which university professor Leslie Manigat was declared the
winner. Namphy ousted Manigat five months later, before suffering
the same fate that September.

   The Society of Professional Journalists on Monday
condemned the captivity of journalist Terry Anderson as physical
and mental torture on the eve of the fifth anniversary of his
kidnapping in Lebanon.
   ``Journalists are outraged by Terry Anderson's continued
captivity,'' Carolyn S. Carlson, president of the journalists'
group, said in a statement.
   Anderson, the chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, was taken hostage in Beirut on March 16, 1985. He has been
held captive longer than any other Westerner in Lebanon.
   The group's statement noted that the anniversary ironically
falls on Friday, national Freedom of Information day.
   ``Reporters for U.S. publications and broadcast outlets have
been injured, killed or kidnapped while trying to gather
information about international affairs so that their readers and
their audiences can understand better what goes on outside our
boundaries,'' said Ms. Carlson, an Associated Press newswoman in
Atlanta.
   ``That such an endeavor is so dangerous should remind us all how
lucky we are to have a system of government that secures the
existence of a free press.''

   Rival Christian forces traded sniper fire
Monday in Christian east Beirut, killing a soldier and wounding
three people, police said.
   They said troops of renegade Gen. Michel Aoun and militiamen of
Samir Geagea's Lebanese Forces also fired occasional
rocket-propelled grenades into each other's positions in east
Beirut's districts of Ashrafiyeh and Badaro.
   The army man was killed in the Aoun-controlled National Museum
district near Beirut's Green Line, dividing the city into Christian
and Moslem sectors, according to police.
   They said the other casualties, including a Lebanese Forces
militiaman and a child, were wounded by .50-caliber heavy
machine-gun fire from Aoun positions in Sin el-Fil.
   That raised to 755 killed and 2,097 wounded the overall toll
from the fighting that broke out Jan. 30 for control of the
310-square-mile Christian enclave.
   Monday's skirmishes further strained a 9-day-old cease-fire.

   Real estate magnate Harry Helmsley, the husband
of Leona Helmsley, fell down a flight of stairs and was
hospitalized Monday, a hospital official said.
   ``I understand that he fell but he is in good condition,'' said
Amy Weinstein, administrator at New York University-Cornell Medical
Center.
   WNYW-TV first reported Monday night that Helmsley fell down a
flight of stairs in his apartment at the Park Lane Hotel. The
accident, which occurred at about 1:30 p.m., happened as he was
exercising with his physical therapist.
   Helmsley, 81, was deemed incompetent to stand trial in federal
court on charges of income tax evasion. His wife, Leona, was
convicted on charges of conspiracy, tax evasion and fraud. She was
ordered to pay $7.5 million in fines and to serve four years in
prison. Mrs. Helmsley is free pending an appeal.

<HEAD>Noriega Attorney Demands Government Release Captured Documents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An attorney for Manuel Antonio Noriega said Monday
the government should release documents captured in Panama that
show the ousted dictator had helped the United States catch dozens
of drug traffickers.
   Attorney Steven Kollin told U.S. Magistrate William Turnoff he
wants to see documents from the office of the Panamanian
investigative service, that country's equivalent of the FBI.
   The documents have been under U.S. government control since U.S.
forces deposed Noriega in the December invasion of Panama.
   After the hearing, Kollin said the documents were important
because they established that Noriega and Panama's defense forces
had cooperated with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and
other law enforcement agencies ``up to the day of the invasion.''
   Noriega is accused in a February 1988 federal indictment of
running drugs and protecting Colombian drug shipments to the United
States between 1982 and 1986.
   Kollin said he was sure he would win access to the documents,
but may have to press harder to obtain a court order. Turnoff, who
has become a referee in a dispute between the government and
Noriega over the former general's personal property and papers, did
not rule Monday on Kollin's request.
   Noriega's attorneys contend that prosecutors have been slow in
producing his property for inspection, while prosecutors say
they've been moving as fast as they can.
   The government said Monday it has completed an inventory of
Noriega's holdings and turned the lists over to the defense.
   The court gave the defense four weeks to look over the inventory
so Noriega's attorneys can determine which of his belongings are
available as evidence.
   Prosecutors said they will be turning over some items to the
Panamanian government that are not considered evidence.
   Kollin, however, protested, contending that international law
prohibits the confiscation of private property during an invasion.
``The proper party to turn these over to is the legal
representative, meaning myself,'' he said.

   Former Haitian dictator
Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier and his wife Michele Bennett
obtained a divorce last year in the Dominican Republic, her lawyer
said Monday.
   The couple, who fled Haiti to exile in France after being forced
out of power during a mass uprising in February 1986, were granted
a divorce Oct. 24 in Samana, a tourist resort 186 miles from the
Dominican capital Santo Domingo.
   Attorney Luz Duquela Morales, who represented Mrs. Duvalier,
said the decision to divorce was ``mutual.'' The couple married in
1980.
   Judge Baez Barba granted custody of the couple's two children,
Nicolas and Anya, to Michele Bennett and under terms of the
divorce, Duvalier agreed to pay his ex-wife $3,000 in monthly child
support payments and $4,500 in monthly alimony.
   Duvalier, the 39-year-old son of former President-for-Life
Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier, was represented by Dominican
attorney Manuel Ramon Morel Cerda, according to the Dominican daily
``Ultima Hora,'' which reported the divorce Monday.
   Both lawyers said neither Duvalier or his wife were present for
the divorce under a special law for foreigners in the Dominican
Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti.
   The lawyers said the couple will continue to live in France.
   Duvalier's wife and her father, businessmen Ernest Bennett, were
resented by many Haitians who felt they lived in luxury while most
islanders suffered. When the Duvaliers fled the country Feb. 6,
1986, mobs ransacked Bennett's auto dealership and his related
businesses.
   After leaving Haiti, the ex-dictator and his wife retreated to
Mougins, southern France, where he lives in opulence in Villa
Mohamedia, rented from the Saudi magnate Adnan Kashoggi.
   The Duvaliers ruled Haiti for 29 years by force and with the
help of the dreaded secret police force, the Tonton Macoutes.
``Baby Doc'' succeeded his father on his death in 1971.

<HEAD>City to Seek Contempt Citations Against Black Protesters</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   City officials said Monday they will ask a
judge to have black protesters jailed and declared in contempt of
court unless the demonstrators call off a monthlong sit-in at City
Hall.
   Mayor Joe Smitherman said city attorneys will ask Circuit Judge
Leslie Johnson at a Friday hearing to have the leaders arrested and
fined unless a handful of people end their around-the-clock protest
before then.
   Smitherman called the demonstrators ``misfits, people on
welfare, people released from mental institutions.''
   As he spoke in his office, four protesters sat in chairs or on
the floor of the City Hall. Others were camped outside in two tents
on the lawn.
   ``It would be useless to fine these people out here _ they
haven't got anything,'' said the mayor.
   He said the city will seek contempt citations against leaders of
protests that began in January over the dismissal of Selma's first
black school superintendent. He mentioned among others, County
Commissioner Perry Varner and two lawyers, Hank Sanders and his
wife, Rose.
   Varner could not be located for comment, and neither Hank nor
Rose Sanders immediately returned telephone calls.
   Johnson signed an order Saturday limiting the City Hall protests
to business hours, although some protesters have continued to stay
the night. He also said they could not interfere with government
operations or City Council meetings.
   Several demonstrators said they were undeterred by Smitherman's
threat of jail, a possibility the mayor himself said he dreads for
fear of rekindling the flames of protest.
   Blacks have staged the protests and disrupted recent council
meetings to protest the white-controlled school board's decision
against renewing the contract of Superintendent Norward Roussell
when it expires June 30.
   Roussell and his supporters blame his dismissal on racism. But
the school board, which is appointed by the majority-white City
Council, cited Roussell's management style.
   The controversy also has included boycotts by teachers. Selma's
public schools were closed for nearly a week for fear of violence.

<HEAD>Barve Clings to Narrow Lead as Teams Begin Run Along Bering Sea
Coast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SHAKTOOLIK, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lavon Barve clung to the lead Monday
as front-runners in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race began their
run up the Bering Sea coast to Nome.
   Barve of Wasilla arrived at 4:02 p.m. in this windswept coastal
community, the final checkpoint before mushers head across the
treacherous ice of Norton Bay.
   ``Once they get onto the ice, they can expect sudden storms and
an ample supply of wind,'' said Gail Somerville, an Iditarod
spokeswoman in Anchorage.
   Three-time winner Susan Butcher of Manley and defending champion
Joe Runyan of Nenana were trailing Barve by just a couple of hours,
Somerville said.
   ``They haven't checked in yet, but they're not too far behind,''
she said.
   Tim Osmar of Clam Gulch, Dee Dee Jonrowe of Willow and Rick
Swenson of Two Rivers, the Iditarod's only four-time champion, had
reached Unalakleet, the largest community on the trail between
Eagle River and Nome.
   Barve, driving 14 dogs, was first out of Unakleet at 10:05 a.m.
But 50 miles earlier, at Kaltag, he rested his team only 3{ hours,
compared with eight hours for Butcher and five hours for Runyan.
   He didn't seem to think that was much of a handicap, however.
   ``My dogs are getting stronger with less rest,'' Barve said. ``I
think that's my advantage. My dogs always seem to recover fast.''
   Butcher, whose team had dropped to 12 dogs, said she would like
to be in front by the time the leaders reach White Mountain, just
77 miles from the finish of the 1,158-mile race.
   ``Unfortunately, that's not up to me as much as the other
guys,'' Butcher said. ``I'd like to shed them early but I don't
know if that's possible.
   ``And probably from what I know of Lavon's competitive spirit
and how he can do what he wants to do with that team, I may not
shed them at all.''
   Runyan said any one of the first five mushers could win the race
in the last 170-mile sprint to Nome.
   ``If you want to make a good bet, never bet on a dog race,'' he
said. ``It's really shaken out to which team is healthy and really
fit. Looks to me like it's anybody's bet what's going on here.''
   Before leaving Kaltag, Runyan said the leaders in the 18th
running of Iditarod had come under the spell of what he called the
``crazy syndrome.''
   ``Everybody's pushing, pushing, pushing,'' he said.
   Since 70 teams left Anchorage on March 3, seven mushers have
scratched and another has been disqualified because of sick dogs.
   The Iditarod, named for an abandoned gold-mining town along the
trail, was started in 1973 to commemorate the 1925 emergency
delivery of life-saving diphtheria serum from Anchorage to Nome by
sled dog teams.

<HEAD>Soviet Role Unresolved in European Bank; New Countries Join</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK McDOWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union's role in a new international
development bank for Eastern Europe proved the major sticking point
Sunday when officials from 39 countries failed to reach agreement
on terms for the institution.
   The weekend meeting also broke up without a compromise on what
currency will be used for the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, where it will be located or how shareholdings will be
balanced against voting rights.
   ``The most difficult question is the eligibility of one country
in particular,'' said Jacques Attali, an aide to French President
Francois Mitterrand, who proposed the bank in October.
   It was a reference to the Soviet Union, whose full participation
in the bank has been opposed by the United States.
   Attali, who presided over the talks, affirmed that the Soviet
Union's presence at the discussions meant it would have some future
role. He said the application of any country wishing to join would
be considered.
   Israel, Egypt, Morocco, South Korea and Lichtenstein took part
in the talks for the first time, adding to the original 34 Western
and Eastern European countries and the United States and Japan.
   ``We have opened up the teller's window,'' Attali said. ``The
more countries that wish to support the revolutions in central and
Eastern Europe, the better.''
   At the first session in January, held to set terms for the bank,
the United States ruled out Soviet participation unless Moscow made
the ruble a convertible currency and began other market reforms.
   The United States also says the Soviet Union hasn't gone as far
toward democracy as other East European countries, notably Poland,
Hungary and Czechoslovakia. The bank would also benefit Yugoslavia,
East Germany, Romania and Bulgaria.
   ``The U.S. is not isolated by any means at all,'' Attali said,
indicating other nations also object to full Soviet participation.
   Attali refused to comment directly on a compromise offered by
France. It would allow the Soviets to join the bank as a 6 percent
shareholder and limit them to 6 percent of total lending.
   The issued could be resolved before the next meeting, which is
set for April 9. Attali said negotiators were ``at the point of
consensus'' and believed the last obstacles would soon be overcome.
   The participants did agree that the 12-nation European Community
would provide 51 percent of the bank capital of about $12 billion,
Attali said.
   Negotiators have also found common ground on how loans will be
distributed between the private and public sectors, Attali said.
But he refused to reveal the formula.
   Japan, Britain and the United States had insisted loans be
restricted to private sector investment. Some other countries
proposed allowing 40 percent be made available for public projects
like roads and telephone networks.
   Attali predicted final terms could be set in April or May, with
the bank making loans by the end of the year or in early 1991.

   Lavon Barve was first out of this Yukon
River checkpoint Sunday, taking the lead in the Iditarod Trail Sled
Dog Race away from three-time winner Susan Butcher and heading
overland to Norton Sound.
   Barve of Wasilla left Kaltag at 2:28 p.m. even though Butcher
had beaten him to the checkpoint by almost an hour in the latest
stage of the 1,158-mile marathon race from Anchorage to Nome.
   The two leaders were followed into Kaltag by four-time Iditarod
winner Rick Swenson at 1:26 p.m. and 1989 champion Joe Runyan at
1:33 p.m. Dee Dee Jonrowe and Tim Osmar of were next in just before
2:30 p.m.
   Robin Jaconson of arrived at 4:15 p.m..
   By late afternoon, Barve was the only musher to have left
Kaltag. Swenson said he would take an eight hour rest here.
   Butcher, who started the race with 17 dogs, had 12 Sunday. Race
officials said some were dropped at checkpoints along the trail due
to illness.
   When she became the first musher to reach Ruby Saturday, Butcher
was rewarded with a luxurious meal of shrimp, veal, chocolate
cheesecake and other delights, as well as $2,500. She said then
that she intended to maintain the lead all the way to Nome.
   Kaltag is 42 miles along the Yukon, the biggest river in Alaska,
from the last checkpoint at Nulato, which Butcher left earlier
Sunday as leader. From Kaltag, where it heads overland to Unakleet
on Norton Sound. With 850 people, Unakleet is the bigest community
on the trail outside of Nome and Anchorage.
   Named for an abandoned gold-mining town along one branch of the
trail, the Iditarod race was started in 1973 to commemorate the
1925 emergency delivery of life-saving diphtheria serum from
Anchorage to Nome by relay dog sled teams.
   Joe Redington, the 73-year-old man considered the father of the
Iditarod, was last reported in 32nd place after pulling out of
Cripple, 510 miles from the starting line.

<HEAD>Papers Need To Provide More Services, Executive Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WICHITA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newspapers need to offer more services to
compete for readers who move from town to town without developing
ties to their communities, the chairman of the Knight-Ridder
newspaper group said March 7.
   ``Transiency is bad for the country and it's also terrible for
newspapers,'' said James Batten, who also serves as Knight-Ridder's
chief executive officer.
   Batten was executive in residence for Wichita State University's
Center for Entrepreneurship.
   He said one of the biggest challenges that newspapers must
confront is that readers have _ or think they have _ less time to
read than in the past.
   ``People are feeling the stress of time poverty _ it's tough to
wedge in everything we may want to do,'' he said.
   Adults who say they read a newspaper every day dropped from 73
percent in 1967 to 51 percent last year, Batten said.

<HEAD>Dallas Editor Contrasts U.S., Eastern Europe Attitudes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Americans are becoming more apathetic
about their communities and their governments while people in
Eastern Europe are struggling to attain many of the freedoms we
take for granted, an executive of a Dallas newspaper said March 5.
   ``We have a chance, if we don't blow it, to help reinvent
freedom,'' Burl Osborne, president and editor of The Dallas Morning
News, told a group at Kentucky Wesleyan College.
   ``We have great power to persuade; we can set the public
agenda,'' said Osborne.
   In South Africa, where Nelson Mandela now walks free, ``the wall
of apartheid has begun to crumble,'' he said. ``We need to rekindle
the passion for our own freedoms, in ourselves, in our newspapers
and in our communities.''
   For example, newspapers should tell readers how to get involved
in their community, Osborne said. Newspapers also must tell readers
how problems around the world can affect them locally.
   ``We need to do a better job than we've done explaining that
acid rain over Canada means something in Kentucky,'' he said.

<HEAD>China Denies Harassment of Journalists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government of China denounced a U.S. Embassy
investigation into the treatment of American journalists, denying
charges that its security forces have stepped up surveillance of
foreign reporters.
   Correspondents from nearly a dozen foreign news organizations
say they have been followed or their Chinese sources harassed by
plainclothes police in recent weeks.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing said March 8 that such
reports were groundless and that reporters who carry out normal and
legitimate news coverage ``need not worry that they might run into
troubles.''
   An investigation into the claims ordered by the State Department
was an interference in China's internal affairs, Li said.
   ``Should an investigation be really necessary, the
justice-upholding people in the world would have every reason to
ask, how many things has this superpower done in broad daylight
over the years to trample upon the sovereignty and infringe upon
the human rights of other nations?''
   The surveillance of foreign reporters appeared to step up after
martial law was lifted in Beijing on Jan. 11, with some journalists
saying they have been tailed even while jogging or shopping.
   Journalists say Chinese security agents have also tried to
photograph their meetings with Chinese sources and have
interrogated their Chinese contacts.

<HEAD>Post-Dispatch Offers New Contract to Employees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The St. Louis Post-Dispatch submitted a new
contract to negotiators representing about 630 newsroom employees
who have been on a ``byline strike.''
   Publisher Nicholas G. Penniman IV said March 9 that the latest
proposal was a response to concerns among employees. Most of the
newspaper's reporters and columnists have withheld their bylines
from stories since March 7.
   ``They said, `Tell us what you need to remain competitive and
give us a chance to vote,''' Penniman said.
   Herb Goodrick, executive secretary of The Newspaper Guild Local
47, said he would withhold comment until The Guild received a
written version.
   About 630 newsroom employees, including reporters, some editors,
photographers and advertising sales staffers, have been working
without a contract since the last one expired Feb. 28. The Guild is
the largest of 11 unions at the newspaper and one of six seeking a
new contract.
   Penniman said the new proposal was for three years and included
a 4 percent pay raise for each year and a $600 signing bonus. It
also eliminated many demands that Guild members had objected to in
the past few months.
   The Post-Dispatch is owned by Pulitzer Publishing Co.

<HEAD>News Sues Guild Over Arbitration of Contract Deadline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Daily News, negotiating a new contract with
the Newspaper Guild of New York and 10 other unions, filed a
federal lawsuit March 7 to block an effort to extend the contract
past an end-of-the-month deadline.
   The lawsuit, which named the Guild and its president, Barry
Lipton, seeks an injunction barring the union from continuing to
seek arbitration of the dispute over when the contract should
expire.
   The lawsuit is based on correspondence between Lipton and Edward
W. Gold, director of labor relations for the News.
   The exchange started with a letter from Lipton to Gold saying
the Guild wanted to terminate its contract. Such a letter is the
traditional signal opening a round of contract talks between unions
and newspapers.
   Gold confirmed the notice of termination and said the newspaper
was ready to start collective bargaining for a new contract. Gold
also had said that if a new contract was not negotiated by March
30, the expiration date of the current agreement, that contract
would not be renewed.
   The lawsuit said Lipton then asked to retract the Guild's letter
requesting termination of the contract and said the union expected
the terms of the old contract to continue if no agreement was
reached before March 30.
   On Feb. 15, the Guild sent letters to the News and the American
Arbitration Association asking for arbitration of the dispute, the
lawsuit said.
   The union says it has 799 members at the News.

<HEAD>New Journal of No-Apologies Liberalism to Be Launched</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Prospect, a quarterly journal
launched March 11 by a group of writers and academics, ``marks the
rebirth of no-apologies liberalism,'' its founders say.
   ``We're not neo-liberals, or post-liberals or any other hybrid.
We're liberals,'' said co-editor Robert Kuttner.
   The entry of the journal coincides with the exit of the Cold War
and its attending fixation on military issues, the editors said.
   ``A lot of the antagonisms that arose in the 1960s have died
out,'' said Paul Starr, a Princeton University sociologist and one
of the magazine's two editors. ``We think America's challenges
today are mainly social and economic.''
   The first issue, priced at $7.95, contains several meditations
on the role of liberalism in the 1990s, a feature article on ``The
Real Welfare Problem'' and a pollster's blueprint on how the
Democratic Party can reclaim middle-class votes without moving to
the right of the political spectrum.
   The journal's board of sponsors includes economist John Kenneth
Galbraith, historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. and Marian Wright
Edelman, founder of the Children's Defense fund.

<HEAD>Ad-Free Ms. Magazine Plans Return _ If Enough Subscribers Sign Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The owners of Ms. say the magazine will return
in June _ without ads _ if enough readers can be found willing to
buy yearly subscriptions that cost $40 for six issues.
   The magazine served for more than 17 years as the chronicler of
the feminist movement before suspending publication last December.
   Its new owner, publishing entrepreneur Dale Lang, said Ms. was
losing about $150,000 a month when he acquired it in mid-October.
The magazine had appeared 10 times a year for $16.
   Lang has said publishing the magazine without ads would enable
its editorial staff to concentrate on pursuing issues important to
women without concerns about advertiser backlash, which was said to
be a recurring problem.
   The new Ms. will be a 100-page magazine with investigative
reporting, profiles, interviews, fiction, poetry, regular features
on health and the environment and photgraphy from all over the
world.

<HEAD>Public Has Heard Enough of Trump Tale, Poll Shows</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Donald and Ivana saga may stir the hearts
of reporters and editors, but most Americans have heard enough of
the Trumps, according to a nationwide survey of news interests
released March 8.
   The monthly Times Mirror News Interest Index showed a record 55
percent of the 1,226 people surveyed thought there was too much
news about the Trumps' domestic battle. It was by far the largest
``over-covered'' rating ever accorded a story since the poll was
begun in 1986.
   The survey, conducted by the Gallup Organization, found no
single news story dominated public attention in the last month. The
freeing of black South African leader Nelson Mandela and political
changes in the Soviet Union led the index, with ``very closely
followed'' ratings of 30 percent and 28 percent, respectively.
   The index is sponsored by the Times Mirror Center for The People
&amp; The Press. Based on the total sample of 1,226 adults, the poll
has a 95 percent chance of being within 3 percentage points of the
results that would be obtained if the entire adult population were
interviewed.

<HEAD>News Photographer Innocent in Abortion Protest Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A news photographer arrested while covering
an anti-abortion protest was found innocent March 7 of a charge
that he failed to obey a police order to move away as officers
carried a demonstrator to the paddy wagon.
   County Judge Wilford Flowers handed down the innocent verdict
for freelance photographer Gary Kanadjian, who was on assignment
for The Associated Press during the December 1988 protest by
Operation Rescue at the Ladies Center in Austin.
   Defense attorney Hugh Lowe said Kanadjian was serving the public
in covering a news event that involved ``the most emotional public
debate today _ abortion.''
   Lowe said police had mistreated some of the protesters and

   Journalists, relatives and government leaders
appealed to Iraq on March 11 to grant clemency to a London-based
journalist sentenced to death on espionage charges and to a British
woman accused of helping him.
   A delegation of European Economic Community ambassadors went to
the Foreign Ministry in Baghdad to make a ``humanitarian appeal''
on behalf of Farzad Bazoft and Daphne Parish.
   British Ambassador Harold Walker said he made a separate trip to
the ministry t deliver a personal appeal from Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   Bazoft, 31, was arrested in September and charged with spying
for foreign powers after making an unauthorized trip to a military
complex where a huge explosion had been reported. He was in Iraq on
an assignment for The Observer, a London newspaper.
   Mrs. Parish, 52, a senior nursing administrator for an Irish-run
hospital in Baghdad, was accused of helping Bazoft by driving him
to the Al-Iskandaria military complex south of Baghdad. She was
sentenced to 15 years in prison.
   No date has been set for the execution. Under Iraqi law, no
court appeal is allowed against the sentences. They were imposed by
a revolutionary court Saturday after a closed trial.
   Bazoft is an Iranian exile who has lived in Britain since 1975
and travels on British documents.

Boccardi; NBC News anchorman Tom Brokaw; CBS News anchorman Dan
Rather, and broadcast personality Larry King.
   Other commemorations:
   _In Nicosia, Cyprus, the AP's Mideast hub, the
multidenominational Nicosia Community Church will conduct a
40-minute prayer service.
   _In upstate New York, where Anderson spent his boyhood,
supporters will begin a 24-hour fast at a service in Buffalo on

   The association, which includes 1,400 newspapers, magazines and

Feb. 25.
   Mrs. Chamorro pledged total press freedom. On March 7 the

<HEAD>Death Row Newspaper Endorses Candidate for Texas Governor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ann Richards got an endorsement for her
Democratic campaign for governor she didn't expect or necessarily
want, from editors of a Texas death row newspaper.
   James Beathard, an assistant editor of Endeavor newspaper, said
inmate support likely would hurt Ms. Richards rather than help her
in the election.
   ``But it's us they're trying to kill, and we should have a right
to comment about the people who are trying to kill us,'' said
Beathard, awaiting death for a 1984 spree in which three people
were slain.
   Ms. Richards' two Democratic opponents, Attorney General Jim
Mattox and former Gov. Mark White, have run television ads in which
they take credit for making Texas the nation's leader in
executions. Since Texas resumed the death penalty in 1982, 33 men
have been given lethal injections.
   Endeavor editors and other inmates were particularly upset with
a White commercial in which large pictures of the executed
prisoners are used as props.
   Beathard said Ms. Richards appeared to be concentrating on such
issues as education, minorities and the budget.
   When she first heard of the endorsement Ms. Richards thought the
question was a joke.
   ``I don't know what possibly could have engendered it,'' she
said while campaigning for the March 13 primary. `I don't know
anybody on death row.'' Ms. Richards said she believes the death
penalty law should be followed.
   The newspaper, in existence for nearly a year, is believed to be
the only one of its kind among the nation's death rows.

<HEAD>Court Rules Against Houston Chronicle in Open Records Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals on March 7
rejected the Houston Chronicle's effort to overturn a state judge's
order the newspaper said violates the First Amendment by denying it
access to criminal court files.
   In September, State District Judge Charles Hearn ordered Harris
County District Clerk Ray Hardy to refuse public access to the
addresses and telephone numbers of defendants in criminal court
files, until the defendants retained a lawyer or had one appointed
to represent them.
   The action was taken to stop defense lawyers from soliciting
potential clients, according to court records.
   But Hardy said he does not have the manpower to examine the
approximately 100 criminal files he receives each day and edit out
addresses and telephone numbers, according to a brief filed by the
newspaper. The clerk then decided to withhold entire files, the
newspaper said.
   ``The files in the criminal intake division ... constitute a
unique and irreplaceable newsgathering resource for members of the
media,'' the brief said. It also said denying names and telephone
numbers to the press interferes with reporters' responsibility to
check information for accuracy.
   The court, without writing an opinion, denied the newspaper's
motion. It earlier denied a motion by Hardy seeking to set aside
the judge's ruling as being in conflict with the Texas Open Records
Act.

<HEAD>UPI Seeks Arbitration of Photo Dispute With Reuters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reuters filed court papers March 9 opposing
United Press International's request for a preliminary injunction
barring Reuters from backing out of a picture exchange agreement.
   UPI claims Reuters has deprived it of photo revenue for the past
five years and is seeking damages of more than $600,000.
   Under an arrangement that began in 1985 and which was supposed
to run for 10 years, UPI provided Reuters with pictures from the
United States while Reuters supplied pictures from other countries.
   Reuters, which claims UPI's photo report has declined since the
exchange began, has filed suit in federal court seeking to void the
contract between the two news services.
   In the memorandum of March 9, made in response to a counterclaim
made by UPI, Reuters denied allegations that it ``poached'' certain
UPI clients, taken away employees and was trying to drive UPI out
of business.
   ``It is a collection of inflammatory statements based on no
authority whatever or on serious distortions of the documents at
issue,'' Reuters said.
   UPI has filed a request for arbitration in the case, saying
Reuters is obligated under agreements between the two companies to
reimburse UPI for any revenue lost as a result of subscribers
shifting to Reuters' photo service.
   Reuters spokesman Robert Crooke said there is no evidence UPI
lost money because of his company's marketing activities.
   ``We welcome the opportunity that the arbitration provides to
establish not only that Reuter activities are not the cause of
UPI's losses but that those causes lie much closer to UPI's own
actions,'' Crooke said.
   U.S. District Judge Peter K. Leisure earlier issued a temporary
restraining order against Reuters, which remains in effect until he
decides whether to issue the injunction.
   Reuters said Feb. 16 it was canceling the agreement and halted
its flow of pictures to UPI for more than four hours.
   Reuters has alleged that UPI's photo service has declined since
the exchange began.

disappearance of Michael Rosenblum of Pittsburgh in 1980.
   The lawsuit claimed that portions of the article falsely
suggested the officers were somehow responsible for Rosenblum's
disappearance. The suit also said writer James T. Harger made
defamatory comments about the two officers during an interview with
a radio station and to two Allegheny County detectives.
   Another suit against the magazine, its editor and Harger is

Pantheon's established role as a publishing house for

   The state Department of Revenue cannot
collect sales taxes on magazine subscriptions sold in Tennessee,
the state Supreme Court ruled March 5.
   The unanimous decision held that magazines cannot be singled out
for taxation while newspapers are not.
   The ruling means the state Department of Revenue will have to
refund sales taxes paid by Newsweek magazine, whose lawsuit

Revenue Commissioner Joe Huddleston said.
   ``We have not previously taxed newspapers, and the thrust of the
decision is to tell us that we cannot tax magazines and exempt
newspapers,'' Huddleston said.

paid by magazines.
   Newsweek challenged the sales tax and penalties it had paid on
subscription sales in Tennessee between Jan. 1, 1982, and Dec. 31,

   The National Football League wrapped up its new
television package March 9 by agreeing to a deal with NBC that
boosts its total TV revenue to more than $3.6 billion over four
years, an all-sports record.
   The new agreement, for $752 million over four years, concludes
two months of negotiations that will increase the amount of TV
revenues each team now gets to $32 million from $17 million.
   It also will increase the number of playoff teams from 10 to 12
and eventually increase the length of the season from 16 to 18
weeks.
   The total NFL package is almost double what the league obtained
in its last contract, when it got $1.428 billion over three years.
   The negotiators increased the season to 17 weeks for the next
two years and 18 weeks thereafter, although teams will continue to
play a 16-game schedule. They added a Sunday night cable package
for the first half of season, which was sold to Turner
Broadcasting, and finally added two more playoff teams, sweetening
the ABC pot by giving the network its first playoff games ever.
   The revenue does not include the 1994 Super Bowl, which is

   Students across the country got the news
March 5 along with a sales pitch for candy, razors and cheese
snacks when the advertiser-supported classroom program Channel One
went on the air.
   The news show, beamed nationwide for the first time to 400
schools, is produced by Knoxville-based Whittle Communications,
which loans participating schools expensive video equipment and
satellite dishes to receive the program, and sells advertising to
cover the cost.
   Despite criticism from national education groups, bans by public
educators in New York and California and a lawsuit in North
Carolina, 2,900 schools in 34 states have signed up for Channel
One, company Chairman Christopher Whittle told reporters at the
high school. He predicted 8,000 would be committed by December.
   ``I predict that within five years a system like this will be in
95 percent of all middle and high schools in the United States. In
a sense, it will be a new institution in America's schools.''
   But Timothy Dyer, executive director of the National Association
of Secondary School Principals, worried that Channel One, which
already has been tested in a number of schools, marked the
beginning of ``the commercialization of the classroom.''
   The program, produced in New York and sent by satellite to
participating schools, included feature stories on a Japanese high
school in Tennessee and an Army recruiting office in Kentucky.
   The 12-minute program was interspersed with two minutes of
30-second commercials for M&amp;Ms, Gillette shavers and Chee-tos. The

   A former gynecologist accused of performing
genital surgery on women without their knowledge to enhance their
sexual responsiveness is suing CBS for $250 million over a ``West
57th Street'' broadcast.
   In the lawsuit, filed March 5 in federal court, James C. Burt
alleged he was defamed by the program. CBS spokesman Tom Goodman
said, ``We believe the report was entirely fair and accurate, and
CBS News stands by it.''
   Burt, 68, faces about 50 malpractice suits for his
self-described ``love surgery,'' in which he altered the genitals
of his patients, allegedly without informing them of the true
purpose of the procedure. Burt, who said the surgery was designed
to enhance their responsiveness, contended he has ``never operated
on anybody without informed consent.''
   Burt sued over a 1988 broadcast of the news show, which is no
longer on the air, that contained interviews with several former
patients.
   The ``ludicrous and horrendous'' report ``started a chain
reaction of talk shows, magazine articles, media reports that have
since totally destroyed my personal life, my profession as
physician, loss of property, loss of income, my family,'' Burt said
in a statement.
   Also named as defendants were two past or present CBS employees,
a patient and another doctor.
   In 1989, Burt surrendered his medical license just days before a

12 with music, jokes, stories, sing-alongs and the news.
   Orlando station WPRD-AM, which now airs big-band music, will
switch to a round-the-clock format for children at the end of this
month, becoming the flagship station for the Kids' Choice
Broadcasting Network.
   Investors are seeking to raise $3 million to $4 million to
launch the 24-hour network and hope to have 100 subscriber stations
in the nation's top 20 markets by next year.
   The format, with a staff of 10, is based on children's
programming at KPAL in Little Rock, Ark., which was on the air from
1985 to 1988 and won a number of national awards.

<HEAD>FCC Is Asked To Block Sale of WWL-TV</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   United Communications Inc., a minority-owned
investment group, has asked the Federal Communications Commission
to reject the $102.85 million sale of WWL-TV.
   The legal challenge filed in Washington, D.C., is aimed at
blocking the effort of WWL-TV manager Mike Early and his Rampart
Operating Partnership, made up of WWL-TV employees, to buy the
station from Loyola University. The school agreed Dec. 21 to sell
WWL to the group.
   United Communications' petition contends that senior WWL
employees broke antitrust laws and frustrated United's efforts by
threatening to resign, reducing the station's value, if Loyola sold
to anyone but Early.
   Early had no immediate comment, saying he had just received a
copy of the petition and was going over it.
   Loyola Vice President John Eckholdt said through a spokesman
that ``after a preliminary review of the challenge, it has no basis

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ In a climate of lawlessness and

   At least 24 people had been killed in the seven days of protests

or police.

<HEAD>A Kiss Brings Matt Dillon of `Gunsmoke' Back to Old Love</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In 20 years of ``Gunsmoke,'' Marshal Matt
Dillon had just one on-screen kiss, the woman wasn't Miss Kitty,
and television left a lot to viewers' imaginations.
   Now the full story can be told.
   ``Gunsmoke II: The Last Apache,'' a CBS movie airing Sunday,
brings back James Arness as Dillon, trying to rescue his daughter,
Beth _ a child the television audience, and the marshal, didn't
know existed.
   If Dillon wants to see his daughter, he has to rescue her from
an Indian warrior who has claimed her for his bride.
   The Dodge City marshal got his kiss Sept. 24, 1973, in an
episode called ``Matt's Love Story,'' one of the highest-rated of
the 500 ``Gunsmoke'' episodes.
   Instead of the ever-present and available Kitty, the owner of
the Long Branch Saloon played by the late Amanda Blake, the
recipient of the kiss was Michael Learned. In the movie, she
reprises her role as a self-reliant widow named Mike.
   ``She's the only woman Matt ever kissed on screen,'' said
Arness, acknowledging the implicit off-screen romance between Matt
and Kitty. ``The movie has a flashback to that earlier show. Matt
had amnesia and was recovering from a wound. They wind up having a
brief affair. When he regains his memory, he returns to Dodge.''
   Learned, the Emmy-winning actress who played Olivia on ``The
Waltons,'' returned to ``Gunsmoke'' later in 1973 as a ``lady of
questionable occupation.''
   That same season, Kitty had her own kisses in an episode called
``Kitty's Love Affair.'' Her lover was a former gunfighter played
by Richard Kiley. Matt and Kitty set off for a weekend in St.
Louis, but Matt is suddenly called back to Dodge City. Kitty,
angered that Matt is leaving, continues on alone and meets Kiley.
   Sunday's two-hour movie also stars Kiley as an Army scout named
Chalk Brighton, who's in love with Mike; Amy Stock-Poynton as Matt
and Mike's daughter; Joe Lara as Wolf, the Apache warrior; and Hugh
O'Brian as an Army general.
   Earl W. Wallace wrote the screenplay, Charles Correll directed
and John Mantley, producer for the series' last 11 years, was the
executive producer. Mantley also produced Arness' second series,
``How The West Was Won.'' Wallace, who shared an Oscar for the
theatrical movie ``Witness,'' wrote regularly for both TV series.
   ``Gunsmoke II'' was filmed on location in southwest Texas near
Del Rio and in Big Bend National Park.
   ``It opens with Matt traveling somewhere in the Far West,''
Arness said. ``He gets a letter from Mike asking him to come to her
ranch. When he gets there, he finds out about his daughter. She's
just been taken captive by the Apaches and it's up to Matt to get
her back with the help of Chalk and Mike.''
   ``Gunsmoke,'' on the air from 1955-75, was the longest-running
dramatic show in television history. It made its debut on CBS Radio
in 1952 with William Conrad as Matt Dillon.
   Dennis Weaver starred in the early years as Matt's deputy, and
Burt Reynolds was a regular from 1962-65. Besides Arness, the late
Milburn Stone, who played Doc Adams, was the only actor to stay
with the show the entire run.
   Although ``Gunsmoke'' had a regular cast, as well as a large
number of recurring performers who played townspeople, it basically
was an anthology.
   Over the years, guest stars included Richard Dreyfuss, Bette
Davis, Jean Arthur, Ellen Burstyn, Jon Voight, Nick Nolte, Loretta
Swit and Mariette Hartley.
   The first movie, 1987's ``Gunsmoke: Return To Dodge,'' also
starred Amanda Blake. Like ``Gunsmoke II,'' that movie picked up on
an earlier story from the series.
   ``I don't know if we'll do another,'' said Arness, a robust 66
years old. ``We'll wait and see what the reaction to this one is.''
   After ``Gunsmoke,'' Arness starred for several years in ``How
The West Was Won'' and in a short-lived detective series called
``McClain's Law.'' Since then, he's also done a remake of ``Red
River'' and ``Alamo: 13 Days to Glory.''
   ``I've seen some of the westerns on television, but not to
follow them,'' Arness said. ``I did think `Lonesome Dove' was
excellent.''
   Would he do another series? ``Not if I had my druthers,'' he
said. ``It's a tremendous workload. It takes a couple of years to
just get organized. I wouldn't do it by choice. Doing a movie every
year or two is fine with me.''

      Today's highlight in history:
   One year ago, in the early morning hours of March 24, 1989, the
nation's worst oil spill occurred as the supertanker Exxon Valdez
ran aground on a reef in Alaska's Prince William Sound and began
leaking 11 million gallons of crude.
   
   On this date:
   In 1765, Britain enacted the Quartering Act, requiring American
colonists to provide temporary housing to British soldiers.
   In 1882, German scientist Robert Koch announced in Berlin that
he had discovered the bacillus responsible for tuberculosis.
   In 1883, long-distance telephone service was inaugurated between
Chicago and New York.
   In 1932, a New York radio station (WABC) broadcast a variety
program from a moving train in Maryland.
   In 1934, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed a bill granting
future independence to the Philippines.
   In 1944, in occupied Rome, the Nazis executed more than 300
civilians in reprisal for an attack by Italian partisans the day
before that killed 32 German soldiers.

<HEAD>Bush Pledge: At Least No New FEDERAL Taxes</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Short of funds but not proposals, the
administration is cranking out goals, guidelines, initiatives and
objectives at an unmatched rate. All are tailored to fit President
Bush's pledge: no new taxes.
   At least no new federal taxes.
   The latest catalogue of administration aims was the new
transportation policy proposed last week, featuring 169 guidelines
and 65 legislative objectives, by Transportation Department count.
``It's time to act,'' President Bush said, ``and it's time to give
our state and local governments the flexibility that they need to
best use federal funds.''
   The amount of federal money they get to use flexibly is another
matter; Democratic governors like New York's Mario Cuomo said state
and local governments have been paying a steadily increasing share
of transportation costs for the past 10 years.
   Secretary of Transportation Samuel K. Skinner said the states
want more authority and responsibility over the use of
transportation funds, and should have it. ``But we're also going to
ask them to come up with a greater share,'' he said.
   The transportation blueprint, and the instant dispute about
financing highways, airport and mass transit systems, produced a
replay of the debate over education reform measures.
   Last month, the administration embraced an education reform plan
based on six goals and 21 more specific objectives, drafted by
governors after Bush's 1989 education summit.
   Democrats complained that the administration wasn't proposing
enough federal school aid to back its endorsement of reform. House
Speaker Thomas D. Foley said the administration budget recommends a
2 percent increase in federal education spending, but the gap is
too big for that. ``We don't have a 2 percent problem,'' he said.
   In each case, the administration has set ambitious goals for
reform and improvement in a costly and vital facet of American
life, to put things right by the year 2000. In each, the cost has
been left to be filled in later, with resources to be found
elsewhere.
   Dealing with education, the administration maintains that more
money won't buy reform, that it is going to take changes in the way
children are taught and schools are operated.
   Bush said he would seek increased flexibility in the use of
federal aid, with increased accountability on the part of the
states.
   The same offer is built into the transportation policy.
   But there is a basic difference: Reform won't rebuild roads,
bridges or outdated airports. That takes money, and a lot of it.
Public and private estimates put the cost of rebuilding the
American infrastructure at well over $3 trillion. Furthermore, the
federal government historically has had a far greater role in
transportation than in education.
   The administration blueprint basically seeks to have state and
local governments, and the people and businesses using
transportation facilities, take increasing responsibility for the
cost of repairing them and running them.
   ``I think we feel that state and local governments have not
provided a sufficient amount of infrastructure funding,'' Skinner.
   In a variation on Ronald Reagan's old theory that Washington
should cut both spending and taxes and leave more of both to the
states, the administration argued that increases in federal
transportation levies would foreclose state decisions.
   ``And if the federal government were to raise the gas tax, it
would eliminate, or it would basically preempt state governments
from raising their gas tax,'' Skinner said.
   He said 33 states have increased their gasoline taxes or taken
other steps to create special funds for transportation facilities
in the past three years. Skinner said that shows the states are
willing to do it. But Democratic Gov. Wallace Wilkinson of
Kentucky, where the gasoline tax already has been increased a
nickel a gallon, said the states are running out of options. He
said it would be virtually impossible for him to ask for another
gas tax boost.
   The administration plan also says restrictions should be relaxed
so that state and local governments can raise transportation funds
in other ways, including the use of highway tolls and airport
passenger charges. It urges efforts to get private business and
investors involved in building and running transportation
facilities.
   Washington, the new policy says, is to concentrate on collecting
user fees ``as the key element in financing the federal share of
transportation expenditures.''
   That fits the no-new-tax game plan. Bush budget advisers said
from the beginning that user fees don't count as tax increases,
even though the people paying them may not always see the
difference.

   Ever wonder what goes on inside the heads of the
world's biggest business leaders?
   The March 26 issue of Fortune, featuring perspectives on the
'90s from 126 business luminaries, provides a rare glimpse.
   The twice-monthly magazine produced much more than just another
issue to celebrate its own 60th anniversary. It scoured the world
for deep thinkers, some big names and some not so well-known, to
serve up an outlook for the decade ahead.
   The result is a document that is exhilarating and troubling.
   Exhilarating because it gives voice _ all the views are aired
via the first person _ to a wonderfully optimistic view of the
future, one where the environment is protected, the customer is
served and executives hold fewer meetings.
   But troubling because it can leave you wondering why all this
visionary leadership from the executive suite hasn't yet been
translated into hard achievements _ especially in America, which by
some accounts has lost at least a step in the global business
footrace.
   Lee Iacocca, ever blunt, gets to the heart of the matter on the
second page of the Fortune presentation:
   ``We can't sit around and commiserate with one another _ we've
got to get good, we've got to compete, we've got to be world class.
We can't just shout it, we've got to be it.''
   Billionaire Ross Perot follows with a view of who is world class:
   ``When I go to Asia or Europe, I feel like I'm looking at
tomorrow. When I go to many U.S. cities, I see decay and neglect
and I feel like I'm looking at yesterday.''
   That's not to say America is losing its patented ingenuity.
Software genius Bill Gates, who at 34 may be the nation's youngest
billionaire, says he sees a future of ``information at your
fingertips'' that will give middle managers access to data now
reserved for chief executives.
   Arno Penzias of AT&amp;T Bell Labs, a leading research and
development group, takes the idea a step further, describing a
``multimedia'' terminal with a ``bunch of video windows'' that will
allow business people to talk with each other while they do their
desktop computing.
   But Gates adds the sobering view that a lot of ``plumbing''
needs to be done to put such a system in place.
   ``We need faster microprocessors, local area networks, graphic
commands for the user _ all these things we're working on,'' notes
Gates.
   What's unsettling is that others may be far ahead of us. Some of
the foreign leaders quoted by Fortune leave the impression they
could stock the shelves at any moment with the products we've all
been waiting for.
   Hiroyuki Mizuno, head of R&amp;D for Matsushita Electric Industrial
of Japan, talks of ``new intelligent tools in the home'' _ VCRs and
home appliances activated by voice commands, even over the phone.
   The kicker on his remarks suggests such machines aren't far off,
at least for the Japanese.
   ``All the big electronics companies are discussing how to do
this,'' he says at the end of his commentary.
   If the prospect of being overrun by the Japanese doesn't scare
you, the comments of some of Wall Street's finest may. Lewis
Ranieri, who helped create the mortgage-backed bond business that
blossomed in the era of leverage, believes the game of greed will
continue in the '90s.
   ``The hottest game in finance ... will be guys with cash buying
assets at a discount,'' he says.
   The worrisome undercurrent running through these comments is
that American leaders may have missed _ or ignored _ the real
lessons of the '80s. As John F. Welch Jr., chief executive of
General Electric, correctly notes, ``The pace of change in the '90s
will make the '80s look like a picnic.''
   Is the United States as ready as some other competitors to face
this future? Maybe not.
   ``The problem is that nobody is even asking the questions, much
less coming up with a coherent set of strategies to execute the
answers,'' computer wizard Steve Jobs told Fortune in what may be
the most pessimistic assessment in the magazine.
   ``Getting rid of General Noriega is important, but I wish the
computer industry would get a tenth of the space on our national
agenda that he has,'' says Jobs.
   You might want to put this particular issue of Fortune in a box
somewhere and pull it out again at the turn of the century, just to
see if Americans and their world business partners rallied the
necessary public and private sector support for turning their
dreams into reality.

   It all began on a Friday the 13th. Kay Bartlett
was about to accompany a friend who wanted to look at a black cat
she was thinking about adopting. Then came the fall, and now, more
than two years later, she still battles a very unfriendly
poltergeist that controls her life, Chronic Pain Syndrome.

   Two years and a couple of months ago, I lost
control of my life.
   Pain took over.
   Now it regulates nearly every moment of my waking life, holding
me captive to its savage dictates.
   Twice a night, too, it comes to visit, sometimes just to say
hello and remind me it is still round, other times to visit for a
long chat.
   Pain makes me irritable, it makes me cry. It sends me into fits
of rage and sloughs of despair.
   My pain stems from a neck injury suffered in a fall that
ironically was caused by a medication which dumped my blood
pressure and sent me into a semiconvulsion in my kitchen. I woke up
choking on my blood, not sure how long I had been unconscious,
whether it was all blood pressure or whether the bonks on Formica
contributed.
   The immediate damage was quickly assessed. I had knocked out my
two front teeth. Although my neck and shoulders ached, it seemed
like the kind of pain that I, as a weekend warrior athlete, would
normally get when I played tennis or softball.
   But these aches did not heal. They went from aching to the
feeling that a woodpecker was perched on my right shoulder
constantly pecking at a knot in the right side of my neck. Then the
pain started shooting up and down the spine. Then the muscle spasms
took over. One night I lost most of the power in my right side
temporarily. I started falling on the street, my right leg just
losing it.
   I have consulted more than a dozen physicians, mostly
specialists, as well as non-traditional healers, two
acupuncturists, one acupressurist, even a pain hypnotist. He
decreed I was among the 20 percent of the population that is not
hypnotizable.
   The consensus is I have crossed over into what they call
``Chronic Pain Syndrome.''
   I don't want to hear that.
   I want it fixed, dammit.
   If they can operate on fetal hearts, sew back fingers severed by
subway cars, perform open heart surgery as routinely as
appendectomies, why, oh why, can't they fix a neck that simply took
a heavy bang?
   Pain has changed my life, narrowing it as old age will
eventually do. But, at 49, I'm not old enough to be this old. I
feel like in the last two years I have aged 30.
   I no longer drive. It's too painful and potentially hazardous.
I've let my license expire.
   I've been to one Broadway show and one movie since the accident.
It is too painful to sit in a seat for two hours, especially at
night when I have been up part of the day. Ditto for museums, art
galleries, concerts and all the other reasons one chooses to live
in New York City.
   I cannot read for long periods at a time.
   Doing dishes is a killer, but a necessity. Ironing is out. I
don't wear anything that needs to be ironed.
   I rarely wear my contact lenses anymore. The neck movement to
put them in and take them out is a painful one.
   I've not bought any clothes since the Nov. 13, 1987, fall. It's
too painful to try them on.
   I tried shopping once, but the pain became overpowering and I
raced home, to a Manhattan apartment that has now become my
workplace most of the time. It seems silly. I live 20 blocks from
my office, but it costs too much in pain to go in to the office
every day. It is more productive and less painful, but lonely and
isolated, to work from home. With today's computer technology, it's
possible.
   It's the little things that defeat my spirit. Routine tasks have
become minefields waiting to explode the pain. Pulling on pantyhose
and boots? Could be the worst mistake of the day. Brushing my
teeth? It always hurts. Why washing my hair, under a hot shower,
hurts, is the biggest mystery. That should feel good, but it
doesn't.
   I see movies now on my VCR. I've also learned that people, even
close friends, just are incapable of understanding something as
foreign as this kind of captivity. They constantly ask if I've seen
the latest movie. Or, eagerly recommend one.
   I have explained for a million times that I don't go to movies.
They ask, incredulously, for the millionth time, how could sitting
in a movie bother me?
   What do you say? Nothing. Eventually, you don't explain.

   Yes, I could go to a movie if that was the only plan of the day.
It's just that too many other things take priority. Working, fixing
food, getting dressed, running errands, going to the supermarket,
writing checks, dumping garbage.
   Before the fall, I usually took care of household chores in a
white tornado fashion, food shopping, laundry and apartment
cleaning all in one day, usually finishing by 3 p.m.
   I usually went out four or five times a week, either to a play,
a movie, dinner at someone's home or a restaurant, nothing
dramatic. I frequently was a weekend guest at country homes of
friends. I sailed. I often walked two miles to work, through
Central Park.
   Now, I'm mostly an isolated homebody. I'm lucky I have a single
friend left. I have canceled more appointments than I've kept.
   My pain has caused me to budget my activities, the way a person
existing on a limited fixed income shops. My ``income'' is the
ability to stand or sit up straight, to do anything that requires
flexion, the ability to look down, to concentrate without the
overwhelming distraction of pain.
   In short, to function.
   I manage my pennies of energy carefully. Going out at night is a
lavish expenditure.
   New companions, in addition to the cervical collar, are the
moist heating pad; the old sock with three tennis balls inside, the
better to get the heat on the spot where the pain likes to sear;
jars and jars of Mineral Ice, a remedy that works something like
putting medication on a tooth that really needs dental attention.
Its help is short-lived, but I'll take it.
   I've learned a lot of tricks, some vetoed by the doctors. One is
to drive the back of my head into the living room carpet with all
my might. It seems to get something off of something. Trouble is
the sophisticated tests don't show anything on anything. I'm
betting on my body, not technology. The other is to hunker down,
put all my weight on the balls of my feet and stretch out the whole
spine. That helps, too. For no apparent medical reason.
   I have learned a lot about pain.
   One: It can drive you crazy, even in small amounts, by its
constancy.
   Two: It can drive you to question your sanity when it lifts.
When pain is gone, for some mysterious reason, so is the memory of
it. You immediately begin thinking you made it all up. Or, more
ominously, that it's not coming back. I still fall for that. I
guess it's a tribute to the elasticity of the human spirit. It's
also pretty stupid.
   Three: It's not nice to fool Mother Nature. Distraction therapy
works temporarily. While it may be good for the psyche, pain will
get the last laugh. You pay the piper if you push the body beyond
where it is ready to go. It is better to cooperate. When it says
this is going to be a bad day, believe it. Rest it. The next day
will be better.
   Four: Pain is tiring.
   Five: Pain is not one entity. It is an orchestra, sometimes
featuring a soloist, sometimes many instruments. My worst pain is
the searing pain right along the right side of the vertebrae. It
can be razor sharp with each step digging in.
   There is the shooting pain down my right arm, often causing
ersatz numbness in my fingers. It's not total numbness. It's more
like the sensation you have when the novocaine is wearing off. You
feel something, but not everything.
   There is the stab of the muscle spasms, the ache of soreness,
sometimes dull, sometimes acute, always persistent.
   Twice a week I go to physical therapy where I am tractioned,
ultrasounded, electronically stimulated. I spend a few minutes
every hour exercising. I am surely by now a contender for a mention
in the Guinness Book of World Records for the most shoulder rolls
completed.
   I will not share all the advice I've been given. You can imagine
it. One I must. A New Ager among my acquaintances told me this
unmitigating pain was a wonderful opportunity for spiritual growth.
Fortunately, she was on the other end of the telephone, out of
range of my rage.
   The one piece of advice I will never take is that I must quit
fighting, that I must accept the pain.
   I will never give up. I will get rid of it.

   The battle lines are drawn again at Antietam,
the scene of some of the bloodiest fighting of the Civil War, as
preservationists seek to protect the area from encroaching
development. This time neighbor is pitted against neighbor with the
National Park Service in the middle, a scenario that's also being
played out at other historic sites around the country.

   Once again, Millard Kefauver's 280-acre
dairy farm is in the line of fire.
   Kefauver's great-grandfather farmed the same land when Union and
Confederate soldiers surged across the rolling western Maryland
landscape on Sept. 17, 1862, in the bloodiest single day of
fighting of the Civil War.
   Now Kefauver and his family are swept up in a struggle over
efforts to protect the Antietam National Battlefield Park from
encroaching development.
   It is typical of many struggles being fought out as the great
cities of America extend their suburbs into the once-quiet
countryside.
   ``Battles were fought near areas that had strategic importance
then and, since they had strategic importance then, they would have
growth potential now,'' says Edwin Bearss, chief historian of the
National Park Service and a specialist on the Civil War.
   The National Trust for Historic Preservation says Cedar Creek
Battlefield and Belle Grove Plantation at Middletown, Va., where
Union General Phil Sheridan handed the Confederacy one of its final
stunning blows by winning control of the Shenandoah Valley in 1864,
could be surrounded by eight 10-acre industrial parks.
   In 1988, Congress authorized acquisition of Stuart's Hill at
Manassas, Va., stopping plans for a 1.2 million-square-foot
shopping mall on land where the Blue and the Gray fought two
crucial battles. Just last year, Congress stepped in again and
approved expansion of Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National
Military Park in Virginia.
   It is not just Civil War battlefields that are threatened,
preservationists say. The National Trust has a list of what it
calls the 11 most endangered historic places, including sites
associated with Columbus' landing in the Virgin Islands, the
rivalry of Spain and England for control of the Georgia and South
Carolina coasts early in the 18th century, and 19th century gold
and silver strikes in South Dakota.
   Preservationists are far from united on how to deal with the
situation.
   ``One view is that the only way to protect a park and the only
way to be truly fair to landowners is to have the federal
government purchase the property,'' says Bruce Craig of the
National Parks and Conservation Association.
   That approach got a boost as long ago as the 1890s, when
Congress established Gettysburg National Military Park in
Pennsylvania, blocking Gettysburg Electric Railway Co. from
building a development around Big Round Top, a vital point of
ground in the engagement that marked the high-water mark of
Confederate fortunes.
   The railroad sued, saying Congress didn't have the power to
acquire land for commemorative purposes. The Supreme Court, in a
unanimous opinion in 1896, replied, ``Such a use seems ... not only
a public use, but one so closely connected with the welfare of the
Republic itself as to be within the powers granted the Congress by
the Constitution for the purpose of protecting and preserving the
whole country.''
   The trouble is that protecting and preserving the whole country
can be costly.
   In the Manassas case, for example, the purchase price was left
to future negotiation, and hasn't been settled yet.
   ``What the lands will ultimately cost the taxpayer no one
knows,'' says Bearss, the Park Service historian.
   In addition, says Craig of the Parks and Conservation
Association, ``There is sometimes a community hesitation and a
suspicion of what the federal government is likely to do with that
property.''
   There sure is.
   ``I can never be satisfied with anything the Park Service
does,'' says Russell Weaver of Sharpsburg, president of Save
Historic Antietam with Responsible Policies (SHARP), one of two
rival citizens' groups that have sprung up around the battlefield.
   Tom Clemens, president of the Save Historic Antietam Foundation
(SHAF), says, ``There are still people in Sharpsburg who would just
like the whole battlefield and the National Park Service to go
away, and that isn't going to happen.''
   The latest fracas was touched off in 1985 when the zoning
commission approved a rezoning that paved the way for construction,
expected soon, of a shopping center next door to the privately
owned Grove Farm, where President Abraham Lincoln met with Union
Gen. George B. McClellan after the battle in which the forces of
McClellan and Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee fought to a virtual
draw and left 23,000 killed, wounded or missing. It will be the
first shopping center in this town of 800, which now has not a
single fast-food franchise.

   ``I was one of the people who was galvanized to action by that
particular incident,'' says SHAF president Clemens, who teaches
theater at Hagerstown Junior College and describes himself as ``a
Civil War fanatic.''
   ``We decided that we had just had enough.''
   Eric Seifarth, agricultural land preservation specialist for the
county planning department, said recently that Washington County
lost about 1,700 acres of farmland to development in fiscal 1989
and could have none left for the next generation if the rate
continues. He said there are between 50,000 and 80,000 acres of
prime farmland left in the 293,000-acre county.
   In a recent article in National Parks Magazine, Richard Rambur,
superintendent of the Antietam park, said that when he arrived in
August 1987, he found that 33 percent of the working population of
south Washington County was commuting to Washington or Baltimore,
each about 75 miles from Sharpsburg.
   In nearby Shepherdstown, W.Va., the population is expected to
double within five years with the advent of a new housing
development for nearly 2,000 people, Rambur said in an interview.
   The trend is indeed becoming obvious. The argument is over what
to do about it.
   ``It's not just simply a case of `The developers are coming, the
developers are coming.' It's a question of who are the
developers,'' said Ann Corcoran, a SHARP member who, with her
husband, Howard, operates a 300-acre farm adjacent to and partially
within the battlefield.
   The county established a 23-member commission of farmers,
realtors and others and in June 1989 adopted its final product, a
plan called the Antietam Overlay. It requires review of all new
home construction in the 2,900 acres surrounding the 815-acre
battlefield, lays down standards to make commerical buildings on
approach roads compatible with the historic character of the area,
and calls for an approved forestry plan for timber clear-cutting on
nearby Red Hill.
   At this point, SHARP was formed, telling area residents in a
letter it ``suspected that the enactment of the Overlay was ... the
beginning of a larger scheme to preserve the viewshed around the
battlefield to make it more attractive to tourists and commercial
developers.'' The organization also maintains that restrictions in
the Overlay would make modern farming more difficult. SHAF, on the
other hand, supports the Overlay.
   SHARP proposed a plan under which landowners around the
battlefield would sell development rights to their property, at a
suggested $4,000 an acre, to keep it in agricultural use. About
half the money would come from the state and the rest would be
raised from private sources. The organization also filed suit
challenging the Overlay. The county has asked that the suit be
dismissed.
   The Park Service has developed three alternatives for the future
of the battlefield.
   One alternative calls for keeping the battlefield basically as
it is. The second calls for expanding the park by as much as 250
acres to take in the Grove Farm and other sites, eliminating fences
and roads and taking other steps to make such battlegrounds as the
Miller cornfield and the eroded gulley known as Bloody Lane look
more as they did in 1862. The third is a compromise between the
two. Rambur predicts there will be further compromise before some
plan is adopted in six months or so.
   The state of Maryland is also interested.
   At a meeting in January at the battlefield visitors center, Gov.
William Donald Schaefer announced plans for a non-profit trust that
would combine private grants and charitable contributions to
augment state and county payments for land development rights.
   This plan is more historically oriented and would impose more
severe restrictions on development than the agricultural easements
envisioned by SHARP.
   Millard and Nancy Kefauver, meanwhile, continue living inside
the park boundaries in their privately owned home, which served as
a Union field hospital during the battle.
   ``We sort of felt like we knew as much about protecting it as
the Park Service did,'' Mrs. Kefauver says.
   ``They are very nervous and concerned about what plans the Park
Service has for them,'' Ms. Corcoran says.
   In Washington, preservationists have a different concern. They
are pushing for legislation intended to give federal protection to
endangered historic sites somewhat like the protection now given to
endangered species of wildlife.
   ``It really is remarkable to say that the snail darter enjoys
more federal protection than the Antietam Battlefield,'' says J.
Jackson Walter, president of the National Trust for Historic
Preservation.

   In the two years since his appointment to the
U.S. Supreme Court was rejected, Robert Bork has found a new forum.
From his base at a conservative think tank he has become a
best-selling author and he's soon to hit the lecture circuit. No,
he doesn't think he will ever get another shot at the high court.

   The man who would have been a member of the
U.S. Supreme Court and was stingingly rebuffed by the Senate is
quick to smile at the irony the last two years have brought.
   Robert Heron Bork does not dwell on past disappointments. In
fact, he sees himself having a bigger impact on the law from the
sidelines than he would have had from the bench.
   He says he is taking his case to a higher court, the American
public and the next generation.
   One reason why is that Robert Bork, former Marine, former
practicing lawyer, former Yale professor of law, former solicitor
general, former professor at Yale again, former judge of the U.S.
Circuit of Appeals, is now a best-selling writer.
   To his surprise, ``The Tempting of America, The Political
Seduction Of The Law,'' has been on the best-seller list for more
than 10 weeks, and there are more than 190,000 copies in print.
   Has that vindicated his views? ``I never felt the need for
vindication,'' he says with a chuckle.
   Bork was nominated for the Supreme Court in July 1987 and four
months later the Democrat-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee,
after an often vitriolic debate, found him unfit for the job. His
strict constructionist views of the Constitution threatened the
inclusion of women's rights under the 14th Amendment, and evoked a
public outcry from blacks and labor.
   In the political undercurrent it was also remembered that Bork
as solicitor general dismissed special prosecutor Archibald Cox
during the Saturday Night Massacre in the Nixon administration.
   Sitting in his office at the American Enterprise Institute, his
back to his word processor, he briefly considers what might have
been:
   ``I don't want to spend the rest of my life reliving it. I have
other things to do.''
   He recalls the impact of a book he wrote a dozen years ago on
antitrust law. ``A lot of people were good enough to say it had a
great influence on moving antitrust laws from where they were to
where they are now.''
   ``I hope in the same way to have some effect with this one,'' he
says, pointing out the antitrust book had a greater impact than a
few opinions he might have handed down from the bench.
   ``You know if you are on a court, you are one vote. And you
can't sit down and write 300 pages of connected argument to show
why this is the right approach.
   ``I think this book has the chance to have more impact. I think
I am talking to the next generation.''
   He says he has has received more than 200 letters from readers,
some short, some long, some funny, some analytical, all supporting,
he says. The law reviews have yet to come out, but one university
is planning four of them. The book is also planned for paperback,
which should reach a student audience.
   Bork has plans for perhaps two more books, one in more academic
detail on constitutional law aimed at law schools, and another on
the relationship of law and the culture. He will hit the lecture
circuit this spring and fall and will teach a constitutional law
course next year at George Mason University. Occasionally he writes
magazine commentary articles.
   Perhaps another shot at the court? ``I don't think so. I don't
think that's in the cards ... The first time around when I was
nominated for the Court of Appeals, the Senate approved me
unanimously, as did the committee.''
   But now he feels the Senate has taken a position on him that
would preclude its backing down.
   He relishes what free time he has. He is catching up on reading
he's not had a chance to do, making up for longtime neglect:
Flexner's four volumes on Washington, English philosopher John
Stuart Mill and his critics. He and his wife, Mary Ellen, eschew
most commercial television programs and rent videotapes instead.
   ``Popular culture as far as I'm concerned has gone straight
downhill,'' Bork says.
   During the hearings, Bork was astonished to learn that a radio
reporter had gone to the video store he frequents and obtained a
list of all of the tapes he had rented. ``I guess he was hoping for
something really scandalous, but all he got was Fred Astaire and
Cary Grant.'' There is now a law against giving out such lists.
   At his bedside table are mysteries, his other pastime, Martha
Grimes, Dorothy Sayers, John Dickson Carr, Margery Allingham. But
it's hard to follow a story when you read only four pages a night,
he says.
   The sedentary life has taken its toll. Asked what his ideal
weight would be, he smiles and offers an understatement, ``less
than it is now. I have to get myself back in shape so I can get
back to tennis. I used to like to ski but I wouldn't dare now.''
   He went skiing once when he was out of shape. He was halfway
down the slope, he says, ``when the muscles began to flutter and
that's not very good because you have to get down the rest of the
mountain.''
   Bork enjoys the atmosphere at the American Enterprise Institute,
the conservative think tank that has become his small university.
His colleagues include Irving Kristol, publisher of The National
Interest, former U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick, former State
Department arms negotiator Richard Perle and political, economic
and social commentators such as Ben Wattenberg, Michael Novak,
Norman Ornstein and Walter Berns.
   The institute does not make grave demands on its members. There
is an occasional brown-bag lunch where a speaker is brought in from
the outside.
   Bork, who abhored grading papers when he taught, says with a
self-satisfied grin, ``It's a very good faculty, with no blue
books.''
   The faculty often gets together for dinner. But, one suggests,
given that many active minds around the dinner table, the soup must
get cold.
   ``Not mine,'' says Bork.

   All five movies nominated as best picture of
1989 were films that Hollywood's heavy-hitters thought would be
financial flops. But their creators persisted and got the movies
made and Monday night one will walk off with the film industry's
top prize.

   The movies ``Born on the Fourth of July'' and
``Driving Miss Daisy,'' both shunned by the major Hollywood
studios, are the favorites to win Oscars when the film industry
honors its own Monday night.
   The 62nd Academy Awards extravaganza at the Los Angeles Music
Center will begin on ABC at 9 p.m. EST with Billy Crystal as master
of ceremonies. The show, hoping to improve on sagging TV ratings in
recent years, will feature satellite tie-ins from Moscow, Buenos
Aires, Argentina, London, Sydney, Australia, and Tokyo.
   The contenders for acting prize include 80-year-old Jessica
Tandy and Marlon Brando, 65, who both achieved fame 40 years ago
when they co-starred on Broadway in ``A Streetcar Named Desire.''
   Miss Tandy, the cranky dowager of ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' is
deemed the favorite in a difficult-to-predict race for best
actress. Michelle Pfeiffer, the sexy singer of ``The Fabulous Baker
Boys,'' is also highly touted.
   Leading the race for best actor are Tom Cruise, the disabled
veteran of ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' and Daniel Day-Lewis,
the cerebral palsy victim of ``My Left Foot.''
   Brando was nominated for best supporting actor for his role as
the liberal South African lawyer in ``A Dry White Season.'' The
unpredictable Brando accepted his first Oscar for ``On the
Waterfront'' in 1954 but spurned his second for ``The Godfather''
in 1972.
   Among the stars who will present the awards are Warren Beatty,
Jessica Lange, Jack Lemmon (from Moscow), Jack Nicholson, Steve
Martin, Rachel Ward and Bryan Brown (from Sydney), and last year's
acting winners, Jodie Foster, Geena Davis and Kevin Kline.
   All five nominees for best picture of 1989 were movies that all
of the major Hollywood studios spurned as being too special to
attract a wide audience. For instance, ``Driving Miss Daisy.''
   ``It was turned down by all the major companies,'' reports
Richard Zanuck, who produced the film with his wife, Lili. ``Then
we went to some of the minor players among the companies. No one
thought it was commercial. The consensus was that it would be a
nice movie with good reviews, but it couldn't attract a wide
audience.
   ``They also felt that it needed a stronger cast. By that time we
had locked in Jessica Tandy and Morgan Freeman on a pay-or-play
basis (meaning they would have to be paid whether they appeared or
not). They wanted a younger actress, like Meryl Streep, Shirley
MacLaine or Jane Fonda, who could be aged. But for a character that
started the film in her 70s and ended in her 90s, that seemed
impractical.''
   The Zanucks solved the problem by trimming the budget from $12.5
million to $7.5 million and cutting 20 days from the schedule.
Everyone on the production worked for lower salaries, including
latecomer Dan Aykroyd, who took the Zanuck offer of $150,000 vs.
his usual salary of $1-million plus.
   Warner Bros. agreed to pay $5 million for the U.S. releasing
rights and a London company provided $2.5 million for foreign
rights.
   ``It took two years before I could find anybody to consider
`Dead Poets Society,''' says Tom Schulman, who wrote the original
screenplay. ``Every agent turned it down, every studio turned it
down.
   ``They said it was a nice screenplay, but no picture about a
prep school had been successful. Besides, there were no girls in
the story, and it dealt with poetry.''
   Schulman stuck to his story about an English teacher who
inspires his students to creative thinking with bursts of poetry.
He finally interested producer Steven Haft who took the project to
Disney's Touchstone Pictures, where the script had previously been
rejected.
   First, Dustin Hoffman was scheduled to direct and star. But he
dropped out for ``Rain Man.'' Then director Peter Weir
(``Witness'') came aboard, followed by Robin Williams, who added a
whole new dimension to the role of teacher John Keating. ``Dead
Poets Society'' ended up with a $94 million gross in the United
States and Canada.
   Director-writer Phil Alden Robinson devoted six years to
bringing ``Field of Dreams'' to the screen. He first read W.P.
Kinsella's baseball fantasy ``Shoeless Joe'' in 1982 and tried to
interest the studios.
   ``I was turned down at every studio,'' remarks Robinson. ``I was
told, `We can see what you like in the novel, but it won't make a
movie.'''
   Finally, in 1985 Robinson found a taker. Lawrence Gordon, then
head of production at 20th Century Fox. The script was developed at
Fox, but then Gordon left for independent producing and ``Field of
Dreams'' went into ``turnaround,'' meaning it could be peddled to
other studios. Gordon and his producer-brother, Charles, took it to
Tom Pollock at Universal, who said yes even before a star had been
signed.
   ``Kevin Costner was not even on our list of possibilities
because he had just finished another baseball movie, `Bull Durham,'
'' Robinson recalls. But Costner learned about the script and
accepted immediately after reading it. The ``Field of Dreams''
domestic take _ $63 million.
   ``Born on the Fourth of July'' holds the record among this
year's best-picture nominees for length of time in reaching the
screen.
   Oliver Stone and Ron Kovic wrote the script, based on Kovic's
Vietnam experiences, in 1977-78. In 1979, Stone was on the brink of
directing the film with Al Pacino as star.
   ``But the money was not there; it wasn't considered
commercial,'' says Stone, who spent 10 years finding backers for
his ``Platoon'' (best picture, 1986). ``Ten years later, Tom Cruise
took an interest in it, `Platoon' was a success and Universal
Pictures, which had originally killed the picture, came back and
financed it.''
   Producer Noel Pearson didn't even canvass the major studios for
backing of ``My Left Foot,'' realizing a film about a cerebral
palsy victim would attract a chilly reaction. Production began in
Dublin, Ireland, with no assurance of financing, using his own
money, plus donations from a friend and Irish television. Slowly he
accumulated enough for the budget _ ``under $3 million.''
   The same pattern of rejection of Academy Award nominees by the
big studios has occurred increasingly in recent years. Why?
   ``I think it's the cost factor,'' theorizes Richard Zanuck.
``Even with smaller pictures, the cost of advertising and prints
can amount to a major investment. The studios naturally avoid
projects that they consider `dangerous' or not in the mainstream.
   ``But `Driving Miss Daisy' and the other nominees have proven
that audiences are hungry for material that is not devoted to
rapes, car crashes, murder and blood.''

   After years of trying to predict the winners
of the Academy Awards, I proceed with caution. Here goes:
   Picture: a photo finish between ``Born on the Fourth of July''
and ``Driving Miss Daisy.'' Because the Academy prefers feel-good
movies, it looks as if everything's coming up Daisy's.
   Actor: another close one, between Tom Cruise (``Fourth of
July'') and Daniel Day-Lewis (``My Left Foot''). If ``Fourth of
July'' wins best picture, it could be Cruise. Otherwise, Day-Lewis.
   Actress: Jessica Tandy (``Driving Miss Daisy'') seems
unbeatable, but Michelle Pfeiffer (``The Fabulous Baker Boys'')
could surprise.
   Supporting actor: Martin Landau (``Crimes and Misdemeanors''),
with Denzel Washington (``Glory'') a possibility.
   Supporting actress: wide open, with Julia Roberts (``Steel
Magnolias'') and Brenda Fricker (``My Left Foot'') the leaders.
   Director: Oliver Stone (``Fourth of July''), since Bruce
Beresford (``Driving Miss Daisy'') was not nominated.

   Few people know that Walloon Lake in Michigan
was a sometime home to one of America's most famous writers of this
century, Ernest Hemingway. But so far as some old-timers care, the
youth who grew up to write ``For Whom the Bells Toll'' and ``The
Sun Also Rises,'' only passed this way.

<DATELINE>HORTON BAY, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Hemingway cottage on Walloon Lake
is unmarked. Locals say Ernest Hemingway's younger sister, Sunny,
took down the historical plaque that pointed out Windemere, the
summer home where Ernest played, fished and took his bride.
   Sunny still summers here.
   Sunny _ Mrs. Madelaine Miller, 85 _ also asked the Petoskey
Chamber of Commerce to stop giving directions to the low, white
house among the cedars.
   No matter. Hemingway fanatics on their summer pilgrimages find
it anyway.
   It is Hemingway's Michigan that is elusive.
   ``They don't know what they're looking for,'' says Melissa
Creasey. With her mother she manages the 114-year-old Horton Bay
General Store four miles from Windemere.
   Creasey sells pizzas and T-shirts to the pilgrims and answers
their questions. ``They ask, `Is this the place?'''
   It is. Hemingway described the false-front store with its wide
porch in ``Up in Michigan,'' a scandalous story about the rape of a
Horton Bay woman. It was one of his earliest published stories.
   But that isn't what the fans want to know.
   They want whatever it was here that flamed the son of an Oak
Park, Ill., doctor into the burning bright writer who crystalized
the ripple of a trout stream or the seduction of an Indian girl.
   ``They want to know why it influenced Hemingway,'' says Bill
Ohle, 79, a retired ad man from Chicago whose grandfather
constructed many of the buildings around Horton Bay.
   Ohle lives down the lane from the store, in his father's hilltop
cabin overlooking Lake Charlevoix. There's a landscape painted by
Hemingway's mother hanging over the fireplace.
   The pilgrims want something larger than life, some sign of the
emerging greatness, Ohle says. What they find are stories about a
boy nobody much noticed.
   Ohle was a scrawny-legged kid while a teen-age Ernest Hemingway
freeloaded chicken dinners at Liz Dilworth's boarding house across
the street and cast for trout on the bay at the bottom of the hill.
   He remembers Ernest fishing, Ernest courting cousin Marjorie
Bump, 22-year-old Ernest bringing his St. Louis fiancee Hadley
Richardson to Horton Bay to get married in 1921 in a church since
torn down. He remembers Ernest and his bride leaving a few weeks
later and never coming back.
   ``Half a dozen of his better short stories are about this
here,'' Ohle said, gesturing about him. ``It made a deep impression
on the guy. He had a ball out here.''
   It was wild then. It was a kid's dream. Those were days when a
boy could steal away from his mother's cottage and catch trout and
sleep under the stars. The roads were dusty logging trails. Indians
lived in the woods.
   Ohle points out the window toward a dark strip of land jutting
across the sparkling water. That's where Ernest loved to fish.
That's the point where Hemingway's young Nick Adams rowed to that
last night with his girl in ``The End of Something.''
   How's the fishing now? No one knows. The point is privately
owned and trespassing isn't allowed.
   Hemingway spent every summer of his youth at Walloon Lake. In
1918, just 19, he went to Italy as an ambulance driver. He returned
from World War I with wounds from 227 pieces of shrapnel in his
legs and took up residence in a boarding house in Petoskey, a hilly
port town six miles to the north next to Lake Michigan. He also
earned the reputation of a ruffian.
   While Hemingway's mother, four sisters and baby brother still
summered at Windemere, Ernest crossed Walloon Lake and walked over
four miles of rolling hills, potato fields and apple orchards to
Horton Bay. He slept up the hill in the back shed at the Dilworths'
boarding house.
   Lives changed. Hemingway's father killed himself, just as
Hadley's father had done. Ernest killed himself. His sister Ursula
and his brother, Leicester, killed themselves.
   Michigan changed. Wealthy resorters built 22-room log cabins
with three-car garages amid the tiny cottages on Walloon Lake.
Petoskey exploded into a commercialized tourist town. The beanery
where Hemingway once ate now sells resorter clothes. It's open only
in the summer.
   Today, developers on Lake Charlevoix advertise $325,000
waterfront condominiums on ``Hemingway Pointe'' with a slip ``which
will accommodate your 55-foot yacht.''
   Biographer Constance Cappel, in her 1977 book ``Hemingway in
Michigan,'' quotes an old chum asking Hemingway if he would ever
come back.
   ``No,'' he replied. ``It's too civilized now.''
   Only Horton Bay, a logging town on the skids when Hemingway saw
it, looks the same. Its population has shrunk to 47.
   Hemingway returned in his writing, casting northern Michigan
places and people in one novel and a dozen short stories about
birth and death and sex and trout.
   Fact and fiction flew together like particles in an atom
smasher. Hemingway exchanged the Fox River for the Two-Hearted
River some 45 miles away. He turned girlfriends into lovers.
   Very real people got hurt. Marjorie Bump for one. The red-headed
girl with the easy smile who waited tables at Dilworth's became
Marge, jilted by Ernest's autobiographical Nick Adams in ``The End
of Something'' and later fantasized about in ``The Three-Day Blow.''
   ``She lived in terror of Hemingway,'' Ohle says of his cousin.
``They were obviously childhood sweethearts ... Then he goes and
writes her real name in a couple of stories. All through life
people discovered she was the Marjorie in the stories.
   ``She never got away from it. It plagued her. I think this was
her first love, really. But half the time it turned to hate.''
   Marjorie Bump died a few years ago.
   ``I hate to say it, but I haven't read too much of Hemingway,''
says Kris Woodruff, the Petoskey librarian.
   Yet Hemingway stood in the library with his cane and rakish
Italian officers' cape the winter of 1919 and told the Ladies' Aid
Society about the horrors and glories of war.
   Rex Miller, the head librarian, says Hemingway's writing is
``interesting ... but my tastes run in other directions. I can take
him or leave him and mostly I leave him.''
   Mostly, Horton Bay has left Ernest Hemingway, just as completely
as he left Horton Bay. The general store has faded pictures of him
on the walls, a few Hemingway T-shirts, a Hemingway book lies on
the coffee table by the front window.
   But few around remember the rough-hewn youth with a vivid
imagination.

   Coincidentally with the release of the movie
``Glory,'' a new book by a military science expert also tells of
the experiences of the black soldiers who served under mostly white
officers during the Civil War. The author, by the way, recommends
the movie.
</TEXT>

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Texas scholar who recently published a book
about black soldiers in the Civil War says the popular movie
``Glory'' almost got it right.
   Almost. But he liked the movie anyway.
   Joseph Glatthaar, an associate professor at the University of
Houston, spent four years researching his newly released book,
``Forged in Battle: The Civil War Alliance of Black Soldiers and
White Officers.''
   Glatthaar says it was exciting to see the lives of soldiers he
has studied come to life on the screen, but he notes some
inaccuracies in the film, which coincidentally came out about the
same time as his book.
   ``The movie's very good _ I strongly recommend it,'' Glatthaar
says. ``What the movie is good at is conveying a sense to the
observer of what it was like to be in these black units and what
were some of the obstacles that they faced.''
   But from a strictly historical standpoint, there are some
problems, he says.
   One example is the scene in which Robert Gould Shaw, the white
commander of the 54th Massachusetts Regiment, orders a soldier
flogged.
   ``Flogging was illegal in the United States Army,'' Glatthaar
says. ``Shaw would have been discharged from the service if he did
that.''
   Glatthaar says the Hollywood version also included a fictitious
sergeant-major as Shaw's right-hand man.
   ``In reality, the sergeant major of the 54th Massachusetts was
the son of the abolitionist and former slave Frederick Douglass,
which in itself is very interesting,'' he says.
   Glatthaar has read hundreds of letters exchanged between the
soldiers and their families, as well as thousands of military
documents from library archives.
   ``There was no censorship of mails and people were very prolific
with their own family or their own spouse and that's very
revealing, as far as racial attitudes go,'' he says.
   It was a letter from a white officer in charge of black soldiers
that initially got Glatthaar's attention.
   ``I do not think that I would exchange my position in this
regiment for one of equal rank in any white regiment,'' the officer
wrote his brother.
   Glatthaar says he was intrigued by the strange alliance between
the white officers and black soldiers, many of them former slaves
who were apprehended as ``contraband'' from the South.
   ``Of course, you have the old situation with whites in power,''
he says. ``Most of the blacks are from slavery, so it's a position
to which they're accustomed, but not happy with. And, of course,
these blacks are experiencing freedom for the first time in the
military, and that's a strange situation, too.''
   Some 178,000 blacks served under 7,000 white officers in the
U.S. Colored Troops during the Civil War. Only 110 blacks were able
to become officers in their own regiments.
   Even before President Abraham Lincoln officially freed slaves in
January 1863, black soldiers were recruited to fill the gaps left
by casualties in the Union Army.
   Glatthaar notes that black soldiers suffered the indignities of
lower wages, undesirable assignments and dwindling supplies. But
for many, it was a unique opportunity to serve as ``an equal'' to
whites and to establish their rights for themselves by fighting
their former owners.
   But the white officers directing black troops were not popular
back home.
   ``They were heroes in the black community, but they were
despised by whites,'' Glatthaar says. ``A lot of them were attacked
and brutalized and their families abused.''
   But Glatthaar says the most shocking indignities were those
inflicted on black troops after the war.
   ``What really surprised me most was the way the white population
took away the accomplishments of the United States Colored Troops
after the war,'' Glatthaar says. ``They denied their achievements.''
   Black soldiers who remained as peace-keeping forces in the South
during Reconstruction often suffered reprisals from former
Confederate soldiers.
   In the North, their fellow Union Army soldiers and officers
began discounting their abilities.
   ``Blacks, I think, wisely felt that their white officers should
have fought to help them gain full, equal rights,'' he says. ``The
white officers never overcame their prejudice.''
   Glatthaar says the battle for equality continued in the military
ranks for years to come.
   ``In World War I,'' Glatthaar says, ``they went through the
exact same issues, the exact same accusations that blacks didn't
have the character to stand up in combat, that they would all drop
their weapons and run, or that they would act like savages and
fight uncontrollably and we couldn't trust them.
   ``They just denied the fact that 178,000 soldiers had performed
superbly in the Civil War. They were reinventing the wheel in World
War I and, in fact, again in World War II.''

   John Neville, the comic British butler on
NBC's ``Grand,'' doesn't apologize for forsaking the Shakespearean
stage for a Hollywood sitcom.
   It's not the first time that Neville has given his career an
unusual twist, nor is it the first time he's been taken to task for
it.
   He was a matinee idol on the London stage and an heir to the
crown of Laurence Olivier when he abruptly moved to Canada in the
early 1970s. Last year he resigned as artistic director of the
Stratford Festival in Canada.
   ``I know what people are saying,'' Neville said in an interview
shortly before returning to London to star in ``School For
Scandal'' at the National Theater. He first starred in the play at
the Haymarket Theater in 1962.
   ``They never say it to your face. They say, `Well, he's sold out
and gone to Hollywood.' I say, `Well, I'm going back to the
National Theater in London.'''
   Desmond, the redoubtable butler he plays in ``Grand,'' probably
would offer a more cheeky response. Desmond trades quip for quip
with his cranky master, once bedded one of the boss's wives and for
a time feared he was the real father of the boss's son.
   The comedy, whose quirky plot twists and unpredictable
characters are reminiscent of ``Soap,'' made its debut in January.
Its time slot after ``The Cosby Show'' and ``Cheers'' on Thursday
have so far given it a charmed life.
   ``This is work I've never done before,'' Neville says. ``I've
done virtually everything else. I was attracted to the quality of
`Grand.' It gives me a lot of pleasure. I've never in my career
experienced a five-day week. Which at my age is rather pleasurable,
especially in California.''
   Neville and his wife have an apartment here, but have kept their
home in Stratford. Five of their children live in Canada and one
lives in England. He would like to do more film work. In 1988 he
played the title role in the movie ``The Adventures of Baron
Munchausen.''
   He had resigned as head of the Stratford Festival before he was
offered the role in ``Grand.''
   ``I had no idea what I was going to do next,'' he says. ``That's
been the story of my life. I've run theaters for 25 years. I've
always given notice early, having no idea what I would do. Each
time something has always come up.
   ``What attracted me was the quality of the writing. The show was
created by Michael Leeson, who wrote `Taxi' and the movie `The War
of the Roses.' I'd never done a sitcom before.''
   ```Grand' follows the lives of eight people in a small
Pennsylvania town. That's difficult to do. It's unusual for a
sitcom because it has a kind of serial feel. One show follows
another. You get to know the characters, but it may take some time
to find an audience. People remind me that it took `Hill Street
Blues' two years to find an audience.''
   Neville did very little television in Canada, although he had
done quite a lot in England. He starred as the Duke of Marlboro,
one of Britain's greatest generals and an ancestor of Winston
Churchill, in the BBC miniseries ``The First Churchill.'' It was
the series that launched PBS's ``Masterpiece Theatre'' in 1971.
   He was at the Old Vic where he did nothing but Shakespeare for
six years. He became a matinee idol in ``Alfie,'' then quit to
become artistic director of the Nottingham Playhouse. He was
awarded the Order of the British Empire in 1965.
   Neville admits it was a major disappointment when he wasn't even
approached about the movie role of ``Alfie'' given to Michael Caine
in 1966.
   In 1972, he abruptly quit England for Canada. ``I had been asked
to Ottawa to direct `The Rivals' for four weeks,'' he says. ``I had
a very successful and illustrious career in England, but I never
went back. I fell in love with Canada. I moved my wife and children
there. My wife wasn't surprised, because I've always done kind of
wayward and unexpected things in my career.
   ``I've had no regrets about the moves I've made. I consider
myself a North American. England isn't what it was when I grew up.''
   Prior to ``Grand,'' Neville completed four years at the
Stratford Shakespearean Festival, a three-theater complex with a
total of 3,800 seats.
   ``That's a lot of seats to fill,'' he says. ``People came from
all over Ontario, from Chicago, Ohio and even California. We did 12
to 13 plays a year, with three plays running at once. It's
predominantly Shakespeare, but we did `Cat on a Hot Tin Roof' last
year.
   ``We had a $4.5 million debt when I took over. That's a lot for
a theater. I paid off the debt and left a healthy profit. I'm very
good at that. I should run a movie studio.''

   For some people, ``A Chorus Line'' was more than
a musical. It was a way of life.
   Alyce Gilbert has worked on Broadway's longest-running show
since the beginning, from its first preview performances at the New
York Shakespeare Festival Public Theater in April 1975 to its
opening at Broadway's Shubert Theater the following July and
throughout its 15-year run.
   Now, her job and those of its 58 other production people, 26
musicians and 34 dancers will end March 31 when ``A Chorus Line''
closes after 6,104 performances.
   Gilbert is the musical's wardrobe mistress, a quaint title for
someone who must deal with four loads of dirty laundry every
workday _ and twice on matinee days. That's not to mention her
finding, getting repaired and keeping track of shoes, socks,
buttons, glass beads, leotards, pants, jump suits, jackets and top
hats during what usually is a 12-hour day or longer.
   ``Wardrobe is about continuity,'' says the woman who first
looked after costumes at age 12 for a children's theater company in
her hometown of Milwaukee. ``It's not design. It's about things
staying the same or kept within a certain parameter.''
   Gilbert has the responsibility of maintaining the show's
costumes designed by three-time Tony winner Theoni V. Aldredge. She
has had to make the replacement clothes look the way Aldredge
intended them to look a decade and a half ago. That can mean a lot
of problems.
   ``You're dealing with some things that are rather firmly rooted
in the fashion of 1975 that don't exist anymore,'' Gilbert says.
   For one thing, dance clothes have changed. When ``A Chorus
Line'' first opened, dancewear mostly was nylon Helanca. Now, it's
Milliskin, made out of Lycra, a shiny, spandex fiber, that prevails.
   ``Everything in the world is made out of that now,'' Gilbert
says. So the musical's nylon dance clothes have to be specially
ordered. And then all the dancewear, except for the women's black
leotards, has to be dyed.
   ``Theoni's colors are very specific,'' Gilbert says. ``All the
women in the show wear some kind of red, from pink to lavender to
burgundy to maroon. The men are dressed in blues, browns and greens.
   ``We took the bell-bottoms out of the pants in 1981. It took a
long time before they went out of dance pants primarily because it
makes your legs look longer and that's something dancers always
love.''
   Gilbert has witnessed not only a revolution in dancewear but a
change in the shapes of the dancers themselves.
   ``It used to be a very long, thin chorus line,'' she says.
``Over the 15 years, it's become a much more athletic body. Dancers
go to gyms. They pump. They do very distinct things to build bulky
muscles which you never saw in 1975. It was not aesthetically
pleasing then, but somewhere along the line, the public's eye
changed and so did the choreographer's'.''
   Gilbert's workday usually has begun at 10 a.m. in the basement
of the Shubert in a catacomb-like space crammed with racks and
boxes of costumes in every size and color.
   ``It's the buy-it-when-you-see-it-and-keep-it syndrome,'' she
laughs. ``We've got a lot of weird stuff around.''
   Here she starts the day's first load of laundry. The dancewear
is washed after each performance in a cold-water detergent. The
glittery finale costumes are pressed and checked for broken beads.
Different dressers _ the show has five _ have ``bead-in'' calls to
go over the finale costumes to replace beads.
   ``That costume has become a symbol of what Broadway is,''
Gilbert says. Director Michael Bennett originally asked Aldredge
for red finale clothes, similar to what he had used in ``Follies,''
but she came up with her own unique design.
   ``It is based on everything being reflected,'' Gilbert says.
``Everything shines. The fabrics. The shoes. The men's are patent
leather, the women's are satin. The beads are glass. When the light
hits those clothes, they look gold. They look silver. They look
white. It's amazing what vanishes from them in terms of wear.''
   During the day, Gilbert deals with whatever has to be replaced
or repaired. Toward evening, the stage manager wanders by and
announces who will be on stage that night. ``A Chorus Line'' is a
show in which understudies get a chance to perform frequently. That
means hauling out finale costumes for the replacement dancers.
   About a half hour before curtain, the five dressers come in. The
dancewear has been separated onto hangers, one costume to a hanger,
and sent to the dressing rooms.
   While the musical starts, the finale costumes are set on racks
at the side of the stage for the evening's splashy closing number.
During the show, Gilbert and the dressers fuss with the costume
worn by Cassie, the lead female dancer, and then get ready for the
finale. When the dressers go to help with the dancers' finale
changes, Gilbert goes, too. She personally hands out the top hats
to them.
   ``You're dealing with 17 people and 17 hats that look the
same,'' she says. ``We don't keep the hats with finale costumes
because it's dark. It's easy to come up with the wrong hat if
you're not focusing on that.''
   The process is repeated eight times a week.
   ``You're in a rather unique position doing wardrobe,
particularly in this show,'' says Gilbert, who got her start in
1968 doing shows off-Broadway. ``I've learned that dancers are
really so gallant. They can be silly. They can be petty. They can
be lots of things. But when they have to go out and dance, there's
an extraordinary bravery.
   ``All dance ever really gives them is the chance to be able to
do it. Anything else is extra.''
   Gilbert took two 6-month leaves from ``A Chorus Line'' over the
years to work on two other Bennett shows, ``Ballroom'' and
``Dreamgirls.'' She always came back.
   When ``A Chorus Line'' closes, she'll move over to ``Grand
Hotel,'' the Tommy Tune musical that has lavish 1920s-style
costumes. ``And then there will probably be other shows,'' she adds
wistfully.

   When designers parade bare-breasted togas or molded
breastplates, clown suits or dresses shot full of holes like Swiss
cheese, what is the point? Are these meant to be worn, or is this
just hype?
   The answer is not always obvious. Designers do show off to
attract attention, but sometimes their ``jokes'' sell well and turn
into real fashion.
   A recent case in point is Saint Laurent's famous draped crepe
Greek dress, which the model in his show wore with one shoulder
pulled off to bare the breast.
   ``But that was just a wink for the audience,'' says house
spokesman Clara Saint. ``We certainly didn't expect anybody to go
out on the street half naked. The dress is selling _ but the way it
was meant to be worn, firmly and modestly hiding the bosom.''
   Back in 1972, Saint Laurent's haute couture collection revived
the 1940s look, featuring shoulder pads, platform-soled shoes and
other oddities, evoking a cry of ``ugly'' from the Herald-Tribune's
influential Eugenia Sheppard.
   But what appeared on the streets a few months later? Platform
soles, shorter skirts, even shoulder pads.
   The pads really took off when fashion cowboy Claude Montana
turned them into gridiron shapes worthy of Joe Montana. Not
everyone went for the incredible hulk shape, but many agree even
now that a bit of padding in the shoulders helps distract from too
much natural padding on a woman's hips.
   Paris's most notable jokester is Jean-Paul Gaultier, whose
outrageous styles and zany shows keep the fashion press buzzing.
   His sex-centricities have included Amazon breastplates, corsets
and garter belts for party wear, concierges' aprons and knit skirts
for men. A lot of this stuff has sold.
   ``I design clothes with an eye to what people want,'' Gaultier
says. ``If you see lacy garter belts, that's because I think that
people want a sign of a return to sexier styles in general.''
   He explains that his exaggerations are to make a point. ``What
looks outlandish is kind of a resume of my whole collection,'' he
says. ``And I do design for people in the street. There are a lot
of fat people out there, and I dress them up in my collections,
too.''
   ``I think designers are indeed making a statement with some of
those way-out styles,'' says Carol Mongo, a professor at Parsons
School of Design, Paris branch.
   ``For example, when they show transparent blouses without
underwear, they don't necessarily advocate see-through nudity for
everybody. The idea is to look for more feminine styles, light
fabrics, a certain transparent effect.''
   She notes that ``those draped Esther Williams bathing-suit
dresses at Ungaro a couple of seasons ago were just pointing the
way to shorter skirts.''
   And about Gaultier's metal-tipped clodhoppers, she observes:
``Those funky objects resembling S-and-M jobs finally filtered
right down to the marketplace in cheaper copies.''
   The Japanese are notable for showing inscrutable fashions that
excite the jaded fashion crowd but confound women on Main Street.
   When Rei Kawakubo at Comme des Garcons came out with her
drop-dead bag lady clothes shot full of holes, Vogue's fashion
editor, Polly Mellon, practically levitated out of her chair.
Others scratched their heads.
   ``But Rei meant that look to be taken seriously,'' says a former
executive with the company who declined to be named. ``This wasn't
gimmickry. If she put holes in the clothes, it was part of her
concept.''
   Christian Lacroix became a star comic creator when he pushed
bustles, flounces and even raccoon tails onto runways at Patou in
1985. But his spirited bustle and ruffle looks brought fun back
into fashion, and he was copied ad nauseam.
   ``I don't try to create shock waves just for effect,'' says
Lacroix. ``I'm simply trying to show clothes more as I'd like to
see them on the street _ which looks so sad nowadays compared with
more daring styles paraded in past decades or centuries.''
   He denies trying to dazzle the fickle press, ``who are totally
blase, in any case.''
   But he adds that ``we do feel we have to fill up a runway with
the most spectacular clothes to attract a huge audience. That's why
I've chosen to hold my ready-to-wear shows in my salon _ to create
a more cozy, couture ambience.''
   He says that what appears in magazines is often a distortion of
what the clothes look like in real life. ``You see extreme images,
fantasies created by fashion editors and photographers, symbols of
the era that are more cerebral inventions than reality.''
   It's Gaultier, however, who usually takes the cake for oddity.
Even fashion guru John Fairchild, the headmaster of Women's Wear
Daily and ``W,'' who has seen it all, can be shocked at Gaultier's
gall.
   In his book, ``Chic Savages,'' he wrote: ``When I saw his models
wearing bralike tops and garter belts, I felt distaste, for to me
this was fashion bordering on the grotesque _ like a show in some
sleazy Hamburg bar.''
   However, Fairchild modestly admitted, like many bemused
fashion-watchers, ``But then I'm a square, or so I'm constantly
being told.''

   Soft and subtle or bright and brassy, this spring's
styles are feminine from sexy top to high-hemmed bottom. The
silhouette for the early 1990s, whether naughty or nice, is softly
rounded to the female form.
   The modern suit look is often based on bi- or multicolor
combinations, with main interest on curvy jackets that plunge
around a full bust over tiny lean skirts or soft, tulip-wrapped
styles.
   Flowered silks and solids of acid green, hot coral or yellow
combine gorgeously at Ungaro, though in his top ready-to-wear the
price tag is about $2,000 for an outfit.
   Good news for many is that skirts in shops are often longer than
the runway versions.
   The most winning jackets may be long and double-breasted,
shortie rounded boleros, tulip-rounded at hems with curvy
sweetheart necklines, or decorated with dazzling white lapels on
navy. Karl Lagerfeld's asymmetrical scimitar shapes cut a handsome
white swath on his dark suits.
   Coat-dresses are very ``in'' this spring too, often with
contrasting silk cuffs and lapels. A handsome navy version at Guy
Laroche costs about $700 in Paris, slightly more in the States.
   Easy action is one big message of this season's lines. And if
you don't go for the short skirts, there are plenty of pants to
choose from.
   Even there, think short. The shorts are adorable, often full and
quite dressy, worn with jackets in a different color for a citified
look. Top a pair of bermudas with a typically braided and
gold-buttoned jacket and you've got the essence of the current
nymphet style at Chanel.
   There are also plenty of long and easy pants, cigarette-slim
cropped trousers and bicycle tights or corsairs for those who like
showing lean thighs at the beach.
   Transparency is a fresh look for next summer _ best at the house
of Chanel where designer Lagerfeld likes to play around with chic
long jackets in flesh tones of pink over similarly shaded little
wisps of chiffon skirts peeping out underneath.
   Look also for appealing chiffon blouses layered with floppy bows
to keep the look quite modest, and don't forget the light organzas.
Gianfranco Ferre at Dior is the couture master of this look. His
checked black and white flouncy short trapeze duster coats with a
huge bow at the neck would be a stunning addition to a chic woman's
wardrobe.
   Since couture is impossibly expensive, Dior's ready-to-wear
stylists have used the same idea, but for a less costly result.
   There are plenty of dream themes to spark up summer days and
nights. Animal stripes and spots are happy denizens of the Paris
fashion zoo, still tops at Jean-Louis Scherrer, who sees spots in
everything from suits to evanescent chiffon or georgette silk
late-day wear.
   Sailor styles still abound on the bounding fashion main, and the
shops are already full of nautically inspired separates:
gold-buttoned blue or white jersey or linen pea jackets, officers'
or mess jackets, navy shorts and corsairs, and striped T-shirts or
pants galore. Emanuelle Khanh's sailor line looks very handsome in
shades of burnt siena linen.
   Travelers will like the many versions of gabardine safari suits,
with lace-up versions particularly handsome at Saint Laurent.
   Folklore made a cautious return to the runways but so far
doesn't appear often in the shops, though Christian Lacroix
promises to do well with his vaguely Provencal or Indian
multicolored cotton prints and shiny brocades.
   In another vein, Yves Saint Laurent's ruffled, dotted Carmen
Miranda dresses and jeweled tops borrowed from the bullring are
opulent enough to attract all eyes at any kind of shindig.
   His off-shoulder white or navy draped Greek dresses looked
fetching as seen on models pulled down to bare a breast but are
currently being sold and worn to cover the whole chest.
   Besides bits of titillating immodesty like that, Paris is also
betting on warm-weather holidays with lots of bare-midriff ideas,
sarong skirts, strapless bustier or backless tops for dressy
late-day.
   Valentino teams a draped hot-colored print sarong skirt (over
$1000) with neatly fitted jackets in shades of peacock turquoise or
flame red linen jackets _ also pricey, though similar styles can be
found in less expensive labels.
   Fabrics for the feminine clothes are soft and sensual, even
linens and wools that never looked lighter. Cotton gabardine,
poplin and piques with flowery rather than waffled weaves have a
fresh appeal.
   Organza is the big new dressy staple, along with feather-light
chiffon, guipure lace and some wonderful bright gazars for evening
wear.
   The color palette is varied enough to suit anybody, from the
low-keyed browns, khakis and beige at Claude Montana to soft
pastels and hot shocking pink or corals at many houses, with
daffodil yellow, violet, liqueur or acid green to vary the menu.
   And as spring is synonymous with white and navy, they're already
in the shops, mainly in gabardine, textured linen and silk blends,
with higher prices at couturiers like Dior, Saint Laurent and
Valentino, slightly lower at Hanae Mori and Guy Laroche -- about
$650-800 for a suit in Paris, somewhat more in the U.S.
   Now that luxury ready-to-wear is excessively expensive, copyists
have been busily at work. What to look for is high-quality fabric
and a cut that works right on you.

   The unseasonably warm weather has brought spring to
Rome early this year. The cherry trees are already in bloom, the
sidewalks are cluttered with outdoor cafe tables, and picnickers
have started taking their lunches to the umbrella-pined city parks.
   Among the happiest about this sudden burst of spring are the
shop owners, who quickly ended winter sales to fill their stores
and decorate their windows with the bright and cheery Italian 1990
spring-summer collections.
   In fact, for the first time in almost a decade, the Italian
ready-to-wear designers have opted to abandon their trademark drab
shades in favor of the traditional Easter pastels and summer
Mediterranean or tropical palettes.
   Thus pale yellows, pinks and blues abound as well as rich tones
of orange, coral and green.
   Styles too are more frivolous than in past seasons. Along with
the usual tailored outfits which have made the Italian look famous
throughout the world, the spring-summer fashion includes lots of
frilly party dresses in demure prints.
   On the same line, it is a good year for passementerie fans, with
tassels, fringes and beads large and small appearing on everything
from a T-shirt to an evening gown.
   In recent years, Italian designers have led the fashion sexual
mores. The 1980s short skirt, a good five inches shorter than Mary
Quant even dreamed of when she invented the miniskirt some 20 years
ago, was born on the Milan runway.
   Long gone are the days when Italian women dressed in black and
wore scarves on their heads. Even more than in Paris, the streets
of Rome are filled with miniskirted women, proudly showing off
their legs.
   There are plenty of short skirts this spring, but the novelty in
body baring is above the waist. Shops are filled with such hot
weather items as bra tops, bandeaus, bustiers and halter tops.
   By day these enticing numbers come in summer prints and are worn
with tie skirts or low waisted pants, reminiscent of styles in the
tropics.
   For evening, bras and bustiers are encrusted with jewels and
shimmering sequins and worn with harem pants and sarong skirts to
recreate the mystery of an Arabian night.
   Suits and city clothes are few and far between in these new
collections with the accent heavily on the holiday spirit. Thus
along with their beach party clothes, the windows are laden with
yachting outfits, from silk scarves printed with nautical motifs,
baggy high-waisted navy blue pants, to sailor suit blouses complete
with wide collar. Gold buttons are everywhere.
   The halter dress, so popular for beach wear in the 1950s, is
back, as is a folk look of hip pants, vests and fringed scarves,
favorite items of the 1960s hippies crowd.
   Makeup for this spring and summer, in keeping with the demure
styles, is simple and natural. Hair styles tend to be short and
boyish. In general shoes are flat and comfortable, with the return
of the sandal after a season of closed-toe summer footwear.
   To dress up the young, fun-loving look, the designers propose
sophisticated heavy gold jewelry.
   Following are a few tips of where to find the best in Italian
spring-summer styles:
   Versace: The shortest skirts and most ornate bustiers.
   Fendi: Demure linen party dresses and personalized outfits
printed with your own sign of the zodiac.
   Ferre: See-through blouses, nautical styles, beautiful evening
gowns in silk floral prints and rich sequining.
   Armani: Hippie styles in his Emporio label, the softest fabrics
and prints of the season and extra long jackets for the Armani
label.
   Byblos: Cheery floral printed party dresses and lots of
easy-to-wear shorts and wraparound skirts.
   Krizia: The best in prim navy blue and white outfits.
   Missoni: Colorful polka-dotted and checked sun dresses and
pinafores. For spring chills, reversible hip-length jackets with
one side quilted and the other in heavy multi-colored wool knit.
   Genny: The only place for the city dweller, with a vast
selection of trim suits, neat blouses and no-nonsense skirts and
trousers.

   A reaction to public and corporate greed, a
resistance to high prices, and the reality of the workplace are
influencing American fashion today, says a fashion consultant who
has studied the effect of events on what people wear.
   ``Fashions are less flamboyant, less ostentatious,'' says Laura
Sinderbrand, an industry consultant and former director of the
design laboratory at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New
York City. ``This is in reaction to the greed we see around us.
   ``Opulence, especially in evening wear, has leveled off, without
the jewel-encrusted fabrics and glitter of recent years.''
   American designers, like Geoffrey Beene, Donna Karan, Michael
Leavitt or Gordon Henderson, are aiming their lines at working
women who aren't necessarily preoccupied with clothes but who want
things that are efficient and creative, she says.
   ``Much of the clothing you can wear all day. It has to look
right in the evening,'' she says. Increased attention to
accessories and versatility of designs enable working women to wear
the same clothes at work and after hours.
   The revival of the dress is one of the most significant trends
in l990s fashion, she thinks. ``Women are moving away from dressing
like men. We have a generation of women who are wearing dresses for
the first time, and they're finding it an exciting new experience.''
   Ms. Sinderbrand, who advises industry organizations like the
Crafted with Pride in U.S.A. Council, says she can chart the course
of current fashion while walking to work along Manhattan's Avenue
of the Americas (or Sixth Avenue). ``What I see being worn on Sixth
Avenue is a marvelous barometer of fashion. What's emerging are
skirts in softer shapes. Dresses. Long coats and sweaters. Soft
blouses with ruffles.''
   The careerist uniform of suit and bow tie worn by women with
board room ambitions has been for the most part phased out, which
she attributes to their increased self-confidence.
   American consumers are balking at expensive, extravagant
clothes, she says. ``Prices had been getting out of hand. The
working woman has a home, family and other demands on her money.''
   Designers are responding with well designed, less expensive
clothing. ``And these designs are not to the European conception,''
she says. Ms. Sinderbrand cites the strengths of American clothes:
They are well made, fit well, and are of good fabrics, she says.
   The major exception to the resistance to European influence is
the continued adaptation of Chanel design, which she terms a
``homage'' to the legendary French designer whose styles
effectively marked the end of Victorian and the beginning of 20th
century fashion.
   What have been the benchmarks of American design during this
century? ``Doing away with hobbled skirts and tightly laced
corsets. We are also more body and health conscious. Denims and
cotton work clothes are worn by everyone.
   ``This is the most dramatic statement we have made about
ourselves.''

   At the trendy Limited apparel stores around the
country, winter-weary shoppers have turned to polka dots and vivid
floral patterns in sprucing up spring wardrobes.
   Other retailers report favorable responses to the warm weather
fashions that started rolling out in late January. Racks and
shelves are stocked with ample merchandise in the latest colors and
styles.
   Even most of the department store chains operating under
bankruptcy court supervision _ as is Bloomingdale's, Bon Marche,
Lazarus and others _ have adequate selections.
   ``No consumer will have to go to Church on Easter Sunday without
a new dress or new suit,'' said Alan Millstein, publisher of a
monthly newsletter for the fashion and retail industries. ``There's
no shortage of apparel around.''
   But traditional department stores face some of the toughest
challenges yet in a continuing battle to maintain and build market
share.
   Specialty retailers boasting deep assortments of apparel have
pulled once die-hard department store patrons and now are making an
aggressive play for fashion-conscious adolescents, hoping hip
youngsters will become devoted customers of the future.
   Small shops are winning over increasing numbers of affluent
consumers. Fed up with the lackadaisical service at big stores,
they prefer the pampered attention boutiques offer.
   Off-price outlets selling national brands at discount, such as
Marshalls, also have made lasting inroads into the department store
customer base.
   Mass merchandisers, which have beefed up inventories to
supplement their house brands with widely known labels, are going
after disillusioned department store shoppers.
   ``The department store isn't the primary channel of distribution
for many consumers anymore,'' consultant Thomas Rauh said.
   Rauh, director of retail consulting for the accounting firm
Ernst &amp; Young, said department stores formerly held a position of
authority with the shopping public, dictating fashion trends and
buying patterns. ``In many cases, they have lost that authority
position.''
   Some retailers are aiming to wield more power in the department
store industry.
   Thanks to a repositioning started a few years ago, J.C. Penney
Co. Inc. has begun to attract people who previously wouldn't have
thought about shopping at a Penney's store. The emphasis now is on
apparel; gone are the paints, appliances and other ``hard'' goods
that in the past might have distracted a career woman shopping for
a business suit.
   Over the past decade as specialty stores, particularly The
Limited, increased their marketplace clout, department stores pared
down their offerings. Washers, dryers and furniture no longer are
standard fare at department stores.
   ``A lot of them are getting out of the business of trying to be
all things to all people,'' said Newton Godnick, chairman of the
fashion buying and merchandising department at the Fashion
Institute of Technology in New York.
   Walter Loeb, a New York-based retail consultant, foresees the
process possibly accelerating. He said department stores may opt
for greater depth and do away with breadth. More sizes and colors
might be carried in a particular dress style but fewer styles might
be carried overall, for instance.
   Price competition also is rampant as department stores cater to
shoppers now accustomed to the bargains at off-price chains. The
promotional price-cutting so conspicuous over the holiday season
will probably continue but at a slower pace.
   The financial problems of the department store chains operated
by Federated Stores Inc., the U.S. holding company of Canada's
debt-ravaged Campeau Corp., spawned price wars particularly in some
major markets in the peak pre-Christmas selling season. Many areas
of the country, though, weren't affected at all.
   Despite the challenges, department stores aren't dinosaurs.
Godnick of the Fashion Institute of Technology said he thinks of
them as elephants moving slowing as they change their approach in
an effort to keep old customers and attract new ones.
   ``My impression is that the department stores will weather the
storm,'' he said. ``But there is no question that they're having
some problems.''

   For men who tend to spill Burgundy on their blazers or pate on
their pants, there's good news from the male fashion front this
spring.
   According to one designer, the new season will bring
imaginative, refreshing colors onto the scene, such as ``asphalt,
blueberry, postal blue and claret red.'' There was no mention of
the stain-concealment advantages.
   For the ecology-minded, there will be ``new smoky shades, green
influences and rich heather,'' adds Italian designer Luciano
Franzoni.
   Other fashion consultants agree on the upsurge of the color
factor.
   And looking into the style crystal ball for the new decade,
Randy Ronning, men's fashion director of J.C. Penney Co. Inc., says
men have warmed to new roles as consumers of fashion.
   ``In the 1990s,'' Ronning explains, ``this will be demonstrated
by a new willingness to incorporate color into their business
wardrobes, as they have in casual dress, and make greater use of
stylish furnishings and accessories.
   ``Even more conservative dressers are updating their wardrobes
and expanding the range of styles they'll wear. There's been a
dramatic increase in sales of patterned dress socks and fancy
neckwear.
   ``Suits were the rule for a good part of the '80s, but now
sports coats, many of them with bold patterns and vibrant colors,
are starting to make a comeback that will extend well into the new
decade.''
   One particular sports coat _ the blazer _ has long been a
fixture in many men's wardrobes.
   Some fashion experts credit the blazer's social acceptability to
dancer Fred Astaire, the movie's best dressed actor of the '40s and
'50s, who wore the garment on and off the screen.
   The jacket's appeal was enhanced in the '60s by President John
F. Kennedy, who wore the blazer on trips to Hyannis and
occasionally at the White House.
   ``The blazer is a chameleon garment that fits into any man's
wardrobe perfectly,'' notes Mitchel Nichnowitz, president of Botany
500. ``This style is also a great weekend garment because it suits
almost any dress requirement in any part of the country,
eliminating the need to pack a lot when traveling.''
   Most recently, he says, the blazer has adjusted to fit the '90s
fashion direction and has gone soft in construction, giving it a
more casual feeling.
   ``To that end, wearing the blazer with jeans and a T-shirt is
the most up-to-date look that will take the '90s man to any
off-hours situation in great style,'' he adds.
   ``Yet, if the look is to be more formal, the same blazer
accompanied by dress shirt, tie and trousers, will feel just as
comfortable at business meetings or out on the town.''
   In addition to the emphasis on color, says Italian designer
Franzoni, the new season achieves greater refinement and
sophistication in smooth worsteds, soft wool blends, blends with
silk and multi-fiber mixtures.
   Fabrics focus on silk, fiscose, linen, cool-wool and cotton,
often in multiple combinations.
   The emphasis at Brooks Brothers, which claims to be the nation's
oldest clothing retailer, is more conservative.
   Mainstays of the company's spring suit collection are rich,
lightweight wools with ultra-soft hands, in classic gray chalk
stripes and subtle plaids, according to Peter Marsh, vice president
for men's tailored clothing.
   But also in evidence, he points out, are charcoal blues, muted
olives and black and white plaids.
   In a set of rules aimed at both men and women, Brooks Brothers
suggests that both avoid clothing trends.
   ``Consider the untimely demise of the latest miniskirt craze.
(Men are not exempt.) Watch the size of your lapels and the width
of your ties,'' it advises.

   The working woman often confounds the
expectations of clothing retailers, says a Miami University
marketing professor.
   ``The working woman is two different people. When she works, she
dresses one way, but when she plays she can be exactly the opposite
_ wild, daring, ultracasual, ultrasloppy,'' says Mel Schneck,
visiting executive professor of retailing at the university.
   This refusal to fit into a single mold both confuses stores and
make marketing to women more challenging, he says. And the working
woman continues to increase her clout at the cash register. ``She's
a smart spender. She's knowledgeable. She knows names. She knows
looks. She is aware and educated. She also needs clothes to enhance
her position at the firm.''
   Schneck thinks the ``dress for success'' formulas of the
mid-eighties, which included bankers' pinstripe suits, are on the
wane. That means a higher percentage of the fashion dollar is
shifting back toward dresses, increasingly favored by career women,
he says.

   The demands of women's careers and
work pushed home sewing to the side during the l970s, but the
search for quality contributed to its rise again in the l980s,
according to a Purdue University professor.
   Working women want better clothes than they're finding in the
stores, and if they don't have time to sew themselves, they look
for someone else to do it for them, says Lois Gotwals, assistant
professor and extension specialist in the university's consumer
sciences and retailing department.
   ``Those who have a talent for sewing are making a business for
themselves by doing alterations and making items for other
people,'' she says.
   ``All you have to do is send out a few flyers, put a sign out,
and you're swamped. I know of one woman who says if she could sew
for 12 weddings a year, she could make about $50,000.''
   The cost of clothing, which has risen sharply in the last few
years, also contributes to the renaissance of home sewing, which
was at an all-time high in the l960s before slumping during the
next decade. She points out that fabric and notions for a
top-quality lined wool or silk jacket cost about $70-$80, while a
comparable ready-made version couldn't be bought for less than
$400. A lined wool skirt priced at $80 in stores will cost about
$25 to make.
   Gotwals says that more people also are sewing for the home _
bedspreads, curtains, draperies, and table linens.
   More than two years ago, Gotwals, with the help of Purdue's
continuing education division, began compiling a data base with
information about where to find fabrics, notions and sewing
equipment. A resource list based on this data is available to home
sewers for $7.50. For more information, contact Gotwals at (317)
494-8356.

   There is sportswear, and then there is sportswear.
   Different types of clothing share the name. One simply denotes
informal fashion, another, often called ``active sportswear,'' is
meant for the playing fields or outdoors. Many clothes fall
somewhere between.
   The Aussie look can be found in a fashion sportswear line for
women from Palmer &amp; Palmer Australia, the North American
distributor of the Australian company. It features denim, rich
color prints, and safari-type jackets evocative of the bush. One
jacket has removable sleeves, so it can double as a vest.
   For Members Only takes its inspiration from traditional
clubwear, featuring updated polo shirts and golf, baseball, and
regatta jackets for men. Similarly, Jockey International has a new
collection of for men featuring golf cardigans, tennis sweaters,
running tanks and shorts.
   A new classic for men are Levi's Dockers, called the most
valuable product of l989 by the apparel trade magazine, DNR. These
easy-fitting pleated slacks have become one of best sellers in the
Levi's line, alternatives to body-hugging blue jeans.
   Clothes for tennis, running, team sports, or simply knocking
about can be found under the Reebok Sport label, part of the
apparel line of the athletic shoe company.
   Several collections from J. C. Penney also blur the line between
casual wear and active sports, such as cable and stripe pullover
sweater from the Hunt Club Collection or its J.T. Beckett tropical
print shirt and fair isle sweater. The store also has a new Kenny
Rogers' Classic Direction label, with tennis and sailing sweaters
and jackets with the imprimatur of the entertainer.
   Heavily textured and patterned handknit sweaters and floral
batik print shirts are featured in the spring Henry Grethel
collection.
   For clothes that can be worn both on the street and at the
exercise and and dance studio, Baryshnikov Bodywear and Marika
Fitness Apparel for women offer new collections of clinging, boldly
printed and brightly colored leotards, tights, tankshirts, and
coordinating loosely fitted T-shirts.
   Sports clothes designed for tough wear on the slopes and in the
field are found on the street, too. Columbia Sportswear offers ski,
sailing and fishing clothes for serious sports in its Intertrainer,
Interchange System and Windwear lines that recognize crossover
between different activities. Makers of the multi-colored ski
shells with zip-out linings, the company also offers a variety of
sports vests of many pockets for fishing, hunting or photography.

   Granted, it didn't come off a Paris runway. And you won't find
it in Wall Street board rooms. But it is one of the most pervasive
and constant fashions of the age: the T-shirt.
   According to industry figures, of $10 billion Americans spend
each year on active sportswear, $3.5 billion goes for T-shirts,
whether plain, imprinted, lengthened into T-shirt dresses or used
as nightwear. The industry claims that in the l980s, 200 million
Americans regularly wore T-shirts.
   ``T-shirts have moved up to high fashion and high profits,''
says Milt Anglin, general merchandising manager for T-Shirts Plus,
a national chain of stores specializing in what the trade now calls
``imprintable sportswear.''
   That category now covers sweatpants, hats and workshirts, but
the T-shirt is the mainstay.
   And printed shirts are being improved. The rubbery hot transfer
which the consumer had to avoid ironing over has been gradually
replaced with better printing techniques. Decorations are often
added, and some are rendered in ``spin art,'' an advanced form of
tie-dye. These are considered works of art by shirt designers like
Dino Calabrese of Transfermania, Inc., who describes them as
``wearable art.''

   The ubiquitous sneaker is the king of the road, not to mention
the walk, the playing court, the home and just about anywhere a
pair of feet can go.
   Ninety-three percent of all Americans over the age of 12 own at
least one pair of athletic shoes, and 87 percent wear them
regularly, says the Athletic Footwear Association.
   The organization commissioned what it says is the first major
study of the market for athletic footwear and discovered that the
average American owns 2.5 pairs of athletic shoes, a figure that is
constant among different segments of the population _ men, women,
teens, blacks, and whites. But young blacks 13 to 24 years old may
be the trendsetters; the study shows that 33 percent of them own
four or more pairs of sneakers, compared to 24 percent of all other
categories in that age group.
   Sales in l988 reached $9.7 billion , compared with the $4.2
billion figure recorded in l983.
   ``It's bigger than most people in the industry ever imagined,''
says Gregg Hartley, AFA executive director. ``Athletic shoes are
mainstream footwear, and the future of the industry depends on how
well the companies build on that position.''
   The study was underwritten by the AFA and the Sporting Goods
Manufacturers Association in an effort to learn more about
potential customer preferences.
   ``The market for sneakers is enormous, but it is also highly
segmented and complex,'' says Mel Roboff, who directs planning,
research and business development for Converse.
   Among other findings:
   _ Most Americans think of sneakers as casual footwear, and
almost no one wears them only for athletic activities.
   _ They want comfort and good fit; appearance and fashion mean
less than they do for casual non-athletic shoes.
   _ Despite special-purpose shoes for a specific sport or
activity, a large number of people who say they exercise regularly
do so in shoes other than those designed for that activity.
   _ Those surveyed said they spent an average of $30.13 on their
most recent pair of athetic shoes. The top price they would be
willing to pay averaged $41.96.

   News of shoes for spring, according to the National Shoe Fair of
America, an industry organization:
   For women, more sandals and straps. Wedge heels. Satin metallics
for daywear, mixed with other leathers and fabrics. More
sophisticated walking shoes. Increased interest in lower heels.
More color and metal touches. Perforations, punches, cutouts and
slashes. Emphasis on comfort features.
   For men, also a greater emphasis on comfort, including wider
array of casuals. Neutral shades, cast with green, blue, or red.
Two-tone ombre combinations. Fabric used in casuals and dress
casuals, including sandals and shoes influenced by athletic
footwear. More casual styling in dress shoes. More textures and
weaves. Handsewns that are dressier and more comfortable. Washable
leathers, showing motocycle influences. Dressy animal skins, low

   For girls, spectator looks. Touches of metal or metallics.
Cutouts and punches. Embroidery. Straps and swivels. Oblique casual

airy sandal in a variety of sizes, shapes and forms,'' says
Margaret Pennes of the NSFA. ``In terms of shape and design, the
trend is on a worldwide approach _ ethnic and folkloric designs
that evoke a feeling of sun-drenched faraway places like Java,
India, and the South Sea Islands.''
   _
   Best known for its loafers and mocassins, G. H. Bass is offering
a line of dressier shoes for both men and women. Pumps, plain or as
classic wingtips on stacked heels of various heights, are available
for women. The women's line also includes low-heeled oxfords with
plain or woven uppers. For men, there are dress loafers in penny,
tassel and kiltie designs. The company's line still is dominated by
casuals, including camp or boat mocassins, hikers, and buckskins in
saddle oxfords and ankle boots. _
   The makers of Bostonians, shoes for men, have drawn a sharp
marketing bead on their potential customers with their new lines.
The man who will buy from their American Handsewn line is 28 to 54
years old, prefers classic styles, needs shoes for business, casual
and social occasions, and prizes comfort and durability. The
Italian Handsewn line is aimed at the 28- to 45-year-old man, who
they see as having ``significant spending power,'' likes designer
clothing and lightweight shoes. The customer for Florentines is 28
to 45 and is ``dynamic, successful and image conscious,'' and likes
both classic and contemporary fashions and light, stylish footwear.
The man who picks Continental Classics is younger _ 30 to 45 _ is
in the executive mold and will hold significant spending power
``but perhaps not quite yet.'' He likes stylish footwear and
clothing. _

   If you associate leather clothing with stiff jackets or coats
for winter wear, you may be in for a surprise.
   Leather and suede have been transformed into soft and swingy
sarong skirts, dresses, walking shorts and even jeans, all in
brilliant colors, that can be worn year round. These clothes are in
the spring lines of G-III, the country's largest leather clothing
maker, and have gold buttons, quilted linings, and silk screened
Indian prints to help make them into wearables for all seasons and
occasions.
   Some tips on caring for leather fashions are offered by Morris
Goldfarb, the company's president:
   _ Store them in cloth covers, such as old sheets. This will help
the skins ``breathe.'' Never use plastic.
   _ Use brown paper for pressing. Switch the iron to its lowest
setting, and don't use steam. Move the iron quickly to avoid
overheating, which can discolor or damage the skin.
   _ Don't clean frequently, and never dry clean. This dries out
the natural oils. Us a damp cloth with mild soap. Clean suede once
a year if needed, and use professional cleaners.

   They are, well, the very pearls of your jewelry collection.
   Pearls look right with both daytine and evening wear, points out
Marilu Klar, director of the jewelry department of Gump's stores,
based in San Francisco. And since this is investment jewelry,
you'll want to know some basics about them before buying.
   Ms. Klar advises checking lustre, uniformity, surface smoothness
and color. Fine pearls, she says, are lustrous with light
reflecting in soft glints of pink and blue. Avoid dull looking
pearls with yellow or greenish colors. Make sure the pearls in any
single piece are compatibly shaped and sized. And the surfaces
should always be smooth, without pit marks or cracks. Then pick the
color that suits you _ iridescent pink and blue, pinkish rose,
cream, pure white, blue ranging from pale to dove gray, and black,
which ranges from gray to black with overtones of red, blue, green
or brown.
   Select a color that works well with your skin color, Ms. Klar
says. She notes that European women usually prefer iridescents,
Americans and Japanese like rose, and Middle Eastern and South
American women prefer cream.
   Pearls should be strung on silk thread knotted between each
pearl. Have them re-strung when the thread becomes stretched or
soiled.
   Other maintenance includes avoiding contact with perfumes and
makeup, since these may damage the surface of the pearl, which is
organic. Clean in a mild solution of unscented soap and water, or
even safer, baking soda and water. Rinse thoroughly. Never use
ammonia or harsh commercial detergents.

   A classic apparently enjoying renewed popularity is the
mechanical watch.
   Tourneau, a high-end New York City watch and jewelry dealer,
reports that its 1989 sales of classic and vintage timepieces
increased 60 percent over the previous year. Sales of new watches
that look old are up, too.
   The pick of the store's old-line stock includes two almost
matching Hamilton Ventura models, with abstract triangular faces,
which date back to l959. Or a Lucien Piccard ``skeleton watch''
with a see-through case top, also dating from the l950s. And
classic pre-owned Rolexes.
   Anthony D'Ambrosio, a Tourneau vice president, advises
collectors to look for three things in selecting this type of
timepiece: limited availability, distinctive style, and quality in
condition and make.
   One of the ramifications of this trend is the shortage of
old-time watchmakers in Switzerland, where most classic watches are
made, to meet the demand. There's also a shortage of those who can
repair them. _
   Whether you call it a bag, pocketbook, or purse, it's one of
your most visible accessories.
   Of course, you might call it a minaudiere if you're devoted to
the miniature jeweled creations of Judith Leiber. One of her new
designs is a whimsical bag that looks like a cache of silver coins
tied up in a handkerchief, called ``The Money Bag.'' Another is in
the shape of a ladybug, covered with a floral pattern of
rhinestones and cabochon-cut carnelians. _
   Ancient mosaic designs inspired Roxanne Assoulin for her newest
collection of jewelry for Savannah. Her 18-karat gold rings,
earrings, bracelets and necklaces, studded with precious and
semi-precious stones, echo the geometrics and brilliance of
mosaics, which began in prehistory and reached their apogee during
the Byzantine Empire. The designs make liberal use of triangles,
squares, octagons and lozenges, set with various combinations of
diamonds, sapphires, rubies, pink and green tourmalines, amethysts
and citrines. _
   Sunglasses _ primarily intended to protect eyes and prevent
squinting _ have another life as a fashion accessory.
   Donna Karan's line for Bausch &amp; Lomb, DKNY Eyes, are in tune
with the designer's clothing lines, reflecting classic and offbeat
styles: shields, glacier goggles and small round spectacles. B&amp;L's
Ray-Ban series features classic aviators in many interpretations,
and its Levi's I's are aimed at the blue jean set, with funky
shapes and vividly colored frames inspired by the industrial safety
glasses of the l940s and l950s. All B&amp;L glasses give ultraviolet
protection and have impact- and scratch-resistant lenses.
   For vicarious military cachet, there are Swiss Army Brand
Sunglasses from Forschner, the same company that markets Swiss Army
Knives. These lightweight mirrored glasses are made from
nickel-silver alloy frames and have polycarbonate lenses which
block ultraviolet rays. The glasses are designed for individual fit
and are finished with leather bridge and temple covers, detachable
leather lanyards and leather weather shields. _
   Jewelry for spring will match the soft and easy approach of
clothing, according the the Jewelers' Circular-Keystone, the
leading trade magazine of the retail jewelry industry. There will
be the rich patina of matte-textured gold, warm-colored gemstones
such as citrine, peridot and tourmaline, and ``simple elegant
shapes that fold like fabric, swing like chandeliers and curve like
the human form.'' The magazine's picks of the season include
princess-cut diamonds; citrines and peridots; multiple bracelets;
stack rings; two-tone golds or golds and silvers; open rope-like
links; exotic animals, shells and flowers; knots, wraps and folded
metals; drop earrings; bracelet watches; and long, swingy pendants.

   Why perm your whole head of hair, when a spot or two will do?
   ``Spot perming simply means perming your hair in a designated
area to enhance your hairstyle. You may achieve curl, wave,
fullness, texture or support,'' says Charles Nicholas, New York
City hairstylist and spokesman for Lilt Foam home permanents.
   Nicholas advises combining various sizes of rods to blend the
permanented spot with the other hair. For example, if you want curl
on the top front of your head, use small rods right at the
hairline, then use a medium rod on either side. ``To help in the
size selection of your perm rods, choose large rods for body,
medium rods for waves, and small rods for curls,'' he says.
   Spot perms can be used to give lift to the top of short
hairstyles, to add fullness to any style, or to support long hair,
according to Nicholas. _
   A new kind of nail enamel that can be applied pen-style from a
cartridge has been introduced by Quintessence. Called Nouvage, the
enamel comes in an unbreakable barrel which releases color through
a contoured brush when you press a button on the barrel. This
eliminates the bottle-to-brush-to-nails routine. The
tamper-resistant barrel is sealed so that the enamel won't thicken
or dry out. The line comes in 32 colors, including creams and
pearls. _
   When blow-drying your hair, you can help lock in the wave or
curl by switching to cool air for a few moments. A new blow dryer
from Vidal Sassoon, the Cold Shot Turbo Dryer (VS-214), has a cold
air setting along with two other heat settings, two speeds, a
removable lint filter, coil cord, hanging ring and concentrator
nozzle. The Sassoon line also includes a European-style diffuser
attachment (VS-622) which fits on most blow dryers to style hair
without frizziness _ especially good for naturally curly, permed or
fine hair. _
   Miroir Brot, the luxury makeup mirror from Paris often found in
upscale hotels at home and abroad, is being marketed to consumers
in this country by The French Reflection. The Brot mirror typically
has triple-magnification and a built-in, anti-fogging light. They
are optically ground for mimimum distortion and come in several
magnifications and a variety of styles. Prices range from $250 for
a single lighted table mirror to $8,400 for triple barber mirrors
on a gold tripod base. The mirrors were originated in the l930s by
the House of Brot, one of Europe's leading glassmakers. _
   Travelers to New York can take advantage of the new health club
just opened at Hotel Inter-Continental, which includes an exercise
room, Finnish sauna and steam rooms, massage, fitness counseling
and other services. The hotel is offering `'Good Health'' weekend
and meeting packages for individual travelers or business groups. _
   ``The bob is back with a distinction all its own,'' says Gordon
Nelson, a vice president of Regis Corporation, which operates
salons across the country. ``It's layered through the sides, has
fringed bangs and softer edges to create a unique, timeless look.''
   He adds that this style is the easiest to maintain during summer
months. With a good bob cut, you should be able to just shampoo,
add a conditioner and styling gel or foam, and brush. This type of
cut also is the answer if you're working your way out of an earlier
hairstyle. ``For those not quite ready for the shorter styles,
one-length hair, just touching the shoulders with wispy fringes, is
a classic alternative.'' _
   A styling consultant for Alberto-Culver concurs that short hair
is fashionable again. ``The new look is a cross between Audrey
Hepburn's famous `gamine' and Petula Clark's signature pixie,''
says Andrewe Collinge, a British salon and owner and stylist. ``The
key is versatility and the ability to change your look on a
moment's notice. That's the beauty of the new length and cut.''

   Workers at an International Paper Co. mill are
awaiting results of an unusual election in which striking union
members voted on a contract offered to their non-union replacements.
   The contract ballots were being sent by certified mail to the
union's Tennessee headquarters today to be counted. Gorden Brehm,
an assistant to the president of the United Paperworkers
International Union, said it could be four months before results
are known.
   Brehm said the vote by UPIU Local 14 is subject to a pool vote
by UPIU members from 19 locations throughout the country. Some of
those locals will not be voting on it until their own local
contract votes are held, he said.
   Maine members of Local 14 and the International Brotherhood of
Firemen and Oilers said in recent days the contract proposal was
likely to be rejected.
   Most of the roughly 1,100 hourly mill employees who would be
affected by the contract were hired as replacement workers during a
sometimes-violent strike that ended in October 1988. The work force
includes about 70 former union members _ labeled ``super-scabs'' by
members _ who crossed the picket lines during the strike.
   ``I think everybody expects the same outcome _ a `no' vote,''
Ronald Roy, a member of Local 14, said before the Sunday vote.
   Roy, who said he was recalled to his old job at IP last week, is
among 137 mill employees who are members of UPIU or the firemen and
oilers union.
   Also eligible to vote were about 750 other members who claim
rights to be rehired.
   IP spokesman Brad Peters called Sunday's vote ``a unique set of
circumstances, to some extent unprecedented.''
   The company began proceedings before the National Labor
Relations Board more than two years ago to decertify the union.
Because the matter is unresolved, the union continues to represent
workers at the mill.
   Local 14 President William Meserve recently described the latest
contract talks as a charade in which the company dictated the terms
and refused to consider proposals by the union.
   In February, IP offered what it described as its best offer: a
package retroactive to last October and providing pay raises
totaling 6 1-2 percent over three years, a company-sponsored
retirement savings plan and an increase in the company contribution
to the health insurance plan.
   The proposed contract would replace an open-ended pact that the
company imposed unilaterally during the strike.

   Futures prices for grains and soybeans were
mostly lower in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Weekend rainfall in U.S. growing areas and a forecast for more
showers were depressing the futures market, analysts said.
   Many traders also said that soybean futures have been overbought
recently, and there was some profit-taking during this morning's
trading. On Friday, the contract for delivery in May surged to
11-week highs.
   One analyst said there has been anxiety among traders over what
economic direction the new president of Brazil and how that might
effect agricultural exports.
   Wheat came under pressure from news that Egypt has postponed a
scheduled purchase of 200,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat.
   In early trading, wheat was 1{ cents to 2} cents lower, with the
contract for delivery in March at $3.82 a bushel; corn was { cent
to 2{ cents lower, with March at $2.42} a bushel; oats were
unchanged to 1 cent lower, with March at $1.46{ a bushel; and
soybeans were 1{ cents to 4 cents lower,with March at $5.84 a

   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, cattle futures were mixed,
while most pork complex prices turned higher after opening lower.
   In early trading, cattle were .15 cent lower to .13 cent higher,

   The government plans to establish a stock
market watchdog agency to deal with insider trading, a finance
ministry official said Monday.
   The planned Bourse commissariat is part of draft legislation
approved recently by the Luxembourg government making insider
trading a criminal offense, said the official, who asked not to be
named.
   The legislation is aimed at bringing Luxembourg in line with
European Community law. It should be approved by Luxembourg's
parliament before the end of June, the official said.
   EC legislation outlawing insider trading was adopted by the 12
member states last year and is due to take effect in the trade bloc
by June 1, 1992. Insider trading is using nonpublic information
about a company's activities to trade in stock markets.

   The stock market moved broadly lower today as
interest rate worries and weakness in foreign stocks weighed on
Wall Street.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was off 3.83 to
2,679.50 at noon on Wall Street.
   Declining issues outpaced advances by about 3 to 2 on the New
York Stock Exchange with 499 up, 765 down and 541 unchanged.
   The NYSE composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
0.52 to 185.66.

Friday.
   The American Stock Exchange's market value index declined 0.42

   Michael Metz of Oppenheimer &amp; Co. attributed some of the selling
this morning to fear that the Federal Reserve will be forced to
tighten its credit policy and push interest rates higher in an
effort to ward off inflation.
   But he said in his view the fears are unwarranted because
economic growth remains sluggish despite an unexpectedly strong
employment report on Friday.
   ``I think these fears are unjustified. I think we definitely
have a slowdown here. Everything points to a very sluggish 1990 and
1991,'' Metz said.

   A union official said Greyhound's
striking drivers have been ``like choirboys'' and did not fire a
gunshot that injured eight passengers on a bus operated by a
replacement driver.
   The shot, fired apparently from an Interstate 95 overpass,
showered passengers on the Jacksonville-to-Daytona Beach run with
glass and other debris Sunday night, said sheriff's spokesman Steve
Weintraub. No arrests were made.
   ``Everybody was hollering, `I'm hit, I'm hit,''' said passenger
Ronald Hill.
   Eight of the 41 passengers were injured, but none of the
injuries appeared life-threatening, authorities said. They were
taken to hospitals, and two people underwent surgery for shrapnel
wounds.
   Michael Rogers of Atlanta, a passenger who was wounded in the
neck and chest, was being treated at St. Luke's Hospital.
   ``I don't think they (Greyhound) should run their lines while
they're having a situation like this going on. Or at least warn the
general public that a situation like that might occur,'' he said.
   A Greyhound bus headed into Hartford, Conn., was hit by gunfire
this morning, Connecticut state police said.
   The shooting occurred on Interstate 84 in Farmington, Conn.,
just west of Hartford, at about 10:45 a.m., said state police
spokesman Adam Berluti.
   One passenger, Dondi Maheux, 22, who was heading to Maine, said
most passengers on the bus were asleep when the shooting occurred.
``I just heard a small pop. It sounded maybe just like a
firecracker going off,'' Maheux said.
   Investigators at the Union Station terminal where the bus
arrived about 11 a.m. were talking to passengers. The bus had what
appeared to be a bullet hole on the driver's side in the baggage
area.
   Greyhound was offering a $25,000 reward for information leading
to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for the Florida
shooting, company Chairman Fred G. Currey said.
   Currey and company President Frank Schmieder traveled today from
Greyhound's Dallas headquarters to Jacksonville, where they visited
the hospitalized passengers and a hotel where uninjured passengers
stayed overnight, company spokesman George Gravley said.
   This morning, the two executives also were in the terminal
talking to passengers and planned to ride buses today from
Jacksonville to Miami and Orlando, Gravley said.
   The shooting came on the eve of a meeting called in Washington
by federal mediators with officials of the striking Amalgamated
Council of Greyhound Local Unions in a bid to end the strike.
   The union, which represents 6,300 drivers and more than 3,000
office and maintenance workers, went on strike March 2. There have
been scattered violent incidents since, including a striker crushed
to death by a bus operated by a replacement driver in Redding,
Calif., and shots fired at buses in Chicago and Phoenix.
   Asked if Sunday night's shooting was strike-related, Weintraub
said, ``I think it is.''
   But Bill Nicholson, an executive board member of the
Jacksonville local of the Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local
Unions, said, ``As far as I'm concerned it wasn't one of our
strikers.''
   ``They've been like choirboys,'' he said.
   In Dallas, union spokesman Jeffrey Nelson echoed that view. ``We
believe it's important for the public to understand that this is a
strike against the company, not against the traveling public,''
Nelson said.
   The bus was on a highway about 10 miles south of downtown
Jacksonville when it was hit, Weintraub said. A newly hired
replacement driver was at the wheel, Greyhound said.
   ``I yelled for everybody to get down, and I told the bus driver
to put his accelerator pedal to the floor,'' said passenger Kevin
Covington.
   The unidentified bus driver pulled the bus in safely at a
convenience store about two miles away. The store's night manager,
Roger Ennis, said passengers covered in blood ran in and told him
to call 911.
   Earlier Sunday, Greyhound announced it has restored bus service
to an additional 120 communities that lost regular runs when the
strike began.
   Company spokeswoman Elizabeth Hale said Greyhound added routes
Sunday in parts of the Southeast and Southwest after a new class of
drivers graduated from training courses. But she said she didn't
know how many of the 9,500 communities served before the strike
were being served as of Sunday night.
   On Saturday, Greyhound carried 38 percent of the number of
passengers it did on the same Saturday a year ago and operated
one-third of the number of departing buses, Ms. Hale said. Figures
for Sunday would reflect the larger number of routes but were
unavailable until today, she said.
   Greyhound has been able to serve big cities virtually without
interruption since the strike began, with Sunday's additions
including smaller cities and towns, Ms. Hale said.

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's largest automaker,
said today that it plans to build a huge proving ground northwest
of Phoenix, Ariz., to help develop cars and trucks mainly for the
U.S. market.
   The company's California-based U.S. marketing arm, Toyota Motor
Sales said in a news release it had filed papers for permission to
build the complex about 45 miles northwest of Phoenix.
   Chrysler Corp. currently operates a proving ground near
Wickenburg, Ariz.
   Construction is to begin next year with the complex becoming
operational in 1993 if land purchases and permit applications
proceed as expected, said company spokeswoman Deborah Sanchez Fair.
   The complex will cover about 12,000 acres, include a 10-mile,
high-speed oval, other shorter tracks with a variety of road
conditions, and an airstrip for flying in cars and trucks to be
tested, she said.
   ``Vehicle evaluation is the primary focus, especially
hot-weather conditions,'' she said. ``Chiefly we'll be testing
products for the U.S. market, but it will not be limited to that.''
   The spokeswoman declined to estimate how much the complex will
cost. In Monday's editions, The New York Times quoted an
unidentified automotive executive as saying it would be about $20
million.
   Many automakers have tracks in the Southwest to test vehicles in
hot, dry conditions, and Toyota's will be among the largest.
Chrysler's Arizona proving ground covers about 3,800 acres.

   ``We are on strike. We're making a little noise but we're

operations in Ontario, Upland and Chino.
   Lockheed spokesman John Daily said the walkout by about 1,000
machinists out of a work force of 2,500 was having ``minimal
impact'' on the Ontario-based subsidiary of Lockheed Corp.
   No new talks were scheduled on the dispute over wages and health
benefits. The union members have been working without a contract

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration today signaled an
unexpected willingness to look at a plan by the Democratic chairman
of the House Ways and Means Committee that includes new taxes and a
Social Security freeze.
   ``We think there's some room to talk,'' White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said of the plan unveiled by Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill., over the weekend.
   Rostenkowski's deficit-reduction proposal combines a series of
tax increases and spending cuts with a one-year hold on benefit
increases for the nation's 39 million Social Security recipients.
   President Bush has long voiced opposition to any form of tax
increase and has strongly criticized previous Democratic proposals
to modify the Social Security formula.
   Today's statement does not represent a retreat from those
positions or a major change in administration thinking, Fitzwater
said. He said the Rostenkowski package has ``significant
weaknesses.''
   But at the same time, Fitzwater called Rostenkowski's proposal
``thoughtful'' and said, ``his plan deserves some credit.''
   ``We don't want to pour cold water on a plan we may want to swim
around in for a while,'' the spokesman said.
   Fitzwater said the Rostenkowski package ``comes up with
signicant savings that should be discussed.''
   Rostenkowski said Sunday that a one-year freeze in Social
Security benefits and other entitlement programs could cut the
government's deficit by $9 billion in 1991.
   He said the savings would total nearly $46 billion over the next
five years because the one-year freeze would hold down the base on
which subsequent increases are calculated.'
   His plan also calls for higher taxes on cigarettes and alcohol,
extending the 33-percent tax bracket to the country's highest
income earners and doing away with the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law.
   On the issue of taxes, Fitzwater said: ``Our general attitude
is, the less taxation the better.''
   Told this seemed to be a retreat from Bush's no-new-taxes
proclamations of the past, Fitzwater said: ``I'm not signaling any
action on our part except to say this gives us a basis for
discussion.''
   He said he did not want to go over the Rostenkowski plan
item-by-item at this time. ``Once you get into specifics, we're
going to be negative,'' he said.
   ``If we're all going to share in the responsibility of bringing
our deficit down ... I think we've all got to share in it,''
Rostenkowski said on CBS' ``Face the Nation'' program.
   He said a 1991 freeze in Social Security benefits and other
government programs coupled with new taxes on cigarettes, alcohol,
gasoline and the wealthy could reduce the deficit by more than a
half-trillion dollars over the next five years and produce a
balanced budget by 1994.
   In fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1, Rostenkowski said, his
total package would cut the deficit from the $161 billion as
projected by the Congressional Budget Office to $106 billion.
   The next year, he said, the deficit would fall to $39 billion
under his proposal, instead of $124 billion as projected by the CBO.
   Rostenkowski said he expected a verbal hazing from both
Democrats and Republicans for suggesting a freeze in politically
sensitive Social Security benefits. ``But somebody has to start
saying it,'' he said.
   ``In the silence of the chambers of the House of Representatives
and even in the Senate, members will say that these things should
be done,'' he said. ``I hope I'm laying the blueprint for the
future. All you've got to do is talk straight to the American
people, and they'll respond.''
   Rostenkowski suggested the package as an alternative to Bush's
proposed capital gains tax cut and counterproposals by Democrats to
cut Social Security taxes or restore tax breaks for individual
savings and retirement accounts.
   Bush's fiscal 1991 budget and the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction
law call for a balanced budget in fiscal 1993. But the CBO says
administration budget-writers adopted unrealistically rosy economic
assumptions.
   The Gramm-Rudman law, meanwhile, is almost certain to be
revamped again this year. Rostenkowski said Gramm-Rudman should be
abolished.
   In addition to the spending freeze and new consumer taxes,
Rostenkowski would earmark the entire ``peace dividend'' from an
annual 3 percent cut in defense spending before inflation
adjustments for deficit reduction. He estimated the savings from
that at $150 billion over five years.
   Rostenkowski also would freeze for one-year inflation
adjustments in the tax code, including the indexing of personal
exemptions and brackets but excluding the earned income tax credit
for low-income families.
   ``The impact on individual taxpayers would be modest,'' he said,
``but the aggregate revenue gain would be substantial _ $50 billion
over five years.''
   Eliminated entirely under his proposal would be the ``bubble''
that enables individuals with incomes above $109,100 and families
with incomes over $185,730 to pay an effective tax rate of 28
percent on each additional dollar received. It would raise $44
billion over five years.
   Individuals now making between $47,050 and $109,100 and families
with incomes between $78,400 and $185,730 now pay an effective tax
rate of 33 percent on their marginal income. Rostenkowski's plan
would extend the 33 percent rate to incomes above those amounts.
   Rostenkowski did not specify how much he would raise gasoline,
tobacco and alcohol taxes, other than to say they could provide a
total of $100 billion in new revenues for the government over the
next five years.
   But he said on the CBS program that he envisioned the federal
tax on gasoline rising from the current 9 cents a gallon to 20
cents or 25 cents. A federal gasoline tax of 50 cents a gallon
would never pass Congress, he said.

<HEAD>Argentine State Airline, Phone Company Edge Closer to Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government put a value of
$623 million on Aerolineas Argentinas, the state-owned carrier it
plans to sell this year, newspapers reported Monday.
   In a separate development, the government-owned telephone
company Entel, which also is to be sold, was valued at around $1.9
billion.
   Eighty-five percent of Aerolineas Argentinas will be offered for
$529 million, of which at least $220 million must be paid in cash.
The rest could come from debt-equity swaps, the financial daily El
Cronista Comercial reported. The newspaper cited government data
disclosed over the weekend.
   The airline currently owes $741 million to foreign banks and
financial institutions, plus $127 million in interest that was
overdue last Dec. 31.
   Bids are to be opened April 30 and the winner announced in late
June.
   Of the remaining 15 percent of the airline, the government would
keep 5 percent, leaving 10 percent to be purchased by employees.
   Entel Director Maria Julia Alsogaray recently told Congress that
a value of slightly more than $1 billion has been put on the 60
percent of the telephone company that is for sale.
   A minimum $214 million must be paid in cash for Entel, and the
remainder could be covered by debt-equity swaps, according to
another financial daily, Ambito Comercial.
   The Public Works Ministry said last month that companies that
have expressed interest in Entel include Midland Bank PLC of
Britain, Societa Finanziaria Telefonica of Italy, and Nynex Corp.,
the phone company covering New York state and New England.
   The winner of the bid is scheduled to be announced in late June,
with the sale expected to be completed in early October.
   Some details of both privatizations were still unclear,
including how much, if anything, the buyers would be required to
invest and whether there would be restrictions, such as a ban on
immediate resale or a limitation on foreign ownership.
   The Peronist Party government of President Carlos Menem has
pledged to sell government companies to attract foreign investment
and technology, and to reduce operating losses. For decades,
Argentina has printed currency to cover the losses, fueling
inflation.
   The proposed sales are opposed by labor unions and nationalists
who maintain the government should own the airline, railroad,
electricity and other companies, and by political groups that claim
the government is selling them for too little money.
   Leopoldo Moreau, leader of the opposition Civic Radical Union,
called the proposed sale of Entel ``a rock-bottom price for one of
the few state-owned companies that can attract genuine investment.''
   The Radical government of Raul Alfonsin, in power from December
1983 through last July, tried to sell Aerolineas Argentinas and
Entel in late 1988, and was blocked by Congress, which was
dominated by the Peronist Party then as it is now.
   Under Alfonsin, 40 percent of the airline would have been sold
to Scandanavian Airlines System for $204 million, and 40 percent of
Entel would have been sold to Spain's telephone company,
Telefonica, for a reported $1 billion.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lotus Development Corp. continued its
diversification drive Monday with the announcement of versions of
its popular 1-2-3 spreadsheet program for Digital Equipment Corp.
computers.
   Last month, Lotus released a version of 1-2-3 for mainframe
computers made by International Business Machines Corp. In January,
it said it would make a version for the engineering workstation
computers made by Sun Microsystems Inc.
   The orginal version of 1-2-3 was designed for IBM personal
computers or IBM-compatible PCs. It has become the most popular
spreadsheet program for these desktop machines, but industry
analysts say Cambridge, Mass.-based Lotus needs to expand out of
this market to keep growing.
   Spreadsheets display rows and columns of figures or bar graphs
and are used to represent such things as a company's financial
results. They are among the more popular type of computer programs.
   The new versions of 1-2-3 for Digital computers are the result
of a joint development and marketing agreement signed by Lotus and
Digital in 1988. Digital, based in Maynard, Mass., is the world's
second-largest computer company after IBM.
   Digital officials said the pact allows them to offer an
extremely popular software product to their customers while at the
same time providing a new revenue source.
   With the new software, groups of Digital computer users in
different offices or even different countries could work jointly on
the same spreadsheet, said Gene Hodges, an executive with company.
   The software links computers ranging from desktop workstations
to mainframes, and allows users of 1-2-3 on IBM-based personal
computers to hook up to a Digital-based system.
   ``This lets people work in teams more effectively,'' Hodges said
in an interview.
   Neither Lotus nor Digital released sales projections for the new
software, which is Lotus' first for Digital computers. The
companies also would not disclose how they will split the revenue.
   Lotus also is working on a version of 1-2-3 for Apple Computer
Inc. machines, the company says.

<HEAD>National Semiconductor Cuts Quarterly Loss to $10 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National Semiconductor Corp., hit by
a slowdown in sales and low prices for certain computer chips, on
Monday reported a loss of $10.2 million in the third quarter of its
fiscal year.
   The loss was an improvement on the $44.6 million the company
lost in the same period a year ago.
   Sales for the quarter ended Feb. 25 totaled $404.3 million, up
from $379.3 million a year earlier.
   For the nine months ended Feb. 25, the company reported a net
loss of $29.7 million, or 36 cents per share, on sales of $1.22
billion, compared with a net loss of $100.3 million, or $1.04 per
share, on sales of $1.23 billion for the year-earlier period.
   Charles E. Sporck, National Semiconductor's president and chief
executive officer, said the most recent loss was expected.
   ``The third quarter is historically a challenging one for us,
incorporating a seasonal slowdown in sales, along with the annual
holiday shutdown of our production facilities,'' Sporck said. ``In
addition, our performance was affected by continued pricing
pressure in certain product areas.''
   The products most affected by lower prices were EPROMS _
electrical programmable read only memories _ widely used in data
processing.
   Sporck said bookings of orders were stronger late in the third
quarter and he expects the company to post a profit in the fourth
quarter.

   Overnight in Tokyo, the 225-share Nikkei index dropped 624.89
points, or 1.84 percent, to close at 33,368.23.
   The government reported Monday that British retail sales rose
2.4 percent in February, compared with a 1 percent drop in January.
Analysts had expected a 0.4 percent rise for February.
   ``Stocks held up unreasonably well,'' one market maker said.
``The only saving grace was that there was no outright selling
pressure.''

   The stock market was mixed in afternoon trading
today as the blue chips recouped earlier losses.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which drifted at
lower levels in morning trading, rose 2.71 to 2,686.04 at 2 p.m. on
Wall Street.
   Declining issues held a dwindling lead over advances of less
than 6 to 5 on the New York Stock Exchange with 626 up, 746 down
and 518 unchanged.
   The NYSE composite index of all its listed common stocks stood
at 186.14, off 0.04.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board amounted to 81.71 million
shares with two hours left to go in the session.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 0.14
to 361.29.
   The market continued to be dogged by interest rate worries.
   Michael Metz of Oppenheimer &amp; Co. cited fears that the Federal
Reserve will be forced to tighten its credit policy and push
interest rates higher in an effort to ward off inflation.
   But he said in his view the fears are unwarranted because
economic growth remains sluggish despite an unexpectedly strong
employment report on Friday.
   ``I think these fears are unjustified. I think we definitely
have a slowdown here. Everything points to a very sluggish 1990 and
1991,'' Metz said.
   Strength in the dollar and weakness in Tokyo's stock market also
weighed down Wall Street.
   The dollar reached a 2{-year high against the Japanese yen today
in Tokyo trading, closing at 152 yen. It was the U.S. currency's
highest close in Tokyo since Aug. 14, 1987, when it finished at
152.40 yen.
   In Tokyo, the 225-share Nikkei index, which rose 302.23 points
Friday, dropped 624.89 points, or 1.84 percent, today to close at
33,368.23.
   Rorer surged 3{ to 66&rsqb; on news that the French chemical company
Rhone-Poulenc SA has signed a definitive agreement to merge its
pharmaceutical business with Rorer. It ranked second on the Big

   H.J. Heinz Co. said Monday its third-quarter
profit rose 13.7 percent as its sales rose nearly 3 percent.
   For the quarter ended Jan. 31, the food maker reported net
income of $117.1 million, or 44 cents a share, up from $103
million, or 39 cents a share in the year-ago period.
   Sales edged up to $1.41 billion from $1.37 billion in the same
quarter a year ago. Higher sales came from acquisitions, price
increases and volume, the company said.
   The sales increase was partially reduced by unfavorable exchange
rates for some foreign sales, particularly in the United Kingdom
and Venezuela, Heinz said.
   ``We are encouraged by the year-to-date performance and are
optimistic that we will achieve a level of full year growth which
is consistent with our historical trend,'' said Heinz Chairman
Anthony J.F. O'Reilly.
   The earnings per share figures for the two periods reflect a
two-for-one stock split in the form of a distribution of shares
effective Sept. 27.
   For the first nine months of the year, Heinz earned $369
million, or $1.39 per share, up 14.2 percent from $323 million, or
$1.23 per share.
   Sales for the first nine months of the year increased 5.3
percent to $4.39 billion from $4.17 billion mostly because of
growth in the company's core products, including ketchup, Ore-Ida
Potatoes and Weight Watchers' products and services.

   Futures prices for soybeans were lower and grains
were mixed at the close Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Corn rallied after opening lower on news of Friday's
disappointing U.S. Agriculture Department supply-demand report,
said Susan Leighty, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   She said corn has been supported by good feed demand for hogs
and good export demand, especially from Asian countries.
   But weekend rainfall in U.S. growing areas and a forecast for
more showers were depressing the futures market, said Mickey Luth,
an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   He said there also has been anxiety among traders over the
economic direction the new president of Brazil will take in that
important agriculture-exporting country.
   At the close, wheat was 1} cents to 4\ cents lower, with the

   The European Community decided Monday
to boost its aid to Eastern Europe but cut in half proposed
increases for other developing countries.
   The EC's economics and finance ministers agreed on increasing
the EC budget over the next three years by 300 million European
currency units, or $357 million, to 500 million ECUs, or $595
million, for the benefit of Eastern European countries.
   The ministers also approved budgeting 820 million ECUs, or $976
million, in 1991 and 970 million ECUs, or $1.1 billion, in 1992 to
the Eastern European countries. The European Commission had
proposed slightly higher amounts.
   But the ministers slashed proposals by the Commission to boost
aid to Mediterranean, Latin American, Asian and African countries.
   They approved increases in the EC budget for those countries of
310 million ECUs, or $369 million, for 1991 and 570 million ECUs,
or $678 million , for 1992, well below the 800 million and 1

   The revisions must be approved by the European Parliament before
they can be formally written into the EC budget.

<HEAD>Pharmaceutical Companies Announce Agreement On Merger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE RULE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FORT WASHINGTON, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rorer Group Inc. and France's
Rhone-Poulenc SA have signed a $1.7 billion agreement to create one
of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies, the companies
jointly announced Monday.
   The agreement would combine the surbuban Philadelphia-based
Rorer with the Paris-based Rhone-Poulenc's human pharmaceutical
operations in a new firm called Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc.
   The merger is the latest example of consolidation in the drug
industry and is aimed at lowering research costs and gaining global
markets.
   Last year, SmithKline Beckman Corp. of Philadelphia merged with
Britain's Beecham Group PLC to form SmithKline Beecham, and
Bristol-Myers Co. of New York acquired Squibb Corp. of Princeton,
N.J. to form Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.
   The latest transaction will encompass several stages, with
Rhone-Poulenc initially offering $78 per share for 50.1 percent of
Rorer's 21.6 million shares, a cost of about $842 million.
   A tender offer at that price values the entire company at $1.685
billion.
   Following the tender offer Rhone-Poulenc will transfer its
pharmaceuticals business and issue contingent value rights to
Rorer, with the number corresponding to non-tendered Rorer shares.
   In exchange, Rorer will take on $265 million of Rhone-Poulenc
debt and acquire the French group's existing U.S. pharmaceutical
subsidiary for $20 million.
   Rorer also will create 24 million new shares, giving
Rhone-Poulenc 68 percent of Rorer's share capital comprising some
67.3 million shares.
   Rhone-Poulenc expects to acquire the 68 percent of Rorer by June
1990.
   The tender offer will begin Friday, Rhone-Poulenc said. The
companies had announced their intentions to merge earlier this year.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Rorer was the most
active issue, rising $3 a share to $65.87{ on volume of nearly 2.3
million shares.
   The agreement does not include other portions of the French
company's healh business, such as serums and vaccines, veterinary
medicines, animal nutrition and Rhone-Poulenc's interest in Roussel
Uclaf SA.
   ``Through Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, we will achieve our mission of
becoming a top 10 research-based pharmaceutical company,'' said
Robert E. Cawthorn, chairman, president, and chief executive
officer of Rorer. Cawthorn has been named to the same positions in
the new company, which will be based in Fort Washington.
   The company expects to have annual sales exceeding $3 billion,
he said.
   The human pharmaceutical business of Rhone-Poulenc had sales of
$1.9 billion in 1989, while Rorer had $1.2 billion, the companies
said.
   Analyst Ron Nordmann of PaineWebber Group Inc. said it is too
early to make any judgments on the new company.
   ``In terms of the details, the company's potential earning power
is still up in the air,'' he said. ``We need to get more numbers on
the company before we are able to do any earnings assessment.''
   Rorer is best known for its Maalox antacid. Rhone-Poulenc is in
the top 10 in the European pharmaceutical market but has no direct
marketing in the United States or Japan.
   ``That French company has no presence in the U.S., then
overnight, they are in,'' said analyst Michael Martorelli of Janney
Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia. ``And Rorer gets the French
company's drugs and adds somebody else's research to it own.''
   He said the merger kills any takeover rumors swirling around
Rorer.
   ``Now, with a large partner, they'll no longer be subject to the
rumors,'' he said. ``Management can stop worrying about that. It
seemed like everytime they turned around there was another takeover
rumor or question.''

   The stock market drifted to a modestly higher

<HEAD>AT&amp;T To Share Key Semiconductor Ingredient Under Sematech</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AT&amp;T signed an agreement Monday to share a key
ingredient used to make advanced semiconductors under the auspices
of Sematech, the consortium of computer chip makers formed to boost
U.S. semiconductor competitiveness.
   Under the agreement, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. will
allow a division of Olin Corp. to make and sell a chemical used to
etch extremely detailed electronic circuitry on chips.
   The chemical, called ``deep UV resist,'' allows chip designers
to pack a greater number of circuits on chips than current
technologies.
   In making chips, circuitry is etched on silicon wafers using a
light-sensitive chemical, or resist, and a ``mask,'' whose function
is similar to that of a negative in photography.
   AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories has invented a version of the chemical
that is used with ultraviolet light instead of the visible light
currently used.
   However, Olin will not be the first company to market
ultraviolet-based resist. Shipley Co. Inc. of Newton, Mass., has
been selling ultraviolet resist for several years, and it is being
used by chip makers to test the new technology, said Eric Alling, a
marketing manager for the company.
   ``We're very encouraged AT&amp;T has elected to expand the viabilty
of deep UV technology,'' Alling said.
   The UV resist can produce highly complex computer chips with
circuits as thin as 0.3 micrometers, or about 400 times smaller
than a human hair, AT&amp;T said.
   ``Such dimensions are essential for packing more processing
power, speed and memory into the chips of the future,'' said Arno
Penzias, vice president of research for Bell Labs.
   Circuitry on most chips today is 1 to 1.2 microns wide, while it
reaches 0.8 microns in more advanced chips.
   AT&amp;T said it also is working on two other advanced technologies
for making even more complex computer chips: X-ray lithography and
electron-beam techniques.
   Japanese chip makers are believed to be concentrating on
ultraviolet lithography as the next generation of technology, while
also studying the X-ray technique. European makers are actively
exploring X-rays, industry analysts said.
   ``Perhaps what this may indicate is that the use of X-ray
techniques may be further down the road than the Japanese
thought,'' analyst Jay Ritter of Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. in Chicago said
of the AT&amp;T pact.
   Adopting either technique would require an enormous investment
in new chip manufacturing equipment, but the X-ray technology would
be more costly than the ultraviolet technique, said Mark
FitzGerald, an analyst with Dataquest Inc. of San Jose, Calif. The
research firm believes ultraviolet etching will be used for the
next generation of semiconductors.
   Sematech officials hailed the AT&amp;T agreement.
   ``The deep UV resist is the future in semiconductor
manufacturing, and will produce semiconductors that compete in the
global market in terms of performance and price,'' said Robert
Noyce, president and chief executive of the consortium.
   Sematech was founded by 14 U.S. semiconductor manufacturers,
including AT&amp;T, under the sponsorship of the U.S. government, which
splits the cost of the consortium with the companies.

<HEAD>National Intergroup Blasts Liquidation Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National Intergroup Inc. criticized a
dissident investor group's plan to liquidate the company, saying it
is ``sketchy, ill-defined and ill-conceived.''
   The Pittsburgh-based distribution company sent a strongly worded
letter to shareholders over the weekend in response to Centaur
Partners' efforts to induce them to change key parts of the
company's bylaws. All 12 National Intergroup directors signed the
letter.
   Centaur cannot seek control of the board of directors at July's
annual meeting unless shareholders first agree to increase the
board's size to 15. It must get 80 percent of the stockholders to
agree to the change, according to a Delaware court ruling made last
week.
   Centaur is the company's largest stockholder with 16.5 percent
of outstanding shares. It began its efforts to change the bylaws
last week, saying it wanted to elect a new board that would
liquidate the company for the benefit of shareholders.
   The Centaur group, National Intergroup says, ``consists of
takeover artists who have no proven track record in running public
companies.''
   It also attacked Centaur's plan as a scheme to enrich the
group's investment bankers, who stand to make $2.7 million up front
for a three-year contract and the promise of more fees later when
assets are sold.
   Centaur has contended it could fetch $29.34 per share, and
perhaps several dollars more, by selling National Intergroup in
pieces. The company expressed doubt Centaur could get those
proceeds in a ``fire sale.''
   In trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, National
Intergroup rose 25 cents a share to $16.75.
   Centaur is best known for its unsuccessful hostile takeover bid
last year for Pennwalt Corp., a Philadelphia-based chemicals and
pharmaceuticals concern.

   The stock market meandered to a modestly higher

   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which drifted in a
narrow range throughout the session, eked out a gain of 3.38 points
to end at 2,686.71.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by a slim margin of
less than 10 to 9 in nationwide trading of New York Stock
Exchange-listed stocks, with 752 up, 697 down and 514 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board eased to 114.79 million
shares from 150.41 million on Friday. It was the lowest volume
since Dec. 26 when 77.61 million shares changed hands. Previously,
the smallest number of shares traded this year had been 118.39
million on Feb. 12.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 139.74 million shares.
   Strength in the dollar and greater stability in the bond market
after a selloff Friday benefited stocks.
   Interest rate worries, however, continued to be a drag on Wall
Street while many investors stayed on the sidelines awaiting
potentially market-moving economic reports due later this week.
   Michael Metz of Oppenheimer &amp; Co. cited speculation that the
Federal Reserve will be forced to tighten its credit policy and
push interest rates higher in an effort to ward off inflation as a
concern among traders.
   But he said in his view the fears are unfounded because economic
growth remains weak despite an unexpectedly strong employment
report on Friday.
   ``I think these fears are unjustified. I think we definitely
have a slowdown here. Everything points to a very sluggish 1990 and
1991,'' Metz said.
   Among the statistics to be released this week are the February
retail sales report on Tuesday and February reports on wholesale
prices, housing starts and industrial production on Friday.
   Rorer jumped 3 to 65~ on news that the French chemical company
Rhone-Poulenc SA has signed a definitive agreement to merge its
pharmaceutical business with Rorer. It led the Big Board's list of
heavily traded stocks on turnover of more than 2.27 million shares.
   Among the active blue chips, International Business Machines
increased 1\ to 107}, Philip Morris rose } to 38, General Motors
moved ahead by } to 47 and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph added &lsqb;
to 41&lsqb;. One loser among the active blue chips was General Electric,
which ended \ lower at 62&rsqb;.
   Navistar was the second most heavily traded Big Board issue as
nearly 2.1 million shares changed hands. It closed unchanged at 4&rsqb;.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose $5.41 billion, or 0.17
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.33 to 186.51.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index added 0.90 to 391.25, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index finished up 0.74 at 338.67.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell
0.20 to 436.56. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 361.87, up 0.72.

<HEAD>Class Action Suit Filed Against Southeast Food Chain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE SMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Food Lion employee filed a
federal class action lawsuit against the fast-growing supermarket
chain Monday, alleging the company has illegally denied workers
retirement and health benefits.
   Company officials said the benefit plans are administered
according to law and called the suit an attempt by the United Food
and Commercial Workers Union to pressure the company into
recognizing the union. The company is non-union.
   ``The union has a history of creating these lawsuits ... and the
most mileage they get out of it is in media coverage that they have
filed it,'' said Food Lion Inc. spokesman Mike Mozingo in a
telephone interview from the company's Salisbury, N.C.,
headquarters.
   Food Lion has 675 stores in 10 states from Delaware to Florida,
including 81 in South Carolina.
   The lawsuit, filed by former employee Rickey Bryant of West
Columbia, alleges the company used a scheme to terminate employees
to prevent them from receiving full or partial profit-sharing
benefits _ a program which serves as the company's retirement plan.
   In addition, it alleges employees are unlawfully discharged on
the grounds of ``gross misconduct'' so the company does not have to
continue providing health benefits for employees and their families.
   The suit said those who have the most to gain when a non-vested
worker leaves and forfeits profit sharing ``are the longest-serving
and highest-paid employees of the company.''
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Charleston, claims
Bryant's termination in 1988 after nine years with the company was
a pretext to deny him 55 percent of the approximately $67,000 he
had in profit sharing.
   As of December 1987 the profit-sharing plan had 20,907 active
participants and $192 million in assets. But only 81 people were
fully vested and only 2,956 were partially vested, the suit said.
   ``Because of the high turnover rate at Food Lion, there are many
thousands of employees who are or have been participants in the
plan and who will derive no benefit,'' the suit charges.
   Among the damages the lawsuit is seeking from Food Lion are
Bryant's reinstatement and restoration of back pay and lost health
and profit-sharing plan for Bryant and other defendants.
   Nicholas Clark, the assistant general counsel for the United
Food and Commercial Workers International who drafted the lawsuit,
said the union came to Bryant's aid even though Food Lion is a
non-union company.
   He said the class action lawsuit could potentially involve
thousands of former employees and millions of dollars in benefits.
   ``The suit has much more significance than just Food Lion,''
Clark added. He said it could affect any employer with a high
turnover and who structures profit sharing so workers do not get
their benefits.
   Mozingo said he could not comment on the specifics of the
complaint because he had not seen a copy of the lawsuit.
   More than 21,000 of the chain's 42,000 employees are fully or
partially vested in the profit sharing plan. Ten years ago, the
chain _ which is opening over 100 stores annually _ employed only
4,849 workers.
   ``A lot of people working for Food Lion have not been here that
long because we simply didn't have that many stores open,'' Mozingo
said.
   He said the union has tried unsuccessfully to organize the chain
and ``they have not been able to get to first base with our
employees.''
   ``They look at our 40,000 employees and see these people aren't
sending in dues every month,'' Mozingo said. ``They look to
discredit the company and stop our growth.''

Acclaim common stock, was not disclosed.
   MCA, the Universal City-based entertainment company, announced
in January it would sell LJN, which MCA acquired for about $66

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices fell Monday amid concern
over a high OPEC oil production estimate and unseasonably warm
weather in Europe and the eastern United States.
   It was the fifth straight day of declines in the markets for
crude oil, heating oil and gasoline.
   The contract for April delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the
key grade of U.S. crude oil, fell 19 cents to $20.24 a 42-gallon
barrel after declining $1.05 in the previous four trading sessions.
Subsequent contract months fell as much as 32 cents a gallon Monday.
   Andrew Lebow, an energy market analyst with E.D.&amp;F. Man
International Futures Inc., said traders were unsettled by a report
that production by the 13-member Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries may have soared in February.
   The report by the Middle East Economic Survey said that OPEC
production may have hit 24 million barrels a day last month,
800,000 to 1 million barrels higher than estimated by the
International Energy Agency, Lebow said.
   ``The lack of interest in crude is putting a lot of selling
pressure on the market,'' said John Hill of Merrill Lynch Energy
Futures.
   In addition, unseasonably warm temperatures in Europe and the
United States weakened demand for home heating oil, analysts said.
In addition, gasoline futures prices were down because of supply
concerns with a surplus of gasoline in New York harbor.
   The contract for April delivery of home heating oil fell 0.33
cents to 53.86 cents a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
after falling 1.48 cents on Friday. The contract has lost 4.43
cents since last Tuesday. Subsequent contract months also declined
Monday, with May down 0.43 cent.
   The April contract for unleaded regular gasoline fell 0.66 cent
to 54.33 cents a gallon after a 1.15 cent loss on Friday and a drop
of 4.97 cents since last Tuesday. Later contracts declined by up to
0.95 cent a gallon Monday.

<TEXT>
   The dollar rose against most major currencies
Monday, reaching its highest level in 2{ years against the Japanese
yen in Tokyo.
   Gold prices finished unchanged to slightly lower in New York
trading after rising overseas. Republic National Bank of New York
quoted a late bid for gold of $399.25 a troy ounce, down from
$399.75 late Friday. On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for
current delivery settled unchanged at $399.80 a troy ounce.
   The dollar rose despite reported intervention by the Federal
Reserve to sell the U.S. currency to stem its advance.
   Foreign-exchange traders said there was moderate buying of
dollars in the wake of Friday's buoyant U.S. employment figures
which showed more job growth than had been expected.
   ``It was just a slow sort of bid to the dollar,'' said Jeff
Mondschein, manager of foreign exchange at Continental Illinois
National Bank &amp; Trust Co. in Chicago.
   The dollar would have risen more, dealers said, but for anxiety
that the West German central bank would intervene if the exchange
rate rose much above 1.71 marks. The dollar closed at 1.7110 West
German marks in Europe, up from 1.7040 marks late Friday. By the
end of trading in New York, the dollar had edged up to 1.7135 marks
from 1.7025 marks late Friday.
   In Tokyo, where the business days ends as Europe's begins, the
dollar climbed to 152.00 yen, its highest level there since it
reached 152.35 yen on July 22, 1987. In London, the dollar closed
at 152.36 yen, up from 151.32 yen on Friday. In New York trading,
the dollar extended its advance to 152.63 yen, up from 151.27 yen
late Friday.
   The U.S. currency also gained against the British pound. The
pound fell to $1.6100 in London, down from Friday's $1.6183. That
was the pound's lowest close against the dollar since Jan. 3, when
it stood at $1.6080. The pound had traded as high as $1.7145 on
Feb. 22.
   Later, in New York, a pound fetched $1.6115, down from $1.6170
late Friday.
   On Friday, the pound lost nearly 2.5 cents amid anxiety over
recent demonstrations against a new tax imposed by city halls
across Britain. In addition, opinion polls show the popularity of
the Conservative government and of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
is at an all-time low as inflation rises and interest rates remain
high.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday,
included: 1.5258 Swiss francs, up from 1.5095; 5.7915 French
francs, up from 5.7560; 1,265.50 Italian lire, up from 1,257.50;
and 1.1787 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1804.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Friday, included: 1.5235 Swiss francs, up from 1.5115; 5.7800
French francs, up from 5.7615; 1.9190 Dutch guilders, up from
1.9150; 1,263.75 Italian lire, up from 1,258.75; and 1.1787
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1792.
   Gold bullion dealers said trading in Europe was quiet.
   Gold was bid at $400.65 a troy ounce late in London, up from
$399.05 on Friday. The late bid in Zurich, Switzerland, was $401.10
an ounce, up from $399.50.
   Earlier in Hong Kong gold closed at $400.55 an ounce, down from
$400.65.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid of $5.13 a troy
ounce, up from $5.11.
   On New York's Comex, silver for current delivery settled at
$5.042 a troy ounce, down from $5.095 late Friday.

<HEAD>Pork Bellies Limit Up Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIO FOX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Futures prices for frozen pork bellies rose sharply Monday on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for the fourth time in five
sessions. On other markets, grains were mixed, while precious
metals and energy products slid lower.
   ``Bellies are king again,'' said analyst Paul Hare of Linnco
Futures Inc. in Chicago. He attributed the rally to a technical
adjustment following a slump Friday.
   Contracts for delivery of pork bellies in March, May, July and
August rose the daily limit of 2 cents. Frozen pork bellies settled
1.42 cents to 2.00 cents higher, with March at 52.95 cents a pound.
   Friday's decline followed three straight higher sessions.
   Cattle futures were mainly higher, responding to an upward trend
in the cash market, said analyst Phil Stanley of ADM Investor
Services.
   Cattle settled .15 cent lower to .40 cent higher, with the
contract for delivery in April at 78.02 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .05 cent lower to .37 cent higher, with March at 82.47
cents a pound; and live hogs were unchanged to .90 cent higher,
with April at 52.82 cents a pound.
   Futures prices for soybeans were lower and grains mixed at the
close Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Corn rallied after opening lower on news of Friday's
disappointing U.S. Agriculture Department supply-demand report,
said Susan Leighty, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. in New York.
   She said corn has been supported by good feed demand for hogs
and good export demand, especially from Asian countries.
   But weekend rainfall in U.S. growing areas and a forecast for
more showers were depressing the futures market, said Mickey Luth,
an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in Chicago.
   He also said there has been anxiety among traders over the
economic direction that will be taken by the new president of
Brazil, a major agricultural exporter.
   Wheat settled 1\ cents lower to { cent higher, with the contract
for delivery in March at $3.83{ a bushel; corn was 2{ cents to 3}
cents higher, with March at $2.47 a bushel; oats were 1\ cents to 2
cents higher, with March at $1.47\ a bushel; and soybeans were 2}
cents to 5\ cents lower, with March at $5.82} a bushel.
   Energy futures prices slumped on the New York Mercantile
Exchange amid concern over a high OPEC oil production estimate and
unseasonably warm weather in Europe and the eastern United States.
   Andrew Lebow, an energy market analyst with E.D.&amp;F. Man
International Futures Inc., said traders were unsettled by a report
that production by the 13 Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries may have soared in February.
   The report by the Middle East Economic Survey said that OPEC
production may have hit 24 million barrels a day last month,
800,000 to 1 million barrels higher than estimated by the
International Energy Agency, Lebow said.
   Markets for heating oil and gasoline also were lower.
   Crude oil settled 19 cents to 32 cents lower, with the contract
for delivery in April at $20.24 a barrel; heating oil was .12 cent
to .43 cent lower, with April at 53.53 cents a gallon; and unleaded
gasoline was .10 cent to .95 cent lower, with April at 54.33 cents
a gallon.
   Coffee futures recovered from steep declines in early trading on
the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, but still finished
much lower. A brand new contract for delivery in July 1991 dropped
3.37 cents in its first session.
   Traders said they were still nervous over news that Brazil
exporters were asking the government to release its stocks to fill
export demands.
   Coffee settled .60 cent to 3.37 cents lower, with the contract
for delivery in March at 93.25 cents a pound.
   Precious metals futures were mostly lower on New York's
Commodity Exchange. A strengthened U.S. dollar depressed gold,
while silver futures fell under the pressure of increased Comex
warehouse stocks, according to analysts.
   Gold settled 10 cents higher to 50 cents lower, with the
contract for delivery in March at $399.80 a troy ounce. Silver was
5.3 cents to 6 cents lower, with March at $5.04 a troy ounce.

<HEAD>Court Grants Delay in Warner, Schiebel Cases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Ohio Supreme Court on Monday granted a
delay in arguments in the state's appeal from two criminal
convictions stemming from the collapse of Home State Savings Bank.
   The court said oral arguments involving former Home State owner
Marvin Warner and a former president of the thrift, David Schiebel,
will be rescheduled no later than June 6 if the state and the
defendants' lawyers meet a pre-hearing briefing schedule.
   Arguments had been scheduled for March 27, but special
prosecutor Lawrence Kane Jr. of Cincinnati is requesting the delay
pending disposition of some other matters in the case, Attorney
General Anthony J. Celebrezze Jr. said.
   Cincinnati-based Home State collapsed on March 8, 1985, four
days after ESM Government Securities Inc. of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
was declared insolvent. Home State lost $144 million through its
securities transactions with ESM.
   The failure of Home State led to Ohio's savings and loan
industry crisis of that year.
   Warner, Schiebel and another former Home State president, Burton
Bongard, were convicted on March 2, 1987 of state charges related
to Home State's collapse.
   Warner was convicted of nine felonies _ six counts of
misapplying about $14 million in bank money through unauthorized
payments to ESM and three counts of securities violations. He was
acquitted of 76 other counts.
   Schiebel was found guilty of three securities violations, and
Bongard was convicted of 82 counts of misapplication and
unauthorized transfer of funds.
   Warner had been sentenced to 3{ years in prison and fined $22
million, and Schiebel was sentenced to six months. Both are free on
bond pending their appeals.
   Bongard later pleaded guilty to loan violations and received a
4{-year prison sentence. He was released from prison in July 1989
on probation.
   A three-judge panel of the 1st Ohio District Court of Appeals in
Cincinnati overturned the convictions of Warner and Schiebel on
Nov. 15, 1989.
   Last week, Celebrezze defended the costs of the special
prosecutor _ about $5.9 million so far _ by saying he helped the
state recover $135 million it spent to protect depositors and
stablize the Ohio thrift industry in the wake of Home State's
collaspe.

<HEAD>IBM Introduces Imaging System for Banks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   IBM on Monday introduced a computer system for
banks that caputures electronic images of checks and electronically
``reads'' and records their amount.
   The system should greatly reduce the amount of time and money
spent by banks in manually entering into computers the amount of
checks and in storing and collating the checks, International
Business Machines Corp. said.
   IBM also said banks could improve customer service by providing
images of actual checks along with their customers' monthly
statements.
   The system, developed in cooperation with six major banks,
employs imaging scanners that can take an electronic picture of
checks at up to 2,400 checks per minute.
   The system employs ``compression'' technology that reduces the
amount of data that must be stored to capture an image of a check
or other document. Compression technology is needed to allow
existing computer equipment to handle the vast amount of data
needed to store an image, as opposed to storing data such as
figures.
   The equipment can electronically read the amount of money a
check is written for _ either hand printed or typewritten _ in
about half the cases, IBM said. When the equipment is unsure of a
figure, it will display an image of the check on a screen for a
bank employee to verify the figure or manually enter it into the
computer.
   IBM's main competitor in the bank check imaging market is Unisys
Corp., said Nick Allen, an analyst with Gartner Group Inc., a
consulting firm in Stamford, Conn.
   He said the market for the equipment should be promising as
banks work to limit the labor involved in processing checks.
   ``We've only recently reached the processing power capability to
do this kind of thing,'' he said.
   ``Check processing of banks already is a major market for IBM,''
he added. ``What this does is stimulate demand for hardware.''

<HEAD>Nortek Says It Has Settled with SEC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nortek Inc. has reached a settlement
with the Securities and Exchange Commission over a dispute
involving a four-day delay in filing a form with the government
disclosing its investment in another company.
   Nortek said it agreed to a consent decree under which it will
pay $503,000 into a fund to reimburse any Rexham Corp. stockholders
who may have lost money as a result of the delay in notifying the
SEC of its investment.
   The incident occurred more than three years ago.
   Richard J. Harris, Nortek vice president and treasurer, said his
company purchased more than 5 percent of the outstanding shares of
Rexham in 1986.
   The SEC said Nortek delayed by four days filing a form that
detailed the purchase, as is required when a company or individual
buys more than 5 percent of another company.
   Nortek filed an ``untimely, false and misleading'' statement of
its Rexham investment, said Mary McCue of the SEC. Nortek had
purchased 62,000 shares of Rexham stock in 1986 but a form the
company filed with the SEC ``did not disclose properly Nortek's
position and their intent regarding Rexham,'' Ms. McCue said.
   Nortek sold its investments in Rexham of Pineville, N.C., in
1987, Harris said.
   Nortek neither admitted nor denied that it had broken any laws
or regulations as a result of its Rexham investment, he said. It
agreed to the settlement to close the case and avoid further legal
expenses, he said.
   Under the terms of the judgment, filed in federal court Monday,
any Rexham stockholders who sold shares during the four-day period
and who lost money can seek repayment through the fund Nortek is
establishing. Any money that is not claimed will revert to the U.S.
Treasury.
   ``Nortek filed its consent to a proposed judgment in order to
bring an end to the continuous drain on management time and to
avoid incurring additional legal fees,'' said Ralph R. Pappito,
chairman and chief executive officer. ``We are pleased to put this
bit of our history behind us.''
   Harris said he did not know how much in interest will be paid by
Nortek.
   Nortek manufactures and markets residential and commercial
building products and commercial ventilating and air conditioning
systems. Its stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEAD>Report Says Sweeping Reforms Needed in Stock Markets</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators should give new thought to
sweeping changes in U.S. stock markets, including moving trading
from action-packed exchange floors to flickering computer screens,
a congressional report said Monday.
   Specifically, the General Accounting Office, Congress' auditing
and investigative agency, said the Securities and Exchange
Commission should consider a proposal to repeal a New York Stock
Exchange rule requiring trades of most listed stocks to be executed
on the exchange floor.
   A rule that forbids after-hours trading of listed stocks, in
effect forcing such trading to foreign exchanges, also should be
reviewed, the report said.
   Trading rules were eased in 1979 to permit off-floor trading of
newly listed stocks. But, a decade later, most stocks still were
initially listed before 1979. Trades of 89 of the New York Stock
Exchange's 100 most active shares still must be routed through the
exchange floor.
   The GAO, noting the rapid evolution of computer and
communications technology, said it is time for the SEC to
reconsider rules banning most off-floor trading.
   The SEC disagreed, saying its 1979 study of off-floor trading
was complex and that it would not dismantle the floor system until
market participants determine the resulting new system would be
better than the old method.
   Critics contend that the current structure of the market,
including the use of trading floors and ``specialist'' brokers who
make a market in the stock, restricts price competition.
   Supporters of the current system, however, argue that a central
location for trading preserves the benefits of an auction market.
   The SEC agreed that a review of after-hours trading was in order
even though, in 1986, the commission rejected a recommendation from
it staff that the agency ask the New York Stock Exchange to
consider permitting after-hours trading.
   ``As a result ... exchange member brokers and dealers who wish
to trade exchange-listed stocks when U.S. markets are closed must
do so in foreign markets,'' the GAO said.
   The report, dated Monday, was delivered to the Senate Banking
Committee and the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

<HEAD>AT&amp;T Says All Its Consumer Packaging Materials Now Biodegradable</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARSIPPANY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AT&amp;T announced Monday that all of its
newly manufactured telephones and answering machines will be packed
in 100 percent biodegradable material, a move expected to reduce
the company's distribution and waste disposal costs.
   The new packaging, which uses corrugated cardboard in place of
bulkier foam to protect the company's line of small consumer
products, will make its packaged products about one quarter smaller
than their predecessors, said Lee Blitch, AT&amp;T's director of
advertising and packaging.
   He also said the packaging will disintegrate easily in landfills.
   ``We will save on shipping and (waste) hauling costs because
everything will be 25 to 30 percent smaller,'' he said. ``This is
also welcome by retailers, who will be able to stock more of the
smaller products on their shelves.''
   The new packaging standards apply only to AT&amp;T's line of small
consumer products and will not affect such large items as personal
computers, office switchboard systems and other large components,
said AT&amp;T spokeswoman Lynn Newman.
   Last year, the company announced it had eliminated all sources
of chloroflourocarbons, known as CFCs, from its packaging
materials. CFCs, contained in such materials as styrofoam and
aerosol propellants, are blamed for the deterioration of the
earth's protective ozone layer.
   The New York-based company, which reported $36.1 billion in
revenues for 1989, maintains a team of environmental engineers who
work with its Bell Laboratories subsidiary to improve packaging
techniques, eliminate hazardous materials and encourage recycling,
Ms. Newman said.
   The changes were made, she said, because the old foam inserts
that protected cordless and corded telephones and answering
machines were difficult to collapse and did not disintegrate in
landfills.
   She said information on specific cost savings expected would not
be released because the company did not want to give competitors
any hint of the sales performance of their telephone and answering
machine lines.

<HEAD>Japanese Investment in U.S. Real Estate Down 11 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese purchases of U.S. real estate fell
10.7 percent in 1989, with investment shifting from office
buildings to hotels and resort properties, a report Monday said.
   Japanese spent $14.8 billion on U.S. real estate last year,
compared with $16.5 billion in 1988, according to a study by the
real estate accounting firm Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co.
   Purchases of office properties fell about 60 percent to $3.33
billion in 1989 from $8.31 billion the previous year. Investment in
hotel-resort properties rose to $4.16 billion last year from $3.58
billion in 1988, a 16 percent increase.
   Overall, offices remain the favorite target of Japanese
investors, said Jack Barthell, a Leventhal partner. Of the total
$57.7 billion that the firm's computer data base shows as invested
in U.S. real estate, 44 percent is in offices.
   Japanese appear to be backing away from purchases of ``trophy
properties'' such as Rockefeller Center, the study found.
Mitsubishi Estate Co. last year announced it was spending $846
million for a controlling interest in the company that owns
Rockefeller Center, the Manhattan office and cultural complex.
   The study also noted that despite publicity generated by such
purchases, Japanese still own just 2 percent of U.S. commercial
real estate, far less than European investors.
   California was the leading state for the second year in a row,
with 36 percent of the 1989 investment. Forty percent of the
purchases were concentrated in the greater Los Angeles area.
   Hawaii was second and New York third, but interest among
Japanese buyers in properties there appears to be waning.
   ``Most of the attractive properties have already been acquired,
and the cost of acquisitions in Manhattan may cause investors to
divert funds to other markets,'' Barthell said.
   The top three states accounted for 81 percent of the Japanese
investment.
   Among other findings, investment in residential property jumped
to 15 percent, triple the amount invested in 1988. Nearly
two-thirds of that was in California and 28 percent in Hawaii.
   Leventhal said the size of Japanese deals is getting smaller as
investment moves into smaller American cities, and that Japan's
largest institutional investors are turning attention to Europe
leading up to economic unification in 1992.
   Leventhal defines investment as both equity investment and
convertible debt secured by U.S. real estate.

<HEAD>Toyota Plans Huge Proving Ground in Arizona</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Toyota Motor Corp. plans to put desert heat to
work testing the endurance of its cars and trucks, the company said
Monday.
   Toyota, Japan's largest automaker, announced plans for a
12,000-acre proving ground about 45 miles northwest of here. Toyota
will be the seventh company to test vehicles on a private test
track in Arizona, but it will have the largest facility when
construction ends sometime in 1993.
   The largest test track in the state now is the 5,000-acre
General Motors Desert Proving Grounds southeast of Mesa, the
Arizona Economic Council said. Nissan, Chrysler, Ford, Jaguar,
Volvo and Volkswagen also operate proving grounds in Arizona.
   Chrysler's track is near Wickenburg and will be closest to the
Toyota facility, which will be about 16 miles south of Wickenburg.
   Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. Inc., the company's California-based
U.S. marketing arm, said in a news release it had filed papers with
Maricopa County to build the complex.
   Construction is to begin next year with the complex becoming
operational in 1993, if land purchases and permit applications
proceed as expected, said Barbara DeMichele, a spokeswoman for B.J.
Communications of Phoenix.
   The complex will include a 10-mile, high-speed oval where
vehicles will reach speeds of 160 mph, other shorter tracks with a
variety of road conditions, and an airstrip for flying in test cars
and trucks, she said in a prepared statement.
   ``Our requirements call for a site that offers the high
temperature conditions we'll need for testing and at the same time
provide sufficient space and even terrain to allow for course
construction,'' DeMichele said.
   She said the vehicles would be primarily destined for the U.S.
market.
   Toyota chose the site near Wickenburg from among 10 on a list
developed from a national search begun in 1988, said Scott Eubanks
of the economic council.
   Eubanks said the state offered no economic incentives.
   ``We are especially pleased because we were able to attract
Toyota on our merits alone,'' he said.
   Toyota officials declined to estimate the cost of the track or
the land acquisition. The Arizona Republic reported last month that
Toyota would pay $47.6 million for 14,000 acres of land. It
attributed the report to a source close to the negotiations.

<HEAD>Union Accuses Wheeling-Pittsburgh of Stalling Contract Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM STRADER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Steelworkers negotiators on Monday
accused Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. of using pressure tactics
to convince workers currently engaged in collective bargaining to
accept a substandard labor agreement.
   The union also said the company, which for five years has been
under bankruptcy court protection, is stalling contract talks and
U.S. Bankruptcy Court proceedings.
   ``The company's trying to brainwash our members,'' said Andrew
``Lefty'' Palm, chairman of a union committee negotiating with
Wheeling-Pittsburgh.
   In a statement late Monday, Wheeling-Pittsburgh denied the
charges and called on the union to back up its allegations in court
Thursday. The company said its pay offer of more than $5 an hour
over three years is generous.
   The offer includes a $2-an-hour pay raise, a $3,000 signing
bonus and a $4,500 settlement, the company said.
   At an earlier news conference at union headquarters, Palm said
Wheeling-Pittsburgh executives have said they will delay bankruptcy
filings until the union agrees to a new contract.
   ``They have threatened me personally and they have threatened
people on this committee that they ... will not file a
reorganization plan until they get a labor agreement,'' Palm said.
   That action defies a court order, he added.
   Union officials said the company has committed a number of
questionable actions in connection with the negotiations, including
distributing the company's contract proposal at plants and implying
that management might liquidate the company.
   Also, the union said, company officials have talked with union
members one-on-one and in small groups to agitate them and make
them angry at the union's leadership.
   ``They're at them every day,'' Palm said.
   He said the company is unwilling to give workers a fair pay
increase, claiming its financial troubles make it impossible. He
challenged that assertion by presenting figures showing that
Wheeling-Pittsburgh is making a larger operating profit than
another steelmaker in bankruptcy proceedings, LTV Inc.
   The union data show LTV will pay a $1-an-hour average raise
starting next year while Wheeling-Pittsburgh is offering an
increase of only 25 cents an hour.
   Wheeling-Pittsburgh said it and its creditors believe recovery
``would be difficult, if not impossible'' if the union's demands
are met.
   Negotiations with Wheeling-Pittsburgh began in October but broke
down several weeks ago, said union negotiator Jim Bowen. Several
groups of creditors are vying for control of the company once it
comes out of bankruptcy protection but none has emerged as a
leader, which complicates the talks, he said.
   ``It's pretty hard to negotiate with a ghost,'' Bowen said.
   Wheeling-Pittsburgh employs about 5,500 steelworkers at plants
in West Virginia, Ohio and western Pennsylvania.
   Separately Monday, the steelworkers union announced that its
international president, Lynn R. Williams, has asked steel, oil and
gas giant USX Corp. to furnish the union with copies of any
agreement it has reached with financier Carl Icahn.
   Icahn and USX last week announced that Icahn's proposal to spin
off USX's steel division will be voted on at the company's annual
meeting in May. The company said it opposes the idea but will give
``due consideration'' to the outcome of the vote.
   In a statement, Williams said the spin-off proposal ``raises
many questions affecting our members employed by USX, our
collective bargaining relationship and the administration of the
many collective bargaining agreements between USX and our union.''
   Union spokesman Dick Fontana said Williams made his request
Friday, a day after USX and Icahn announced the agreement. Fontana
said no response had been received from the company.

   Union Pacific Corp. on Monday said the $532
million sale of its real estate unit for lack of financing.
   Union Pacific, parent of the Omaha-based Union Pacific Railroad,
forged the deal in December with the Koll Co., a real estate
development firm based in Newport Beach, Calif.
   ``They were unable to come up with the financing within the
required period of time,'' spokesman Marvin Zim said from Union
Pacific's headquarters in Bethlehem, Pa. The financing deadline
expired Friday.
   A spokeswoman for Koll said the company did obtain financing,
``but Union Pacific didn't feel it was satisfactory.'' She declined
to elaborate.
   Koll planned to acquire all of the assets of Union Pacific
Realty, a division that managed land holdings for the parent
corporation, including about 15,000 acres of property and 30
buildings, mostly in the western United States.
   Zim said Dallas-based Union Pacific Realty is still for sale.
Union Pacific authorized the sale of the real estate division last
April, saying it wanted to focus on its transportation operations.

<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS grafs 4-6: ``We think,'' with quotes from Darman,
Rostenkowski; SUBS 14th graf: ``Rostenkowski proposed,'' to CORRECT
that his 33 percent rate is not a new maximum but extends the

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration said Monday that
there's ``room to talk'' about a far-reaching budget plan by
Democrat Rep. Dan Rostenkowski that calls for higher taxes and a
one-year Social Security freeze.
   However, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
president's decision to consider the radical proposal by the
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee doesn't mean he's
abandoning his oft-stated opposition to new taxes or Social
Security changes.
   ``We don't want to pour too much cold water on a plan we may
want to swim around in for a while,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``We think he deserves a lot of credit for a courageous plan, a
courageous initiative, a serious initiative,'' White House budget
director Richard Darman said on the Public Broadcasting System's
``MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour.''
   Appearing on the same program, Rostenkowski acknowledged that
his proposal contained ``some political minefields,'' but added
that his plan's appeal was that it called for sacrifices from
everyone.
   ``I think you're going to get some positive responses from it if
we all get in the water together,'' he said.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., called Rostenkowski's
proposal a ``good step'' and said its across-the-board spending
freeze ``makes a great deal of sense.''
   ``His proposal could be the wake-up call we've been waiting
for,'' Dole said in a statement. ``We'll see who answers it.''
   On Capitol Hill, Rostenkowski spokesman Jim Jaffe welcomed the
plan's unexpectedly warm _ and apparently orchestrated _ reception
from the administration and Dole.
   ``Let's do it,'' he said.
   Still, Rostenkowksi's proposal, unveiled over the weekend, has
generated little support from his own party.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., called Rostenkowski's
plan ``a very interesting suggestion,'' but questioned its chances
of approval unless the White House supports it.
   ``I don't see a way we can effectively pass tax legislation
raising taxes without the approval of the president,'' Foley told a
reporter. ``That remains a problem.''
   Rostenkowski proposed chopping the federal deficit through a
combination of spending cuts; extending the maximum income tax rate
of 33 percent to all upper-income taxpayers instead of reducing to
28 percent above a certain ceiling as is now the case; higher taxes
on gasoline, liquor and cigarettes; and a one-year freeze in most
federal spending programs including Social Security.
   The goal is to reduce the annual budget deficit by 1994. It
would do away with the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law and its
graduated steps for balancing the budget.
   ``We think there's some room to talk,'' Fitzwater said. ``It
weaves a new pattern that needs to be considered at least.''
   In the past, the administration has been quick to denounce
Democratic plans that advocated either tax increases or a change in
the Social Security formula. Rostenkowski's plan would do both.
   There has been speculation about a grand compromise between the
White House and the Democratic-led Congress for reducing the budget
deficit, one that would embrace tax increases as well as
constraints in the growth of Social Security and other so-called
entitlement programs.
   Fitzwater would not characterize Rostenkowski's plan in such
terms, but said:
   ``We want to consider this plan. The chairman of the Ways and
Means Committee is certainly a very important figure. This is the
first comprehensive and thoughtful kind of plan we've seen.''
   Fitzwater shrugged off a suggestion that the adminstration's
posture _ formulated by Budget Director Richard Darman _ was
designed to put Democrats on the side of raising taxes and freezing
Social Security benefits while allowing President Bush to take
credit for deficit reduction.
   ``Never crossed my mind,'' Fitzwater said.
   Rostenkowski, Jaffe said, ``is used to playing the role of the
bad guy'' and that if takes that to win serious consideration of
the plan, then so be it.
   On the issue of taxes, Fitzwater said: ``Our general attitude
is, the less taxation the better.''
   Asked if that represented a retreat from Bush's no-new-taxes
proclamations of the past, Fitzwater said: ``I'm not signaling any
action on our part except to say this gives us a basis for
discussion.''
   Rostenkowski, of Illinois, contends a 1991 freeze in Social
Security benefits and other government programs coupled with new
taxes on cigarettes, alcohol, gasoline and the wealthy could reduce
the deficit by more than $500 billion over the next five years and
produce a balanced budget by 1994.
   The one-year freeze on Social Security benefits would affect
about 39 million Americans.
   Rostenkowski did not specify how much he would raise gasoline,
tobacco and alcohol taxes, other than to say they could provide a
total of $100 billion in new revenues over the next five years. But
he said in a television interview Sunday that he envisioned the
federal tax on gasoline rising from the current 9 cents a gallon to
20 cents or 25 cents.
   Dole, speaking to the National Association of Federal Credit
Unions, said there were parts of Rostenkowski's plan he disliked,
but praised the general concept and applauded the one-year-freeze
on programs.
   ``It's got to be everybody. No exceptions. No big interest
groups get off the hook,'' Dole said. ``I think it makes a great
deal of sense.''
   In remarks on the House floor, Rep. Fortney Pete Stark,
D-Calif., a member of the Ways and Means panel, offered support.
   ``It's a challenge to all of us in government,'' Stark said.
``It asks whether we're serious about getting the deficit down, and
it asks whether we're ready to abandon the blue smoke and mirrors
that have obscured the facts in this debate previously.''

   A Greyhound bus in Connecticut was hit by sniper fire Monday and
the chairman of the strike-crippled bus line offered a $25,000
reward for information about a weekend shooting in Florida that
injured eight passengers.
   ``We will not bend or move because of intimidation and
violence,'' Greyhound Chairman Fred G. Currey insisted before
boarding a Greyhound bus from Jacksonville to Orlando, Fla., then
taking a plane to Miami.
   No one was injured in the Connecticut shooting, which occurred
on Interstate 84 shortly before 11 a.m. as a New York-to-Boston
Greyhound bus headed into Hartford with 19 passengers. Passengers
reported hearing a small pop that some thought was a blown tire.
   Police recovered a bullet from the baggage compartment on the
driver's side, and were trying to determine the caliber and type of
gun used, said state police spokesman Adam Berluti.
   The Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions disavowed
responsibility for the Florida shooting, but a union spokesman in
Hartford said he believed the Connecticut shooting was motivated by
the strike against the only nationwide bus company.
   ``I would say it's probably strike-related because I have been
driving for 17 years and was never shot at,'' said spokesman
Charles True. However, pickets in Hartford denied that union
members were responsible.
   The union, which represents 6,300 drivers and more than 3,000
office and maintenance workers, went on strike March 2. There have
been scattered violent incidents since, including a striker crushed
to death by a bus operated by a replacement driver in Redding,
Calif., and shots fired at buses in Chicago and Phoenix.
   Currey, Greyhound's chairman and chief executive officer, and
Frank Schmeider, its president, flew to Jacksonville early Monday
from Dallas after learning of the Florida shooting.
   The eight passengers were hurt when someone fired a bullet
through the front of a Greyhound bus Sunday night in south
Jacksonville. The passengers were injured by fiberglass and
shrapnel.
   When asked if he thought the shot had come from a striker,
Currey said: ``I pray that it is not true. I hope that it is not
true. I do not want to believe that anybody involved in Greyhound
would do such as thing.''
   The two executives visited the three passengers still
hospitalized Monday. Five others were released after hospital
treatment. They also visited bus riders who were put up by the
company in a Jacksonville hotel overnight.
   One hospitalized passenger, Michael Rogers of Atlanta, was
critical of the company: ``I don't think they should run their
lines while they're having a situation like this going on. Or at
least warn the general public that a situation like that might
occur.''
   In Orlando, Currey criticized union leaders for not speaking out
against intimidation.
   ``Their silence is deafening,'' he said. Asked why he rode the
bus, he said: ``I took the trip because I thought it was important
for Greyhound people not to be intimidated.''
   An executive board member of the Jacksonville union local said
he didn't believe strikers were behind the shooting.
   ``As far as I'm concerned it wasn't one of our strikers,'' said
Bill Nicholson. ``They've been like choirboys.''
   Sheriff's spokesman Steve Weintraub said Monday there have been
no arrests in the shooting, and added that the possibility that the
shot came from a striker ``is one of the leads we are following.''
   The latest violence came as federal mediators in Washington,
D.C., met for three hours Monday for ``an exploratory, informal
meeting'' with union officials.
   Jim Power, a spokesman for the Federal Mediation Service, said
the union ``agreed to the possibility of additional meetings with
the mediation service and management to start the collective
bargaining process again.''
   Greyhound said executive Vice President P. Anthony Lannie,
Greyhound's chief negotiator, would meet Wednesday with the head of
the mediation service, Bernard DeLury.
   The company said it expected DeLury to present his
recommendations for ending the strike.
   Negotiations on a three-year contract broke down March 1 and the
two sides have had ony sporadic telephone contact since.
   In Miami, Currey said he was pessimistic about prospects for a
settlement of the strike soon.
   ``We made a very, very fine offer to the Greyhound Amalgamated
Council. They shouted it down, just as those men are shouting on
the street,'' he said, pointing to pickets outside. ``We will not
raise fares to meet the exorbitant demands of the drivers.''
   Currey later walked outside the terminal, embraced several
pickets and tried to answer questions about the company's position.
There was emotional arguing, but the discussion remained peaceful.
   A picket who didn't give his name said Currey ``had a lot of
guts'' for speaking with the strikers.
   In another development in New York City, a state judge upheld a
temporary restraining order barring Greyhound from hiring non-union
workers to replace strikers, said Amalgamated Union Local 1202
President Harold Mendlowitz.
   The judge scheduled a hearing for Thursday to determine whether
to issue a permanent injunction.
   ``New York City is a major hub of operations for Greyhound,''
Mendlowitz said. ``If we can stop them here, it will have a
significant impact for our strike nationwide.''
   Greyhound spokeswoman Elizabeth Hale disagreed on the ruling's
effect.
   ``It does not have a major impact nationwide,'' Hale said.
``We're hiring permanent replacements across the country and
putting people back to work who return to their jobs.''
   Greyhound, which serves 9,600 U.S. communities, said it has
restored service to an additional 120 communities that lost regular
runs when the strike began.
   Hale said 48,454 passengers rode 1,876 buses on Sunday. The
number of passengers amounted to 35.8 percent of the same day last
year while departures were 33.3 percent. The average load was 25.8
percent, 7.4 percent higher than last year.
