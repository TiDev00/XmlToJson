   Secretary of State James A. Baker III
said Wednesday that NATO membership for a unified Germany should be
up to the alliance, not the Soviet Union.
   But Baker said he is willing to consider the Kremlin's views
when he meets with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze
Friday and Saturday in Bonn.
   Partly to persuade the Soviet Union to accept a unified Germany
in NATO, Baker will tell NATO foreign ministers that the United
States will withdraw some nuclear artillery from Germany, and
favors prompt negotiations to eliminate other ground-based nuclear
weapons from Europe, The Washington Post said in Thursday editions.
   While Shevardnadze has recently signaled a willingness to drop
the Soviet demand that a unified Germany be neutral, Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said last weekend that his country's
``attitude toward unilateral, unbalanced proposals for the entry of
a future German state into NATO remains negative.''
   West Germany is the strongest U.S. ally in the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization. Similarly, East Germany was the staunchest
Soviet ally in the Warsaw Pact until its conversion to
Western-style political democracy earlier this year.
   Shortly after Baker left Washington, officials of the two German
states announced a tentative agreement on a plan for merging their
economies, settling basic differences over how the nations should
assess the costs of unification.
   Today's agreement, announced by officials in East Berlin, sets
the stage for a full merger of the economies of the two nations on
July 2.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has predicted political union
by the end of 1991.
   Baker, launching a five-day European trip in which Germany's
future will be the predominant issue, said the size of the German
army is a legitimate topic for East-West negotiators meeting in
Vienna.
   But, he said, ``The question whether the unified Germany should
be a member of NATO is a question that is properly decided in NATO
with the participation of a united Germany.''
   West Germany has become more and more reluctant to be host for
short-range nuclear weapons, because they would almost inevitably
explode on German territory if used.
   Gerhard Stoltenberg, the West German defense minister, said in a
speech in Washington on Tuesday that NATO might move to get rid of
all ground-based nuclear weapons, leaving only air-launched
missiles and bombs in its nuclear arsenal.
   According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies
in London, the United States and its allies in 1989 deployed 2,872
artillery pieces in NATO theoretically capable of firing nuclear
shells, while Warsaw Pact powers had 2,070.
   The United States has been retiring some older 8-inch guns
recently, and officials disclosed last month that the Pentagon had
put on hold development of a new edition of the nuclear-tipped
Lance missile.
   The United States has expected to begin talks with the Soviet
Union on short-range nuclear weapons in Europe later this year,
after conclusion of an agreement on convention weapons.
   Baker spoke to reporters aboard his Air Force jet en route to a
refueling stop here from Washington. He then flew to Brussels for
sessions Thursday with NATO and European Community foreign
ministers.
   Last Saturday, the 12-nation Community took strides toward
political union by 1993.
   France and West Germany led the drive. Britain, Denmark and
Portugal are hesitant. The Bush administration has not taken a
position, and Baker declined to be drawn into the matter.
   Baker will fly to Bonn on Friday for separate sessions with West
German Foreign Minister Hans Dietrich Genscher and with
Shevardnadze.
   On Saturday, the foreign ministers of the two Germanys and the
four wartime allies _ the United States, Britain, France and the
Soviet Union _ will meet.
   Among the issues Baker said they will take up is how to
relinquish four-power control of Berlin, which they have held since
Germany's defeat in 1945.
   But Germany's membership in NATO isn't a proper subject for
discussion with the Soviets, Baker said.
   ``The fact of the matter is you can't take a decision of that
nature without having the members of the alliance sitting at the
table. ...''
   At the meeting of the four wartime allies and the two Germanys,
``there will be, indeed, a very full and complete discussion of
that issue, because that is one of the foremost issues right now
that separate the alliance from the position of the Soviet Union,''
Baker said.
   The prospect of a united and stronger Germany in NATO has caused
alarm in Moscow and stirred memories of World War II, in which an
estimated 20 million Soviets perished.
   At times, Soviet leaders have called for dissolving both NATO
and the Warsaw Pact. Shevardnadze said last week that Germany
should become ``a testing ground'' of new forms of East-West
security cooperation.
   The Soviet foreign minister also has floated the idea of the
unified Germany being a member of both alliances. The Western
allies, meanwhile, have suggested keeping NATO troops out of what
is now East Germany.

   A minister pleaded with mourners at a
funeral Wednesday for one of three teen-age suicides to put aside
questions about what led to their deaths, and focus instead on
avoiding the same path.
   Thomas Smith, 17, was the first of three suicides among Sheridan
High School students in two days, and counselors for their
classmates were on 24-hour call. About 80 students missed classes
Wednesday, about 30 more than usual, school officials said.
   Some of the absentees were among about 250 people packed into
the Buie Funeral Home chapel to hear the Rev. Dennis Moon urge them
to cling to God as they grieved over Smith's death.
   ``Bringing back Tommy is beyond our control, but going with him
... is still our choice,'' said Moon during the 20-minute service.
   ``We don't need to ask God why he would let this happen,'' said
Moon, of the Landmark Baptist Chruch. ``We need to ask God what
would he want us to do.''
   A graveside service followed at a cemetery in Grapevine, some 23
miles from Sheridan.
   Five members of the school's ROTC, of which Smith was a member,
stood at attention about five feet from the casket. A man walked up
to each youth, removed a white flower from his uniform lapel and
set it in the youths' white gloves.
   As the gathering broke up, four young men approached a reporter
and three photographers and demanded their film. The photographers
refused; two of the youths threw rocks at the car as it left.
   On Monday, Smith stood in front of his American history class,
told a female classmate, ``I love you,'' pulled a gun out of his
pants and shot himself.
   Later that day, Chidester, 19, of the Grapevine community, a
friend of Smith's, died of a gunshot wound. He left a note that
said ``I can't go on any longer,'' according to police.
   On Tuesday, the body of Jerry Paul McCool, a 17-year-old
sophomore, was discovered in his home by his father. McCool, who
also had been shot, knew Smith and Chidester, but wasn't close with
them, officials said.
   All three deaths were ruled suicides, said Grant County Sheriff
Cary Clark.
   In addition to those deaths, a 17-year-old classmate shot
himself to death March 28. And three other county residents _ ages
22, 40, and 82 _ have killed themselves since Jan. 23.
   Hours after the latest shooting, parents and students packed the
school's 1,000-seat auditorium to discuss the suicides. Some held
hands. Some cried.
   About 60 counselors and clergymen from around the state had
arrived at the normally quiet bedroom community 30 miles south of
Little Rock.
   School Superintendent David Robinson said students met with
counselors in group sessions and one-on-one Wednesday.
   ``Obviously school, as such, is not occurring at the moment,''
Robinson said. ``Actually, it's more like a massive counseling
session.''
   Later Wednesday, he said the mood had improved. ``The bottom
line is we feel pretty good about how people are recovering. The
kids have told us they're ready to try to get back to normal.''
   Some said the atmosphere was less somber at the school Wednesday
than earlier in the week.
   Lisa Deal, 18, a senior and president of the student council,
said even though the mood had improved, the community had a long
way to go to get over the series of deaths.
   ``It's scary knowing your friends ... would go to these
extremes,'' she said. Ms. Deal said she was an acquaintance of
Smith and Chidester.
   ``The students really opened up here today,'' she said of the
counseling sessions. ``Yesterday was bad for us because it was
newer. Everybody had just heard about it.''
   Robinson, who held a news conference Wednesday morning, said he
also felt the situation was getting better.
   ``I think the fact that our students were involved in a kind of
organized session this morning and were able to express their
feelings helped,'' he said.

   Mexican officials on Wednesday asked for
the extradition of a man who says he masterminded the abduction of
a Mexican doctor accused of participating in the death of a U.S.
drug agent.
   Mexican Attorney General Enrique Alvarez del Castillo said
extradition papers are being prepared for Antonio Garate
Bustamante, who claims to be a Drug Enforcement Administration
operative who organized the kidnapping of Dr. Humberto Alvarez
Machain in Guadalajara on April 2.
   U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh met with Alvarez del
Castillo for more than an hour discussing drug enforcement efforts
as well as the current controversy over the alleged abduction of
Alvarez.
   ``We have in process a corresponding arrest order to solicit his
(Garate's) extradition from whichever country he is found,''
Alvarez del Castillo said in Spanish after the meeting.
   Thornburgh refused to say whether Alvarez del Castillo asked for
Garate's extradition during the meeting, adding that such requests
would be made through the U.S. State Department.
   Thornburgh said the matter of Alvarez' arrest will be dealt with
during a May 25 federal court hearing in Los Angeles.
   Garate, a former Mexican police officer, told the Los Angeles
Times last week that he arranged the abduction of Alvarez with
approval from the DEA. Garate said 10 Mexicans were promised
$100,000 for Alvarez' capture and delivery to El Paso, Texas,
according to the Times.
   Earlier, a spokesman for Alvarez del Castillo, Fernando Arias
Alvarez, said Mexico would ask for the extradition of others who
may have participated in the abduction of Alvarez.
   One of five men arrested in the abduction placed Garate at the
scene, Arias said. That man, Jorge Cobarrubias, an ex-policeman
from the Mexican state of Hidalgo, said he lined up the others to
help grab the doctor, said Arias.
   The abduction of the doctor has strained relations between the
United States and Mexico, which has threatened to stop cooperating
in the fight against drug trafficking.
   Arias also said that Mexico wants an agreement with the United
States that would allow Mexican drug agents to operate in the
United States, the same way U.S. DEA agents work in Mexico. There
are 41 DEA agents in Mexico, he said.
   The two country's ambassadors, John Negroponte of the United
States and Gustavo Petricioli of Mexico, were at Wednesday's
meeting, which was held as a three-day conference of border state
attorneys general began in Santa Fe, Arias said.
   The two attorneys general were talking about possible formal
charges against Garate and others, Arias said.
   Alvarez, a Guadalajara gynecologist, is charged in connection
with the 1985 death of drug agent Enrique Camarena. Prosecutors
allege that Alvarez gave Camarena drugs to revive him for
additional torture before his slaying.
   His trial has been delayed pending a court-ordered May 25
hearing in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on the matter of how
he was brought to the U.S. from Mexico.

   U.S. Rep. Donald Lukens, convicted of a
sex offense that threatens his career, is taking his case to the
voters.
   ``I apologize. I made a dumb mistake. I'm sorry,'' the
Republican said Wednesday in announcing for re-election less than a
week before Tuesday's primary.
   The 59-year-old divorced congressman was convicted of a
misdemeanor charge last year of contributing to the unrulinesss of
a minor for having sex with a 16-year-old girl at his Columbus
apartment in 1988.
   He was sentenced to 30 days in jail and fined $500 but is free
on appeal.
   Robert Bennett, chairman of the Ohio Republican Party, said
Lukens displayed ``a lapse of morals,'' and he repeated a call for
the congressman to resign. ``This is not a political matter; it's a
moral matter,'' he said.
   ``On May 8, I am sure the voters will do the right thing and say
goodbye to Donald `Buz' Lukens,'' Bennett said.
   Ohio Democratic Party Chairman James Ruvolo said he ``wouldn't
count (Lukens) out.'' He also said: ``I assume he's given Bob
Bennett heartburn.''
   Lukens is facing three Republican challengers _ former U.S. Rep.
Thomas Kindness, state Rep. John Boehner and bond underwriter Mort
Meier. Three candidates are running in the Democratic primary.
   Reaction to Lukens' re-election bid was mixed.
   Rita Hardman of Fletcher said she will vote for Lukens. ``I
think he has a lot of undercover supporters that don't have the
nerve to say, `I'm going to vote for him,' but will,'' she said.
   Dan Cook, a Republian, said Lukens' legal situation disqualifies
him in his mind. ``I think he's embarrassing to the party. I think
he's embarrassing to the whole government,'' he said. ``He's not
the good example that you would expect.''
   Lukens had said since his conviction that he wouldn't decide on
his political future until after the outcome of his appeal. He
filed for re-election but hadn't openly campaigned.
   Appearing with his mother, he made his announcement Wednesday
before about 20 supporters outside the post office in this farming
village of 515.
   ``I apologize for the situation I allowed to be created,''
Lukens said. ``I made a bad mistake. But the mistake was not evil
and not criminal. I'm saying I'm not guilty of the charge.''
   Boehner said he doesn't believe Lukens will be a factor in the
race, and he called the congressman's announcement a ``last-ditch
effort'' to save his job.
   ``I guess it surprises me that after all this time he would
conveniently come to the conclusion that he ought to apologize six
days before the election,'' Boehner said.
   Donald Birgel, chairman of the Butler County Republican Party,
said Lukens could win. ``His supporters will be there at the
polls,'' Birgel said. ``They're not going to stay home.''
   Lukens served in Congress from 1967 to 1970, when he made an
unsuccessful attempt to gain the GOP gubernatorial nomination.
After 15 years in the Ohio Senate, he returned to Congress in 1986.

<TEXT>
   A Bible Belt prosecutor has pulled the
plug on a national X-rated TV channel that beamed movies like
``Ramb-Ohhh! Sex Platoon'' and ``Hardcore Girlfriends'' to
satellite dish owners.
   Civil libertarians are alarmed by the ease with which District
Attorney Jimmy Evans, a Democratic candidate for state attorney
general, drove New York-based Home Dish Satellite Networks Inc. out
of business.
   ``What's happened is some little small town in the South is
setting the standard for the rest of the country,'' said Martin
McCaffery, vice president of the Civil Liberties Union of Alabama.
``It's a horrendous precedent.''
   Evans says adult films have no First Amendment protection.
``These movies not only violate Alabama's obscenity law, they
violate every state obscenity law and the federal obscenity law,''
he said. ``This is a national scandal.''
   He said he began an investigation after parents complained that
their young children were obtaining videotapes of pornographic
movies broadcast on the American Exxxtasy Channel, which was
operated by Home Dish.
   ``I know from experience that hardcore obscenity leads to the
abuse of women and children,'' the Montgomery County prosecutor
said. ``It's bad for our community and bad for our children.''
   The American Exxxtasy Channel transmitted hard-core movies to
home satellite subscribers, but it also operated the Tuxxedo
Channel, a cable channel featuring R-rated ``soft-core'' porn.
   In February, a grand jury in Montgomery returned more than 500
indictments against Home Dish, three other out-of-state companies
and 10 people on charges of distributing hardcore pornography via
satellite into Alabama.
   The other indicted companies _ General Telephone and Electronics
Corp., GTE Spacenet Corp. and U.S. Satellite Inc. _ provided the
satellite capability for American Exxxtasy, but they pleaded
ignorance and cut off Home Dish service.
   The Tuxxedo Channel soon met the same fate. Its broadcasts to
local cable affiliates and dish owners were removed from a
satellite owned by General Motors Corp. after a grand jury returned
another indictment against Home Dish.
   Home Dish, which had reached 1.2 million cable customers and
80,000 satellite-equipped homes, had to lay off its 100 employees.
Its president, Paul Klein, and three other company officials still
face an Alabama extradition request.
   ``I can't fight it,'' said Klein, a former NBC executive. ``I'm
small and very vulnerable. I'm out of business and they're still
trying to extradite me.'' New York Gov. Mario Cuomo has the
extradition request ``under review,'' his office said.
   ``Without proving that anything is obscene, Jimmy Evans has
succeeded in bankrupting this company and keeping the rest of the
country from seeing these movies in the privacy of their home,''
McCaffery said.
   Klein said his channels, which had 30 satellite customers in
Montgomery and about 600 around the state, were ``meant for
consenting adults.'' But perhaps thousands of others were stealing
the service with illegal descramblers.
   Klein said many Tuxxedo affiliates switched their subscribers to
one of two other soft-core cable channels, Rendezvous and Playboy.
Evans said he knows nothing of those channels, which Montgomery's
only cable company doesn't offer.
   Evans, Montgomery's chief prosecutor since 1973, went after
adult magazines in 1986, while in his first, unsuccessful bid to
become attorney general.
   Playboy and Penthouse magazines fought back, filing a lawsuit
that accused Evans of arbitrarily listing about 50 adult magazines
as obscene and then pressuring Montgomery-area merchants not to
sell them.
   A federal judge sided with the publishers in a sharply worded
order that barred Evans from bringing criminal charges against
merchants for past sales of sexually explicit magazines.
   Despite the order, convenience stores and other merchants
continued to refrain from selling hard-core sex magazines.
   Last year, Evans attacked adult videotapes. Thirteen businesses
were charged with selling and renting allegedly obscene tapes.
About 130 indictments were returned against the businesses, their
managers and other store employees.
   The cases never went to trial. The stores agreed to pay fines
and remove the offending tapes from their shelves.
   Evans denies that he's mixing politics with porn. But he'll be
the first to admit that he's ready to expand his smut-busting
campaign from the confines of Montgomery, a city of 180,000.
   ``When I get in the attorney general's office, there's not going
to be a single hamlet or village or city in this state that's going
to have that kind of stuff for sale,'' he said.

<HEAD>Glasnost On Paris Runways: Velour-Clad Guns and Miniskirts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After years as the butt of Western jokes, East Bloc
fashion hit the Paris runways with a display of such
glasnost-inspired styles as see-through culottes, minuscule minis
and a velour-covered submachine gun.
   Four designers from the Soviet Union, Poland, Hungary and East
Germany paraded their creations before a small group of invited
guests at the Prince de Galles Marriott Hotel on Wednesday.
   It was a preview of a big fashion show-cocktail party for 700
guests to be held tonight at the Salle Wagram, a dance
hall-turned-auditorium. A prize will be awarded by the Lalique
crystal company to the most talented designer.
   Whoever wins will be happy, but all four designers were pleased
to be showing in Paris, widely viewed as the West's fashion capital.
   Soviet designer Lena Zelinskaia, 25, startled the audience with
shiny velour culotte suits in fire-engine red, turquoise blue and
grass green _ accompanied by matching velour-wrapped submachine
guns.
   She denied the guns were a ploy to attract photographers.
   ``The machine-gun accessory symbolizes the Russian Revolution,
which is still very much in our minds,'' Zelinskaia said, taking a
bow with the other designers after the show.
   Her clothes were a far cry from the Western image of Soviet
fashion, perhaps most mercilessly parodied in a TV commercial for
Wendy's, in which a matronly model in a drab dress for daywear
merely adds a flashlight for evening, and a beach ball for swimwear.
   As for the future of Soviet design, she said: ``It won't be
French. We're a different country with different religion and
politics. But we have many tendencies, and I can't speak for the
others _ only myself.''
   ``I'm an old designer, in the business for 30 years,'' said
Polish creator Jerzy Antkowiak, 50, who displayed the most variety
in his preview. His clothes ranged from a flowing gray crepe de
chine printed duster over a wide long pantskirt to a deep red
taffeta mini-dress with several daring cutouts on the back and a
transparent navy long-culottes outfit.
   ``We've got many problems in Poland,'' said Antkowiak, dressed
in a loose charcoal linen suit and ochre scarf. ``For instance, we
have to import all our fabrics. But we have hopes that we'll get
investments from the West to set up better manufacturing and
business.''
   The show was organized by the Ecole Superieure de Commerce de
Compiegne, a French business school north of Paris. Last year the
school featured top Soviet designer Slava Zaitsev.
   This year's choice of designers evolved from embassy suggestions
and from connections that one of the organizers, Boris Bostjancic,
has with Moscow Contact, a new firm that seeks to set up East-West
commercial agreements.
   East German designer Anja Wenzel showed attractive long looks,
featuring some folklore-inspired fabric mixes and a black chiffon
halter-necked jumpsuit with a metal snake slithering up back and
front.
   Hungarian designer Katelin Berenyi, 24, has lived in Paris for
the past two years, studying at the national decorative arts school.
   One of her outfits _ reminiscent of Pierre Cardin _ included a
velvet micro-mini over thigh-high socks and cone-shaped, pleated
gauntlets of white paper on the model's arms.
   ``I love crazy fashions,'' said Antkowiak, who admits that his
clothes look way-out and are expensive for Poland _ about $50 a
dress. He said they are usually purchased by privileged richer
women, diplomats and tourists.
   ``So far, I have to keep prices high,'' he said. ``Because if I
offer cheaper models, my old clientele asks why, and doesn't want
to buy them. They want to be special.''

   Police swarmed into a gritty park and clashed
with squatters holding a May Day festival Tuesday night after
people began throwing bottles to protest an abrupt end to a park
concert, police said.
   The clash at Tompkins Square Park in the East Village left 12
officers injured, and several protesters were arrested, police said.
   Dozens of homeless people live in the park. Tensions have flared
the past two summers when police moved to oust the squatters.
   Concert-goers began throwing bottles when police turned out the
lights to the bandshell at 9 p.m. because the band had a permit to
play only until then, said Police Capt. Charles Hanley.
   ``There were about 300 people there,'' Hanley said. ``They got
angry, started throwing bottles. It was basically a riot.''
   The injured officers suffered assorted head and hand injuries,
said Hanley and Lt. Dave Fenton. Police apparently made their first
charge after a Parks Department officer was hit in the face with a
bottle.
   Rob Nunzio, 27, lead guitarist in the band Antidote, was on
stage when the lights went out, said: ``When they shut the music
off, people started protesting. The cops came in from Avenue A. It
looked like hundreds of them. People started screaming at the
cops...The cops grabbed whoever was in their way and threw them
down.''
   ``One cop got hit by a bottle while on stage and got very mad
and started trashing our equipment,'' said another musician, Jason
Goodrow.
   Later, about 50 police officers wearing helmets and carrying
shields and nightsticks remained in the park. Dozens of people were
walking around the neighborhood, knocking over garbage cans and
setting trash on fire.
   Others sat down in the street by the park, chanting at police
officers: ``The cops started the riot.''
   About half hour later, at 11 p.m., a skirmish broke out when
about four officers on scooters apparently tried to break through a
line of 50 protesters. The protesters retaliated by knocking the
officers off their scooters, prompting about two dozens officers to
rush in, pushing aside the protesters and dragging one of them off.
   The ``Squatter May Day'' festival, featuring live music,
contests and food, began Saturday and was scheduled to end Tuesday
at the East Village park.
   On Aug. 6-7, 1988, the park was bloodied by a four-hour clash
between demonstrators and police that left 52 people injured.
   Last summer, there were numerous arrests during several
standoffs between police and the park's denizens that began July 5
when police tore down a tent city and evicted more than 130 people.

<HEAD>Brazil Considers Radical Idea: Paying Bills by Mail</HEAD>

   The Post Office is proposing a
revolutionary idea _ that the 150 million people of Latin America's
largest country pay their bills by mail instead of standing in line.
   Brazil is modern in many ways, but you still cannot write a
check for your electricity bill, put it in a stamped envelope and
drop it in a mailbox.
   Virtually all bills are paid at banks, which are clogged with
long lines of grumbling, sweaty people holding stacks of
electricity, gas, and water bills; school, department store, health
insurance and credit card accounts, auto license fees and
statements of income or property taxes.
   A specialized commercial culture has sprouted around the
practice. Companies and wealthy individuals hire young men,
universally called ``office boys,'' to do their standing and paying.
   One company's office boy presented a check to pay the telephone
bill, but the bank insisted on cash. He went to the company's own
bank, which said it would take a check but must have a new one
naming the bank as payee. In desperation, the office boy returned
to the first bank, where the manager finally made an exception and
accepted the check.
   The Post Office wants to make things simpler.
   Its press spokesman, Jose Valfranio Medeiros de Oliveira, said
in an interview: ``There's nothing easier than paying bills by
mail, and we want to make life easier for our citizens.''
   Some newspapers have begun, rather timidly, to support the
program.
   ``Yes, there is a long tradition here of not paying by mail,''
Oliveira said, ``but we have the infrastructure, we have
credibility. There's no reason this won't work.''
   This month, he said, the Post Office will run a test program
allowing people in the northeastern state of Bahia, population 11.6
million, to pay telephone bills by mail. If that goes well, the
experiment will be extended to other states and to bills for water,
gas and federal taxes.
   ``All Brazil's 4,000-plus townships have post offices, whereas
one-third don't have banks,'' Oliveira said.
   ``In addition, there are 22,000 public mailboxes and 3,000 rural
collection points on farms and ranches. Post offices have longer
hours than banks. Some post offices are open on weekends.''
   Brazil's largest commercial bank, the government-controlled
Banco do Brasil, announced plans for a ``Citizens' Comfort,'' a
program that would allow even people without accounts at the bank
to mail it their checks for water, electricity, gas and federal tax
bills.
   Alberto Policaro, the bank president, said that would make life
easier for Brazilians and ``free bank workers from receiving bills
and let them get on with the bank's real business _ taking in
deposits and making loans.''
   Public acceptance of such a departure is far from universal.
   Luis Sant'Anna Mendes, a Rio teletype operator who used to work
for the Post Office telegraph service, said: ``I'd rather wait in
line at a bank. That way you have confirmation that you paid.''
   At a bank, you get a stub with a machine stamp showing the
amount paid.
   Oliveira said post offices could provide the same kind of
receipt. That means bill payers would have to line up at the post
office, of course, but the press spokesman said: ``Our lines move
faster than bank lines.''
   Surveys by Brazil's largest private polling company, known as
IBOPE, indicate the Post Office is Brazil's most trusted public
institution, but skepticism persists.
   ``You just don't know if the letter really will get there,''
Mendes said.
   Another problem is that Brazilian banks do not return canceled
checks; they keep check records on microfilm. In the case of a
disputed payment, the payer would have to line up at the bank to
see his account record.
   ``There are technical details to be worked out,'' Oliveira
acknowledged, ``but if you can pay bills by mail in the United
States and Europe, there's no reason you can't do it in Brazil
too.''

<HEAD>Nation's Zoos Hunt for Ugly African Mammal</HEAD>

   Looks aren't everything. If they were, zoo
curators across the country wouldn't be scrambling to get their own
colonies of naked mole rats.
   The fanged, 4-inch African mammals are desired for their
subterranean social habits, not their pink, wrinkled, looks.
   ``They're not the most attractive mammal I've ever seen,'' said
James Doherty, general curator at New York's Bronx Zoo, which plans
to open an exhibit next winter.
   Since March 1989, the Cincinnati Zoo has had the nation's only
display of the hairless mole rats, but the Brookfield Zoo near
Chicago plans to open its exhibit May 18. Zoos in Philadelphia and
London have mole rats that are not on display while zoos in Phoenix
and Washington, D.C., are seeking colonies.
   ``It continues to be a popular attraction, because they catch
your eye for one reason or another,'' said Randy Morgan, an
entomologist who oversees the Cincinnati Zoo's 40-rat exhibit. ``I
don't think of them as ugly. I think they come across as bizarre,
animated and comical.''
   Zoo curators and scientists say mole rats' beauty and
significance are in their lifestyles. Virtually blind, they live
underground and burrow in a constant search for food, tubers and
roots they find by stumbling upon them.
   However, they are distinguished by their social system, Morgan
said Tuesday.
   They live in colonies of about three dozen. Only one female in
each colony breeds, using her sharp teeth to fend off challengers
and secreting a scent that inhibits other females from developing
into queens.
   Only one or two males mate with the queen and researchers are
uncertain how they are selected, Morgan said. All other able-bodied
mole rats search for food, for themselves and the queen.
   In exhibits, they scamper backward as easily as forward, yanking
other mole rats out of the way by their tails and digging through
wood and cork shavings within their home.
   They sleep in huddles, piling on top of each other for warmth.
But a pile of naked mole rats is seldom still. If one twitches in
its sleep, the entire huddle shudders, Morgan said.
   Documented more than a century ago, naked mole rats are found
only under the desert of Kenya in eastern Africa. Zoos pay about
$200 an animal, said Bruce Brewer, curator of mammals at the
Brookfield Zoo.
   Zoo curators credit South African researcher Jennifer Jarvis
with bringing mole rats to light, which piqued zoos' interest.
   The problem with zoo displays was the mole rats' extreme
sensitivity to sound and vibration, Doherty said. The rats are
easily panicked by the slightest sound or vibration and their huge
incisors can rapidly scratch plexiglass into a frosted, opaque
shield.
   ``We kind of whisper around them,'' Doherty said.
   Zoos have developed ways to shock-proof their mole rat habitats,
some building mazes of glass tubes on tables embedded in sand and
others erecting double glass walls that trap air as insulation.
   Reaction from zoo patrons varies when they first see naked mole
rats, Morgan said.
   ``It varies from `Oh yuck' to `Oh my God,''' Morgan said. ``They
see mole or rat on the display and think `these are the things in
my front yard.'
   ``But for people who take time to read about them, they are
amazed,'' he said. ``On busy days, people are lined up three to
four deep.''

<TEXT>
   Oriental food is king in this Queen City
of the Ozarks, where even the burger joints serve the dish that all
Springfield craves: Cashew chicken.
   Ozark cuisine may conjure up images of pan-fried trout and
catfish, fried chicken, mashed potatoes and gravy. But just as
surely as Bostonians bake beans and Chicagoans take pride in pizza,
Springfield's culinary claim to fame is cashew chicken.
   More than 50 of Springfield's 375 licensed restaurants feature
Chinese food. Another dozen or so Korean, Polynesian, Japanese and
Vietnamese restaurants contribute to a gastronomic smorgasbord for
Asian food lovers.
   ``I'm a Chinese food nut. With a Chinese restaurant on every
corner, I'm in heaven,'' says Gary Wilson, an attorney and regular
at the all-you-can-eat noon and evening buffets offered by many of
the restaurants.
   But not just any Chinese food. Chinese restaurants here are
judged not for their moo goo gai pan or egg rolls, but for their
cashew chicken. And not just Chinese restaurants. Even cafeterias
and burger shops serve up the dish.
   Springfield's unofficial nickname says it all: ``Cashew Chicken
Capital of the Midwest.''
   One newspaper columnist took calculator in hand and figured that
Springfield restaurants serve a minimum of 6,697 to 8,554 orders of
cashew chicken a day. That averages out to 2.4 million to 3.1
million orders a year.
   Springfield's variation on the dish isn't the standard cashew
chicken dish found around the country, where stir-fried chicken and
vegetables are mixed with cashews.
   Chefs here dip the chicken in batter, deep-fat fry it, smother
it with a thick brown sauce made from chicken stock and soy sauce,
add cashews and a few bits of green onion and serve the concoction
beside a bed of fried rice.
   One aficionado fondly describes the meal as ``kind of like
chicken McNuggets with gravy.''
   So peculiar is the cashew chicken recipe to Springfield that
Chinese restaurants in cities like Dallas, Chicago, Kansas City and
St. Louis that try to imitate it identify the dish on menus as
``Springfield cashew chicken.''
   But the cashew chicken served outside of Springfield, a regional
trade and health center in southwestern Missouri, usually falls
short of the dish current and former residents crave.
   ``I've never tasted the cashew chicken I loved in Springfield
anywhere else,'' says Timolyn Skeeters, a flight attendant based in
Charlotte, N.C., and a graduate of Southwest Missouri State
University in Springfield. ``I miss it. Out here cashew chicken is
just regular chicken and a few cashews. I think the secret must be
in the sauce.''
   The roots of Springfield's love affair with cashew chicken can
be traced to 1963.
   That was when David Leong and his wife, Shau, left Florida to
found Leong's Tea House, Springfield's first Chinese restaurant. At
first, Ozarkers were skeptical of Chinese food.
   ``My father noticed that people here liked fried chicken,'' said
Ling Leong, president of his family's restaurant and Chinese
specialty foods company. ``So he cut it into bite-size pieces and
served it with a special sauce and cashews and rice.''
   Springfield cashew chicken was born and quickly became a hit
among the meat-and-potatoes crowd.
   Soon more Chinese, then Vietnamese, began moving to Springfield,
where minorities still account for barely 2 percent of the
population. They opened restaurants, and virtually every one
featured cashew chicken.
   ``I think one reason cashew chicken became popular is because
this is chicken country,'' said Woodrow Sun, who with his wife,
Aurora, owns four Chinese restaurants. ``People like to eat
chicken. Eighty percent of my restaurants' sales are chicken
dishes.''
   The low price of cashew chicken _ ranging from about $2.50 for a
carryout order to around $7 in full-service restaurants _ appeals
to families and the 25,000 students attending four colleges in the
city.
   Leong said he'd heard two more Chinese restaurants would open
this year.
   ``If they asked me, my advice would be don't do it,'' Sun said
with a wry smile. ``That's all this town needs is another Chinese
restaurant.''

<DATELINE>MASSAWA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Day and night, heavy artillery and tank
barrages thunder along a 90-mile front, in what might be the
decisive battle of the nearly 30-year-old Eritrean civil war,
Africa's longest-running conflict.
   The battle raging between Ethiopian government troops and
Eritrean rebels in Ethiopia's northernmost province is possibly the
most destructive conflict in the world today, resulting in
thousands of casualties on both sides.
   The rebels appear to have the upper hand in the fighting along
what is called the Ghinda front. So fierce are the artillery and
tank exchanges that their distant rumble can be heard clearly in
the strategic Red Sea port of Massawa, about 37 miles away.
   Massawa, now in rebel hands, was the target of six Ethiopian air
raids in April by Soviet-built MiG fighters. Rebel spokesmen say at
least 110 people, many of them civilians, have been killed in the
cluster bomb attacks.
   The antagonists in the fight are the Marxist government of
President Mengistu Haile Mariam and rebel forces dominated by the
Eritrean People's Liberation Front, which seek independence for the
province of 3.5 million people. The Eritrean Front is considered
left-leaning, but its leaders say they reject any political
identification tag.
   The government forces' immediate objective is to recapture
Massawa, one of only two Ethiopian Red Sea harbors that have
traditionally handled most of the country's trade and international
relief supplies for millions of famine victims.
   The port was captured by the Eritreans on Feb. 11, three days
after they launched a major new offensive in their 29-year-old war
of secession.
   The rebels have their sights set on a bigger objective _ the
capture of their ancient, hallowed provincial capital of Asmara and
the end to a conflict that has claimed hundreds of thousands of
lives.
   The Ghinda front straddles the only road from Asmara to Massawa,
a two-lane ribbon of asphalt stretching 62 miles.
   The Addis Ababa government has issued few war communiques, but
in a rare pronouncement acknowledged last Friday that the battle
had ``reached a decisive final stage.''
   The last previous government statement on the conflict came in
mid-February, shortly after the fall of Massawa to the rebels.
   At that time, Mengistu told parliament that failure to recapture
Massawa would mean the loss of his 2nd Revolutionary Army, Asmara,
and Eritrea itself.
   That now seems likely.
   Mengistu's 2nd Army, more than 100,000 strong, representing
almost a third of Ethiopia's military strength, is virtually
surrounded in the highlands around Asmara. Its only remaining
supply route is a tenuous air link from government-held territory
far to the south and east.
   Another major rebel force, the Tigre People's Liberation Front,
has tied up Mengistu's remaining armies in an offensive that has
taken the Tigreans to within 100 miles of the capital of Addis
Ababa. The Tigreans are seeking Mengistu's ouster.
   The Ethiopian government claims, and the Eritrean rebels freely
acknowledge, that the two offensives by the separate rebel forces
have been coordinated. The Tigrean rebels began their offensive
last August, sweeping south and east out of their stronghold of
Tigre Province, just south of Eritrea.
   Isayas Afeworki, the general secretary of the Eritrean rebel
movement, says his strategy is to bleed Mengistu's 2nd Army dry on
the Ghinda front, then retake the offensive.
   ``There is no hope for the dergue (government) to take back
Massawa,'' Afeworki said. ``I think what they are doing is
motivated by desperation.''
   A new offensive, aimed at Asmara from the south, already is
under way, but it is unclear if it is being pursued by the
Eritreans or the Tigreans.
   Ethiopia claims a Tigrean force has pushed northward,
overrunning three government garrisons south of Asmara and behind
the Ghinda front. The Eritreans claim the new move as their own.
   On the Ghinda front, Afeworki said the Ethiopian army had made
three major attempts to retake Massawa in the past month, but
described it as ``a futile, suicidal effort.''
   Afeworki and other rebel leaders said the 2nd Army's only access
to the lowland plains leading to the Red Sea is through a few,
narrow mountain roads that are easy to choke.
   ``They have to get through our artillery, tank and mortar fire,
then our minefields. Then our fighters pop up out of their bunkers
and chew up those that remain,'' Afeworki said.
   The rebels claim they have inflicted some 13,000 casualties on
government forces in nearly a month of fighting along the Ghinda
front, including 6,000 killed. They don't talk in specific numbers
about their own losses, but Afeworki said they were less than a
tenth of the government's.
   Ethiopia's armed forces are the largest in black Africa,
numbering 315,800. The International Institute for Strategic
Studies, based in London, estimates the Eritrean rebel force at
30,000, and the Tigreans at 20,000.
   The government and the rebels have made exaggerated battlefield
claims which cannot be independently verified. But there is no
doubt about the ferocity of the fighting.
   In recent testimony to a Senate committee in Washington, the
assistant secretary of state for African affairs, Herman J. Cohen,
described the conflict as ``possibly the largest in terms of
combatants and the most destructive in the world today.''
   The intensified fighting follows two unsuccessful rounds of
peace talks held late last year between government and rebel
emissaries under the mediation of former President Jimmy Carter in
Nairobi, Kenya, and Atlanta.

<HEAD>May Day Melee Shows Public Anger Against Gorbachev</HEAD>

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev drummed his fingers
as protesters in Red Square shouted, ``Resign!'' but he showed no
anger over a demonstration that he himself authorized.
   ``Food is not a Luxury,'' read one sign, protesting the failure
of Gorbachev's reforms to deliver economic benefits.
   ``A Dictator is a President Without an Election,'' said another
slogan, referring to Gorbachev's appointment as president in March
by a legislature that also granted him sweeping powers beyond those
he enjoys as general secretary of the Communist Party.
   In a nation where pollsters have not published comprehensive
opinion surveys on the leader's popularity, the May Day outburst
was the clearest sign yet of rising public anger over a slowdown in
reforms under Gorbachev.
   Such an outburst may have been just what Gorbachev had in mind
when he signed a presidential order last month moving control over
demonstrations in Moscow from the city government to the national
Council of Ministers. The council, made up of Gorbachev's
supporters, approved Tuesday's unofficial demonstration.
   ``They weren't surprised. They knew exactly what to expect,''
said Leonid Zhuralev, one of the tens of thousands of protesters
who filed through Red Square.
   Gorbachev might use the protest to persuade reluctant
hard-liners to agree to radical economic reforms that he has
promised recently.
   He has used the tactic before. On Feb. 4, a crowd officially
estimated at 200,000 gathered outside the Kremlin demanding a
multiparty system.
   Three days later, conservatives on the Communist Party Central
Committee bowed to Gorbachev's suggestion that the constitution be
amended to deprive the party of its monopoly on power.
   In the five years since he became party general secretary,
Gorbachev has managed to turn nearly every defeat into a victory,
staying a step or two ahead of his opponents on the right and left.
   He could be in for the harshest test yet of his political
agility in the coming weeks.
   The parliament of the Russian Federation, the largest of the 15
Soviet republics, convenes for the first time on May 16, and it
could elect Gorbachev's populist rival Boris Yeltsin as president
of the republic.
   The party is in turmoil. It opens a congress on July 2, and is
widely expected to split into at least three factions, left and
right, with Gorbachev supporters in the middle.
   After elections in March, radical reformers took over the Moscow
and Leningrad city governments.
   Radicals, like many of the May Day protesters, want to move more
quickly to a market economy.
   Conservatives, such as party apparatchiks and many military
officers, oppose market reforms and fear the uncertainties of
political change.
   ``Many wise men of economics are calling us to plunge headlong
into a market economy, trusting our luck,'' said Yevgeny Kuznetsov,
a union leader who addressed the May Day crowd before the
protesters filed through Red Square.
   ``But we won't be able to trust our luck if we don't beforehand
take into account the consequences: growth in prices, a fall in the
standard of living, and unemployment,'' Kuznetsov said.
   The conservatives are also angry that Gorbachev allowed the
collapse of the Soviet empire in Eastern Europe, and the
declaration of independence by Lithuania. The May Day protesters,
by contrast, shouted: ``Freedom for Lithuania!''
   The domestic furor has deflected Soviet attention from an aspect
of Gorbachev's policies that has made him popular in the West, the
pursuit of arms control and the reduction of world tension.
   And that means Gorbachev may not get much of a boost at home
from his planned summit meeting with President Bush at the end of
what has already started as a very harried month of May.

<HEAD>Judge Gives Texas a Reprieve in School Finance Overhaul</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Session begins 3 p.m. EDT; lead prospects uncertain.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Gov. Bill Clements called the Legislature
into session today for a third try at school finance reform after a
judge gave the state another month to devise a plan to send more
money to poor schools.
   If the Legislature and Clements cannot agree on a plan this
time, one will be written for them, state District Judge Scott
McCown said Tuesday.
   ``The present scheme of public school finance is a great wrong.
... The poor have waited for too long,'' McCown said as he extended
the Texas Supreme Court's Tuesday deadline for overhauling school
financing to June 1.
   The reprieve allowed a $500 million state aid payment to be made
in May and ensured schools will stay open through this school year.
   McCown warned there will be no further deadline extensions. The
Texas Supreme Court ruled 9-0 last year in favor of property-poor
school districts that challenged the current $13.5 billion-a-year
system as unfair.
   School spending in Texas, as in many states, is based mostly on
property taxes.
   State Education Commissioner William Kirby said he feared a
third legislative failure would lead to a court-written plan. He
said that the court can only shift money around, not raise taxes,
and that any court-ordered solution would be a ``Robin Hood'' one _
``taking from the rich, giving to the poor.''
   Other school officials praised the ruling.
   ``If it needs to be corrected judiciously, so be it,'' said
Charles Hohertz, superintendent of the Shallowater Independent
School District, one of 54 school systems that took part in the
suit.
   The second attempt to overhaul school financing failed over a
proposed tax increase Tuesday.
   The Democratic-controlled Legislature had approved a $555
million reform plan. To pay for it, legislators proposed cutting
$114 million from the budget and raising the state sales tax from 6
cents to 6{ cents on the dollar.
   But Clements, a Republican, vetoed the tax increase. He said the
money should be taken from other programs.
   In case Clements and lawmakers fail again, the judge Tuesday
said he would appoint a special master to get started on a finance
plan of his own.
   At Edgewood High School in San Antonio, where many classrooms
are not air-conditioned and lockers and bathrooms are in disrepair,
educators and students said they were not optimistic about
lawmakers solving the problem by June 1.
   But Pat Ramirez, an English teacher, said she knew how to make
lawmakers deal with the issue.
   ``Just come and sit in a classroom with four fans blowing hot
air, if you're lucky enough to be in a room that has four fans like
mine, and you would come up with something very quickly,'' she said.
   Texas is one of a dozen states where courts have overturned
school finance systems deemed unfair to poor districts.
   The others are Kentucky, New Jersey, Kansas, Wisconsin,
California, Connecticut, Washington, West Virginia, Wyoming,
Arkansas and Montana.

<HEAD>Pentagon Tries to Sell Rejected Radar as Anti-Drug Tool</HEAD>

   The Pentagon, touting the contribution its new
radar could make in the drug war, is seeking money for the
high-tech system that Congress wouldn't buy for its military value.
   The $242.8 million radar, which would scan deep into Mexico to
find drug-smuggling aircraft, has resurfaced as the costliest item
in the Defense Department's 1991 counter-drug budget.
   Congressional investigators question whether moving the system
to the popular and growing anti-drug budget is a maneuver to save
it.
   ``I categorically deny it,'' said Michael A. Wermuth, deputy
assistant secretary of defense for drug enforcement policy.
   The Defense Department tried to sell a southern-facing sector of
``over the horizon backscatter'' radar to Congress in fiscal years
1989 and 1990 _ citing a potential bomber threat from Latin America.
   But lawmakers such as Rep. Nicholas Mavroules, D-Mass., chairman
of the House Armed Services investigations subcommittee, were
unconvinced and declined to approve the project.
   Mavroules said there was ``absolutely not, in my judgment,'' a
bomber threat from Latin America. The lawmaker said he wants to
investigate the budget shuffle, but is willing to let the Pentagon
prove the radar is an effective tool in drug interdiction.
   The first ``backscatter'' system became operational April 24 in
Bangor, Maine, to protect the Atlantic coast. Wermuth said test
results showed it could detect the slow-moving, low-flying drug
planes that plod toward the U.S. southwest border.
   Other ``backscatter'' sites are under construction in the West,
and Congress also has agreed to construction of the radar in Alaska.
   ``This is not a system that has been purchased exclusively for
counter-narcotics,'' said the Pentagon's Wermuth, arguing there
still is a long-term bomber threat from the south even if there's
no current threat from Latin America.
   He said the southern-looking sector of ``backscatter'' was moved
to the drug budget ``in recognition of the contribution that part
of the system will make in the counter-narcotics effort.''
   The central-southwest sector of ``backscatter'' comprises
one-fifth of the Pentagon's $1.2 billion anti-drug budget for the
coming fiscal year. This year, the military is expected to spend
$887 million to combat illegal drugs, Wermuth said.
   A House Armed Services Committee staff member familiar with the
decision not to fund the southern-beamed radar, said skepticism
about a bomber threat from Latin America was the dominant reason
the project was not approved.
   The staffer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it is a
common ploy of the Pentagon to transfer controversial programs into
``the sacred cow of the day. Right now it's drugs.''
   ``It raises the question of whether it's just a shuffle to get a
system that may not be justified to meet a military threat,'' said
Louis Rodrigues, who is directing a General Accounting Office
investigation into the radar system's cost-effectiveness.
   The investigation was requested by the Senate Armed Services
Committee.
   If ``backscatter'' works as planned, it would be able to spot
even the smallest smuggler aircraft somewhere over Mexico, long
before it reached the border.
   The high-tech system bounces powerful radio beams off the
ionosphere, unlike conventional radars, whose beams are limited to
line of sight. Return signals reach massive antennas and generate
computer radar pictures of targets between 500 and 2,000 miles
distant.
   Pentagon officials say the system's computers then would be able
to feed tactical information on drug targets to law enforcement
intelligence centers.
   The central-southwest sector would be located in North Dakota,
South Dakota and Minnesota.

<HEAD>Albanians In Kosovo Said To Forsake Blood Vengeance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a village in Kosovo province,
tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians gathered to formally renounce
the practice of seeking blood vengeance against rival families,
Tanjug reported.
   The previously unannounced gathering Tuesday proceeded without
major incidents or police intervention, the state news agency said.
   Kosovo repeatedly has seen clashes between the southern
province's ethnic Albanian majority, which seeks greater autonomy,
and massive security forces sent in to protect the Slav minority
from alleged Albanian harassment.
   Tanjug said the ethnic Albanians waved flags without the
Communist symbol of a five-pointed star, and shouted at any member
of Kosovo's Serb minority passing by.
   The gathering in the village of Gornja Luka, close to
neighboring Communist Albania, was the second such meeting in the
past month in Kosovo.
   The tradition of ``blood vengeance'' dates from the Middle Ages
and binds the head of an ethnic Albanian family to claim blood if a
family member is attacked by any member of a rival family.
   Reconciliation is usually completed with the head of the family
claiming blood vowing not to seek fresh blood. Women are exempt
from blood vengeance, and traditionally have taken over the field
work of any male relatives who feared their lives were in danger,
and thus stayed inside family quarters.
   Tanjug estimated Tuesday's crowd at 100,000. Other sources who
asked not to be identified estimated the number at tens of
thousands.
   Tanjug said thousands of car, tractors, trucks, buses and cattle
drawn carts clogged the roads around Gornja Luka from early morning
until early afternoon.
   State-run television and radio made no mention of the ceremony,
and it was not clear how many ethnic Albanian families buried their
feuds at the gathering.

   Suspicious fires destroyed or damaged 32 cars at a
parking lot near the New Tokyo International Airport before dawn
today, and police blamed radical leftists opposed to the airport's
expansion.
   Incendiary devices were found under the burned vehicles at a
private lot about 3 miles north of the airport, said a local police
officer. No injuries were reported.
   ``Judging from the circumstances, we suspect the fire was caused
by radical extremists,'' said the officer, who requested anonymity.
   The airport, in Narita, is 40 miles northeast of Tokyo and many
of the 68 cars at the lot were owned by travelers using the airport.
   The government plans to build a terminal and two new runways by
the end of March 1991 to ease overcrowding and meet demands for
more flights.
   Radicals have resisted plans to expropriate farmland to expand
the airport, which opened in 1978. Eight farmers living on the
expansion site refuse to leave.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Quayle Learns International Diplomacy on the Fly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle, who came to the job
with his resume blank on foreign affairs, is learning international
diplomacy on the fly. Literally.
   Quayle is outpacing President Bush in foreign travel. And that
says a lot, since Bush _ who has been to 17 countries since taking
office _ has traveled more than any previous U.S. president at a
comparable time in his term.
   With Bush preoccupied with the upcoming Soviet and seven-nation
economic summits and with events in Eastern Europe and on the
hostage front, Quayle has been landing one foreign assignment after
the other.
   Just back from Nicaragua and Mexico, Quayle will be in the air
again next week with stops in Rome, London and Paris for
festivities honoring the late President Eisenhower. Italy, Britain
and France are countries Nos. 23-25 on Quayle's vice presidential
passport.
   That's a lot of globe-trotting for a former Indiana senator who,
aides say, doesn't like to travel.
   Quayle has just completed a major mission: a series of goodwill
trips to mend fences with Latin American leaders uneasy over last
December's U.S. invasion of Panama.
   In the process, he visited 14 Latin American countries and began
establishing his credentials as a specialist on the region at a
time of dramatic change.
   Quayle's performance as a goodwill ambassador in Latin America
has won praise from senior White House officials and from many
lawmakers, including Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., who
accompanied Quayle on one of the trips.
   That's not to say that Quayle's visits have all been studies in
smooth execution and good timing.
   For instance:
   _In Managua for the inauguration of President Violeta Chamorro,
Quayle found himself short-handed when trucks bearing 1,000 tons of
U.S. flour and vegetable oil didn't make it from Honduras in time
for a kick-off food-distribution ceremony. He had to make do with
the few bags of flour and cans of oil his delegation brought that
morning from Washington.
   _In Paraguay, Quayle joyfully accepted on behalf of the National
Zoo a gift of two prized jaguars, only to discover they were on the
U.S. endangered species list. The cats stayed in Paraguay.
   _His goodwill tour ended on a frosty note last week with a
tongue-lashing in Mexico from President Carlos Salinas, who
registered anger at the abduction to the United States of a Mexican
doctor accused in the 1985 slaying of a U.S. drug enforcement agent.
   _Then there was the matter of the doll. Quayle' purchase _ over
wife Marilyn's protests _ of an X-rated wooden doll in Valparaiso,
Chile, was widely reported, making Quayle the brunt of many
Washington jokes.
   ``The problem with Quayle and the image business is every time
he makes a miscue, you know it's going to be grist for late-night
TV comedians,'' said Stephen Hess, a specialist on the presidency
with the Brookings Institution.
   Still, Hess said Quayle's performance has helped counter his
image as young and immature.
   ``As he travels and is perceived as someone with international
experience, it has to rebound to his benefit,'' Hess said. ``He can
now talk with some confidence about other parts of the world, about
world leaders.''
   Quayle seems less confident when he deals with some areas of the
world.
   For instance, in a recent speech, he urged Israel to ``commit
itself'' to the Arrow anti-missile missile being developed by U.S.
and Israeli scientists.
   But when asked by members of the audience to elaborate, Quayle
simply repeated the words of his speech. He denied that the level
of U.S. funding was an obstacle to the project _ even though
officials on both sides say funding is one of the main problems.
   And his office had to scramble on March 26 when a Soviet
official quoted Quayle to support the Kremlin's crackdown on
Lithuanian army deserters. Quayle had said ``a certain element of
discipline'' was needed in any armed force. Quayle aides insisted
the Soviets took the remarks out of context.
   Quayle still has a way to go to close in on Bush's frequent
flier record as vice president _ 76 countries. But Bush took eight
years to accumulate that, and Quayle's only been in office a little
more than 15 months.
   In addition to his foreign travel, Quayle has been to 40 states
as vice president. He will be on the road 19 days this month alone.
   Does Dan Quayle enjoy all the travel? ``He doesn't,'' said
spokesman David Beckwith. ``He likes to be home with his family.''

<HEAD>Exxon Moves Cleanup Crews into Alaska; Chemicals Given the OK</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN ENDERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exxon workers hitting Alaska's beaches
for a second summer of cleanup got approval from Gov. Steve Cowper
to use potentially toxic fertilizer to remove oil. ``Everything's
dead anyway,'' he said.
   About 100 Exxon workers in five teams Tuesday were sent to pick
up oily debris on the shoreline in Prince William Sound. Three more
squads of 20 to 50 each will go out later this week, said Exxon
spokesman Jim Robertson.
   The cleanup from Exxon's March 1989 spill of nearly 11 million
gallons of North Slope crude was suspended in September. The
nation's biggest oil spill killed hundreds of otters and thousands
of birds and other animals. More than 200 miles of shoreline still
have some oil, according to an Exxon survey.
   State officials decided Tuesday to permit extensive use of
fertilizers along the Prince William Sound shoreline. The urea- and
phosphorous-based fertilizer speeds the growth of bacteria known to
eat oil.
   ``We know direct application of these chemicals will have a
toxic effect,'' Cowper said. ``But the flip side is these beaches
have been heavily oiled and everything's dead anyway.''
   Alaska's Department of Environmental Conservation had balked at
the process, known as bioremediation. Environmentalists, fishing
groups and recreational users of the Sound had expressed concern
that incorrect application of the fertilizer could produce unwanted
slime.
   Exxon has said it wants to use bioremediation on 160 of the 209
sites it had surveyed by last week.
   The state dropped its hesitation over the technique after
reviewing Environmental Protection Agency data on toxicity and the
effectiveness of Inipol, a French-made fertilizer developed
especially for oily shores.
   Fertilizers will be used carefully to avoid exposure to mammals
and will be monitored daily and reviewed in six weeks for
effectiveness, officials said.
   Oily tar balls will be removed bhy hand on environmentally
sensitive shores, said Coast Guard Rear Adm. David Ciancaglini, the
government's on-scene coordinator for the cleanup.
   Priority will be given areas considered important for recreation
and commercial fishing, officials said.
   Cowper said relations between the state and Exxon Corp. have
improved significantly this year.
   ``Last summer we often had to rely on confrontational press in
order to generate any kind of action,'' the governor said. ``I
think a lot of the rough spots have been cleared away.''

   Resorts on opposite sides of the
continent are battling to build the world's longest sand sculpture
in a down and dirty fight.
   ``We shall fight them on the airwaves. We shall fight them in
the newspapers. Most importantly, we shall fight them on the
beaches,'' proclaimed a group of civic leaders in the tiny resort
community of Long Beach, Wash.
   A similar coalition of civic leaders in Myrtle Beach, S.C.,
issued a declaration of war.
   Last June, about 2,000 people carved a world-record sand
sculpture 15,063 feet long at Myrtle Beach. But the record fell in
July when Long Beach sculpted a sea serpent of 16,040 feet _ just
over three miles long.
   Myrtle Beach hopes to reclaim the record in a one-day attempt on
June 1, while Long Beach, a community of about 1,300 year-round
residents, begins work on a new sculpture May 31.
   Even before the first sand is turned, the contest has turned
gritty.
   Both cities have toll-free hotlines to muster support for the
battle and officials in Myrtle Beach, which has a year-round
population of 60,000, hope 5,000 will take part.
   Long Beach expects about 1,500, but that doesn't concern City
Manager Nabiel Shawa.
   ``One rugged Northwestern sand castle builder is worth a dozen
East Coasters,'' he said.

   All dressed up with no place to go, a covey
of cab drivers looked on as city officials hailed a new cabbie
dress code.
   ``What we have tried to do is make sure that cab drivers are
clean and neat, and that they don't have objectionable odors,''
City Councilman Joel Wachs told reporters at a downtown taxi stand.
   Effective Tuesday, the ordinance forbids cab drivers from
wearing tank tops, cut-off shorts and dirty clothes. White socks
are out. Thongs are out. Chest hair, displayed beyond the second
button, is out.
   Fines for dress code violations will be assessed by Traffic
Department inspectors to taxicab companies under a complex formula
that allows each company to amass a certain number of points before
penalties would be imposed.
   Hollywood fashion arbiter Mr. Blackwell said in a telephone
interview that he welcomed the change.
   ``I'm a little tired of getting into a cab, and they show up in
an undershirt, and they've got armpits hanging out,'' Mr. Blackwell
said.
   The cab drivers who watched the news event said they generally
accepted the dress code, although a few objected.
   Nicolas Castellanos, wearing a red satin tie with an L.A. Taxi
logo, shrugged as he said, ``If you don't like to dress well,
you're never going to do it.''

   The Metropolitan Opera's last ``Die Walkure'' of
the season was presented with new singers in the two leading
soprano roles.
   The opera's two scheduled sopranos were felled, one of them
literally.
   Hildegarde Behrens, scheduled to sing Brunnhilde, was hit on the
head by a falling piece of scenery near the end of
``Gotterdammerung'' Saturday night.
   Jessye Norman, scheduled to sing Sieglinde, was ill.
   Both were replaced Tuesday night by their ``covers,'' the singer
standing by in case she's needed to perform.
   Gudrun Volkert made her Metropolitan Opera debut as Brunnhilde.
She has a beautiful middle range but her top notes aren't produced
easily. Miss Volkert, who was born in Brno, Czechoslovakia, has
sung Brunnhilde in seven European opera houses. She is tall and
very thin.
   Hanna Lisowska of Warsaw, Poland, made her Met debut on April 21
as Gutrune in ``Gotterdammerung.'' She proved more of a
disappointment, possibly partly because the audience expected not
to hear Hildegarde Behrens but thought it was going to hear the
lush vocal outpouring of Jessye Norman.
   Miss Lisowska has a smaller voice and was singing with two
big-voiced men.
   Gary Lakes was in good voice as Siegmund, sounding warm and
heroic. Matti Salminen as Hunding made his bass notes round, hollow
and ominous.
   Miss Lisowska sang a competent Sieglinde but didn't make a
listener's heart beat faster.
   James Morris was remarkable as Wotan, singing the long part with
nuance and power, never tiring.
   Christa Ludwig sounded splendid as Fricka. As she left the
stage, Maestro James Levine blew her a kiss. A program note said,
``This performance celebrates the 30th anniversary of Christa
Ludwig's Metropolitan Opera debut.''
   The Ring cycle operas aren't being presented at the Met next
season. It's possible that Miss Ludwig may not sing Fricka at the
Met again.
   Levine made instrumental tempos and Wotan's Act 2 monologue to
Brunnhilde unusually slow. Sometimes during the evening, tempos
were brisk.
   Miss Behrens and her doctor have not decided whether she'll be
able to sing Brunnhilde in Thursday's ``Siegfried'' or in
``Gotterdammerung'' on Saturday.

<HEAD>Congressman Takes Up Case of Scientist Accused of Nazi Brutality</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An Ohio congressman is taking up the case of a
German rocket scientist who worked for the United States after
World War II but was later accused of having brutalized prisoners
in Nazi slave labor camps.
   Rep. James Traficant is collecting files and information about
Arthur Rudolph, who surrendered his American citizenship and left
the United States in 1984 under an agreement with the U.S.
government.
   Traficant ``believes pressure was put on Arthur Rudolph to
renounce his citizenship,'' H. West Richards, a spokesman for the
maverick Democrat, said Tuesday. He said the lawmaker will address
supporters of Rudolph next week in Huntsville, Ala.
   Traficant's interest in the case appears to stem from his
campaign against the Justice Department's Office of Special
Investigations, a unit that hunts suspected Nazis.
   He has sharply criticized the office for trying to discredit
some witnesses in the case of John Demjanjuk, a retired
Cleveland-area auto worker on death row in Israel after being
convicted of committing Nazi atrocities.
   ``He believes they use questionable methods,'' said Richards.
   But Neal Sher, head of the OSI, said, ``It is absurd for anyone
to claim that Rudolph was pressured or forced into renouncing his
citizenship and leaving this country.''
   ``The case against Rudolph was made in large measure by his own
admissions. The fact is Rudolph simply did not want to be
confronted with the damning evidence against him,'' Sher said.
   Rudolph, who joined the Nazi party in 1931, was production
manager of a V-2 rocket factory attached to the Dora-Nordhausen
concentration camp. He told OSI investigators that he knew camp
prisoners he picked to work in the underground factory died of
maltreatment, transcripts show.
   Rudolph was brought here along with more than 100 other German
technicians and scientists after World War II to help the United
States develop space and armament programs. He went to work for the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, becoming the manager
of the Saturn 5 rocket program that sent astronauts to the moon in
1969.
   Now 84, he lives in Hamburg, West Germany.
   In the agreement he signed, the OSI said Rudolph ``participated,
under the direction of and on behalf of the Nazi government in
Germany, in the persecution of unarmed civilians because of their
race, religion, national origin or political opinion.''
   Rudolph said in the agreement, a copy of which was obtained by
The Associated Press, that he was familiar with the allegations and
did not contest them. He also acknowledged that ``my U.S.
citizenship was illegally procured and ... were I a non-U.S.
citizen, I concede that I would be deportable ....''
   The OSI is looking into the files of other former participants
in the rocket program to see if any of them lied about their past
and could be stripped of their citizenship, said one official,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Rudolph's supporters in Alabama, some of them former German
colleagues, maintain that he served the United States loyally, and
when he was no longer needed, he was intimidated and harassed until
he left the country.
   ``Mr. Traficant is the one man in Congress who has opened his
eyes to the methods used by the OSI and called them into
question,'' said the invitation issued by Friends of Arthur Rudolph
to the May 12 event.
   ``He is coming to Huntsville because he ... wants to share his
views with Rudolph's friends and all who are concerned with justice
and fair play,'' the organizers wrote.
   Traficant prides himself of running against the pack. Several
months ago he accused the CIA of failing to reveal that it knew in
advance that Pan American Flight 103, that exploded over Scotland
in December 1988, might have had a bomb aboard.
   A federal appeals court has ruled that Traficant owes the
government more than $280,000 in back taxes, penalties and interest
on a bribe he allegedly received as an Ohio sheriff.

   ``Caroline?'' on struggling CBS emerged the
winner as the big three networks jumped into the spring sweeps
season with competing made-for-TV movies.
   In Sunday night's TV movie free-for-all, Jim and Tammy Bakker's
``Fall From Grace'' on NBC didn't have a prayer against
``Caroline?'' the story of a woman supposedly dead who tries to
convince her family she's very much alive.
   ``Caroline?'' _ starring Stephanie Zimbalist _ ranked fifth,
pushing CBS into the top 10 for the first time in three weeks.
``Fall From Grace'' ranked eighth.
   ABC's ``Summer Dreams: The Story of the Beach Boys'' wiped out
in the same time slot, coming in 48th according to figures Tuesday
from the A.C. Nielsen Co.
   CBS remains in the ratings basement but got a boost at the right
time _ the ratings during the sweeps period help set local
stations' advertising rates.
   For the week ended April 29, NBC was still the No. 1 network,
with an average of 12.9, followed by ABC with 11.4 and CBS with
11.1. Each ratings point represents 921,000 households.
   CBS also got a boost with Monday night's broadcast of the pilot
for ``I Love Lucy'' _ a never-before-seen episode made in 1951. It
had been lost nearly four decades. Preliminary estimates released
Tuesday showed ``I Love Lucy: The Very First Show'' winning its
time slot with a 21.7 average.
   ABC's ``America's Funniest Home Videos'' was the top-ranked show
for last week, followed by NBC's beer-drinking customers on
``Cheers'' and the college kids of ``A Different World,'' also on
NBC.
   Fox's ``The Simpsons'' finished 13th, despite some school
principals having a cow this week over spiky-headed, 10-year-old
anti-hero Bart Simpson, whose T-shirts read ``Under-achiever and
proud of it, man.''
   Here are the top 10 shows, their network and rating:
   ``America's Funniest Home Videos,'' ABC, 22; ``Cheers,'' NBC,
21.2; ``A Different World,'' NBC, 19.5; ``Caroline?'' Sunday night
movie, CBS, 19.4; ``The Cosby Show,'' NBC, 19.2; ``Roseanne,'' ABC,
tied with ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 18.4; ``Fall From Grace,'' Sunday
night movie, NBC, tied with ``Wings,'' NBC, 17.6, and ``Unsolved
Mysteries,'' NBC, 17.5.
   In the network news battle, ABC and Peter Jennings led with a
9.5. CBS and Dan Rather finished second with an 8.4, followed by
Tom Brokaw and NBC with a 7.8.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   What's the good word? According to the American
Dental Association, it's ``jussive'' or maybe ``grisaille.''
   A three-member team from the ADA spelled those words, as well as
some others like ``cataclasm,'' ``oubliette'' and ``bireme,'' to
beat 49 other corporate teams in an adults-only spelling bee.
   The ADA team spent nearly three hours late Tuesday beating out
the rest of the top 20 teams in the second annual Olsten Corporate
Great Grown-Up Spelling Bee _ an event that raised an estimated
$20,000 for the Literacy Volunteers of Chicago.
   Officials said it was about 10 percent of the annual budget for
the volunteers, who teach reading to adults.
   ``It's funny, but since we made the finals last week, we've been
saying, `What's the word for today?' whenever we meet in the
elevator or in the cafeteria, and someone always suggests some
obscure word,'' said ADA team member David Curry, 48.
   ``A couple of days ago, I asked the question, and someone said,
`grisaille.'''
   Someone else who said ``grisaille'' was Indianapolis newsman
Lloyd A. Anderson, the pronouncer who conducted the spelling bee.
He said it first to a three-man team from Van Kampen Merritt, an
investment house, who misspelled it ``griseille.''
   Curry and his teammates, Sheila Cassella and Lois Schuhrke,
spelled it right, which led to ``jussive'' and the championship.
   A grisaille, by the way, is a monochromatic painting, usually
done in shades of gray. ``Jussive'' means ``expressing or having
the effect of a command,'' a cataclasm is a breaking down or
disruption, an oubliette is a type of dungeon, and a bireme is an
ancient ship with banks of oars on two levels.
   The winners were actually members of the ADA's ``Team No. 2.''
ADA ``Team No. 1'' was the first team eliminated Tuesday,
misspelling ``cummerbund'' in the first round.
   The Van Kampen Merritt team, Jack Pace, Ray Hoffman and Rudy
Wright, finished second.
   They were almost eliminated in an early round when they
misspelled ``beneficent'' but were allowed back in on a protest
when the judges ruled that Anderson had pronounced it in a
misleading manner.
   ``I've conducted more than 450 spelling bees over the last 25
years, and I'll keep on doing it until I get it right,'' Anderson
said.
   A team from the First National Bank of Chicago finished third.
   As bankers, they had no problem with ``forecloseable.'' They
also managed words like ``perquisite,'' ``ostentatiously'' and
``schuss,'' but ``shih tzu,'' a small Chinese dog, spelled their
``Waterloo.''
   The team from the Chicago Tribune, once the home of simplified
spellings such as ``altho,'' ``thru'' and ``burocrat,'' lasted
until the final rounds, correctly spelling words like ``misogyny,''
``panegyrical'' and ``contumacious.''
   What nailed the newsmen was a word that doesn't show up often in
newspaper copy _ ``bombilation,'' defined as ``a buzzing, droning
sound.''
   The champions said they came by their spelling proficiency
through their work.
   ``My title is manager of educational services for the department
of professional relations, but basically I'm a speechwriter,'' said
Curry. ``I work with words.''
   Ms. Schuhrke, 45, is assistant secretary for the Council on
Dental Education and said she prepared for the finals ``by going to
dinner in Minneapolis and staying up late.''
   ``I'm a proofreader, what more can I say?'' asked Ms. Cassella,
39. ``Actually, though, I'm a literacy volunteer myself, and
teaching another adult who can't read makes you think a lot about
the English language.''

   Michael Sancilio's little sister
represents the 4-year-old boy's best, and perhaps only, hope for
life.
   Doctors on Tuesday drew blood from the girl's umbilical cord
during birth in hopes of using it to save her leukemia-stricken
brother.
   The blood was rushed to Indiana University to see if it matches
Michael's. If so, scientists will try for the first time to use the
unique cells of umbilical cord blood to grow healthy bone marrow in
a leukemia patient.
   It will be several days before doctors know if there is a match,
the chances of which were rated by doctors at 1-in-4.
   In March, Michael was diagnosed with chronic myelogenous
leukemia, a rare, incurable form of the disease that strikes fewer
than 1 percent of childhood leukemia victims, said Dr. Stephen
Rodgers, the family's pediatrician. Children with the disease
generally survive less than a year after diagnosis, he said.
   Leukemia patients normally are treated with bone marrow
transplants. But because time is short and the chances of finding a
compatible donor are 1-in-20,000, doctors are attempting the new
treatment.
   On Tuesday, doctors at Virginia Beach General Hospital took the
first step in delivering Christina Grace Sancilio by Caesarean
section. They clamped off the umbilical cord and removed about a
cup of umbilical cord blood.
   Rodgers said umbilical blood contains special cells called stem
cells that develop bone marrow in babies in their first nine months.
   If Christina's blood matches Michael's, the cells will be grown
at the university, which pioneered the procedure for the treatment
of some forms of anemia. Once scientists have grown a sheet of the
cells, they will inject them into Michael's heart after his
diseased bone marrow has been killed by radiation.
   The new cells, in theory, will act as they do in a newborn,
heading straight for the bone to produce bone marrow.
   With sons Michael and Tony in his arms, Anthony Sancilio, 35,
tried to express his joy and hope at seeing his daughter. ``I'm
speechless,'' he said. ``I'm thankful the baby is healthy and
hopeful that we will have a match.''
   Tests on 7-year-old Tony showed he was not a compatible donor
for his brother.
   Dr. Leslie L. Wasserman, who delivered both Christina and
Michael, said the collection of blood went smoothly, though the
surgical team had to make sure none of the mother's blood was mixed
with the umbilical cord blood.
   Wasserman said a Caesarean section was undertaken because of
33-year-old Denise Sancilio's difficulties in delivering Michael.
He said mother and baby are doing fine.
   The procedure has been done twice before to treat forms of
anemia. Because it has never been tried on a leukemia patient,
doctors are unsure what to expect.
   ``This is most likely his only chance,'' Rodgers said. ``It's
all going to take several months, and Michael will be close to the
end of his disease when we try the transfusion.''
   Even if the procedure is successful, Rodgers said, the child
faces a lifetime of treatment to ensure the body does not reject
the new bone marrow.

<HEAD>Senate Urges Halt to US-Soviet Trade Agreement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate, upset over President Bush's
decision not to punish the Soviet Union for its actions in
Lithuania, is urging him to put the brakes on a new U.S.-Soviet
trade agreement.
   By a 73-24 vote, the Senate passed a resolution Tuesday seeking
a halt to any trade agreement that would grant the Soviet Union
lower tariffs as long as the crackdown on Lithuania continues.
   The non-binding resolution urges Bush not to act on any trade
agreements until the Soviets lift their economic blockade against
Lithuania and enter into negotiations aimed at independence for the
republic.
   In a political twist, the measure was introduced by a fellow
Republican _ Sen. Alfonse D'Amato of New York _ and supported by
most GOP senators. Only Republican Sens. John Warner of Virginia
and Alan Simpson of Wyoming voted against the measure.
   The measure also split Democrats, with Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell of Maine supporting it and Sen. Claiborne Pell of
Rhode Island, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
opposing it.
   Bush decided last week not to take any action against Moscow for
its blockade against the Baltic republic, where a new non-communist
parliament declared Lithuania independent on March 11.
   The president's go-slow approach has drawn widespread criticism
from members of Congress, particularly from those with large
Lithuanian-American communities in their districts.
   Mitchell called for Bush to ``clearly demonstrate'' that the
United States supports a free and independent Lithuania and opposes
the Soviet economic sanctions.
   ``It would be unfortunate for all if the United States fails to
make this position clear,'' he said.
   The Bush administration on April 26 announced ``substantial
agreement'' with the Soviet Union on a trade agreement that would
clear the way for the Soviets to obtain significantly lower tariffs
on goods they sell in the United States. Officials expect the
treaty to be ready for signing at the May 30-June 3 U.S.-Soviet
summit in Washington, and it also must be ratified by Congress.
   ``Some of us feel that we are slipping and sliding into `most
favored nation' status with the Soviet Union, while they are still
taking aggressive, oppressive actions in the Baltic countries,''
said Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.
   Secretary of State James Baker III said completion of the
outline of a new agreement did not mean Bush would recommend to
Congress a one-year waiver of high U.S. tariffs.
   But he said the U.S.-Soviet relationship ran deeper than the
Lithuanian independence issue. ``We have a lot of interests at
stake here that are very important interests to the United States
of America,'' Baker said.
   Meantime, the White House announced that Bush will meet with
Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene on Thursday.
   Ms. Prunskiene, an economist, is coming to the United States on
a private visit, said Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman.
   She also will meet with State Department officials and members
of Congress and will speak Friday at the National Press Club.
   Fitzwater called the meeting with Ms. Prunskiene ``a rare
opportunity to get a firsthand analysis of the situation.'' He
stressed, however, that Bush has not changed policy on Lithuania.

   The Apollo capsule in which three astronauts
died 23 years ago will be entombed with the debris of the space
shuttle Challenger in an abandoned missile silo.
   The remnants of the capsule will be transferred from the Langley
Research Center in Hampton, Va., to the Cape Canaveral Air Force
Station in Florida about May 20, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration said Tuesday.
   Astronauts Virgil ``Gus'' Grissom, Roger B. Chaffee and Edward
H. White II died when fire flared through the capsule during a
countdown rehearsal for the first manned Apollo mission.
   The fire, in a cabin filled with 100 percent oxygen, was
triggered by a spark when a broken or bruised wire beneath
Grissom's couch contacted metal. The astronauts were trapped by a
wall of flame and died within seconds.
   Grissom and Chaffee are buried side by side at Arlington
National Cemetery, White at West Point, N.Y.
   The spacecraft has been kept in a container along with its heat
shield, other hardware and investigative data at Langley, as
directed by a board that investigated the fire.
   ``The container has been deteriorating and several small leaks
have developed,'' NASA said. ``Routine repairs were made to the
container, but due to its age it cannot be effectively maintained
on a continuing basis.''
   The remnants of the Challenger, which exploded after liftoff
Jan. 28, 1986, were placed in the missile silo at the Cape
Canaveral base after investigators were finished with them.
   NASA said the Apollo debris, including investigation data, take
up about 3,300 feet of storage.

<HEAD>Panama-Nicaragua Aid Bill Heads to Conference Committee</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A spending bill containing $720 million in
``emergency'' aid for Nicaragua and Panama is headed for
House-Senate negotiations after senators added a sharp warning
against Soviet punishment of Lithuania.
   The Senate late Tuesday approved its $3.4 billion version of the
spending package on a voice vote, sending it to a conference with
the House that could begin as early as Thursday. The House passed
its $2.4 billion measure on April 3.
   Both bills include $420 million in aid President Bush sought for
the new government in Panama and $300 million for Nicaragua's new
democracy.
   But both versions took on dozens of additional provisions as
they moved through the legislative process, raising numerous
difficult issues. For example, the Senate bill includes language
permitting the District of Columbia to use local money to pay for
abortions for poor women, and Bush has vowed a veto if it remains
in the bill.
   There also is likely to be a squabble over terms for $400
million in loan guarantees for Israel to build housing for Soviet
emigres. The Senate version waives about $25 million in
administrative fees, while the House version allows the full fees
to be charged.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said he supported the
guarantees but voiced concern over Israeli moves to place new
settlers in the occupied territories and questioned whether
concessions should be made.
   ``What is the justification?'' Dole asked, for waiving fees and
other normal program requirements.
   ``We also have countless tens of thousands of homeless in this
country,'' he said. ``We don't hear their voice much, but they
might ask, `What about us?'''
   Another difference is in the Lithuania provision. On Tuesday,
the Senate voted 73-24 for a non-binding provision urging Bush not
to send Congress a U.S.-Soviet trade agreement for approval until
Moscow rescinds economic sanctions against the independence-minded
Baltic republic.
   In addition to foreign aid and $70 million for refugee programs
Bush had sought, the bill became the vehicle for a long list of
unrelated provisions. Lawmakers added hundreds of millions of
dollars for disaster relief, fighting forest fires, food stamps,
veterans' benefits and other domestic programs.
   Most of the spending would be offset by cuts in this year's
Pentagon budget, representing the first major application of a
``peace dividend'' from reduced East-West tensions.
   Padding of a supplemental spending bill is common, but Bush
complained about it on Tuesday, saying, ``None of it related to
Nicaragua, none of it related to Panama; all of it related to other
priorities they had.''
   Panamanian President Guillermo Endara, in a speech at the
National Press Club, was more understanding. ``This is the price we
pay for democracy,'' he said. ``It's the best system ... and we
want a democracy, (even) with all the delays.''
   Endara said his country would use the $420 million to rebuild
its battered economy and repair damage from the December U.S.
invasion, which installed him in power. But he said Panama will not
ask for more U.S. economic aid next year.
   By using part of the money to pay off past-due loans to
international banks, Panama would again become eligible to meet
future financial needs through new development loans, he said.

<TEXT>
   Member of Congress are protesting President
Bush's willingness to see L. William Seidman, the straight-talking
boss of the administration's savings and loan bailout, quit before
his term expires.
   ``There are problems with the savings and loan bailout, but you
don't solve that problem by shooting the messenger,'' said Rep.
Bruce Vento, D-Minn., chairman of a House task force overseeing the
cleanup. ``We need more qualified individuals ... and fewer
political `yes' men.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater indicated Tuesday that
Bush would not resist a move by Seidman, 69, to leave before the
October 1991 expiration of his term as chairman of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Resolution Trust Corp.
   The FDIC manages deposit insurance funds for banks and S&amp;Ls,
while the RTC conducts the administration's thrift bailout.
   ``Bill has indicated he's not going to stay the whole term, and
we are interested in getting new leadership there that would carry
on an aggressive program when the time comes,'' Fitzwater said.
   However, he denied a report in The Washington Post that Bush
suggested in a meeting with the regulator two weeks ago that this
would be a good time for him to leave. The newspaper quoted two
unidentified administration sources.
   ``The president has not asked him to leave or suggested a
specific departure,'' the spokesman said.
   Seidman, appointed by then-President Reagan in 1985, has made no
secret of his desire to leave before the end of his term. However,
despite periodic feuding with White House chief of staff John
Sununu and Deputy Treasury Secretary John Robson, he had given no
indication his departure was imminent.
   Reached by telephone from his hometown, Grand Rapids, Mich.,
where he was accepting a business award, Seidman declined to
comment on the Post story or on his plans for the future.
   However, he noted that he has said he planned to leave after
getting the bailout agency off to a good start. A month ago, he
announced ambitious plans to sell or close 140 S&amp;Ls by the end of
June and, he said Tuesday, ``That would be a good start.''
   Although he has riled administration officials with his
independent ways, Seidman gets high marks on Capitol Hill for
steering the FDIC through the unprecedented failure of more than
800 banks during his term and for his candor about the S&amp;L
industry's problems.
   ``Almost alone, he has been a tell-it-like-it-is,
play-it-like-he-sees-it kind of guy,'' said Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa,
a senior member of the House Banking Committee. ``But what is
refreshing frankness to some on Capitol Hill has been grating on
the nerves of some in Treasury and perhaps in the bowels of the
White House.''
   Twenty-four House Democrats, in a letter circulated by Rep.
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., called on Bush to urge Seidman to stay.
They said his departure would paralyze the administration's bailout
effort.
   ``It is intolerable that Chairman Seidman's early departure may
be the result of his frustration with the internal bickering,
bureaucratic interference and turf battles that have marked the
first nine months of the thrift bailout effort,'' the Democrats
wrote.
   Seidman's feud with Sununu dates to the first month of Bush's
term, when he skewered an administration proposal to charge bank
customers a fee for deposit insurance. He ridiculed the idea as the
``reverse toaster'' theory, in which the depositor would give the
bank a toaster to open an account.
   Most recently, Seidman has irked Treasury officials by warning
Congress that the administration likely will be forced to propose a
second installment of the bailout after this year's congressional
elections.
   Fitzwater said there has been no discussion of Seidman's
possible successor.
   Kenneth Guenther, executive vice president of the Independent
Bankers Association of America, said that one of the leading
candidates to replace Seidman is Comptroller of the Currency Robert
Clarke. Clarke's office regulates federally chartered banks and he
sits on the five-member FDIC board.

<HEAD>Fugitive From Kent State-Related Charges Doesn't Want to Come Home</HEAD>

   Joe Schock is still on the lam, two
decades after fleeing charges that he torched 29 National Guard
trucks and Jeeps in reaction to the killing of four Vietnam War
protesters at Kent State University.
   Yet, after an odyssey through the radical underground, Schock's
life has evolved into an existence similar to that he fled. Today
he is a paunchy suburban father of two daughters, teaching English
to young accountants in Paris.
   And, much to the sorrow of his family, the 42-year-old fugitive
vows never to return to the United States.
   ``I've gone down another road,'' he said in a recent telephone
interview with the Idahonian newspaper in Moscow, Idaho. ``I don't
feel good about the States. ... I don't want to re-adapt.''
   He is a free man in France, shielded from U.S. authorities by a
treaty that bars the extradition of political fugitives. He has
become a French citizen.
   Schock served as a Marine in Vietnam, but he returned with
growing doubts about his country's role. His skepticism intensified
after he joined anti-war groups at Idaho and Washington State
universities.
   On May 4, 1970, his parents and police say, the deaths at Kent
State led him to go to the Lewiston armory with bolt-cutters and
gasoline.
   ``He told me where the wire cutters and gloves were left, where
he left them,'' said Ed Schock, his father. ``I can't say if he was
alone, but I think he did it.''
   Police said a witness saw Schock toss an object over the armory
fence and run. Moments after a thunderous explosion, Schock flagged
down a car, but he was arrested at a roadblock, his clothes reeking
of gasoline, police said.
   Schock neither denies nor admits involvement with the sabotage.
``Some day I still may have to defend myself in a U.S. court,'' he
said.
   He fled the country in July 1970 while awaiting trial on federal
charges of destruction of property. His family did not hear from
him for two years.
   Schock's sister, Lois Gibbens of Pasco, Wash., has not seen him
since he left. His parents have visited him in France three times.
   ``It's a tragedy in our family,'' Gibbens said.
   Her brother agreed: ``My family most certainly has suffered from
my problems.''
   But Schock insisted he would not come home even if charges were
not hanging over him.
   ``If they could give me a job in Lewiston at $200,000 a year, I
wouldn't want to come home,'' he said. ``I don't want to be
dominated by that economic system.''
   Although a judge dismissed the indictment against Schock in
1979, prosecutors say it was merely a housekeeping chore to clear
the books of old cases. Prosecutors and Schock's lawyer, Carl
Maxey, agreed that charges could easily be reinstated.
   The charges carry up to 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
   Schock said he would not be received warmly by most Americans if
he came home.
   ``They'd still hold it against me,'' he said. ``They wouldn't
justify that kind of action.''

<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas attacked
strategic targets in the capital late Tuesday and automatic weapons
fire and explosions could be heard in several neighborhoods. Much
of the city was without power.
   There were no immediate reports of casualties.
   It appeared to be the most serious guerrilla attack since
November, when the rebels launched a huge monthlong offensive in
the capital.
   The rebels dynamited five high voltage utility towers along the
road leading north to the city of Chalatenango, leaving at least
half of San Salvador without electricity, the privately owned radio
station YSKL reported.
   The station said a rebel group also attacked an electricity
relay station north of the city on the slopes of San Salvador
volcano.
   The gunfire began around 10 p.m. and continued sporadically
until early Wednesday. Military helicopters could be heard buzzing
several areas of the capital.
   Guerrilla groups shot it out with government soldiers near the
former Sheraton Hotel in the western residential district of
Escalon and the gunfight spilled over into the Tasumal
neighborhood, residents there said.
   They said they heard automatic weapons fire and explosions that
could have been from hand grenades or missiles.
   Guerrillas also trained gunfire on the police academy on the
road to Santa Tecla, a small town 14 miles west of the capital, as
well as a civil defense post in the southern neighborhood of Costa
Rica, and the national elections board building in Escalon,
according to witnesses.
   The fighting broke out hours before President Alfredo
Cristiani's rightist government and the guerrillas' Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front were to hold indirect preliminary talks
on seeking an end to the war.
   A representative of U.N. general secretary Javier Perez de
Cuellar was due to arrive in San Salvador today to act as a
go-between in setting up an agenda and arranging other details for
the peace talks to begin.
   Two attempts to negotiate an end to the war ended in deadlock in
1984 and 1985, and a series of direct talks began shortly after
Cristiani was sworn in as president in July but broke off as a
result of the November offensive.
   More than 72,000 people have been killed, most of them
civilians, since the civil war began in October 1979.

<HEAD>Health-Care Discrepancies Between Blacks, Whites Unacceptable,
Doctors Say</HEAD>

   The short shrift that blacks and other racial
minorities get from the U.S. health-care system is intolerable and
must end, an ethics panel for the American Medical Association said
today.
   Studies dramatizing the disparities in medical treatment between
the races go back decades, but blacks are still getting less
frequent and less aggressive care, said the AMA Council on Ethical
and Judicial Affairs.
   ``Whether the racial disparities in treatment decisions are
caused by differences in incomes and education, socio-cultural
factors, or failures by the medical profession, they are
unjustified and must be eliminated,'' the council said.
   ``Not only do the disparities violate fundamental principles of
fairness, justice and medical ethics, they may be part of the
reason for the poorer quality of health of blacks in the United
States.''
   American blacks have twice the infant mortality rate of whites
and a life expectancy six years shorter, the panel said in a report
in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
   Black men under 45 years have a 45 percent higher rate of lung
cancer and 10 times the likelihood of dying from high blood
pressure than white men in the same age group, added the council.
   The panel said many of the disparities also exist for other
racial minorities but are less well-documented.
   The panel recommended a triple-barrel approach to improve health
care for blacks: greater access, greater awareness and concrete
medical guidelines for what is acceptable care.
   Ensuring greater access should include requiring employers to
provide health insurance to all their workers expanding Medicaid to
all Americans below the poverty level, the panel said.
   The panel called for a state role in helping the poor obtain
health insurance.
   Robert J. Blendon, chairman of the Department of Health Policy
and Management at Harvard School of Public Health, said the
recommendations, most of which the AMA already has made
individually, represent ``really a step out for an association that
has not taken a strong stand on this issue for many years.''
   The panel said studies that document disparities in U.S. medical
care have found the following:
   _While black men nationwide suffered a certain type of heart
attack at three-fourths the rate of white men, the blacks were only
half as likely to get special heart X-rays and only a third as
likely to undergo bypass surgery.
   _Although blacks accounted for 33 percent of Medicare patients
with end-stage kidney disease between 1977 and 1985, they accounted
for only 21 percent of kidney-transplant recipients.
   _Among pneumonia patients in 17 hospitals from 1970 to 1973,
blacks were less likely to receive medical services, particularly
intensive care.
   _Black patients surveyed by telephone in 1986 were more likely
than white patients ``to report that their physicians did not
inquire sufficiently about their pain, did not tell them how long
it would take for prescribed medicine to work, did not explain the
seriousness of their illness or injury and did not discuss test and
examination findings.''

<HEAD>Study: Research Into Ills That Disable the Elderly Can Save Money</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Finding ways to prevent and treat diseases
that disable the elderly can provide a cushion in the next century
when aging baby boomers are expected to push health care costs into
the sky, researchers say.
   While medical advances are keeping Americans alive longer, this
may mean that more people will be at risk of becoming disabled in
late life by such conditions as Alzheimer's disease and hip
fractures.
   ``We can't afford not to invest more now in research on aging,''
said Dr. Edward L. Schneider, dean of the University of Southern
California's Andrus Gerontology Center and coauthor of a study on
the impact of aging baby boomers could have on the nation's
heath-care system.
   The study, reported in this week's Journal of the American
Medical Association, projected that Medicare expenditures, which
were $71 billion in 1987, could soar as high as $212 billion in
2040, when the average age of a baby boomer is 85.
   Medicare costs for those 85 and older _ the fastest growing
segment of the U.S. population _ could grow sixfold, the study said.
   Nursing home costs, now $31 billion for 1.3 million patients,
could rise to as much as $139 billion with 5.9 million people
living in these facilities, the study estimated.
   The number of Americans with conditions like Alzheimer's disease
and hip fractures caused by osteoporosis, two of the biggest
contributors to nursing home admissions, could quadruple unless
ways are found to prevent or delay the onset of these conditions,
the study said.
   Research is also needed for other diseases that afflict the
elderly, including Parkinson's disease, osteoarthritis and vision
and hearing ailments, researchers said.
   ``This is where the challenge of aging (research) lies,'' said
Dr. Jack M. Guralnik, an epidemiologist at the government's
National Institute on Aging and coauthor of the report.
   Cost containment will not be enough to offset the huge increases
in health care that will be needed in the next century, the
researchers said.
   The greatest savings will be found in preventing and delaying
the onset of the debilitating diseases that rob the elderly of
their independence and force them to rely on others for care, they
said.
   A $1 billion annual investment in Alzheimer's research would
likely yield advances that could at least delay the onset of the
disease by a minimum of five years, which would save $500 billion
in care costs in the two decades from 2000-2020, Schneider said.
   The federal government is spending about $148 million this year
to research Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia.
   ``In the last 100 years, we have extended life expectancy 29
years, but we've done precious little research into how to make
those last 29 years quality years,'' Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said
at a briefing where the study was released on Tuesday.
   Harkin, chairman of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that
deals with medical research, said he will introduce legislation to
increase federal financing of aging research from the current $400
million to $1 billion annually.
   ``We're either going to invest now or pay later,'' he said.
   Joseph Califano Jr., once secretary of the old Department of
Health, Education and Welfare and a national spokesman for Project
Independence for Older Americans, said the study findings show that
``the most cost-effective research the United States can put money
into now is in aging'' research.

<HEAD>Government Plans to Restart Savannah River Reactor in December</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nuclear weapons reactors shut down for nearly
two years because of safety and environmental concerns would resume
production early next year under a new Energy Department schedule.
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins, announcing the planned
restart of three reactors at the Savannah River plant in South
Carolina, said his department also is reviewing a proposal to
resume production this summer of plutonium warhead triggers at its
Rocky Flats plant in Colorado.
   ``At this time, there does not seem to be any alternative for
the nation other than keeping Rocky Flats on line to deal with
warhead management,'' Watkins told a Senate Armed Services
subcommittee Tuesday.
   He said the department plans to restart its K reactor at the
Savannah River plant in December and, after a period of low-power
testing, begin producing tritium for nuclear weapons in January.
   The P and L reactors at Savannah River would be restarted in
March and September 1991, respectively, with production of weapons
components from each to resume a month after their start-up,
Watkins said.
   All three reactors at Savannah River have been shut down since
mid-1988 and operations at the Rocky Flats plant were suspended
last November, bringing the restocking of the nation's strategic
weapons stockpile to a halt.
   Watkins said the government has spent $7.5 billion in the past
three years on modernizing the Savannah River and Rocky Flats
facilities to bring them up to current environmental and safety
standards.
   Environmentalists and anti-nuclear activists _ particularly
those living near the plants _ called for a continued moratorium
and have vowed to fight reopening the plants in court.
   ``Several unresolved issues relating to restart of the Savannah
River reactors remain on the table. It's much too soon for
Secretary Watkins to announce a restart schedule,'' said Brian
Costner, director of the Energy Research Foundation of Columbia,
S.C., an environmental group.
   But Watkins expressed confidence his department can now defeat
any legal challenges, saying it will release draft environmental
impact statements this Friday on the resumed operation of the
Savannah River reactors.
   ``A month ago, for the first time, I began to feel comfortable
about Savannah River,'' he told the strategic forces and nuclear
deterrence subcommittee. ``I hadn't felt that way before.
Everything has turned around down there.''
   Although the department and appointed outside experts have not
yet completed their reviews and approved the schedule for resuming
operations at Rocky Flats, Watkins said he anticipates making a
formal announcement on it next month.
   He also said he was looking at opening the Waste Isolation Pilot
Plant in New Mexico to its first shipment of military nuclear
wastes in October or November.
   He said he envisions only a ``very modest amount of ... wastes''
moving to the New Mexico site initially, primarily for research
testing its suitability as a permanent burial ground for such
wastes.
   Despite lingering environmental concerns, senators at the
hearing agreed that the United States cannot afford to continue
forestalling a resumption of weapons production.
   ``I wish I could say we don't need any production of weapons
material,'' said the subcommittee's chairman, Sen. J. James Exon,
D-Neb. ``That is not the case. The Soviet Union is going to be
relying on its nuclear deterrent as a strategy more than ever
before.''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said the Soviets have 11
weapons production reactors in operation, including three for
making plutonium, despite a ``marginally greater'' stockpile of
plutonium than the United States.
   ``They have the capability to turn a switch on and make more. We
don't,'' he said.
   Watkins declined to discuss in detail the state of the nation's
tritium stockpile, other than to say it is deteriorating at a rate
of 5.5 percent a year with the Savannah River reactors shut down.
   ``We're going through a very dramatic period now,'' he said
before the hearing went behind closed doors for a classified
briefing on the stockpile. ``In the near term, we can meet the
majority of our national security requirements.''

<HEAD>Senate GOP Unveils Campaign Finance Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Republicans are seeking to grab the
initiative on campaign finance reform with a proposal to ban all
political action committees but set no overall spending limits.
   Republican leaders on Tuesday unveiled a package supported by 34
of the Senate's 45 GOP members, as Democrats continued haggling
behind closed doors on their proposal.
   ``Republicans are tired of being accused of obstructing
reform,'' said Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the primary author of
the GOP package. ``The real problem in campaign finance is the
source of political money, not how much spending is necessary.''
   He accused Democrats of trying to railroad through Congress a
bill with spending limits ``because it serves the partisan
interests of the Democratic Party (by) ... curtailing Republican
fundraising advantages.''
   Leading Democrats responded with a willingness to consider the
abolition of PACs _ whose donations in recent years have tended to
benefit incumbent Democrats over GOP challengers _ but only in
exchange for establishing ceilings on spending.
   ``The most important factor in any reform proposal must be
limits on spending,'' said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine. He called the Republican package ``disappointing'' because
it rejects such limits.
   ``There's plenty of room for negotiations,'' said Oklahoma Sen.
David Boren, chief author of the Democratic bill, which Mitchell
plans to bring to the Senate floor, possibly later this week.
   ``We're perfectly willing to eliminate PACs, too,'' Boren said,
``as long as it is within the framework of total, comprehensive
reform, and that means overall spending limits. Without that,
you'll just have this continuing chase for money ... in other
forms.''
   However, several Democrats, including a large number up for
re-election in 1992, have vigorously defended PACs, as have some
Republicans.
   Mitchell and Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said they
believe a bipartisan consensus can be found.
   ``We can either get serious or continue to make speeches and
protect the status quo on Capitol Hill,'' Dole said. ``We're
serious about this. We're willing to work out any differences with
the other party.''
   But in the last week, both party caucuses in the Senate have
moved away from the concept of flexible spending ceilings proposed
as a compromise in March by a panel of experts appointed by
Mitchell and Dole.
   It would have placed fixed limits on how much a candidate can
solicit from individuals and PACs outside his or her state but
imposed no ceiling on small contributions from in-state residents.
   Republicans, in their package, were willing to cut the current
$1,000 limit an individual can give to a campaign to $500 for
out-of-state donors but rejected any limit on the totals that can
be raised from either source.
   Democrats are still insisting on an overall ceiling that also
would cap the amount of allowable in-state contributions. But they
disagree among themselves on how much to curb PAC activities.
   ``There must be 15 versions,'' said Alabama Sen. Howell Heflin,
one of the two Senate Democrats who defected from the party's
position and helped Republicans sustain a filibuster against a
campaign reform bill two years ago.
   Republicans acknowledged the courts likely will reject their
call for a ban on PACs as an unconstitutional abridgement of
freedom of speech and association.
   As a fallback position, their package includes a provision
abolishing corporate and union PACs but allowing so-called
non-affiliated ``issue'' PACs, such as those maintained by groups
on both sides of abortion, gun control and environmental issues.
   However, the ceiling on contributions from those non-affiliated
PACs would be cut from a total of $10,000 for both primary and
general elections to $2,000.
   The GOP package also would ban so-called ``soft money'' _
unreported expenditures by corporations, unions, trade associations
and public interest groups.
   The GOP bill, however, would continue to allow contributions by
individuals to state party organizations to go unreported.

<TEXT>
   A real estate broker who embezzled $2
million in federal housing money to live like a playboy drew six
years in prison from a judge who observed, ``No wonder we have the
national debt we do.''
   Cy Walker, 50, was also fined more than $2 million Tuesday and
ordered to make $2 million in restitution.
   Walker stole from the Department of Housing and Urban
Development in 1986-87 and bought $180,000 in sports cars, an
$18,000 speedboat, furs and jewelry.
   U.S. Attorney Jim Wilson said Walker was not connected to
high-level HUD officials. But, he said, ``The fact that Walker
could have pulled this off is indicative of the weaknesses'' in HUD
under the Reagan administration.
   The agency is under investigation for alleged fraud,
embezzlement, influence-peddling and political favoritism under
then-Secretary Samuel Pierce.
   Walker had pleaded guilty to embezzlement and tax charges. As
part of the plea bargain, he served as an informant in a drug sting
that led to the conviction of a racehorse trainer.
   ``The tragedy of this case is not only that you committed the
crime, but that you were able to get away with it for so long,''
U.S. District Judge Joel Dubina said.
   ``I hope that since this happened, HUD has established a system
of quality control. ... The court is shocked to think how much
money was embezzled nationwide. No wonder we have the national debt
we do.''
   Walker had a HUD contract to handle closings of agency property
in the Montgomery region. A HUD audit found that he diverted
closing money to a personal bank account, then depleted it when the
scheme was discovered.

<HEAD>Tokyo-Seoul Agreement Fails To Drop Fingerprinting Of Ethnic
Koreans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ethnic Koreans are disappointed with a new
agreement on their legal status because it ends fingerprinting for
only the youngest descendants of Koreans brought over during World
War II for forced labor.
   The agreement reached in Seoul on Monday between the foreign
ministers of South Korean and Japan clears the way for President
Roh Tae-woo of South Korea to visit Japan in late May.
   It allows third- and succeeding-generation Koreans to live in
Japan permanently and exempts them from fingerprinting, a
requirement now for all foreign residents of Japan. There are fewer
than a dozen third-generation Koreans in Japan, all of them infants.
   Japan ruled Korea as a colony between 1910 and 1945, when the
war ended with Japan's defeat and the Korean peninsula was divided
into the capitalist south and the communist north.
   ``Among the 700,000 Koreans living in Japan, boys and girls
under the age of 15 number about 120,000. The agreement means that
they still have to have their fingers printed when they reach the
age of 16, like criminal suspects,'' said Hwang Young-man,
secretary general of the pro-Seoul Korean Residents Union.
   Japan retained the right to keep such records on first- and
second-generation Koreans, who were granted permanent resident
status under the 1965 Japan-South Korea normalization treaty.
Similar status has been granted to the roughly 200,000 members of
the pro-North Korea organization, the General Association of Korean
Residents in Japan.
   Japan and North Korea have no diplomatic relations.
   When bilateral talks on the issue were reported to have hit
snags earlier this year over the fingerprinting issue, Roh came
under pressure from opposition and human rights groups to cancel
his scheduled May trip.
   Roh will be the second South Korean president to visit Japan.
His predecessor, Chun Doo-hwan, visited Tokyo in September 1984,
when the late Emperor Hirohito told him at a state dinner, ``It is
indeed regrettable that there was an unfortunate past between us
for a period in this century and I believe that it should not be
repeated again.''
   Pak Jae Ro, a vice chairman of the pro-North Korean group, said
he believed the agreement would bring ``little change'' to the
legal status of Korean residents. He noted that the Seoul agreement
calls for a new registry to replace the present alien registration
card for the third- and succeeding-generation Korean residents.
   ``It means that Japan will invent a new method of registration
and will continue surveillance of Koreans,'' he said.
   Japan's Alien Registration Law requires all foreign residents
over the age of 16 to carry a registration card that contains a
copy of their fingerprint.
   Many Korean residents in Japan complain that they have the same
tax and other obligations as Japanese but do not have the same
rights to education, job opportunities, social security and welfare
programs.

   An American who works for a gold mining
company is believed to be held in Colombia after he was kidnapped
by guerrillas in a remote area in northern Ecuador, U.S. officials
say.
   A companions was killed, officials said Tuesday.
   Scott Heimdal, 28, formerly of Peoria, Ill., was abducted
Saturday while traveling by boat with three Ecuadorans and a
Colombian near the Ecuador-Colombia border. Heimdal was seeking
medical treatment at a support camp for bronchitis and an infected
foot.
   Guerrillas armed with automatic weapons ordered the boat to
stop, then opened fire when the craft's pilot tried to flee, said
Gregory Lagana, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Quito.
   One Ecuadoran was killed, one was wounded, and Heimdal and
Ecuadoran geology student Edwin Teneda, 29, were kidnapped. The
kidnappers later released Teneda.
   Lagana said the guerrillas claim to be part of the Popular
Liberty Army, a Colombian group. Air and land searches for Heimdal
by the Ecuadoran military were unsuccessful.
   The kidnappers have made no demands for the release of Heimdal,
an Army veteran and electronics specialist for the International
Mining Co.
   A government official in Quito said Heimdal had sent letters to
his wife and employer with Teneda. He declined to release the
letters.
   Several foreigners have been kidnapped by Colombians guerrilla
groups to ransom to raise funds for their insurgency.

<HEAD>Indian Loggers Start Cutting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. GERMAIN, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wisconsin's Chippewas, already under
attack from sportsmen for taking advantage of 19th century treaties
letting them spear fish off the reservation, have begun exercising
their right to cut timber as well.
   Four Indians began logging in a state forest Tuesday, but it was
more ceremonial than commercial. They ``cut a couple of trees for
the TV cameras,'' said Ralph Hewett, a state Department of Natural
Resources spokesman.
   ``They really couldn't get started because they were waiting for
some shearing equipment,'' Hewett said.
   The Mole Lake Chippewa band was authorized to begin cutting wood
for free in the Northern Highland-American Legion State Forest
north of Minocqua. The forest is among those used by the state's $8
billion-a-year paper industry.
   Federal courts since 1983 have said that the Chippewas,
according to 19th century treaties under which the tribe ceeded
northern Wisconsin to the U.S. goverment, may hunt, fish, trap and
cut timber on public property.
   Since 1983, they have exercised only the right to spear fish,
encountering sometimes violent protests by fishermen who fear game
fish will be depleted.
   If non-Chippewas were to cut the timber made available Tuesday,
they would have to pay about $160,000 for it. The wood is free to
the Chippewas.
   So far, the Mole Lake band is the only one of Wisconsin's six
Chippewa groups seeking to cut timber.
   Hewett said the logging is under interim rules adopted by the
department. A federal judge is expected to issue a complete ruling
later this year.
   ``It's not like they can come in here and cut anything they
want,'' Hewett said. ``That's why we're happy with the plan.''
   Chippewa leaders said that most of the timber will be sold to
pulp paper companies and that the band will eventually build its
own mills.
   ``This is something to get our feet wet and see how the process
goes,'' Jim Landru, Mole Lake treasurer. He said the enterprise
would help generate jobs on reservations where unemployment
commonly exceeds 50 percent.
   Non-Indian loggers are concerned about the effect on the state's
forest products industry, which employs about 77,000 people, Hewett
said.
   Thomas Schmidt, president of the Wisconsin Paper Council, said
the 33 pulp and paper companies in the trade group were watching
the situation but have taken no position on it.

age 47.
   Deleu had filed a $1.5 million discrimination lawsuit against
Frances Scaife, wife of an heir to the Mellon family fortune and a
committeewoman on the Pittsburgh AIDS Task Force.
   The claim was recently dropped because of a loophole in the
state anti-discrimination law that exempts domestic workers.
   Deleu worked as butler in Mrs. Scaife's apartment for seven
years.
   Hours before his death, Deleu said he forgave his employer,

   The Goddess of Democracy, the converted trawler
that intends to broadcast pro-democracy messages into Communist
China, arrived today for provisions.
   The 1,200-ton ship with 20 people aboard was to leave later
today for Taiwan and was to be positioned in international waters
off the Taiwanese coast, said Christophe Nick, a French journalist
and an organizer.
   China on Sunday accused Taiwan of trying to foment unrest on the
mainland by promising to help the ship. The Beijing government has
refused to rule out the use of force to stop the planned broadcasts.
   The Goddess of Democracy is named after a statue erected by
pro-democracy students in Tiananmen Square last spring before it
was destroyed in the June military crackdown that left hundreds
dead.
   The ship, which left France on March 17, has radio and
television studio facilities. It plans to broadcast music, news and
pro-democracy reports to China. Nick said the ship has 10
crewmembers and 10 journalists.
   It is sponsored by a coalition of groups headed by the French
news magazine Actuel and backed by the Federation For A Democratic
China, a Paris- based dissident organization.
   Taiwan and China have been enemies since the Nationalists lost a
civil war to the Communists in 1949 and fled the mainland.

   About 200 police officers were hurt in
clashes with youths, many of them leftists and some wearing masks,
who hurled rocks and bottles at them after a May Day march, city
officials said today.
   Four of the injured officers were taken to a nearby hospital for
treatment, said West Berlin police spokesman Peter Glaser.
   Police arrested 135 of the youths and used tear gas and
truncheons to contain the protests to the working class district of
Kreuzberg.
   The violence began late Tuesday after a May Day march in the
district by an estimated 10,000 to 20,000 leftist demonstrators
from East and West Berlin.
   It lasted into early this morning.
   In the East German city of Leipzig, a group of leftist youths
brawled on Tuesday with a band of neo-Nazi youths in the market
square, the East german government news agency ADN reported.
   Three people were slightly hurt and 21 were arrested in that
disturbance, the agency said.

   The dollar rose against all major currencies
except the Japanese yen and British pound in moderate European
trading this morning.
   Gold prices were steady at a slightly higher level, dealers said.
   ``The dollar is slightly higher, but it's looking very, very
calm,'' said a Milan trader. ``The general level of uncertainty,
especially for the (West German) mark, is keeping people cautious.''
   Traders said they expected the dollar to trade within a narrow
range this week, ahead of the weekend meeting of the group of seven
major industrial nations in Washington.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.35 yen to a closing 158.55 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a lower rate of 158.05 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Tuesday:
   _ 1.6855 West German marks, up from 1.6785
   _ 1.4600 Swiss francs, up from 1.4545
   _ 5.6530 French francs, up from 5.6365
   _ 1.8935 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8892
   _ 1,235.50 Italian lire, up from 1,231.25
   _ 1.1665 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1435
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound, and was
quoted at $1.6410, compared with $1.6385 late Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $370.25 an ounce, up
from $368.50 bid late Tuesday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $370.50.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $370.40, up from $367.00 late
Monday. Zurich markets were closed Tuesday for the May Day holiday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.15 to close at a bid $371.98.

   Hundreds of people clashed with police in riot
gear in gritty Tompkins Square Park overnight after the city pulled
the plug on a concert. Twenty-seven people were arrested and 17
reported injured.
   Concertgoers and homeless people living in the park taunted
police, hurled bottles, lit fires and overturned trash cans in five
hours of skirmishes that spilled over into the streets of the East
Village.
   The melee came at the end of a ``Squatter Mayday'' concert, part
of a festival of food, music and contests begun Saturday in the
park, where about 200 homeless people live.
   Parks Department officials cut electricity to the bandshell at 9
p.m. in keeping with the city permit, and police went on stage to
remove band members.
   ``People started screaming at the cops. ... The cops grabbed
whoever was in their way and threw them down,'' said Rob Nunzio, a
band member.
   Jason Goodrow, a guitarist in the band performing at the time,
said, ``One cop got hit by a bottle while on stage and got very mad
and started trashing our equipment.''
   ``There were about 300 people there. Some threw bottles. It was
basically a riot,'' said Capt. Charles Hanley.
   Police reinforcements were called in and at one point 250
officers were on the scene, police said. Fights broke out as
protesters tried to goad police or as officers cleared the way for
firetrucks to douse burning trash cans.
   By early today, calm had returned and about 125 police in riot
helmets ringed the park.
   The injured included 15 officers, who were slightly hurt,
authorities said.
   A photographer for the photo agency Gamma Liaison, Michael
Hirsch, said he was jabbed in the back with a nightstick as he
photographed an arrest. He was taken away in an ambulance.
   Police arrested 27 people, mostly for disorderly conduct, police
spokesman Sgt. Ed Burns said.
   In August 1988, the park was the scene of a four-hour melee that
left 52 people injured and led to the filing of more than 110
claims of police brutality. Thousands of police were retrained in
riot control techniques.
   Last summer, there were numerous arrests and standoffs after
police tore down squatters' tents and evicted more than 130 people.

   The government denied a news report that
riot police killed two people at an unauthorized opposition
demonstration that occurred one week after the president lifted a
20-year ban on opposition parties.
   The official Zairean news agency AZAP on Tuesday disputed the
report, which was carried by a French news agency and confirmed by
opposition sources.
   At the same time, the government reportedly demanded that the
news agency's reporter prove that his report was true.
   Also Tuesday, the government canceled its annual May Day labor
parade an hour before it was scheduled to start. The official May
Day march, joined for the first time by unions independent of the
official National Union of Zairean Workers, was canceled for
``technical reasons,'' authorities said.
   No other explanation was given, but it appeared that the
authorities feared the parade might turn into an anti-government
rally. The march was expected to include several thousand people.
   One week ago, President Mobutu Sese Seko lifted the ban on
opposition parties and announced that multiparty elections would be
held next year in this sprawling central African nation of 32
million. Mobutu took power in Zaire since 1965 and outlawed
opposition parties five years later.
   AZAP denied that police killed two supporters of the nation's
largest opposition group during a demonstration on Monday.
   Sources within the group, the Union for Democracy and Social
Progress, later confirmed the news report, saying the killings
occurred when police broke up a rally by 300 people outside the
home of one of its leaders.
   The rally had not been officially approved by police.
Authorities decided Sunday that political rallies in the capital be
subjected to police permission.
   Zaire's Foreign Ministry summoned France's ambassador and the
French news agency's correspondent in Kinshasa, Jean Claude Fiol,
saying the reporter must prove his report about the killings, said
Agence France-Presse.
   AFP said that Fiol also was summoned by the Zairean
communications minister about the report, which quoted witnesses.

   A volunteer firefighter trying to
pump out a contaminated well was asphyxiated by fumes and two
others died trying to rescue him, state police said.
   James F. Chestnut Jr., 20, and Richard L. Hershey, 40, both of
Hustontown, were overcome Tuesday while trying unsuccessfully to
save Thomas L. Lane, 39, of McConnellsburg, state police said.
   A fourth firefighter, Larry Trexler, 20, also of Hustontown, was
hospitalized at Fulton County Medical Center in McConnellsburg, but
officials refused to release information on his condition today.
   All four were members of the Hustontown Volunteer Fire Company.
   Lane was on a ladder in the 38-foot-deep Husontown well, which
was believed to be contaminated by a dead animal, when he was
overcome by fumes, Trooper Denton J. McLaughlin said.
   Trexler entered the well to help, but also was overcome,
McLaughlin said, so Hershey went down to help extract Trexler, but
was overcome. Chestnut died while trying to help the others, the
trooper said.
   The fumes were believed to be methane gas, McLaughlin said,
adding, ``We won't know for sure until the coroner gets blood test
results.''
   Trexler was pulled out by another firefighter. Authorities were
unable to recover Lane's body until about 10 p.m. because he had
fallen into the water, McLaughlin said.

   More than six dozen firefighters in
central Pennsylvania fought flareups today in mopping up the
state's largest forest fire since 1932.
   ``It's mostly a nuisance now,'' said Susan Woomer of the state
forestry bureau. The wind-fanned fire burned 11,800 acres from
Saturday morning to Sunday afternoon, destroying six private camps
on the state-owned lands.
   The forestry bureau was helped by nearly 500 firefighters during
the weekend.
   ``It was the wrong spark at the wrong place at the wrong time,''
said John Berst, the state's chief of operations for forest fire
protection.
   Helicopter pilots bombed state lands with water Tuesday as hot
spots deep in the forest brush continued to smoke, Woomer said. The
cause of the fire was under investigation.
   A northern Pennsylvania fire in 1938 burned 7,000 acres and six
fires in early 1932 burned 87,000 acres, Berst said.

   Zsa Zsa Gabor has been slapped with
an extra 60 hours of community service for serving most of an
earlier sentence at her mansion.
   Municipal Judge Charles Rubin on Tuesday said fund-raising from
the Bel-Air mansion was not what he had in mind last year when he
sentenced Miss Gabor, 72, to 120 hours of community service for
smacking a Beverly Hills motorcycle policeman.
   The judge tacked on the extra time after Vern Davis, executive
director of a shelter in Venice, said Miss Gabor had spent about 50
hours there and the rest of the time at home, organizing a June 8
fund-raiser for the shelter.
   ``(It) means nothing to Miss Gabor, buying community service
hours. She is a wealthy person,'' the judge said after meeting with
Miss Gabor. He said the actress was more interested in
self-promotion than paying her debt to society.
   Miss Gabor later told reporters: ``I served food. Why do I have
to promote myself? I'm so damned famous it's sickening.''

   Ruth Duff was in Palm Springs, Calif.,
last week when she turned on the television and saw her home here
consumed by molten rock.
   On Tuesday, she came back to look at the lava where her home
used to be.
   ``I was in my house watching the news when I saw my house
burning,'' she said. ``Then I thought maybe it was just as well I
wasn't here.''
   Duff lived in the Kalapana Gardens subdivision for 23 years,
after she and her husband bought most of the land from a developer
in 1968. She and her husband, John, purchased about 600 lots, put
in roads and began to sell and lease them.
   On Tuesday, she pointed across the street to six lots, the first
of which was not more than 50 yards away from the lava.
   ``These lots here, we bought them from the Catholic Church a few
years ago,'' she said. ``They must have known something we didn't.''
   Kilauea, the world's most active volcano, has destroyed 126
homes since its latest eruption began in 1983.
   Civil Defense spokesman Lanny Nakano said the 2,000-foot-wide
lava flow was spreading out and moving east across Kalapana Gardens
subdivision.
   Five homes burned down Tuesday as the lava flow moved about 300
yards from the Kalapana Store and Drive-In, the town's meeting
place. Molten rock had moved to within 15 feet of three more homes
late Tuesday, Nakano said.
   A second lava flow poured in from the north. Nakano said it was
moving downhill 1,000 feet from homes and could reach homes by the
weekend.
   About a hundred yards from the Kalapana Store, workers dug up
ground around the Star of the Sea Church, preparing to pick up and
move the ``painted church'' _ so dubbed by locals because of its
brightly decorated interior.
   Behind the church, some newly homeless families frolicked in the
ocean, seemingly oblivious to the molten rock heading their way.
   A woman at the store watched the workers and shook her head.
   ``It's sad,'' she said. ``They don't have any faith. A lot of
people don't want to move it.''
   Gov. John Waihee arrived by helicopter Tuesday to meet with
county and federal disaster officials, visit workers at the church
and say hello to the owner of the store, whom he sends Christmas
cards every year.
   Waihee said the federal government needed to change the way it
was looking at the calamity. The governor has declared the Kalapana
a disaster area in hopes the federal government will do the same
and open the door to aid.
   ``They see this and say, `How can you call this a disaster?'''
he said. ``But we've lost more than 100 homes now.
   ``It's happening slowly, but continuously.''

   Frank Reed greeted his family with tears
and laughter and tried to lift his 9-year-old son into the air _
but was too weak after more than than 3{ years as a hostage in
Lebanon, his wife says.
   Fifi Reed said she, her husband and their son, Tarek, fell into
each other's arms at their reunion Tuesday in West Germany.
   ``Nobody spoke a word, we just hugged each other. Then he
started breaking up. He cried. He broke down and cried,'' she told
Boston TV station WHDH in an interview from Wiesbaden. The Reeds
live in Malden.
   ``We were there to cheer Frank. But Frank was cheering Tarek,
trying to make him laugh, and we ended up laughing, the three of
us.''
   In an interview with NBC's ``Today'' show this morning, she was
asked if her husband felt anger for his captors. ``It's hard to
say,'' she said. ``I mean, he's angry at everybody right now.''
Asked if that included U.S. officials, she replied: ``He didn't
specify that. He just said, everybody.''
   Reed, who was freed on Monday, could not sit still and his
concentration was erratic, his wife said.
   ``That's because he was chained and sitting constantly so he
wanted to move around. I had to keep following him with my eyes,''
she said.
   Mrs. Reed said her husband had no idea he was going to be
released ``because he was told so many times that he was going to
be released that he stopped ... taking that into consideration.''
   His daughter, Marilyn Langston, said her father told her he had
been blindfolded for much of his 42 months in captivity and had
lost 60 pounds.
   ``And he said he hadn't been able to talk for 3{ years,'' said
Langston, who spoke to Reed by telephone from this Boston suburb.
``He talked most of the time. He just wanted to talk. I could
barely get a word in edgewise.''
   On Monday night, Reed made a brief call to his 91-year-old
mother, Leota Sprague. ``He said `Hi, Mom.' I said, `Hi,
Frankie,''' Mrs. Sprague said. ``I knew his voice right away. I was
thrilled.''
   A Malden native, Reed converted to Islam before marrying his
wife. He made two trips to Lebanon before leaving his post as
school principal in Whitefield, N.H., to become director of
elementary education at Beirut's International College in 1977.
   At the time of his abduction Sept. 9, 1986, Reed was running the
private Lebanese International School, which he founded after the
International College was bombed out.

   A senior at Hayfield High School committed
suicide by driving his motorcycle into the side of the school,
authorities said.
   As morning classes were under way Tuesday, Jerry Minnick took
the motorcycle on the school running track, cast off his helmet and
raced full-speed into the outside wall of the boys' locker room. He
died instantly.
   Suicides are not new to the 130,000-student Fairfax County
school system, but this is the first time that a student has killed
himself on the grounds of a school, police and school officials
said.
   Natasha Reid, 17, a Hayfield senior, said Minnick, who
transferred to the school a year ago from a high school in
Franconia, ``didn't come to school much lately.''
   Ms. Reid said Minnick, 18, had been in a car accident in front
of the school about a month ago and a motorcycle accident earlier
in the year.
   County police spokesman Michael Proffitt said Minnick was
``distraught over personal problems.'' Police refused to elaborate
or say whether Minnick left a note.
   Tests will be done to see if Minnick died under the influence of
alcohol or drugs, Proffitt said.
   Minnick was a ward of the state and under the care of the
Fairfax County Department of Human Development. Cathy Wetherby, a
spokeswoman for the department, said no information about his case
would be released.
   Dolores Bohen, spokeswoman for the school system, said the site
of the suicide is bound to deepen the students' grief.
   ``We do what we can to provide support, but the impact of it
happening on school grounds when the students were attending school
has to make it a more stunning reality,'' she said.

   John F. Kennedy Jr., his job as a assistant
district attorney on the line, is turning to a tutor for help in
passing the bar exam, according to a published report.
   ``We'd like to help him pass the bar exam,'' said Stanley Chess,
the director of Bar-Bri, which specializes in training law school
graduates for the bar, the Daily News said today.
   ``He intends to begin his preparation shortly and we're going to
assign a specific attorney in our office _ Erica Fine _ to assist
him,'' Chess said. ``She's probably the best tutor available.''
   Kennedy, only son of President John F. Kennedy, learned last
week that he failed the bar examination for the second time.
   If he fails a third time, the 29-year-old will automatically
lose his job at the Manhattan district attorney's office.
   Fine, a 33-year-old lawyer and the service's assistant director,
said she spoke with Kennedy after he learned he failed February's
test by 11 points.
   ``He's not going to give up,'' Fine told the News. ``He's not a
quitter. He's a really nice guy. I think he's very intelligent. He
may have a problem with the standardized exam, but this is do-able
for him.''

<HEAD>Anti-Government Protest Enters 11th Day</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of anti-government protesters
continued to occupy a downtown square today, and the country's
interim leadership tried to defuse a threat by opposition parties
to boycott elections later this month.
   About 500 anti-government demonstrators occupied University
Square in an ongoing protest that entered its 11th day today. The
protesters are demanding that interim President Ion Iliescu resign
because of his Communist past.
   Their ranks included 25 demonstrators who have vowed to continue
a hunger strike until Iliescu steps down. Seventeen of the hunger
strikers said they have only taken sips of tea since they began
their fast Monday night. Eight others joined the fast later.
   ``I will continue until I die,'' said Viorel Popa, a 25-year-old
worker from the southwestern town of Turnu Severin, who was among
the group of hunger strikers huddled under the balcony of a
Bucharest University building.
   The oldest hunger striker, 66-year-old Nicolae Bucsenescu, said:
``We will not give up until the clique of Reds is removed.''
   The protest has also caused a diplomatic row with France. The
government officially protested today the actions of two French
Parliament members who addressed the crowd on University Square on
Tuesday.
   The University Square protest, which has occurred virtually
round-the-clock since April 22, is the most visible against the
interim government as the country prepares for its first free
elections in more than 50 years on May 20.
   Five major opposition parties threatened on Monday to boycott
the elections, saying more time is needed to prepare for the vote.
They accused Iliescu's National Salvation Front, which dominates
the provisional governing coalition, of monopolizing power.
   On Tuesday, the interim government guaranteed equal chances to
all parties contesting the election and offered to meet the
opposition parties to discuss their criticisms.
   The government said claims that the Front was harassing
opposition activists and using facilities left by the deposed
Communist Party ``can be discussed with representatives of the
government to eliminate any kind of suspicions and to ... improve
some organizational aspects'' of the elections.
   The opposition parties, which repeatedly have accused the Front
of using public funds for electioneering and unfairly dominating
the national media, had no immediate reaction to the government
statement.
   On Tuesday, 8,000 anti-Communist protesters gathered in
University Square to demand Iliescu's resignation.
   They protesters claim the Front is filled with former Communist
Party members who advocate ``neo-Communism.'' Iliescu is a former
Communist Party official who became a critic of deposed dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu.
   The Front has dominated the interim coalition government that
came to power during the December revolution that resulted in
Ceausescu's execution.
   Two visiting French Parliament deputies, Jean-Claude Mignon and
Jean-Pierre Ferrand, both from a right-wing party, spoke to the
crowd occupying University Square Tuesday.
   Government spokesman Cristian Unteanu told The Associated Press
that only Romania's ``very good relations'' with France saved the
two French deputies from being expelled from the country. ``They
should have been declared persona non grata, as in any civilized
country,'' Unteanu said.
   He said Prime Minister Petre Roman had strongly protested the
deputies' behavior in a telephone call today to French Prime
Minister Laurent Fabius.

<TEXT>
   The new democratic Parliament today
cemented Hungary's break with its Communist past by choosing as
interim president a writer who was jailed for six years after the
anti-Soviet revolt of 1956.
   Arpad Goencz, 68, was elected house speaker and interim
president after Hungary's rival main parties, the center-right
Hungarian Democratic Forum and the liberal League of Free
Democrats, forged a surprise agreement.
   The Forum controls 164 seats and the Free Democrats 94, but
Goencz needed the backing of other parties for the two-thirds
majority required to win election in the 394-seat legislature.
   When the vote was announced after a secret ballot, Goencz won
339 votes of the 370 votes cast. The post of president is largely
ceremonial in Hungary.
   Goencz replaces interim president Matyas Szueroes, a member of
the Socialist Party that grew out of the old Communist party and
governed until being roundly defeated in free elections in March
and April.
   Szueroes was elected one of three deputy speakers. Historian
Gyoergy Szabad, 66, and a founding member of the Democratic Forum,
was voted Goencz's chief deputy with 348 votes. Vince Voeroes,
leader of the Smallholders Party, was the third deputy elected.
   Goencz promised to uphold Hungary's new democratic system,
saying: ``I know that confidence cannot be returned, only lost.''
His spoke in a brief thank-you address to Hungary's first
democratic Parliament in more than 40 years.
   Before the vote, a year to the day after Hungary opened the Iron
Curtain and paved the way to Eastern Europe's revolt against
communism, deputies filed into Parliament's lofty chamber, newly
stripped of its Communist coat of arms.
   The insignia of the old ``People's Republic,'' renamed simply
the ``Republic of Hungary'' in October, was removed just last week.
   In another gesture symbolizing Hungary's transition from
communism to democracy, many deputies arrived from St. Stephen's
Cathedral, reviving a long-lost tradition of attending Mass before
opening Parliament.
   The deputies also bid a formal farewell to the caretaker
government of Socialist Miklos Nemeth, likely to be replaced this
month by Jozsef Antall, leader of the Hungarian Democratic Forum,
which won the elections.
   Goencz, a lawyer who entered politics after World War II as a
member of the then dominant Smallholders' party, has headed the
Hungarian Writers' Union since last December.
   He spent six years in jail after the 1956 revolt against
Stalinism before winning a reprieve on his life sentence in the
general amnesty of 1963.
   At a news conference before the vote , Antall said his party and
the rival Free Democrats also had agreed that Parliament _ and not
the nation as a whole _would choose the final president.
   Goencz is likely to get that post once a coalition government is
formed by mid-May and the constitution is amended, likely in early
June, Antall said at a joint news conference with Free Democrat
leader Peter Toelgyessy.
   Unlike other East European nations, where the move away from
communism was swift and dramatic, Hungary shifted toward democracy
in gradual steps led by reform-minded Communists over the past two
years.
   One of its boldest moves was to begin demolishing Iron Curtain
fortifications along the border with Austria exactly one year ago.
The move encouraged a westward exodus of East Germans.
   Despite the reforms of Hungary's Communists, four decades of
repressive rule built up so much popular anger that their Socialist
successors won only 33 seats in the recent elections.
   Hungary's politics are now dominated by the center-right and
strongly nationalist Forum and the liberal League of Free
Democrats, founded by former dissidents.
   The Forum wants to form a majority coalition with the
like-minded agrarian-based Independent Smallholders, who have 44
deputies, and the Christian Democrats, who have 21.
   The session's opening minutes were laden with gestures intended
to link Hungary's new democracy with spells of past liberty.
   An actor gave a stirring rendition of a poem by Sandor Petoefi,
the firebrand leader of the failed 1848 revolt against Austrian
Hapsburg rule, in which the poet called on Hungarian lawmakers ``to
build a new country, better than the old.''
   Otto von Habsburg, the former crown prince of Hungary and a
member of the European Parliament, was present.

   The two German states agreed on a plan today
for merging their economies, settling basic differences over how
the nations should assess the costs of unification, officials said.
   The tentative agreement sets the stage for a full merger of the
economies of the two nations on July 2.
   The nations have been negotiating for weeks over how West
Germany can absorb the decimated East German economy without
threatening the strength of the powerful West German mark.
   The agreement was confirmed by Mathias Gehler, spokesman for
East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere, and Rudolf Seiters,
chief of staff for West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   The plan calls for exchanging the nearly worthless East German
marks at a 1-1 rate for the West German mark, which will become the
currency of East Germany in July.
   The rate would cover wages, rents and pensions but would only
apply to small savings accounts. In a concession to East German
demands, the West German government agreed to a higher ceiling on
the bank accounts of elderly East Germans.
   Several protests have been held in recent weeks by East Germans
demanding protection from the widespread unemployment expected to
occur when East German enterprises are forced to compete in the
free market.
   East Germans, who still only will earn about one-third of their
West German counterparts, also fear rising prices and the loss of
subsidies when the nations are united.
   West Germans, meanwhile, fear that absorbing the East German
economy will dilute the power of the mighty West German currency
and lead to higher taxes and inflation.
   Savings accounts above $2,300 would be exchanged at a 2-1 rate.
However, the 1-1 rate would apply to accounts of up to $3,530 for
East Germans aged 60 and older, and up to $1,180 for those of East
Germans aged 14 and younger.
   Debts owned by East German enterprises _ estimated to total $153
billion _would be converted at a 2-1 rate.
   Some economists say the debts should be forgiven so East German
businesses and factories can have a fresh start when they enter the
free market.
   Chief West German negotiator Hans Tietmeyer, a director of the
West German central bank, said the Bundesbank was in agreement with
the proposal.
   The Bundesbank previously had said that a basic 1-1 conversion
could lead to higher interest rates.
   The former East German government valued the East German mark at
a 3-1 rate, but it truth it was virtually worthless in Western
markets.
   A full political merger between the Germanys likely will take
place next year. The four World War II allies that divided the
country, the Soviet Union, United States, France and Britain, are
to meet this Saturday in Bonn to discuss the international
implications of unification.

   The United States will suffer a sharp loss of
influence in Europe if Americans withdraw their troops, West German
Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg says.
   ``In the past, American cooperation and influence on European
policy was helpful, and in future, American policy and influence in
Europe can be helpful,'' Stoltenberg said Tuesday evening.
   ``But without any soldiers or significant (numbers of) soldiers,
your influence in all matters of security policy will sharply
decline,'' he added. ``And I doubt whether this is desirable.''
   Stoltenberg said in a speech before the American Institute for
Contemporary German Studies of the Johns Hopkins University that
Americans should maintain a substantial military presence for the
foreseeable future.
   He said the United States might be able to reduce its forces in
Central Europe beyond the 195,000 troops proposed by President
Bush, if that could be coordinated with European allies and the
Soviet Union.
   The defense minister met with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
earlier Tuesday, and they discussed German unification and other
European issues, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said.
   A Pentagon source who spoke on background said the officials
discussed problems with East-West talks in Vienna to cut
conventional forces in Europe. He declined to say what the problems
were.
   Stoltenberg called on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to
retain nuclear forces in Europe, but said their numbers should be
greatly reduced.

   The Army is looking for the next of kin for
six crewmen who died when their B-17 was lost on a 1942 patrol over
the Coral Sea, officials say.
   Although the aircraft was found and the crew list confirmed
after several research missions to Papua New Guinea in 1986 and
1987, relatives of six of the eight crewmen haven't been found,
Shari Lawrence, spokeswoman for the U.S. Total Army Personnel
Command, said Tuesday.
   The plane disappeared after leaving from Townsville in
Queensland, Australia. The Army believes the crew encountered the
enemy because the Battle of the Coral Sea occurred in the days
immediately after its disappearance, the statement said.
   The six crewmen whose next of kin haven't been found are:
   _2nd Lt. Jim Sam Grant, born Jan. 28, 1918. Last known next of

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West German President Richard von
Weizsaecker arrived today on an official four-day visit, as Poland
seeks guarantees for its borders in upcoming negotiations on German
unification.
   Von Weizsaecker, the first West German head of state to visit
Poland, began his trip just days before the two Germanys and the
four victorious World War II allies _ the United States, Soviet
Union, Britain and France _ are to meet in Bonn to discuss the
international implications of German unification.
   Von Weizsaecker was greeted at Warsaw's airport by President
Wojciech Jaruzelski and Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the head
of the Solidarity-led government.
   He is scheduled to hold talks with both Polish leaders as well
as other dignitaries, including Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and
Cardinal Jozef Glemp, the Roman Catholic primate.
   The West German president will also visit the former Nazi death
camp at Treblinka, and the city of Gdansk, where the first shots of
World War II were fired.
   Von Weizsaecker's trip marks a new stage in the difficult, and
sometimes bloody, relations between Poland and Germany.
   West Germany is Poland's largest Western trading partner, and
its support is critical to the success of the economic and
political reforms undertaken by the new non-Communist government.
   But with an older generation that recalls the devastating World
War II invasion and Nazi occupation, Poland harbors feelings of
bitterness and distrust toward Germany that has come to the fore in
the rush toward unification.
   Poland is seeking a seat at unification talks to guarantee its
postwar western border, and wants a treaty with the two Germanys
and the new government of a united Germany making the boundary
permanent.
   Drawn along the Oder and Neisse rivers, the post-World War II
boundary incorporates into Poland 40,000 square miles of land that
was former German territory.
   This week, Poland submitted a draft treaty to the two Germanys
and the four World War II allies. U.S. Secretary of State James A.
Baker III and foreign ministers from the other countries will meet
in Bonn on Saturday to discuss German unification.
   On the eve of his visit, von Weizsaecker offered assurances to
Poles on the border issue.
   ``The essence of the border problem has been unequivocally
settled. We cannot argue over territories and borders in Europe any
more,'' von Weizsaecker told Polish television Tuesday.
   Today's issue of the pro-Solidarity newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza
welcomed von Weizsaecker's visit with the headline, ``This German
inspires confidence,'' over a profile outlining the West German
president's long support for Poland's border concerns.
   Kohl made a historic, emotional _ and at points controversial _
visit to Poland in November. The trip was interrupted for a day

<HEAD>Counselor in Lake Tragedy Used Marijuana Five Hours Before Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A camp counselor who drowned trying to save
three teen-agers in icy Convict Lake in February had used marijuana
within five hours of his death, forensic toxicologists said.
   Randall Porter, 41, was lauded as a hero for his dying efforts
to save the youths. But investigators have questioned whether the
youths were properly supervised when they went onto the thin ice of
the Sierra Nevada lake.
   The toxicological tests of a sample of Porter's blood don't
indicate whether his judgment was impaired by the drug, said Dean
Warden, a forensic toxicologist with the state Department of
Justice.
   The test, however, indicates Porter had used marijuana within
five hours of his death, Warden said Tuesday.
   Results of toxicological tests on the other victims of the Feb.
19 tragedy were negative, according to the Mono County Sheriff's
Department.
   Three juvenile offenders housed at Camp O'Neal fell through the
ice and drowned during an outing. Four adults, including Porter and
another counselor, drowned trying to save the youths.
   Mono County prosecutors declined to file criminal charges in the
drownings, but the toxicological test on Porter could be a factor
in possible civil suits.
   The state Department of Social Services suspended Camp O'Neal's
license in March for allegedly failing to provide proper
supervision and care for the 34 teen-age boys sent to the camp by
probation and social service officials.

<HEAD>Telephone Worker Receives $1 Million Award</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A telephone company worker who claimed
racial harassment forced her to quit after 13 years with Southern
Bell has been awarded $1 million by a federal jury.
   Mary Ann Vance claimed that twice in 1984 she found a noose
hanging from her work station at the company's Jacksonville
warehouse.
   The award Tuesday came in a second trial after a $3.5 million
jury award in 1987 was thrown out as unreasonable and excessive.
   ``Thank you, Jesus, thank you,'' Mrs. Vance said as she embraced
friends in the courtroom when the verdict was announced.
   Dana Bradford, a Southern Bell attorney, said the company will
appeal the verdict by the all-white jury.
   Mrs. Vance, 41, charged she received inadequate training and was
subject to unfair disciplinary actions from managers because she is
black. She testified that she heard after finding the nooses that
one of her supervisors had placed them at her work station ``to
increase productivity.''
   Southern Bell attorneys contended Mrs. Vance created the noose
incidents and suffered from a severe behavioral disorder that
caused much of the stress she attributed to Southern Bell.
   They said the stress from five failed marriages and financial
troubles _ not racial harassment _ was the cause of her problems.
   Jurors deliberated more than four hours before reaching a
verdict. They awarded Mrs. Vance $500,000 in punitive damages and
$511,500 in compensatory damages to cover past and future wages as
well as medical costs.
   Mrs. Vance has been undergoing weekly therapy for anxiety since
late 1984.

<HEAD>Press Accuses Protesters of Insult Gorbachev, Warns of Possible
Backlash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading Soviet newspaper said today that columns
of angry protesters who marched through Red Square on May Day
insulted President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and may engender a backlash.
   Anti-government demonstrators were allowed to parade past
Lenin's Mausoleum for the first time Tuesday in the traditional May
Day ceremony. They shouted ``Shame!'' at the Soviet leadership,
unfurled Lithuanian national flags and carried signs bitterly
critical of the leadership.
   The extent and content of the public criticism was unprecedented
for Gorbachev in his five years as Soviet leader.
   He and the other leaders gathered on top of the Mausoleum left
after about 20 minutes of the protest, but it was not immediately
apparent whether they left because of it.
   However, the Tuesday evening edition of the government newspaper
Izvestia said that in those conditions, Gorbachev and the rest of
the leadership ``had to leave Red Square.''
   Today was the last day of a three-day holiday for Soviets, and
there was no comment on the May Day protest by Soviet officials.
   But Izvestia said the informal groups who gathered at least
100,000 protesters for the march ``for some reason ... thought that
only by completely running down the government, only with direct
insults of the president could they show their bravery and speed up
changes in the country.''
   ``We don't exclude that in the end they may achieve some kind of
acceleration,'' it added. ``But the whole question is, to what side
will the changes be?''
   The protesters were pressing for more rapid change than
Gorbachev has allowed, but the Soviet leader also is under pressure
from more conservative people who think he is moving too fast.
Those forces, the article implied, could cause a conservative
backlash.
   Speakers at a rally organized by trade union officials before
the May Day march warned of inflation and unemployment if the
government goes ahead with plans to develop a market economy.
   Gorbachev impatiently tapped his fingers during the protest, but
otherwise showed no emotion.
   Izvestia accused the leaders of the demonstration of
``elementary political illiteracy.'' It added that some of the
banners and chants were ``aimed at direct confrontation with
constitutional authority.''
   Pravda, the Communist Party daily, carried a report on the May
Day parade on its front page, but buried any comment on the protest
in one paragraph near the end.
   The informal groups, it said, ``unfortunately did not restrain
themselves from extremist slogans, containing provocative, gross
and insulting attacks against constitutional authority.''
   Nationwide television showed less of the May Day festivities
than usual, and the coverage was cut off before the unofficial
protest began. Other Soviet newspapers carried reports only about
the official part of the celebration.

<TEXT>
   President F. W. de Klerk and
African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela pledged today to
abolish apartheid as they launched historic talks on ending white
minority rule.
   De Klerk and Mandela said the government and the rival ANC would
seek to quickly clear the way for full-scale constitutional
negotiations on bringing the 28-million black majority into the
national government.
   Mandela, standing next to de Klerk in front of a palatial Dutch
colonial mansion where the talks will take place through Friday,
said swift progress was vital and the patience of blacks was
running out.
   ``We must succeed in the endeavor to remove these obstacles so
that we can together move forward as rapidly as possible to end the
inhuman system of apartheid,'' Mandela said.
   The ANC has been seeking discussions with white-led South
African governments since the organization was founded in 1912.
   De Klerk also called for rapid progress. He challenged the ANC
to help end a wave of violence that has claimed hundreds of lives
in recent months, and said all political parties must make every
effort to restore peace.
   ``The vast majority of South Africans desire the negotiation
process aimed at a new constitution to get started in all
earnest,'' de Klerk said.
   The ANC is demanding the government end a state of emergency,
release all political prisoners, and allow the return of all ANC
exiles as preconditions for full-scale constitutional talks.
   De Klerk stressed that the white government was acting on behalf
of all South Africans and wanted to create a multiracial democracy
where the right of all individuals would be equally protected. But
he said growing violence and racial division was a threat to hopes
of peace.
   ``Confrontation will get South Africans nowhere. Our joint
destiny demands that all of us steer clear of it,'' he said.
   De Klerk expressed hope that the two sides would make quick
progress and overcome the obstacles blocking full negotiations.
``There is cautious optimism, as well as faith and conviction that
our problems will be solved by negotiation.
   ``The government has accepted the challenge of doing everything
possible to achieve this,'' he said.
   Mandela, who complimented de Klerk on his speech, said the talks
were an important step toward ending apartheid. He cautioned that
black South Africans wanted immediate change and the two sides had
to make rapid progress.
   The black nationalist leader denounced the policies of white
minority rule, saying racial superiority and segregation could
never again be the basis for politics and society in South Africa.
He said blacks would never again accept that they had to be
inferior to whites.
   ``The pace at which we move to arrive at a just solution should
be informed by the fact that the black masses of our country demand
and expect fundamental change now and not tomorrow. The people as a
whole want the peace and stability which can only come about as a
result of the total abolition of the apartheid system,'' Mandela
said.
   Mandela attempted to reassure whites by saying there would be no
discrimination against them in a future, multiracial democracy. In
a gesture the majority of whites who are of Dutch heritage, he made
the assurance in the Afrikaans language.
   The subject of violence on both sides was expected to be a major
point of discussion. The ANC demands that the government control
police violence and end the national state of emergency that gives
officers wide powers and makes them almost immune from prosecution
for any act.
   De Klerk and other government officials have asked the ANC
leaders to stop their calls for armed struggle and have expressed
displeasure at the continuing recruitment of guerrillas into the
ANC's military wing, which was founded by Mandela.
   Joe Modise, commander of the military wing, said on Tuesday
night that ``Spear of the Nation'' would continue recruiting
members inside South Africa, because the South African Defense
Force and white right-wing groups are continuing to recruit.
   Modise, who is a member of the ANC delegation in the talks, said
he was not surprised that the government team did not include
Defense Minister Magnus Malan. ``I nearly didn't come myself,''
said Modise. ``The army is the enemy on one side. (The ANC
guerrilla wing) is the enemy from their point of view.''
   Modise and Joe Slovo, the white leader of the South African
Communist Party, could both be charged with capital crimes under
South African law because they have headed the ANC's military wing.
   De Klerk assured them they would not be arrested so they would
come to the talks from their exile headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia.

<HEAD>China Authorized to Buy Additional Wheat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China has been authorized to buy an additional
2 million metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices, the
Agriculture Department announced today.
   Undersecretary Richard T. Crowder said the wheat will be
available to China under the department's Export Enhancement
Program, or EEP. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to
36.7 bushels of wheat.
   The new subsidy line was on top of 5,050 tons left from an EEP
allocation of 1 million tons made on Feb. 8. Since the subsidy
program began five years ago, China has used it to buy about 15.2
million tons of U.S. wheat, exceeded only by the Soviet Union at
20.8 million tons.
   Under EEP arrangements, private exporters can sell U.S.
commodities at reduced prices to meet foreign competition in
selected overseas markets and then collect free government
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies.
   The subsidies have averaged from around $4 per ton, to more than
$40 per ton of wheat, or in the range of 11 cents to about $1.10
per bushel.
   Purchases of U.S. wheat for 1989-90 delivery total about 5.7
million tons, much of it without subsidies. In 1988-89, China
bought nearly 8.1 million tons, all of it carrying EEP subsidies.
   China's wheat orders under the program for the 1990-91 marketing
year that will begin June 1 are reported at 1 million tons.

   Sergio Franchi, a singer with operatic
ambitions who had a hit with ``O' Sole Mio'' and crooned in TV
commercials for the Plymouth Volare in the 1970s, has died of
cancer.
   The Italian-born tenor died Tuesday at his estate. He never
publicly revealed his age, although some sources list it as 57.
   Franchi performed around the country and was a headliner in Las
Vegas in the 1960s and '70s, blending popular standards and
operatic arias.
   He made 25 albums including such songs as ``O' Sole Mio,''
``Wind Beneath My Wings'' and ``Memory.'' In the mid-1970s, Franchi
crooned, ``Volare, ohhhhhhhh,'' in commercials for the Volare
automobile.
   Born in Cremona, Italy, Franchi studied to be an engineer while
training in opera. He performed in South Africa in ``La Traviata,''
``La Boheme'' and ``Carmen'' before leaving to advance his operatic
career.
   In Italy, England and later the United States, he encountered
difficulty getting parts. Instead he became a frequent guest on
``The Ed Sullivan Show.''
   His film credits included a supporting role in ``The Secret of
Santa Vittoria'' in 1969.
   Survivors include his wife, Eva; a daughter; a son; and two
sisters.
   Funeral services will be private.

<TEXT>
   Arpad Goencz, the writer and former
political prisoner chosen interim president of Hungary on
Wednesday, dedicated his life to fighting the hard-line Communist
leaders who were ousted last year.
   In 1948, when the Communists seized control, Goencz lost his job
as a prominent editor and was forced to work as an unskilled
laborer.
   In 1956, he was at the forefront of Hungary's short-lived revolt
against Stalinism, and paid for his involvement with six years in
jail. He won a reprieve on his life sentence under a 1963 amnesty.
   Once free, Goencz began translating British and American novels
into Hungarian, and later published several of his own novels and
short stories.
   By the 1970s, he became associated with dissidents who signed
petitions and published underground literature in a campaign to get
the Communist authorities to be more democratic and respect human
rights.
   He joined with them in founding the League of Free Democrats,
now Hungary's second-largest political party, in May 1988.
   A stout, balding grandfather, Goencz was born in Budapest in
1922. He trained as a lawyer and graduated in 1944 from the city's
respected university. He immediately entered politics under the
then-dominant Smallholders' Party.
   The Smallholders won control of Parliament in 1946. Goencz, then
editor of a Budapest weekly, seemed set for a prominent career with
the conservative party that drew its strength from the farmers
running Hungary's agrarian-based economy.
   The Communist takeover in 1948 changed his fortunes. While
evidently failing to dent his commitment to democracy, the twist of
fate apparently made Goencz philosophical about his newfound
political stardom.
   ``I would not call myself a professional politician,'' Goencz
said when elected head of the Writers' Union in December. ``The
homo politicus and the writer in me are one. What is now taking
place is the realization of my political dreams _ not of my career
wishes,'' he said of Hungary.
   After Vaclav Havel in Czechoslovakia, Goencz is the second
writer-president in newly democratic eastern Europe. ``There is a
great conspiracy of international writers,'' Goencz joked to
Western reporters after his election.
   Goencz was a surprise choice for interim president in a May Day
agreement hammered out by the Free Democrats and the victors of
last month's free elections, the Hungarian Democratic Forum.
   The conservative Forum, expected to forge a center-right
coalition government with two like-minded parties later this month,
apparently wanted to stress national unity as Hungary faces a
mounting economic crisis.
   Goencz is expected to be named to a full four-year term as
president once the coalition is formed and Parliament in June
passes constitutional amendments that would give the legislature _
not the nation _ the task of naming a full president. As interim
president, Goencz's powers are largely ceremonial and in line with
those of the presidents of many west European states.
   The president is commander in chief of the armed forces and is
empowered to initiate a plebiscite, negotiate international
agreements and exercise clemency for prisoners. Under the current
constitution, the president may serve a maximum of two four-year
terms.

<HEAD>IRA Bomb Explodes at Army Base, Seven Injured</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBURN, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Irish Republican Army bomb
exploded today at a military base in this town southwest of
Belfast, injuring seven people, police said.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary said one civilian employee was
seriously injured and six other people, including two children,
were treated for minor injuries and shock.
   A Constabulary spokesman, who was not named in keeping with
British custom, said the bomb exploded under a Land Rover as the
civilian employee was moving it in the garage or parking area of
the Territorial Army base in Lisburn, seven miles southwest of
Belfast.
   The Territorial Army is a reserve force that is locally
recruited.
   Earlier today, a mortar bomb exploded in a Londonderry police
station and a second device was defused by bomb disposal experts,
police said. No one was injured in the attack.
   A hijacked van, from which the mortar bomb attack was launched,
was found 200 yards away from the police station, the Constabulary
spokesman said.
   Police said two gunmen, who identified themselves as IRA
members, held a family hostage while they hijacked the van. The
family was released unharmed.
   The latest bombing incidents follow a public warning last week
by Northern Ireland's police headquarters, which said it had
received intelligence reports that the IRA planned to step up its
offensive to end British rule.
   The IRA claimed responsibility for the blast at the army base in
a telephone call to the British domestic news agency, Press
Association.
   The IRA said its men breached the security fencing around the
base and planted a five-pound, booby-trap bomb under a Land Rover.
The telephone caller said the bomb was made of Semtex, the
Czechoslovakian-made plastic explosive.
   The Irish Republican Army wants to unite mostly Protestant
Northern Ireland with the mainly Roman Catholic Republic of
Ireland, under socialist rule.

<TEXT>
   U.S. government sources say there
has been no discussion of the hostage issue in meetings this week
between U.S. and Iranian representatives, even though two American
hostages have been released.
   The meetings began Tuesday in the Hague between the State
Department's legal adviser, Abraham Sofaer, and his Iranian
counterpart, Jaromi Eftekhar to discuss claims disputes. The
Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal is the only official forum where the two
nations meet.
   The meetings take place almost monthly in The Hague, a U.S.
source said on condition of anonymity. He decribed Tuesday's
meeting as ``routine.''
   President Bush has praised both Iran and Syria for their roles
in the release of Robert Polhill on April 22 and Frank Reed on
Monday. The men were among eight Americans believed held in Beirut
by pro-Iranian groups.
   Iran and Syria have said all 16 remaining Western hostages in
Lebanon should be freed. Both countries reportedly are anxious to
establish closer ties with the West.
   But Bush has said he won't deal to free the hostages.
   A special State Department team was questioning Reed for a
second day today in a search for inforamtion about the remaining
Western captives.
   The private U.S.-Iranian talks were believed to center on a
settlement of all so-called ``Small Claims'' of under $250,000.
   Those claims comprise the bulk of the caseload of the tribunal,
charged with settling billions of dollars in claims between the two
nations arising from the 1979 Iranian revolution.
   So far, the arbitration panel has presided over the settlement
of more than $2.2 billion in financial disputes stemming primarily
from expropriations by the Iranian government.
   U.S. and Iranian tribunal officials have repeatedly denied
reports that their negotiations touch on the hostage issue.
   ``The officials, as they have in the past, are here to discuss
legal and technical issues concerning tribunal cases,'' U.S.
Embassy spokesman Leonardo Williams said.
   The 9-year-old claims tribunal was set up as part of the 1980
Algiers Accords that brought freedom to the U.S. diplomats held
hostage in the U.S. Embassy in Tehran for 444 days.
   Secrecy is a hallmark of the proceedings, which occur in a
converted hotel on a quiet residential street.
   The claims are handled by three so-called chambers, each of
which has an Iranian, an American and a third-nation arbitrator who
acts as chairman.
   Ninety-five percent of the claims were filed by American
companies against Iran. A small number were filed by Iranian
commercial entities against U.S. companies and the U.S. government.
   The largest is Iran's claim against the United States for
military-related items ordered by the pre-revolutionary government
of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. The claim, known as B1, amounts to
up to $11 billion.
   Various Iranian officials in the past have tied progress on the
hostage issue to progress on that claim, as well as the return of
frozen Iranian assets.
   But the U.S. government says much of the military equipment was
never paid for, and is being held by contractors over which the
United States has no influence.
   The tribunal source said $11 billion has so far been transferred
to Iranian control. About $6 billion of that was used by Iran to
pay Western bank loans.
   The amount of Iranian funds still frozen in accounts runs only
into the millions, the tribunal source said.
   The tribunal is seeking a way to settle the small claims
together and wipe out the remaining caseload of 2,450.

   An American mining company employee has been
kidnapped and a Ecuadorean national killed by guerillas in Ecuador,
government officials said.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Gregory Lagana, in Quito, Ecuador, said
the kidnap victim, Scott Heimdal, 28, has been missing since
Saturday, the Peoria Journal Star reported Tuesday.
   Heimdal, formerly of Peoria, was traveling by boat along the
Bermeja River on the Ecuador-Colombian border when he was taken by
rebels, according to the newspaper.
   Ecuadorian Armed Forces launched an air-and-land search Sunday,
but U.S. officials said they believe Heimdal was being held in
Colombia.
   Lagana said Heimdal was working in Ecuador for the International
Mining Co. He was traveling with three Ecuadoreans and a Colombian
boat pilot to a support camp seeking medical treatment for an
infected foot and bronchitis.
   Lagana said the boat was ordered to stop by a small band of
guerrillas armed with automatic weapons.
   When the boat pilot tried to flee, the newspaper reported, the
guerrillas opened fire, killing one Ecuadorean, wounding another
and kidnapping Heimdal and Ecuadorean geology student Edwin Teneda,
29.
   The kidnappers later released Teneda, with two letters written
by Heimdal, one to his wife and the other to his company. The
letters' contents were not revealed.
   Authorities said Heimdal was put on a boat moving up the
Rumiyacu River, which crosses into Colombia.
   Lagana said the guerrillas claim to be part of the Popular
Liberty Army, a Colombian group.
   The kidnappers have made no demands for the release of Heimdal,
a U.S. Army veteran and an electronics specialist for the mining
company.

<HEAD>Top Military Official Chosen as New Prime Minister in Taiwan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNIE HUANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Lee Teng-hui today chose the
country's top military official to be the new prime minister in a
surprise move that opposition leaders denounced as a setback for
democracy.
   Defense Minister Hau Pei-tsun, the country's only four-star
general, said he accepted the offer to head the government during a
meeting with the president. The 71-year-old Hau would replace Lee
Huan, 73, in about two weeks.
   ``President Lee said the country needs me,'' Hau said in a
television interview. ``I thought I should not defy him.''
   Hau, who would be the first general to become prime minister in
27 years, said the proposed appointment does not mean the military
will interfere in politics. ``There are many such precedents in
democratic countries,'' he said.
   Lee is expected to formally announce Hau's appointment May 20
when he is sworn in as president for a new six-year term. The
nomination must then be approved by the Parliament, which is
controlled by members of the ruling Nationalist Party.
   Opposition leaders reacted to Hau's nomination with suspicion
and expressed concern about its impact on recent moves to
liberalize the country's political system.
   Chen Shui-pien, a lawmaker from the Democratic Progressive
Party, denounced the appointment as ``a move to drive Taiwan's
democracy backward.''
   Another opposition leader, Jiang Peng-chien, called Hau's
nomination ``odd and inappropriate ... an apparent compromise with
the military.''
   He expressed concern that the military would take it as a signal
to interfere more in politics.
   ``The military has mistaken our society's newly emerged
pluralism as social chaos and wants to stamp out opposition
voices,'' Jiang said.
   The Nationalist Party has gradually eased its authoritarian grip
in recent years _ lifting martial law, allowing opposition
political parties and bringing more of the native Taiwanese who
account for 85 percent of the island's 20 million people into
government.
   But Hau belongs to the Nationalist Party's Old Guard that fled
to Taiwan with Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek after losing a civil
war to the Communists on the Chinese mainland in 1949.
   Some politicians also wondered how Hau's appointment would
affect the gradual easing of restrictions on contact with mainland
China that has resulted in hundreds of thousands of Taiwan
residents traveling to the mainland.
   The government now also tolerates indirect investment and trade
with the Chinese mainland and is under pressure from businessmen to
further broaden contacts.
   Hau is among the Nationalist conservatives who still dream of
returning to China to overthrow the Communists, and he may be
expected to take a fairly hard-line stance on relations with
Beijing.
   However, he may still be an acceptable choice to Chinese
Communist officials because he shares their view that Taiwan is
part of China and should not abandon the goal of eventual
reunification.
   Political observers say Lee's move to appoint Hau represents an
attempt to broaden his power base and stem criticism among aging
Nationalist conservatives who have questioned his pragmatic
policies toward their enemies in Beijing.
   Lee is the first native Taiwanese to serve as president and head
of the ruling party. He succeeded Chiang Ching-Kuo, Chiang
Kai-shek's son, who died in office in January 1988.
   Hau was appointed defense minister last year after being chief
of the 500,000-member armed forces for eight years.

   Efforts to cut U.S. medical costs should leave in
place the safety mechanisms that catch mistakes doctors make in
prescribing drugs, says a researcher who documented hundreds of
such errors at a New York hospital.
   The study in today's Journal of the American Medical Association
found an average of 2{ errors a day in written prescriptions at
640-bed Albany Medical Center Hospital in 1987. One in five
mistakes could have been serious or fatal.
   ``Medication errors are an all too common occurrence in the
provision of modern health care and one of the many `hazards of
hospitalization,''' the researchers said.
   Doctors at Albany wrote 289,411 prescriptions in 1987, and
errors occurred in 905 of them, including 182 mistakes that could
have caused severe harm or death if they had gone undetected, the
researchers reported.
   However, ``quality assurance procedures operative within our
hospital and in most health-care systems ... appear to be quite
effective,'' said Timothy S. Lesar, assistant pharmacy director for
clinical services and the study's co-author.
   ``All these errors were averted. They never put a patient at
risk,'' he said in a telephone interview Monday.
   Five years ago, an error by two doctors in administering a drug
to a pregnant cancer patient at Albany led to better drug-control
procedures there, the researchers said.
   The patient was left comatose and near death, and her premature
baby later died; the hospital was cited by the New York Health
Department for lacking effective policies to control dangerous
drugs.
   Now, for written prescriptions, the hospital's pharmacists enter
doctors' orders into a computer that checks them again against
patient data about drug allergies and other information,
researchers said.
   In New York hospitals overall in 1984, drugs accounted for 20
percent of the 27,000 treatment-related patient injuries, according
to Dr. Howard H. Hiatt, head of a Harvard Medical School study
released last month. The study did not identify the number of
injuries that might have been caused by physician errors.
   ``Things do fall between the safety net,'' Neil M. Davis,
professor of pharmacy at Temple University School of Pharmacy in
Philadelphia, said today. He said the Albany study documented
``what pharmacists have always known.''
   ``Hospitals better have good pharmacy units,'' Davis said in a
telephone interview, adding that pharmaceutical services tend to
need strengthening in intensive care and newborn care units.
   The Albany study found an error rate of 3.13 per 1,000 orders
written. Of the 905 errors, 522, or 57.7 percent, were
``significant,'' meaning they could have caused adverse
consequences, the researchers said.
   Mistakes varied from ordering too strong a tranquilizer for the
size or age of a patient to prescribing penicillin or a related
drug to a patient allergic to it.
   Researchers found higher error rates in obstetrics-gynecology
and surgery-anesthesia than in other services, possibly reflecting
less time or emphasis on nonsurgical aspects of patient care during
training programs, they said.
   Error rates were higher among first-year residents and declined
with successive years of training, the researchers said.
   Mistakes were highest during daytime hours, when large numbers
of prescriptions were being written, and lowest during evening
hours, suggesting fatigue is not a factor in prescription errors,
the researchers said.

   A knife-wielding mugger held up a messenger
Wednesday and escaped with $475 million in financial certificates,
police said.
   The Bank of England immediately issued a warning to banks and
money market firms, but said it would be ``extraordinarily
difficult'' to use the certificates of deposit and Treasury Bills
to raise money.
   A Bank of England spokesman said there was a ``remote'' chance
the certificates and bills could be used illegally to secure a bank
loan.
   The messenger was attacked while walking from Sheppards money
brokers to another finance house in London's financial district,
the City of London.
   Sheppards money brokers refused to comment on the incident and
police were interviewing the messenger, who was not identified.

   A Korean fishing trawler with 17
crew members aboard sank off the northern New Zealand coast
Wednesday, and defense officials said rescuers found three
survivors and two bodies.
   The boat Sam Seung 35 sank west of Auckland after sending out a
distress signal at 3:20 a.m., Defense spokesman Peter Fry said. A
Royal New Zealand Air Force plane started a search of the area
shortly after dawn.
   More than 12 hours later, the Soviet fishing boat Druzbha picked
up three survivors who were clinging to floating wreckage amid
25-knot winds, said a spokeswoman for the National Rescue
Coordination Center.
   The Soviet vessel also recovered two bodies spotted by the plane.
   One survivor was badly burned, but the extent of his injuries
was not immediately known. There was no immediate word on why the
ship sank.

   Former hostage Frank Reed said
today he was held for months at a time with four other Westerners,
including two Americans, and that he is angry they have not been
freed.
   Reed was released to Syrian officials in Lebanon on Monday after
3{ years in the hands of Shiite Moslem fundamentalist kidnappers.
He is now at the U.S. Air Force Hospital in Wiesbaden for medical
tests and debriefings.
   ``I tell you, I'm very, very angry that Anderson ... Tom and
Terry ... are not free,'' 57-year-old Reed said from a hospital
balcony.
   Reed referred to Terry Anderson, The Associated Press chief
Middle East correspondent and the longest-held hostage in Lebanon,
and Thomas Sutherland, an American educator. Anderson was kidnapped
on March 16, 1985, while Sutherland was seized on June 9, 1985.
   ``For God's sake, it's nearly the sixth year for these men. I'm
absolutely embarrassed I'm out before they are,'' Reed said. ``I
spent two years wih Tom and Terry.''
   ``I have not seen Tom and Terry for awhile and I don't know
where they are,'' Reed said.
   Reed also said he spent three years in the intermittent company
of John McCarthy of Britain and Brian Keenan of Ireland. Reed said
he had been kept in the same house with them since October and the
three were also together periodically for three years.
   McCarthy, 33, a journalist for the London-based Worldwide
Television News agency, WTN, was kidnapped April 17, 1986 and
Keenan, 39, disappeared six days later. No group has claimed to be
holding either McCarthy or Keenan.
   Earlier, Reed's wife, Fahima, said her husband was kept with up
to six other Western hostages during his captivity.
   A special State Department team was to resume questioning Reed
for a second day today. They seek clues about the 16 remaining
Westerners held hostage in Lebanon, six of whom are American.
   Mrs. Reed, a 39-year-old Syrian Moslem, said that whenever a
hostage was taken away her husband thought that captive was being
freed. She said that upon his release, Reed was surprised and
angered to learn others remained captive.
   ``Our joy will not be complete until every single one of them is
free,'' Mrs. Reed told a news conference.
   While the educator underwent medical tests, Mrs. Reed disclosed
details of her husband's imprisonment. She said he was blindfolded
and bound for almost his entire captivity, except for 90 minutes
during the evenings.
   Mrs. Reed said during that time, Reed was allowed to watch
television or read magazines or books, but he refused. ``These
things were so trivial compared to the things that were snatched
away,'' she said.
   Mrs. Reed said her husband was ``moved around a lot.''
   Upon his release, Reed telephonedrelatives of several Western
hostages.
   In London, a group pressing for the release of McCarthy said
Reed told them of McCarthy and Keenan: ``They are both well. They
have some minor health problems. They exercise daily and read
voraciously.''
   Peggy Say, Anderson's sister, said Reed told her ``Terry was in
reasonably good health, although he had been having physical
problems ... He said Terry's attitude was still feisty, as far as
the guards go, and he was always screaming for something to read.''
   On Tuesday, Reed was flown from Damascus, Syria, to West Germany
for the medical tests and debriefings and was reunited with Fahima,
his second wife, and their 9-year-old son, Tarek.
   He celebrated freedom with a steak and a beer and showed no
initial signs of serious health problems, though doctors said he
lost ``significant weight and muscle mass'' during his 43 months in
captivity and felt tired and weak.
   A hospital statement said Reed would probably be at the hospital
``for the next two to three days.''
   The founder of a private school in Beirut, Reed was the second
American hostage to be freed in nine days. Robert Polhill, freed
April 22, went through the same battery of medical tests and
questioning last week.
   The Wiesbaden hospital has become the ritual stop for freed
American hostages on their way home. Hospital specialists are
experts at comforting freed hostages and helping them with
post-captivity psychological shocks.
   The first group of ex-captives to go through the Wiesbaden
hospital were 52 Americans held in Tehran until their release in
January 1981.
   At the time of his abduction Sept. 9, 1986, Reed ran the private
Lebanese International School, which he founded after the
International College had been bombed out.

   A drug can reverse the loss of vertebral bone and
prevent fractures in older women with osteoporosis, a common cause
of disability among the elderly, according to a study.
   Danish doctors who tested the medicine, called etidronate, found
that while it halted the loss of bone in the spine, it did not
affect bones in other parts of the body.
   An estimated 15 million to 20 million Americans have
osteoporosis. The condition is blamed for 1.3 million fractures
annually in people over age 45. It is especially common among older
women, when their bodies make less estrogen after menopause.
   The research, directed by Dr. Tommy Storm at Sundby Hospital in
Copenhagen, was published in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine. It was financed by Procter &amp; Gamble's Norwich Eaton
Pharmaceuticals, which makes etidronate.
   The doctors performed a three-year comparison study on 66 women
who ranged from age 56 to 75. When it was over, they found that the
vertebral bone mineral content of those who got the drug increased
7 percent. But it decreased 3 percent in a comparison group who got
dummy pills. The number of vertebral fractures also decreased
substantially in the etidronate group.
   ``Although we do not know whether the dose and treatment regimen
used in our study are optimal, our results are encouraging,'' the
researchers wrote.
   The medicine has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration for treatment of Paget's disease of bone.

   Legislators at an international conference on
the environment today passed a resolution calling for nations to
commit themselves to a 50 percent total reduction in global-warming
pollutants over the next 20 years.
   The legislators from 42 nations also called for other stepped-up
efforts to deal with the environment, including creation of a
``global Marshall plan'' to help developing countries cope with
environmental concerns.
   The three-day conference concluded with overwhelming approval of
a reduction timetable for global-warming pollutants pushed by the
U.S. congressional delegation which hosted the conference.
   The resolution contrasts with Bush administration policy, which
has advocated more research before specific pollution controls are
proclaimed.
   The resolutions and goals approved by the Interparliamentary
Conference on the Global Environment are not binding on any nation,
but some participants said they hoped to use the conference report
to sway fellow legislators back home about the need to take
specific actions on environmental matters.
   ``I hope that this is going to be the beginning, the beginning
in which we can have a global survival dialogue,'' Attiya
Inayatullah, a member of the Parliament of Pakistan, told reporters.
   More than 200 lawmakers from 42 nations including the Soviet
Union, most European countries, Japan and many developing nations
participated in the conference.
   The conference agreed to establish a broad range of
environmental goals, including actions aimed at protecting the
ozone layer, reversing the loss of forests and committing greater
resources to population control.
   The policy statements, however, provided few specifics on how
some of these efforts would be funded, including the proposed plan
by industrial nations to help developing countries deal with the
environment.
   This so-called ``global Marshall plan for sustainable
development and the environment'' would be patterned on the
post-World War II economic assistance efforts by the United States
that help European recover from the war, officials said.
   Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., one of the organizers, and other U.S.
delegates had pushed for a consensus in a closing policy
declaration that ``the time to act is now'' to deal with such
issues as global warming.
   One resolution that was approved calls for immediate action on
setting specific goals for reducing man-made pollutants, including
carbon dioxide, that cause global warming, or the greenhouse effect.
   ``Delay exposes us, our children and their children to
calamities which we will have made irrevocable by inaction in the
present,'' the draft resolution declared.
   The strong statement for action, drafted by the U.S. delegates
to the conference, is in sharp contrast to the Bush
administration's position that additional research into global
warming and its potential economic impact is needed before specific
pollution curbs should be set in concrete.
   Nevertheless, Gore and Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., stressed that
the gathering was not intended to embarrass President Bush. Two
weeks ago he caused rumblings among delegates to a White House
conference on global warming by emphasizing the need for study over
development of specific response strategies.
   In contrast, the legislative delegates drafted a global-warming
resolution that scarcely refers to the need for more research and
calls for setting a timetable for specific cuts in global warming
pollutants by the year 2010.
   The resolution calls for a roughly 20 percent reduction in
carbon dioxide, a product of burning fossil fuels; total
elimination of chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, and a variety of other
ozone-depleting chemicals; and a 10 percent reduction in methane
emissions.
   Altogether that would amount to about a 50 percent reduction in
global-warming pollutants by 2010.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers
throughout the country.
   April 26
   The Westerly (R.I.) Sun on Michael Milken:
   Michael R. Milken ... pleaded guilty to federal charges of
securities fraud and conspiracy and agreed (nice of him) to pay
fines and penalties of $600 million.
   That amount of money would seem to be indicative of one of the
most serious white-collar crimes of our time.
   For the crime of this significance, lawyers say he faces a
prison term that will not exceed five years.
   The fines and penalties seem as stiff as the prospective term is
lenient.

   The Arizona Republic, Phoenix, on the automobile industry:
   Not too long ago the American-made automobile was a cherished
symbol of national power and the envy of the world. Times have
changed. Today the U.S. auto industry is under siege, and those
shiny models of what was right with America have come to symbolize
what is wrong.
   The numbers tell the story. In 1960 General Motors, Ford and
Chrysler made more than half the world's cars. Today they account
for less than a third.
   What went wrong? The London Economist offers a simple answer:
``the Japanese.'' But more is involved than just the talents and
enterprise of Toyota, Honda and Nissan. Detroit's complacency,
along with what the Economist calls ``a string of badly designed,
badly made'' cars in the late '70s, invited disaster.
   The Japanese took advantage by raising quality and lowering
prices.
   By almost any measure, Detroit has improved. But so have the
Japanese, and at much lower cost, even though production has been
shifted to the United States. If Japanese car makers expand their
U.S. operations as expected, predicts the Brookings Institution,
110,000 new American jobs will be created by 1992.
   America's auto industry has used the import quotas, as the
Economist says, ``to fatten executives' bonuses and to help delay
painful reform.''
   Staring again into the face of economic death, Detroit has a
choice. It can learn from its competitors, streamline its
operations and become responsive to market demand, or it can stand
pat and anguish over the loss of the American edge.

   Los Angeles Daily News on the Camarena slaying:
   (N)o matter how important (the arrest of Dr. Humberto Alvarez
Machain to stand trial in Los Angeles in the 1985 torture-slaying
of Enrique Camarena of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration)
was to the DEA, the manner in which the agency reportedly brought
Alvarez into the United States, arranging his abduction by offering
a reward to Mexican kidnappers who seized him in Guadalara on April
2, was out of bounds.
   It subverted Mexico's legal process and violated that country's
sovereignty. ...
   While Mexico has been victimized by many acts of corruption, it
is insulting for the United States to treat its neighbor as though
it were so thoroughly and incorrigibly corrupt that American
authorities could not depend on it to bring criminals to justice
through legal channels.
   Furthermore, the United States cannot expect other nations to
follow due process of law _ which means, among other things, giving
fair treatment to American citizens suspected of crimes _ if it
goes on making end runs around Mexico's legal system.

   The Telegraph, Nashua, N.H., on Lithuania:.
   It looks like Lithuania has gotten the message. No country will
come to the Baltic country's defense in its present confrontation
with the Soviet Union. Not even the United States, which we all
know likes to sound off that there's nothing better on earth than
democracy and freedom.
   President Bush last week began by sounding tough on the Soviet
Union's plan to make Lithuania knuckle under by shutting off
supplies of oil, natural gas and other vital materials to the small
republic.
   But when the time came to enact trade sanctions against the
Soviets in support of Lithuania, Bush did a repeat of his Beijing
waltz. He finally declared it was not in the best interest of
further U.S.-Soviet Union peace moves to help Lithuania, despite
all his earlier sympathetic talk about Lithuania's desire for
independence.

   Las Cruces (N.M.) Sun-News on Lithuania:
   A lot of people want President George Bush to get tough with
Mikhail Gorbachev about Soviet pressure on tiny Lithuania. We think
Bush has been wise to adopt a cautious and restrained stance. He is
really not in a position to help Lithuania very much, but he could
do great damage to the progress toward democracy in Eastern Europe.
   We doubt that the most vocal critics of Bush's policy have
really thought much about the consequences if their advice was
followed. Some, we suspect, are just posturing in support of what
they conceive to be a popular cause.
   It is easy to sympathize with the Lithuanians, annexed by force
to a huge nation that oppressed and impoverished them. But in a
time of soaring expectations it is easy to expect too much.
   The peoples of Eastern Europe have made tremendous strides
toward freedom that were unimaginable little more than a year ago.
Things are moving swiftly in the right direction. It would be
unwise to throw a monkey wrench into the process at this point.
What would be gained by doing so?

   The News and Courier, Charleston, S.C., on Lithuania:
   By playing tough guy, Mikhail Gorbachev is winning important
points with Moscow hard-liners, who view any attempt to leave the
federation as a dire threat to the integrity of the USSR as a whole.
   President Bush's decision _ outward decision, that is _ to keep
hands-off gives ... Gorbachev carte blanche to do whatever is
necessary, short of invasion, to keep Lithuania in the fold.
   Helping ... Gorbachev maintain his political equilibrium may
satisfy Washington's geopolitical interests, but it does not
address the moral dilemma the United States faces. An angry
(Lithuanian) President Landsbergis raised serious questions when,
responding to ... Bush, he said: ``Can the freedom of one group of
people be sold for the freedom of another? What, then, is the idea
of freedom itself?''
   Surely these same questions were asked by congressional leaders
as they met ... with ... Bush prior to his announcement. The
president's answers obviously satisfied a broad cross-section of
America's political leaders. We hope, however, that what ... Bush
said was transmitted also to ... Landsbergis. At the very least, he
is owed that much.

<TEXT>
   The city of Watsonville, still trying
to recover from the October earthquake, has suffered another blow
when its third-largest food processor announced plans to lay off
370 workers.
   Green Giant Vegetables said the company will spend $3.4 million
to modernize its Watsonville plant, which employs 520, but cut
production in half.
   Green Giant will shift frozen cauliflower and broccoli
production to plants in the Midwest and Mexico, bringing the
production closer to markets in the East and Midwest, said plant
manager Duane Larson.
   But officials of Teamsters Local 912 said they believe the move
is related to Mexico's cheaper labor costs.
   The lowest-paid worker in the union earns $7.61 an hour, while
workers in Mexico earn less than $4 per day, said Sergio Lopez,
secretary-treasurer of Local 912.
   ``This couldn't have come at a worse time,'' said Lopez. ``After
the October 17 quake, this community was devastated. The loss of
more jobs will be horrible.''
   Green Giant, a unit of Grand Metropolitan PLC, plans to lay off
220 full-time workers and 150 seasonal workers early next year.

   The Parkersburg (W.Va.) News on racism:
   Professional baseball player Jose Canseco's claim he's a victim
of racism should outrage every American. ...
   Canseco plays ... for the Oakland Athletics. After signing a new
contract for the coming year, he had a few words to say to the
press. He was upset the A's didn't agree to pay him more. Canseco
is a Hispanic who came to the United States from Cuba. The reason
he didn't get a better contract is racism, opined Canseco.
   His contract is for $2 million. For one year.
   Various adjectives could be used to describe accurately a $2
million a year contract for a baseball player. ``Racist'' isn't one
of them.
   People who have been victims of racism should be enraged at
Canseco's idiotic, insensitive comment. Leaders of civil rights
groups fighting ... true racism should condemn Canseco for his
egotistical outburst. Baseball fans should display their
displeasure, perhaps by letting A's management know they don't
appreciate Canseco. Such expressions of concern might be
particularly appropriate coming from members of minorities who have
trouble scraping up the increasing price of admission to a
professional game.
   Racism? Hardly. With $2 million to invest and produce enough
income to keep him on easy street for the rest of his life, Canseco
never will experience some of the most difficult aspects of real
racism. That's a shame. It might make him more sensitive to the
plight of people who have real problems instead of imagined ones.

   The World, Coos Bay, Ore., on baseball:
   It's going to be interesting to see whether professional
baseball collapses under its own greed or survives to maintain its
place as America's favorite game of summer.
   Fresh on the heels of the ... strike-lockout this spring comes
news that television viewers across the nation are going to be
short on chances to watch their favorite games this summer. ...
   (T)he Saturday Game of the Week, an American tradition as deep
as hot dogs and Cracker Jacks, is gone. It was murdered in the
crossfire of a corporate bidding shoot-out between NBC and CBS. The
winner, CBS, plans to give sports fans only 16 games this season _
and it might have been only eight if the public hadn't complained.
...
   How long can baseball survive with fans who can only see
occasional games on regular TV or cable TV, or have to shell out
lots of money for a satellite system, or have to find time for
long-distance travel to a game?
   Baseball has been a game of the common man _ a slow summer
respite from the busy American lifestyle. Its history is one of
being open to all; exclusivity has never been a factor.
   But greed seems to be leading baseball astray.

   The Journal Times, Racine, Wis., on the America's Cup:
   Perhaps it was appropriate that the final decision on the winner
of the America's Cup, the Super Bowl of sailing, was made in a
courtroom far removed from the sea.
   It epitomized the fact that the America's Cup has been made a
mockery as a premier sailing event and _ like so many other sports
_ has become primarily a legal exercise.
   For the record, the New York ... Court (of Appeals), sitting in
Albany, awarded the America's Cup to the San Diego Yacht Club, in
effect ruling that the catamaran used in the last races was not an
illegal craft.
   The appeal of the San Diego Yacht Club victory had been filed by
the loser, New Zealand's Mercury Bay Club.
   The race was sailed in September 1988 and the outcome has been
filling lawyers' pockets ever since.
   So San Diego has the cup and we can look forward to another
America's Cup race in 1992. Supposedly, possession of the Cup is
vital to a city because it means millions of dollars in revenue to
the host city during the races.
   But we can't help wondering if the legal skirmishes, and the
ruling which pretty well opens the race to virtually any kind of
vessel, haven't severely tarnished the cup.
   We won't be surprised if, when 1992 comes around, many sailing
enthusiasts simply shrug and say, as we are tempted to, ``who
cares?''

   Freed U.S. hostage Frank Reed says he recently saw
Briton John McCarthy and Irishman Brian Keenan in captivity and
they were well, the Friends of John McCarthy said today.
   Reed telephoned McCarthy's father, Pat McCarthy, and his friend,
Jill Morrell, today and, according to the members of the group,
told them:
   ``They are both well. They have some minor health problems. They
exercise daily and read voraciously.''
   ``Mr. Reed said John had grown a beard and keeps fit by
performing squat thrusts and press-ups (push-ups), and as far as
his captors could be they are quite good. He is not being
tortured,'' said Joan Willows, a spokeswoman for the Friends of
John McCarthy. She said Reed, who was freed on Monday, last saw
McCarthy and Keenan on Saturday.
   Keenan's sister, Elaine Spence, said: ``I don't think the gut
feeling can be expressed. It is one of the happiest days you could
have. It makes us more determined to fight to eventually,
hopefully, to get Brian released.''
   His other sister, Brenda Gillam, said: ``It is the best hope we
have had in the whole four years'' since Keenan was kidnapped.
   Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie said Reed had no news of
his envoy, Terry Waite, 50, who disappeared Jan. 20, 1987, after
leaving his Beirut hotel to negotiate the release of hostages. No
group has claimed to be holding Waite.
   ``Even though Mr. Reed appears to have no direct news of Terry
Waite, I am encouraged both by the release of the two American
hostages and by the good news of Brian Keenan and John McCarthy,''
Runcie said in a statement.
   In interviews with BBC TV and radio, Ms. Morrell said Reed told
her McCarthy was kept blindfolded most of the time, but that he
``was getting news about the campaign (for his release) and was
getting the messages that we put to him in the newspaper in
Beirut.''
   ``It's just the best thing I've heard in four years. It's
amazing,'' she said.
   McCarthy, 33, a journalist for the London-based Worldwide
Television News agency, WTN, was kidnapped April 17, 1986, as he
drove to Beirut Airport to leave Lebanon.
   Keenan, 39, is from Belfast in British-ruled Northern Ireland.
An English language teacher at the American University in Beirut,
he disappeared while walking to work April 11, 1986. He is a dual
Anglo-Irish national, and was traveling on an Irish passport.
   No group has claimed to be holding either man.
   Another McCarthy supporter, Catherine Comerford, said Reed had
been with the two ``for quite some time, I'm not sure exactly how
long... he says that John is fit and well, and able to walk about
and do press-ups, have a bit of exercise, so he seems to be in good
shape.
   ``It is fantastic news. We've waited so long to hear anything as
concrete as this so obviously we're over the moon.''
   Ms. Morrell said she had spoken to the British Foreign Office
about the news and hoped the British government would now talk to
the Syrian and Iranian governments about releasing the hostages.
   ``If they (Britain) didn't know it before, then they certainly
know it now, that this is the way to go.''
   Britain has no diplomatic relations with Syria and Iran and says
it will do no deals for the release of the Britons missing in
Lebanon.
   Jack Mann, 75, an ex-pilot, has been missing in west Beirut
since May 12 last year. A group called the Cells of Armed Struggle
claimed that day to have kidnapped a Briton, but did not name him.
   Alec Collett, 68, a New York-based journalist was kidnapped
March 25, 1985. The Revolutionary Organization of Socialist
Moslems, believed linked to the Abu Nidal Palestinian terrorist
group, claimed to have executed him in April 1986 but no body was
found.

<TEXT>
   A conference on curing homosexuality
through sports and therapy has drawn fire from some health
professionals and gay activists who say homosexuality cannot cured
because it is not a disease.
   The Utah chapter of the National Association of Social Workers
voted 6-5 last week not to allow social workers who attend the
conference to receive academic ``continuing education'' credit for
doing so. The conference is set for Friday and Saturday.
   Evergreen Foundation, a group describing itself as a non-profit
organization of former homosexuals and friends, is sponsoring the
event.
   Evergreen president Alan Seegmiller, a licensed clinical social
worker, said organizers believe homosexuality is caused by ``a
gender inferiority complex originating in early childhood'' that
can be turned around if a homosexual wants to change.
   But psychiatrist R. Jan Stout said the American Psychiatric
Association dropped homosexuality as a mental disorder in 1973.
   ``No one knows the causes of homosexuality, but biological
factors seem to be the most important, whether you're homosexual or
heterosexual,'' Stout said. ``Most professionals have a consensus
view that psychological and social factors don't cause
homosexuality.''
   ``We no longer talk about treatments or cures for
homosexuality,'' said Stout. ``Homosexuals can change behavior
sometimes through will power but that doesn't change their sexual
orientation.''
   Robert Austin, Utah AIDS Foundation, said homosexuals will
explain their concerns during registration sessions, but they won't
be disruptive. ``You don't change people's minds by stopping
discussions,'' he said.
   Seegmiller said his group has no scientific studies to back up
the group's program ``because we're more interested in helping
people.'' He said he knows of at least six individuals who changed
their sexual preference from participating.
   Seegmiller said the group advocates therapy to deal with
``healing the inner child of the past.'' The organization also
sponsors activities traditionally associated with men, such as
basketball and softball.
   ``The men learn skills that enable them to participate in
athletic games they never learned before,'' said Seegmiller. ``Some
have found it helpful to seek training in automobile mechanics,
whatever they feel is a deficient in their role that seems helpful
to them.''

<DATELINE>RENO, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sunset Carson, a 1940s cowboy movie hero, died
one day after winning a settlement in a 3-year-old lawsuit over
money earned from some of his old pictures. He was 63.
   Carson died Tuesday at Washoe Medical Center after apparently
suffering a heart attack in his room at the Ponderosa Hotel.
   Carson, who was a rodeo star at age 17, appeared in more than 40
westerns, including ``Bandits of the Badlands,'' ``Oregon Trail''
and ``Bells of Rosarita.''
   In 1978, he created a series of 78 classic westerns featuring
himself and other stars like Ken Maynard and Roy Rogers.
   He filed suit in 1987 complaining that South Carolina
Educational Television Producers Inc. and Ken Heard Releasing Inc.
helped in the production and distribution of the ``Six Gun Heroes''
series but had not paid him for video cassette sales and
promotional materials sold on the show since 1982.
   Carson's Reno attorney, Larry Dunn, said the lawsuit was settled
out of court in Carson's favor Monday. Dunn would not give a money
amount.
   Carson had spent recent years crusading against drugs and
violence, and sex and language in movies and on television.
   He is survived by his wife, Jeanne, a son and a daughter.

   West German opposition leader Oskar

a woman stabbed him in the neck during an election rally.
   ``My first thanks go to all those people who helped me get over
the attack,'' Lafontaine, the 46-year-old Social Democratic
candidate for chancellor, told reporters when he left the
University Clinic in Cologne.
   The woman who stabbed Lafontaine, Adelheid Streidel, has been
sent to a psychiatric clinic. Officials said she has had a history
of mental disorders.
   Lafontaine, governor of Saarland state, said he would continue
his recuperation at home and would not resume his duties until
later.
   Doctors said Lafontaine's wound was healing well but urged him
not to work until he is fully recovered. Lafontaine plans to
challenge Chancellor Helmut Kohl in West Germany's federal
elections in December.

<DATELINE>ST. REGIS INDIAN RESERVATION, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State police sealed
off a Mohawk reservation to outsiders and posted officers to keep
the peace today after two Indians were shot to death in a
9-month-old battle over casino gambling.
   The slayings were the first fatalities in the dispute that has
torn apart the 14,000-member reservation with gunfire and arson. Up
to 600 Mohawks fled to a refugee center in Ontario last week after
a week of nightly violence.
   ``We're trying to maintain some type of stability,'' state
police Capt. Richard Garrant said today. ``We're trying to ease
some of the tension.''
   Early Tuesday, 22-year-old Matthew Pyke, a casino opponent, was
slain while walking in the reservation in Snye, Quebec, during a
gun battle between pro- and anti-gambling factions. The reservation
straddles the U.S.-Canadian border.
   Later Tuesday, J.R. Edwards, 30, a member of the pro-gambling
Warriors Society, was found dead next to his house, not far from
where Pyke was shot.
   In response, Gov. Mario Cuomo sent more than 100 state police
troopers to escort 95 to 100 Canadian police through the New York
section of the reservation.
   At a late morning news conference, Cuomo said he has also
ordered National Guard troops to be on standby. Canadian military
and some New York National Guard units provided support services
Tuesday night, but ``no military force was used,'' Cuomo said.
   Asked why he was not sending the National Guard onto the U.S.
portion of the reservation, Cuomo said: ``My position is we will
not send in the military force because of the risk of bloodshed.''
   Cuomo said one of his aides, Henrick Dullea, was en route to the
reservation to meet with Mohawk leaders, Cuomo said. Negotiations
to settle the dispute could begin as early as next week, he said.
   Late Tuesday, police sealed off all roads leading onto the
reservation but later permitted residents to enter on the condition
they stay in their homes.
   Garrant said an unspecified number of troopers would remain
stationed throughout the reservation until formal negotiations
between the governor's office and the Indians begin.
   ``The whole community is being held hostage,'' said Diane
Lazores, spokeswoman for the Warrior Society. She said hundreds of
troopers were stationed in the reservation and were not allowing
Indians to move about. She said people weren't allowed back on the
the reservation to deliver food.
   ``We have a hundred people here who haven't eaten in 18 hours,''
she said.
   Garrant denied Lazores' accusations. ``They say a lot of
things,'' he said.
   Although there have been nightly confrontations between Indian
factions, including a hand grenade attack on a Mohawk police
station last week that injured three people, state police have
seldom entered the reservation.
   Police had treated the dispute as an internal matter. Some
Indian leaders consider the reservation sovereign territory over
which only Mohawks have law enforcement powers.
   ``Thousands of rounds go off every night here,'' said Rudy Hart,
who owns a duty-free store on the reservation. ``It got to the
point where people thought somebody had to die. Nobody's willing to
compromise. They won't give in.''
   The issue of gambling on the reservation has been at the center
of escalating violence since last summer, when an FBI-led gambling
raid triggered a 12-day standoff between a pro-gambling group and
state police.
   The FBI had claimed the Mohawks had violated federal gaming
regulations; the Mohawks claim they are not bound by state or
federal gambling laws.
   Pro-gambling forces say the reservation's six casinos, which
draw busloads of patrons from the Northeast with their slot
machines, craps tables and other games, are an economic boon.
Opponents argue they encourage prostitution and drug use and
threaten traditional ways.
   Anti-gamblers blamed the Warriors Society, an armed group, for
the first slaying and said Cuomo had let the situation get out of
hand.
   ``After my house has been shot at and two deaths, now is the
time for the governor to get off of his fingers,'' said Barbara
Montour.
   ``Governor Cuomo finally woke up and realized that there are
some grave afflictions here,'' said Barbara Barnes, a spokeswoman
for the anti-gambling faction.
   Minnie Garrow, answering calls at the Warriors' headquarters,
denied the group was responsible for the slaying and added, ``We
feel badly about the loss of life.''
   Last summer, a mob of angry anti-gamblers burned down a casino.
Sporadic shootings and other violence were reported in the fall and
winter, but tensions mounted in March when gambling opponents
blockaded roads leading to the reservation to keep outsiders away
from the high-stakes casinos.
   Last week pro-gamblers tore down the blockades in a hail of
gunfire. The first injuries came Thursday when one of the barricade
leaders was beaten and suffered a fractured skull.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Budget Committee today adopted a
Democratic-proposed $1.2-trillion budget for 1991 that cuts defense
spending $9.9 billion below what President Bush wants.
   The package was adopted on a vote of 14-9, with all of the
committee's Democrats joined by a single Republican _ Sen. Charles
Grassley, R-Iowa, in voting for the measure.
   The proposal mirrors the plan passed by the
Democratic-controlled House Tuesday. Both packages are seen by many
lawmakers as a prelude to possible negotiations between the White
House and the Democratic majorities in Congress on a spending plan
for the next fiscal year.
   Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn., said the budget
would address ``a new era in which economic vitality will be the
true measure of strength of the nation, rather than just solely
military strength.''
   The proposal would set defense spending at $293.9 billion in the
fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. That is $9.9 billion less than the
figure Bush has proposed and about $2 billion below this year's
spending.
   The proposal claims to reduce next year's deficit by $43 billion
by taking credit for $13 billion in defense cuts, $13.9 billion in
new tax revenues, and $6.2 billion in new user fees and other
receipts. The growth of benefit programs such as Medicare would be
slowed by $5.6 billion while other domestic and foreign aid efforts
would be cut by $3.5 billion.
   The Senate action came a day after the House adopted its own
Democratic-written budget on a party-line vote that also attacks
Bush's defense programs.
   With all 174 voting Republicans oposing the package, the House
adopted its own $1.24 trillion spending plan on a 218-208 vote.
   The plan's key contrast with Bush's proposal was its defense
figure: $295.5 billion, $8.3 billion less than the president. It
also spent more for social programs than the president requested.
   Republicans accused Democrats of forcing through a plan that
excessively weakens American military power.
   ``All you have to do is say, `I'm really mad about Lithuania and
I'll prove it. I'm going to gut the Navy,''' said Rep. Newt
Gingrich of Georgia, the No. 2 House GOP leader.
   But Democrats said their proposal merely acknowledged the
obvious: the Cold War has eased and it is time for the government
to focus on domestic issues.
   ``The key problems we face as a nation are addressed in this
budget,'' said House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash.
   After the vote, Democratic leaders said they viewed their budget
as a strong bargaining position for future talks with the Senate
and the administration.
   Foley, House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif.,
and others conceded that negotiations with the administration will
be needed for the budget's priorities to be translated into future
spending and tax laws. The budget merely maps the government's
fiscal plans.
   The House-passed package claims to slice $36 billion off the
deficit, relying on defense cuts, $13.9 billion in new taxes and
other savings.
   This allows it to meet the Gramm-Rudman law's requirement of a
1991 deficit of no more than $64 billion.
   Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney ordered a review of 207
military projects for possible cancellation. He complained that
some members of Congress ``want to cut the defense budget even as
they plead to save the projects in their own states and districts.''
   Cheney also extended a worldwide freeze on military construction
projects _ affecting $7 billion in new contracts _ until June 15.

   Maronite Catholic religious leaders
appealed for a maritime cease-fire Wednesday as rival Christian
forces fired on passenger ferries near each other's ports.
   Police said no casualties were reported in the latest round of
fighting.
   The ferries, which operate out of Cyprus, provide the only
regular link to the outside world for Christians trapped in their
310-square-mile enclave north of Beirut, which is ringed by hostile
Syrian troops and their mainly Moslem militia allies.
   On Wednesday, rebel troops loyal to Gen. Michel Aoun and the
Lebanese Forces militia led by Samir Geagea continued their
maritime battle, the latest flareup in their 3-month-old power
struggle for control of the Christian enclave.
   A police spokesman said an armed speedboat manned by Lebanese
Forces militiamen intercepted the Virgin Butterly, a hydrofoil
ferry, before dawn Wednesday off of Aoun's only sea outlet, the
makeshift port of Dbaye, seven miles north of Beirut.
   The spokesman, who cannot be identified under existing
regulations, said the militiamen did not try to seize the
hydrofoil, but fired warning shots from a 14.5mm machine gun to
prevent it from heading for Aoun's port.
   The spokesman said the Virgin Butterfly was not hit by the
gunfire, but sailed back to the Cyprian port of Larnaca.
   Aoun's gunners responded by shelling another ferry, the Sunny
Boat, as it waited to pick up passengers in the Geagea-controlled
port of Jounieh, five miles north of Dbaye.
   The Sunny Boat raced for the open sea as shells exploded in the
water around it, the police spokesman said. There were no reports
that the ship had been hit.
   The maritime fighting has flared up since Geagea imposed a naval
blockade April 23 on the three-mile stretch of coast controlled by
Aoun in a bid to prevent seaborne supplies of weapons and
ammunition from reaching the general's forces.
   Geagea's militia, with 6,000 fighters and 30,000 reservists, has
one gunboat and about 20 speedboats armed with machine guns and
rocket launchers.
   Aoun's 19,000-man army lost most of its naval force when
Geagea's forces seized the naval base at Jounieh in February. The
general has two crippled gunboats trapped near Dbaye.
   The ferry attacks prompted Maronite Catholic religious leaders
to seek a maritime cease-fire.
   To that end, Bulos Naaman, former head of the Order of Maronite
Monks, met with Aoun and planned to see Geagea later, radio
stations reported.
   Naaman refused to comment to reporters after his meeting with
Aoun.
   By police count, 920 people have been killed and 2,448 wounded
since Jan. 30 when the inconclusive battle began between Geagea's
militia and Aoun's troops, the worst conflict between Christians in
Lebanon's 15-year-old civil war.
   Aoun has refused to recognize the Syrian-backed government of
President Elias Hrawi, objecting to the 40,000 Syrian troops in
Lebanon. Geagea supports the Hrawi government.
   On Wednesday, the rival Christian forces dueled with howitzers
and mortars in east Beirut and Kesrouan Province to the north.
   But the fighting did not spread to the shell-shattered resort
town of Kleiat in the mountains northeast of Beirut where civilians
have staged a sit-in under a huge tent in the main square to
protest further violence.
   The sit-in began Tuesday evening after the expiration of an
81-hour cease-fire called by the Maronite church to allow local
townspeople to salvage what was left of their property.

<HEAD>Los Angeles Mayor Proposes Water Rationing; Surcharge for Excess
Use</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE V. BIGELOW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Tom Bradley today proposed a water
rationing program that would require citizens to cut water use 10
percent below 1986 levels to cope with the fourth year of drought
in California.
   The measures Bradley has asked the City Council in the nation's
second largest city to adopt include penalties in the form of
surcharges for excess water use, and hiring of more Department of
Water and Power employees if needed to enforce the cutbacks.
   The mayor proposes to change the city's five-phase drought
ordinance. The city has been in phase 1 _ voluntary water
conservation _ since 1988, but there has been little compliance.
   Modifications to phase 2, which requires mandatory conservation,
include: a recommended $3 surcharge per billing unit plus 15
percent of the water bill; allowing DWP to assess penalties for
chronic violators and installation of flow restricters and service
shutoff; having customers use 1986 as the base year for determining
at what level each household will conserve water.
   Under existing law a City Council resolution is needed to
implement the penalty aspects of the ordinance.
   The Bradley plan was outlined today in a statement from the
mayor's office prior to a news conference at City Hall.
   Last month, Bradley called for a voluntary 10 percent cutback in
water use. But he told reporters on Monday that ``the public has
not gotten the message,'' and said he was determined to ``go
forward with a water-rationing program.''
   A plan involving possible fines for violators would mark the
most drastic step yet to confront a water shortage estimated at 10
percent by the regional Metropolitan Water District.
   ``This may well set the tone'' for Southern California, said
Carl Boronkay, MWD general manager. ``I think the mayor is taking a
leadership position.''
   The MWD supplies 60 percent of all water to Los Angeles and the
six-county area stretching from the Mexican border to Ventura
County. Like other agencies, its water supplies have been reduced
by the fourth consecutive year of drought in California.
   City water officials have said it could take several months to
get a rationing plan rolling.

   The door-to-door portion of the 1990 census
spreads out to the nation's smaller cities and towns Thursday.
   Census workers who began their household count in 110 larger
cities April 26 are expanding to the remaining 374 census districts
across the country, according to bureau spokesman Ray Bancroft.
   Only about 63 percent of the nation's households have returned
census forms mailed in late March. The bureau had hoped for a 70
percent response and the shortfall will raise the price of the
count by millions of dollars because of the expanded door-to-door
effort.
   The national count every 10 years is required by the
Constitution for use in reapportioning seats in the House of
Representatives. The figures also are used to apportion seats in
state legislatures and divide hundreds of billions of dollars in
federal and state aid.
   Minority groups say past counts have missed more poor and
minorities than whites and higher income people.
   Lower educational and income levels, larger household sizes and
the more frequent presence of distant relatives in households are
major factors in these undercounts, population analyst David J.
Fein said in Demography, the journal of the Population Association
of America.
   Fein, of Abt Associates in Bethesda, Md., estimated that as many
as 15 percent of Puerto Ricans, 12 percent of blacks and 9 percent
of Mexican Americans were omitted in the 1980 census.
   Census Bureau figures were lower than that, but the agency did
estimate that while it missed about 1.4 percent of all Americans
the rate may have been as high as 6 percent for young black men.
   The possibility of adjusting the 1990 figures to account for
this undercount has been proposed and debated by politicians and
statisticians. The Commerce Department, parent agency of the Census
Bureau, has said it is trying to do a complete count and will
consider adjustment only after the basic census effort is done.
   A coalition of cities and interest groups has filed suit against
the bureau seeking to force a statistical adjustment of the final
census figures.
   Forms for millions of Americans were delayed by addressing
mistakes, while millions of others simply haven't mailed theirs
back. The problems, including large apartment buiildings and whole
blocks and small towns seemingly overlooked, have drawn heavy
criticism for the census bureau.
   In the last few decades the system of mailing census
questionnaires and asking people to return them has become common
practice. It replaced the traditional, but labor-intensive process
of having someone visit every home.
   Now, the door-to-door count is reserved for sparsely populated
areas and follow-up on people who don't answer by mail.
   Originally expected to cost $1.3 billion this year, the price of
counting Americans could well increase by $180 million or more,
according to congressional sources.
   In rural areas, which were not included in the mailed portion of
the count, personal visits by census takers have been going on
since March.

<HEAD>Former HUD Official Says Bush's Office Helped Get 1985 HUD Grant</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: SUBS 5th graf pvs, Gilliam said... to CORRECT spelling of
Barreto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former federal housing official, who admits
taking bribes, testified today that a federal HUD grant was
arranged for a project after its developer appealed to then-Vice
President George Bush.
   DuBois L. Gilliam, an imprisoned former deputy assistant
secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development,
resumed testimony today about scandals at HUD and described in
detail how officials there steered projects to political friends,
including members of Congress.
   Gilliam, who is serving an 18-month federal prison sentence, was
testifying under a court grant of immunity from further prosecution.
   Under questioning by Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., chairman of the
House panel investigating HUD, Gilliam said HUD officials engaged
in a grant swap in order to provide $500,000 requested in 1985 to
conduct a feasibility study for a Hispanic trade center in Kansas
City, Mo.
   Gilliam said that Hector Barreto, then president of the U.S.
Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, sought a HUD grant for the project,
but that he first told Barreto it was not qualified under Secretary
Samuel R. Pierce Jr.'s discretionary fund for special projects.
   He said he got a call that afternoon from Deborah Gore Dean,
assistant to Pierce, saying Barreto had met with Bush and that
``she had received a call from the vice president's staff asking
about the grant, and indicated her desire to try to help get the
project funded.''
   As a result, Gilliam said, he persuaded a Kansas City assistant
city manager to provide the grant from the city's Community
Development Block Grant funds, provided by HUD, and that in turn he
arranged to have a special grant go to Kansas City to replace that
money.
   ``In other words, let's make a deal _ you do this and I'll do
this,'' Gilliam said.
   He did not name the person in the vice president's office.
Gilliam said he was unclear about the connection to Bush's office,
but said Dean had ``indicated something ... about Mr. Barreto going
on the vice president's plane.''
   Lantos, before the meeting, described the case this way: ``We
will hear testimony from Mr. Gilliam about special projects _ how a
particular project was funded at the request of `someone' in the
office of the vice president, in order to get a Hispanic leader to
accompany the then-vice president on a plane trip to Puerto Rico.''
   Once a trusted assistant to Pierce during the Reagan
administration, Gilliam painted a picture of rampant political
abuse at the agency during his initial appearance before the House
Governmental Operations subcommittee on employment and housing.
   His second round of testimony involved so-called HUD ``special
project'' grants, which were made from the secretary's
discretionary fund.
   The program was established to provide aid in cases of natural
disasters and other unexpected needs, without a competitive
application process. Subcommittee staff director Stuart Weisberg
said before today's hearing that although the money was
administered at the secretary's discretion, political use of the
fund would constitute an abuse.
   ``Discretion does not mean political,'' Weisberg said. ``There
was no intent (by Congress) that it be treated like a political
action committee ... to reward political friends.''
   On Monday, Gilliam disputed Pierce's assertion before the panel
last year and in a subsequent magazine interview that he didn't
decide who got federal grants and was a hands-off administrator.
   Gilliam said Pierce himself ordered federal grants for
particular projects. He said Pierce kept notes of which members of
Congress and political friends supported projects, which he used
when funding decisions were made.
   His testimony was the first by a top HUD insider in more than a
year of investigation by the panel into allegations of fraud,
influence-peddling and political favoritism at the department.
   Gilliam pleaded guilty to felony charges of accepting illegal
gratuities while at HUD and conspiring to manipulate a housing
grant to benefit friends.
   Pierce's attorneys attacked Gilliam's testimony as motivated by
a desire for early release from prison. Attorney Paul L. Perito
accused Lantos' subcommittee of an ``insatiable appetite for
publicity.''
   Gilliam's testimony was not the first time Bush's name has
arisen indirectly in the HUD scandal.
   A former New York regional official of HUD, Alexander Naclerio,
testified last fall that he had been sent by HUD officials to visit
and facilitate funding of a Puerto Rico project proposed for a
federal grant and that he understood that its developer, Delio
Rojo, was a prominent backer of Bush.

   Parents and teen-agers cried and held
hands and counselors were placed on 24-hour call as a shocked
community attempted to recover from the apparent suicides of three
high school students in two days.
   Counselors were assigned to every classroom at Sheridan High
School today after a 17-year-old was found dead of a gunshot wound
Tuesday.
   On Monday, two of his classmates shot themselves to death. One
of them killed himself in front of a history class after professing
his love for a girl.
   Scott Stamper, 16, said the latest suicide shook up most
students. ``People who didn't even know him were crying,'' he said.
``It was quiet. I walked in school today and saw zombies.''
   ``I can't tell you how tough it's been,'' school Superintendent
David Robinson said.
   Lisa Deal, 18, a senior and president of the student council,
said the mood at the campus was better today. But, she said, the
community still has a long way to go.
   ``It's scary knowing your friends ... would go to these
extremes,'' she said. Ms. Deal said she was an acquaintance the two
students who died Monday.
   The body of the latest victim, Jerry Paul McCool, a 17-year-old
sophomore, was discovered in his home by his father Tuesday.
   His family said they thought the shooting was accidental, but
Lt. Lenard Lewis of the Saline County sheriff's office said the
county coroner, Sam Ballard, and other officials believe McCool's
death was a suicide. The state medical examiner's office was
expected to make a formal ruling later today.
   ``The mother, talking to the neighbors, was a little upset and
said it was an accident and he was cleaning his gun,'' Lewis said.
``There wasn't anything there to indicate he was cleaning his gun.
Everything appears it was suicide. The family doesn't want to
accept it.''
   Hours after the shooting, parents and students packed the
school's 1,000-seat auditorium to discuss the suicides. Some held
hands. Some cried.
   Robinson said school would go on because routine is important
``when things begin to crumble. They need something to hang on
to.'' Today, he said that meetings this morning between students
and counselors were helping calm the situation because the students
``were able to express their feelings.''
   In addition to calling in counselors, school officials also
handed out a list of phone numbers for nearly three dozen
counselors and faculty members on call around the clock.
   ``Our community and our school is just in the middle of a
tremendous tragedy that we're all trying to deal with and get a
handle on and improve,'' Robinson said.
   McCool's death was the fourth suicide in little more than a
month by high school students in the community of about 3,000,
about 25 miles south of Little Rock. A 17-year-old killed himself
March 28, authorities said.
   ``It's just too much for a town like this. This is something you
hear about in a big city,'' said Ethel Sanders, a police clerk.
   Police said the two students who died Monday had at least one
class together and had been friends for years. Thomas Smith, 17,
shot himself after declaring his love for a girl. Thomas M.
Chidester, 19, was killed by a shot to the head late Monday.
   Lewis said McCool knew the other boys but was not in any of
their classes. He had spoken with his father about the boys'
suicides.
   ``His Dad said he said something like, `How could somebody do
that? Why would they do it?''' Lewis said.
   McCool had stayed home from school Tuesday, complaining of pain
from a hernia operation two weeks ago, Lewis said. The boy was at
school Monday when Smith killed himself but wasn't in the classroom
where the shooting occurred.
   Sheriff Cary Clark said the deaths of Chidester and Smith
appeared connected. Both teen-agers participated in the school's
junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps and were classmates for
several years.
   Chidester's body was found Tuesday by his grandmother, who lived
with him. He apparently died Monday night, leaving a note that
read, ``I can't go on any longer,'' Clark said.
   The grandmother told police that Chidester was upset that he
couldn't get to Smith after the shooting. Police and teachers held
him back, Clark said.
   ``It's not a police problem. It's not a school problem. It's a
community problem,'' said Police Chief David Hooks, ``and we've all
got to stick together.''

<HEAD>Subcommittee Votes to Raise Penalty-Free Earnings Limit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House Ways and Means subcommittee voted
Wednesday to allow people aged 65 through 69 to earn more money
without losing any of their Social Security benefits.
   A bill approved by the Social Security subcommittee also
includes a provision removing the Social Security Administration
from the Department of Health and Human Services and creating it as
an independent agency. That provision is opposed by the Bush
administration.
   The legislation also would require the Social Security
Administration to improve telephone access to local offices. The
administration cut local telephone service last year, preferring to
rely on a nationwide toll-free number for most beneficiary problems.
   The proposed increase in the amount Social Security recipients
may earn without losing benefits is considerably less generous than
tax-writing committees of the House and Senate approved last year.
Congressional Republicans have made outright repeal of the earnings
limitation a top goal, contending it reduces incentives for older
Americans to work.
   Present law allows a person aged 65 through 69 to earn up to
$9,360 this year without penalty. Each $3 earned above that amount
reduces Social Security benefits by $1.
   An automatic inflation adjustment built into the law will raise
the limit to $9,960 next year and to $10,440 in 1992. The bill
approved without dissent by the subcommittee would raise the
figures to $10,200 in 1991 and $10,920 in 1992.
   The bill makes no change in the $6,840 earnings limit on people
under age 65. Neither does it affect those 70 or older; they could
continue to earn an unlimited amount without losing any Social
Security benefit.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas dynamited
power stations and attacked strategic targets in the capital early
today to protest human rights violations they blame on the armed
forces.
   The attacks began shortly before midnight Tuesday and faded
after several hours of pre-dawn fighting. The armed forces said it
suffered five dead and six wounded, and that 12 civilians were also
wounded.
   Half the city was without electricity and automatic weapons fire
and explosions ripped through several neighborhoods, including the
wealthy Escalon district.
   Rebels had dynamited five high-voltage utility towers and a
power plant on nearby San Salvador volcano, the privately owned
YSKL radio station reported.
   There was no fighting in the capital during the morning, but
skirmishing was reported in several areas outside the capital,
including the town of Ilobasco, 40 miles to the northeast. No
casualty figures were available.
   The attacks were a protest of ``the total immunity that exists
in this country for members of the armed forces who violate human
rights,'' the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front guerrillas
said in a statement sent by fascimile.
   The statement cited the ``stalled investigation and evident
cover-up of the intellectual authors of the crime against the
Jesuits,'' referring to the killings of six Jesuit priests at
Central American University in November.
   President Alfredo Cristiani has admitted the six priests,
including the university rector, were killed by members of the
armed forces, but critics have said the investigation should go
farther.
   One high officer, Col. Guillermo Benavides, has been charged in
the killings of the Jesuits, along with three lieutenants and five
soldiers.
   Despite years of death-squad killings, no officer has ever been
convicted in a human rights-related crime.
   The House Foreign Affairs committee voted last week to cut U.S.
military aid to El Salvador in half from $85 million. The other
half would be cut if the government fails to properly investigate
the Jesuit killings or negotiate in good faith with the guerrillas.
   The attacks also appeared timed to coincide with the scheduled
start of preliminary peace talks today.
   Indirect preliminary talks were to begin today between
Cristiani's rightist government and the guerrillas.
   A presidential spokesman said a representative of U.N.
General-Secretary Javier Perez de Cuellar was expected to arrive
today to act as a go-between in setting up an agenda and arranging
other details for the negotiations.
   The guerrilla statement said they were still disposed to
``continue with the negotiating process.''
   The first guerrilla attack _ on the power line towers _ began at
about 10 p.m. Tuesday, hours after about 40,000 people attended a
huge May Day rally organized by labor unions and opposition parties
to criticize Cristiani's economic austerity program and urge peace
talks.
   At the peaceful rally, militant leftists joined the moderate
Christian Democrats whom Cristiani succeeded in one of the largest
opposition protests in a decade.
   Guerrillas shot it out with government soldiers near the hotel
in Escalon where Americans had been trapped for a time during the
November offensive and the gunfight spilled over into the Tasumal
neighborhood, residents there said.
   Attempts to negotiate an end to the war ended in deadlock in
1984 and 1985, and a series of direct talks began shortly after
Cristiani was sworn in as president in July.
   They broke off as a result of the monthlong November offensive.
   More than 72,000 people have been killed, most of them
civilians, since the war began in October 1979.

<HEAD>Mecham Campaign Office Damaged By Arson Fire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Someone set former Gov. Evan Mecham's
campaign headquarters on fire this morning, causing an estimated
$35,000 in damage, officials said.
   ``It's very suspicious the fact that nobody was around when we
got here. It's definitely not electrical,'' Glendale Fire Capt.
Kevin Pool said. ``We're calling it arson.''
   Mecham, a Republican who was removed from office by impeachment
conviction two years ago, said he doubted there was a political
connection.
   ``I don't think we can draw any conclusions of that kind at
all,'' Mecham said.
   ``It was arson, but there has been a couple of houses set on
fire out here in northwest Phoenix,'' he added.
   In April 1988, the state Senate convicted Mecham of obstructing
an investigation of a death threat against an aide and of loaning
his auto dealership $80,000 from a protocol fund.
   His removal from the governorship after less than 1{ years in
office capped one of the stormiest tenures in Arizona history. He
is now attempting to make a political comeback.
   He said the quick work of firefighters limited interior damage,
although there was heavy damage to the roof of the
7,300-square-foot building, his former residence.
   Investigators said three spots outside the building had been
blackened, indicating three starting points for the fire. There was
no evidence of burglary, police said.
   A newspaper carrier for The Arizona Republic spotted smoke near
the entrance of the structure about 3:15 a.m., Pool said.
Firefighters had the blaze under control by 4 a.m.
   The property, appraised at about $500,00 by a real estate
information service, faces foreclosure unless Mecham works out a
settlement with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. An auction on
the property is set for May 18.
   Mecham said he had no idea who would want to burn his
headquarters, which also is home of FAZPAC, a political action
committee, and MP Press, a publishing arm of Mecham's campaign.
   He called the arson a minor setback and predicted that his sixth
campaign for governor would rebound. He ran unsuccessfully four
times before winning the office in November 1986.

   The Department of Veterans Affairs opened the
door Wednesday to independent scrutinity of its effort to determine
whether there is a link between exposure to Agent Orange and a
variety of diseases.
   The offer follows years of challenges to the credibility of the
VA, Centers for Disease Control and the Defense Department. Critics
have charged the government with ignoring the scientific evidence
of a connection between exposure and cancers and other diseases.
   The offer came during testimony by VA Deputy Secretary Anthony
J. Principi before a House Veterans Affairs subcommittee.
   Principi told the subcommittee on compensation, pension and
insurance that the department would agree to a review by the
National Academy of Sciences, to having its own panel of outside
scientific advisers enlarged, or to subjecting its work to outside
review.
   Two Agent Orange compensation bills pending in Congress call for
establishment of a scientific review procedure through the National
Academy, an independent group of scientists that advises the
government.
   ``Should Congress conclude that the process would be lent
credibility by our consulting with additional outside experts ...
we would be pleased to do so if that kind of consultation would not
unduly delay our progress,'' Principi said.
   But Principi also asked the subcommittee to put off
consideration of a compensation bill. The bill would award
service-connected disability payments to Vietnam War veterans who
contend they suffer due to exposure from one of four kinds of
cancer or from a skin disease known as chloracne.
   The bill would also pave the way to compensation for other
ailments as the evidence comes in.
   Principi asked that the law be held in abeyance until the VA
comes up with final regulations Oct. 1 on who should be compensated
and for what diseases. Those regulations depend in part on the
recommendations of VA's Advisory Committee on Environmental
Hazards, a 15-member panel of scientists and lay persons.
   The committee meets later this month.
   Veterans Affairs Secretary Edward J. Derwinski has appointed his
personal adviser on the Agent Orange issue, retired Adm. Elmo
Zumwalt, to fill a vacancy on the committee. Zumwalt ordered
spraying of Agent Orange during Vietnam and also lost a son who
served in Vietnam to cancer.
   ``We have, I believe, more than demonstrated our good faith,''
Principi said, saying the VA set its course a year ago when it
decided against appealing a federal judge's order that it draft new
Agent Orange regulations.
   But the House sponsor of the compensation bill, Rep. Lane Evans,
D-Ill., suggested the VA was trying to further postpone delivering
benefits to veterans. There is no guarantee the department will
decide to award compensation in its final rules.
   ``I think you are proceeding on a good-faith basis, but I
believe the veterans who suffer from Agent Orange can't wait,'' he
said.
   Evans' bill would compensate exposed veterans who suffer from
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, soft-tissue sarcoma, melanoma, and basal
cell carcinoma, as well as chloracne. The measure is expected to
cost $89 million a year.
   About 35,000 veterans have filed claims asserting a connection
between exposure to Agent Orange and a host of ailments. Only a
handful of benefits have been granted, for those suffering
chloracne.
   Dioxin, labeled by the Environmental Protection Agency as a
``probable human carcinogen,'' is suspected as the primary but not
the only ingredient causing ailments among veterans exposed to
Agent Orange.

<HEAD>Wisconsin to Apologize for 1832 Massacre of Sac and Fox Indians</HEAD>

   For years, only a plain, iron historical
marker has stood at the site of the 1832 Bad Axe Massacre, where
hundreds of Indian warriors, women and children were chased into
the Mississippi River and shot.
   Now, the state, facing unrest over relations with the Chippewa,
is apologizing to the Sac and Fox Indian Nation, who according to
one historian endured ``one of the bloodiest tragedies in the sad
history of American-Indian relations.''
   The apology, to be issued Saturday, finally ``recognizes the
mistakes of the past,'' said Sister Toni Harris, a Roman Catholic
nun and member of the Indian rights group Honor Our Neighbors
Origins and Rights.
   ``If we recognize what was done in the past, we make different
choices for the future,'' Ms. Harris said. ``A failure to
recognize, whether it's the Holocaust or other kinds of
abominations of people against people, only threatens the
possibility of repeating those abominations.''
   HONOR, based in Milwaukee, urged the Legislature last year to
pass the resolution formally apologizing for the Army's action on
Aug. 1-2, 1832.
   State Rep. David Clarenbach hopes Saturday's ceremony in the
village of Victory _ named by residents years ago to celebrate the
massacre _ could set a ``very important tone'' for resolving a
modern-day dispute with Wisconsin's six Chippewa Indian bands.
   ``The purpose of this kind of reconciliation is to draw strength
from a new bond that replenishes old distrust,'' said Clarenbach,
who sponsored the apology approved by the Legislature last October.
   Tribal leaders from the Sac and Fox Nation in Iowa, Oklahoma and
Kansas have been invited to Wisconsin to accept the apology. The
ceremony is planned at the historical marker erected in 1955.
   Chief Elmer Manatowa of the Sac and Fox Nation in Oklahoma said
he was pleased with the apology, but admitted having ``second,
third and fourth thoughts about it.''
   ``Why us? Why not the present day Indian people in Wisconsin
that need the help now?'' he asked, referring to the fact that
members of the Sac and Fox Nation long ago left the state. His
Oklahoma band has 2,220 members.
   ``To have the state of Wisconsin publicly apologize is something
we look at,'' Manatowa said. ``I am going to ask the state of
Wisconsin to do the same thing for the Chippewa, to do something to
ease the relationship up there.''
   Headlines about Indian relations in Wisconsin in recent years
mostly have focused on hostilities over the Chippewa's special
treaty rights to spear fish, hunt and cut timber off reservation in
the northern third of the state.
   Since 1983, when a court affirmed that the Chippewa retained the
rights under 19th century federal treaties ceding their territory,
Chippewa and non-Indians have clashed over the tribe's right to
spear fish in spawning season.
   Last year, 200 protesters were arrested at lakes where Chippewa
were fishing.
   Clarenbach said the state's willingness to apologize to the Sac
and Fox Nation won't solve unrest over Chippewa treaty rights, but
it symbolizes the beginning of a new atmosphere of freedom and
trust.
   According to the Assembly resolution, more than 1,000 Sac and
Fox Indians, following the leadership of Black Hawk, were
attempting to cross the Mississippi River at a point that is now
the southeastern corner of Minnesota and restore their villages in
1832.
   The Army, aided by an armed steamboat, set out to stop them.
   Estimates of how many Indians died range from 850 to 1,400.
   ``The Black Axe Massacre was one of the bloodiest tragedies in
the sad history of American-Indian relations,'' historian Ray Allen
Billington wrote in ``Westward Expansion: A History of the American
Frontier.''
   Manatowa said the apology won't erase his people's pain over the
massacre or other injustices. But he calls it a first step toward
bringing future generations of Indians and non-Indians together.
   ``The people who followed Black Hawk and didn't make it, maybe
this will help put them to rest,'' he said.

<HEAD>``Worst is Over'' as Factory Orders Recover in March</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Orders to factories for manufactured goods
have rebounded from January's worst decline in 16 years, the
government said Wednesday in a report analysts interpreted as
another sign the industrial sector is recovering from months of
weakness.
   The Commerce Department said orders for both durable and
non-durable goods rose 3.8 percent in March, to a seasonally
adjusted $240.4 billion, after advancing 1.8 percent in February
and thus recovered from the 5.5 percent decline in January.
   Robert G. Dederick, chief economist with the Northern Trust Co.
in Chicago, said the weakness ``is behind us and we now have a
flat, slightly upward bias.''
   ``I think the worst is over,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist
for the Boston Co. ``The question now is what kind of rebound and
whether the (long-term) interest spike over the last month or so
will abort what appears to be a recovery.''
   The January drop was the steepest since a 7 percent decline in
December 1974. The March increase was the largest since a 4.7
percent gain in December 1988.
   The department said most of the overall March increase was in
durable goods, up 6.6 percent to $128.7 billion after a 2.4 percent
increase the previous month.
   Durable goods _ big-ticket items expected to last more than
three years _ have borne the brunt of high interest rates since
they often are financed through loans.
   But most of the durable goods increase was concentrated in the
transportation category. It was up 22.4 percent to $36.6 billion
due in large part to a 63.2 percent increase in aircraft orders.
Transportation orders had risen 10.1 percent in February.
   Excluding transportation, orders were up 1 percent.
   Other durable goods categories posting gains were primary
metals, up 7.3 percent to $11.7 billion after a 4.2 percent decline
in February, and non-electrical machinery, up 1.2 percent to $22.6
billion after falling 0.6 percent in February.
   Electrical machinery orders, on the other hand, fell 1.6 percent
to $19.6 billion after rising 2.8 percent the previous month.
   Non-durable goods orders also rose, up 0.8 percent to $111.7
billion on top of a 1.1 percent gain the previous month. Food and
chemicals accounted for most of the advance.
   In the key category of non-defense capital goods, a barometer of
business investment plans, orders advanced 14.4 percent to $41.3
billion after declines of 5.9 percent in February and 13.6 percent
in January.
   But defense orders dropped 3.9 percent to $7.4 billion after
jumping 18.3 percent in February. Excluding defense, orders gained
4 percent, the largest such increase since a similar advance in
April 1989.
   The department also said shipments were up 1.1 percent to $236.8
billion after gaining 3.4 percent a month earlier. They were the
first back-to-back gains since January 1989.
   Inventories fell 0.3 percent to $371.9 billion, their third
decline in four months.
   ``Inventories are in extremely good shape and that points
positively,'' Dederick said.
   Inventories are watched closely because if they increase without
a corresponding gain in new orders, production cutbacks could occur
in the future as factories try to get rid of goods stored on
shelves and backlots.

   Members of NATO, not the Soviet Union,
must decide whether a unified Germany should be part of the Western
alliance, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said today.
   Baker, who stopped here briefly on his way to a NATO meeting in
Brussels, Belgium, on Thursday, said however that he was willing to
consider the Soviet position in talks with Foreign Minister Eduard
A. Schevardnadze later in the week.
   ``The question whether the unified Germany should be a member of
NATO is a question that is properly decided in NATO with the
participation of a united Germany,'' Baker told reporters on the
flight from Washington.
   ``The fact of the matter is you can't take a decision of that
nature without having the members of the alliance sitting at the
table as a party to the decision,'' Baker said.
   Baker said that, at a meeting Saturday of the four wartime
allies and the two Germanys, ``there will be, indeed, a very full
and complete discussion of that issue, because that is one of the
foremost issues right now that separate the alliance from the
position of the Soviet Union.''
   Baker's first stop is Brussels for separate sessions Thursday
with NATO and European Community foreign ministers. This will give
the administration a chance to say how fast it wants moves toward
the political union of Western Europe to proceed and what the
alliance's future role should be.
   Britain, with some support from Denmark and Portugal, is trying
to slow the pace being set by France and West Germany. The United
States has kept its distance from what is essentially a European
decision, but it intends to keep close ties to its old allies.
   Shortly after Baker departed Washington, officials of the two
German states announced tentative agreement on a plan for merging
their economies, settling basic differences over how the nations
should assess the costs of unification.
   Today's agreement, announced by officials in East Berlin, sets
the stage for a full merger of the economies of the two nations on
July 2.
   Ahead for Baker on Friday in Bonn is a round of talks on how the
union of East Germany with West Germany will affect the security of
neighboring European nations, such as the Soviet Union and Poland.
   Baker is intent on promoting membership in the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization for the reunified Germany, but the Soviets are
uneasy about their former ally, East Germany, slipping into the
Western military camp.
   There will be meetings of the Big Four allies that stopped the
Nazis in World War II _ the United States, Britain, France and the
Soviet Union _ and separate talks by Baker with Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   Lithuania's drive for independence, and the Soviet economic
blockade of the breakaway republic, is high on the agenda.
   On Capitol Hill Tuesday, Baker came under pressure from several
senators on the cautious stance President Bush is taking toward
Moscow. Last week he withheld economic sanctions while U.S. and
Soviet negotiators in Paris completed the framework of a new trade
agreement.
   Sens. Alfonse M. D'Amato, R-N.Y., Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., and
others urged the administration not to lower U.S. tariffs for
Soviet goods as long as the Soviets continue the blockade of
Lithuania.
   ``Some of us feel that we are slipping and sliding into `most
favored nation' (trade) status with the Soviet Union, while they
are still taking aggressive, oppressive actions in the Baltic
countries,'' DeConcini said.
   Going beyond Lithuania, the senator also criticized the
administration as being too lenient to China, which suppressed
pro-democracy students in 1989, and to Iraq, which threatened to
use chemical weapons against Israel.
   ``We must not lose our moral compass,'' DeConcini told Baker.
   Similarly, Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg, D-N.J., said, ``We urge you
and expect that you will keep the kinds of pressure on the Soviet
Union that you can, short of totally disrupting a relationship that
has been developing of recent years.''
   Baker said the administration still hoped for a dialogue between
Soviet and Lithuanian leaders over the Baltic republic's drive for
independence.
   He offered assurances that completion of the outline of a new
U.S.-Soviet trade agreement did not mean Bush would recommend to
Congress a one-year waiver of high U.S. tariffs. Lower tariffs
depend also on the Soviets completing legislation to permit free
emigration by its citizens, Baker said.
   He stressed, however, that the U.S.-Soviet relationship ran far
deeper than problems in the Baltics. He cited negotiations for
treaties to sharply reduce Soviet tanks and troops in Europe and
the Soviet arsenal of long-range nuclear missiles.
   Besides, Baker said, ``we want to see a continued approach by
the Soviet Union that will permit us to hopefully bring freedom and
democracy to other areas of the world.''

   A man who allegedly sent threatening letters to
George Harrison was arrested Wednesday, police said.
   The 47-year-old ex-Beatle received the letters at his mansion in
Friar Park near Henley, 35 miles west of central London, where he
lives with his wife and son.
   The Daily Mirror reported that Harrison has been haunted by fear
of an assassin's bullet ever since another former Beatle, John
Lennon, was slain in 1980. Harrison is constantly accompanied by a
bodyguard, the paper said.
   Thames Valley police swooped on a south London address to detain
the man after an examination of the letters' postmarks found they
were all sent from that area, a police spokesman said.
   ``We have traced the person who sent the letters. Papers will be
submitted for consideration for prosecution,'' said a police
spokesman, who was not identified in keeping with British custom.
   The newspaper reported that Harrison had received five anonymous
handwritten letters in recent weeks threatening death.

   Pop star Belinda Carlisle has withdrawn
from appearing at the Cheyenne Frontier Days Rodeo, saying
livestock at such events are mistreated.
   ``Watching people roughly rope terrified calves is not my idea
of entertainment,'' Carlisle said in a statement Tuesday.
   Frontier Days officials denied animals are mistreated. Terry
Bridwell, head of the event's public relations committee, said the
singer's views ``appear to be based on misinformation.''
   Carlisle, a spokeswoman for People for Ethical Treatment of
Animals, said she was offered $35,000 to appear July 23, but turned
it down when she learned events would include a rodeo, chuckwagon
racing and bullfighting. Her statement said rodeos involve the use
of testicular bucking straps, electric prods, sharp sticks, caustic
ointments and other devices.
   None of those items can be used in Professional Rodeo Cowboy
Association-sanctioned rodeos such as Frontier Days, Bridwell said.
   Carlisle has been replaced by Michael Damian of ``The Young and
the Restless.''

   A lawyer for Johnny Carson said the talk-show
host's first wife is hoping negative publicity for her ex-husband
will force him to increase her alimony.
   ``Simply put, this is a baldfaced holdup _ a vehicle to generate
unfavorable publicity in an attempt to extort money,'' Carson's
lawyer, Stanley Arkin, said in court papers filed Tuesday.
   Joan Wolcott ``Jody'' Carson, 62, is asking the court to order
Carson to pay her $120,000 a year. She gets $13,500 yearly.
   ``For him, that's like paying carfare,'' she said.
   The Carsons were married in 1949 and divorced in 1963. In 1970,
Mrs. Carson agreed to the annual amount, which was to be paid even
if she remarried. She remarried the same year as the settlement.
   Her attorney, Raoul Felder, stressed that he is not asking to
nullify the agreement, only to ``adjust her income so that she can
live adequately.''
   Arkin said the first Mrs. Carson's ``flawed and baseless
position'' is that Carson owes her because he happened to prosper
many years after their divorce.
   Carson, 64, and his fourth wife, Alexis Maas, 41, have been
married since 1987.

   Maverick Soviet politician Boris Yeltsin
got up from his hospital bed and walked Wednesday for the first
time since undergoing surgery for a slipped disc two days earlier,
his doctor said.
   The 59-year-old opposition figure recovered ``90 percent of the
movement in his right foot and is recovering satisfactorily from
the operation,'' said Dr. Josep Llovet Tapies of Barcelona Hospital.
   Yeltsin arrived Sunday to appear on a Catalonian regional
television talk show. On Monday, he canceled his activities after
complaining of back pains and was later taken to the hospital for
surgery.
   Llovet Tapies indicated Yeltsin was to remain hospitalized for
two to three days, but full recuperation after his return to Moscow
was expected to extend for a month.
   Yeltsin began to gather mass support in 1987, when he spoke out
for a faster pace of reform. The criticism cost him his post as
Moscow Communist Party chief, but he later won election to the
People's Congress of Deputies.

   Celebrity divorce lawyer Marvin Mitchelson
conceded misconduct in seven allegations involving client
relations, and the state bar's has dismissed more serious charges.
   Mitchelson's agreement with the State Bar of California came
Tuesday, on the eve of a misconduct hearing. No date for a
disciplinary hearing was set. Penalties could range from a warning
to disbarment.
   The flamboyant attorney, who gained fame in 1976 with his
landmark ``palimony'' lawsuit against actor Lee Marvin, accepted
allegations that included failing to adequately supervise the
filing of two appeals and not promptly repaying disputed fees to a
client.
   ``They're not serious charges,'' Mitchelson said. ``There's
nothing involving moral turpitude.''
   The Bar agreed to drop charges that included misappropriation of
funds.
   Mitchelson faces other misconduct charges filed recently that
include allegedly mishandling a client trust account, writing bad
checks and keeping poor records. He will seek to have those charges
dismissed.

   Tiny, exclusive Mills College has never
been where the boys are, but a vote by trustees of the 138-year-old
women's school may admit male undergraduates for the first time.
   The trustees of Northern California's only women's college meet
privately Thursday at an undisclosed location to decide whether to
go coeducational 101 years after graduating the first women west of
the Mississippi.
   Students say they feel powerless to affect the board's decision,
although most of the 777 women undergrads at the quiet, tree-lined
campus in East Oakland oppose the plan designed to boost enrollment
and revenues.
   ``I think the board of trustees is going to vote to go co-ed no
matter what we say. They've shown that so far,'' said Nina
Schneider, a 22-year-old art major who will graduate this year.
   Mills has admitted male graduate students since the 1930s, when
the program began, said Lindsey Beaben, a Mills spokeswoman who
noted that schools can lose federal funds if they exclude graduate
students because of race, sex or national origin. Nearly 20 percent
of the 264 graduate students are men.
   Its undergraduate school is one of three in the state and 98
nationwide that exclude men.
   Although most students and faculty oppose admitting male
undergraduates, administrators say going coeducational ultimately
will save the prestigious liberal arts school from a growing
financial crisis.
   ``Of course it will be an unpopular decision. It will be a
heartbreaking decision,'' said the trustees' chairman F. Warren
Hellman, whose family members have attended Mills and held
positions on its board for 75 years.
   Hellman, a San Francisco investment banker, said the college
must go co-ed to avoid relying too much on its $70 million
endowment, which provides one-fifth of the school's $24 million
annual budget.
   ``We had a deficit last year and we'll have a deficit this year
and the next,'' Hellman said. ``It's not working any longer. I
don't want to see us eat away at the endowment until we're in real
trouble.''
   Opponents argue that admitting men would violate tradition at
the institution that began as the Young Ladies Seminary high school
in Benicia before moving 35 miles southeast to Oakland as a college
in 1871.
   Opponents also contend that letting men into undergraduate
classrooms could spoil the atmosphere that allows women to take
leadership roles in discussions and on campus.
   ``There's a sense of empowerment women get from attending this
college because of the climate in the classroom,'' said Robyn
Fisher, the 21-year-old senior president of the Associated Students
at Mills.
   Enrollment in Mills College's 33 undergraduate programs is down
4.2 percent from three years ago and 29 percent below the 1,000
students needed to balance the budget. Peak undergraduate
enrollment was 810 students in 1987.
   Frank DeToma, dean of the faculty, said he's not sure if
trustees will heed last week's 57-26 faculty vote against admitting
male undergraduates.
   ``Many women do demonstrably better in this teaching
environment,'' said DeToma, who came to Mills in 1989 after 19
years at all-woman Mount Holyoke in Massachusetts. ``But I
personally feel going co-ed will help maintain the liberal arts
programs at the high standards we have now.''
   Sociology professor Ted Thomas headed the panel that proposed
the co-ed idea after rejecting ideas to attract more women students.
   ``Going co-ed is the least risky option for the future of the
college,'' said Thomas, who's been at Mills for 26 years. ``There
are two ways to look at this, in a funereal way or as a challenge
to build upon something that has a great tradition.''
   Even the numbers seem to favor a change. Only 4.2 percent of
California students taking college entrance examinations say they
want to go to an all-female college.
   And the $11,900 tuition, which usually increases 8 percent a
year, is 10 times more expensive than the University of
California's public colleges and universities.

   President F.W. de Klerk and
African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela on Wednesday urged
the swift abolition of apartheid and began historic talks aimed at
ending white-minority rule.
   The three days of meetings are to remove obstacles to full-scale
negotiations on a new constitution that would give the 28-million
black majority a voice in national affairs for the first time.
   De Klerk and Mandela, standing on the lawn of a Dutch colonial
mansion where the talks were held, said South Africans of all races
want swift change. All political parties must work toward a
peaceful solution to racial and political divisions, they said.
   Nearby, the pro-apartheid Conservative Party walked out of a
debate in Parliament to protest the talks. The Conservative leader,
Andries Treurnicht, said the government should not negotiate with
an organization that has carried out guerrilla attacks and still
was committed to armed struggle.
   ``South African law forbids all these actions,'' said
Treurnicht, whose party is the main opposition in Parliament's
white chamber. The tri-cameral Parliament also has chambers for
people of mixed-race and Indian descent. Blacks are excluded.
   Mandela, in a statement before the talks began, said: ``The pace
at which we move to arrive at a just solution should be informed by
the fact that the black masses of our country demand and expect
fundamental change now, and not tomorrow.''
   ``The people as a whole want the peace and stability that can
only come about as a result of the total abolition of the apartheid
system,'' he said.
   But de Klerk warned that violence that has claimed more than 500
lives in the past three months threatens such change. Much of the
violence has been among black groups with differing views of a
future South Africa.
   ``The vast majority of South Africans desire the negotiation
process, aimed at a new constitution, to get started in all
earnestness,'' de Klerk said. ``The government wishes this to
happen as soon as possible and is consequently approaching the
talks with the utmost earnestness.''
   The ANC demands the release of all political prisoners, lifting
of the state of emergency and the return of exiled activists as
preconditions to constitutional negotiations.
   The government, meanwhile, is demanding the ANC, a guerrilla
movement, renounce its largely dormant armed struggle.
   The talks are the first between a white government and an ANC
delegation since the organization was founded in 1912. The
discussions are being held at the Groote Schuur estate, once the
official home of South African presidents.
   Security for the meeting was strict. Scores of uniformed police
and plainclothes security agents guarded the house and grounds.
   The two sides said they plan to make no further comment on the
talks until they adjourn Friday.
   In his statement before the talks began, Mandela attempted to
calm white fears about a black government, saying whites would
enjoy full rights in a non-racial democratic state.
   He made part of his remarks in Afrikaans, the language of the
Dutch-descended Afrikaners. They comprise 3 million of the
country's 5 million whites and dominate the government.
   Mandela, the ANC's deputy president, was released in February
after 27 years in jail for helping to launch the ANC's armed
struggle. He is the de facto leader of the group, whose president,
Oliver Tambo, last year suffered a stroke.
   Mandela called the talks a historic turning point marking the
end of a ``servant and master'' relationship between blacks and
whites.
   South Africa, he said, would never again base its political and
social systems on racial superiority and segregation.
   ``The idea that the color of a person defines their place in
society must, to all of us, be as frightening as the plague,'' he
said.
   Mandela also stressed the need to improve the economic
conditions of millions of blacks who live in desperate poverty
while whites control most wealth.
   The two sides are expected to make progress this week, but
government and ANC officials say further preliminary talks may be
necessary to remove all obstacles to constitutional negotiations.
   De Klerk has promised to end white rule, but he opposes a simple
one-person, one-vote system. He says such a system would replace
white domination with black domination.
   The ANC says it is committed to a fully democratic system with
no special rights for any minority. The ANC also wants a radical
restructuring of the economy that could include nationalizing
banks, gold mines and other leading industries.
   Both sides are under pressure from black and white extremists
who oppose any settlement. Pro-apartheid whites want to preserve
white rule while radical black groups want to end all forms of
white control and privilege.

<HEAD>Study Boosts Evidence That AIDS Virus Gene Promotes AIDS-Related
Cancer</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For release at 6 p.m. EDT, time set by source</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists have found new evidence that a single
gene of the AIDS virus promotes an AIDS-related cancer called
Kaposi's sarcoma.
   The gene tells cells to produce a particular protein, and the
new test-tube study found that this protein spurred the growth of
Kaposi's sarcoma cells taken from AIDS patients.
   Scientists also found that the protein was released by cells
infected with the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency
syndrome.
   Kaposi's sarcoma is a generally uncommon cancer that appears
unusually often in people with AIDS. It can be controlled medically
and it rarely kills AIDS patients.
   The study focused on a gene called tat, which helps regulate
growth of the AIDS virus. In previous research, scientists had
found that when mice were given a copy of this gene, they developed
a skin disease that closely resembled Kaposi's sarcoma.
   Combined with that finding, the new work indicates that once the
gene's protein escapes from an AIDS-infected cell, it may promote
the development or progression of Kaposi's sarcoma elsewhere in the
body, researchers wrote in Thursday's issue of the British journal
Nature.
   The work was reported by Dr. Robert Gallo and colleagues at the
National Cancer Institute and Dr. Flossie Wong-Staal of the
University of California, San Diego.

<HEAD>Shamir Says Peace Effort Should Be Expanded to Arab States</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICOLAS B. TATRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir is emphasizing
the need for broader-based negotiations with the Arab world in
place of the Palestinian-Israeli dialogue promoted by U.S.
officials.
   Shamir, who appears likely to head Israel's next government, has
played down the importance of holding talks with Palestinians in
Cairo as proposed by U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   ``One should not expect us in Israel to always agree with
everything the Americans offer us, just as the Americans would not
always agree with our proposals,'' Shamir told reporters Wednesday.
   Instead, he and others in his caretaker government have
emphasized that the focus of peacemaking efforts should be shifted
toward Arab states such as Iraq, Syria and Libya, which pose a
greater threat to Israel than the 28-month-old Palestinian uprising.
   The shift in emphasis appears to have been provoked by Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein, who last month warned he would destroy
half of Israel with binary chemical weapons in response to any
Israeli attack.
   ``I think that something is perhaps understood today that was
not understood before Saddam Hussein spoke, that the Palestinian
part of the Arab-Israeli conflict is only one of the parts and not
the most important one, compared to the other parts,'' Foreign
Minister Moshe Arens said on Israel TV this week.
   In recent months, violence has tapered off in the occupied
lands, whereas concern about chemical warfare was brought home to
every Israeli by the army's plan _ provoked by Saddam's remarks _
to distribute gas masks nationwide.
   In an interview Wednesday, Brig. Gen. Nachman Shai, the army
spokesman, said the danger posed by Arab states outweighs that of
riots in the occupied lands.
   ``People understand now ... that the argument is not now on the
West Bank. It has gone back to square one. What is the overall
solution? You cannot settle the Nablus riots and be happy,
(neither) us (nor) them,'' he said.
   He said Israel's main concern now is radical Arab regimes.
   ``What do Iraq and Syria intend to do? To look for the right
moment to start a war,'' he said.
   But Moshe Maoz, a Hebrew University Middle East expert, argued
that Israel should start peace negotiations with the Palestinians
now if it does not want the Arab world to unite against Israel.
   Noting the Egyptian-Syrian summit in Damascus and signs of a
Syrian-Iraqi rapprochement, Maoz said that for Israel to be
stubborn ``would reach an opposite goal and strengthen unity in the
Arab world.''
   Sources say Shamir also was put off the Baker plan because he
felt the United States encouraged his Labor Party rival, Shimon
Peres, to provoke the current political crisis.
   Peres brought down a Shamir-led coalition March 15 after Shamir
refused to endorse Baker's proposals. But he failed to put together
a government, opening the door for Shamir.
   Officials of Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc say Shamir will not
formulate a specific policy until he has assembled a ruling
coalition, and his hard line could be modified if the center-left
Labor Party is included.
   Shamir has been grumbling for some time that U.S. proposals
focus only on his offer of Palestinian elections and ignore other
aspects of his five-point plan, which the government approved May
14, 1989.
   The plan called for an end to the state of war with Arab states,
aid to resettle Palestinians living in crowded refugee camps, peace
with Jordan and a ``statement of principles'' opposing talks with
the Palestine Liberation Organization or creation of a Palestinian
state.
   ``We have voted in the Cabinet on the five points ... and I see
these five points, together with our assumptions, as one unity,''
he told reporters.
   But the Arab world is unlikely to accept broader negotiations
except in the context of a U.N.-sponsored international conference.
Shamir has rejected that idea because he feels the conference would
be biased against Israel.
   Shamir's refusal to accept the Baker approach is seen by many
Palestinians here and by Arab leaders abroad as foot-dragging.
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said after a May Day speech
that Shamir does not appear to seek peace.
   Responding Wednesday, Shamir said: ``Peace is not something you
say today and it will happen tomorrow. It is a long process.''

   Elizabeth Taylor has improved
considerably but doctors wouldn't speculate on how much longer the
actress will be hospitalized while she recovers from pneumonia, her
publicist said Wednesday.
   ``She's doing fine. She has improved significantly,'' said her
New York City spokeswoman, Chen Sam. ``We don't know how much

   Twenty-four days earlier, Miss Taylor entered Daniel Freeman
Marina Hospital with a sinus infection. But her condition worsened
and she was moved to the intensive care unit at St. John's Hospital

   During a news conference at the hospital last week, doctors said
the 58-year-old Oscar-winning star of ``Who's Afraid of Virginia
Woolf?'' and ``Butterfield 8'' was near death at one point.

<HEAD>Stars Call for TV Sets Required to Display Closed-Captioning</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actors from the ``L.A. Law,'' ``Cosby'' and
``Sesame Street'' TV programs gave their support Wednesday to a
bill that would require all standard-sized television sets to be
able to display captions for deaf or hearing-impaired viewers.
   Witnesses at a House hearing, including TV stars Richard Dysart,
Geoffrey Owens and Linda Bove, said millions of Americans are being
excluded from access to broad-based communications systems,
particularly TV.
   Transmitting so-called closed captioning services on most TV
sets would benefit not only the estimated 24 million Americans with
hearing disabilities, but some 18 million youngsters learning to
read and millions more foreigners and illiterate adults trying to
learn English.
   ``I think captioning should be a standard feature on the
television signal _ that's how important it is,'' said Owens, a
co-star on NBC-TV's ``Cosby Show.''
   A TV manufacturers' representative, however, said it would be
unfair to require that everyone, particularly the poor or
low-income senior citizens, be required to bear the costs of sets
with closed-captioning capability.
   The bill by Rep. Major Owens, D-N.Y, and a companion measure by
Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, would require all sets with screens 13
inches or larger be able to display captions. Cost of such
circuitry has been estimated at $15 to $20.
   Making such circuitry mandatory ``amounts to a regressive excise
tax on all purchasers of television sets in order to benefit a
small, albeit deserving, minority,'' said Thomas P. Friel, a vice
president with the Electronic Industries Association.
   He urged the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on
telecommunications and finance to require that only some TV sets be
capable of closed-captioning.
   Beginning with the 1989 season, ABC, CBS and NBC were offering
closed-captioning on all their primetime programs, noted
subcommittee Chairman Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass. But witnesses
said most local and syndicated programs are not closed-captioned,
and that only 90 of some 1,500 local news broadcasts are
closed-captioned.
   ``It's a cost decision,'' said I. King Jordan, president of the
Gallaudet University school for the hearing impaired. He said he
feared the major television networks would stop offering
closed-captioning unless a way was found to enlarge the audience
for such services.
   He said the government already has spent $45 million on
closed-captioning since the late 1970s and the closed-captioning
bill ``would ensure that this money will not have been wasted.''
   Dysart, who is co-star of NBC-TV's ``L.A. Law'' and 1990
chairman of the Council for Better Hearing and Speech Month,
dismissed the economic arguments. He said the prices for the
closed-captioning circuitry would drop dramatically when all sets
had the closed-captioning circuitry.
   Dysart said most people cannot afford to buy set-top devices
that currently provide closed-captioning. Only about 300,000 of the
set-top decoders are in use, primarily because of the $160 to $200
per-unit cost, he said.
   Bove of the ``Sesame Street'' children's show, said captioning
was very important in helping children with normal hearing learn to
read. She said it cost between $1,500 and $2,000 to caption a
30-minute TV program.

<HEAD>Landsbergis Agrees to Consider Suspending Some Laws</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lithuania's president said Wednesday his Baltic
republic would consider suspending temporarily some of the
pro-independence laws that drove the Kremlin to impose an economic
embargo two weeks ago.
   President Vytautas Landsbergis agreed to the step in a letter to
French and West German leaders who last week proposed that such a
compromise would help start negotiations between the republic and
Moscow.
   ``Everything is negotiable which does not question the matter of
restored independence of the Lithuanian state on March 11, 1990,''
Landsbergis said in his letter to French President Francois
Mitterrand and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   The letter was read to Lithuania's parliament, the Supreme
Council, which gave its approval without a vote, said Aidas
Palubinskas, a spokesman for the parliament.
   ``Putting our confidence in France and the Federal Republic of
Germany, as well as in other Western democracies, and in their
support of Lithuanian democracy, we are asking you to transmit to
the Soviet authorities our consent to consider a temporary
suspension of the effects of the decisions taken by the sovereign
parliament of the Lithuanian Republic that could trouble the Soviet
authorities,'' Landsbergis wrote.
   The idea behind the proposal from France and West Germany was
that if Lithuania temporarily suspended those laws, the Soviet
Union, in return, might ease its pressure on the republic and also
agree to talks on secession.
   Palubinskas stressed that the proposal from Kohl and Mitterrand
did not ask for rescinding the declaration itself, but urged the
suspension of laws passed to implement the independence declaration.
   Lithuania declared independence on March 11, trying to restore
the freedom it enjoyed before 1940, when the Soviet Union forcibly
annexed it along with Latvia and Estonia. It has since passed laws
designed to back the independence drive, including ending
conscription of Lithuanians into the Soviet army, issuing identity
cards for non-Lithuanians and seizing Communist Party property.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has declared the
independence declaration invalid and rejected negotiations with the
republic, saying such talks are reserved for foreign countries. He
demanded that Lithuania rescind those pro-independence laws.
   Gorbachev imposed a partial economic blockade, cutting supplies
of fuel and other commodities to Lithuania. As of Wednesday night,
no resumption of any of the fuel supplies has been reported.
   The republic of 3.8 million people has been struggling
economically ever since the embargo was imposed.
   At least 10,000 people have been thrown out of work due to
factory closures, Palubinskas said, with that number expected to
increase to 35,000 by the end of the week. Rationing of gasoline
and food has begun, and medicine is in short supply in some
hospitals.
   Soviet officials have welcomed the French-German proposal,
contained in a letter to Landsbergis and Gorbachev. Gorbachev's
spokesman, Arkady Maslennikov, told a briefing in Moscow on
Saturday that the letter ``is not far from the line that the Soviet
leadership has been pursuing.''
   The republic's prime minister, Kazimiera Prunskiene, is
scheduled to meet Thursday with President Bush in Washington. Bush
has urged the Lithuanians and Soviets to negotiate their dispute
but has refused to impose sanctions on the Kremlin or recognize the
republic's independence.
   ``We hope that Mrs. Prunskiene will more completely inform
President Bush about the situation in Lithuania in the days of
blockade,'' Landsbergis told parliament Wednesday, according to
Eduardas Potashinskas of Lithuanian television.
   In another development, the independent news service Postfactum
in Moscow reported Lithuania is trying to revive oil wells to help
make up for the April 18 cutoff of oil supplies by the Kremlin.
   Interfax, a news service affiliated with Moscow Radio, said the
wells would be able to produce only enough oil for agricultural
needs.
   Lithuanians are rebuilding facilities at the port of Klaipeda to
allow it to receive imported oil later this month, Interfax said.
It did not say who would supply the oil, which would have to be
bought with foreign currency that Lithuania lacks.
   Wednesday was the first workday in Lithuania under the food
rationing system. Most stores were closed Tuesday, when the system
went into effect, because of the May Day holiday.
   Daina Kalendra, a worker at the Supreme Council's information
office, said that for May and June, each person is limited to the
following: sugar, 4.4 pounds; macaroni, 2.2 pounds; grains, 4.4
pounds; salt, 2.2 pounds; flour, 4.4 pounds; grease or margarine,
about a half-pound.
   Lithuania supplies most of its own meat and dairy needs.
   The crisis threatened to expand to Latvia on Thursday, when that
republic's parliament will convene to consider declaring its
independence.
   Unlike Lithuania, where native Lithuanians make up 80 percent of
the population, native residents make up about 54 percent of
Latvia's 2.7 million residents, with the rest largely Russians who
frown on the idea of secession.
   Despite their ethnic disadvantage, Latvian nationalists have
been pushing for the parliament to emulate Lithuania.

   A gunman ambushed and killed a bicycle
rider, seriously injured a driver and wounded two police officers
before he was shot in a sidewalk gunbattle outside a crowded
shopping mall, police said.
   Paul Bellazain was wounded in the thigh Tuesday during a
shootout with officers near the Westlake Mall in Daly City, just
south of San Francisco, said Daly City police Detective Jim McHenry.
   One of the officers tackled Bellazain, who carried a pistol, as
he tried to flee, ending a 45-minute rampage in which a gunman in a
brown Cadillac cruised a freeway and side streets in San Francisco,
fatally shooting the bicyclist and firing at cars.
   Daly City police said Bellazain would be booked for
investigation of two counts of attempted murder. San Francisco
police said Bellazain was under investigation in connection with
the shootings here. Bellazain, 46, was in fair condition Tuesday
night at Kaiser Hospital.
   Bellazain, a veteran San Francisco transit driver, has been off
work the past five months, receiving workers' compensation because
of a hand injury.
   The shooting spree apparently began in San Francisco shortly
before 9 a.m., when officers received reports of shots fired on
Alemany Boulevard, said police spokesman Dave Ambrose.
   A short time later, James Newman was struck by a bullet that
entered his arm and lodged in his chest as he was driving on I-280
in San Francisco. Newman, 41, was in serious condition Tuesday
night at San Francisco General Hospital.
   At 9:10 a.m., police received a call that a bike rider was shot
to death at McLaren Park near the Daly City border. He was
identified by the coroner's office today as James Vaszko, 43, a
copy editor at the San Francisco Examiner.
   ``Everyone here was just shocked,'' said Larry Kramer, executive
editor of the Examiner. ``He was just one of those really nice,
intellectual type of guys. He was a sweetheart.''
   The gunman apparently continued south into Daly City, where
between 9:10 a.m. and 9:35 a.m., chiropractor Gene Martin and his
receptionist, Stephanie Ryan, were taken hostage in their office.
   ``(He) said `Get over there, doc,' and then he started to rant
and rave how the system was messing him up,'' a shaken Martin said.
   ``He had three guns when he came in and he said he was sorry he
didn't have an Uzi,'' Martin said. ``I thought I was going to die,
but he was really after the cops.''
   Bellazain gave Martin tapes containing what he said were
messages to his children proclaiming his love for them. He told the
hostages he wanted to get back at police because they were
reportedly investigating him for alleged child abuse.
   San Francisco and Daly City police said they knew of no such
investigation, but Bellazain had been under a restraining order
sought by his ex-wife, Shirley Ann Bellazain, who said he abused
her and their children during their 17-year marriage.
   The gunman let the receptionist go after she lied, saying she
was pregnant, according to Martin. He said Bellazain told him to
call police before storming out of the office to confront officers
with a volley of shots.
   ``It seemed like the shooting went on forever,'' said Alfredo
Aguirre, manager of the San Mateo County Mental Health Clinic near
the shopping center, where horrified shoppers witnessed the
gunbattle.
   Two officers, Sgt. Ralph Warren and Gary Smith, were each shot
in the arm during the gunbattle. Police said it was not clear who
shot Bellazain.

<HEAD>East and West Germany Agree on Economic Merger Plan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two German states agreed on a treaty for
merging their economies Wednesday after West Germany agreed to give
elderly East Germans more financial protection from the throes of
the free market.
   The tentative agreement, which still has to be approved by the
parliaments of both countries, settles major differences between
the two Germanys over how to assess the high costs of unification.
   It clears the way for a full merger of their economies by July
2, when the West German mark will become the official currency of
East Germany.
   In a major compromise, West Germany said it would allow senior
citizens in East Germany to convert more of their savings at a
favorable 1-1 rate to the West German mark.
   The plan comes just three days before a meeting between the two
Germanys and the four World War II allies that divided Germany _
the Soviet Union, United States, Britain, and France _ to discuss
the international ramifications of German unity.
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III was to join foreign
ministers from the other countries for the historic
``four-plus-two'' talks in Bonn, the West German capital.
   A full political merger of the two Germanys is expected next
year. But first some thorny issues must be resolved, including
membership of a unified Germany in NATO and new European security
arrangements.
   The economic merger agreement was confirmed Wednesday by Mathias
Gehler, spokesman for East German Prime Minister Lothar de
Maiziere, and Rudolf Seiters, chief of staff for West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   ``I want to emphasize that what (the Germanys) have agreed upon
is tied with the responsibility of the economic and social
developments in both parts of Germany and the stability of the
(West German) mark,'' Seiters said in a statement in Bonn.
   The two Germanys have been negotiating for weeks over how West
Germany can absorb the crippled East German economy without
threatening the strength of the powerful West German mark.
   The East German mark is officially valued at 3-1 against the
West German mark, but is virtually worthless outside the country.
However, East German officials said they needed a near-equal
conversion rate to make up for removing subsidies which kept down
prices under the former socialist system.
   Under the agreement, all salaries earned by East Germans would
be converted at a 1-1 rate. The agreement also will allow East
Germans to obtain ownernship shares in state-owned enterprises.
   The plan also provides that people aged 60 and older will be
able to convert up to $3,350 in personal savings at the 1-1 rate,
while East Germans 14 and under would be able to convert only up to
$1,180 dollars.
   Everyone else would be able to convert $2,300 at the 1-1 rate.
Any savings above the ceiling levels would be changed at a 2-1 rate.
   West Germany originally had proposed a $2,300 ceiling for all
Germans, but East Germany demanded a higher limit.
   The Bundesbank, West Germany's central bank, had advocated a 2-1
conversion rate, warning that a 1-1 rate would cost the West German
economy billions of dollars.
   Pensioners will receive the most protection under the plan.
Elderly East Germans will have their monthly pensions raised to
West German levels when the economies are merged.
   West Germany also has agreed to allow some still-undefined
financial protection for students and renters who may not be able
to afford rents once they are set by the free market.
   Several protests have been held in recent weeks by East Germans
demanding protection from unemployment and competition from Western
businesses.
   East Germans, who still will earn only about one-third of their
West German counterparts, also fear rising prices when the nations
are united.
   West Germans, meanwhile, fear that absorbing the East German
economy will dilute the power of the mighty West German currency
and lead to higher taxes and inflation.

<HEAD>Captain Says $2 Million Vessel Caught in U.S.-Mexican Dispute</HEAD>

   A yacht captain says his vessel was
seized by Mexican agents and his crew members were beaten and
jailed in retaliation for the alleged U.S. kidnapping of a Mexican
physician accused of murder.
   Both crew members remain in a Mexican jail, he said.
   Robert Ambrosius, captain of the Rusalka, said Tuesday he and
his wife managed to escape April 24 in a pre-dawn dash through
Cuban water. ``I was scared to death,'' he said.
   Ambrosius and the boat's owner, California developer Igor
Olenicoff, theorized that Mexican authorities were seeking revenge
for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's capture last month
of a Guadalajara gynecologist. Dr. Humberto Alvarez was indicted by
a grand jury in Los Angeles in the 1985 torture-slaying of Enrique
Camarena, a DEA agent.
   ``This is just retaliation'' for the Alvarez arrest, said
Olenicoff, who was not on board when the yacht was seized. He said
the Mexican agents told his captain: ``You have one of ours. Now we
have yours.''
   On Wednesday, DEA chief Terrence M. Burke denied that his agents
played a role in the abduction of Alvarez. ``We did not have any
agent actively participate in the planning and execution'' of the
operation, Burke told a Senate hearing in Washington, D.C.
   State Department spokeswoman Frances Jones said the Mexican
government insists it seized the $2 million, 83-foot yacht because
it was carrying illegal guns and had two crew members who did not
have visas.
   Jorge Reyes, a spokesman for the Mexican Embassy in Washington,
said he could not comment because his office knows nothing about
the incident.
   Ambrosius and his wife, Tammy, gave this account of the seizure:
   He was hired as captain of the yacht in February, when the
vessel was in Panama, midway through a cruise from California to
Fort Lauderdale.
   On April 20, the ship landed in Cozumel and notified Mexican
customs, he said.
   Two crew members, Polo Herrera of Panama and Eddie Tovar of
Colombia, had problems because they did not have visas, but Mexican
officials said the problem could be cleared up easily, according to
Ambrosius.
   The next day, about 15 men who said they were Mexican drug
agents but had no identification or uniforms boarded the ship and
found guns used for skeet shooting. Ambrosius said he should have
declared the guns.
   On April 22, he said, the ship was searched for drugs and
contraband by the Mexican navy.
   On April 23, the self-described drug agents returned. Ambrosius
said he heard them beat one of his crew members.
   The agents told him his ship had been seized and they arrested
Herrera and Tovar, who he said are still in jail. The boat remained
anchored off the coast that day and night, watched by patrol boats,
Ambrosius said.
   Early the next day, the patrol boats returned to port and
Ambrosius and his wife weighed anchor and drifted away for a
half-hour before starting the engine.
   He said 15-foot seas kept the patrol boats from following.
   Later, off the coast of Cuba, he noticed boats on radar that
were mirroring his every move. The boats ``were closing in out
there in the middle of nowhere,'' he said.
   Ambrosius said he made a sharp turn between two boats and
briefly moved into Cuban waters. He then made it safely to Key West.
   Coast Guard officials in Key West said they believed Ambrosius'
story but did not see any Mexican patrol boats.

<HEAD>Hungary's New Parliament Breaks With the Past</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TEDDIE WEYR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament made a firm departure from
its Communist past Wednesday, choosing as Hungary's interim
president a writer jailed for his role in the 1956 anti-Soviet
revolt.
   Arpad Goencz, 68, replaced Matyas Szueroes, a member of the
Socialist Party, formerly the Communist Party, which ruled for 42
years. He received 339 of the 370 valid votes cast by secret ballot.
   Goencz's nomination was the result of a pact between the two
largest rivals _ the center-right Hungarian Democratic Forum, which
will most likely form the new government, and the liberal League of
Free Democrats.
   His first deputy, Gyoergy Szabad, 66, a founding member of the
Democratic Forum, became acting speaker of the new freely elected
Parliament. Goencz is officially speaker but will act as head of
state until a new president is elected.
   Goencz, a trained lawyer who entered politics after World War II
as a member of the then-dominant Smallholders' Party, has headed
the Hungarian Writers' Union since last December.
   He spent six years in prison on a life sentence for his role in
the 1956 revolt before winning a reprieve in a 1963 general amnesty.
   During Wednesday's session, historic figures from the last
freely elected Parliament _ before the Communists took power _ were
called to the podium. The session also declared the 1956 uprising a
revolution and a battle for freedom.
   The Democratic Forum and the Free Democrats agreed that the
permanent president should be elected by Parliament rather than in
a direct popular vote. Goencz appeared likely to get that post,
which in Hungary is largely ceremonial.
   Forum leader Jozsef Antall said the presidential election could
happen by early June if the necessary constitutional amendments are
passed and the government is formed.
   He said he expects the new government to be formed by mid-May.
   The Forum is the largest party with 164 seats. The Smallholders
and Christian Democrats have 44 and 21 respectively.
   The government of Socialist Miklos Nemeth formally submitted its
resignation Wednesday, but will continue as a caretaker government
until the new cabinet is formed.
   In a speech, Nemeth noted Hungary's gradual transition to
democracy, which, unlike that of other East bloc countries, was led
by the ruling party.
   ``Many (think) we committed political suicide and (in return)
for dismantling the party-state we were pushed from power,'' Nemeth
said, referring to his Socialist Party's poor showing at the polls.
   The Socialists won only 33 seats in the new parliament.
   Goencz was expected to ask Antall to form a new government when
Parliament resumes on Thursday.
   Wednesday's session was 10 deputies short of a full house. Eight
seats set aside for minority representatives have yet to be filled.
   Exactly one year ago, Hungary began dismantling its borders,
sparking an exodus of East German refugees to the West. That exodus
precipitated the fall of communism in East Germany and later, the
rest of the East bloc.
   ``We must be proud that our country was the pioneer in all the
changes of Eastern Europe,'' Szueroes said in a farewell address.
``Dictatorships have been removed, walls have fallen and become
pieces in museums.''
   Among those who listened as a guest was Otto von Habsburg, the
former crown prince of Hungary and a member of the European
Parliament.
   The house also formally declared it would join the European
Parliament.
   In another symbolic gesture of Hungary's return to democracy,
the old Communist coat of arms that had adorned the ornate
parliament chamber was removed.

   A team of psychologists and social workers
Wednesday counseled and consoled classmates of a senior who
committed suicide by driving his motorcycle into the side of his
high school.
   Dolores Bohen, spokeswoman for the Fairfax County public
schools, said a counseling crisis team also was sent to Edison High
School in Franconia, where Jerry Minnick was a student last year.
   ``We are trying to keep as much structure in the routine as
possible,'' Ms. Bohen said. ``At the same time, we are providing
everyone an opportunity to break away from the routine and sit in
on counseling sessions.''
   While classes were in session Tuesday at Hayfield High, Minnick
took his motorcycle on the school running track, removed his helmet
and raced full-speed into the outside wall of the boys' locker
room. He died instantly.
   County police spokesman Michael Proffitt would not estimate how
fast the 18-year-old Minnick's motorcycle was traveling when it
slammed into the brick wall.
   In Sheridan, Ark., officials put counselors on 24-hour call, as
grieving teen-agers tried to cope with the apparent suicides of
three classmates in two days, including one who killed himself in
class after declaring his love for a girl.
   Ms. Bohen said Minnick's suicide was the first on school grounds
in the 130,000-student school system.
   ``Because he was killed instantly, police had to conduct the
investigation there on the spot before the body was removed. The
school remained the focal point, which was tough,'' she said.
   Proffitt said Minnick was ``distraught over personal problems,''
but he refused to elaborate or say whether Minnick left a note. He
did not know when tests would deterine whether Minnick died under
the influence of alcohol or drugs.
   Natasha Reid, 17, a Hayfield senior, said Minnick had been in a
car accident in front of the school about a month ago and a
motorcycle accident earlier in the year. She said he had not
attended classes much lately.
   Arthur Sullivan, whose son Chris was a friend of Minnick, said
Minnick apparently gave no outward sign Monday night that he was
about to take his life.
   ``All his friends were talking to him, and he was fine,''
Sullivan said. ``It's difficult to know what personal problem might
have been ticking over.''
   School officials said Minnick's parents are dead, and for the
past year he lived in the foster home of Air Force Lt. Col. Edward
Seward, who declined to comment.

<TEXT>
   A former FBI agent said Wednesday the
reputation he established during the investigation that ousted Gov.
Ray Blanton was one reason he defeated Nashville's indicted
incumbent sheriff.
   Hank Hillin received three votes to every one for incumbent
Sheriff Fate Thomas, who faces a 38-count indictment alleging he
used his office to funnel $500,000 in goods and services to himself.
   The sheriff's race was one of four Tuesday in which incumbents
and appointed officials were ousted by newcomers.
   ``I think it was just a feeling that the community was fed up
with machine politics,'' Hillin said.
   Circuit Judge Harry Lester, who was defeated by lawyer Marietta
Shipley, said it seemed voters were picking on anyone in office.
   ``It was just `throw 'em out' and they did it in a big way,''
Lester said.
   Thomas, in office for 18 years, said Tuesday night after
conceding defeat: ``I'm sorry we didn't win _ maybe I didn't work
hard enough.''
   Thomas was known for a political organization that was effective
in getting out the vote and for his grass-roots barbecues, voter
mailing lists and ability to raise funds for himself and other
candidates.
   Hillin led the investigation into the so-called ``clemency for
cash'' scandal of the late 1970s. Although Blanton, who was
governor from 1975 to 1979, was never convicted on charges that
state prison inmates could buy their freedom, two of his aides were
sent to prison.
   Hillin also aided the later investigation that resulted in
Blanton spending two years in federal prison for a 1981 conviction
on mail fraud, extortion and conspiracy charges resulting from a
scheme to sell liquor licenses. The Internal Revenue Service led
that investigation, Hillin said.
   Blanton's mail fraud conviction was thrown out on a legal
technicalityafter he was released from prison. He has appealed the
other convictions.
   ``I had a background of spending five years investigating the
Blanton administration. Political corruption is so difficult to
ferret out, a long and hard paper trail to follow. I think that did
establish me,'' Hillin said.
   The office of Metro Davidson County sheriff in the consolidated
county-city government is not an investigative law enforcement
post. The sheriff's major role is running the county jail and
workhouse. The Metro Nashville Police Department handles law
enforcement and investigative functions.
   Unofficial Democratic primary vote totals showed Hillin winning
with a count of 64,023 votes, or 71 percent, to Thomas' 22,304, or
25 percent.
   Hillin now faces Davidson County Republican Party Chairman Doug
Reynolds and two independent candidates in the Aug. 2 election.
   Thomas faces trial this summer on a federal indictment charging
him and six other department employees with a violations ranging
from racketeering and mail fraud to obstruction of justice and tax
fraud.

<HEAD>Hills Predicts `Dimished Prosperity' with Trade Talks Fail</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills tried
Wednesday to impart a sense of urgency to stalled trade talks by
predicting ``gravely diminished prosperity for all'' if
negotiations fail.
   Hills' warning came at the start of three days of negotiations
with trade ministers from Japan, the 12-nation European Community
and Canada.
   The officials gathered at a resort north of here to search for
ways to break an impasse in a four-year effort to overhaul the
rules governing the world trading system.
   The talks, involving almost 100 nations, are designed to lower a
variety of barriers to trade in agriculture, textiles and other
manufactured goods, and services such as banking and investment.
   The positions of opposing parties have become so entrenched that
many fear failure for the talks being held under the auspices of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   Such an outcome would deal a blow to the administration's hopes
for expanding export opportunities for U.S. farmers and businesses
as a way of whittling down America's huge trade deficit, which has
topped $100 billion for six years.
   Hills, speaking to a group of business writers before the talks
opened, called the negotiations ``the last, best chance this
century to create the trading rules we so sorely need for the next
century.''
   Calling 1990 a ``pivotal year for the world economy,'' Hills
painted failure of the talks in stark terms of diminished living
standards for both industrial and developing countries.
   ``Down one path lie open markets, expanded trade, economic
growth and prosperity. Down the other lie closed markets, nations
turned inward and gravely diminished prosperity for all.''
   Hills said she hoped the discussions, being held in a wine
country resort in Napa, would provide enough guidance so that
lower-level negotiators will be able to reach preliminary agreement
in at least some of the 15 broad areas under discussion at a July
23 session in Geneva, Switzerland.
   It is expected the talks will be high on the agenda when
President Bush is host for the seven-nation economic summit this
summer in Houston.
   A chief aim of the United States is an elimination of all
trade-distorting agricultural subsidies. Hills estimated that
ending the costly subsidies could boost U.S. farm exports by $11
billion annually _ equal to an extra $3,400 for every American
farmer.
   However, the European Community is fighting efforts to reform
the subsidy program that is politically popular with European farm
groups.
   The United States has encountered resistance among Third World
countries to its demands for strengthened rules to prevent patent
and copyright piracy, which costs U.S. businesses an estimated $60
billion annually.
   Third World nations, led by India, are fighting a U.S. proposal
to expand the GATT market-opening rules to cover trade in services,
such as banking, investment and insurance.
   U.S. companies excel in the service field, where 90 percent of
new American jobs are being created. Developing countries fear
their infant service businesses would be no match for huge
multinational companies.
   Developing nations are pushing for the GATT talks to scrap trade
barriers for textile products. But the United States, bowing to
pressure from American textile groups, wants a less comprehensive
phase-down of existing textile tariffs and quotas.
   The current GATT trade talks, launched in Uruguay in 1986, are
scheduled to conclude in Brussels on Dec. 3-7.
   Hills told members of the Society of American Business Editors
and Writers that she hoped the obstacles will be resolved by
December and that a comprehensive agreement can be presented to
Congress next year.
   ``I am an optimist. I couldn't hold this job unless I was,'' she
said.

<TEXT>
   A hospital has agreed to a $41 million
malpractice settlement to the parents of a boy who suffered severe
brain damage after his temperature soared to 108 degrees.
   Freddy and Katie Williams, of Springtown, made the agreement
Tuesday with the former Fort Worth Children's Hospital, now
Cook-Fort Worth Children's Medical Center, in return for the
hospital's promise to drop all appeals.
   Travis Williams, now 14, suffered permanent and severe brain
damage seven years ago while recovering from a 1983 operation. A
jury found hospital nurses had allowed the child's fever to rise to
108 degrees without adequately informing his doctors of the gravity
of his condition.
   Travis's brain injuries have stripped him of his ability to move
or talk.
   The child's neurological pediatrician and neurosurgeon were
exonerated by the jury.
   The hospital's insurance company will cover the cost of the
settlement package, which includes cash payments and the purchase
of annuities that will pay dividends to Travis and his parents over
the next 50 years, said medical center President Russell Tolman.
   ``The medical center continues to believe the care in this
situation was adequate and there was no negligence on the part of
Fort Worth Children's Hospital or its doctors,'' Tolman said.
   The Williamses intend to use the money to build a home designed
for a disabled person and to hire a full-time nurse, said the
family's attorney, Darrell Keith. They are also planning to
purchase a van with a wheelchair lift, he said.

<HEAD>Prime Minister Says Proposed Constitutional Reforms to Limit
King's Power</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of the pro-democracy movement now
governing this Himalayan kingdom said Wednesday that a new
constitution soon to be drafted would sharply reduce the king's
power.
   Prime Minister Krishna Prasad Bhattarai criticized the near
absolute power wielded by the monarchy for the past 29 years under
the partyless system of government known as the Panchayat.
   Bhattarai told a meeting organized by the Nepali Journalists
Association that the proposed constitutional reforms would ``review
the powers of the king and the active role the king has played.''
   The meeting was called to honor journalists jailed during the
recent seven-week campaign to restore multiparty democracy. The
protests forced King Birendra to lift a 29-year ban on political
parties last month and turn over the government to an interim
coalition made up of pro-democracy forces.
   Bhattarai, whose centrist Nepali Congress Party is the largest
group in the new coalition government, said ``the active role given
to the king during the Panchayat system was not appropriate.''
   Ganesh Man Singh, the head of the Nepali Congress Party,
indicated that the king's role would be reduced to that of a
constitutional monarch.
   The ``king will have to remain under the constitution,'' Singh
told the journalists' meeting. ``We will not allow him to go either
an inch above or an inch below the constitution.''
   Bhattarai said the new government's main priorities are to draft
a new constitution and prepare for free elections that will be held
within a year.
   He said a constitution drafting committee would be set up soon,
and would be expected to complete its work within three months.
   In his other remarks, Bhattarai reported progress in efforts to
resolve a trade and transit dispute with India.
   He said Indian Prime Minister V.P. Singh had expressed his
willingness to settle the dispute as soon as possible during a
meeting in New Delhi with Nepal's finance minister, Devendra Raj
Pandey.
   Pandey was in the Indian capital to attend the annual meeting of
the Asian Development Bank.
   India has closed all but two of the 15 crossing points along its
border with landlocked Nepal since March when a trade and transit
treaty expired. The move has caused a sharp increase in Nepal in
the price of essential imports, including gasoline and medicine.
   So far negotiations between the two countries on a renewal or
new treaty have been unsuccessful.
   Bhattarai's coalition government, which also includes members of
a leftist coalition, independents and two Birendra appointees, took
power April 19.
   That ended the nearly three decades-long hold on power by the
monarchy under the Panchayat system, which was introduced by
Birendra's father, King Mahendra.
   The partyless system was imposed in December 1960 after Mahendra
dismissed the democratically elected Nepali Congress Party
government, accusing it of corruption and poor administration.
   The recent pro-democracy campaign climaxed on April 6 when
police fired at pro-democracy demonstrators marching on the royal
palace in Katmandu. Witnesses said at least 200 people were killed,
but Birendra's government maintained that only 10 people were
killed in the entire country on that day.
   The public outcry of the shooting forced Birendra to restore
multiparty democracy.

   Ship lovers on Wednesday feared the SS Milwaukee
Clipper would ride its last wave into a junk heap, sold for scrap.
Instead, the 85-year-old landmark steamer is headed for a new dock.
   At an auction in U.S. District Court, officials of Hammond,
Ind.'s Port Authority outbid their only other competitor, buying
the former grande dame of Great Lake ferries for $335,000.
   The SS Clipper had fallen on hard financial times, ousted first
from Chicago's Navy Pier over a rent dispute, then from its mooring
on the Chicago River. In recent times, it has languished at a dock
on Lake Michigan in downtown Chicago.
   Creditors were knocking on the door of its former owner, James
Gillon. The 361-foot ship was subject to a maritime mortgage lien
and, by mutual agreement of owner and creditors, was turned over to
federal authorities in February for sale, said attorney Alan Amos,
who helped in the auction.
   Wednesday's auction, conducted by U.S. marshals, required a
minimum of $100,000 for the ship, which has been designated a
national historic landmark and boasts one of the few remaining
quadruple expansion steam engines.
   Six bidders submitted the required $25,000 deposit to take part
in the auction. But only Hammond and one other group, Specialty
Restaurants Inc. _ which wanted to turn the ship into a floating
nightclub _ vyed for the vessel.
   Robert Kenney, chairman of the Hammond Port Authority, said the
ship would anchor a new yacht harbor being developed in the
northwestern Indiana city. Once transported from Chicago, the
Clipper will be revamped to accommodate a restaurant and pavillion
for the harbor, Kenney said.
   The SS Clipper has made its home in the Great Lakes since its
construction in 1905 in Cleveland.
   The ship, which carried 900 passengers and 120 automobiles, was
first used as an excursion liner between Buffalo, N.Y., and Duluth,
Minn., said Thatcher Waller, collections manager at the Chicago
Maritime Society, which runs a small maritime museum.
   It was restored in 1940 and, during the summer, would carry
passengers and their cars between different Lake Michigan
destinations.
   ``This was a liner that went out for a crossing of six hours. It
had state rooms on board, the whole bid,'' said Waller.
   During winter, when tourist use slacked off, the ship was
enlisted to carry new cars from Detroit to cities on Lake
Michigan's southern shore, he said.
   The ship was taken out of service in 1970 and moved to Chicago
by its former owner, Gillon, who began a second restoration. Gillon
hoped eventually to sail it again, said Waller, who worked on the
restoration.
   But the Coast Guard sought massive work before the ship could be
declared ready to steam, and Gillon eventually settled for using
the ship as a floating banquet hall before financial problems led
it onto the auction block.
   Several scrappers inquired about buying the Clipper for junk,
but the steamer instead will soon be towed by another ship to
Hammond, said Kenney.
   ``I don't think Chicago was really ever aware of the gem that it
had,'' Waller said. ``People need an awareness of their history.''

   Banned and vilified by white
leaders, the African National Congress has achieved a goal sought
throughout its 78-year history: talks with the government on ending
white domination.
   The ANC, South Africa's most powerful opposition group, began
meeting with the government Wednesday to clear the way for
negotiations on a constitution that will give the voteless black
majority a voice in government.
   Even before the talks began, ANC leaders described the meeting
as a triumph for the organization, founded in 1912 to fight for
black political rights.
   ``It is a new lease of life,'' said ANC leader Reg September,
who returned to South Africa last week after 27 years in exile.
``We will take full advantage of this and move forward to a new
South Africa.''
   In this divided country, the ANC and its close ally, the United
Democratic Front, are the largest political organizations with a
multiracial leadership.
   The ANC's rank-and-file is overwhelmingly black and male, but
the 11-person delegation meeting with the government is comprised
of six black men, two black women, two white men and an Indian man.
   The government side is made up exclusively of male Afrikaners,
descendents of Dutch who account for 3 million of the country's 5
million whites.
   The ANC has millions of black supporters in South Africa and an
estimated 15,000 members in exile. Many exiles are expected to
return this year and most observers believe the group would win
elections if the country's 28 million blacks were allowed to vote.
   Several ANC rallies have attracted crowds of more than 100,000
people since February, when President F.W. de Klerk legalized the
organization after a 30-year ban and freed Nelson Mandela after 27
years in prison.
   Before de Klerk assumed power last August, government officials
frequently denounced the ANC as a Communist-inspired terrorist
group that would be barred from any negotiations.
   But de Klerk has initiated reforms, saying he wants to negotiate
an end to apartheid, which has allowed the white minority to
maintain political and economic control over blacks.
   However, he opposes the outright black majority rule favored by
the ANC and other anti-apartheid groups.
   Throughout its history, the ANC has been led by older,
well-educated blacks who have sought a negotiated solution to the
country's race and political conflicts.
   Albert Lutuli, ANC president in the 1950s and winner of the
Nobel Peace Prize, repeatedly wrote to white leaders requesting a
meeting. The government never consented, instead outlawing the
then-peaceful ANC in 1960.
   A year later, Mandela, a lawyer, helped launch the ANC's
guerrilla campaign, saying it was the only way to oppose apartheid.
Most of the leadership was soon arrested or went into exile, and
headquarters were established in Lusaka, Zambia.
   The armed struggle, which the ANC still embraces, has never
posed a serious threat to the government. But it has won the
support of black youths who have received their political education
in street clashes with security forces.
   One of the ANC's biggest challenges will be to maintain control
of its young supporters as the anti-apartheid movement moves from
confrontation to negotiation.
   During nationwide unrest in the mid-1980s, the ANC publicly
stated that it wanted to make South Africa ``ungovernable.''
   Now, Mandela and other ANC leaders are sending mixed signals,
urging supporters to be peaceful and disciplined, but saying the
armed struggle should continue.
   In the southeastern province of Natal, fighting between ANC
supporters and Inkatha, a relatively conservative Zulu group, has
claimed 4,000 black lives since 1986. The conflict has intensified
in recent months despite pleas for peace by both factions and the
government.
   The government has urged the ANC to formally suspend its largely
dormant armed struggle. But should the ANC do so, it would risk
losing young supporters to more militant groups such as the Pan
Africanist Congress.

   The White House said Wednesday it has seen no
signs pointing toward release of another American hostage in
Lebanon.
   Meanwhile, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President
Bush will meet with Frank Reed if the ex-hostage wants to when he
returns to the United States.
   Questioned about the message Reed reportedly was asked to carry
to Washington by his captors, Fitzwater said, ``I'm not aware of
anything.''
   Bush administration officials indicated Tuesday there was
nothing new in the oral message another freed hostage, Robert
Polhill, relayed to Bush in a White House meeting Monday.
   Fitzwater, asked Wednesday about reports that Iranian officials
were still working to seek freedom for Western hostages, said, ``We
don't have any other indications of a release.''
   Reed, recuperating at a U.S. Air Force hospital in Wiesbaden,
West Germany, said Wednesday he was ``very, very angry'' that Terry
Anderson and Thomas Sutherland were still hostages. Both were
kidnapped in 1985.
   ``Mr. Reed is free to say whatever he wants. I'm sure he was
reflecting briefings he has received about the status of events,
but he is free to say whatever he likes,'' said Fitzwater.
   Of Reed, the spokesman said, ``I'm sure if he wants to come in
and see the president, a meeting will be arranged. He certainly has
every right to do that. ... He has not indicated to us what his
preferences are.''
   At the State Department, deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said
the United States is making indirect contacts with Iran through
third parties, including Switzerland, which represents U.S.
interests in Tehran.
   ``We continue to hope that further hostages will be released,''
said Boucher.
   Sixteen Westerners, including six Americans, remain hostages in
Lebanon. Polhill was freed April 22 after 39 months in captivity;
Reed on Monday after 43 months.
   On Tuesday, Fitzwater said all American hostages must be freed
before the United States can move beyond the ``small gestures'' of
thanks already shown to Iran.

<HEAD>Two Bombs Explode in Colombia, Four Policemen Wounded</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bombs exploded Wednesday in two
Colombian cities where major cocaine cartels are based, and
authorities said four policemen were wounded.
   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the blasts.
However, since drug traffickers offered rewards three months ago
for each policeman killed, 122 officers have been slain, most of
them by bombs.
   In other developments:
   _The People's Liberation Army, a leftist guerrilla group,
kidnapped a federal senator, a radio station said.
   _Another guerrilla group, the National Liberation Army,
reportedly said it wants former President Jimmy Carter to mediate
peace talks with the government. Two bombs were hurled from a
speeding car at a police station in the western city of Cali at
5:30 a.m. Wednesday, police said.
   Four policemen were wounded, Lt. Erik Bendec of the national
police force in Cali told The Associated Press.
   In the northwestern city of Medellin, a bomb exploded before
dawn just outside the local national police headquarters, a police
spokeswoman said.
   The bomb left a crater 20 feet deep and 30 feet wide but caused
no injuries, a woman identifying herself only as Lt. Drusila told
the AP.
   The nation's two largest cocaine cartels are based in Cali and
Medellin. Before Colombia declared war on the traffickers, the two
cartels reportedly were responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine
smuggled into the United States.
   Sen. Roman Gomez Ovalle was abducted Tuesday near the northern
town of Villanueva, in the state of Guajira, radio network RCN said
Wednesday in a report that quoted members of the family.
   The guerrillas later told the family that the senator was
kidnapped as part of the rebel group's attempt to start peace talks
with the government.
   Colombian guerrillas frequently kidnap government officials or
journalists and release them with messages for the government.
   Gomez was abducted by the People's Liberation Army, RCN quoted
the family as saying. The group recently proposed peace talks with
the government.
   The National Liberation Army, a hard-line Marxist guerrilla
group that had said it would never give up its struggle, now wants
Carter to mediate in talks with the government, reporters taken to
a rebel encampment said Tuesday.
   In addition to mediating peace talks in Ethiopia's guerrilla
conflict, Carter played a prominent role in certifying that
Nicaragua's recent presidential election was fair. He also has been
invited to oversee elections in Hungary, Romania and the Dominican
Republic.
   The Colombian government already has rejected the idea of
mediation by Carter or President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela.
However, the fact that the National Liberation Army offered to hold
peace talks for the first time is significant and could lead to
other offers acceptable to the government.
   The National Liberation Army proposal was relayed by three
reporters, a television camerman and a lawyer who were kidnapped by
guerrillas. The five people were taken to a guerrilla encampment on
Monday, the group said Wednesday in broadcast interviews. All five
were released unharmed Tuesday.
   The National Liberation Army has been the most anti-American of
the guerrilla groups in Colombia. It has concentrated most of its
attacks on Colombia's oil industry, including American oil
companies.
   The group also said it was declaring a unilateral cease-fire
through the May 27 presidential elections, the reporters said. Past
cease-fire offers from guerrilla groups often have been violated.

   Smirnoff, the vodka of czars that was
banished during the Bolshevik Revolution, is going back to the
U.S.S.R. as the distillation of ``all that is chic and fashionable
about America.'' What a country.
   ``From a lifestyle point of view, Russians look to Smirnoff as
an American symbol, which in a way is ironic,'' said Vivian Brooks,
public relations director for Heublein Inc., which distills the
Russian-born spirit.
   Heublein, the Farmington-based liquor and wine company, is
taking advantage of easing East-West trade restraints to ship
Smirnoff back to the Soviet Union, where it was first distilled in
Moscow in 1818 by Peter Smirnoff.
   It's not like shipping coals to Newcastle, Brooks said. Smirnoff
will be marketed to compete with hundreds of vodka brands in the
Soviet Union.
   ``Smirnoff has really reached the point where it represents all
that is chic and fashionable about America,'' Brooks said.
   Smirnoffs were official suppliers of vodka and liqueurs to the
Imperial Court until the family business was seized by the Red Army
in 1917, and proprietor Vladimir Smirnoff was jailed under a
sentence of death.
   Freed by the White Army, Vladimir escaped to France and sold the
family formula to fellow emigre Rudolph Kunett, who made his way to
the United States, set up his distillery in Bethel and sold out to
Heublein in 1939.

   Here are some excerpts from
remarks made Wednesday to reporters by freed hostage Frank Reed at
the U.S. Air Force hospital in Wiesbaden:
   ``I tell you, I'm very, very angry that Anderson ... Tom and
Terry ... are not free.'' (Reed was referring to two of the six
remaining American captives in Lebanon _ Terry Anderson, The
Associated Press chief Middle East correspondent and the
longest-held Western hostage, and Thomas Sutherland, an American
educator).
   ``I spent the good part of two years with Tom and Terry. Those
were the only people I knew. I have not seen Tom and Terry for a

nearly the sixth year for these men. I'm absolutely embarrassed I'm
out before they are.''

   Reed also said that he spent three years in the intermittent
company of John McCarthy and Brian Keenan, two British hostages.
   ``I have been with John and Brian since last October. I've spent
almost three years either with John and Brian or having them
somewhere in the house with me.
   ``I can assure you and the people of England that John and Brian
are well and alive.''

   Reed also described his attitude to the U.S. government.
   ``I thought I was (angry with U.S. officials), but I don't think
I am now. On the basis of information I have received ... it
appears to me perhaps we are on the right track to getting these
people out.''

   Reed also talked about his stay in the hospital and plans for
going home.
   ``I'd like to stay another week or two, but they want me out of
here on Friday. ... Actually, it's not very good here (at the
hospital), and I don't recommend you come in.
   ``I'd like to have a big Maine lobster, about three pounds (when
he gets home).''

   A Swede whose conviction in the 1986
murder of Prime Minister Olof Palme was overturned last October was
awarded $49,000 in damages Wednesday for the 10 months he spent in
custody.
   Christer Pettersson had sought $325,000. Attorney General Hans
Stark, in setting the award, said he was influenced by Pettersson's
long criminal record and lifestyle as an admitted alcoholic, the TT
news agency said.
   Pettersson was arrested in December 1988 and charged with the
shooting. He was sentenced the following July to life imprisonment
but then was freed in October by an appeals court that cited a lack
of evidence.
   ``I thought he'd get more, but the government is rather miserly
with compensation for psychological suffering,'' said Pettersson's
lawyer Arne Liljeros. He said his client was ``marked for life.''
   Police investigating the murder have said Pettersson remains a
suspect.
   Palme, a four-term prime minister, was fatally shot while
walking home with his wife from a movie. The gunman escaped down a
dark street.

   American inventor Philo T. Farnsworth, a
pioneer of television, was accorded what many believe was long
overdue glory Wednesday when a 7-foot bronze likeness of the
electronics genius was dedicated in the U.S. Capitol.
   With his 81-year-old widow, Elma Farnsworth, looking on, the
inventor was extolled as the father of television and his statue
was placed in the pantheon of famous Americans of the Capitol's
National Statuary Hall.
   ``I think it's an honor long overdue,'' said Bruce Barnson, who
headed a commission that raised $250,000 to place Farnsworth near
the likeness of a better-known Utahn, Brigham Young.
   ``I want to thank you all from the bottom of my heart ... for
this great honor,'' Mrs. Farnsworth told an audience at the Capitol
dedication.
   The ceremony included songs from the school choir from
Ridgecrest Elementary School in Butler, Utah. Students from
Ridgecrest started the drive for the statue after they surveyed
Utah residents and recommended to the state legislature that
Farnsworth be the second Utahn honored in Statuary Hall.
   The statue by Utah sculptor James Avanti depicts Farnsworth
holding an image dissector tube that was the heart of the
electronic television system that he first conceived as a
15-year-old high school student in 1922.
   Farnsworth is called in an inscription at on the base of the
statue the ``Father of Television.''
   Farnsworth gained the first patent on his system, the precursor
of today's television, in 1934 after winning a patent battle with
the powerful RCA corporation, which later paid him $1 million to
use his many patents. Most history books list Farnsworth only as
one of many early pioneers of television.
   He died in 1971 while working on fusion research. He had
contributed more than 160 inventions, including radar and the
electron microscope. He was named to the National Inventors Hall of
Fame in 1984.
   Each state is allowed to honor two of its famous citizens with
statues in Statuary Hall. But Utah had placed only Young in the
hall.

<HEAD>Space Telescope Resumes Work After Mistake Shuts it Down</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An error by a ground controller put the Hubble
Space Telescope to sleep again overnight but the $1.5 billion
instrument was re-awakened Wednesday and was functioning normally
again.
   It was the third time since the telescope was put into open
space April 25 that its electronics were powered down to prevent
damage.
   NASA said the controller at the Goddard Space Flight Center
failed to send a signal telling the telescope's lens cover not to
close during a testing operation. The 10-foot diameter cover shut
and its motion caused the telescope to go into a ``safe-mode.''
   ``The spacecraft operated just as it should have,'' the space
agency said in a statement. ``The problem was caused by ground
controller oversight.''
   In the safe-mode, the telescope automatically maintains its
position, points its solar arrays to the sun to receive power and
activates other functions to protect the spacecraft.
   The system is designed to safeguard the telescope for 72 hours
without ground control.
   It happened the first time on Friday when engineers sent
commands to open the lens cover, formally known as the aperture
door. Cautious engineers had set the software to accommodate only a
slight bit of motion and the movement of the door exceeded that
limit.
   The second time was also Friday, when one of the telescope's two
high-gain antennas was put through its movements. A counterweight
on the dish antenna brushed against a cable and the efforts by a
motor to overcome the resistance again shut the system down.
   The biggest impact of Tuesday night's events, NASA said, was
that 10 hours in the lengthy start-up and calibration process were
lost. But spokesman Jim Elliott said no delay was expected in
getting the first picture from the telescope early Saturday.
   When the telescope first went into its safe-mode last week, the
recovery process was a lengthy one. But NASA said Wednesday that
problems of that nature are expected during a start-up process that
will take more than six months before the first real scientific
returns.

<HEAD>Fed Survey Finds Continued Slow Economic Growth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Federal Reserve survey of regional economic
conditions released Wednesday found continued slow growth in April
and little sign that industrial prices were rising too fast.
   ``Overall economic activity continues to expand slowly,'' the
central bank said in a survey known as the ``Beige Book,'' prepared
by its 12 regional banks for a May 15 monetary policy meeting.
   The Fed's evaluation of the economy was similar to its last two
surveys in March and January, which also reported slow but
continued expansion and moderate inflation.
   However, two separate Commerce Department reports Wednesday
indicate economic activity may be rebounding at a faster pace than
shown by the Fed survey.
   The government's Index of Leading Economic Indicators jumped 0.9
in March, the biggest gain in 21 months. Meanwhile, factory orders
rose 3.8 percent in March for the largest increase in more than a
year.
   Based on the survey alone, the Fed would appear to be unlikely
to move interest rates either up or down, said economist Robert G.
Dederick of Chicago's Northern Trust Co. However, Fed policy-makers
likely will perceive more danger of inflation than indicated by the
report, he said.
   They likely will be especially concerned with consumer prices,
which advanced at an 8.5 percent annual rate during the first three
months of this year, compared with a 4.6 percent rate for all of
1989, he said.
   ``This particular report does not point to the need for any
tightening (of credit). This says `Stay as you are.' However, my
own view is the odds are they will tighten,'' Dederick said.
   For most of 1988 and early last year, the Fed nudged rates
higher to slow the economy and combat inflation. During the last
half of 1989, it permitted rates to fall in an effort to avoid a
recession. Since then, it's held short-term rates steady.
   In the latest survey, most districts report that manufacturing,
which had been particularly affected by the higher rates, has
either improved or is expected to improve. Despite that, ``no
general upward pressure on industrial prices is noted,'' it said.
   Responding to recent concerns expressed by business groups and
members of Congress about a regulatory crackdown on bank lending,
the Fed said its regional banks found ``little evidence that a
general credit crunch is developing.''
   However, it noted, ``virtually every district cites some
specific cases of credit tightening by banks, with the most
significant action taken by New England banks. ... Still, the
majority of businesses say they have not seen any change in credit
terms and have not had trouble getting loans.''
   Real estate, particularly apartment construction, remains weak,
the Fed said. Housing prices continue to fall in the New York
metropolitan area and in New England, but there are ``pockets of
strength'' in parts of California, in Minneapolis-St. Paul and in
upstate and western New York.
   The central bank survey also pointed to some resilience in the
consumer sector, which accounts for two-thirds of the nations'
economic activity.
   ``Retail sales ... reflect slow, positive growth. ... Apparel
has been especially strong in most districts,'' the report said.
   Agriculture, particularly apple and peach crops, was damaged by
the cold, wet weather early in the spring, the Fed said. Farmers
are optimistic because recent rains have diminished drought fears,
it said.

<HEAD>Congress Probing Proposed Swap of Coal for Scenic View</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A congressional panel is investigating the
proposed swap of coal-rich Wyoming land for a scenic view in Grand
Teton National Park _ a deal the panel's chairman calls a ``fire
sale'' that will hurt taxpayers.
   Federal and state governments could lose up to $180 million
because of the low value Interior Department officials placed on
the coal it is trading, according to documents compiled by the
House Government Operations environment subcommittee.
   The department wants to trade a 2,500-acre tract with 207
million tons of coal for a ``conservation easement'' _ basically a
scenic view _ on a ranch in Grand Teton park owned by
businessman-conservationist Laurance S. Rockefeller.
   Rockefeller has donated the easement to a New York cancer
institute, which would gain the coal tract under the swap.
Rockefeller would retain ownership of the land. The government gets
a ban on development, preserving the view.
   The Interior Department denied the deal is a bad one for
taxpayers.
   ``There's no mystery to how we did it,'' said Jay Guerin, a
spokesman for Interior's Bureau of Land Management. ``It's the same
as other evaluations. It compares to other kinds of tracts and
leases involving the federal government.''
   The committee plans to question Interior officials on the deal
at a hearing Thursday. Panel Chairman Mike Synar, D-Okla. is
questioning the decision to value both the easement and the coal at
$5.6 million, saying the value of the coal is much higher.
   Synar said Wednesday it ``strains credulity'' that the
department valued the 207 million tons of coal it will give up at
2.7 cents a ton.
   ``At a time of staggering federal deficits, the Department of
the Interior should abandon any thought of disposing of publicly
owned assets at fire sale prices,'' Synar said.
   The 2,500-acre Youngs Creek Tract is located near Sheridan, Wyo.
The J-Y Ranch is the largest privately owned section of the park.
   Rockefeller in 1987 donated the scenic view to the
Sloan-Kettering Memorial Institute for Cancer Research.
   While the department said 2.7 cents a ton is the right value for
undeveloped coal in the ground, with no certain market, Synar
believes the value should be based on the price that mined coal
would bring.
   When coal is mined on federal land, the government and the state
where the vein is located share a royalty of 12.5 percent of the of
the selling price.
   In March 1989 Paul R. Cleary, deputy commissioner of the Wyoming
State Land and Farm Loan Office, wrote another state official:
``Assuming a value of $7 per ton and a royalty rate of 12.5
percent, development of the federal coal would generate over $180
million in royalties, of which the state would receive ... some $90
million.''
   According to the publication Coal Week, which follows current
prices, similar, mined coal in Wyoming sold in mid-April for $4.60
per ton on long term contracts (usually 15-25 years) and $3.80 to
$4.60 for contracts under a year.
   At $4.60, the federal-state royalty would be about $119 million.
At $3.80 it would total some $98 million.
   Guerin, the Interior Department spokesman, said, ``The 2.7 cents
is the value of undeveloped, speculative coal with no mine nearby.
Speculative means there is no current market for the coal.''
   ``The 2.7 cents is a raw product. To make money off that
product, you have to put in all kinds of money to develop it,'' he
said.
   To bolster the argument that the deal is unfavorable for
taxpayers, the committee released documents indicating the coal
would be mined and not sit in the ground.
   Bruce A. Bugbee, an attorney who will represent Sloan-Kettering
at Thursday's hearing, wrote Interior officials last November:
``Sloan-Kettering has identified parties interested in purchasing
the coal who are willing to provide assurances they will proceed
immediately ... with the goal of obtaining permits prior to 1995.''
   In addition, Ash Creek Mining Co., of Tulsa, Okla., has
protested the exchange to the department, saying it had sought a
federal lease to mine coal on the tract. Synar's office said the
investigation has no connection to the fact that Ash Creek is
headquartered in his state.

dependents have left Liberia in recent days as rebel forces have
moved to within striking distance of the capital, the State
Department said Wednesday.
   Deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said he expects that by this
weekend, 400 of the 500 official Americans and their dependents
will have left the country.
   He said the exodus was not an evacuation but an ``authorized
voluntary departure.'' All those who have left have done so on
regular commercial flights.
   Before the departures got under way, there were about 5,000
Americans in Liberia. There are no precise figures available on the
number Americans in unofficial capacities who have left.
   The government of President Samuel K. Doe has come under
increasing pressure since late last year from a rebel group
believed to have received financial support from Libya.
   International relief agencies estimate 250,000 Liberians have
been uprooted from their homes since the fighting started. Many
have gone to neighboring Guinea or the Ivory Coast.
   U.S. officials blame excesses by both government and rebel
forces for the large number of displaced persons.
   The fighting had been confined largely to the interior of the
country but the rebels recently have been able to advance to areas
along the Atlantic coast, encountering minimal resistance from
government forces.
   The Liberian-American Co. rubber plantation, 60 miles east of
the capital of Monrovia, is in rebel hands.
   ``The Liberian armed forces have evaporated outside of
Monrovia,'' one official said.
   The State Department has called on the government and the rebel
movement, led by Charles Taylor, to cease the violence. It also has
asked the government to create conditions that will permit
displaced Liberians to return to their homes.
   U.S. authorities have asked the opposing sides to pursue a
policy of national reconciliation and ensure a climate for
elections set for 1991.
   Doe observed his 10th anniversary in power last month. His
relationship with the United States has been uneasy because of
alleged human rights violations and economic policies that U.S.
officials consider to be unwise.
   Liberia has been ineligible for U.S. development assistance for
years because of failure to repay loans.
   Liberia was founded a century and a half ago by freed American
slaves and generally has had close ties with the United States
since then.

   Residents of this rural town are mourning
for three volunteer firefighters who died while trying to help a
neighbor clean out a 38-foot well and were overcome by gas.
   The deaths were the first in the nearly 25-year history of the
170-member volunteer company in this mountainous region of
south-central Pennsylvania, said Assistant Chief Robert Covert.
   ``They were good-hearted people,'' Covert said Wednesday while
he and others lingered at the firehouse. ``That's why they got in
trouble. They were too good-hearted. They would never tell anybody
no.''
   James F. Chestnut Jr., 20, and Richard L. Hershey, 40, both of
Hustontown, and Thomas L. Lane, 39, of McConnellsburg, died Tuesday
apparently from methane gas that had built up in the hand-dug well,
state police said.
   About two dozen other people were treated at the Fulton County
Medical Center, including at least six men who inhaled some of the
gas, police said.
   The firefighters went to the home of Nellie Brown west of town
on Monday to pump out her well. She had complained of the odor and
suspected an animal had fallen in and died.
   The volunteers used the pump on their truck without success and
returned Tuesday afternoon with a portable pump, state police said.
   Lane and Larry Traxler of Hustontown entered the well with the
pump and took it about halfway down the 3-foot wide shaft. Traxler
became dizzy and returned to the surface, but Lane was overcome.
Traxler went back for him, but also lost consciousness.
   Hershey and Traxler's father, Clair, 41, went in, but Hershey
was overcome. Others on the surface then called for additional help.
   One company member, Ed Karczewski, 23, was home with his
22-year-old fiancee, Pam Crouse, when he heard the call for help
over the company radio.
   ``I heard him scream over the air that two men were trapped in a
well,'' Karczewski said. He and Ms. Crouse got to the scene just as
Chestnut was heading down to help.
   ``I watched Jimmy go down into the well and I heard this
screaming like I never heard before,'' Karczewski said, his eyes
filling with tears.
   He said he felt helpless.
   ``I mean our hands were tied. We can't be trained for
everything. We did the best we could and it wasn't good enough,''
he said.
   Firefighter Howard Melott, 21, of Hustontown removed Chestnut
and Traxler. Traxler was revived. Lane fell into water at the
bottom of the well and was the last to be removed, three or four
hours later.
   Covert said firefighters usually wear air packs when they enter
areas that might be contaminated, but he said the men thought the
problem in the well was caused by a dead animal.
   Lane and Chestnut were with the fire company since they were
junior members, while Hershey joined about three years ago, Covert
said.
   The mood in the town of about 400 people was quiet Wednesday.
Clusters of people were at the firehouse. White puffs of spent
dandelions perched on spindly shoots in the pale green fields that
run to the ridges framing the narrow valleys.
   Firefighter Karczewski said he hopes other fire companies learn
from their tragedy. ``They should step back and look at it,'' he
said.
   The funerals are set for Friday and Monday. In the meantime,
other companies are handling fire calls.
   Thomas Moriarty, who heads a stress-coping team from
Shippensburg University, said he and others talked with about 65
firefighters and ambulance workers Tuesday night.
   ``We let them know that they are perfectly normal and they are
not losing their minds and it's OK to hurt,'' he said.

<HEAD>Bush Pays Taxes Omitted in Error</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush had to pay an additional $7,497
in federal income taxes Wednesday due to an error in the reporting
of his 1989 income, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   The president had to file an amended return because the one he
sent to the IRS last month did not include income from deferred
compensation he collected last year.
   He was eligible for that compensation when he turned 65 last
June 12, under an arrangement with Zapata Corp., the now-defunct
oil company he once headed, Fitzwater said. The added income was
brought to the attention of the tax preparers after they had
submitted his tax return last month, according to the explanation
on his amended form.
   The deferred compensation was received in the form of a paid-up
life insurance policy and should have been reported because it had
a cash value.
   The life insurance policy was valued at $26,250.
   The president paid interest of $40.77, which accrued on the
unpaid tax for 15 days since the income tax filing deadline,
Fitzwater said.
   There was no penalty, Fitzwater said, because the mistake was
deemed to be due to ``reasonable cause.''
   With the mistake corrected, Bush paid total taxes of $108,879 on
income of $483,030.

<HEAD>Calls Rise For Feds to Fight Telephone Sales Fraud</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers, state attorneys general and
consumer agency officials called on Wednesday for federal
legislation that would make it easier to fight the $1 billion
telephone sales fraud industry.
   ``For many people the telephone is becoming a way to reach out
and rob someone,'' said Rep. Thomas A. Luken, D-Ohio.
   Janet Steiger, chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission, said
consumers lose more than $1 billion annually to telemarketing scams.
   ``Current enforcement authority is not sufficient to swiftly and
effectively deal with those who defraud the American consumer,''
said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., as the Senate Commerce Committee's
consumer subcommittee considered two bills to require the FTC to
issue rules governing telemarketing.
   A House committee last fall approved similar legislation
sponsored by Luken.
   Steiger said the agency already has increased efforts ``to
attack the root of fraud, such as suppliers and other aiders and
abettors'' of soliciting operations.
   Telephone fraud has grown widely in recent years for operations
that offer phony prizes and try to sell shoddy merchandise,
including supposedly rare gemstones coins.
   Steiger also said the FTC also has increased cooperation with
the states.
   The proposed legislation would require the FTC to develop rules
for and define telemarketing.
   It would allow states and individuals to file federal suit for
alleged violation of those rules. Currently, they can only sue in
state courts and the FTC sues in federal court.
   In addition, one provision would address what Bryan called
``buyer's remorse'' by giving consumers a ``cooling-off period'' or
specified time in which they could change their minds before a
telephone purchase became final.
   Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., said the problem requires a federal
response because fraudalent telemarketers often evade prosecution
merely by moving from one state to another.
   ``The nature of a telemarketing operation is not a fixed
location,'' said Bryan, who heads the subcommittee.
   The National Association of Consumer Agency Administrators, the
National Association of Attorneys General, the Direct Marketing
Association and the National Tour Association support the proposed
legislation.

   Despite ballyhooed efforts at education
reform, student achievement is continuing a decline that began
three years ago, the government said Wednesday in a controversial
report.
   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos said the annual state-by-state
performance chart, popularly called the wall chart, ``makes it
clear that, as a nation, we are still not seriously committed to
improving education for all Americans.''
   The chart has been criticized as promoting flawed data and
making unfair state comparisons. Timothy Dyer, executive director
of the National Association of Secondary School Principals, said
American ``young people are simply too complex to hang on a wall.''
   The chart, he said, ``has as much to offer educational
improvement as the Edsel offered the automotive industry.''
   Cavazos, however, defended the chart.
   ``It is the only national measurement of educational
performance,'' he said. ``It's the best that we have. Until we
develop other measures, we will have to rely on the wall chart.''
   Officials say the White House argued for abandoning the
7-year-old practice this year because President Bush and the
nation's governors had worked to develop national education goals
and still are devising more accurate forms of assessment.
   The report found that the average American College Testing
Program examination scores declined nationally by 0.2 of a point,
to 18.6, from 1988 to 1989, while the average Scholastic Aptitude
Test scores declined by one point, to 903, during the same period.
   A perfect ACT score is 36; a perfect SAT score is 1,600.
   The test scores are used by colleges and universities as one
standard of admission.
   The report also found that the national high school graduation
rate declined from 71.7 percent to 71.1 percent from 1987 to 1988;
the percentage of public high school graduates who received a
qualifying score on advanced placement examinations declined from
8.8 percent to 8.6 percent between 1988 and 1989.
   Bill Honig, California superintendent of public instruction,
said the chart ``causes more mischief than benefit'' because much
of the data is a rehash of statistics already made public.
   Keith Geiger, president of the National Education Association,
said the chart ``only continues to confuse and frustrate the
public.''
   Monty Neill, associate director of the National Center for Fair
&amp; Open Testing, said the chart should include a consumer protection
label: ``Warning! Misuse of Standardized Test Scores Can Damange
the Nation's Educational Health.''
   Neill said the administration uses misleading and inaccurate
scores from multiple-choice exams to rate the quality of education.
He said using standardized test scores to compare school systems is
a technique that even test manufacturers oppose.
   Of the 28 states that offer the ACT, the report said, North
Dakota, Alabama, Nevada and Utah showed the greatest improvement
between 1982 and 1989. Improving in SAT scores during the same
years were South Carolina, Hawaii, the District of Columbia,
Maryland and New Jersey.
   States showing a decline in ACT scores were Alaska, Minnesota,
Nebraska, Wisconsin and Iowa. Declining in SAT scores were New
York, Florida, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Delaware.
   However, the highest scoring states on the ACT were Iowa,
Wisconsin, Montana, Minnesota, Colorado and Nebraska. Highest
scoring states on the SAT were New Hampshire, Oregon, Maryland,
Connecticut and California.
   The report said that the states with the highest graduation
rates in 1988 were Minnesota at 90.9 percent, North Dakota 88.3
percent, Wyoming 88.3 percent, Montana 87.3 percent and Iowa 85.8
percent.
   States with the lowest graduation rates in 1988 were Florida at
58 percent, the District of Columbia 58.2 percent, Georgia 61
percent, Arizona 61.1 percent and Louisiana 61.4 percent.
   ``Too many people believe that the education deficit is somebody
else's problem, that somebody else's schools are the ones that
don't work, that somebody else's children are the ones who are
failing to learn,'' Cavazos said.

<HEAD>Gadhafi Reportedly Offered to Dismantle Poison Gas Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY BETH SHERIDAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Libyan government secretly offered to
dismantle a plant that U.S officials said produces poison gas
shortly before a fire was reported there in March, diplomats said.
   The offer was contingent on Western countries paying
``compensation'' and agreeing to build a pharmaceutical factory to
replace the plant, Western and Middle Eastern diplomats based in
Tripoli said Tuesday and Wednesday.
   Libya has claimed the plant in Rabta, 60 miles southwest of
Tripoli, produces pharmaceuticals.
   The offer was not accepted, but some diplomats say it is
significant because it indicates Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi is
moving to resolve the bitter clash with the United States over the
plant.
   ``This shows that at least some Libyans (in the government) ...
are keen to have the Rabta problem solved, in such a way that will
not make Libya lose face,'' one Western diplomat said.
   He pointed out that the Rabta plant was an obstacle to Libya's
recent efforts to end its international isolation.
   But other diplomats said the offer could merely have been an
attempt to head off a possible U.S. military strike at the plant.
   The proposal comes at a time when Libya and the United States
appear to have quietly resumed indirect contacts, said the
diplomats, who spoke on condition their names not be used.
   Numerous requests for interviews at the Libyan foreign ministry
were not granted and lower-ranking officials refused comment.
   The cause and extent of the March fire at Rabta are still
unknown.
   The United States initially said the blaze caused heavy damage
to the plant.
   But later news reports said U.S. authorities, after a review of
satellite photographs, decided the fire was actually a hoax,
apparently an attempt to head off any U.S. military action against
the plant. The photos reportedly showed that burn marks were
painted on the building.
   Diplomats said a Western European embassy employee who visited
Rabta this week reported the building was still standing but
appeared abandoned. Roadblocks near Rabta and missiles around it
had been removed, according to the report, which could not be
independently verified.
   Libya's version of the story changed in the opposite direction.
Libya first told diplomats that the blaze had caused little damage.
But later, it reported there had been a ``huge fire,'' and said it
suspected the United States, Britain or West Germany of
responsibility.
   The official Libyan news agency JANA said Wednesday that two
West Germans were being interrogated about the blaze.
   A West Germany foreign ministry spokesman confirmed two
employees of a German company that helped build the Rabta plant
have been held by the Libyans since March 25.

   El Salvador's promise to push for a trial in
the murder of six Jesuits priests is encouraging, the Bush
administration said Wednesday.
   However, Assistant Secretary of State Bernard Aronson said the
United States would closely watch how San Salvador responds to a
congressional report that strongly criticized its investigation.
   ``There's a sense that (the investigation) has gotten stalled,''
Aronson said. ``The report raises serious questions that need to be
addressed.''
   A Salvadoran colonel and eight other military personnel have
been charged in the Nov. 16 killing of the six priests in the
Salvadoran capital.
   El Salvador said Tuesday that President Alfredo Cristiani hopes
the case will go to trial within 90 days. The action comes in the
face of growing criticism on Capitol Hill, where a new aid package
for El Salvador is being considered.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III will send the
congressional report to Cristiani, Aronson said, adding that Baker
has ``made it clear that the resolution of this case will be one
important element in determining the nature of future U.S.
assistance.''
   The Bush administration wants $375 million for El Salvador next
year, including $90 million in military assistance.
   House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., appointed 19 members of
Congress under the chairmanship of Rep. Joe Moakley, D-Mass., to
examine the Salvadoran investigation.
   Aronson said El Salvador's statement about the case was ``a good
step forward, but the questions that the Moakley report raised
ought to be addressed.'' He also said the Salvadoran government
announced it would question officers that the congressional report
said should be interviewed.
   The report said Salvadoran officials, inclding the judge in the
case, appear reluctant to ask questions or follow leads that appear
to implicate high ranking military personnel.
   Baker told Congress on Tuesday that he would be open to a new
bipartisan policy toward El Salvador that could include conditions
on future aid. Such conditions might relate to the investigation in
the Jesuit murder case and progress on United Nations-sponsored
peace talks.
   With those talks still pending, the leftist rebels Tuesday
launched a ferocious attack in San Salvador, cutting power to much
of the city.
   Aronson said ``those attacks fly in the face and give the lie to
(the rebel's) professed desire to negotiate.''

<HEAD>Angry Judge Stiffens Fines For Underage Drinking and Loud Parties</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF MEYER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   FARGO, N.D. _ After watching hours of raucus drinking and
swearing at a party near his daughter's house, a judge tripled his
fines for underage drinkers in an effort to ``take back the streets
from the nightcrawlers.''
   One attorney said Judge Thomas Davies' new policy ``smacks of
age discrimination,'' but the judge called such talk ``absolute
nonsense.''
   Davies said that by raising the fines for minors in possession
of alcohol and for violations of Fargo's loud party ordinance, he
hopes to prevent young people from developing serious problems with
alcohol when they are older.
   ``I decided somebody's got to do something,'' Davies said.
``Maybe if these kids start thinking of the beer they're holding in
their hand as costing $300, they'll think twice about drinking it.''
   Davies, 51, who has a reputation for being tough on young
drinkers, said he watched for two hours Saturday night while high
school and college men and women wreaked havoc in his daughter's
neighborhood.
   The revelers were drinking, swearing loudly, running through
people's yards and berating neighbors for calling the police, he
said.
   ``When the party was done, I thought, `This is Fargo, N.D.?' I
thought I knew my city. I thought I knew the kids,'' said Davies.
   The judge said he is responding by increasing the fine in his
court for possession of alcohol by minors from $100 to $300 and the
fine for noise violations from $350 to $500 _ the maximum fine
allowed under city law. North Dakota's legal drinking age is 21.
   ``I want people in this city to know that there are people out
there who do care, who want to take the streets back from the
nightcrawlers,'' he said.
   Attorneys who have appeared before Davies declined to comment on
the move, but they describe the judge as ``very strict'' on
underage drinking and possession charges.
   Dwight Kautzmann, former president of the state Bar Association,
said the stricter fines may provoke charges of age discrimination.
   ``I think the good judge might want to reconsider his
position,'' he said.
   But Davies said he doesn't worry about how others view his
sentences.
   ``I don't take an opinion poll on how they might be received by
the public,'' he said. ``I basically operate from the gut.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) An international group of legislators called for
immediate action to curb ``greenhouse'' pollutants Wednesday and
recommended a ``global Marshall Plan'' to help developing countries
cope with environmental problems.
   Concluding a three-day environment conference, the delegates
from 42 countries urged nations to commit without delay to cutting
the pollution that causes global warming by 50 percent over the
next 20 years.
   The actions by the Interparliamentary Conference on the Global
Environment are little more than suggestions for an environmental
game plan and are not binding on any country. But many of the
delegates to the conference, hosted by the U.S. Congress, said they
would return home to push for legislative action along the lines
outlined.
   The aggressive strategies on global warming contrasted to the
approach favored by President Bush and senior White House
officials. Bush two weeks ago told an international White House
Conference on the environment that more research was needed before
any commitments are made for specific pollution controls.
   More than 200 lawmakers from 42 nations, including the Soviet
Union, most European countries, Japan and many developing nations,
were participating in the conference.
   While participants promised to work on behalf of some of the
conference goals and recommendations, few suggested the effort
would produce new laws anytime soon.
   ``This conference has given us an agenda for action,'' said
James Miruka Owuor, a conference co-chairman from Kenya.
   ``I think this is a message to the executive branch here in the
United States'' and in other countries as well, said Sen. Albert
Gore, D-Tenn., the conference chairman. ``For any prime minister or
president who says delay, we are saying ... the time is now to
act.''
   Gore did not name President Bush, but told a news conference
that the three-day sessions ``stand in very sharp contrast'' to the
White House conference on global warming two weeks earlier.
   ``We have come to a consensus agreement that the need for action
is now, that the need for action is urgent,'' said Gore, who in the
past has chided the Bush administration for failing to exert
leadership on dealing with the ``greenhouse'' issue.
   The gathering agreed on a broad range of environmental goals,
including actions aimed at protecting the ozone layer, reversing
the loss of forests and committing greater resources to population
control.
   The policy statements, however, provided few specifics on how
some of these efforts would be paid for, including the proposed
plan by industrial nations to help developing countries.
   This so-called ``global Marshall plan for sustainable
development and the environment'' would be patterned on the
post-World War II economic assistance efforts by the United States
that helped Europe recover from the war, officials said.
   On global warming, the conference declared, ``The time to act is
now. Delay exposes us, our children and their children to
calamities which we will have made irrevocable by inaction in the
present.''
   In contrast to the recent international White House conference,
the legislative delegates in their policy recommendations scarcely
touched on the need for more research.
   Instead, the delegates called for setting a timetable for
secific cuts in global warming pollutants by the year 2010,
including a 20 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, a
product of burning fossil fuels; elimination of
chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, and a variety of other
ozone-depleting chemicals; and a 10 percent reduction in methane
emissions.
   Altogether, that would amount to about a 50 percent reduction in
global-warming pollutants by 2010, conference organizers said.

   Organ donation efforts are hampered by
physicians and hospital officials who decline to act on a patient's
wish to be a donor until they have the family's consent, said a
report released Wednesday.
   ``Even though a person wishes to donate, he or she may not do so
after death unless his next-of-kin can be located and agree to the
donation,'' said the report produced by a conference of 130
physicians, scientists and other medical and media experts.
   ``An individual's decision to donate should in every case be
respected,'' the conference report said.
   The report noted that after years of increases in organ donors,
the number has leveled off in recent years and dipped slightly in
1989 to 3,993 from 4,069 the year before. Each donor gives an
average of three organs.
   Last year, 13,290 transplants were performed, about 5 percent
more than the 12,669 done in 1988, according to the United Network
for Organ Sharing, which contracts with the federal government to
run a national organ distribution network and registry.
   Currently, 20,466 potential organ transplant patients are on the
UNOS waiting list.
   For every 40 Americans who die, one donates an organ or tissue,
according to Joel Swerdlow, a conference a public policy analyst at
the Annenberg Washington Program in Communications Policy Studies,
which is part of Northwestern University.
   If a patient has expressed a wish in the form of a donor card to
give their organs after they die, physicians can act legally on
that wish, Swerdlow said. But physicians and hospital officials are
reluctant, fearing that family members might be upset and stir bad
publicity for the hospital, he said.
   The conference report also recommended that a nationwide bone
marrow donation network be created and that the existing organ
donation networks be consolidated and coordinated into a single
network.
   The existing organ donation system, which is carried out through
several different networks and transplant centers, matches
available organs with patients in need.
   ``We do that well, but we have to do that better,'' said Dr.
Gary Friedlaender, chief of orthopedics and rehabilitation at Yale
New Haven Hospital in Connecticut.
   The conference report also recommended better efforts to educate
the public and health care professionals about the need for organ
donors.
   The conference was sponsored by the Annenberg Center for Health
Sciences, which is part of Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho
Mirage, Calif., the American Medical Association and the Annenberg
Washington Program.

   Alexander the Great got a posthumous addition
to his empire Wednesday courtesy of George Bush.
   It came as the president was talking up his ``points of light''
initiaive to a group of 175 youths from the Washington area.
   Bush was extolling some of history's early achievers.
   ``By the age of 32, Alexander the Great's empire stretched from
Indiana _'' said Bush, who caught his own gaffe and broke into
laughter.
   ``Indiana? It included Indiana,'' he laughed, then corrected
himself, ``From India to the Adriatic.''
   ``Youth is no barrier to great achievements,'' Bush told the
first Presidential Youth Leadership Forum, intended to encourage
all young Americans to involve themselves in community service.
   Bush also pointed out that Joan of Arc was only 16 when she
began her quest to drive the English from France, and Mozart had
composed 250 pieces by the time he was 20.
   As a sendoff, Bush watched Riakos L. Adams, student body
president of Banneker High School, use hand signals to lead the
crowd through a chorus of sighs and grunts.
   ``He might be the next Mozart, but I don't know what the hell
he's saying,'' quipped Bush.

<HEAD>Yeutter Says Boosting Farm Program Benefits Not in Cards</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said
Wednesday that advocates of congressional bills to boost farm
program benefits ignore budget realities.
   ``Maybe these big high numbers make good campaign material back
home, but the day of reckoning is coming,'' he said.
   A number of 1990 farm bill measures have been approved or are
under consideration by subcommittees that exceed limits set by
Capitol Hill and Bush administration budget cutters.
   Recent examples include action to sweeten programs for sugar,
cotton and rice. Other commodities, including soybeans, wheat and
feed grains, would be affected by supports or payments being tied
to production costs.
   Yeutter said these proposals will be eliminated or watered down
by the full agricultural committees, during floor debate or in
meetings to settle differences between the House and Senate
versions.
   The subcommittees are ``living in a dream world'' and will have
to be pulled back to reality by pressures on federal spending, he
said.
   Yeutter mentioned ``two-tier'' dairy price support proposals,
which he said would contradict U.S. objectives to liberalize world
trade through the ongoing Uruguay Round of negotiations.
   Yeutter also told a meeting of American Farm Bureau Federation
leaders that he is ``not going to back off at all'' on the
administration's proposal for more flexibility in the 1990 farm
bill.
   The administration wants the measure, which will be a blueprint
for U.S. farm policy over the next five years, to allow farmers
more leeway in deciding the mix of crops they plant on their base
acreages.
   ``I don't know of a single farmer who wouldn't like to have more
flexibility in his operation,'' Yeutter said.
   The issue of federal crop insurance and disaster aid represents
``a tremendous dilemma'' for lawmakers and the administration, he
said. Federal crop insurance has not been a successful program, and
emergency disaster aid for drought and other weather problems has
been a costly alternative in recent years.
   Thus, Yeutter said, the administration has recommended Congress
switch to some kind of permanent disaster program. There is no
clearly visible way to repair crop insurance without huge costs, he
said.
   Yeutter said that if Congress insists on saving crop insurance,
the money might have to come from reducing target prices for major
crops. Those are used to calculate income subsidies, or deficiency
payments, to farmers when market prices are low.

   A Bush administration plan to link federal
employees' pay to performance would provide extra compensation for
workers who live in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco,
officials said Wednesday.
   The proposal also would let the government ignore salary caps
for hiring 400 ``world class'' experts for such fields as nuclear
safety and medical research.
   ``We're having trouble recruiting and retaining people to run
this government,'' Constance Newman, director of the Office of
Personnel Management, said in releasing the administration's pay
proposal, which would affect about 1.4 million white-collar workers.
   Similar pay-for-performance proposals have been rejected by
Congress in the past, but Ms. Newman said lawmakers were beginning
to realize the government's inability to compete with private
industry.
   The administration's plan was introduced in both the House and
the Senate this week.
   Last month, unions that represent government employees
criticized the proposal, saying government pay cannot be reformed
without additional money.
   The OPM's plan, which provides an additional $1.5 billion for
the 1991 fiscal year, would award federal employee pay raises based
on performance rather than tenure.
   In addition, the OPM, which handles personnel matters for the
federal bureaucracy, is asking for congressional authority to
eliminate the system that awards pay increases every year.
   The administration's plan, which makes dozens of changes that
would not become fully effective until 1995, calls for providing
geographic differentials to employees in certain cities where the
federal government has the most trouble competing with private
industry.
   The plan would eventually provide differentials of up to 25
percent above the worker's base salary level in cities with high
labor costs and area-wide staffing problems.
   Though all of the cities that would fall under the geographic
differential category haven't been determined, the plan calls for
immediately providing 8 percent pay boosts to workers in New York,
Los Angeles and San Francisco.
   Other high-cost cities such as Washington, D.C., and Boston
might also be included if studies showed the differential was
needed for recruitment, Ms. Newman said.
   The legislation would let the government pay as much as it
wanted for experts in highly competitive fields such as medical or
scientific research, Ms. Newman said. The cap on such pay now is
$78,200.

<HEAD>Visiting West German Head of State Assures Poland on Border</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DRUSILLA MENAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer_</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West German President Richard von
Weizsaecker reiterated Wednesday that Poland's western border is
inviolable and said an agreement will be reached guaranteeing its
permanence.
   ``We agree on the course we have to chart,'' he said. ``We want
to bring settlement about and we will bring it about.''
   Weizsaecker, the first West German head of state to visit
Poland, began his four-day visit by meeting President Wojciech
Jaruzelski and Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki. Weizsaecker's
agenda also includes meetings with Solidarity leader Lech Walesa
and Roman Catholic Primate Jozef Glemp, among others.
   He also will visit the former Nazi death camp at Treblinka, and
Gdansk, the former Free City of Danzig, where the German army
shelled the small Polish garrison to begin World War II.
   Weizaecker told Polish television, ``We cannot assess the modern
times without preserving memories.
   ``I think that youth should have their share in the painful
awareness that the Germans were the ones who had brought war,
occupation and lawlessness to Poland, that they had done harm to
many millions of Poles even though they bear no personal
responsibility for that.''
   With Weizsaecker was Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher,
who met with Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski to discuss a
treaty to be signed by a united Germany establishing the permanence
of Poland's postwar western border.
   A representative of the East German Foreign Ministry will join
talks on the treaty Thursday, the Polish news agency PAP reported.
   ``We have difficult years and difficult months behind us. ...
The substance of the matter has been clarified,'' Weizsaecker said.
   His trip comes as Poland seeks security guarantees before the
two Germanys unify, and it marks a new stage in the centuries of
complex, often bloody relations between the neighboring nations.
   West Germany is Poland's largest Western trading partner, and
its support is critical to the success of economic and political
reforms undertaken by the new, non-communist government.
   But with an older generation that recalls the devastating World
War II invasion and occupation, Poland harbors feelings of
bitterness and distrust toward Germany. In the rush toward
unification, embraced by powers worldwide, Poland has raised its
concerns.
   Weizsaecker said, ``Against the backdrop of recent developments,
we can all agree on ... how much depends on German-Polish
relations, not only for our two nations but for the whole of Europe.
   ``We are all aware there are still problems of a psychological
and material nature to overcome.''
   Poland wants a seat at unification talks to guarantee its
postwar western border, and wants a treaty with the two Germanys
and the new government of a united Germany making it permanent.
   Drawn along the Oder and Neisse rivers, the boundary
incorporates into Poland 40,000 square miles of land from the
defeated Germany. The territory was to compensate Poland for a
larger section annexed by the Soviet Union.
   Leaders in both Germanys offered promises concerning the border.
This week, Poland submitted a draft treaty to the two Germanys and
the four victorious World War II allies _ the United States, Soviet
Union, Britian and France _ which will meet Saturday in Bonn to lay
groundwork for unification talks.
   ``The border as it is today ... will be inviolable,''
Weizsaecker said in Warsaw.
   The president said Germany and Poland share a mutual interest in
ensuring reform and avoiding instability in the Soviet Union.
   ``This German inspires confidence,'' read a headline in
Wednesday's pro-Solidarity newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza, over a
profile outlining Weizsaecker's long support for Poland's border
concerns.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl, head of the West German government,
visited Poland last November.

<HEAD>CDC: Report That One in Four NYC Men Infected Incorrect</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   News reports suggesting that one in four younger
men in New York is AIDS-infected are incorrect, the Centers for
Disease Control said Wednesday.
   The publication Medical Tribune sparked a flurry of news stories
with a report this week that ``in the New York City-New Jersey
region, one in four men aged 25-44 is seropositive for AIDS.''
Other news reports said the figure applied to males 25-44 in New
York City itself.
   Dr. James Curran, director of the CDC's Division of HIV and
AIDS, said the news reports were triggered when a CDC AIDS
researcher told a medical conference in Baltimore that a single
hospital in the New York-New Jersey area had reported a 24 percent
infection rate among men 25-44.
   ``That data is from one hospital,'' Curran said, adding that the
rate was different at another participating hospital in the New
York-New Jersey area and a third has yet to complete its reporting.
   ``It's correct for the prevalence at that one hospital,'' Curran
said, but he added, ``A single hospital cannot be extrapolated to a
city, particularly one of 8 million people.''
   The CDC, in tracking AIDS trends across the nation, is
conducting a study of AIDS infection rates at more than 40
hospitals nationwide to gauge infection rates among patients who
come to the hospital with non-AIDS complaints.
   Editors at Medical Tribune said they are standing by their
report, which cited findings as presented by the CDC researcher,
Dr. Tim Dondero.
   Dondero was not available for comment Wednesday; he is currently
in China, Curran said.
   CDC officials said the study of infection rates at various
hospitals is continuing and results are expected to be compiled and
released later this year.
   By their very nature, hospitals are a good place to examine the
results of blood testing, Curran said. The CDC also is monitoring
infection rates among groups including military personnel, prison
inmates and even American Indians.
   ``It's meant to give us a broad look at HIV infection,'' he
said. ``But there are wide variations of HIV infection.''
   The CDC has yet to release findings from the hospital survey,
and CDC officials would not identify the New York-New Jersey
hospital with the high infection rate.
   Curran said even though the hospital survey findings should not
be projected to the general population, ``we don't want to say it's
not an important problem.

   A portrait of Benjamin Franklin, stolen from the
Boston Public Library last month, has been recovered by the FBI.
   The painting, valued at $50,000, was returned through an
intermediary, who said the man who took it did so as a prank,
according to the FBI.
   The man is negotiating through an attorney for immunity from
charges in exchange for returning the painting. His identity has
not been disclosed to the FBI, the agency said.
   The portrait, painted by Joseph-Siffred Duplessis, was a gift to
Boston in 1858. The artist painted the picture in Paris when
Franklin, the U.S. ambassador to France, was 70.
   The painting was reported stolen April 13 after a library
official noticed it was missing from its frame.

<HEAD>Bush Honors Disabled American Of The Year</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Wednesday honored the 1990
Disabled American of the Year and plugged legislation to guaranteed
civil rights for the handicapped because ``disabled citizens have
waited long enough for equality.''
   Bush presented the President's Trophy to David Schwartzkopf of
Rochester, Minn., a high technology professional who has cerebral
palsy and is legally blind.
   In remarks to the annual conference of the President's Committee
on Employment of People With Disabilities, Bush called for speedy
House action on the pending Americans With Disabilities Act which
has been hailed as the most significant piece of civil rights
legislation since the 1964 Civil Rights Act banned discrimination
based on race, color, national origin, sex and religion.
   The bill guarantees access to transportation, telephone systems
and businesses, professional services and employment. It would, for
instance, make it unlawful to deny a job or a service to someone on
the basis of that person's disability or perceived disability.
   ``No longer can we allow ignorance or prejudice to deny
opportunities to millions of Americans with disabilities,'' Bush
said. ``We welcome you the disabled into the mainstream of American
life because it is your life as well as ours.''
   More than two-thirds of the disabled Americans of working age
are unemployed, Bush said, calling that statistic ``intolerable.''
   ``Much of that unemployment stems from lack of opportunity,'' he
said.
   ``Every American should be able to join the work force to the
fullest extent of their abilities,'' he said. ``I look forward to
signing a bill that will address the needs of our disabled
citizens. And frankly, it is my view that disabled citizens have
waited long enough for equality.''
   The disabilities legislation, protecting all kinds of
handicapped including AIDS victims, enjoys wide support in
Congress, but Republicans have sought to change the pending House
version as business interests, stew about sanctions that would
imposed on employers found guilty of discrimination. The Senate
passed its version last year.
   The president's committee on the disabled is a small government
agency that focuses on developing employment opportunities.
   Schwartzkopf, the disabled American of the year, is program
manager with IBM in Rochester, currently working for the state jobs
department as assistant commission of rehabilitation services.

   The Latvian Popular Front on Wednesday
unveiled an independence plan that it hopes would bring the Baltic
republic freedom within years without incurring Moscow's wrath.
   Deputies from the Popular Front told an evening news conference
they believed they had enough votes to get the draft measure passed
in a session of Latvia's Supreme Soviet parliament that opens
Thursday.
   The Popular Front plan would declare independence as a gesture
but actual independence would occur only after an unspecified
transition period that deputies estimated would last several years.
   Estonia, like Lithuania an independence-minded Baltic neighbor,
passed a similar measure March 30.
   Popular Front deputies said they agreed to the measure after
watching Lithuania declare independence March 11 and then struggle
unsuccessfully to persuade Moscow to begin negotiations.
   ``We didn't slam the door and then start to knock,'' said Romans
Apsitis, a law professor. ``We're leaving the door open and still
moving toward independence.''
   Latvian President Anatoly Gorbunov, expected to be re-elected
Thursday, said the proposal took into account talks that already
have begun with Moscow.
   The session also will vote on dropping the ``Soviet Socialist''
from Latvia's name, leaving it simply ``The Republic of Latvia,''
said Deputy Janis Krumins.
   The Popular Front proposal would leave most of the republic's
Soviet-era constitution intact, but it would also assert Latvia's
claim to independence on its historic territory and its right to
re-establish its traditional parliament.
   Despite the conciliatory tone of the Latvian proposal, deputies
said they were against following the guidelines for secession laid
down in a Soviet law passed in April that makes it difficult for a
republic to leave the union.
   Apsitis said at most Latvia would consider a role in a
reconfigured Soviet confederation _ but only after gaining
independence.
   Unlike Lithuania, where native Lithuanians make up 80 percent of
the population, native Latvians make up about 54 percent of
Latvia's 2.7 million residents. The rest are largely Russians who
frown on secession.
   Despite their ethnic disadvantage, Latvian nationalists have
been pushing full force for the parliament to emulate Lithuania.
   Of the 199 members of Latvia's new Supreme Soviet elected in
March, 131 are popular front supporters and several more are
sympathizers, a deputy said. They need 133 votes for the required
two-thirds majority to pass the independence measure.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev recently warned Latvian
delegates that he would offer the republic special status in a
reconfigured federation but he would not accept Lithuanian-style
outright secession.
   In the past year, Latvia has copied Lithuania's daring political
moves. In December, it abolished the Communist Party's guarantee on
power; in February it condemned the 1940 act that formalized its
annexation by the Soviet Union; and last month a large segment of
its Communist Party broke off from its Moscow-based parent party.
All the moves came within months, sometimes weeks, of similar
Lithuanian actions.
   Latvian activists have also created a shadow parliament to
represent mainly native Latvians.
   The Latvian Citizens' Congress, representing 700,000 pre-1940
residents and their children, convened Monday and Tuesday to demand
restoration of the independence the republic lost in 1940 when
Latvia was forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union along with
Lithuania and Estonia.
   The congress claims the right to replace the Supreme Soviet
during the transition to independence. If the parliament votes
against independence, the congress plans to set itself up as an
``alternative authority,'' Tass said.
   A poll published Monday by the Soviet newspaper Izvestia said 92
percent of ethnic Latvians surveyed favor secession. Of the
non-Latvian residents of the republic, 45 percent were for
independence, said the poll. It did not specify its sample size or
margin of error.

   Here are some main points of the agreement
Wednesday between the two German states on monetary union:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   DATE _ Monetary union, a major step toward unification, will
become effective July 2. Until then and effective at once, the
official exchange rate for West Germans and foreigners going to
East Germany will be two East German marks for one West German
mark, instead of the 3-1 rate in force previously.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   IMPACT _ West Germany's powerful currency will replace East
Germany's mark, which is virtually worthless outside East Germany.
This will give East Germans opportunity to travel widely and buy
Western consumer goods. But it is expected to cause wide
unemployment as East German companies are forced to close as demand
for their products drops.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   SAVINGS _ East Germany pushed for a 1-1 rate of conversion for
savings, but not all savings will be converted at that rate. East
Germans aged 14 and under will be able to convert up to 2,000 marks
at 1-1. Those aged 15 to 59 will be able to convert 4,000 marks at
1-1, and people 60 and older, up to 6,000 marks. All other savings
will be converted at two East German marks for one West German mark.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   SALARIES _ Salaries will be converted at a 1-1 rate.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   PENSIONS _ East German pensions will be brought to the West
German levels, meaning most of them will be raised.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   RENTS _ Also to be converted at 1-1 rate.

   DEBTS _ To be converted at a 2-1 rate, more favorable to
troubled East German companies.

<TEXT>
   The Navy is basing its aircraft purchase plans
on the assumption it will have 14 carrier battle groups, even
though Defense Secretary Dick Cheney says fewer are likely, a top
officer told Congress Wednesday.
   ``Right now the guidance is 14 carrier battle groups,'' Vice
Adm. Richard Dunleavy, assistant chief of naval operations, told a
Senate Armed Services subcommittee.
   In announcing cuts in Pentagon plans to buy the B-2 stealth
bomber and other sophisticated aircraft, Cheney recommended
purchasing a smaller number of the Navy's A-12 all-weather medium
attack planes _ a minimum of 620 instead of the original request of
858.
   The cuts could mean elimination of two of the Navy's 14 aircraft
carrier battle groups, Cheney said.
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., chairman of the subcommittee on
conventional forces and alliance defense, questioned Dunleavy on
whether the Navy's acquisition plans for the A-12 and other
aircraft is predicated on 14 or 12 carrier battle groups.
   ``Presumption of 14,'' Dunleavy responded.
   Fewer battle groups would limit the service's ability ``to be
there and do exactly what you want at a moment's notice.''
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, has suggested 10 or 12 carriers is appropriate. ``Below
12, you're becoming a very hollow force,'' Dunleavy said.
   A battle group consists of a carrier plus the escorting
warships, usually four or five, without which it cannot fight.
   Cheney's plan to delay purchases of the Advanced Tactical
Fighter may force the Navy to request additional production of the
F-14D jet fighter, Dunleavy said.
   The F-14D, built by Grumman Corp., was a major point of
contention between Congress and the Bush administration last year.
Cheney proposed canceling it; Congress decided to buy 18 planes
while requiring the manufacturer to sign a termination contract.
   ``We may come back to Congress and suggest reconsideration of
new manufacture of F-14D to make it last until the follow-on
fighter comes on,'' Dunleavy said.
   But if Cheney decides to reduce the carrier battle groups,
additional F-14D fighters may be unnecessary, he said.

   Former U.S. hostage Frank Reed
revealed Wednesday he was held for months with two other American
captives in Lebanon and said he was angry and embarrassed that they
have not been freed.
   Reed, who was released Monday after 42 months in captivity, said
he also was held with two British hostages. Reed was flown Tuesday
to Wiesbaden for a battery of medical exams and questioning at the
U.S. Air Force hospital.
   ``I have not seen Tom and Terry for a while and I don't know
where they are,'' Reed said, referring to Terry Anderson, The
Associated Press chief Middle East correspondent, and Thomas
Sutherland, an American educator.
   ``For God's sake, it's nearly the sixth year for these men. I'm
absolutely embarrassed I'm out before they are.''
   Reed, in his first comments to reporters since arriving in
Wiesbaden, said he spent ``the good part of two years with Tom and
Terry.''
   Anderson, the longest-held Western hostage in Lebanon, was
kidnapped on March 16, 1985. Sutherland was seized June 9, 1985.
   ``I tell you, I'm very, very angry that Anderson ... Tom and
Terry ... are not free,'' Reed said from the hospital balcony.
   Reed, pale and dressed in his blue hospital bathrobe, said he
last saw Sutherland in February 1989. Sutherland on Thursday turns
59, marking his fifth birthday in captivity.
   Reed, 57, also said he spent three years in the intermittent
company of Briton John McCarthy and Brian Keenan, a dual
Anglo-Irish citizen. He said he saw them just before his release
and they were ``well and alive.''
   ``I have been with John and Brian since last October,'' Reed
said. ``I've spent almost three years either with John and Brian or
having them somewhere in the house with me.''
   McCarthy, 33, a journalist for the London-based Worldwide
Television News agency, WTN, was kidnapped April 17, 1986. Keenan,
39, disappeared while walking to work six days later.
   ``Those were the only people I knew'' in captivity, Reed said of
the four hostages.
   The founder of a private school in Beirut, Reed was the second
American hostage freed in nine days. Robert Polhill, freed April
22, went through the same medical tests and debriefing last week.
   A special State Department team questioned Reed for a second day
Wednesday, seeking clues about the 16 remaining Westerners held
hostage by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon. Six of the captives are
American.
   President Bush thanked Syria and Iran for aiding both hostages'
release but has said he will make no deals for hostages. Both Syria
and Iran hope to establish closer ties with the West.
   But on Wednesday, Iran's spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei
ruled out negotiations with the United States to end 11 years of
hostility between the nations. It was not known what the
anti-American stance meant for the possibility of any further
hostage releases.
   Reed, who lost 60 pounds in his 3{ years of captivity said he
initially had been angry with the U.S. administration that hostages
were still being held.
   ``But I don't think I am now,'' he said. ``On the basis of
information I have received ... it appears to me perhaps we are on
the right track to getting these people out.''
   Speaking earlier in the day, Reed's Syrian-born wife, Fahima,
said that while in captivity her husband was kept blindfolded and
bound for most of the time. For about 90 minutes during the
evenings he was allowed to watch television or read magazines or
books but he refused, she said.
   ``These things were so trivial compared to the things that were
snatched away,'' Mrs. Reed said.
   The boisterous, lanky Reed was cheered by dozens of journalists
as he appeared on the balcony for what was supposed to be a
no-questions photo opportunity.
   But Reed, in a jocular mood, readily fielded reporters'
questions.
   Standing on the balcony with his wife and their 9-year-old son,
Tarek, Reed smiled and affectionately tousled his child's hair,
saying it was ``just great'' to be reunited with his family.
   Reed said he was ``feeling good'' but tired.
   ``I'd like to stay another week or two, but they want me out of
here on Friday,'' he joked.
   Asked what he wanted to do when he gets back to his home in
Massachusetts, Reed said: ``Hide,'' but then rethought the
question, and said: ``I'd like to have a big Maine lobster, about
three pounds.''
   Reed has taken advantage of his new-found freedom to telephone
the kin of other hostages to relay what he knows about their
condition.
   Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, said Reed told her: ``Terry was in
reasonably good health, although he had been having physical
problems. ... He said Terry's attitude was still feisty, as far as
the guards go, and he was always screaming for something to read.''
   In London, a group pressing for release of McCarthy said Reed
telephoned the hostage's father to say both Keenan and McCarthy are
well: ``They have some minor health problems. They exercise daily
and read voraciously.''

<HEAD>More Deadly Floods In Texas; Snow In Southern Rockies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>

   Showers and thunderstorms extended from New Mexico to Kentucky
on Wednesday, producing flooding that killed three people in Texas,
and snow continued falling in the southern Rockies.
   Temperatures hit record highs in the Southeast, but a record low
was reported in Minnesota.
   Showers and thunderstorms continued into the afternoon,
extending from New Mexico across northern and central Texas,
Oklahoma, Arkansas, northwestern Mississippi, western and central
Tennessee into Kentucky, the National Weather Service said.
   Heavy rain in north-central Texas flooded streets and highways
and forced the evacuations of dozens of people from homes in
low-lying areas, authorities said.
   Some areas had up to 7 inches of rain in 24 hours.
   Downtown Gainsville, about 40 miles north of Dallas, was
completely closed due to flooding. Authorities in Fort Worth
evacuated more than 70 people from three mobile home parks and
other residences. Seventy-six people were taken to shelters in Fort
Worth.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included
1.62 inches at Abilene, Texas; 1.59 inches at Altus, Okla.; 1.32
inches at Oklahoma City; and 1.28 inches at Tulsa, Okla.
   Snow continued falling Wednesday over the mountains of southern
Colorado, but it was expected to end during the night. Snow also
fell at higher elevations of north-central New Mexico.
   Temperatures hit record highs in the Southeast, including 94 at
Augusta, Ga.; 95 at Charleston, S.C.; and 95 at Savannah, Ga.
   But in Minnesota, Rochester hit a record low for the date at 26
degrees.
   Wednesday's low for the Lower 48 states was 19 at Laramie, Wyo.
   Frost and freezing temperatures were expected during the night
in sections of eastern New York state and Vermont.
   Elsewhere, showers extended over western Montana and from
northwestern Oregon along the Washington coast.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 34 at
Las Vegas, N.M., to 100 at Fort Stewart, Ga.

   President Bush's summit meeting with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will be held in Washington but may
conclude with a private get-together elsewhere, the White House
said Wednesday.
   Bush and Gorbachev are to meet May 30-June 3 in their second
summit in six months.
   There has been speculation the president would take Gorbachev to
the Bush vacation home in Kennebunkport, Maine, or that their talks
would be held at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland's
Catoctin Mountains.
   ``We've said the main meetings would be here in Washington, but
there might be a private day at the end. And that's still the
case,'' said White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   There is a strong possibility that a NATO summit will be held
after the talks so Bush can report to the allies about the meeting,
Fitzwater said.

   Violent thunderstorms roared across northern Texas
for the second time in two weeks Wednesday, flooding roads, forcing
scores to evacuate and killing three people.
   Some areas got up to 7 inches of rain in 24 hours. Forecasters
said the heavy rain and flooding would continue through Thursday
morning.
   The deaths bring this spring's death toll from heavy rain and
flooding in north-central Texas to nine; five people were killed by
flooding last week and another died in mid-April. Last year, 22
people died in flooding and strong thunderstorms in the area.
   The storms snarled traffic throughout the Dallas-Fort Worth area
late Tuesday and early Wednesday. Numerous roads were closed and
rescue workers and wreckers were used to haul people out of cars
that became stranded in deep water.
   Seventy-six people were taken to shelters in Fort Worth.
Downtown Gainsville, about 40 miles north of Dallas, was completely
closed by flooding.
   Also in Gainsville, 36 elderly people were evacuated from the
Turner Hotel, a five-story apartment complex, when electricity went
out as the basement flooded. They were taken to a Red Cross
shelter, said volunteer Nona Sluder.
   Authorities in Fort Worth evacuated more than 70 people from
three mobile home parks and other residences.
   The Army Corps of Engineers monitored the rise of Lake Texoma at
the Texas-Oklahoma border, which had climbed above 639 feet _ a
foot below the overflow mark.
   Mike McCoy, a park manager, said engineers expected the lake to
rise into spillways sometime during the night for only the second
time since the dam was built, and crest at 641 feet on Thursday.
   In Abilene, the National Weather Service reported a rainfall
total of 3.16 inches by Wednesday afternoon. Abilene school
officials closed schools as a precaution.
   Residents of the Horseshoe Bend area along the Brazos River
repeated emergency drills they became familiar with last week, said
Mike Pascal, Parker County Fire Marshal. Pascal said the
evacuations went smoothly Wednesday.
   Nearly 1,000 people were evacuated from Horseshoe Bend because
of serious flooding last week. But authorities evacuated fewer than
400 Wednesday, Pascal said.
   Two men died early Wednesday when flash flooding swept through
Fort Worth. Both were swept away when they apparently left a
vehicle after trying to drive across a flooded creek, said Police
Sgt. Jon Grady. Their bodies were found two miles downstream.
   ``Any of those creeks are normally dry but the level is way up
now so any sweeping water is something to stay away from,'' said
Police Capt. Greg Givens.
   A fire captain was swept downstream while trying to rescue the
men. But he managed to grab a tree and was later rescued, Deputy
Fire Chief K.D. Laymance said.
   Elsewhere in Fort Worth, street department workers found the
body of a missing woman late Wednesday at a park.

<HEAD>Taiwan's Defense Minister Named Prime Minister</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNIE HUANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Lee Teng-hui tapped his defense
minister to become Taiwan's new prime minister in a surprise move
Wednesday that was greeted with hostility and suspicion by the
opposition.
   Lawmaker Chen Shui-pien of the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party denounced Lee's choice of Hau Pei-tsun, the country's only
four-star general, as ``a move to drive Taiwan's democracy
backward.''
   Lee is expected to formally announce the appointment May 20,
when he is sworn in for a new six-year term as president. The
Legislature will have to approve Hau's nomination.
   Hau, 71, belongs to the old guard of the governing Nationalist
Party that fled to Taiwan with Chiang Kai-shek in 1949 after losing
a civil war to communist forces on mainland China. He is among the
Nationalist conservatives who still dream of returning to China to
overthrow the communists.
   Hau said he accepted the offer to lead the government at a
meeting with the president Wednesday. He would replace Lee Huan,
73, in about two weeks.
   The general said in an interview with Taiwan's three TV
stations, ``President Lee said the country needs me. I thought I
should not defy him.''
   Hau would be the first general to become prime minister in 27
years. He was appointed defense minister last year after being
chief of the 500,000-member armed forces for eight years.
   He said his selection does not mean the military would interfere
in politics _ ``There are many such precedents in democratic
countries.''
   But opposition leader Jiang Peng-chien called the appointment
``odd and inappropriate ... an apparent compromise with the
military.''
   Jiang said he feared ``the military would interfere more in
politics. The military has mistaken our society's newly emerged
pluralism as social chaos and wants to stamp out opposition
voices.''
   In recent years, the Nationalists have gradually loosened their
tight reins here _ lifting martial law, allowing opposition
political parties and giving more government posts to the native
Taiwanese, who account for 85 percent of the island's 20 million
people.
   The selection of Hau stirred political speculation about its
possible impact on the easing of restrictions on contacts with
mainland China, which has resulted in hundreds of thousands of
Taiwan residents traveling there.

<HEAD>Paroled `Onion Field' Killer Jimmy Lee Smith Arrested for Assault</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Paroled ``Onion Field'' police killer Jimmy
Lee Smith was arrested for allegedly threatening a man with an
8-inch kitchen knife, police said Wednesday.
   Smith, 59, was arrested Tuesday in the San Fernando Valley and
was booked for investigation of assault with a deadly weapon, said
police Lt. John Bradbury.
   ``He was also under the influence of a substance, probably
heroin, at the time of his arrest,'' said Van Nuys police Lt.
Warren Knowles.
   It was the latest in a series of arrests since Smith was paroled
in February 1982 after serving 19 years in prison for his role in
the March 1963 slaying of Los Angeles Police Officer Ian Campbell.
   Campbell and Officer Karl Hettinger were abducted by Smith and
Gregory Powell and taken to an onion field, where Powell killed
Campbell and shot at Hettinger, who escaped. The slaying and trial
were recounted in Joseph Wambaugh's best-selling 1973 novel ``The
Onion Field,'' which was made into a movie.
   Powell and Smith were twice sentenced to death for the killing,
but the sentences were reduced to life in prison when the state
Supreme Court ruled tht the death penalty was unconstitutional.
Powell is serving a life term.
   Most of Smith's post-parole encounters with police involved
narcotics arrests.
   His latest brush with the law occurred April 18 in Van Nuys,
when he argued with his female roommate and she ordered him to move
out, Bradbury said. When a male friend intervened, Smith ``drew an
8-inch knife and said he would cut him,'' the lieutenant said.

<HEAD>New Test Approved For Hepatitis C</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday
licensed the first test to screen blood for hepatitis C, a somtimes
fatal disease spread mostly through blood transfusions.
   About 170,000 Americans contract the disease annually, and about
half the cases progress to chronic hepatitis. The hepatitis C virus
is responsible for about 90 percent of the hepatitis spread through
blood transfusions.
   Ortho Diagnostic Systems, a subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson,
received approval to make and market the test, said Robert Kniffin,
a company spokesman.
   ``The test is being shipped to blood centers across the country
and they will use it to screen blood immediately,'' Kniffin said.
   The test is already sold in Australia, Belgium, Canada, France,
Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain and Finland, Kniffin said.
   The FDA is recommending that all U.S. blood banks use the test,
said FDA spokeswoman Faye Peterson.
   About 20 percent of the hepatitis C cases that progress to
chronic hepatitis then progress to cirrhosis, which can be fatal,
Kniffin said. This virus is also associated with liver cancer, he
said.
   The federal Centers for Disease Control reported 28,500 cases of
hepatitis A were diagnosed in 1988. This hepatitis virus, which
does not progress to chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis of the liver,
is spread primarily by contact with contaminated food and water.
   Hepatitis B, with about 300,000 new cases occurring each year,
is spread mostly through sexual contact, most commonly among
homosexuals, and among intravenous drug users. About 5 percent to
10 percent of these cases progress to chronic hepatitis or
cirrhosis.

   Plans for soul singer James Brown to
perform in a benefit concert this month while he serves time in a
work-release program were nixed twice Wednesday by the state
Corrections Department.
   On Monday, a Los Angeles promoter said Brown would hold a
concert May 16 the King Street Palace in Charleston with Gladys
Knight, Little Richard, Jermaine Jackson and others.
   The Corrections Department said no go.
   A New York concert organizer then said Wednesday that the
benefit concert had been moved from Charleston to Aikin.
   Nope, the Corrections Department said again.
   Proceeds from the ``James Brown and Friends'' concert were to
have gone to the non-profit Aiken-Barnwell Counties Community
Action Commission, where Brown works as a counselor, said Peter
Paul of the Stephen Cooper Entertainment Corp. in Los Angeles.
   Brown, serving a six-year sentence for aggravated assault, has
been working for the commission since shortly after his April 14
transfer from prison to a work-release program.
   Corrections Department spokesman Francis X. Archibald said
Wednesday the concert ``is not going to happen.''
   ``This is inconsistent with his employment with the
Aiken-Barnwell community agency. We didn't allow him to perform
while he was in prison and we can't let him perform down there just
because he's been sent to a work center,'' he said.
   Archibald said the concert was a commercial venture and not all
proceeds would go to the commission. The event was to have been
filmed as part of a television special on Brown's life, according
to Paul.
   ``As part of being in prison, your liberties are restricted and
you're taken away from your commercial life,'' Archibald said.
``That applies to entertainers, stockbrokers, bankers and anyone
else who goes to prison.''
   Officials with the King Street Palace and community action
center did not return telephone calls from The Associated Press
seeking comment. Brown will only respond to written inquiries,
center officials said.
   Later Wednesday, Larry Myers of the Universal Attractions
booking agency in New York said concert organizers were now going
ahead with plans for a May 16 benefit performance in Aiken instead
of Charleston _ despite the department's stance.
   The concert is to be held at the University of South
Carolina-Aiken, said Myers, whose agency has booked concerts for
Brown for more than 25 years.
   The change in location notwithstanding, Archibald said the
department was firm in its position.
   ``Any entertainment Mr. Brown does has to be related directly
and solely to his job,'' he said. ``We cannot allow some small
benefit (for the commission) ... to be used as a cover for a
larger, commercial exploitation.''
   Brown, who turns 57 Thursday, was imprisoned in December 1988 to
serve concurrent six-year sentences in Georgia and South Carolina
for failing to stop for police, aggravated assault and weapons
violations stemming from a two-state car chase in 1988. He becomes
eligible for parole in South Carolina in May 1991 and in Georgia in
March 1992.
   Brown is known for such hits as ``Papa's Got A Brand New Bag,''
``I Got You (I Feel Good),'' and more recently ``I'm Real'' and
``Living in America.''

<HEAD>Airline Official: Smelled Alcohol on Pilots After Flight</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Northwest Airlines supervisor testified
Wednesday he smelled alcohol on three flight crew members just
after they had flown a Northwest passenger jet.
   ``I smelled alcohol on each of them as I introduced myself and
it seemed they had been drinking,'' Bradley Berntson testified
before U.S. Magistrate J. Earl Cudd.
   Blood tests taken about 90 minutes after the plane landed showed
the three had blood-alcohol levels higher than allowed by the
federal government. The Federal Aviation Administration then
revoked their pilot licenses and the airline later fired them.
   Defense attorneys contend the blood-alcohol tests were obtained
unconstitutionally. Cudd is hearing pretrial motions to suppress
the test results of the three, who face federal charges of
operating an airplane while under the influence of alcohol.
   Another witness, Douglas McKeen, an attorney for the
Minnesota-based airline, said Wednesday he was consulted by company
officials before the blood tests were performed.
   ``I clearly believe we had reason to believe it was necessary,''
McKeen said.
   Berntson, service manager in charge of Northwest's control
center operations, said he was asked by Federal Aviation
Administration officials to meet the crew of Flight 650 at
Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport on March 8.
   Officials had received an anonymous tip that the crew was
drinking heavily at a bar the night before the early-morning
takeoff, Berntson said.
   The charges against Capt. Norman Prouse, 51, of Conyers, Ga.,
first officer Robert J. Kirchner, 35, of Highland Ranch, Colo., and
flight engineer Joseph Balzer, 34, of Antioch, Tenn., stem from a
flight that left at 6:25 a.m. from Fargo and went to
Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.
   The Boeing 727 carrying 91 passengers landed without incident.
   After meeting the flight crew at the passenger gate, Berntson
said they took an elevator to a Northwest conference room upstairs.
``There was a very strong odor of alcohol in the elevator,'' he
said.
   Defense attorneys also claim that citizen's arrests by an FAA
official at the Minnesota airport were unlawful.

   A former housing official said Wednesday that
Samuel R. Pierce Jr. was deeply involved in steering federal grants
to friends while HUD secretary, and that one grant was arranged
after a developer appealed to then-Vice President George Bush.
   DuBois L. Gilliam, once deputy assistant secretary of the
Department of Housing and Urban Development and now serving a
federal sentence for corruption, linked Bush to a $500,000 federal
grant for a Hispanic trade center in Kansas City, Mo.
   Gilliam, who admits taking bribes, testified for a second day
before a congressional panel investigating the HUD scandal.
   Speaking with a grant of immunity from further prosecution,
Gilliam detailed how he and others manipulated programs to direct
lucrative subsidies to friends, including members of Congress _
sometimes before any formal applications were made.
   Gilliam said he arranged to profit himself and secretly removed
incriminating documents from the agency in a medicine bag for
destruction.
   When he left the agency under a cloud in 1987, Gilliam said he
asked for and was given approval from Pierce through an aide to
receive grants for low-income housing renovations _ in effect a
severance payment worth a million dollars or more in resale value
to developers. He ultimately did not receive the grants.
   ``I'm touching upon the truth,'' Gilliam said when his
credibilty was challenged. ``I have no reason to lie, no reason
whatsoever.''
   Gilliam's mention of President Bush was disclosed beforehand by
the chairman of the panel, Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., who has spent
more than a year investigating the scandals at HUD during the
Reagan presidency.
   Gilliam did not accuse Bush of directly ordering the HUD grant
go to a political ally. But Gilliam said he took unusual steps to
award the grant in 1985 after Hector Barreto, then president of the
U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and a supporter of Bush and
President Reagan, met with the vice president.
   Gilliam said he told Barreto that his proposal for a feasibility
study was not eligible for funding by HUD under the secretary's
discretion program. But Barreto, he said, left saying he would meet
with the vice president.
   Later that same afternoon, Gilliam said, he was told by Pierce's
executive assistant Deborah Gore Dean that Barreto met with Bush.
   ``She indicated to me that she had received a call from the vice
president's staff people indicating their support and wanted to get
the project funded,'' he said.
   Gilliam said he then persuaded a Kansas City assistant city
manager, James I. Threatt, to provide the grant from the city's
Community Development Block Grant funds provided by HUD. In turn,
Gilliam said he arranged to have a special grant from the
secretary's discretionary fund go to Kansas City to replace that
money.
   ``In other words, let's make a deal _ you do this and I'll do
this,'' Gilliam said.
   Gilliam said he was unsure of the connection but that Dean had
also mentioned ``something about Hector being on the vice
president's plane.'' Before the testimony, Lantos charged the
project was funded ``in order to get a Hispanic leader to accompany
the then-vice president on a plane trip to Puerto Rico.''
   Steve Hart, a White House spokesman, was asked for a response to
Gilliam's account. He replied, ``We don't know anything about it.''
   Pierce is the object of a special prosecutor's investigation
into his handling of HUD's section 8 moderate rehabilitation
subsidies program for low-income housing renovations. Pierce
testified before the panel once last year and later invoked his
constitutional rights not to incriminate himself to avoid further
testimony.
   His lawyers have attacked Gilliam's testimony, saying he was
trying to win early release from prison. Gilliam said he is
eligible for parole at any time, and his 18-month sentence is up
later this year.
   Dean and two other former top aides to Pierce have also refused
to testify on constitutional grounds.
   Gilliam said Pierce accepted huge cuts in HUD's overall budget
while fighting White House efforts to cut his own secretary's
discretionary fund. Gilliam said that fund was used to reward
friends and help political allies in election years.
   He described one case in which Pierce told him he wanted a grant
to go to Tougaloo University in Mississippi, where a Pierce friend
sat on the board of trustees.
   Their proposal for a $300,000 grant did meet eligibility
standards, Gilliam said, so he reached agreement with the mayor of
a nearby town, Ridgeland, to accept the grant and pass it on to the
college _ with an additional $50,000 for the town's use.
   ``A handling charge,'' Lantos called it.
   Gilliam said he was shocked to learn other top aides to Pierce
kept records that listed supporters of pending grants, including
his own support of four projects.
   One of those was for a proposed Selma, Ala., project. Gilliam
said that when he left the agency in 1987 he arranged to recieve a
$20,000 consultant's retainer and one-third ownership of the
project, from which he expected $600,000 to $700,000 upon
completion.

   Hawaiians stood by stoically Wednesday
morning as the angry volcano goddess Pele cut a fiery path toward
the heart of this dying coastal town.
   It may be foolish to deny the natural process that created
Kilauea Volcano and now pumps tons of molten lava from it, but it's
just as ridiculous to deny the ways of Madame Pele. Like the
volcano, she is respected for her awesome power.
   The goddess' large presence in Hawaiian folklore shows how much
respect the Hawaiian people have for their land, a product of
ancient volcanic eruptions. Most kamaainas, or local residents,
don't worship Pele exclusively, but pay homage to her for the
beauty they live in.
   ``It's more a respect for the land and the volcano than a
religion,'' said Reggie Okamura of the National Volcano
Observatory. ``I have some belief. It's inherent to anyone born and
raised here.''
   Legend says if Pele is not shown proper respect through the
bestowing of gifts, or if people try to ruin the land she has
formed, she'll roar out of Kilauea to vent her wrath.
   Ed Lorenz has lived in the shadow of Kilauea Volcano most of his
60 years and watched, along with others, as homes have been torched
by the fiery lava. Two homes were destroyed Wednesday and five
Tuesday, bringing to 128 the number burned down since Kilauea began
erupting in January 1983.
   More than 50 were destroyed in the past month. In this community
alone, where 125 homes once stood, only 31 homes remain. Others
burned along the path from the volcano to Kalapana.
   Several more homes were in danger of falling Wednesday. The
volcano, about six miles away, has spewed lava to within less than
270 yards of the heart of the town: the Kalapana Store and Drive-In.
   Lorenz, a believer in Pele's power, says the goddess is as angry
as he's ever seen.
   `If she wasn't mad, she wouldn't damage any houses,'' Lorenz
said. ``I've seen a lot of flows, but this is one of the worst.''
   Lorenz says Pele is upset with real estate developers,
geothermal energy drillers and marijuana growers for profiting off
her land and not offering her sacrifices.
   The east side of Hawaii Island is one of the few remaining
places in the state where land is reasonably priced, and many are
looking to settle here.
   Geothermal companies are drilling in the Wao Kele O Puna rain
forest, looking to convert heat from the volcano into energy. Many
say Pele will not stop her destructive ways until geothermal
exploration stops.
   ``They're growing pakololo (marijuana) and making big money off
her land,'' Lorenz said. ``Now she's taking it all away.
   ``How many millions of dollars are they making and they're not
going to offer her nothing _ not even a feast and bring it to her.
What a bunch of dummies,'' he said.
   Walter Yamaguchi, who owns the Kalapana Store and Drive-In,
makes food offerings to Pele daily. His store has been spared on
several previous flows.
   ``Let her take it if she wants it,'' said Yamaguchi, 82. ``She
can do what she wants. It's hers if she wants it.''
   Even Gov. John Waihee, who toured the area Tuesday, said the
fate of Kalapana is in Pele's hands.
   ``Nobody can tell Madame Pele when it all ends,'' the governor
said. ``Nobody can tell her what to do.''
   Legend also says Pele gets upset when people try to run away
from her and that she will find and destroy them.
   This doesn't seem to scare officials at Star of the Sea Church.
Workers are preparing to relocate the renowned ``painted church''
from destruction.
   Not all in the congregation want to move the church. They say it
shows a lack of faith by the congregation and a lack of respect for
Pele.
   In contrast, the Kalapana Mauna Loa Congregation Church,
originally built in the 1800s and located at its present site next
to the store for 102 years, is not moving.
   Deacon Ed Kahanu said the church's foundation is rotted with
termites and isn't worth moving anyway.
   ``If God wants to save it, He will,'' Kahanu said. ``It's His
church, He can do what He wants.''

   The Democratic-controlled Senate Budget
Committee on Wednesday made the deepest cut yet in proposed
Pentagon spending, approving a 1991 budget that pares President
Bush's military plans by $9.9 billion.
   The panel adopted the $1.2 trillion spending plan, which says it
will reduce next year's deficit by $43 billion, on a 14-9 vote.
Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa was the only Republican to join the
committee Democrats in voting for the package.
   Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn., who pieced together
the proposal, called it ``a clear and clarion call to the White
House to get behind some real deficit reduction.''
   Bush's budget seeks $36 billion in deficit reduction.
   Sasser said his package could serve as a benchmark should
negotiations be held this year between the White House and
congressional leaders. Democrats are split over whether there is a
need for formal budget talks with Bush, while Republicans argue
such bargaining is a necessity.
   At the White House, spokesman Steve Hart said: ``We are not
prepared to respond to specifics. We still feel the president's
budget is the best proposal up there. It will continue to be the
basis of any discussions we have.''
   The administration and congressional Democrats have been dueling
all year over how Pentagon spending should be adjusted as a result
of political changes in Eastern Europe. The White House has urged a
cautious approach, while Democrats are eager to use some military
dollars for social programs and to reduce the deficit.
   The $293.9 billion the panel recommended for defense is $1.6
billion less than the amount the House included in the budget it
adopted Tuesday. It's $4.1 billion below the amount Senate Armed
Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., has said is needed
next year. Nunn is one of Capitol Hill's most influential Democrats
on defense matters.
   The Senate figure is $13 billion less than the amount military
programs would need next year to keep up with inflation. Bush
proposed $303.8 billion for fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1.
   Sasser said his committee's budget addresses ``a new era in
which economic vitality will be the true measure of the strength of
the nation, rather than just solely military strength.''
   Republicans called it an unrealistic proposal that by itself
stands little chance of accomplishing the deficit reduction it
claims.
   ``I believe we're going to end up with minimal deficit reduction
in spite of this budget, unless there are major negotiating
sessions with the president and congressional leadership,'' said
the panel's ranking Republican, Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico.
   The budget, which lays out the government's financial plans,
does not need the president's signature. But later spending and tax
bills will, and proponents of negotiations with the White House say
the president will veto deficit-reduction measures he opposes.
   Overall, Sasser's plan says it will produce a deficit of $58.6
billion next year. The Gramm-Rudman law requires a shortfall of no
more than $64 billion.
   The measure would raise $13.9 billion in new tax receipts, the
same figure Bush proposed, and $6.2 billion in user fees and other
revenues.
   It would limit the growth of benefit programs such as Medicare
by $5.6 billion and cut other domestic and foreign aid programs by
$3.6 billion.
   Sasser said there are eight to 10 domestic programs he would cut
or eliminate to produce the savings, including the superconducting
super-collider, foreign aid and grants to renovate rental housing
units.
   ``We've got to realize every single program in the federal
budget is not sacrosanct,'' Sasser said.
   In contrast, the House-passed budget would increase domestic and
foreign aid programs by $5.6 billion next year.
   The House approved its spending plan 218-208, with all 174
voting Republicans opposing the package.
   The Senate committee's budget also embraced a plan to collect
another $11.1 billion in taxes by waiving penalties for tax-dodgers
and beefing up the Internal Revenue Service. That money, however,
was not formally included within the $43 billion savings package.
   Sasser said the budget should be considered by the full Senate
within 10 days.

<HEAD>Soviet Immigration Activists Warn of Impending Catastrophe</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Soviet Jewish immigration activists warned an
Israeli minister Wednesday that Israel was close to a
``catastrophe'' in its handling of a wave of Soviet newcomers.
   The heated television debate came just a day after immigration
officials said a record 10,500 Soviet Jews had arrived in April.
   That same day hundreds of Soviet immigrants rallied in a coastal
resort town, demanding employment and housing. Immigrants have also
complained of a lack of job opportunities.
   Absorption Minister Yitzhak Peretz, facing the angry activists,
tried to appear upbeat and said that ``Israel deals with absorption
exceedingly well, including permanent housing.''
   But Natan Sharansky, the human rights champion who spent nine
years in Soviet labor camps before immigrating to Israel in 1986,
sharply disagreed.
   ``We have lines of people seeking apartments, and it's already
clear that we would not have a single apartment in a few months.
For a year we speak about construction and we are not building.''
   The Israeli media has reported 30,000 Soviet Jews have arrived
so far in 1990. Officials say they expect about 100,000 Soviet
immigrants this year, compared to 12,000 Soviet Jews who arrived in
1989.
   Sharansky, who heads the Soviet Jewry Zionist Forum, a public
organization that helps absorb Soviet immigrants, gave a much
higher estimate:
   ``We expect 250,000 immigrants this year and at least 500,000
next year... This is a real evacuation. What's good for us is that
they feel it's more dangerous to stay in Russia despite all the
difficulties of absorption.''
   ``But we will really have a catastrophe with absorption. ...
There would be pressures on America'' to open its doors for Soviet
Jews and lift current visa restrictions, he warned.
   The lack of housing, employment problems and the stifling
absorption bureacracy are felt throughout Israel. In the northern
port of Haifa on Wednesday, an AP photographer saw hundreds of
immigrants waiting in line for processing at an absorption center.
   In the coastal resort of Netanya on Tuesday, hundreds of Soviet
Jews demonstrated, holding signs that read: ``We want work, we want
apartments,'' and ``Absorption Minister, go home.''
   Peretz said the government has approved plans to build 30,000
new apartments and that work has started on 6,000. But he said it
could take 15 months until the first of the new apartments are on
the market.
   ``We will have a difficult transition period,'' Peretz said.
   The mass immigration comes at a time when Israel faces almost 10
percent unemployment. The unemployment is especially severe in
remote areas, where apartments are abundant, but Soviet Jews are
reluctant to live.
   Yermiyahu Branover, a Beersheba University physicist who also
runs an immigrant-oriented company in Jerusalem, argued that Israel
had no clear plan on providing employment for Soviet Jews.
   ``Fifty percent of them have academic degrees. ... The state
should have a professionally devised master plan, and till this
very day we don't have such a plan,'' Branover said.

<HEAD>Expert Witness: Sewage Dumping Doesn't Hurt Water Quality</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RON WORD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A water quality expert testified
Wednesday that Amtrak's practice of dumping raw human waste from
its trains has no significant impact on water quality in the St.
Johns River and Rice Creek.
   Dr. Robert Harris, a consultant hired by Amtrak, testified in
the third day of a hearing before U.S. District Judge Howell Melton
on whether the state can prosecute the national passenger rail
service for dumping raw sewage in Florida.
   Assistant State Attorney Dennis Bayer, who prosecuted the
railroad in Putnam County for commercial littering, said the
hearing, originally scheduled to end Wednesday, probably would
continue through Friday.
   Harris estimated the amount of waste dumped by Amtrak trains
crossing bridges over the river and creek and determined ``there
was no significant impact on water quality.''
   He estimated that the amount of waste dumped into the waterways
by the railroad was the equivalent of the daily discharge of one
person for a day.
   If anything, Harris said, his assumptions overestimated the
amount of waste dumped from Amtrak trains.
   Last December, Amtrak was convicted by a jury in Palatka on four
state felony charges of disposing of wastes into the two streams.
   Amtrak could face up to $20,000 in fines if the federal judge
determines that the railroad is bound by state pollution laws,
rather than federal laws that allow it to dump. Sentencing for the
state conviction was delayed pending Judge Melton's decision.
   Fishermen had complained that they were sprayed with sewage
while fishing under rail trestles as Amtrak trains passed overhead.
   Amtrak conductor Carl E. Harris testified Wednesday that
passengers are now asked not to flush train toilets when passing
over waterways near Palatka.
   Amtrak officials have said they would have to suspend service to
Florida if train toilets cannot be flushed onto the roadbed.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mugger with a knife robbed a messenger of $478
million in financial certificates on Wednesday, forcing the Bank of
England to come to the London money market's rescue.
   Although no cash was involved, it was a British robbery record,
far above the estimated $48 million haul from a looted London safe
deposit store in 1987.
   The state-run Bank of England said it had to inject into the
money market an amount equivalent to the face value of the stolen
certificates. It said this was to avoid problems for their owners
and eliminate the risk that a shortage of liquidity would increase
overnight lending rates.
   The Bank said a ``remote'' chance existed that the certificates
could be used illegally to secure a bank loan but it would be
``extraordinarily difficult'' to use the missing paper to raise
cash.
   ``Anyone trying to cash or use these documents would need to
demonstrate he has good title to them,'' said a bank spokesman, who
refused to be identified.
   The Bank of England said that within 45 minutes of the robbery's
being reported, the Bank warned money market firms and banks and
sent descriptions of the missing property to the London offices of
foreign central banks to circulate around the world.
   Police said a briefcase containing the certificates was snatched
from 58-year-old messenger John Goddard as he walked from Sheppards
money brokers to another finance house in the City financial
district.
   Goddard, a longtime employee, was unhurt. Sheppards refused to
comment. Police said the robber was black, in his late twenties and
wielded a knife.
   Unescorted messengers in the densely crowded City have been
robbed before and the system has often been called archaic.
   The Bank of England said the messenger system, which is more
than 100 years old, was ``plainly unsatisfactory,'' and by the end
of this year it expects to have on line a new computerized system
for settling money transactions.
   Wednesday's haul consisted of certificates of deposit with a
face value of 121.9 million pounds (nearly $200 million) and
Treasury bills worth 170 million pounds ($278 million) that mature
for payment on July 30.
   The paper is regularly traded between banks and some finance
houses.
   Certificates of deposit are issued to companies in exchange for
depositing large amounts of money with a bank or finance house over
a fixed period and companies can buy and sell them as a way of
raising money.
   Treasury bills are a form of IOU issued by the government to
raise short-term money. Their face value can be claimed when they
mature on a fixed date.
   In January, a City worker found four bond certificates each
worth $1.6 million and stated to be as good as cash lying in the
gutter outside the Stock Exchange. They were handed back to the
owners.

<TEXT>
   British publisher Robert Maxwell announced
Wednesday that The European, the weekly English-language newspaper
he plans to launch in Europe on May 11, will be available in the
United States after Labor Day.
   Maxwell said the newspaper would sell on newsstands throughout
the country for $1 or $1.50, with the same news content as the
European edition but perhaps some different advertising.
   The weekend newspaper will appear on newsstands in Europe on
Friday mornings, but might be later than that in parts of the
United States, he said.
   He said he plans to talk to the Gannett Co., publisher of USA
Today and many other American dailies, about printing the American
edition.
   Maxwell said he hopes to expand to daily publication.
   The newspaper will be 64 pages, with three sections. Two
full-size sections of 16 pages each will cover European news,
politics, business and sports. A 32-page tabloid will cover
European culture and lifestyle.
   A prototype issue distributed at Maxwell's news conference
featured a front-page story on the effects on German reunification
of the attempted murder of West German opposition political leader
Oskar Lafontaine.
   Inside were stories on pressures keeping European air fares
high, the development of the tunnel under the English channel and a
controversial Spanish cycling star, Pedro Delgado. A profile of
opera star Tizziana Fabricini highlighted the tabloid section.
   The prototype was long on analysis and profiles and made
generous use of color photographs.
   Maxwell said more than 100 million people speak English in
Europe and he needs to sell about 300,000 copies to make a profit.
   More than 1 million copies will be printed, he said.
   The publisher said The European will have news bureaus in
Washington, New York and on the Pacific Coast, and will depend on
news services for other coverage of North America. It will have a
staff of more than 100 journalists.

   U.S. officials said there was no new
information on the whereabouts of an American mining company worker
believed abducted by Colombian rebels who crossed into Ecuadoran
territory.
   ``At the moment, there's nothing new about the case,'' said
Patricia Norman, a spokeswoman for the U.S. embassy in the
Ecuadoran capital. ``We don't know if there is any demand for a
ransom.''
   The kidnap victim, identified by embassy officials as Scott
Heimdal, 27, heads a dredging operation for Iminco Co., a
gold-mining company near the Ecuadoran-Colombian border. Heimdal's
hometown is Peoria, Ill.
   He was captured by rebels believed to belong to the Popular
Liberation Army of Colombia.
   ``We have not received any calls from the people who took him.
We are in contact with Heimdal's parents in the United States,''
said Jeffrey J. Fino, general manager of Iminco.
   Ecuadoran armed forces launched an air-and-land search Sunday,
but U.S. officials said they believe Heimdal is being held in
neighboring Colombia.
   The U.S. Embassy in Bogota and Colombian police said Wednesday
that they had no information on Heimdal's abduction.
   Ecuadoran reports said Heimdal was traveling with three
Ecuadorans and a Colombian boat pilot to a support camp in the
jungle when their boat was stopped by a group of guerrillas
wielding automatic weapons.
   The guerrillas opened fire killing the boat pilot, Julio Torres,
and wounding one of the Ecuadoran passengers.
   The guerrillas then kidnapped Heimdal and an Ecuadoran student,
Edwin Rodrigo Teneda, 29.
   The kidnappers later released Teneda with two letters written by
Heimdal, one to his family and the other to his company. The
letters' contents were not revealed.
   Authorities said Heimdal was last seen on a boat moving up the
Rumiyacu River, a heavily jungled area that crosses into Colombia.
   The southern Colombian border region is a frequent crossing
ground too for drug-traffickers.

<TEXT>
   Possibly inspired by its corporate-sounding
name, a gang that calls itself Damage Inc. has printed up business
cards for members.
   Police working at recent downtown carnival made the discovery as
they talked to members of several different gangs.
   Authorities said several Damage Inc. members opened their
wallets, pulled out the business cards with the gang name and
proudly displayed them. Officers described the cards as
``professional-looking.''
   ``It was hilarious,'' one unidentified patrol officer said.
``These guys actually had these things printed up somewhere and
they were carrying them on their person.''
   Police say Damage Inc. got its name from the title of a concert
tour by the heavy-metal rock group Metallica about two years ago.
   Members of the gang range in age from 14 to 16. They are
suspected in a number of assaults, criminal mischief cases, auto
thefts and shootings, and some have been arrested at schools for
carrying guns, police said.
   San Antonio police Capt. Al Philippus said the police department
wants to study local gangs to determine what impact they are having
on the city's crime.
   The department has applied for a $148,000 federal grant to form
a gang unit and should know within 60 days whether it will receive
the money.

<TEXT>
   About 1,500 striking workers clashed
with police Wednesday near a shipyard where union leaders
barricaded inside a giant crane threatened ``an extreme fight''
unless arrested unionists were freed.
   Also Wednesday, police continued searching for dozens of
fugitive labor leaders involved in strikes at the shipyard, a
broadcast network and other work sites.
   At least 80 policemen and 14 workers have been injured and 500
people arrested in labor unrest throughout the country. The
violence and arrests began after police stormed the Hyundai Heavy
Industries Co. shipyard, the nation's largest, over the weekend to
end a three-day strike.
   At the shipyard in Ulsan, an industrial city 200 miles southeast
of Seoul, about 120 union leaders remained atop a giant crane and
vowed Wednesday to fight until the arrested labor leaders were
released.
   On nearby roads, sporadic clashes continued between bands of
shipyard workers armed with stones and steel pipes and riot
troopers guarding the shipyard. Police opened fire with tear gas
and one protester was hospitalized after fragments from the tear
gas shell struck his face and hand.
   The shipyard strike initially began over demands to release four
union leaders jailed for instigating earlier protests.
   Banks and factories were closed Wednesday for a national
holiday, but sympathy strikes continued.
   Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon and senior economic and labor
ministry officials met Wednesday to discuss the unrest.
   The government has demanded an end to what it calls illegal
strikes and says the already slumping South Korean economy might
suffer further damage unless labor unrest eases. A prolonged labor
dispute in 1987 slowed exports and led to increased unemployment.
   Also Wednesday, police brought charges against 11 of the 333
workers at the Korea Broadcasting System arrested Monday. The other
KBS workers were released after vowing not to stage protests,
police said.
   On Monday 2,400 police staged a midnight raid to end a 19-day
protest against the network's new president.
   About 500 KBS workers held a rally at the nearby Munwha
Broadcasting Co. network, where about 1,000 Munwha workers walked
off their jobs for the second-day of a sympathy strike.
   Munwha union leaders said Wednesday they would extend their
sympathy strikes until Sunday and other networks announced similar
sympathy strikes.
   At the Hyundai shipyard, workers atop a 240-foot crane said they
would only come down only if the company dropped charges against
the arrested union leaders.
   ``If police come, we will stage an extreme fight,'' Lee
Kap-yong, 31, told reporters inivted to a news conference aboard
the crane Tuesday night. ``We have made full preparations against a
police raid by helicopters.''
   The Hyundai Motor Co., the nation's largest automaker, and 11
other Hyundai subsidiaries in Ulsan decided to resume production
Thursday regardless of the union strikes.

<HEAD>Archbishop Tutu Calls Pretoria-ANC Talks `Mind Boggling'</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-South Africa, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EXETER, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archbishop Desmond Tutu called
``mind-boggling'' Wednesday's first talks between the South African
government and the African National Congress and said too much was
at stake for either side to be ``bloody-minded.''
   The black Anglican archbishop of Cape Town, an anti-apartheid
campaigner and 1984 Nobel Peace laureate, said he didn't expect
important agreements to emerge from the preliminary talks in Cape
Town which end Friday.
   ``I just think what most of the people in our community would
like to hear is a real commitment on all sides to talks,'' he told
a news conference at Exeter University.
   ``And that we want to go in to substantive negotiations, that
would be important and give hope to people who are tired of the
violence of apartheid and the counterviolence of those who oppose
apartheid.''
   Tutu came to Britain Wednesday for a three-day visit shortly
before the talks began. He lectured Wednesday night in this
university city in southwest England.
   Asked by reporters at London's Heathrow Airport if he believed
much could be achieved in the first round, he said:
   ``I am very hopeful. I don't think that any of those people, on
both sides, are going into those talks bloody-minded. We've got too
much at stake. Too many people have already died, too many people
have suffered.''
   Tutu said South African President F.W. de Klerk knew that unless
he settled with the black majority ``the whole question of
sanctions and apartheid economy will be exacerbated.''
   Tutu commented, ``It's actually almost mind-boggling to think
that they are now sitting across the table with the people they
tried to demonize.''
   ``On the ANC side, they know that most of their supporters would
like to see an end to violence,'' the prelate said.
   He called South Africa's racial-segregation system ``one of the
most vicious the world has seen.''
   Tutu criticized British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for
opposing sanctions on South Africa.
   ``We admire her eloquency in condemning apartheid. We just wish
there was a matching consistency in action,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Bob Martinez vetoed a $4.7 billion
transportation tax hike and construction bill Wednesday as
roadbuilders ringed the Capitol with heavy equipment to protest his
decision.
   The first-term Republican governor, who is still trying to make
voters forget his aborted support of a highly unpopular services
tax in 1987, said the bill's 4-cent-a-gallon gas tax increase was
unacceptable.
   ``I believe Floridians don't want to be taxed just to spend,''
said Martinez, who trails both Democratic gubernatorial hopefuls in
the latest statewide poll.
   Martinez favors allowing local governments to make the tax
decision, and he said the Legislature's bill allowed the people no
voice in imposing the levy.
   ``I fear the framers of this legislation have lost sight of the
fact that there are limits to how deeply the people of Florida are
willing to reach into their pockets to pay for questionable
projects,'' added Martinez. He said the proposed tax would not pay
for local road needs and spent too much for mass transit.
   Counting both the gas tax and a boost in the gasoline sales tax,
the bill would have raised the overall tax on gasoline from 9.7
cents a gallon now to almost 15 cents.
   In addition, auto title fees would have risen from $3 to $24,
and a surcharge on rental cars would have increased from 50 cents
to $2. A ``new wheels on the roads'' fee would have gone from $30
to $100; that is aimed at additional cars, such as new residents
bringing in cars from elsewhere or people adding a second or third
car to their garage.
   The bill would have raised $3.6 billion over six years for
roads, bridges and mass transit as well as authorize $1.1 billion
in bonds to expand the turnpike system.
   Protest organizers said about 85 trucks and tractor-trailer
rigs, many hauling bulldozers and asphalt spreaders, honked horns
and displayed signs such as ``Please Governor _ My Job is in Your
Hands'' and ``Today the Highway, Tomorrow the Repo Lot.''
   ``They're willing to drive hundreds of miles to save their
jobs,'' said state Sen. Howard Forman, a co-sponsor of the bill.
``It's got to be worth something.''
   The truck protest was the latest effort by the Floridians for
Better Transportation group to pressure Martinez into signing the
bill. The group, made up mainly of roadbuilders, also made hundreds
of telephone calls and sent some 1,500 letters to the governor's
office.
   Earlier Wednesday, House Speaker Tom Gustafson and Senate
President Bob Crawford implored Martinez not to kill the package,
which was 1{ years in the making.
   ``I believe we're at the end of our stack of cheap, easy,
painless solutions,'' Gustafson said. ``This is still needed
legislation.''
   The speaker claimed the veto could paralyze the construction
industry and that Florida's roads would become more dangerous.
   ``This plan is the Legislature's compromise, and it is our
bottom line,'' Gustafson said.
   Martinez replied: ``There's still four weeks to go in this
session. One thing we should never do in government is come up with
an ultimatum, all or nothing.''
   Neither Republicans nor Democrats in either the House or Senate
believe a veto override is possible. While the bill passed both
chambers by the necessary two-thirds margin, many GOP lawmakers who
voted for the package said they would not join an override attempt.
   House Minority Leader Dale Patchett said Republicans will offer
a plan containing elements Martinez can support, such as increased
motorist fees and bond sales for turnpikes.

   U.S. Rep. Donald Lukens apologized
Wednesday for ``a dumb mistake'' and announced he is actively
seeking re-election even though his appeal on a conviction of
having sex with a teen-ager is pending.
   The state's chairman of the Republican Party, however, repeated
a call for Lukens to resign from Congress.
   ``We don't have much time,'' Lukens said in making his
announcement in this western Ohio village, 30 miles north of
Dayton. The GOP primary election is Tuesday.
   He had said since his conviction last May that he would not
decide on his political future until after the outcome of his
appeal. Although he filed for re-election to put his name on the
ballot, he had not campaigned and never announced he was running.
   The 59-year-old divorced congressman was convicted of a
misdemeanor charge of contributing to the unruliness of a minor. He
was accused of paying a girl to have sex with him at his Columbus
apartment in November 1988, when she was 16.
   A judge sentenced Lukens to 30 days in jail and fined him $500.
He has been free on bond pending his appeal.
   ``I apologize. I made a dumb mistake. I'm sorry,'' Lukens said.
``I'm paying a big price for that mistake.''
   In Greenville, Lukens repeated his message to about 20 people,
saying in spite of his ``stumble,'' he's never stopped working for
his constituents.
   Lukens wrapped up Wednesday evening in his hometown of
Middletown, where he spoke briefly to about 50 supporters outside
an American Legion Hall.
   ``The people know men and they know my record, let them judge,''
Lukens said. ``Nobody knows any politician in the country better
than you know me.''
   Robert Bennett, chairman of the Ohio GOP, said Lukens displayed
``a lapse of morals'' and had abused the trust of his constituents.
   ``This is not a political matter; it's a moral matter.
Congressman Lukens has never denied having sex with a child, and on
that issue alone he should not represent the people of the 8th
District,'' Bennett said.
   Lukens faces opposition from three other Republicans: Thomas
Kindness, who held the 8th District seat before Lukens was elected
in 1986; state Rep. John Boehner, and Mort Meier, a bond
underwriter. Three candidates are running in the Democratic primary.
   Lukens served two terms in Congress from 1967 to 1970, when he
made an unsuccessful attempt to gain the Ohio GOP gubernatorial
nomination. After 15 years in the Ohio Senate, he was returned to
Congress in 1986, when Kindness stepped down to run against
Democratic U.S. Sen. John Glenn. Lukens was re-elected in 1988.

<TEXT>
   A Mexican man wanted in connection with
the murder of a journalist was arrested in the United States and
turned over to Baja California state judicial authorities, Gov.
Ernesto Ruffo Appel said Wednesday.
   Ruffo told a news conference in the state capital Mexicali that
Antonio Vera Palestina was picked up Tuesday afternoon by police in
El Monte, Calif., where he was living as an illegal alien under an
assumed name. The suspect was deported to Mexico the same evening,
Ruffo said.
   Vera Palestina is wanted for the April 20, 1988, fatal shooting
in Tijuana of Hector Felix Miranda, a muckraking columnist and
co-publisher of the weekly newspaper Zeta, also known as ``El
Gato'' or The Cat.
   Felix Miranda received death threats several times for
denouncing corruption in the Baja California state government while
the Institutional Revolutionary Party was in power.
   Ruffo, a member of the conservative National Action Party, was
elected last year and took office Dec. 1. He was the first
opposition candidate to be elected governor of a state in Mexico
since the Institutional Revolutionary Party came to power 61 years
ago.
   Vera Palestina is being held for trial in Tijuana, across the
border from San Ysidro, Calif., where he was arraigned Wednesday on
first-degree murder charges at the Baja California 2nd Criminal
Court, Ruffo said.
   Victoriano Medina, a former member of the state judicial police,
is also in a Tijuana jail awaiting trial in connection with the
slaying.
   Felix Miranda was the last of 30 Mexican journalists
assassinated during the previous six-year administration of
President Miguel de la Madrid.
   Zeta has offices in Tijuana and Mexicali.

   A rare white tiger was born among a
litter of three cubs at the Clyde Beatty Cole Brothers Circus, a
spokesman said Wednesday.
   Circus spokesman Jeff Chalmers said that the cub was born
Tuesday night. The mother and the litter were doing well, he said.
   The cub will stay with the circus for about two weeks until it
is weaned from the mother and then will be taken to a private
compound for care, Chalmers said.
   Ron Tilson, coordinator of a Siberian tiger species preservation
program, said white tigers are born once in about 4,000-5,000
births.
   All white tigers in North America can be traced to a single male
named Mohawk, and are the result of cross-breeding between Bengal
and Siberian tigers, said Tilson, who is director of conservation
at the Minnesota Zoo in Apple Valley, Minn.
   White tigers are white with brown stripes and blue eyes, but are
not albinos, Tilson added. He said there are at least 40 in North
America.

   Two U.S. Air Force crewmen ejected safely
Wednesday moments before their F111-F jet fighter crashed into a
wheat field in eastern England, the Air Force said.
   The jet was on a routine attack training mission when it crashed
near Binham, 120 miles northeast of London, said Air Force Master
Sgt. Michael Devine.
   Norfolk police said two buildings in the area were slightly
damaged by debris.
   Capt. David F. Ratcliffe, the pilot, and weapons systems
operator Lt. Brian W. Kirkwood were taken to their base hospital at
Lakenheath, a World War II Royal Air Force airfield 60 miles
northeast of London, the Air Force said. Their ages and hometowns
were not given.
   ``I understand one had a strained back, but that's all,'' said
Norfolk Police Inspector Ted Steward.
   Witnesses said the jet was flying very low just before it
crashed. Binham sub-postmaster George Bird said he saw ``a ball of
fire in the air.''
   An Air Force spokesman explained that the ball of fire was
probably caused by the rockets that eject the cockpit from the
plane. The Air Force said a board of officers would investigate the
crash.

<HEAD>Cable TV Regulation Won't Slow Cable Growth, Ted Turner Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cable television tycoon Ted Turner said
Wednesday more regulation of the industry doesn't necessarily mean
less growth.
   ``I don't see it as any sort of a serious threat,'' Turner told
a New York Television Academy luncheon.
   Turner asserted the real push for cable regulation is coming
from network broadcasters and phone companies, with the former
``trying to restrain cable any way they possibly can.''
   Virtually all cities with cable have had essentially no
regulation of cable systems since 1985 because a federal law that
generally freed local cable systems of rate regulation.
   But with some critics charging that cable has become an
unregulated monopoly, there now are proposals before Congress to
regulate the industry. According to A.C. Nielsen Co. estimates,
cable serves more than 57 percent of the nation's 92.1 million
homes with television.
   The National Cable Television Association, on whose board Turner
serves, said it will cooperate to work out an acceptable regulation
bill.
   But in Senate testimony in March, NCTA president James P. Mooney
warned that reregulation of cable rates would ``choke off'' funds
for programming and they would ``prefer'' the cable industry remain
unregulation.
   Turner, whose Turner Broadcasting System owns four cable
networks, including Cable News Network, said he spent considerable
time talking with key members of House and Senate subcommittees
about regulation proposals.
   ``So far, they haven't come up with anything that they think
they can get through at the current time,'' he said. ``But I don't
think it will slow cable up if they do. I don't think it will be
that bad if they do.
   ``So I'm not too worried about it. ... I don't see it as any
sort of a serious threat.''
   Turner also asserted the ratings of networks and broadcast
stations will decline and those of cable will climb. He predicted
that cable would be in 70 percent of the nation's households 2{
years from now.

<HEAD>Spy Ship Officer To Accept Heroism Medal 15 Years After Spurning
Award</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EL CAJON, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former No. 2 officer aboard the USS
Pueblo, who spurned a U.S. Navy heroism award 15 years ago, says
he'll accept a medal honoring him and other crewmen as prisoners of
war.
   Former Lt. Ed Murphy Jr. said he refused the Navy combat
commendation because other Pueblo crew members had not been
recognized for their heroism during 11 months of captivity in North
Korea in 1968.
   ``The reason I rejected the medal was that some other crew
members who deserved awards for heroism were not recommended,''
Murphy said.
   He said he changed his mind after the Defense Department decided
last month to bestow new U.S. prisoner-of-war medals to the crew.
He will accept that award this weekend to make peace with the Navy,
he said.
   Murphy won't receive the same medal he rejected, said Bob White,
director of San Diego County Veterans Services. ``We've never been
asked by Mr. Murphy to re-present that medal,'' he said.
   When the POW medal was authorized by Congress in 1988, the crew
of the USS Pueblo specifically was excluded from eligibility
because the United States was not engaged in an armed conflict with
North Korea when it seized the spy ship.
   A Pentagon legal adviser at the time ruled that the Pueblo crew
was merely detained, meaning they should not get the medal.
   Murphy, who lives in San Diego County, said 61 of the 82
surviving Pueblo crewmen so far have indicated they will attend the
POW medal presentation ceremony Saturday afternoon.
   He blamed the Pueblo's skipper, retired Navy Cmdr. Lloyd
``Pete'' Bucher, for deciding not to recommend other crew members
for the heroism medal. He and Bucher were at odds before the
seizure and during their captivity.
   ``I had to obey orders,'' Murphy said. ``If I had been in
command, I would have followed the course I recommended to Bucher _
get out of there at flank speed (about 25 mph).''
   Murphy is the Pueblo's most senior officer to be offered a
decoration for performance of duty as a North Korean POW.
   Navy officials say Bucher, the former commanding officer who
also lives in San Diego County, will receive the POW medal but not
a heroism award.
   The Pueblo was gathering intelligence about radar and other
defense installations on Jan. 23, 1968 when it was fired on by
North Korean naval vessels and captured in international waters.
One Pueblo sailor was killed.
   The crewmen were tortured and suffered public humiliation before
they were freed in December 1968.
   Despite a formal Navy court of inquiry, many questions remain
about the Koreans' motives for seizing the ship and why no U.S.
forces responded to calls for help before Bucher surrendered the
Pueblo and its crew.
   Bucher, Murphy and another Pueblo officer were recommended for
courts-martial at the time of the inquiry, but the move was vetoed
by John Chafee, then Secretary of the Navy.
   Bucher has accused the Navy of putting the ship in a dangerous
position and then failing to provide support.

   The television show ``America's Most Wanted'' will
broadcast a re-enactment of the theft of artworks from the Isabella
Stewart Gardner Museum, as part of the effort to solve the $200
million crime.
   At the urging of the FBI, museum officials allowed camera crews
on Monday to recreate the March 18 crime, using actors to play the
thieves and museum guards and enlarged photographs of the artwork
made from museum slides.
   The weekly series on the FOX network re-creates unsolved crimes
and provides telephone numbers for viewers to call in with tips.
   Anne Hawley, museum director, said the FBI has asked the museum
to cooperate ``in the hope that it would result in the return of
the stolen artwork.''
   John Kavanaugh, the segment's producer, said the FBI, police and
museum officials worked together to piece together details of the
crime in which two men posed as police officers, bound two museum
guards and made off with 13 works thought to be worth more than
$200 million.
   Composite drawings of both thieves will be shown during the
program, tentatively scheduled for broadcast May 13.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Visiting Czechoslovak government officials
said Wednesday they are appealing for U.S. help cleaning the
environment, including military sites polluted by departed Soviet
forces.
   Czechoslovakia has long realized that industrial waste made it
one of the world's worst polluted countries but an unexpected
problem has appeared at some of the sites occupied by the Soviet
Army since 1968, Deputy Prime Minister Petr Pithart told a news
conference.
   Environment Minister Bedrich Moldan said ``the big surprise was
... finding hydrocarbons, chemicals of unknown origin and
unprotected sewer systems that have polluted the ground and the
drinking water around the sites.''
   The wastes have not been fully analyzed and it is too early to
say whether they include any chemical warfare substances, he said
in answer to questions.
   Soviet forces have vacated three of 150 sites they occupied
since the 1968 Warsaw Pact intervention in Czechoslovakia, leaving
behind ripped up underground fuel tanks, craters covered with dirt
and gravel and pipelines feeding unidentified substances into
streams and waterways, Moldan said.
   Moldan said cleanup costs were estimated at $2.5 million per
site in a preliminary survey of a vacated Soviet military base at
Frenstat, Moravia, by Martech USA, an American company. He said
Martech is opening an office in Prague and forming a joint venture
with Geo Test, a Czechoslovak engineering enterprise.
   ``Martech officials tell us that the sites can be cleaned up to
meet your Environmental Protection standards but there is a great
deal of work to be done,'' he said. ``We need scrubbers and filters
to help clean up our air, we need to develop hazardous waste
storage sites and to clean up our waterways.''
   The ministers, members of Czechoslovakia's first democratic
government in more than 40 years, said officials of the U.S. State
Department and Environmental Protection Agency listened
sympathetically to their needs and would study the problems.

<HEAD>Protesters Back Down from Demand that President Resign</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 2,500 anti-government
demonstrators occupied a downtown square Wednesday for the eleventh
consecutive day and protest leaders softened their demands that
interim President Ion Iliescu resign.
   One of the protester's key demands is that the government adopt
a proposal excluding former Communists from politics.
   This would exclude Iliescu who held several high-ranking
positions in the early 1970's under deposed dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu. But Wednesday the rally organizers emphasized that
Iliescu was not the focus of their demands.
   ``It may not be too late for Iliescu to again represent the
interest of the people,'' said Mihai Lucian, a leader of one of the
protest groups.
   ``We initially supported Iliescu after the revolution, and our
main complaint against him now refers to what he has done since.''
   Porotests claim that Iliescu, one of the leaders of the December
revolution that deposed Ceausescu, has brought former Communists
into the government.
   At a press conference the leaders of the four groups that
organized the round-the-clock protests in University Square said
their demands included freeing radio and television from government
control, establishing a commission for ``cleansing'' the government
of former Communists and investigating police abuses.
   Opposition groups have repeatedly said that Iliescu's National
Salvation Front, which dominates the interim government, has an
unfair advantage in the May 20 national elections because the
government controls television and radio stations.
   On Monday five major opposition parties threatened to boycott
the elections accusing the National Salvation Front of monopolozing
power.
   On Tuesday, the government guarateed equal chances to all
parties contesting the elections and offered to meet with
opposition parties to discuss their criticisms.
   Protest organizers said they had received information that Vice
Prime Minister Gelu Voican-Voiculescu had ``expressed willingness''
to open a dialogue with them.
   Voican-Voiculescu could not be reached for comment, but
government spokesman Vasile Nastase said the government was ruling
out negotiations with the protesters.
   At University Square, protest leaders continued to collect
signatures for a proclamation calling for the exclusion of former
Communist functionaries from politics. They claim to have gathered
5 million signatures. The claim could not be independently verified.
   In another development, Roman Catholic nun and Nobel Peace Prize
winner Mother Theresa arrived in Bucharest Wednesday night for a
visit of undetermined length.

   Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene will plead
the cause of Lithuanian independence Thursday to President Bush
whose failure to penalize Moscow for an economic blockade was
decried by Lithuania's president as a second ``Munich.''
   ``The act of independence ... is untouchable,'' Mrs. Prunskiene
said Tuesday as she began her North American swing in Toronto,
Canada.
   Still, the prime minister's trip comes as Lithuanian leaders
signal a willingness to slow the independence drive in exchange for
an easing of the Kremlin's punishing economic blockade.
   In a letter to West German and French leaders, outlined
Wednesday to the parliament in Vilnius, Lithuanian President
Vytautas Landsbergis proposed that Western countries play a role in
proposed negotiations with the Kremlin.
   Landsbergis, in a separate letter released by Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato, R-N.Y., also said that ``the danger of violence or
provocations of some sort remains very real'' in his republic and
that shortages of consumer goods ``will eventually lead to unrest
in large segments of the population.''
   President Bush could help by heeding Congress' call for
diplomatic relations with Lithuania, he wrote. ``If this is still
not possible at the present moment, when will it become possible?
Under what conditions?''
   Bush, who has agreed to a low-key, non-official meeting with
Mrs. Prunskiene on Thursday, has urged the Soviets and the
Lithuanians to open a dialogue to resolve their differences.
   Bush on Wednesday proposed easing restrictions on sales of
sophisticated computers and other high tech products to the Soviet
Union and East Bloc. Just last week Bush decided to let trade talks
with the Soviets proceed despite the crackdown on Lithuania.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater defended the timing of
the latest move, saying it was dictated by the changes in Eastern
Europe as well as the Soviet Union, as well as pressure from
America's allies to east the restrictions.
   He said Bush remains ``very concerned'' about the Lithuanian
crisis. The U.S.-Soviet trade talks ``are progressing,'' Fitzwater
said, ``but it's still an open question.''
   On Tuesday Fitzwater said Bush was meeting with Mrs. Prunskiene
not as prime minister of an independent Lithuania but rather as
``an acknowledged and freely elected representative of the
Lithuanian people.''
   Mrs. Prunskiene, who arrived Wednesday evening in Washington, is
also scheduled to meet with congressional leaders and with ranking
State Department officials and to testify at a public hearing of
the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Helsinki
Commission.
   Before leaving Toronto for Washington, she met with Canadian
business leaders to lay a foundation for future trade agreements
with Canada.
   She declined to identify the companies represented, but said,
``They are very substantial of all types and sizes and the meetings
with them have been truly substantial and productive ones.''
   Bush has declined to recognize the republic's independence
before it achieves control over its territory and institutions.
Lithuania and two other Baltic republics were forcibly incorporated
into the Soviet Union in 1940.
   Bush has also deferred a decision on sanctions against the
Kremlin in the Lithuanian dispute in order to avoid both increasing
the political pressure on Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and
complicating the prospect for talks.
   Lithuanian President Landsbergis initially called Bush's
decision a political ``Munich,'' a disparaging comparison to the
bid by Britain and France in 1938 to appease Nazi Germany at the
expense of Czechoslovakia.
   Landsbergis told the Lithuanian parliament on Wednesday that he
was pleased Bush would meet with Mrs. Prunskiene and added:
   ``We hope that Mrs. Prunskiene will more completely inform
President Bush about the situation in Lithuania in the days of
blockade.''
   Gorbachev has declared the March 11 declaration of independence
by Lithuania's parliament invalid and illegal under the Soviet
Constitution and has said there can be no dialogue until it is
rescinded.
   In Toronto on Tuesday, Mrs. Prunskiene said that the cities of
Moscow and Leningrad have agreed to help Lithuania ease the
pressure of the Soviet embargo.
   She did not say exactly what assistance was offered. But
Lithuania sent a delegation to Leningrad last week to explore a
possible direct exchange of goods either for hard currency or
barter.
   Mrs. Prunskiene told reporters that reform municipal councils in
Leningrad, Moscow and elsewhere in the Soviet Union offered to
assist Lithuania ``because they receive many of their food supplies
from us.''

<HEAD>Campaign Launched for U.S. Infrastructure Restoration</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sponsors of a nationwide ``town meeting''
radio broadcast Wednesday night urged that savings from the end of
the cold war be used to restore American roads, bridges, schools
and other deteriorating infrastructure rather than merely helping
to reduce the federal deficit.
   Concrete planning for conversion from a military-driven to a
civilian economy will be needed to restore the United States as a
first-class industrial country, they said.
   The message was being aired at simultaneous meetings in 64
cities Wednesday, followed by the two-hour broadcast over more than
30 radio stations from coast to coast, said Jonathan Feldman,
spokesman of the National Commission for Economic Conversion and
Disarmament, a private advocacy group.
   Author Studs Terkel was moderator of the program, which
scheduled appearances by political and civic leaders including New
York Mayor David Dinkins, Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste, the Rev. Jesse
Jackson, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Claiborne
Pell, D-R.I., former Democratic presidential candidate George
McGovern, Southwestern Bell Finance Director Susan Fox and George
Korpius, president of the Machinists Union.
   Commission Chairman Seymour Melman, economist and retired
Columbia University industrial engineering professor, has long
argued that military spending was bleeding the United States of the
resources needed for roads, schools, housing and other investments.
   Melman, 72, has been saying in lectures, articles and interviews
that by the end of the 1970s the United States was no longer a
first-class industrial economy by virtue of investing a smaller
proportion of gross national product in its civilian economy than
European countries or Japan.
   ``Some voice the opinion that whatever savings accrue from a
military wind-down should be used only to reduce the size of the
federal debt,'' he said in a New York Times article last December.
``That is a sure vote for a third-rate economy,'' he added.

<HEAD>Attorney for Bus Driver Accused in Shootings Says He Was
Frustrated</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA MYERS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A city bus driver accused of shooting one
person to death and wounding three others was frustrated with his
job and angry at police for failing to capture his daughter's
attacker, his attorney said Wednesday.
   Paul Bellazain, 46, was charged with two counts of attempted
murder in the wounding of two police officers in Daly City, a
southern suburb, on Tuesday. He had not been charged by Wednesday
night in the random fatal shooting of a bicyclist and the wounding
of a motorist the same day in San Francisco.
   On Tuesday morning, the gunman cruised Interstate 280 and side
streets in San Francisco, killing a bicyclist at McLaren Park and
firing at cars during a 45-minute morning rampage that finally
ended in a shootout with police outside crowded Westlake Shopping
Center in Daly City.
   Bellazain, who was shot in the thigh by police and then tackled,
was listed in good condition under police guard at San Mateo County
Hospital Wednesday.
   Attorney Melvin Belli said Bellazain, a municipal bus driver on
disability for a hand injury the past five months, had been
scheduled to be in his office Tuesday to give a deposition.
Bellazain had filed a civil lawsuit in connection with the January
1988 drive-by shooting of his daughter, Shari, then 17, who lost a
kidney and part of her intestine.
   ``He got the days mixed up so he came over here the day before
the shooting,'' Belli said. ``He seemed OK, but a little upset. ...
I think he was upset with the police system because they were
unable to locate the person who shot his daughter.''
   Bellazain filed a civil suit against the owner of the Rolladium
Roller Rink in San Mateo where his daughter was shot. He claims
rink employees didn't let his daughter inside when she sought help.
   Bellazain was also frustrated because he had been unable to get
early disability retirement for a 1988 back injury, Belli said. The
former bus driver union president, who recently lost a re-election
bid, was removed from his post in 1981 after he allegedly hit
another driver with a pool cue.
   The dead man in Tuesday's shootings was identified as James
Vaszko, 43, of San Francisco, a copy editor at the San Francisco
Examiner.
   The motorist, James Neumann, 41, of San Francisco, remained in
serious condition at San Francisco General Hospital, suffering from
shotgun wounds he received in his arm and chest while traveling on
I-280.
   Officer Gary Smith, who tackled Bellazain and was injured in the
left arm by a .38-caliber handgun, was in good condition at Seton
Medical Center. Daly City Police spokesman Jim McHenry said Smith
was being considered for a commendation for heroism.
   The second officer, Sgt. Ralph Warren, was released from Seton
Wednesday following treatment for a gunshot wound to his left arm.
   ``There were quite a few rounds fired,'' said McHenry, who
estimated that the gunman spent up to 20 shells. ``This guy was
cranking off rounds with several weapons.''
   Officers recovered a shotgun, rifle and .38-caliber pistol from
Bellazain.
   Before the Daly City shootout, Bellazain held chiropractor Gene
Martin and his receptionist hostage, Martin said. Bellazain told
them he wanted to get back at police because they were
investigating him for allegedly molesting his children, the
hostages said.
   He told his hostages he was ``sick of the system, knew he was
going to die and wanted to take some cops with him,'' they reported.
   Bellazain's daughters, who have been living with him for the
past few years, had called a Seton Medical Center crisis center
before the rampage began at 8:56 a.m. No one was home when Daly
City police arrived after 9 a.m. By then, the shooting had begun.
   Bellazain told police last week he was going to check himself
into a mental health center, said San Francisco police Capt. Bob
Fife.

<HEAD>Oregon Panel Working on Limiting Medicaid Coverage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A panel has completed a ranking of 3,000
medical treatments that health officials said Wednesday will be
used to help the state decide what operations are to be eliminated
from Medicaid in the future.
   Oregon is the first state in the country to consider limiting
the types of treatments that will be paid for by Medicaid.
   Officials said skyrocketing medical costs have forced the state
to make a choice: Either reduce the pool of those who can receive
Medicaid, or stop payment on certain expensive treatments, like
transplants. It has chosen the latter.
   The Health Services Commission compiled a 167-page list of of
3,000 medical treatments ranked under a cost-benefit formula that
divides the cost of the procedure by the benefit in years of life
and improvement of life.
   The commission and a panel called Oregon Health Decision
developed the list after holding 11 public hearings, 50 community
meetings, and telephone interviews to find out which illnesses
Oregonians fear the most.
   Over the next two weeks, the committee will weigh aspects such
as quality of life, personal choice and the community's sense of
compassion, said Paige Sipes-Metzler, chairwoman of the 11-member
panel. On May 15, it will factor together these criteria with the
cost-benefit analysis to make a final list.
   Under the current Medicaid system, the number of people who are
eligible depends on the amount of money that is available to treat
them. When money gets tight, the state rewrites its eligibility
requirements, knocking more people off the Medicaid list. Those who
are left, generally the poorest, enjoy a relatively rich package of
benefits.
   The new program, while eliminating some services, would add
about 77,000 Oregonians to basic Medicaid rolls that now number
about 130,000, officials said.
   The bottom line on which treatments are excluded from Medicaid
will be made by the Legislature in January. Among the most likely
procedures are transplants, which can run into hundreds of
thousands of dollars.
   Oregon must get permission from the federal government to modify
its Medicaid program before it can implement the program.
   The changes were proposed by state Senate President John
Kitzhaber, who is an emergency room physician.
   In 1987, the Legislature halted Medicaid funding for most organ
transplants, using the money for other health needs such as
prenatal care. Only two other states, Virginia and Arizona, exclude
transplants from Medicaid.
   Congress designed Medicaid to provide health care to the poor,
but medical costs have forced states to adjust their eligibility
standards to exclude many poor people.
   Other states are watching Oregon's program to see if they can
adapt aspects ot it. U.S. health-care spending this year is
expected to exceed $600 billion, about 12 percent of the gross
national product, up from 7 percent in 1970, officials say.
   About 31.5 million people in the United States have neither
health insurance nor Medicaid coverage, according to the Census
Bureau.

<HEAD>Federal Appeals Panel Upholds Constitutionality of Illinois Death
Penalty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STANLEY D. MILLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Wednesday upheld the
constitutionality of Illinois' death penalty statute, striking down
the earlier ruling of a federal judge.
   The three-member 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the
decision of U.S. District Judge Harold Baker, who had ruled in 1989
that the state's death penalty was unconstitutional on the grounds
that it allowed prosecutors too much leeway on whether to seek
capital punishment.
   Some 120 men are on death row in Illinois. Among them is John W.
Gacy, convicted of killing 33 young men and boys in the worst
multiple-killing case in U.S. history. Because of prolonged
appeals, no one has been executed under the 1977 statute.
   Attorneys for convicted double murderer Charles Silagy had
challenged the constitutionality of the law, saying their handling
of the case was hampered by not knowing whether prosecutors would
seek the death penalty.
   The Illinois attorney general's office asked the federal appeals
court in January to overturn Baker's ruling.
   The 53-page decision Wednesday by Judges Michael Kanne, John
Coffey and Frank Easterbrook was the first time the federal appeals
panel has ruled specifically on the current Illinois death penalty
law.
   It rejected Baker's contention that state laws allowed
prosecutors to be ``arbitrary and capricious'' and thereby hindered
defense attorneys.
   ``We do not agree,'' wrote Kanne in the appellate decision.
   Instead, the law ``permits the prosecutor to weigh all of the
evidence,'' Kanne wrote, ``in his assessment of the propriety of
seeking the death penalty.''
   Although Illinois prosecutors can wait until after a conviction
to announce whether they will seek the death penalty, they still
have to prove the case warrants capital punishment, Kanne said.
   Assistant Illinois Attorney General Jack Donatelli argued before
the appeals court in January that the state statute was neither
arbitrary nor capricious, but is specific about who is eligible for
the death penalty and includes safeguards meant to correct any
mistakes an overzealous prosecutor might make.
   Wednesday's decision came two days after the U.S. Supreme Court
cleared the way for the execution of convicted murderer Charles
Walker by ruling that five people who initiated a challenge to
Walker's death sentence had no standing in the case.
   Walker, sentenced to die in 1983 after he pleaded guilty to
killing Sharon Winker and Kevin Paule in southern Illinois' St.
Clair County, stands at the top of the list of the state's
death-row inmates.
   Walker has said he wants to die and has abandoned all appeals.
The Illinois Supreme Court has yet to set Walker's execution date.

<HEAD>Brazilian Army Dynamites Clandestine Airstrips in Amazon Jungle</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Wednesday began
dynamiting the first of 110 clandestine airstrips cut by gold
miners on Amazon jungle lands inhabited by the Yanomami Indians,
the world's largest primitive tribe.
   More than 250 army soldiers, air force officials and federal
police blew up the first airstrip Wednesday, a 600-yard runway in
the tropical rain forest near the Venezuelan and Guyanan borders.
   The military used 374 pounds of explosives to blast open 40
holes, each 13 feet in diameter and four feet deep, said Federal
Police spokesman Joao Martins.
   The rest of the airstrips will be destroyed before May 18 to
prevent the 40,000 prospectors from returning to Indian lands,
Martins said in a telephone interview.
   He said the work will cost $800,000.
   President Fernando Collor de Mello ordered the destruction of
the airstrips following a visit to the Yanomami reservation soon
after he took office on March 15.
   In addition to evacuating the miners, who first invaded the 1
million acre reserve in 1987, Collor promised to blow up the
illegal landing strips to stop planes from supplying the miners and
transporting gold and diamonds.
   Martins said two airstrips will be left intact for the National
Indian Foundation and the army, which maintains border outposts in
the region to combat drug trafficking and smuggling along Brazil's
4,000-mile northern frontier.
   He said troops seized one small plane loaded with cocaine on the
airstrip just before the dynamiting operation began. Police say
drug traffickers used the clandestine airstrips as transhipment
points between Colombia and Bolivia.
   The rush to Yanomami territory began three years ago after
government studies revealed the presence of gold, diamonds, tin and
bauxite in the region.
   Prospectors flocked to the area, leveling rain forests, chasing
off fish and game, polluting rivers with mercury used in gold
panning and spreading diseases previously unknown to the isolated
tribe.
   Since 1987, the tribe has dwindled from about 9,000 to 7,500,
due to malnutrition, venereal diseases and malaria. Others have
been killed in clashes with miners.
   Under international pressure, the government of former President
Jose Sarney announced a $4 million campaign in early January to
expel the prospectors, by force if necessary.
   There are about 220,000 native Indians left in Brazil, down from
an estimated 5 million when the Portuguese first landed here in
1500.
   The government has been steadily carving up Indian lands,
leaving the Yanomamis 19 scattered reservations totaling 5 million
acres in Brazil's northwest Amazon territory.

   The House voted Wednesday to limit the federal
government's spending on the super collider atom smasher to $5
billion.
   Current Energy Department estimates of the ultimate cost of the
collider range up to $8 billion.
   The bill, approved 309-109 and sent to the Senate, gives the
department specific authority to build the particle accelerator.
   Since the department already could undertake the project under
other general authority to support scientific research, the
specific authority is important mostly as a sign of political
support.
   The collider, a 54-miles-around tunnel in which beams of protons
will smash together to explore the secrets of matter, will be the
largest scientific instrument ever built. It is planned for a site
about 30 miles south of Dallas.
   Under the legislation approved Wednesday, costs above $5 billion
would be left to Texas, which has pledged $1 billion, and other
sources, including foreign contributors.
   The Energy Department did not mention the spending limit in a
statement by Deputy Secretary Henson Moore welcoming the House
action as an ``important victory.''
   ``We are pleased with the 3-1 margin which demonstrates support
in Congress for this exciting project,'' said Moore.
   Actual spending must be approved in annual congressional
appropriations. The Bush administration sought spending authority
of $318 million for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, up $100
million from the current year.
   Robert Roe, D-N.J., chairman of the Science, Space and
Technology Committee said the five-year authorization gives the
collider ``the stability and continuity that it needs to flourish.''
   But much of the afternoon's debate on the bill centered on
making sure the federal share would not rise if the total cost of
the project did.
   ``When the House votes for this legislation today, it is going
on record that the SSC will not cost the taxpayer one dime more
than $5 billion,'' said Rep. Robert Walker, R-Pa., the ranking
minority member of the Science, Space and Technology Committee.

   A guard accidentally shot and killed
a presidential palace employee during a training exercise, a
spokesman said Wednesday.
   The incident set off rumors of a coup against President
Guillermo Endara, now visiting the United States, but palace
spokesman Rene Hernandez denied the allegations.
   Cabinet Minister Julio Harris also denied the rumors: ``There
were a series of rumors and speculations concerning unusual
movements at the Las Garzas Palace, but these were due to training
exercises by the presidential guard.''
   Hernandez told reporters Jose Cubilla, 23, was accidentally shot
several times by a palace guard during training maneuvers by the
president's security detail. Cubilla died soon after the incident.
   Endara is expected back in Panama City on Thursday.
   Endara was sworn in as president on Dec. 19, hours before U.S.
forces invaded Panama to oust dictator Manuel Noriega.
   Endara oppposed Noriega in elections last May but results of the
balloting were annulled by Noriega.

<TEXT>
   A jury Wednesday threw out a negligence
lawsuit by the widow of a Hollywood stuntman who died after
plunging off an embankment on a motorcycle during the making of a
film.
   The jury, after seven weeks of testimony, decided that the film
producers, Dino De Laurentiis Productions, DEG, De Laurentiis Film
Partners and Productions Ltd., could not be held responsible for
Dar Robinson's death during the 1986 filming of ``Million Dollar
Mystery.''
   Linda Robinson burst into tears after the separate verdicts for
each company were announced. She said outside court that she would
continue to pursue the case.
   ``I had just hoped this would be the end,'' she sobbed. ``This
was the final burying of my husband for me. Now I can see it's
going to be a long time. That's the injustice of it.''
   ``It's a really sad thing,'' said juror Linda Burrow. ``Somebody
died and it's really sad, and we did feel there was some
responsibility on the part of `Million Dollar Mystery.'''
   But Ms. Burrow said the legal instructions given to the jury
gave them ``no choice'' but to find for the defendants.
   Mrs. Robinson's lawyer, Jerry Kroll, maintained that Robinson
died because an ambulance was not available at the remote desert
location where he was filming ``Million Dollar Mystery'' on Nov.
21, 1986.
   The attorney said it took two hours to get Robinson to the
nearest hospital after his motorcycle ran off U.S. Highway 89A and
he fell down a 40-foot embankment. Robinson, 39, suffered massive
internal injuries.
   During the trial, Kroll called movie stars Danny Glover and Burt
Reynolds to testify about Robinson's reputation as a top stuntman
and about safety on the sets where he worked.
   ``The evidence was overwhelming that DEG and the other
defendants were negligent,'' Kroll said.
   Attorneys for DEG and Productions Ltd. argued that there was no
ambulance on the set because Robinson felt it was ``bad luck'' and
an insult to his stunt abilities to have one around.
   Attorney John Hager, who represented Delaurentiis, DEG and Film
Partners, said, said his clients had offered ``a significant
settlement'' to Mrs. Robinson before trial but it was rejected.
   Attorney Joe Deems, who represented Productions Ltd., said the
company followed Screen Actors Guilty rules for safety and ``they
are sound rules.''

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The families of a British and an Irish captive in
Lebanon got word from freed U.S. hostage Frank Reed on Wednesday
that the two are alive and well, the first concrete assurance they
had received since the 1986 abductions.
   Reed told reporters in Wiesbaden, West Germany, he had been with
Briton John McCarthy and Brian Keenan, a dual Anglo-Irish citizen,
since October. He phoned a hostage group in Britain to report he
saw them Saturday, two days before he was freed.
   Reed telephoned McCarthy's father, Pat, and McCarthy's friend,
Jill Morrell, and said, ``They are both well. They have some minor
health problems. They exercise daily and read voraciously,'' the
group said.
   Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie said he was encouraged,
even though Reed had no news of Terry Waite, the Anglican leader's
envoy. Waite disappeared Jan. 20, 1987, after leaving his Beirut
hotel to negotiate with Islamic Jihad for the release of U.S.
hostages.
   No group claimed to hold him, but Waite, 50, is widely believed
held by Islamic Jihad.
   Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd told reporters before flying to
Brussels Wednesday night he hoped the release of Reed and fellow
American Robert Polhill last week ``is part of a movement which
will get them all out.''
   ``I shall be talking to James Baker, the American secreary of
state, and comparing notes with him in the morning in Brussels,''
he said.
   Joan Willows, a spokeswoman for the group, the Friends of John
McCarthy, said: ``Mr. Reed said John had grown a beard and keeps
fit by performing squat thrusts and press-ups (push-ups), and as
far as his captors could be they are quite good. He is not being
tortured.''
   Ms. Morrell said on BBC radio that Reed told her McCarthy, 33,
was aware of the campaign for his release ``and was getting the
messages that we put to him in the newspaper in Beirut.''
   ``It's just the best thing I've heard in four years. It's
amazing,'' she said.
   She told Independent Television News after talking to Reed:
``They are chained and blindfolded most of the time _ chained to a
radiator apart from this period in the morning when they can
exercise in the room.''
   McCarthy, a journalist for the Worldwide Television News agency
of London, was kidnapped April 17, 1986, as he drove to Beirut
Airport to leave Lebanon.
   Keenan, 39, is from Belfast in British-ruled Northern Ireland.
An English-language teacher at the American University in Beirut,
he disappeared while walking to work April 11, 1986. He was
traveling on an Irish passport.
   No group has claimed to be holding either man.
   Other missing Britons are Jack Mann, 75, an ex-pilot who
disappeared in west Beirut a year ago, and Alec Collett, 68, a New
York-based journalist on assignment for the United Nations Relief
and Works Agency, who was kidnapped March 25, 1985.
   Six Americans, an Italian, two West Germans and two Swiss also
are believed held captive. The longest held, Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press, was kidnapped on
March 16, 1985.

   The Senate, upset over President Bush's
decision not to punish the Soviet Union for its actions in
Lithuania, is urging him to put the brakes on a new U.S.-Soviet
trade agreement.
   By a 73-24 vote, the Senate passed a resolution Tuesday seeking
a halt to any trade agreement that would grant the Soviet Union
lower tariffs as long as the crackdown on Lithuania continues.
   The non-binding resolution urges Bush not to act on any trade
agreements until the Soviets lift their economic blockade against
Lithuania and enter into negotiations aimed at independence for the
republic.
   In a political twist, the measure was introduced by a fellow
Republican _ Sen. Alfonse D'Amato of New York _ and supported by
most GOP senators. Only Republican Sens. John Warner of Virginia
and Alan Simpson of Wyoming voted against the measure.

<HEAD>Baptist Futurist Sees Fluid Religious Atmosphere Ahead</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Looking ahead, Baptist specialists on other
faiths see a changed American religious environment coming, an
atmosphere of floating allegiances, blending of practices and
greater variety.
   At the same time, Protestant denominations were seen as becoming
more and more alike, with distinctions fading and a casual flow of
memberships among them.
   ``In the future we're going to see less loyalty to a particular
denomination and more fuzziness between denominations,'' said Gary
Leazer, an interfaith officer of the Southern Baptist Home Missions
Board.
   ``Individuals will increasingly feel free to construct their own
worldview from many options present in society rather than being
bound by the orthodoxy of their particular faith.''
   Leazer was among three leaders of the denomination's interfaith
witness department addressing a recent conference on the
chaplaincy, long a field that demands working among mixed religious
outlooks.
   He told the conference at Golden Gate Theological Seminary in
Mill Valley, Calif., that people increasingly will take the
attitude of ``religious consumers'' and shop around for
denominations and religions.
   ``If one denomination does not offer a particular item, people
will go to another faith to find it,'' he said.
   Leazer said the mega-trend of pluralism will further swell the
shifting of members among denominations. Already, Gallup poll
statistics show a whopping increase in that phenomenon.
   For example, in 1955, only one in 24 Americans left the faith of
childhood to join another denomination, but by 1985, that migration
had grown to one in three _ a third of all members.
   Concurrent with that trend, Leazer said denominations are
becoming more alike, as differences in educational and economic
status of members narrow. Closer ecumenical relations also
furthered that process.
   Although Southern Baptists have remained formally outside the
major ecumenical bodies, other denominations for years have
discussed doctrinal emphases and practices for greater
understanding and mutual enrichment.
   As a consequence, worship of the different denominations has
become more alike, including that of major Protestant denominations
and Roman Catholics. In some cases, close attention is needed to
tell them apart.
   Some formerly non-liturgical churches have gradually become more
liturgical, and some once formally liturgical churches have added
freer, spontaneous notes, making for greater resemblance.
   Leazer, director of the Home Mission Board's interfaith witness
department, said formerly regional denominations also are moving
into new areas, including the Southern Baptist expansion outside
the Bible Belt into all 50 states.
   At the same time, he noted that Roman Catholics have grown
immensely within the Bible Belt, a region where they once were few.
   Leazer said the biggest challenge to Christians in the decade
ahead will come from the New Age movement, a mix of pantheism,
self-enhancement techniques and occult spirituality, and from Islam.
   Islam will become part of the nation's religious establishment,
along with Judaism and Christianity, he said.
   Currently, he said there are about 4.l7 million Moslems in
America, but that about 4,000 Americans, mostly blacks, join Islam
each year, plus Moslem immigrants. Presently there are about 5.9
million U.S. Jews.
   Leazer also said Eastern religions and occult spirituality will
tend to become mainstream, gaining more acceptance in society,
their influence felt in the churches.
   ``People will go to a study group on Hinduism on Friday night
and then come to church on Sunday and try to interject those ideas
into Bible study,'' he said.
   He said New Age ideas ``will continue to influence the way
Americans think and do religion.''
   He also foresaw a splurge of end-of-time prophecies as the end
of the century nears.
   For many Southern Baptists, cooperating ``with people of other
religions is one of the most difficult responses to religious
pluralism,'' Leazer said, but added:
   ``You cannot demand the right to be heard by people of other
faiths. Interfaith witness allows you to build relationship with
people so they will listen to your gospel.''

<HEAD>US-Japan Trade Issue Has Makings of GOP Trouble</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conservative Republicans are keeping a wary
watch on the Japan trade issue, a sleeper some think could awaken
and hurt them.
   It is complex, contentious, delicate and yet deceptively simple
when boiled into the shorthand of campaign politics. That volatile
mix came up earlier this year at a forum on the Republican future,
where campaign consultants agreed that it has the makings of GOP
trouble.
   ``A George Wallace-type Democrat could have a field day with the
issue,'' said Kevin Phillips of the American Political Report.
   Paul Weyrich of the Free Congress Foundation said a national
candidate who made effective use of trade problems and
protectionism could come on strong in a future presidential
campaign. Japan-bashing sells, he said. ``It sounds macho.''
   Rep. Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, now the House majority
leader, tried it as a presidential candidate in 1988 and flopped.
Gephardt thinks trade barriers, and Japan in particular, might be a
more potent issue now.
   After long, intense negotiations that produced Japanese
agreement to open its markets more widely to U.S. supercomputers,
lumber and commercial satellites, with the promise of more to come,
the aministration dropped the Japanese from its list of countries
with trade barriers that pose problems.
   Under the 1988 trade act, the government annually lists
countries it considers to have unfair trade practices against U.S.
exports. That is supposed to lead to negotiations on affected
industries and products, with the threat of sanctions if the
offending practices are not changed.
   The new list _ a short one; India is the only country left _
produced immediate protests in Congress and a Senate proposal to
take away the president's authority over the process. The measure
would require that the target list include any country accounting
for more than 15 percent of the U.S. international trade deficit, a
description that fits only Japan.
   The United States ran a $49 billion deficit with Japan in 1989,
accounting for 45 percent of the total trade imbalance.
   President Bush said Monday that dropping Japan from the priority
negotiation list didn't mean the trade problem has been resolved.
``We know that we could sell more American product if Japan's
markets were truly open,'' he told the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
``But we've been working hard on that, and I think with impressive
results.
   ``Over the past few months, we have made more progress on trade
issues with Japan than at any other time I can recall,'' he said.
``Now we are going to continue to press for progress.''
   Bush told the businessmen if that doesn't happen, he still has
the target list and other options ``to open markets and ensure fair
treatment for American products, services, American investment and
ideas.''
   He said his top priority is to negotiate a strengthening of the
general agreement on tariffs and trade, in talks with a December
deadline aimed at opening markets in nearly 100 countries. The
talks are being held under the auspices of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.
   ``We've got to strengthen GATT as a matter of principle, as a
sign to the emerging democracies in eastern Europe and in this
hemisphere that free trade is the wave of the future,'' Bush said.
   Politically, though, and therefore in Congress, there seems to
be more interest in staying mad and trying to get even. ``Our
hackles get up,'' said Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W. Va., one of the
sponsors of the target list system, after the administration
dropped Japan from the list.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, chairman of the Finance Committee
and a potential Democratic challenger to Bush in 1992, said after
the U.S.-Japan trade agreement was reached late last month that
prior deals have produced scant results. ``We thought we came home
with the so-called silver bullet agreement and we finally found out
we were firing blanks,'' he said.
   ``Results are what counts, not just agreements,'' Byrd told the
Senate on Friday.
   Then he put the case in terms that may be heard again from
political platforms:
   ``The technology that the Japanese use so well in many instances
originates here, in the United States. We develop the technology
... with our very fine American brains, and then the Japanese pick
up the technology and they commercialize it and they outsell us...
   ``My mind boggles with admiration for the Japanese, their
ingenuity, their resourcefulness,'' he said. ``They just take our
trade negotiators' shirts, and that has been the case for a long
time.''

   Whoa, somebody reign in the critics. They're
out of control.
   NBC's ``Shannon's Deal'' needs an ace in the hole. In last
week's Nielsen Co. ratings, it cashed in at No. 52.
   But you'd never know it by the reviews.
   ``You gotta love a lawyer with a screwball mojo attitude,''
raved Mike Duffy of the Detroit Free Press. ``The show appears
bound for glory,'' enthused Barry Garron of The Kansas City (Mo.)
Star. ``Don't miss `Shannon's Deal,''' said David Zurawik of The
Evening Sun of Baltimore.
   Why such a big deal about ``Shannon's Deal?''
   Maybe it's because the show's creator is
novelist-screenwriter-filmmaker John Sayles (``Return of the
Secaucus 7,'' ``Baby, It's You,'' ``Matewan'' and ``Eight Men
Out''). Maybe it's because Grammy-winner Wynton Marsalis does the
show's jazz score.
   Perhaps it's because ``Shannon's Deal'' is just plain peculiar.
   The down-and-out protagonist, Jack Shannon (played by Jamey
Sheridan) is a disillusioned corporate attorney who leaves big
business _ and hopefully, his gambling addiction _ to hang out his
shingle in a blue-collar Philadelphia neighborhood.
   Life is not easy for Shannon, who has bad guys on his trail
trying to collect gambling debts. He also has a teen-age daughter
he feels guilty about not spending enough time with.
   He runs around saying things like: ``If I told you the truth,
I'd be a hypocrite. I never lie.''
   Go figure.
   In a recent episode titled ``Words to Music,'' an unknown
songwriter comes to Shannon claiming a country music star has
stolen her song.
   Sample weirdness:
   _ Rock star David Crosby sitting in an abandoned swimming pool
shooting empty bottles.
   _ Sayles playing a crazed redneck whose gait looked as if he had
just finished a two-day cattle drive.
   _ And the unknown songstress uttering the immortal line, ``I'm
about to split a gut. Is there a bathroom in here?''
   Weaving in and out of the show was a collection of background
music that included ``Me and Mrs. Jones,'' ``At Smokey Joe's Cafe''
and ``If You Don't Know Me by Now.''
   The making of ``Shannon's Deal'' is almost as odd as the show
itself.
   Sayles (as writer) did two episodes and the two-hour pilot,
shown April 13. Then he left.
   ``Right now I'm just watching it,'' Sayles said from New Jersey,
where he is scouting locations for a new feature film. ``This is
something I always kind of planned on. My idea was, `Let's see if I
can start the ball rolling and step away.'''
   So Sayles and executive producer Stan Rogow offered the jobs of
writer and director as cameo roles. Tom Rickman, who wrote ``Coal
Miner's Daughter,'' has done an episode. So has the co-writer and
director of ``The Razor's Edge,'' John Byrum.
   There's another oddity in the hour-long series at 10 p.m. on
Mondays. In a show about an attorney, there is never a courtroom
scene.
   Sayles said he wanted to focus instead on ``the amount of law
that was done outside of court and how much it is like a poker game
_ the plays, the bluffs, knowing when to fold and how long to stay
at the table.''
   This is not the first time Sayles, 39, has tried television. In
1980, he wrote ``A Perfect Match,'' about a woman with a mysterious
illness who must locate the daughter she gave up for adoption.
   The 1986 TV movie ``Unnatural Causes,'' also written by Sayles,
depicted a dedicated Veterans Administration benefits counselor
struggling to link Agent Orange with a patient's illness.
   Does Sayles like the little screen?
   ``It's a good place to work if you can pick your spots.''

   A Pentecostal pastor and his typically
exuberant Pentecostal congregation, the Church of Christ the King,
have joined a formally liturgical denomination, the Episcopal
Church.
   That blending of ``charismatic expressiveness and high-church
dignity'' was celebrated April l5 in a ``dynamic synergism'' of
both that ``inspired standing ovations and joyous praise,''
reported The Ledger-Enquirer of Columbus.
   ``Flanking a procession of miters and copes and incense were
jean-clad couples beating tambourines and young men scissor-kicking

   The Pentecostal pastor, the Rev. Stan White, seeking deeper

pastor, the Rev. Jacoba Hurst of nearby Tifton, and Georgia's
Bishop Harry Shipps.

``to put your fire into the Episcopal Church's fireplace. May you

<HEAD>Bishops Criticize Vatican Catechism Draft</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of U.S. Roman Catholic bishops have sharply criticized a
proposed ``universal catechism'' prepared by the Vatican, calling
parts of it unbalanced, out of context and superficial.
   It's supposed to be a guiding summary of faith, but ``reads too
much like an encyclopedia,'' the bishops say. It ``needs a more
positive spirit'' and ``should inspire as well as inform.''
   Yet sometimes even the information is distorted, the bishops
say, such as in instances implying consensus when ``consensus is in
fact lacking.''
   The proposed document is the first attempt at a church-wide
doctrinal compilation since 1566 and is regarded as the most
significant project of the world's bishops since the Second Vatican
Council of 1962-65.
   A fundamental problem with the draft is failure to differentiate
adequately between essential and secondary teachings, U.S. bishops
say. ``The lack of such distinctions ... can lead to serious
misunderstanding.''
   The bishops say the 434-page document misuses Bible quotations
in a ``proof-text'' manner, subordinates the role of the laity,
discounts ecumenical ties with other churches and oversimplifies
some concepts.
   ``Those familiar with the complexity of the issues will judge
the catechism superficial and may be led to think the same of
Catholic doctrine,'' the bishops say.
   They also say the proposed title, ``Catechism for the Universal
Church'' is inappropriate and confusing, since the document is not
meant to be a catechism itself but a doctrinal guide for producing
regional catechisms.
   A substitute title is recommended, namely: ``A Compendium of
Catholic Doctrine for the Preparation of Catechisms.''
   A commission headed by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, chief of the
Vatican's doctrinal office, drew up the proposed document at the
behest of a 1985 international synod of bishops.
   The draft was distributed ``sub secreto'' (under secrecy) last
December to the world's 2,500 bishops, asking their reactions by
May 31.
   ``The time alloted for consultation is insufficient,'' the U.S.
bishops say in their 51-page critique, asking that the period be
extended, and that later a a second draft be subjected to further
feedback.
   The analysis was prepared by a six-bishop review committee
headed by Bishop Oscar H. Lipscomb of Mobile, Ala., in consultation
with 30 other experts, and relayed by the bishops' conference to
the Vatican.
   Individual bishops also were expected to send in their own
assessments.
   The joint response says the proposed document ignores
contemporary biblical scholarship and principles of interpretation
and uses New Testmanet texts out of context in support of
particular points.
   ``Such an approach would be highly detrimental to catechetical
and theological practice,'' the bishops say.
   ``This defect works itself out in a deleterious fashion
throughout the catechism ... various quotations from Scripture are
cited in a `proof-text' manner without regard for their proper
meaning within their proper context.''
   The bishops also say the document tends to equate central and
marginal teachings, saying:
   ``The text presents doctrines that are not fully certain and are
peripheral to the faith (such as about angels and Christ's descent
into hell) on the same level as central and certain and defined
truth,'' the bishops say.
   They also questioned the draft's portrayal of Jesus as having
divine ``infused knowledge,'' leaving little room for his
developing self-consciousness on earth.
   ``Any possibility of consequence for the humanity of Jesus is
thus excluded,'' the bishops say.
   They also say the document ``seems to establish a false
separation between science and faith,'' denigrating ``legitimate
claims of science.'' The bishops observe pointedly:
   ``The opposition between evolution and creation is obvious only
if one adopts a fundamentalist point of view toward the creation
accounts.''
   Concerning lay people, the draft seems to cast them ``in a
passive, receptive role'' rather than recognizing their active
initiatives, the bishops say.
   On this and other matters, the draft was seen as reflecting
attitudes pre-dating reforms of the Second Vatican Council.
Regarding the draft's treatment of ecumenical efforts for Christian
unity, the bishops say:
   ``As the text stands, it tends to emphasize disunity and appears
to suggest that the principal reason for dialogue is to overcome
heresy and schism.''
   The bishops point out another apparent retreat from Vatican II's
view that the Christian church ``subsists'' in Catholicism, but
isn't limited to it: The draft says the church ``has its
existence'' in Catholicism.
   That's close to the terminology the Vatican Council rejected as
limiting Christianity to Catholicism, the bishops note, implying
the draft hints a throwback to that insular view.

<HEAD>Debate Over Daimler Plan Illustrates Concern About Central Berlin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLARE NULLIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A neglected piece of land next to the
crumbling Berlin Wall has become the focus of controversy over how
to rebuild what once was the center of a vibrant capital.
   It is the spot on Potsdamer Platz, one of Europe's most elegant
squares before World War II, that the giant Daimler-Benz wants to
erect a new headquarters.
   Fears have grown in both West and East Berlin that the shopping
spree for land is about to start and that large, rich Western
companies will determine the city's future landscape.
   ``What Berlin does not need is quick projects thought up in an
illusory and short-lived reunification euphoria,'' East Berlin
architect Bruno Flierl said in an interview.
   One of East Berlin's chief planners has expressed concern about
possible economic ``colonialism'' by the West.
   After much internal bickering, the West Berlin city council has
agreed to take competitive bids in July for a contract to rebuild
the former central district.
   East Berlin will play a role in the decisions only after the
election May 6 of its first democratically chosen city council.
This has caused complaints that East Berliners will have little
time to study documents affecting their part of the city.
   Since the Berlin Wall was built in 1961, Potsdamer Platz on one
Western side of it and neighboring Leipziger Platz on the other
have been desolate symbols of a divided country.
   Together, they had been the hub of Berlin and one of Europe's
busiest districts. That ended with the destruction of World War II,
the city's division and the building of the wall.
   Since the wall began falling in November, Potsdamer Platz has
become a major pedestrian crossing point. Motor vehicles use a
newly completed section of four-lane highway linking East Berlin
with streets in the West that were dead ends for a generation.
   Makeshift souvenir stands in Potsdamer Platz sell chunks of the
wall and Soviet military uniforms to tourists. Circus tents and
vans have sprouted on nearby land that is empty most of the year.
   Construction of an apartment block on Leipziger Platz was halted
last fall, when demonstrations and protest ended 40 years of
Stalinist rule.
   An East German border guard said the work stopped when hopes
were aroused that the area might become the center of the city
again, not just another place to build housing complexes.
   He said the West German chain store Wertheim planned to put its
head office on the foundation of the unbuilt apartment house.
   Asked how he felt about Western companies taking choice sites,
he shrugged and said of the planners: ``I just hope they leave us
some green spaces.''
   Other East Germans feel more strongly.
   ``It would be unfair if all the high-tech went to West Berlin
while the East was used for cheap production and storage
facilities,'' said Guenther Stahn, East Berlin's ranking planners.
``That would be a colonialist concept.''
   West Berlin's Social Democratic Party wants to attract
investment to the city as quickly as possible and has welcomed the
Daimler-Benz plan to build a headquarters for 8,000 employees.
   ``We can't afford to keep such an investor waiting,'' Mayor
Walter Momper of West Berlin told his city council recently.
   The Alternative List, coalition partner of the Social Democrats
in the council, does not agree and said in a statement: ``Daimler
is not the star around which Potsdamer Platz plans revolve.''
   Representatives of the Alternative List, the equivalent in West
Berlin of the environmentalist Greens Party, say the Daimler
building would be too dominant in the square. They also argue
against a company that makes armaments occupying such a prime site.
   If construction of the headquarters goes forward as intended in
1992, the Alternative List demands it house a permanent exhibition
on ``the role of the concern during the Nazi years'' and on the
possibility of converting arms production to peaceful uses.
   West Berlin council members agreed in April on the basic outline
of future plans for the city, including priority treatment of
public transport and provision of open, green spaces.
   They did not give Daimler a firm commitment, but said they and
the new East Berlin council elected in May would consider it.

<HEAD>No Censorship, but Control Is Another Question</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE JAHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Censorship ended with the fall of
Nicolae Ceausescu in December, but the opposition says state
control of television and major newspapers, and of newspaper
distribution, is just as effective.
   Spokesmen for independent news outlets and parties say telling
the opposition story is extremely difficult as Romania approaches
its first free elections in 44 years, scheduled for May 20.
   The chief target of criticism is the National Salvation Front,
which dominates the interim government and is suspected by many of
seeking to bring back a milder form of communism.
   Many ranking members of the Front, including interim President
Ion Iliescu, are former Communists who had been critical of
Ceausescu. Front leaders profess democratic ideals, including a
commitment to freedom of the press.
   The Human Rights Law Group, based in Washington, D.C., said
after a fact-finding tour in late April that many Romanians
believed the Front controlled the government.
   It said the Front's advantages ``are amplified by the
government's control of television, printing presses and newsprint,
distribution of national and opposition print media, international
communications networks, and air and ground transport.''
   ``There are widespread complaints that the newspapers
distributed by the government, especially those of opposition
parties and certain independent papers, often fail to reach their
destination, are not delivered promptly or are returned when they
could have been sold,'' the monitoring group said.
   Several journalists working for independent dailies or
opposition party papers echoed those concerns in recent interviews.
   On television, ``representatives of opposing political parties .
.. have three minutes to tell their story from scripts held in
their hand,'' said Petre Mihai Bacanu, president of the
4,000-member Independent Journalists Union.
   ``Mr. Iliescu could grin on the screen all day and nobody at the
television would mind,'' he said.
   Supporters of the Front say Iliescu and other senior officials
get more coverage because national leaders make more news than
obscure candidates for Parliament.
   Several journalists said even coverage of news events was biased
in the Front's favor.
   One example cited was a demonstration organized by the Liberal
Party at which the camera dwelt at length on barefooted gypsies in
the crowd. Most Romanians think of gypsies as idlers and thieves.
   Images of roses, flattering graphics and stirring music were
added to taped coverage of a Front rally, the journalists said.
   Distribution of independent or opposition daily newspapers was
one of the problems mentioned most often.
   Bacanu is a member of the group that publishes Romania Libera,
which has a circulation of 850,000 and is the largest paper
regularly critical of the government.
   He snorted when asked whether copies were reaching readers in
the provinces. ``People on the train simply throw them off,''
Becanu said.
   Gelu Netea, manager of the Liberal Party paper Vitorul, said
state trucking companies were run run by ``neo-Communists,''
meaning supporters of the Front, who did not honor contracts to
deliver the newspaper nationwide.
   In Bucharest, ``the press distributor regularly either doesn't
take our copies or only a small amount,'' Netea said during an
interview in his office. He gestured at stacks of newspapers
several days old.
   Other government companies with agreements to distribute 80,000
copies nationally ``will take only 40,000 on a given day and then
will wait up to five days to take them to newsstands,'' he said.
   Officials and supporters of the government denied the charges.
   Both sides agree the state-run presses, which turned out only a
half-dozen dailies in Ceausescu's day, are woefully inadequate for
printing the more than 700 newspapers now being published.
   Some typesetting machines at the central printing plant date
from the 1940s and much of the lead is melted in an antiquated
gas-fired furnace.
   ``Welcome to Gutenberg's era,'' a foreman on the printing floor
told a Western reporter who was touring the plant.

<HEAD>Infiniti Q45 Blends Style, Power</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto, Graphic</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   No offense to Mother Nature and the folks who brought us those
Zenlike Infiniti ads, but the car can more than hold its own
against rocks and trees.
   The 1990 Infiniti Q45 is, in fact, a delightful car that
impresses as subtly as nature does.
   There's the understated, yet warm and inviting interior of the
Q45. No burl walnut here, but there is plenty of smooth leather,
soft roofing material and functional, well-arrayed gauges.
   There's the controlled but powerful 4.5-liter, 32-valve V-8
teamed with four-speed automatic overdrive transmission. Because of
advanced electronics this engine doesn't spin the wheels but
purposely propels the car with controlled ease. The powerplant
responds almost effortlessly and seems to never be taxed, even at
high speeds and in demanding manuevers.
   There's the car's moonmobile exterior, with door handles that
mirror the shape of the auto and front hood lines reflecting the
rounded profile of the vehicle. It's sleek.
   Nissan is justly proud of its flagship. For while the car's
early advertising _ showing rocks and trees but no vehicle _ may
have missed its mark, the Q45 definitely has not.
   Positioned against the high-priced European sedans such as the
$39,700 Jaguar XJ6 and Toyota's $35,000 new Lexus LS400, the Q45 _
with a base price of $38,000 _ is a solid competitor.
   The money buys plenty of performance in every area, including
standard antilock four-wheel disc brakes that produce stable, sure
stopping. It's impressive to stomp on the brakes and find hardly
any diving movement at the front end. In the test car there was
just a gradual dip in the front even when I stopped suddenly from
high speed.
   Because the test car had the optional High Capacity Actively
Controlled Steering, the Q45 also barely showed any body roll, or
yaw in sudden lane changes and side moves. This option provides
four-wheel steering that briefly turns the rear wheels in the
opposite direction of the front wheels when needed and then
switches them to the same direction at high speeds.
   Infiniti engineers worked wonders with the Q45 suspension. It
seemed a bit more taut and less cushiony than that of the Lexus,
yet I barely noticed bumps. The Infiniti's 4.5-liter,
278-horsepower engine will push the car from 0-60 mph in 7.5
seconds, says Nissan, which limited top speed to 150 mph via
electronic controls to ensure drivers don't vault into the next
galaxie.
   The 4-liter Lexus produces 250 horsepower and reaches 60 in 7.9
seconds.
   The downside is that the Q45's fuel economy is lower than that
of the Lexus LS400: 16 mpg in the city versus 18 mpg for the LS400,
making the Infiniti subject to a $500 gas guzzler tax at purchase.
   The Q45 exterior is nearly as aerodynamic as the Lexus: .30 drag
coefficient versus .29 for the Lexus, though the front end of the
Lexus seems a bit more square. All metal seams on the Infiniti test
car were lined up with impeccable precision.
   Inside, the Q45 has wide, soft front seats that are adjusted
electronically and have two memory settings. Stitching in the
leather seats lines up with back and leg muscles for maximum
comfort. The thick, leather-wrapped steering wheel (with air bag)
telescopes upward and tilts to the desired position electronically.
   The standard Bose sound system was terrific, with big buttons
for easy adjustment. A sunroof, cruise control, heated outside
mirrors and sun visors that had to be released from the ceiling by
pressing a button were other features.
   Sitting in the back seat, I tucked my toes under the front seats
when they were all the way back on their tracks. But my knees still
didn't touch the seat backs, and legroom was decent if the front
seats were moved up a bit.
   The middle passenger in back would have to contend with the
large hump in the floor that accommodates the Infiniti's rear drive
mechanisms.
   The trunk was flat and deeply spacious.
   BMW and Mercedes-Benz owners make up the largest group of early
Infiniti buyers. Infiniti reports that 50 percent of the trade-ins
have come from owners of those German makes. Another 25 percent of
the trade-ins are domestic models such as Cadillac and Lincoln, and
the rest are Japanese cars, such as Maximas, Accords and Cressidas.
   More than 3,350 Q45s were sold in the first five months after
the car was introduced in November. Infiniti says it does not have
projections for expected sales.
   The typical buyer is male, median age 42, the company says. A
majority are married, and most have household incomes approaching
$100,000 a year. At least 90 percent have college educations.
   Because the Q45 is a new model, Consumer Reports magazine does
not list owner reports of trouble.

<HEAD>HAPPY BIRTHDAY BUGS: Wascally Wabbit Marks 50th, Doc</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhotos</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY McSHANE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   He may be 50, but that doesn't make Bugs Bunny
an old gray hare.
   The wascally wabbit and long-time torturer of Elmer J. Fudd hits
the half-century mark this year, and the carrot-chomping star with
the Brooklynese tongue is aging as gracefully as ever.
   ``Everybody knows who I am, Doc. I don't cayuh where dey are or
who dey are. Even in Mars dey know about me. Heh heh heh,'' Bugs
once said in an interview with The Associated Press.
   Success didn't come easily for Bugs; he had to change his name
and work underground before making it big. But he's enjoyed a
career many Hollywood stars _ living or sketched _ would envy.
   He surfaced this year as a presenter on the Academy Awards; in
1958, he won his own Oscar for best animated short feature,
``Knighty Knight, Bugs.'' The rabbit since has become a Saturday
morning cartoon fixture, and makes more prime time appearances each
year than Bob Hope.
   On Dec. 21, 1985, Bugs received a star on Hollywood's Walk of
Fame _ admittedly, not in the best spot. He sits between cowboy
actor Rory Calhoun and actress Lurene Tuttle, who made such
memorable movies as ``The Clonus Horror,'' ``White Mama'' and
``Final Chapter _ Walking Tall.''
   The brash bunny was the consumate of cool. Always undersized,
he's outwitted grouchy gremlins, Daffy Duck and gun-toting galoots.
In ``Haredevil Hare'' he defends the honor of Earth against a
Martian with high-top sneakers named Commander X-2.
   He's sung opera and tweaked the nose of pompous tenors. He
outraced tortoises and hounded hunting dogs.
   And his rabbit hole was his castle, to be defended to the death
against developers and intruders. ``Of course, you realize, this
means war,'' Bugs would say to those who provoked him.
   You'd never see Bugs with a girlfriend, and like Milton Berle,
he'd flirt in drag to confuse a foe. But Bugs was his own rabbit _
fiercely independent and fresh.
   Bugs' encounters with frequent foil Fudd are regarded as
classics. The easily-frustrated Fudd was battered by Bugs from
infancy to old age in a series of shorts.
   After tormenting Fudd in one episode, Bugs turned to the
audience and clucked: ``I do dis kind of stuff to him all through
the picture.''
   Rarely did Fudd ever turn the tables on his animated adversary.
Once is a story in which Elmer portrays a millionaire who's gone
off the deep end. He and his shrink keep repeating the same tagline
throughout the cartoon: ``My name is Elmer J. Fudd, millionaire. I
own a mansion and a yacht.'' The oft-repeated line finally gets to
Bugs who checks into a mental hospital.
   In another cartoon, a Wagner send-up, Fudd, clad in Viking
horns, sings to the strains of ``Ride of the Walkueres'': ``Kill
the wabbit, kill the wabbit ...''
   The Bugs-Fudd battles _ most featuring Elmer as a befuddled
hunter _ have recently been honored in a Museum of Modern Art
exhibit and preserved at the Museum of Cartoon Art. The latter is
planning an anniversary retrospective for Bugs. The 50th birthday
will also be marked with widespread release of Bugs video
collections, a prime-time special and a special Bugs magazine
produced by LIFE magazine.
   It's been more than his lucky rabbit feet that have kept Bugs on
top through the decades. He's outlived the Flintstones, seen a
future without the Jetsons and continues to ride high in the age of
the Simpsons.
   So what is it about Bugs that makes him timeless?
   ``Bugs is a natural person leading a normal life until someone
aggravates him. Then he fights back,'' explains Chuck Jones, now
77, who directed more than 50 Bugs shorts. ``In other words, he's a
sort of counter-revolutionary.''
   Bugs is hero to many of us. He does the things we'd like to do
but don't have the ``noive'' to carry through.
   His vintage cartoons are currently seen all over television by a
third generation of kids. In addition to Saturdays, he appears
daily on national cable stations Nickelodeon and TNT and is the
top-rated show on both.
   Jones admits Bugs can be a bully or a nuisance, so he took great
care in setting the rabbit in situations in which he would remain a
sympathetic figure.
   Mel Blanc, the man of 1,000 voices who gave life to Bugs, would
defend the rabbit's honor if he didn't like a script, telling the
writer, ``Bugs wouldn't do that,'' or ``Bugs would never say that.''
   It was Blanc who changed ``Happy Rabbit,'' a nice-guy bunny of
the late 1930s, into the rough and tumble rabbit we've come to know
and love. Blanc ditched the wimpy name, added the ``dese'' and
``dose'' of streetwise Brooklyn and rechristened the character Bugs.
   The west, as they say, is histowy.
   Bugs debuted on July 27, 1940, in the short ``A Wild Hare,'' and
he was off and running.
   Early on, he became part of the World War II propaganda pitch,
turning up a a draftee, a superpatriot Marine _ ``a real Superman''
_ a ``Rabbit the Riveter'' assembly line worker. Today, he's joined
the ``Just Say No'' war on drugs, appearing in an anti-drug cartoon
that aired last month.
   Through the years he's become even more underdog than he was in
the beginning, increasingly opting for brains over brawn. Such
adaptability has served him well. In dozens of shorts, Bugs has
remained a Hollywood trendsetter:
   _ Long before Sigourney Weaver battled ``Aliens,'' Bugs went
mano-a-mano with Commander X-2.
   _ Forget ``Field of Dreams'' and other baseball flicks.
``Baseball Bugs'' featured a slow-balling Bugs playing all nine
positions and defeating the Gas House Gorillas. Bugs scales the
Empire State Building for the game-saving catch.
   _ Robert De Niro as untouchable Al Capone? The rabbit took on
legendary tough guys Edward G. Robinson and Peter Lorre in
``Racketeer Rabbit.'' And Bobby D.'s turn as Jake LaMotta in
``Raging Bull'' had little on Bugs' showdown with boxing brute The
Crusher.
   There's much, much more: Bugs as the straight hare in a Jekyll
and Hyde send-up, Bugs evading two Robinson Crusoe types bent on
turning him into roast rabbit, torturing two French chefs with
similar intent, outwitting a rabbit-bashing witch on Halloween.
   And there's more than a touch of bad boy in Bugs; in addition to
his Fudd abuse, he frustrated Yosemite Sam to the point where
Yosemite screams ``great horney toads,'' driven Daffy Duck near
daft and dispatched dozens of animated assailants.
   ``Ain't I a stinker?'' he says in one cartoon.
   But it hasn't been all good news for the rabbit over the last 50
years. The death last year at age 81 of Blanc, who had been the
voice of practically all the Warner Bros. Looney Tunes-Merrie
Melodies characters, was a blow to fans around the world.
   But Blanc didn't take the rabbit's ``What's up, Doc?'' with him.
His son, Noel, and actor Jeff Bergman have taken over as the
bunny's voicebox, and Bugs is still going strong.
   To anyone who might think an aging Bugs has seen his best days,
well, as Bugs might say: ``He don't know me vewy well, do he?''

   The National Association of Purchasing Management said Tuesday
its economic index rose to 50.2 percent in April from 48.8 percent
the previous month. A reading above 50 indicates the manufacturing
economy generally is expanding; below 50, that it is generally

that without a company cost-cutting program the slide would have

   A slumping auto market and the soaring costs of incentives

   The White House said it would not resist the
resignation of savings and loan bailout boss L. William Seidman.
   Seidman, 69, is chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,
which guarantees bank and S&amp;L deposits, and of the Resolution Trust
Corp., the agency charged with disposing of failed thrifts. His
term expires in October 1991.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday, ``Bill has
indicated he's not going to stay the whole term, and we are
interested in getting new leadership there that would carry on an
aggressive program when the time comes.''

   The costs of caring for the elderly will soar
in the coming decades without advances in the prevention and
treatment of illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease, researchers
reported.
   As baby boomers age and medical advances increase their life
span, a larger group of Americans will be at risk of developing the
debilitating diseases that rob the elderly of their independence,
the researchers said Tuesday.
   ``This is where the challenge of aging (research) lies,'' said
Dr. Jack M. Guralnik, an epidemiologist at the National Institute
on Aging and co-author of a report in this week's Journal of the
American Medical Association.

   Burger King Corp., the nation's second-largest
hamburger chain, is switching to Coca-Cola Co. as the official soft
drink supplier for its U.S. stores, ending a six-year association
with Pepsi-Cola Co.
   ``We selected Coca-Cola because of its ability to provide a
powerful mix of global brand strength, state-of-the-art
technological capabilities and distinctive service,'' Chief
Executive Barry J. Gibbons said Tuesday.
   Burger King said Coca-Cola products such as Coca-Cola Classic,
Diet Coke, Sprite and Minute Maid orange soda will replace
Pepsi-Cola's soft drink lineup in its restaurants over the next
several months.

   Sometime this summer, a Burger King customer may
leave an opening for a quick-witted clerk by simply ordering
``Cheeseburger, Pepsi.''
   ``No Pepsi, Coke,'' the order-taker will be able to say, in a
variation on the line that the late comedian John Belushi made
famous years ago.
   Burger King Corp., the nation's second-largest hamburger chain,
said Tuesday it is switching to Coca-Cola Co. as its official
domestic soft drink supplier, ending an association that started in
1983 with Pepsi-Cola Co.
   Miami-based Burger King said Coca-Cola products such as
Coca-Cola Classic, Diet Coke, Sprite and Minute Maid orange soda
will replace Pepsi-Cola's soft drink lineup in its restaurants over
the next three months.
   Analysts said the loss of the high-profile account is a blow to
Pepsi-Cola's prestige, but it would have minimal impact on earnings
for either soft-drink company.
   Pepsi-Cola, based in Somers, N.Y., said the loss of the Burger
King account ``was not entirely unexpected'' in view of recent
management changes at Burger King. It was acquired by the British
conglomerate Grand Metropolitan PLC in January 1989 and switched
advertising agencies last year.
   ``We selected Coca-Cola because of its ability to provide a
powerful mix of global brand strength, state-of-the-art
technological capabilities and distinctive service,'' Burger King
Chief Executive Barry J. Gibbons said.
   Atlanta-based Coca-Cola controls an estimated 65 percent of the
fountain portion of the U.S. soft drink business and is the primary
supplier for most of the major fast-food chains, including leader
McDonald's Corp.
   Recently, Wendy's International Inc. said it was planning to
switch to Coca-Cola at its 1,100 company-owned restaurants when its
agreement with Pepsi-Cola expires at the end of the year.
   Pepsi-Cola still has some major restaurant accounts, including
Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and Kentucky Fried Chicken, all owned by its
parent, PepsiCo Inc. It also serves the Dunkin' Donuts, Subway,
Shakey's and Ground Round chains, according to spokesman Tod
MacKenzie.
   MacKenzie said Pepsi hopes to continue serving franchisee-owned
Burger King restaurants. But Burger King spokeswoman Cori Zywotow
said her company's franchise agreements require licensees to go
along with its choice of a soft drink supplier.
   There are about 5,400 Burger King restaurants in the United
States, including 800 owned by Burger King and 4,600 owned by
franchisees.
   Neither Burger King nor Coca-Cola would estimate the value of
the soft-drink account.
   Burger King awarded its soft drink account to Pepsi-Cola in 1983
after years with Coca-Cola, and reaffirmed its intention to stay
with Pepsi only last June.
   But Ms. Zywotow said both soft drink companies were asked for
new proposals recently and the company decided to switch. She said
Coca-Cola will work with Burger King on new drink dispensing
technology and marketing programs.
   Emanuel Goldman, who follows the soft drink business for
PaineWebber in San Francisco, estimated Pepsi-Cola sales at Burger
King amounted to about 65 million cases, or about 13.5 percent of
Pepsi's annual fountain volume. The switch would boost Coca-Cola's
fountain volume by 6.5 percent, he said.
   Goldman said the switch should cut annual earnings of PepsiCo by
no more than a penny a share, while adding 1.5 cents a share at
most for Coca-Cola.
   But in addition to lost sales volume, the switch costs Pepsi a
valuable opportunity to have people to sample its products.
   ``A lot of people go into Burger King and see the name Coke or
Pepsi. How does that spill over into supermarket sales? That is the
part of it that isn't known,'' Goldman said.
   Jesse Meyers, editor of the trade publication Beverage Digest,
estimates the switch could add a percentage point to Coca-Cola's
40.5 percent share of the overall U.S. soft drink market while
cutting Pepsi-Cola's 30.7 percent share by the same amount. The
market is valued at $27.4 billion wholesale.
   Meyers said Burger King's decision to switch may be a response
to the recent rapid growth of PepsiCo's restaurant operations.
   ``While PepsiCo is selling chicken, tacos and pizza, Burger King
is saying `That competes with the share of stomach we are trying to
fill,''' he said.
   Pepsi's MacKenzie said there is ``more myth than reality'' to
that line of reasoning.

<HEAD>Analysts: Chrysler Cost-Cutting Working Despite 80-Percent
Earnings Drop</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 80 percent drop in Chrysler Corp.'s
first-quarter earnings wasn't nearly as bad as expected and shows
the company's cost-cutting program may be taking hold, analysts say.
   The nation's No. 3 automaker reported Tuesday it earned $71
million, or 32 cents a share, on revenues of $7.56 billion during
the first three months of this year. It earned $351 million, or
$1.50 a share, on revenues of $9.66 billion in the same period last
year.
   That's good news, Chairman Lee Iacocca said. Wall Street
appeared to agree.
   Chrysler stock closed up 75 cents Tuesday at $15.75 on the New
York Stock Exchange. Monday's closing price was a 52-week low.
   As recently as late last week, analysts were speculating that
Chrysler's results would flirt with the break-even point.
   ``Our surprise is that we got as much cost-savings benefit as
quickly as we did,'' said analyst Charles Brady of Oppenheimer &amp;
Co. of New York.
   Last October, Chrysler began a program aimed at slicing $1.5
billion from its annual costs by the end of 1990. Analysts said
Tuesday it appears the company is on track to reach that target.
   ``They are well on their way to accomplishing their $1.5 billion
cost-reduction goal,'' said analyst Scott Merlis of Morgan, Stanley
&amp; Co. of New York. ``It seems like Chrysler's management is
delivering.
   ``They already have put their money where their mouths were.''
   Analysts have forecast earnings declines of more than 75 percent
for General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. when the nation's two
largest automakers report their first-quarter results later this
week.
   ``I think the street is beginning to think that Ford and GM may
have some cost-cutting surprises for this quarter or the next
one,'' Merlis said.
   Analysts estimated that Chrysler cut $200 million out of its
standing costs during the first quarter.
   ``It shows the leanness and the meanness of management hammering
home on the cost-cutting front,'' said analyst John Kirnan of
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. of New York.
   Not everything was rosy with Chrysler's financial picture. The
company spent about twice as much on incentives during the first
quarter and the automaker continues to fight a tough battle to hold
on to its share of the U.S. market. Chrysler eked out a slim $8
million profit on its car operations in the quarter.
   ``People still want to see the product side improve,'' Kirnan
said.
   The next major product change Chrysler has on tap is its new
minivan, which hits dealerships this fall. Chrysler, which derives
much of its profit from minivan sales, sells more of the popular
vehicles than all other minivan makers combined but competitors
have begun to nibble away at its market share.
   This summer, the company will be shutting down both of its
minivan assembly plants for four weeks for retooling. That could
spell trouble for the company's second and third quarters.
   ``I would not be surprised to see a red number for the third
quarter,'' said analyst David Healy of Barclays-BZW of New York,
``but the second quarter should be profitable, probably a good bit
better than the first quarter.''
   The company also said its Chrysler Financial Corp. subsidiary
posted an $89 million profit for the first quarter, up from $86
million in the fourth quarter of last year.

   New England's slumping economy and real estate
market have pushed many banks to the brink of failure and
eventually could force them into government hands, analysts say.
   Last week, regulators seized control of Home Owners Federal
Savings Bank _ the largest savings and loan in Massachusetts.
Analysts said Tuesday this action was a signal of things to come.
   ``Are we going to see a rash of closures in the next few months
_ probably not,'' said Gerard Cassidy, a banking analyst at Tucker
Anthony Inc. ``But when this thing finally washes out, three, four,
five years from now, we're going to look back, and there probably
is going to be at least two dozen.''
   The sinking economy, combined with a declining real estate
market, has given many banks a staggering amount of troubled loans.
Banks have had to divert money into reserves while watching their
capital shrink to precarious levels.
   James McFarland, deputy regional director of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., said there would probably be a ``handful'' of
failures this year.
   But he stressed that well below 10 percent of the banks in New
England have poor ratings from the government.
   In Massachusetts and Connecticut, 32 banks at the end of 1989
were losing money so fast it would deplete their equity within one
year, according to Veribanc Inc., a Wakefield, Mass., firm that
monitors the industry.
   ``It's a good bet there will some seizures among them,
especially with the economy going the way it is,'' said Warren
Heller, research director for Veribanc.
   Analysts say the direction of the economy will be the most
important factor in determining whether weak banks survive.
   Bank of New England Corp., for example, lost more than $1
billion last year, due largely to its real estate portfolio. The
bank now is operating under government orders and has instituted a
plan to improve its financial health, but executives have
acknowledged the recovery hinges on the New England economy.
   Other banks have admitted they are in peril. Home National Corp.
of Milford, Mass., has disclosed its subsidiary Home National Bank
is seeking financial assistance from the federal government to
continue operating.
   Eliot Bank in Boston reported a $30 million loss for the fourth
quarter of 1989 and said it expected regulators to ``take such
actions as they consider appropriate'' if the bank could not raise
capital.
   Another teetering company is One Bancorp of Portland, Maine,
which has $26 million in capital but $290 million in troubled loans.
   One Bancorp, like many savings banks in New England, converted
to stock ownership in the 1980s amid the boom on Wall Street. That
provided them with billions of dollars in new capital, which many
used to move into the then-booming construction market.
   ``The only thing they knew how to do was lend money in real
estate,'' said James Moynihan, senior vice president of Advest Inc.
in Boston. ``They were all tripping over each other to find
projects.''
   This created several problems for savings banks. Many had been
accustomed to home construction lending but felt pressure to move
into other commercial loans to get better returns and improve their
shareholder earnings, McFarland said.
   But when the real estate market declined, poor loans were
exposed and the losses mounted.
   Heller, at Veribanc, said some savings institutions were already
in weak condition before they raised money by converting to stock
ownership.
   ``This was a one-time capital infusion,'' Heller said. ``They
had their one chance and they blew it.''

<HEAD>Campbell Soup Co. Eliminates 364 Jobs At Headquarters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MELANIE BURNEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Campbell Soup Co.'s chief said the company's
sluggish performance has forced it to slash its headquarters staff
and turn aggressive to stave off a possible sale or merger.
   ``We want to have winning results which is in terms of earnings,
returns and cash that would make any raider look at us and gasp,''
said David W. Johnson, president and chief executive officer.
   Campbell's announced Tuesday it would eliminate 364 positions
from its headquarters staff, a cut of 19 percent, in a bid to
strengthen its bottom line and pacify disgruntled shareholders.
   ``Fundamentally the company has not been delivering the kind of
financial performance investors, shareholders and Wall Street would
like it to have. Our record is very poor,'' Johnson said.
   The company also decided to halt plans for a new $35 million
headquarters proposed for the city's waterfront, said Johnson, the
first outsider to head Campbell in its 121-year history.
   The financially strapped city has been counting heavily on the
plan as the lynchpin of its economic revival.
   ``A $35 million high-prestige world-class headquarters at a time
when we are financially embattled would have been irresponsible,''
said Johnson. ``I think it is not understood how embattled we are.''
   Johnson, chosen in January to take over Campbell because of his
experience at beleaguered companies, said 267 employees received
``pink slips'' Tuesday morning.
   He said 97 positions at the headquarters had been eliminated
through attrition since Jan. 1.
   ``We cut out those jobs to become leaner and more productive and
more effective,'' Johnson told reporters at a news conference
outside company headquarters in Camden.
   The cutbacks, effective immediately, will save about $17 million
over the first full fiscal year and reduce Campbell's headquarter's
staff to 1,588 employees.
   Johnson, who was chosen to head Campbell because of the changes
he spearheaded at Gerber Products Co., did not rule out additional
layoffs in Camden and elsewhere if the performance does not improve.
   The announcement came nearly two months after Campbell's closed
its historic 121-year-old manufacturing plant in Camden,
eliminating 940 blue-collar jobs.
   Johnson said Campbell's plans to maintain a presence in Camden.
He says the company is considering seeking an outside builder for
the waterfront project and leasing office space to other businesses.
   Camden Mayor Aaron A. Thompson, who met with Johnson several
months ago, remained optimistic Campebell's will play a role in the
city's $500 million waterfront revitalization project.
   ``Their commitment to the waterfront is an unaltered
commitment,'' Thompson said Tuesday.
   But not everyone shared Thompson's confidence that the company
will reamin in the economically depressed city of about 85,000
residents.
   ``That is an enormous impact on this economy,'' said Camden
County Freeholder Director Robert Andrews.
   ``We know they're going to be leaner because they're laying our
people off,'' said Andrews. ``But how do we know they're going to
stay here?''
   Johnson said Campbell's is facing some tough times of its own
with earnings lagging at nearly half the rate of other food
competitors.
   In December, some members of Campbell's founding family put
their stake in the company up for sale and said they would push for
a sale of the entire company. But three children of longtime
Chairman John Dorrance Jr., who received control of their father's
31.3 percent share of the company, have vowed to maintain their
ownership and keep Campbell independent.
   Under Johnson, Campbell has closed three domestic plants and two
overseas plants, a distribution facility in Chicago and integrated
Canadian and American operations since January. Campbell also has
put its Juice Bowl business up for sale.
   ``We are really in the middle of a fight back to remain strong
and independent and headquartered in Camden,'' said Johnson.

<HEAD>Baxter Says It Cleared Israel Plant Sale With Commerce Department</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Baxter International Inc. said it cleared the
sale of a manufacturing plant in Israel with the Department of
Commerce to avoid the appearance of a conflict with U.S. law.
   Nevertheless, the world's largest hospital supply company now
finds itself the target of allegations by a former employee that it
sold the plant to get off the Arab League's blacklist of companies
doing business with the Jewish state. That would violate a U.S. law
forbidding American companies from participating in foreign
boycotts.
   Baxter has agreed to build a similar plant in Syria to
synthesize intravenous body fluids.
   Baxter spokesman Les Jacobson said Tuesday the company has
higher hopes for a profitable operation in Syria than in Israel,
where he said skyrocketing inflation helped make the plant a
money-loser.
   Company officials didn't seek to curry favor with the Arabs by
selling the plant in Israel, he said.
   Jewish leaders are demanding an explanation from Baxter,
headquartered in Deerfield, north of Chicago.
   The issue arose from a memorandum about Baxter's Middle East
operations that is purportedly on file in the Arab League's boycott
office in the Syrian capitol of Damascus. The memo suggests the
1988 sale of the Israeli plant and the removal of Baxter from the
Arab boycott list were linked.
   Jacobson said Baxter officials repeatedly sought opinions from
former Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and from the Commerce
Department on its Middle Eastern operations beginning in 1982.
   He said Baxter had received assurances it was doing nothing
improper in selling the Israeli plant, which was built in 1971 and
employed about 200 people.
   ``Because the law is unclear in many respects, we felt we needed
some clearance and guidance,'' Jacobson said.
   ``We went to them and said `Here's what we're doing in the
Middle East, is this OK? They said they'd see no problems with
that.''
   The anti-boycott law was enacted in 1977, when Vance was in
office, to discourage corporations from seeking Arab business by
promising to avoid commerce with Israel.
   Jacobson said the law is ``murky'' in defining the conditions
under which it would be proper for a U.S. company to provide to an
Arab country information about its dealings in Israel.
   He said Baxter probably discussed with Syrian government
officials its plans to sell the Israel plant, not as a condition of
being dropped from the Arab League blacklist but rather in the
context of negotiations that resulted in their April 13 agreement
to jointly build a plant in Syria. The plant is scheduled to open
late next year.
   Jacobson questioned the authenticity of the Arab League memo,
copies of which were sent to Baxter directors and to The Wall
Street Journal by Dr. Richard Fuisz, is a Washington-area
businessman and former chief executive officer of Baxter's Middle
Eastern Medcom subsidiary.
   Fuisz sued Baxter in 1985 for wrongful termination and
defamation after he was ousted from his job and demoted, Jacobson
said. The lawsuit was settled, but Fuisz reportedly remains bitter
toward his former employer.
   Fuisz could not be reached for comment. Telephone calls to his
home in Great Falls, Va., went unanswered.
   Neither the Commerce Department nor the Securities and Exchange
Commission, which are reviewing the company's Middle East
activities, would comment.
   The memo says Baxter promised not to do any more business with
Israel.
   Jacobson said Baxter continues to distribute a variety of
products in Israel and has no plans to stop doing so.
   ``The memo implies that we agreed to halt any further commercial
activity in Israel, which is flatly untrue,'' Jacobson said. ``We
know very well that would be illegal.''

<HEAD>Information Technology Touted As Way To Cut Healthcare Costs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hospitals must rely on greater technology to
combat rising health-care costs, but the gadgets will take their
cue from the supermarket and banking industries, experts say.
   A consulting firm on Tuesday unveiled a prototype of its
``Hospital of the Future'' crammed with information, not medical,
technology to help keep track of and treat patients.
   Designed by Andersen Consulting with the help of the American
College of Healthcare Executives, the prototype uses everything
from bar codes to handheld computers, from ``smartcards'' to
pneumatic tubes, from voice recognition to fiber optics to cut time
and money spent shuffling around information.
   ``Forty percent of a nurse's time is spend doing administrative
and clerical chores,'' said Jay Toole, Andersen's partner in charge
of healthcare.
   Hospitals have lagged behind industry in taking advantage of
technology, Toole said. They spend only 3 percent of their budgets
on information handling compared to 8 percent to 10 percent for the
banking and insurance industries.
   The technology may be directed more towards saving money than
saving lives, Toole said, but it nevertheless would give healthcare
workers time to practice their craft and improve the quality of
care.
   While most hospitals already have their financial operations
computerized and may use computers in clinical or patient care,
there has been little communication among the areas, said Gene
Handley, education director of the American College of Healthcare
Executives.
   ``We have to achieve greater economies in the area of
information technology,'' he said. ``We're looking for economies
that allow one system to communicate with another system.''
   Andersen Consulting, a subsidiary of the accounting firm Arthur
Anderson &amp; Co., invested $7 million in its ``Hospital of the
Future'' display, which opened Tuesday at Dallas's Infomart
technology market.
   More than 40 different vendors, including Digital Equipment
Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co. and NCR Corp., have been linked with
programming that allows the normally incompatible systems to
``talk'' to each other.
   A patient's introduction to the system begins in admitting,
where financial information is taken and rooms assigned. That
information is transmitted immediately to the floor where the
patient will be taken and to the business office.
   At the same time, the patient's medical and financial
information is put on a ``smartcard,'' a credit-card-sized piece of
plastic that can hold up to 1,000 pages of text.
   Later, when tests or medication are ordered, the laboratory and
pharmacy systems ship results or records back and forth. The system
also keeps better tabs on billing, designers said, so that fewer
charges are lost.
   Information can be entered through bedside or handheld computer
terminals, or at a nurse's station.
   There's even a system that converts X-rays into computer
language, allowing the images to be transmitted not only around the
hospital but to a doctor's office, for example, for outside
consultations.
   Other systems help keep track of operating room schedules and
supplies. Physicians also can tie in to computer databases, which
contain the latest medical information.
   The technology also reaches into homes through a portable
computer than can remind patients when and what medicine to take,
and can transmit that information back to a physician or home
healthcare agency.

<HEAD>Bankruptcy Hearings Begin in Ames Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal bankruptcy judge has approved an
interim plan giving Ames Department Stores Inc. a new leader and
allowing the discount retailer to borrow $40 million to keep
operating.
   The new chief executive officer, Stephen L. Pistner, would be
paid $1.5 million a year, plus a bonus of $500,000, to take on the
job of trying to bring the company out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection.
   The $2 million in total compensation is more than twice what the
chief executive at K mart, the nation's largest discount chain,
received in 1989 and more than $400,000 above what the top
executive received last year at Sears, the nation's largest
retailer.
   But U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Howard C. Buschman III on
Tuesday gave the company's plan interim approval, saying he was
comfortable that the salary is within the range that any executive
would demand to take on the Ames job.
   The Rocky Hill retail chain also got the court's approval to
borrow up to $40 million from Chemical Bank during the next week to
begin paying its bills and start restocking its 680 stores.
   During nearly a nearly five-hour hearing, Buschman heard
testimony about Ames's need for a new leader and money to keep the
company operating.
   ``The board members of this company have determined that the
company is a ship without a rudder,'' Buschman said. ``They have
determined that there is low morale within the company and with
creditors of the company, and that the appointment is needed to
begin to address the problems faced by the company.''
   Ames filed for bankruptcy court protection here last week,
listing assets of $1.67 billion and liabilities of $1.44 billion.
The company said it had to file because it could not get new
financing from its bankers and because suppliers had stopped
shipping merchandise to its stores.
   Ames Chairman James A. Harmon testified that the company began
searching for a new chief executive officer in early March.
   He said Ames also hired a consultant specializing in executive
compensation, and was told that the company would have to pay a
substantial salary to attract an executive willing to take on the
challenge of returning Ames to profitability.
   Harmon did not mention Ames' former chief executive officer,
Peter B. Hollis, who resigned Monday after more than three years at
the helm. Hollis engineered the 1988 acquisition of the Zayre
stores, which ultimately forced Ames into Chapter 11.
   Hollis received $889,053 in total compensation in 1988, the most
recent figure made public.
   But Harmon did say that Ames's board of directors was convinced
that the company needed a new chief executive officer quickly.
   ``There was general concern about the morale at the company,''
he said. ``With suppliers upset, shareholders distressed, creditors
concerned, there was a great deal of pressure on the executives and
the company was deteriorating quite rapidly. It was important that
we move to bring in a new CEO.''
   Harmon said Ames decided to hire Pistner, 58, because of his
experience in turning around troubled retailers. Pistner has headed
the Target, Dayton Hudson, Montgomery Ward and McCrory chains
during more than 20 years in the retail industry.
   Buschman signed an interim order Tuesday authorizing Pistner's
appointment. In order to give Ames's creditors more time to study
Pistner's background and comment on his hiring, Buschman said a
final hearing on the matter will be held May 15.
   Buschman also signed an order Tuesday allowing Ames to borrow
nearly $40 million from Chemical Bank during the next week. Ames
officials testified that the money was needed to begin ordering new
merchandise for the company's stores in time for the important
back-to-school and Christmas seasons.
   Buschman scheduled another hearing May 8 to rule on whether Ames
can borrow up to $250 million from Chemical Bank while it works to
reorganize its business.

   Stock prices rose sharply today on expectations
that the market would strengthen after the current holiday week,
while the dollar edged down against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Index gained 483.81 points, or 1.63
percent, closing at 30,173.64. It was the first time since April 9
that the index, which rose 105.03 points on Tuesday, closed above
30,000.
   Traders said the yen's strength against the dollar boosted
investors' optimism.
   ``Investors had been reassured by the market's recent stability
despite uptrends in overseas interest rates, and now they believe
the market will be even stronger after the holidays,'' said a
trader with Nomura Securities Co.
   Japan's financial markets were open only today and Tuesday this
week because of the ``Golden Week'' series of national holidays.
They will reopen Monday.
   An estimated 480 million shares changed hands on the exchange's
first section today, up from 245 million Tuesday.
   In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 158.55 yen, down 0.35
yen from Tuesday.

   The government and the airline industry are
offering $3 million for information leading to the arrest,
conviction or thwarting of air terrorists.
   In a move praised by relatives of terrorism victims and endorsed
by three government agencies, the Air Transport Association on
Tuesday added $1 million to a government reward program that
already totaled $2 million.
   And in another joint step Tuesday, airline officials and the
Federal Aviation Administration opposed proposed legislation that
would increase the government's role in inspecting aging airliners.
   Of the anti-terrorism reward, ATA President Robert J. Aaronson
said: ``This should be a powerful incentive for people within, or
close to, terrorist organizations to reveal plots before they are
hatched.''
   Aaronson said the airline trade group would match any government
reward up to $1 million if it involves a threat or attack against a
U.S. airline, and the money also would be available through the FBI
to match rewards designed to combat domestic air terrorism.
   Morris D. Busby, State Department ambassador for
counter-terrorism, said at an ATA news conference that rewards
already have been paid in the government's program, but details
would not be disclosed.
   FAA Administrator James B. Busey said the increased rewards send
a strong message to terrorists that ``the United States and the
aviation community are fully committed to this battle against
terrorism.''
   William Baker, FBI assistant director, said investigators are
meeting every day with foreign authorities in an effort to ``keep
the pressure on'' to solve the December 1988 bombing of Pan
American Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, that took 270 lives.
   No one has been charged or arrested, but authorities have said
they believe Middle East terrorists planted plastic explosives
inside a radio cassette player that became part of checked-in
luggage.
   Meanwhile, FAA Associate Administrator Anthony Broderick told a
House hearing that the proposed aging-airliner bill would increase
government liability and could cost between $1 million and $2
million per plane.
   Robert E. Doll, a United Airlines vice president who heads an
ATA-sponsored industry and government task force on aging
airliners, said adding inspection duties for the FAA could impair
other safety efforts.
   The bill, sponsored by Democratic and Republican leaders of the
House Public Works aviation subcommittee, would require the FAA to
thoroughly inspect each airliner during the last year of its
economic design life. Unless they pass an FAA inspection, planes
would be grounded after they reach a pre-determined life span.

   A year ago, the average price of a 20-inch
chain saw of the type used by many farmers was about $365, says the
Agriculture Department. Today, the same saw is around $375.
   That's an increase of less than 3 percent, but it illustrates
that the creep of inflation is still gnawing at consumers,
including the nation's farmers.
   Overall, the department's National Agricultural Statistics
Service reported this week, the April index of prices paid by
farmers for commodities, services, interest, taxes and hired labor
was up 3.4 percent from April 1989.
   The agency reports prices for a list of items periodically
during the year. Some are listed quarterly, others twice a year or
at other intervals. By whatever time period that is used, most
products are currently more expensive than before.
   Two general exceptions to the price creep, according to the
latest report, are prices for field seeds and fertilizer.
   For example, a year ago the USDA said timothy was $82.10 per 100
pounds, compared with $132 in April 1989. Tall fescue dropped to
$85.10 from $111 a year ago, and ``public and common'' alfalfa seed
was $157 per hundredweight against the year-earlier price of $180.
   The index for fuels and other energy prices was up 1.6 percent
from a year ago, although some items showed sharp declines from
earlier this year. Bulk delivered diesel fuel, for example,
averaged 80.7 cents per gallon in April, down 20.3 cents from
January but up 1 cent from a year ago.
   Prices collectively for automobiles and trucks were up 3.5
percent from April 1989, although new trucks in the 1.5- to 2-ton
class and used cars were down slightly. All other vehicle prices
were higher.
   Feeder livestock prices were up 15 percent from April 1989, the
report said. Prices of feeder pigs, at $134 per hundredweight, were
up $41.50 from January.
   For tractors, two-wheel-drive models in the range of 50 to 59
horsepower were shown at $17,700 each, compared with $17,300 last
October and $17,400 a year ago. The 110-129-horsepower models were
$45,300, compared with $44,600 last fall and $43,200 a year ago.
   But the larger four-wheel-drive tractors in the range of 170 to
240 horsepower were reported at $76,600 each, down from $79,500
last fall and $79,700 a year ago.

   The government's Joint Agricultural Weather
Facility says rain has improved the winter wheat outlook in the
northern Great Plains and Pacific Northwest but that more is needed.
   Soil moisture was ``adequate or adequate to surplus'' in the
central and southern plains, while in Arkansas, Missouri and parts
of Texas, rain continued to slow field work, the facility reported
Tuesday.
   Overall, the 1990 winter wheat crop was said to be in ``mostly
good to fair'' condition during the week of April 23-29, with an
estimated 15 percent of the crop headed, which was average for this
time of the season.
   ``Winter wheat was mostly good in Colorado and Montana, good to
fair in Nebraska, and fair to good in South Dakota,'' the report
said.
   The crop was reported good to excellent in Kansas, good in
Oklahoma, and fair to good in Texas.
   Planting of spring wheat was reported 54 percent completed, nine
percentage points ahead of normal. Seeding was 95 percent
completed, in South Dakota, 32 points ahead of normal. In North
Dakota, planting was 37 percent completed, one point ahead of the
usual pace.
   Corn planting was said to be 21 percent complete, five points
behind the average for this time of year. Planting was under way in
all of the major corn states.
   Planting lagged more than 15 percentage points behind normal in
Illinois, Kentucky and Missouri, the report said.
   The facility is operated by the Agriculture and Commerce
departments. Weekly reports cover crop conditions but do not
include production forecasts.

   The Agriculture Department is proposing to
relax the current rules on the imports of some meat and milk from
countries that are free of foot-and-mouth disease and rinderpest.
   Under current regulations, shipments of fresh, chilled and
frozen meat, and milk and milk products must be sealed in the
country of origin, and the seals must be intact when the shipments
arrive in the United States.
   If the shipments stop in countries that have foot-and-mouth and
rinderpest, the cargoes are denied U.S. entry if the seals are
broken.
   James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service, said the proposal to be officially
published today would recognize that the current method of bulk
packaging and containerized shipping is one of the safest means of
handling meat and dairy products.
   The proposal would allow the seal to be placed on a container,
rather than on the entire hold or compartment of a carrier. It also
would establish certain conditions under which the meat or milk
products could remain eligible for U.S. entry if the seal has been
broken or replaced.
   Public comments on the proposal can be sent by July 2 to: Chief,
Regulatory Analysis and Development, PPD, APHIS, USDA, Room 866,
Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, Md. 20782.

<HEAD>Board Authorizes Possible Sale of Plants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Georgia-Pacific Corp.'s board has given
management approval to explore the sale of up to 20 of its mills
and box plants to pay down debt from its $3.74 billion acquisition
of Great Northern Nekoosa Corp.
   Timberland required to support the plants also may be sold, said
Georgia-Pacific Chairman T. Marshall Hahn Jr., who said the
properties ``may not it our long-term strategy.''
   The board approved the measure at a meeting here Tuesday in
conjunction with the Atlanta-based forest products company's annual
shareholders meeting. Hahn said no final decisions have been made
about which plants will be sold.
   Company spokeswoman Sheila Weidman declined to place a value on
the plants that may be sold, although the company said last month
it would sell at least $1 billion in assets to cut costs, raise
capital and reduce debt.
   Analysts quoted in today's editions of The Wall Street Journal
said three mills alone that might be sold could fetch as much as
$1.2 billion.
   Weidman stressed that Georgia-Pacific is not in need of cash to
complete the Great Northern deal. ``The financial arrangements for
the merger weren't based on the sale of assets,'' she said.
   The company said it was considering selling a linerboard mill at
Valdosta, Ga.; a linerboard, corrugating medium and kraft paper
mill at Toledo, Ore.; a corrugating medium mill at Tomahawk, Wis.;
and box plants in East Point, Ga.; Garland, Texas; Milan, Mich.;
Modesto and Los Angeles, Calif.; Newark, Ohio; Newberry, S.C.;
Rutherfordton and Salisbury, N.C.; Milwaukee; Minneapolis; Olympia,
Wash.; Buffalo, N.Y.; Grafton, W.Va.; Miami; Bristol, Pa.; and Gas
City, Ind.
   Weidman said the plants were chosen because of a ``geographic or
product redundancy'' that resulted from the acquisition of Norwalk,
Conn.-based Great Northern.
   Meanwhile, Weidman said the acquisition of Great Northern's
outstanding shares should be complete by the end of June. So far,
Georgia-Pacific has acquired about 96.5 percent, or 53 million, of
the outstanding shares, she said.

<HEAD>Japan's Current Account Surplus Drops Sharply in Fiscal '89</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rapidly growing imports pushed Japan's current
account surplus down 30.8 percent to $53.5 billion in the fiscal
year ended March 31, the Finance Ministry reported Wednesday.
   It was the third consecutive year that there has been a decline
in the surplus in Japan's current account, the widest measure of
its trade flows.
   The surplus was well below the level forecast by government
economists. In February, the Economic Planning Agency predicted it
would register $61 billion.
   Economists attributed the decline largely to the weak Japanese
yen and its impact on prices.
   While a lower yen reduces the value of Japanese exports, there
is a time lag before lower prices result in higher volume. In
addition, higher crude oil prices, measured in dollars, added to
the cost of imports.
   For March, the current account surplus grew to $8.1 billion from
$6.3 billion a year earlier. In March 1989, there had been an
unusual surge in imports before a 3 percent sales tax took effect
the next month, the ministry said.
   Exports were virtually unchanged in fiscal 1989 at $267.9
billion, compared with $267.4 billion the previous year. Imports
surged 14.9 percent to $197.7 billion in the third consecutive year
of double-digit growth, the ministry said. Both were measured on
the basis of settled contracts.
   Robert Alan Feldman, an economist and vice president of Salomon
Brothers Asia, predicted that Japanese exports would revive in the
coming year, sending the current account and trade surpluses
higher. He said export volume was likely to begin growing this
summer as the weaker yen makes Japanese products cheaper overseas.
   In March, the U.S. dollar averaged 148.90 yen, 14 percent higher
than its level a year earlier.
   Meanwhile, in the first 20 days of April, Japan posted a $11.5
million trade deficit, compared to a $3.1 billion surplus a year
earlier, the ministry announced.
   Japan's trade surplus totaled $7.1 billion in March, the latest
full reporting period, up from $6.6 billion a year earlier.
   The current account includes trade in goods and services and
transfer payments, while the trade balance records only trade in
goods. Exports and imports in the current account are measured when
contracts are settled.

   OPEC ministers began an emergency meeting today in
an effort to curb overproduction to help oil prices recover from
their recent sharp drop.
   Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ministers began a
plenary session at about 1 p.m. local time. About half an hour
later, they broke up into smaller negotiating groups, a tactic they
sometimes find more productive.
   All OPEC countries were represented at the session, except Iran,
whose oil minister was expected, said Kemal Saiki, OPEC information
officer.
   ``It is an ongoing circle of consultations,'' Saiki said.
   The gathering was expected to last one or two days.
   Ministers made offered no comments as they began the session.
But they said when they arrived Tuesday that they were aiming for a
quick agreement on voluntary, short-term cuts during May and June.
   How much output to trim and how the reduction should be
allocated among the cartel's 13 members have to be decided.
   Iraq's oil minister, Issam Al-Chalabi on Tuesday pegged current
output at between 23.7 million barrels a day and 24 million barrels
a day, well above the ceiling of 22.1 million barrels a day.
   Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates are the main
quota violators, analysts say. The UAE's oil minister, Mana Saeed
Otaiba, said Tuesday that his country was observing its quota.
   The overproduction has caused a glut just when demand
traditionally slackens in the second quarter, and that has
depressed prices 20 percent since January and well below OPEC's
minimum reference price of $18 a barrel.
   North Sea Brent Blend, the most widely traded international
crude oil, fetched a spot price of $16.60 a barrel in London this
morning, up 10 cents from late Tuesday.
   The average price of a basket of seven crudes monitored by OPEC
stood at $15.37 per 42-gallon barrel last week, down from $17.12 a
barrel in the first week of April, and well below the $18 minimum
reference price.
   OPEC needs to cut its surplus output by as much as 1.5 million
barrels a day to achieve an oil-price recovery, OPEC President
Sadek Boussena said Tuesday.
   Boussena, who also serves as Algeria's oil minister, said: ``The
single target is clear, how to eliminate the surpluses existing in
the market in order to allow a price recovery. It is a single
target and I'm certainly hopeful we can achieve that target.''
   Asked how much output needed to be cut, he responded: It
certainly is something between one and one and a half million
barrels a day.''
   Asked if such a cut would come from current production, he
replied affirmatively.
   Iraq's Chalabi said he was willing to consider reducing the
official production ceiling for the remaining two months of the
half-year, and that all members should contribute to an output cut.
   ``We are prepared to even discuss lowering the ceiling at the
present,'' Chalabi said, adding, ``We are not exceeding our quotas.
We are good guys.''
   The ministers hadn't been expected to address their official
quotas and minimum reference price until they held their full,
regular meeting on June 25.
   Indonesia's oil minister, Ginandjar Kartasasmita, said OPEC
``needs to solve its problem of overproduction quickly. Those
overproducing will have to cut.''
   Saudi Arabia's influential oil minister, Hisham Nazer, said he
wasn't happy with current price levels. ``Yes, we want them
higher,'' he said.
   OPEC's members are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran,
Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.

   A major speculative stock dealer has gone bankrupt
as a result of the sharp plunge of Japanese stock prices this year,
a private credit research agency confirmed Wednesday.
   Akebono Kikaku Co. of Tokyo has accumulated debts exceeding
$1.33 billion and has issued bad notes twice since March 28, said
Teikoku Data Bank Ltd.
   The agency said it was one of the largest bankruptcy cases on
record in Japan.
   Akebono Kikaku's downfall followed the Tokyo market's sharp
plunge this year. Teikoku Data Bank said Akebono was unable to meet
margin calls because of the steep fall in stocks.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock index has skidded 8,742.23 points, or
around 22 percent, from its highest level of 38,915.87 last Dec. 29.
   Many market participants fear that the demise of a few
speculator groups could bankrupt some small securities companies or
cause another selling frenzy on the financial markets.
   Last month, Yamaichi Securities Co., one of Japan's 17 major
securities companies, said it faced a $24 million loss due to one
customer's bankruptcy in March.
   Akebono, founded in 1979 and headed by Komei Tai, dealt in
speculative trading in about 20 stock issues, including those of
chemical, electric power and pharmaceutical companies, while
managing hotels in the downtown Tokyo district of Shinjuku,
according to the Kyodo News Service.

   The stock market edged upward today as traders
awaited details of the government's financing plans.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 8.56 to 2,677.48 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers held a slight edge on losers in nationwide trading of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 377 up, 336 down and
511 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 21.12 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Late today the Treasury was schedule to lay out plans for its
quarterly sale of bonds and notes next week, in which it is
expected to offer more than $30 billion worth of those securities.
   The size of the ``refunding'' and the reception it gets from
investors are seen as pivotal factors determining the near-term
course of interest rates.
   Rates have been climbing lately, in part because of uneasiness
about the Treasury auctions.
   In the credit markets today, prices of long-term government
bonds fell about $2.50 for each $1,000 in face value, increasing
their yields to the 9.05 percent-9.10 percent range.
   Chrysler rose &lsqb; to 15&rsqb; in active trading on top of a }-point
gain Tuesday, when the company reported an 80 percent decline in
first-quarter earnings. Some analysts had expected the profit
showing to be worse than it turned out.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .34 to 2,677.48. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .10 at 343.42.
   On Tuesday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 12.16 to

   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 6 to 5 on the

   Whirlpool Corp. said Wednesday it is
combining several units into one subsidiary that will handle
marketing outside North America and Europe.
   The new unit, Whirlpool Overseas Corp., will combine the
company's Benton Harbor-based export sales group with its overseas
business group in Comerio, Italy. It also will include four wholly
owned sales companies in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Thailand and Australia,
the company said.
   The Comerio operation had been part of Whirlpool International
B.V., formed by Whirlpool's joint venture with N.V. Philips of the
Netherlands in 1989. The four sales companies also were acquired in
the joint venture.
   ``The distinct focus of Whirlpool Overseas Corp. makes it
neither an exclusively North American export nor European export
organization but rather one responsible for market penetration of
all corporation brands in overseas markets,'' said Lawrence J.
Kremer, senior vice president for global technology and operations.
   Appliances marketed by the overseas group include KitchenAid,
Whirlpool, Roper, Ignis, Bauknecht and those carrying the dual
Whirlpool and Philips brand.
   Whirlpool manufactures appliances in 10 countries and markets
them in 45. The company reported consolidated net earnings of
$187.2 million on consolidated net revenues of $6.29 billion in
1989.

   The government's chief economic forecasting
gauge rose 0.9 percent in March, its biggest increase in nearly two
years, the government said today.
   The gain in the Index of Leading Economic Indicators, designed
to forecast economic activity six to nine months in the future,
meant the gauge nearly regained the 1.0 percent loss it suffered in
February.
   It was the steepest increase since a 1.6 percent gain in June
1988. Before dropping in February, the index had risen for three
straight months.
   But while the gauge was up in March, some analysts were
concerned that rising inflation, if it does not force the Federal
Reserve to increase interest rates, certainly will not encourge the
central bank to lower them.
   High rates would slow further the already sluggish construction,
auto and manufacturing sectors of the economy.
   ``We're looking for a slowdown in activity in the second and
third quarters due primarily to high interest rates,'' said Paul
Getman, an economist with Regional Financial Associates in West
Chester, Pa.
   ``We'll have an extremely sluggish construction sector and
lackluster activity elsewhere, including business investment, which
has been pretty good,'' he added.
   Indeed, construction, which relies on low-cost loans, slowed
even before the start of the second quarter. The Commerce
Department reported on Tuesday that construction spending dropped
1.4 percent in March, its steepest decline in more than a year.
   But in a second report today, the department said orders to
factories for manufactured goods rose 3.8 percent in March,
continuing to rebound from a 5.5 percent decline in January, the
steepest fall since a 7 percent decrease in December 1974.
   The March gain was the largest in more than a year and, together
with February's 1.8 percent advance, offset the January decline.
   Six of the 11 forward-looking statistics contributed to the
increase in today's leading indicators, led by a gain in new plant
and equipment orders.
   Other positives were an increase in the price of raw materials,
an increase in orders for consumer goods, higher stock prices,
slower business delivery times and a drop in weekly unemployment
claims.
   Negatives included a decrease in building permits, a decline in
the backlog of manufacturers unfilled orders and a drop in the
money supply.
   Two of the components were unchanged: the average workweek and
an index measuring consumer confidence.
   The various changes left the index at 145.2 percent of its 1982
base of 100. The index edged up 0.1 percent from October through
March on top of a 0.2 percent gain the previous six months.
   Although many analysts see slow growth ahead, there is virtual
unanimity that the economy has avoided a recession.
   ``The business cycle trough is pretty much behind us,''
contended Kermit Baker, director of economics at Cahners Economics
in Newton, Mass. ``Any risk of recession prettty much ended with
the first-quarter (GNP) report. You're not going to hear too many
recession forecasts cropping up over the next few months.''
   The first-quarter gross national product _ the nation's total
output of goods and services _ rose 2.1 percent, compared to a 3.0
percent increase for all of 1989, according to a Commerce
Department report last week.
   That was much stronger growth than many economists had predicted
as the year began. At that time, many forecast GNP growth would be
little improved from the fourth quarter's 1.1 percent rate, the
slowest in three years. Some even said the economy could topple
into a recession.
   But despite the surprising strength, the report also contained
bad news on the inflation front _ a 6.5 percent annual rate, the
steepest increase since 1981 and up sharply from the 4.5 percent in
1989.
   Interest rates were pushed up starting in December 1988 by the
Federal Reserve as it sought to curb inflation by tightening
credit. As inflation seemed to moderate, the central bank permitted
short-term rates to ease during the second half of 1989.
   But many economists now fear the Fed may have no choice but to
retighten credit to keep inflationary pressures under control.

   The stock market crept ahead today as traders
awaited details of the government's quarterly financing plans.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 1.13 to 2,670.05 by
11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 6 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 628 up, 521 down and
540 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 45.42 million shares at
midmorning.
   Late today the Treasury was schedule to spell out plans for its
quarterly sale of bonds and notes next week, in which it is
expected to offer more than $30 billion worth of those securities.
   The size of the ``refunding'' and the reception it gets from
investors are widely seen as pivotal influences on the near-term
course of interest rates.
   Rates have been climbing lately, in part because of uneasiness
about the Treasury auctions.
   In the credit markets today, prices of long-term government
bonds fell about $2.50 for each $1,000 in face value, increasing
their yields to the 9.05 percent-9.10 percent range.
   Chrysler rose &rsqb; to 15| in active trading on top of a }-point
gain Tuesday, when the company reported an 80 percent decline in
first-quarter earnings. Some analysts had expected the profit
showing to be worse than it turned out.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .17 to 182.39. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was off .48 at 342.84.

<HEAD>Wheat Futures Rise On China News</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat futures prices rose this morning on the
Chicago Board of Trade after the Agriculture Department announced
it had targeted China for sales of 2 million metric tons of U.S.
wheat at subsidized prices.
   Soybean futures were lower while corn futures were narrowly
mixed in early trading.
   The USDA had been rumored to be planning large offers of export
bonus wheat to several countries, including China. But the size of
the offer announced this morning was `` a little higher than they
had anticipated,'' said Joel Karlin, an analyst with Research
Department Inc., a commodity research firm in Chicago.
   The wheat market drew further support from extremely wet weather
in the Southern Plains that threatens to delay the winter harvest
and possibly reduce crop yields, Karlin said.
   Soybeans were down slightly after Tuesday's rollercoaster action
that saw prices zoom to nine-month highs and then collapse to close
lower.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1{ cents to 3 cents higher
with the contract for delivery in May at $3.69 a bushel; corn was \
cent lower to { cent higher with May at $2.83{ a bushel; oats were
\ cent lower to \ cent higher with May at $1.65 a bushel; soybeans
were 3 cents lower to 1{ cents higher with May at $6.26{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .05 cent to .35 cent higher with June at 73.57
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .03 cent to .20 cent higher with
May at 82.75 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent lower to .23
cent higher with June at 63.75 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .25 cent lower to 1.20 cents higher with May at 69.85 cents a
pound.
   Cattle futures settled mixed on Tuesday; pork futures were
sharply higher.

<HEAD>Another Bad Trip For Bond Funds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If you put your money in a conservative,
high-yielding investment that offers convenience, liquidity and
diversification of your money, how can you lose?
   For one answer to that question, ask the legions of people who
have owned shares of bond funds and other income mutual funds
through the first four months of 1990.
   While these funds, which have aggregate assets of $300 billion,
have been earning current yields of 8 percent to 9 percent or more
from their holdings of such things as Treasury securities and
high-grade corporate bonds, their typical ``total return'' to
investors of late has been less than zero.
   From Jan. 1 through April 26, an index of 535 income funds
calculated by Lipper Analytical Services Inc., assuming
reinvestment of dividends, showed a loss of 2.57 percent.
   What went wrong for these funds was a rise in the general level
of long-term interest rates that almost no one had predicted.
   Going rates on long-term Treasury bonds climbed from below 8
percent at New Year's to 9 percent in late April.
   Increasing rates on new fixed-income securities coming to market
forced the prices of existing bonds downward by about 10 percent or
more, in turn depressing the net asset values of the funds that
owned those bonds.
   Yield-conscious investors with a true long-term perspective
might be inclined to take all this in stride. They continue to get
their current income, after all, and they retain the hope that
their principal will recoup its lost value should interest rates
turn downward again.
   But they have no assurance that those hopes will be fulfilled
within any given period of time. The interest-rate volatility of
the late 1970s and 1980s, quite apparently, has persisted into the
early months of the 1990s undiminished.
   ``Once again, an unexpected rise in long-term interest rates
confounded experts who were anticipating a totally different set of
events,'' said Vincent Agnew, an investment manager at Chicago
Title and Trust Co.
   For people considering new fund investments, the latest
developments have their positive side. Because of the rise in
rates, their money now can command higher current yields than
before.
   Perhaps even more important, rates on short-term securities like
Treasury bills have risen only slightly while long-term rates
jumped. So for the first time in two or three years, the yield
curve representing the range of maturities in the credit markets is
no longer flat.
   Thus, investors in interest-bearing securities are starting to
see at least some modest extra reward for taking the risk that goes
with tying up their money for an extended period of time. As of the
beginning of May, yields on Treasury bonds exceeded yields on bills
by more than three-quarters of a percentage point.
   But if that improves the odds a little, it still gives no
assurance of any sure bets for mutual-fund investors. If long-term
rates keep rising, income funds' net asset values will keep losing
ground.
   Wright Investors Service of Bridgeport, Conn., argues that
high-quality bonds are attractive right now on the basis of ``good
potential for sharply lower yields and higher bond prices by
yearend.''
   At Chicago Title, analysts take a warier view: ``The argument
for lower U.S. interest rates was predicated on a sluggish economy
accompanied by declining inflationary pressures.
   ``It's possible that the consensus view might still prevail. But
don't count on it.''

<TEXT>
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said
today that world trade talks had entered a crucial period with a
variety of disputes still to be resolved.
   Hills was in California for talks with trade ministers from
Japan, the 12-nation European Community and Canada over ways to
resolve contentious issues blockikng completion of a round of
trade-liberalization talks.
   The trade officials hope the three days of discussions will
inject a new sense of urgency into the negotiations, which have
been under way since 1986.
   If common ground is not reached, there are fears that the most
ambitious round of trade-liberalization talks ever undertaken could
end in failure.
   ``1990 is a pivotal year for the world economy,'' Hills said.
``Down one path lie open markets, expanded trade, economic growth
and prosperity. Down the other lie closed markets, nations turned
inward and gravely diminished prosperity for all.''
   Hills, speaking to a convention of business reporters and
editors, appealed to the news media to do a better job of covering
trade issues.
   She said reporters over-emphasize stories on trade frictions
with such countries as Japan and downplay more significant stories
such as the effort to negotiate a new global trade agreement.
   Hills appeared before the Society of American Business Editors
and Writers before the trade talks got underway at a resort in
Napa, Calif.
   The talks, which were launched almost four years ago in Uruguay,
are being held under the auspices of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, the 96-nation group that governs world trade.
   The Uruguay Round is scheduled to be completed in early
December, but with a little over 200 days left, deep disagreement
still divides the negotiators.
   The Bush administration has made a new global trade agreement
its top trade priority this year, and Hills has portrayed possible
failure of the talks in stark economic terms.
   She has warned that without major reforms the trading system
that produced four decades of global prosperity could disintegrate
into protectionism and shrinking living standards for both
industrial and developing countries.
   ``The accords we seek are essential to our future prosperity,''
Hills said. ``It may be the last, best chance this century to
create the trading rules we need for the next century.''
   The administration is counting on the reforms to attack a U.S.
trade deficit that has topped $100 billion for six consecutive
years.
   Hills has estimated that tearing down protectionist farm
barriers worldwide could boost U.S. farm exports by $11 billion
annually _ amounting to $3,400 for every farmer.
   Similarly, strengthening rules to protect against patent and
copyright piracy could pump $60 billion annually into U.S.
corporate coffers, the administration estimates.
   The other big item on America's wish list is removal of barriers
to trade in services, a fast-growing part of world trade where
experts believe the deficit could be lowered by opening foreign
markets to U.S. banks, securities firms and insurance companies.
   But the U.S. negotiating package has met with resistance.
   The 12-nation European Community, with its politically powerful
collection of small family farms, is strenuously resisting the
American call for a timetable to phase out all trade-distorting
farm subsides.
   Third World countries, led by India and Brazil, are fighting the
effort to remove barriers blocking foreign banks and other service
companies for fear that giant multinational firms will overwhelm
their domestic institutions.
   There was no clear indication what will come from the three days
of discussions, being held at a plush resort in Napa, Calif.
   Officials hope, at the very least, to come closer to common
ground in some areas to give guidance to lower-level negotiators,
who will meet in Geneva, Switzerland, in July for a critical
drafting session.
   It is quite likely that some of the thorniest problems will have
to be taken up when President Bush hosts America's major allies at
the seven-nation economic summit this summer in Houston.
   The final negotiations will be held Dec. 3-7 in Brussels, but
without substantial movement before that time, there are concerns
that the final round of talks could collapse, given the complexity
of the issues being addressed.

<HEAD>Corporate Management Myths</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It is still true that the surest way to the top
of a large American industrial corporation is to find a relatively
low level job and work your way up.
   No, it is not a myth.
   The myth, created in recent decades, is that it's now more
common to move into the top job by bouncing from one company to
another, eventually leveraging into the chairman's office.
   But Eugene Jennings, examining his research all the way back to
1939 _ it is the largest corporate mobility data base of its kind _
finds that it is now far more common to name a chief from within
the company.
   That finding upsets what has become a ``given'' in many popular
accounts of making it to the top. But it is conclusive.
   Jennings, who pioneered so-called mobility studies, says that
three out of four individuals named to the top spot in the 1980s
were what he calls natives, compared with only 48 percent in the
decade of the 1960s.
   The professor _ professor emeritus of management, Michigan State
University _ set out in the late 1940s to study mobility patterns,
or ascendancy routes in industrial America. In effect, his interest
was ``making it in America.''
   Because this was his intent, he excluded ``birth elites'' and
``privileged elites'' _ namely founders, children of founders and
investors and their proxies, who probably entered the company by
raiding it or buying it.
   With these exclusions, he was able to concentrate on mobility
patterns and trace the routes to corporate success.
   He found that in every category he defined, natives were more
likely than so-called migrants to head America's large industrial
corporations, and that the pattern was becoming even more
pronounced.
   He found, for example, that natives outscore migrants in every
age group, among the early arrivals or those who achieve the top
job at 49 years or younger, normals (age 50 to 57.5 years) and late
arrivals (58 years or more).
   In spite of what some executive recruiters might like to hear,
he found that even when migrants assumed the top job, they rarely
did so without first becoming subordinates and working their way up
from there.
   Age and experience, he found in his review, remain extremely
important in naming a chief. The widely held notion that chief
executive officers are younger these day is also a myth. The fact
is precisely the opposite.
   To illustrate: Since the 1960s, the average age at which chiefs
are appointed has risen steadily and is now more than 58 years. In
that time, the number of younger chief executives has declined.
   Tenure has risen; chiefs remain in the job longer than they used
to. Tenure during the 1960s was less than seven years on average.
It is now more than nine years and rising. Increasingly, boards
waive compulsory retirement rules.
   It is a myth too, says Jennings, that corporate boards turn to
migrant chiefs when the company is in trouble. No, he says, they
turn to natives. The facts suggest older, experienced, home-grown
chiefs are treasured by boards.
   A popular notion is that more chiefs of U.S. industrial
companies have had global experience, the better to deal with the
emerging global economy. To some extent, the impression is false.
   Jennings found, for instance, that fewer rather than more chiefs
have had the experience of living and working abroad for the
company. No, he says, while they have experience running foreign
operations, they've done it from home.
   As popularly described, he says, ``The global manager is a
myth.'' He finds instead that industrial companies have been
developing native managers who report to the U.S. office rather
than sending home-office managers abroad.
   Jennings, who for three decades has advised corporate chairmen
on the grooming of potential successors, began his studies with
live data in 1949 and researched records back to 1939.
   From that data have come numerous books, including the seminal
``Mobile Manager'' in 1964, and ``Routes To The Executive Suite''
and ``Executives in Crisis'' in the 1970s.

<HEAD>EC Proposes Anti-Pollution Measures for Trucks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Community's executive
Commission proposed measures Wednesday to significantly reduce
pollution from diesel trucks.
   Carlo Ripa di Meana, EC commissioner for the environment, said
if approved by EC governments and the European Parliament, the
proposal would force all trucks in the 12-nation trade bloc to cut
their emissions of carbon dioxide by more than half.
   Hydrocarbons also would be cut by half and nitrogen oxides by
slightly less than half, making EC diesel trucks as clean as those
from Austria and Switzerland.
   In the two Alpine nations, trucks producing more than 82
decibels are banned between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m., and Ripa di Meana
plans to propose similar curbs on noise pollution this fall.
   New anti-pollution norms will be introduced in Austria and
Switzerland on Oct. 1, 1991. EC hauliers were worried the new norms
would affect their transit through the two nations.
   Ripa di Meana said his proposal had been ``prepared in full
consultation with the truck industry.'' These talks had revealed
that the technology to reduce pollution from diesel engines was
available in the 12-nation trade bloc so new norms could be
mandatory by Oct. 1, 1991.
   Ripa di Meana said he would also propose legislation to cut the
amount of sulphur in diesel this fall.

<TEXT>
   American General Corp., embroiled in a bitter
proxy battle with Torchmark Corp. for control of the company, said
today that it was putting itself up for sale.
   In a surprise annoucement at the annual shareholders' meeting,
Chairman Harold S. Hook said American General was vulnerable to
possible acquisitions at a discount price and it decided to offer
itself for sale to realize the maximum value for stockholders.
   Hook said that if the company isn't sold in one piece, the board
of directors would be prepared to sell off assets.
   By late morning on the New York Stock Exchange, American General
was off 12.5 cents to $40 a share. Torchmark was up 87.5 cents to
$44.50 a share on the NYSE.
   The decision to sell the company was made late Tuesday,
according to Hook, on the eve of today's crucial proxy vote in
which Torchmark is seeking to elect its own slate of directors to
the board.
   Hook said the company couldn't announce its decision to sell the
company until today when shareholders cast their ballots.
   ``We are confident we elected our slate of directors,'' Hook
said to the shareholders' applause. ``I wish that was the end of
the story.''
   Torchmark has been waging a proxy fight to elect five nominees
to the 15-member board since it withdrew an unsolicited $6.34
billion cash and stock offer for American General.
   Torchmark Chairman Ron Richey said he was pleased with today's
announcement. ``From the outset, our objective has been to
negotiate a transaction with American General, and we look forward
to sitting down with them to discuss a merger proposal,'' he said
in a statement.
   American General officials had vigorously urged shareholders to
vote for the company's own slate of directors. It also had resisted
efforts by Torchmark to hire an investment bank and appoint a panel
of independent directors to evaluate acquisition proposals.
   The outcome of today's proxy vote won't be known immediately. It
will take up to two weeks before the final tally is announced
because every proxy must be counted by hand, American General
spokesman John Pluhowski said.
   Houston-based American General, with subsidiaries that operate
in 50 states and Canada, is battling with the much smaller
Birmingham, Ala.-based Torchmark, which is best known for its
Liberty National Mutual Insurance subsidiary.
   American General has assets of $32 billion. Torchmark, with
assets of $5 billion, has set aside $15 million for the proxy fight.
   A federal judge in Tennessee allowed Torchmark to continue its
proxy fight on Tuesday, one day after a state commissioner ordered
an end to the battle. Today a federal appeals court upheld that
decision.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas A. Wiseman said Tennessee Revenue
Commissioner Joe Huddleston had overreached his authority and
interfered with the rights of American General stockholders to vote
their shares.
   Torchmark representatives also said that an Indiana Superior
Court judge had delayed an administrative hearing on the proxy
battle in that state until next Monday.
   Huddleston had ruled Monday that Torchmark violated Tennessee
law by soliciting proxies for its board nominees. He said state
insurance law forbids a company from seeking to control a Tennessee
company without prior approval of the state Department of Commerce
and Insurance.
   But attorney William Leech said Torchmark simply wants five
directors on the American General board who will listen to
discussions about merging the two companies. He said election of
one-third of the directors falls short of a takeover.
   Tennessee is one of 10 states in which American General is
considered domiciled because of operations there. Regulators in
Texas and New York as well as Tennessee have questioned the

<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar, trading in a slack market because
of continuing May Day holidays, ended mixed in Europe today.
   Gold prices also firmed.
   Traders said the dollar's rise against all currencies except the
British pound, Japanese yen and Swiss franc mostly reflected
changes in currency cross rates rather than any specific trend.
   They said the news that East and West Germany had agreed on key
terms of their July 2 monetary union caused some excitement and set
off selling in West German marks.
   In Tokyo, the dollar eased against the yen from 158.90 yen late
Tuesday to 158.55. In London, the dollar traded lower at 158.25 yen.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6435, more expensive for
buyers than Tuesday's late $1.6385.
   Dealers said that after weeks of opinion polls reporting
slumping support for Britain's governing Conservatives, the markets
were prepared to see Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's party take
big losses in Thursday's local government elections. They said the
pound was holding up despite that because of Britain's high
interest rates.
   Other late European dollar rates, compared with late Tuesday's
rates included: 1.6823 West German marks, up from 1.6785; 1.4535
Swiss francs, down from 1.4545; 5.6425 French francs, up from
5.6365; 1.8910 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8892; 1,232.25 Italian
lire, up from 1,231.25, and 1.1672 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1635.
   Selected midday dollar rates in New York included: 158.20
Japanese yen, 1.4530 Swiss francs, 1.6845 West German marks,
1,233.50 Italian lire, and 1.1674 Canadian dollars.
   Gold bullion prices rose in light trading.
   In London, gold closed at $369.25 bid a troy ounce, up from
$368.50. The closing Zurich bid price was $368.85, up from $367.00
late Monday. Zurich markets were closed Tuesday for May Day.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $370.55 dollars, up from
$369.45.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid price of $5.02 a
troy ounce, up from $4.97.

   Share prices finished higher in light trading
Wednesday on London's Stock Exchange.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed up
19.7 points, or 0.9 percent, at 2,137.6. Volume was 433 million
shares, up from 370.8 million a day earlier.
   Caution about Britain's economic and political situation,
currently focused on Thursday's scheduled municipal elections in
which Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Party is
forecast to take a drubbing, is damping new investor enthusiasm at
the moment, traders said.
   Dealers said the technical bounce that gripped the market at the
start of the week probably has run its course.
   Bidding speculation buoyed the insurance sector, as expectations
that French group Axa Midi might try for a British composite
insurer following the collapse last week of Axa Midi's efforts to
buy BAT Industries PLC's U.S. insurance unit, Farmers Group.
   Favorable results by the Royal Bank of Scotland bolstered
banking shares, which have been depressed since Midland Bank
released a profit warning last week.

   Smirnoff, the vodka favored by czars that
was banished during the Russian revolution, is back in the U.S.S.R.
   Heublein Inc. said Wednesday it has taken advantage of easing
East-West trade restraints to ship Smirnoff back to the Soviet
Union, where it was first distilled in the 1800s.
   Heublein, a liquor and wine company based in Farmington, has
been bottling vodka under the Smirnoff name in the United States
for more than 50 years, acquiring the formula from Russian exiles
in the 1930s.
   Peter Smirnoff first distilled his vodka in 1818 in Moscow and
through the century became the official supplier of vodka and
liqueurs to the court of Imperial Russia, Heublein spokeswoman
Vivian Brooks said.
   But the Bolshevik party, led by Vladimir I. Lenin, took control
of the government in 1917, and Moscow's businesses and industries
were seized by the Red Army.
   Vladimir Smirnoff, then running the family distillery, was
jailed and sentenced to death as a symbol of czarist oppression.
   Smirnoff was rescued by the White Army _ which represented the
nobility and others opposing the revolution _ and made his way to
France. In the early 1930s, he sold the family formula to Rudolph
Kunett, another Russian exile.
   Kunett made his way to the United States and set up a vodka
distillery in Bethel, later selling the operation to Heublein in
1939.
   Selling vodka to the Soviets might seem a bit like the old joke
about selling refrigerators to Eskimos or bringing coals to
Newcastle. But Brooks said that ``from a lifestyle point of view,
Russians look to Smirnoff as an American symbol, which in a way is
ironic.''
   Heublein launched an advertising campaign Tuesday with the theme
``Back in the U.S.S.R.''
   ``The new advertisement is our way of toasting the new openness
in East-West relations,'' said Charles Traynor, vice president of
marketing for Heublein's John G. Martin unit. Martin bought the
Smirnoff formula and rights for Heublein in 1939.

   The stock market headed higher today as traders
awaited details of the government's quarterly financing plans.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 11.26 to 2,680.18

   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 778 up, 574 down and

   The size of the ``refunding'' and the reception it gets from
investors are widely seen as pivotal influences on the near-term

<HEAD>Braniff Wants to Sell Aircraft Contracts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Braniff Inc. hopes to gain at least $50
million from the sale of aircraft contracts, pay off some of its
debts and wrap up bankruptcy proceedings soon, officials say.
   The airline has asked a federal bankruptcy judge for
authorization to sell contracts to purchase 24 Airbus A320 jets,
plus its options to buy 50 more planes and spare parts.
   If permission is granted, lawyers say, most of the proceeds
would be used to pay debts. Another $11 million may come from
auctions of ground-support equipment and other assets in Orlando,
Dallas and Kansas City, Mo.
   No hearing has yet been scheduled on Braniff's request.
   Preliminary estimates indicate that Braniff's creditors might
get 10 cents or less for each dollar they are owed. The airline's
estimated total debt is $450 million.
   Orlando-based Braniff filed for Chapter 11 protection from
creditors last Sept. 28. Since then, it has halted operations,
dismissed most of its 4,800 employees and disposed of most of its
assets.
   The contracts and options to purchase the jets _ which have been
in dispute with the aircraft manufacturers _ are considered
Braniff's most valuable assets.
   The prospective buyers are AVSA S.A.R.L. and Airbus Service Co.
Inc., both affiliates of Airbus Industrie, the European consortium
that manufactures the aircraft. As part of the agreement, those
companies and Braniff would settle lawsuits against each other.
   ``The creditors are pleased with the proposal and hope that it's
a beginning for an even higher offer,'' said Harry Lewis, a New
York lawyer representing the unsecured creditors' committee.
   Commenting on the possibility of a 10-cent return for each
dollar of debt, Lewis said Tuesday that was ``average, but a heck
of a lot better than zero. And we were looking at getting nothing
back earlier in this case.''

<TEXT>
   Now that most major companies rely heavily on
computers, the next step in the computerization of industry
involves getting these computers to ``talk'' with each other.
   Such linkups among computers at different companies are called
electronic data interchange, or EDI. Though EDI has been around for
years, it has yet to become widespread outside of a few industries.
But once it does, U.S. industry could save billions of dollars a
year, experts say.
   EDI systems can automate much of the routine business between
companies and their customers and suppliers. Electronic messages
passed between computers can replace purchase orders, bills of
lading, shipping slips and other paperwork.
   ``We know in 10 years this is going to be the way companies
operate,'' said Thomas P. Colberg, an EDI consultant at Price
Waterhouse, a large New York accounting firm.
   One leading EDI user is Levi Strauss &amp; Co., the San
Francisco-based jeans maker.
   Through EDI, a computer at a retail store can automatically
reorder goods from Levi's based on what has been sold. In turn, a
computer at Levi's automatically ships the goods and bills the
store for the items. Little or no human intervention is required.
   EDI also can be linked to an automatic payment technique called
electronic funds transfer. Through such a system, for example,
Sears, Roebuck and Co. pays for shipments from Levi's by having its
computer automatically credit a Levi's bank account.
   Soon, Levi's plans to add another layer of EDI, in which its
computers will automatically reorder raw materials such as fabric
and thread based on the orders from retailers.
   ``It's as if that entire chain _ the retailer, the manufacturer
and the supplier to the manufacturer _ as if they are one company.
The consumer buys and it goes right through to the manufacturer,''
said Paul Benchener, who is in charge of Levi's EDI system.
   ``It's exciting. It's changing the way that business will be
done in the future,'' he said.
   EDI is not the same as electronic mail, in which a computer's
human users send electronic messages to each other. With EDI, the
need for humans is greatly reduced.
   EDI slashes the time required to reorder goods, and because
goods arrive more quickly, it can dramatically reduce the amount of
goods that must be kept on hand in warehouses.
   The technology also virtually eliminates the errors that can
crop up when orders are entered into computers by hand.
   At Levi Strauss, computers order up production of jeans at the
company's plants to match incoming orders. Because of the precision
in ordering jeans, Levis' can order the exact amount of cloth,
zippers and thread needed to make jeans to replace those just
shipped.
   That has allowed Levi's to drastically reduce the amount of
supplies stored at sewing plants. ``In some cases we don't have any
supply on hand,'' Benchener said.
   In turn, some Levi's customers have been able to sharply reduce
their storage space devoted to jeans and other items because of the
speed and precision with which they can get new supplies delivered.
The ability to quickly reorder popular items in the most-wanted
sizes and colors is a particular benefit to retailers, Benchener
said.
   These delivery techniques, called just-in-time inventory control
or quick response, were popularized by Japanese manufacturers.
   Sears says that due mostly to EDI, the retailer has reduced the
storage space in newer stores to 20 percent of total area, vs. 50
percent once set aside for storage.
   ``We no longer are going to be using the stores as warehouses,''
said Lance Dailey, who runs Sears' EDI operation.
   The savings in paperwork have been just as dramatic, Dailey said.
   ``About half our invoices are electronic. It would be reasonable
to expect that if we didn't have EDI we'd have to have double the
staff to process our invoices,'' he said.
   Benchener said Levi Strauss implemented EDI more as a way to
boost sales than to cut costs, but the company has benefited in
both areas. The main advantage is that it freed up much of the time
salespeople once spent completing customer orders by hand.
   ``What we've done is increased our sales but with the same
(number of) sales reps,'' Benchener said.
   About 40 percent of Levi's orders now come in electronically, he
said.
   One hurdle in establishing an EDI system is getting companies
accustomed to the idea of paying for goods without a slip of paper,
or invoice, proving they received them, said Colberg. This practice
is upsetting to some accountants and auditors, who like to have
paper receipts to verify accounts.
   David Atlas, an analyst at International Data Corp., said
concern about paper documents may be misplaced. ``Just because you
have something electronically doesn't also mean you can't have
paper copies,'' he said.
   In addition, electronic transactions usually are recorded on
magnetic tape or computer discs.
   A bigger obstacle preventing more widespread adoption of EDI is
that industry has yet to agree on a standard for the systems, said
Guy Fisher, EDI marketing manager for General Electric Co.'s GE
Information Services, the nation's largest EDI network.
   As a result, he said, incompatible EDI systems are used, meaning
a company using one system usually can't exchange electronic
documents with a company using another without first translating it
through special computer software.
   Analysts said EDI has gained wide acceptance in a few
industries, such as aerospace, autos, retailing, pharmaceuticals,
oil and banking. But when compared with the overall volume of
routine business transactions, EDI remains a small fraction.
   Input, a Mountain View, Calif., market research firm, says the
domestic EDI market totaled about $280 million last year, including
fees for use of EDI networks, related software and professional
services. Input projects the market will grow about 40 percent a
year through 1994.
   Input's figures do not include the in-house EDI systems
established by the three major automakers and several large
retailers.
   Fisher predicts the next major industry that will adopt EDI
widely is transporatation and shipping. He said the paper-based
system this industry uses is ``a monstrosity'' that could be
substantially streamlined through EDI.

<HEAD>Kodak Earnings Dip 6 Percent in First Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILARY APPELMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastman Kodak Co. said Wednesday its
first-quarter earnings dipped 6 percent, while sales fell slightly.
   Kodak Chairman Colby H. Chandler said he still expects to see
positive results from the company's major restructuring last year
in the second half of 1990.
   ``Barring unexpected developments in the economy, we believe the
recovery forecast for Kodak will come about,'' Chandler said.
   A strong showing by Kodak's core imaging segment was offset by
lower profits in its chemicals and information segments, the
company said.
   ``While first-quarter results were slightly below those reported
at this time last year, they are consistent with the company's
business plan for 1990, which calls for higher sales and earnings
for the full year,'' he said.
   Income for the quarter ending March 31 was $199 million, or 61
cents per share, compared to $212 million, or 65 cents per share,
in the first quarter of 1989.
   Sales for the first quarter dipped 2 percent to $4.1 billion
from $4.2 billion in the same period last year. Chandler said sales
would have been about level if an extra week of business activity
had been excluded from the first quarter of 1989.
   Figures for 1989 were restated to reflect the company's change
from a 13-period to a 12-month calendar year.
   The Rochester-based photographic giant began a $549 million
restructuring in 1989, selling or consolidating about 20 businesses
and eliminating 7,500 jobs.
   Chandler has said he expects to see the restructuring translate
into better earnings and improved cash flows in the second half of
1990.
   David Nelson, an industry analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc. in New York, said the first-quarter drop was not unexpected.
   ``The numbers are mixed, but on balance positive,'' Nelson said.
``The improvements from last year's restructuring have not hit the
income statement yet.''
   In the first quarter, ``Kodak margins held steady, cash flow was
positive, and debt was reduced,'' Chandler said.
   Earnings improved by more than 50 percent in the company's core
imaging segment because of lower operating costs and higher prices.
Profits dropped 38 percent in the chemicals segment and 20 percent
in the information segment.
   Chandler blamed the decline in chemicals earnings on high raw
material costs and a power outage that shut down the company's
Kingsport, Tenn., plant temporarily.
   The information segment was affected by a soft U.S. market for
business equipment, he said. Health segment earnings declined 3
percent for the quarter.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed sharply

prospects of new wheat sales to China.
   The Agriculture Department announced Wednesday morning it had

   The wheat market also was supported by concerns that heavy rains
in Texas and Oklahoma could cause winter wheat harvest delays and

   But there was no fresh supply-and-demand news behind the rally
in the soybean and corn markets, which advanced amid heavy
speculative fund buying linked to bullish chart patterns.

<HEAD>Boss Man of the Border: Don Agapito, Mexican Labor Leader</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOEL WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MATAMOROS, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Since 1936, when he rose to the
formidable position as union boss in this border city, businesses
and politicians have sought favor with Agapito Gonzalez Cavazos.
   A big, jowly, potbellied man who charms unionists with his
charisma and brags about his fourth-grade education, Gonzalez
remains steadfast in the role of working-class advocate.
   He dresses simply in faded clothes and describes the
labor-management relationship in the same rhetoric as five decades
ago: an us-and-them struggle.
   The 74-year-old regional general secretary of the Confederation
of Mexican Workers says he takes his orders from the workers, whom
he calls ``los muchachos,'' or ``the youngsters.'' Rank-and-file
union members respond with Don Agapito, a title of respect reserved
for the elderly.
   But operators of Matamoros' mostly U.S.-owned assembly plants,
known as maquiladoras, describe Gonzalez as an example of an
influential labor leader who has lost track of the times, a relic
on a collision course with President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's
effort to reform and modernize Mexico's economy.
   Gonzalez, who controls the labor supply for the plants, says he
doesn't trust the maquiladora plants, historicaly one of the
fastest growing areas of U.S. business expansion into Mexico. The
plants assemble everything from computer disks to cassette tapes to
automobile windshield wiper blades.
   ``They come to exploit us,'' Gonzales said. ``They do not come
to help us.''
   Yet there are indications the Mexican government wants to
throttle Gonzalez and Mexico's other labor bosses, or ``caciques,''
a Mexican term meaning chieftains.
   Last year, in Ciudad Madero about 250 miles down the coast from
Matamoros, Mexican troops blasted their way into a house to arrest
oil union chief Joaquin Hernandez Galicia on corruption charges.
   Later in the year, in Reynosa, about 50 miles west of Matamoros,
state and federal governments helped rival union organizer Abel
Hernandez successfully challenge would-be cacique Rafael Morales,
who wanted his local to hold a monopoly on the city's maquiladora
workers.
   In January, when Gonzalez threatened strikes that could have
idled up to 60,000 workers at maquiladoras and related industries
around Matamoros, the government allowed the talks to move to
Mexico City without Gonzalez's participation.
   The companies won concessions allowing them to move equipment to
and from their plants and to discipline workers without union
permission. Pay raises were held to 15 percent instead of the 25
percent the union had demanded.
   Two weeks later, auditors from the Treasury Department in Mexico
City showed up at Gonzalez' headquarters and took a truckload of
files back to the capital. Treasury officials refused to discuss
why, but the move raised speculation the government might use the
threat of investigation to keep Gonzales in line.
   ``The federal government is really fed up with this guy because
of the harassment he's given our companies and the bad name he's
given Mexico in general,'' said Jim Ebersole, industrial
development director with the Economic Development Council in
Brownsville, Texas, across the Rio Grande from Matamoros.
   The labor leader and his defenders maintain that workers are
getting squeezed in inflation-racked Mexico.
   ``A modernization requires a modernization of salaries also,''
said Vicente Sanchez, an economics researcher at the Colegio
Frontera del Norte in Matamoros. ``Who will negotiate for the
workers, if not the labor leaders?''
   Industrial managers say Gonzalez' tactics drive away those who
would open new plants in Matamoros.
   ``You know what the muchachos say?'' Gonzalez responded. ``Let
them leave, because we don't want them here. We won't put up with
them any more.''
   Most Mexican workers at the plants spend an entire day earning
what U.S. employees make in an hour, he said.
   Joe Lacambra, president of management's Matamoros Maquiladora
Association, blamed Gonzalez and higher-than-average wages for the
city's failure to attract any major new company in 1989.
   Including benefits, an average Matamoros maquiladora worker
makes about $2.30 an hour, Lacambra said, compared to about $1.50
an hour in the Mexican states of Baja California Norte and
Chihuahua.
   Matamoros maquiladora workers also receive 56 hours' pay if they
show up for 40 hours in a week, Lacambra said, although workers at
maquiladoras in other border areas have to work 48 hours to get the
56 hours of pay.
   ``If the wages are too high, like they are in Matamoros, the
companies are going to go somewhere else,'' said Tito Torres, a
McAllen, Texas, attorney who for 18 years has represented such U.S.
companies as Zenith Electronics Corp. and American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co. in their business dealings in Mexico.
   Torres said clients have reported numerous incidents of union
harassment in Matamoros. Those included refusal to allow companies
to remove equipment for repairs, work stoppages staged apparently
when Gonzalez felt management slighted him, and an instance when
the union threatened a strike if a company did not withdraw theft
accusations against four employees and a plant manager.
   In another case, Torres said, the union tried to force a company
to buy union-owned equipment it did not need.
   But the business climate has improved recently, said Torres,
crediting President Salinas with bringing union caciques under
control.
   ``I'm hopeful that they are, because they're not the new
Mexico,'' Torres said. ``The last vestige of the old Mexico is in
the labor area.''
   Part of the union bosses' power lies in the labor federation's
position as a wing of the official Institutional Revolutionary
Party that maintains one-party rule at the national level. People
like Gonzalez are responsible for trucking in hundreds or thousands
of union members to party rallies.
   Gonzalez himself served two terms in the federal Chamber of
Deputies.
   But lately he hasn't been able to bring out the vote like
before, and the opposition Authentic Party of the Mexican
Revolution has won the Matamoros mayoral race twice in 10 years,
due partly to the growth of political opposition in Mexico.
   The labor leader said his role is to defend workers, not
politicians.
   ``I have people who work all the time and barely subsist,''
Gonzalez said.

<HEAD>Economic Indicators Rise in March</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: RECASTS lead to substitute `improved' for `robust' activity</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a sign of improved economic activity, the
government said Wednesday that its chief forecasting gauge surged
in March to the largest gain in more than a year.
   ``Basically, the message is the economy is showing signs the
worst is behind it,'' said Robert G. Dederick, chief economist with
the Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.
   The Commerce Department reported that its Index of Leading
Economic Indicators rose 0.9 percent in March, nearly offsetting
the 1 percent decline in February. It was the steepest increase
since a 1.6 percent gain in June 1988.
   The index is designed to forecast economic activity six to nine
months ahead.
   ``The (index) is hinting at a takeoff for the economy later this
year from an anemic growth pattern of the fourth quarter of 1989
and the first quarter of 1990,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist
with the Boston Co.
   But Dederick said the economy was ``not prepared to suddenly go
off on a spree.''
   Sinai said any progress could be dampened if the Federal Reserve
decided to boost interest rates further to curb rising inflation.
High rates would slow further what has been sluggishness in the
auto, construction and industrial sectors of the economy.
   In another report Wednesday, the Commerce Department pointed to
other signs of improvement in the industrial sector, saying that
orders to factories for manufactured goods rose 3.8 percent in
March.
   The March gain was the largest in more than a year and, together
with February's 1.8 percent advance, offset January's 5.5 percent
decline, the biggest fall since a 7 percent decrease in December
1974.
   ``The increase in the leading indicators was a big one,
widespread, solidly based,'' Sinai said. ``If more occurs in coming
months, it means the economy will do well later in the year.''
   Six of the 11 forward-looking statistics contributed to the
increase in the leading indicators, led by a gain in new plant and
equipment orders.
   Other contributors included an increase in the price of raw
materials, an increase in orders for consumer goods, higher stock
prices, slower business delivery times and a drop in weekly
unemployment claims.
   Negatives included a decrease in building permits, a decline in
the backlog of manufacturers' unfilled orders and a drop in the
money supply.
   Two of the components were unchanged: the average work week and
an index measuring consumer confidence.
   The various changes left the index at 145.2 percent of its 1982
base of 100. The index edged up 0.1 percent from October through
March on top of a 0.2 percent gain the previous six months.
   Lawrence A. Hunter, deputy chief economist with the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce, called the report ``an encouraging sign that the
economy will rebound from its dismal performance of the last two
quarters,'' but suggested it should be kept in perspective.
   ``Even though the increase was larger than any monthly rise we
have seen in more than a year and a half, the index remains just
about where it stood a year ago,'' he said.
   The index was 145.8 in April 1989.

<HEAD>Macy Says Losses Less In Recent Quarter Than Year-Earlier</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   R.H. Macy Inc. says its sales remained flat
during the most recent quarter, but the retailer was able to trim
its losses from a year earlier.
   In a letter to investors released Wednesday, Macy's executives
said the retail climate remained ``non-buoyant,'' as anticipated,
in the third quarter ended April 28.
   Without specifying how much the company lost during the quarter,
a Macy's spokeswoman said it was less than the $64 million lost on
sales of $1.5 billion in the year-ago period. Figures for the third
quarter are expected to be released in mid-June.
   The letter, signed by Macy's three top-ranking executives, said
the company cut its merchandise receipts by $250 million from
year-earlier levels, a move that helped reduce the company's
seasonal working capital needs.
   The retailer, which went private in a leveraged buyout in 1986,
is dependent on its cash flow to pay the remaining debt from the
buyout.
   Industry observers, while hesitant to comment about Macy's
financial health without specific figures, said lower inventory
levels were a step in the right direction.
   ``We are in a very conservative and frugal shopping climate, and
to enter the spring season with conservative stock levels is the
right thing to do,'' said Kurt Barnard, New York-based consultant
and publisher of the Retail Marketing Report.
   Lower inventory levels mean ``there is far less of a chance
they'll have to promote like hell to get rid of merchandise,''
Barnard said.
   But because Macy's is hard-pressed for cash to pay down debt
levels, ``it is not at all clear they will be able to escape the
promotional activity they are seeking to rid themselves of,''
Barnard said.
   Macy's, like all retailers, does not want to become dependent
upon price-cutting and other promotions to keep merchandise moving.
The company lost $39 million in the previous quarter because it was
forced to mark down merchandise to compete with price cutting at
department stores owned by Campeau Corp., which entered bankruptcy
court protection.
   The letter said Macy's expects its fourth quarter results to be
similar to the third quarter, although there should be volume
increases resulting from an expanded, store-wide pre-season sale in
July.
   Rumors have circulated in the industry that Macy's might be
forced to sell off some assets to cover its debt payments, but a
Macy's spokeswoman called the talk ``just rumors.''
   Besides its flagship Macy stores located mainly in the East and
Texas, the company owns I. Magnin and Bullock's stores in
California and the West. It also owns specialty stores including
Charter Club and Aeropostale, which are stocked with Macy's private
label apparel brands.

   The stock market pushed ahead today as traders
awaited details of the government's quarterly financing plans.
   Late today the Treasury was schedule to spell out plans for its
quarterly sale of bonds and notes next week, in which it is
expected to offer more than $30 billion worth of those securities.
   The size of the ``refunding'' and the reception it gets from
investors are widely seen as pivotal influences on the near-term
course of interest rates.
   Rates have been climbing lately, in part because of uneasiness
about the Treasury auctions.
   In the credit markets today, prices of long-term government
bonds declined slightly in early trading, but then recovered to
finish little changed.

   The dollar ended mostly higher Wednesday in
quiet trading following a mixed performance overseas. Gold prices
fell slightly after rising in Europe and Asia.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery settled at $369.50 a troy ounce, down 50 cents from late
Tuesday. Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for
gold at $369.70 an ounce, off 30 cents.
   Currency dealers said the markets had little reaction to the
latest set of government data, which pointed to continued strength
in the economy.
   The Commerce Department said its Index of Leading Economic
Indicators rose 0.9 percent in March, nearly offsetting a 1 percent
drop the previous month. It was the steepest rise since a 1.6
percent gain in June 1988.
   In another report, the department said factory orders rose 3.8
percent in March, rebounding from January's worst decline in 16
years.
   ``The numbers were within expectations,'' said Gabriele Schmitt,
a corporate trader for the Bank of New York. ``Most of the figures
were pretty much priced in.''
   She said traders also shrugged off news that East and West
Germany had agreed on key terms of their July 2 monetary union,
since that announcement contained few surprises.
   In Tokyo, where global trading begins, the dollar eased to
158.55 yen from 158.90 yen late Tuesday. The dollar traded at
158.25 yen in London, and at 158.015 yen in New York, down from
158.845.
   The dollar was mixed against the British pound from late
Tuesday. Sterling sold for $1.6435 in London, up from $1.6385, and
for $1.6425 in New York, down from $1.6445.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Tuesday's quotes, included: 1.6848 West German marks, up from
1.6805; 1.4550 Swiss francs, down from 1.4555; 5.6530 French
francs, up from 5.6370; 1,234.75 Italian lire, up from 1,231.75;
and 1.16715 Canadian dollars, up from 1.16455.
   Late European dollar rates compared with Tuesday: 1.6823 West
German marks, up from 1.6785; 1.4535 Swiss francs, down from
1.4545; 5.6425 French francs, up from 5.6365; 1.8910 Dutch
guilders, up from 1.8892; 1,232.25 Italian lire, up from 1,231.25;
and 1.1672 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1635.
   In London, gold closed at $369.25 an ounce, up from $368.50. The
closing Zurich bid was $368.85 and ounce, up from $367 late Monday.
Zurich markets were closed Tuesday for May Day.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $370.55 an ounce, up from
$369.45.
   Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery settled at $4.988 a troy ounce, down 2.5 cents
from Tuesday. Silver rose in London to $5.02 an ounce from $4.97.

<HEAD>Smith Pension Could Double Under Proposal Up for Vote</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The pension of departing General Motors Corp.
Chairman Roger B. Smith could double under a proposal that could
add $42 million to the automaker's costs for executive pensions in
its first year alone.
   The proposal, up for the vote of shareholders at GM's annual
meeting May 25, would base pensions for GM's top 3,350 executives
on an average of total cash compensation rather than just salary.
   The proposal comes during an aggressive cost-cutting campaign
adopted in 1987 aimed at cutting up to $13 billion from the
automaker's costs by the end of this year.
   The shareholders meeting in Detroit will be the last one chaired
by Smith, whose nine-year tenure has been criticized for focusing
too much on financial matters and too little on developing new cars
and trucks.
   United Auto Workers President Owen Bieber on Wednesday
criticized the pension change as unjustifiable.
   ``In view of GM's largess to its executives there will be no
excuse for the corporation to be less than fully responsive to the
needs of our older members and retirees,'' Bieber said. There are
about 400,000 retired UAW members.
   The UAW is to begin contract bargaining with GM in July. The
current pact expires Sept. 14.
   GM executives' pensions now are based on a formula keyed to
their average salaries in the past 10 years. Under the proposed
system, bonuses would be included in the formula.
   Last year, Smith's $1.1 million salary grew to $2.6 million with
bonuses, stock options and other compensation.
   Smith, who retires Aug. 1, stands to see his annual pension rise
to $1.1 million from about $550,000 under the new plan.
   Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. base their executives'
pensions on salary alone. Ford also has the option of giving the
executives added annuities.
   There is a growing movement in the UAW to add cost-of-living
allowances to hourly worker pension plans. Such a proposal, which
analysts have said would be extremely costly, was turned down at a
recent meeting of the UAW Skilled Trades Department.
   The issue is likely to attract a good deal of attention when the
UAW holds a three-day bargaining convention in Kansas City
beginning May 21.
   Executive salaries, bonuses and retirement packages have
prompted harsh criticism from the UAW in the past.
   ``It's outrageous, ridiculous,'' said Whitey Hale, a member of
UAW Local 326 in Flint who is a leader in the movement for
cost-of-living increases for retirees. ``How can they turn their
back on our members that actually made the money, to give
(themselves) the bonuses?''
   ``They'll get that every year, a million dollars, and our people
are getting $1,500 a month,'' he said.
   Smith will be succeeded by GM President Robert Stempel, who came
up through the company's engineering and marketing ranks. His move
into the chairmanship was praised by analysts who had criticized
Smith.
   When Smith became chairman on New Year's Day 1981, GM's share of
the U.S. car and truck market stood at 44.1 percent. At the end of
last year, its share was 34.6 percent.
   Also during Smith's tenure, the automaker took a back seat in
profits to smaller Ford Motor Co. Last year, GM regained the title
as the nation's most profitable automaker.

<HEAD>American General Puts Itself Up For Sale; Stock Jumps Higher</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH RENDON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American General Corp. surprised shareholders and
one suitor Wednesday by putting itself up for sale, in an auction
expected to fetch $7 billion for the nation's fourth largest
insurance company.
   The company's stock price jumped sharply higher after the
announcement at American General's annual shareholders meeting,
where the anticipated event had been a showdown with hostile suitor
Torchmark Corp.
   Harold S. Hook, American General's chairman, said the company
decided to put itself up for auction because it was vulnerable to a
possible takeover at a discount price and wanted to realize the
maximum value for its stockholders.
   American General finished up $7.50 at $47.62{ a share as the
most actively traded issue on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Company officials and analysts said they expected the bidding
for American General to reach about $7 billion, or more than $55
per share.
   Birmingham, Ala.-Torchmark had made an unsolicited $6.34
billion, or $50 per share, cash and stock buyout offer for American
General in March. But Torchmark later withdrew the offer, opting
instead to wage a proxy fight to elect its own five nominees to the
15-member board.
   Since then each company vigorously has been urging shareholders
to support its board nominees. Torchmark also asked shareholders to
approve two resolutions calling for American General to hire an
investment banking firm and to appoint a committee of independent
directors to evaluate acquisition proposals.
   ``We are confident we elected our slate of directors,'' Hook
said to the loud applause of the 650 shareholders attending the
meeting.
   ``I wish that was the end of the story,'' he added before
reading a statement announcing the sale.
   Torchmark Chairman Ron Richey said he was pleased with American
General's announcement.
   ``From the outset, our objective has been to negotiate a
transaction with American General, and we look forward to sitting
down with them to discuss a merger proposal,'' Richey said. ``Based
on today's announcement, regardless of the proxy vote, we intend to
make another proposal to combine Torchmark with American General.''
   The decision to sell the company was made about 6 p.m. Tuesday
in a meeting with the entire board, Hook said. He would not say if
the board's decision was unanimous.
   The sale announcement could not be made public until the
company's proxy vote had ended, he said.
   American General has subsidiaries that operate in 50 states and
Canada. The much-smaller Torchmark is best known for its Liberty
National Mutual Insurance subsidiary.
   American General has assets of $32 billion. Torchmark has assets
of $5 billion.
   Hook said the board would rather sell the company in one piece,
but would be prepared to sell off operating subsidiaries separately
if that wasn't possible.
   Asked if Torchmark's original offer was adequate, Hook said, a
$50 a share offer would be considered a discount price.
   He said he expects about 50 potential bidders initially. First
Boston Corp. will lead the company's selling effort.
   Analyst Hebert Goodfriend, with Prudential Bache Research in New
York, said he believed several companies would be interested in
American General, but would not name any.
   Torchmark's adamant interest in acquiring American General
``made a lot of other people aware that we were vulnerable,'' Hook
said. He said many companies have called wanting to discuss the
situation but reiterated that the company was not in search of a
``white knight'' to thwart the bid.
   The outcome of Wednesday's proxy vote will not be known for up
to two weeks, said American General spokesman John Pluhowski.

   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari sent a
proposal to Congress today to modify the constitution and
re-establish a private banking system in Mexico, the government
announced.
   Former President Jose Lopez Portillo nationalized the country's
35 private banks shortly before leaving office in 1982, claiming
that bankers had helped Mexicans take money out of the country,
worsening an economic recession.
   ``Once again there would be mixed banking, private banks and
public (owned) banks,'' said Leonardo Ffrench, a presidential
spokesman.
   The bill would allow 100 percent private ownership of commercial
banks.
   ``A change in social realities in the country, in economic
structures, of the state's role in the financial system, change the
circumstances that brought about the nationalization of banks,'' a
government statement said.
   ``We cannot allow a state as owner, with so many resources
invested in banking, in a country with so many urgent social
needs,'' it said. ``The government could take advantage of its
funds and free its resources to assist infrastructure and services
which are the essential role of the state.''
   A constitutional change must be approved by two-thirds of the
500-member Congress. That would require a coalition between the
governing Institional Revolutionary Party and opposition parties.
   Mexico's 1917 Constitution had decreed a mixed banking system.

<HEAD>Consumers May Feel Pinch as Insurers Cut Back on Personal
Insurance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW FRASER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A growing number of major insurers are
slashing or abandoning personal lines of insurance because of what
they call declining profits and increased meddling by state
regulators and lawmakers.
   Insurance industry analysts say this reduction could spell
serious trouble for consumers who need automobile, homeowners and
health policies. Some may be unable to find coverage.
   Xerox Corp.'s Crum and Forster insurance division announced last
month that it was exiting the personal insurance market altogether,
joining at least seven others who have reduced or eliminated their
personal insurance offerings.
   Those include Travelers Corp., Aetna Life and Casualty Co., and
The Hartford Insurance Group in the nation's insurance capital;
Philadelphia-based Cigna Corp.; The New Hampshire Insurance Group;
and Continental Corp. in New York.
   Insurance executives center much of their frustration on the
regulation of auto insurance. Many blame laws such as California's
Proposition 103, which would place restrictions on auto insurance
premiums, and New Jersey's new law effectively reducing auto
insurance premiums 20 percent, for the withdrawal from personal
insurance.
   ``You take any business in any industry and you tell them they
can't make any money, you don't have to be in insurance to know
what the business will do,'' said David Seifer, a researcher who
follows the insurance industry for Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, a
New York investment firm.
   ``It's price setting by the legislature,'' said Robert Brian, a
vice president of Hartford-based Conning and Co., a research firm.
``There's only one result and that's total economic chaos. The
arithmetic just doesn't add up. They're destroying the personal
insurance market.''
   California, New Jersey, Nevada, Pennsylvania and South Carolina
have all passed laws mandating some sort of a rate rollback. The
Massachusetts Legislature has been criticized for setting what
industry experts say are artificially low rates.
   On April 30, Aetna sued Massachusetts, claiming a provision of
the state law that penalizes insurers who want to stop selling auto
policies there is unconstitutional and amounts to extortion.
   There have been threats of rate rollbacks in Connecticut and at
least 15 other states, said Terry Tyrpin, assistance vice president
with the American Association of Independent Insurers, an
Illinois-based group.
   Joan Bianca, a Crum and Forster spokeswoman, said regulatory
restrictions were largely responsible in the company's decision.
Three-quarters of the company's business is done in states
undergoing insurance reforms.
   Hartford-based Travelers Corp. has withdrawn from the automobile
insurance field in California, affecting 18,000 customers. The
company also has stopped writing new policies in New Jersey and is
carefully choosing customers in other states.
   ``The business is extremely competitive, profits are very slim
so we are concentrating on areas we feel are more viable to us,'
said Dan Kaferle, a spokesman for Travelers. ``We don't see a
bright future in a business with regulations restricting price.''
   Kaferle said Travelers predicted it would have lost about $20
million between 1989 and 1991 in California, where rates have been
frozen at 1989 levels as lawmakers study proposed legislation. The
company also predicted losses in Pennsylvania, where auto insurance
reform is underway.
   Travelers has also stopped selling new individual major-medical
health insurance policies.
   Aetna is scaling down in states where profits are poor. The
company has dropped some independent agents and reduced
commissions. Aetna plans to reduce personal auto insurance business
by 20 percent over the next three years. The company also will stop
selling new individual health insurance policies in May.
   The company wrote $1.8 billion in premiums in 1989 and lost more
than $80 million, said spokesman John Hawkins.
   ``We've not thrown in the towel completely,'' said Hawkins.
``But we've made the decision that we are not going to grow the
business (in those states where we are unprofitable).''
   Insurance analysts say the trend was predictable, especially in
the deteriorating auto insurance field where some states have
regulated premiums to what the industry calls an unprofitable
level. More companies feeling the squeeze are expected to follow
suit.
   ``It's just the beginning,'' said Brian. ``They've just finally
run out of hope. The multi-line companies have decided that they
can't be everything to everybody.''
   Industry experts say the upheaval means many consumers will find
it tougher to buy individual health insurance or insurance for
their cars and homes, especially in states where regulation of
insurance rates is especially stiff or where legislation is pending.
   Moreover, as companies cut back and competition decreases, so
will the quality of insurance, said Larry Kibbee, a vice president
with the Alliance of American Insurers, an insurance industry
lobbying group.
   Analysts predict that many consumers will have to fall back on
substandard insurers. Getting claims processed may become a
consumer nightmare, they say.
   Others predict increased rates for some consumers, especially in
states with no restrictions, as insurers raise rates to offset
losses in other areas where rates are regulated.
   Industry executives assert that the state regulations attack the
symptom rather than the causes of high rates, which they blame on
problems ranging from fraudulent claims to the high cost of repairs
and litigation.
   ``Legislators are going to have to look more at some of the root
causes as to why the rates are as high as they are, especially in
the auto insurance industry,'' said Kibbee.
   Last year the Alliance did a survey and found, for example, that
it cost $60,000 for replacement parts for a 1989 Nissan Maxima with
a $17,000 sticker price, said Kibbee.
   The Washington-based American Insurance Association, an industry
lobbying group, has been pushing for better laws to keep insurance
claims out of court. Dave Snyder, an official of the organization,
said hefty attorney fees have pushed up insurance rates
tremendously.
   He suggested other solutions, like capping medical fees,
increasing automobile safety standards, and cracking down on
traffic violators to reduce accidents.
   ``Quick fix solutions like rate roll backs is not going to
help,'' said Terri Malenfant, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of
American Insurers. ``The only way is to hold down the costs of
repairs, medical costs and litigation costs.''
   Kaferle, of Travelers, said artificially low rates will hurt the
consumer in the long run.
   ``If you hold down those rates for no other reason other than to
hold down rates, eventually all those costs will have to catch up
with the consumers and they are going to have a major rate shock,''
he said.

   The Treasury Department announced Wednesday it
plans to borrow $30.5 billion from the public next week in a series
of debt auctions to replenish the government's coffers.
   ``We are offering $30.5 billion of notes and bonds to refund
$18.1 billion of privately-held notes and bonds maturing on May 15
and to raise approximately $12.4 billion of cash,'' Treasury
Undersecretary Robert Glauber told a news briefing.
   Glauber said the auctions next week would include:
   _ $10.5 billion in three-year notes in minimum denominations of
$5,000 to be auctioned on Tuesday;
   _ $10 billion in 10-year notes in minimum denominations of
$1,000 to be auctioned on Wednesday, and,
   _ $10 billion in 30-year bonds in minimum denominations of
$1,000 to be auctioned on Thursday.
   These notes and bonds are regularly sold during the large debt
auctions held four times a year.

   Undaunted by a 2-month-old strike, Greyhound Lines
Inc. on Wednesday unveiled a summer radio advertising campaign
touting bus travel as ``a window seat on America.''
   Greyhound also announced a reduced fare program for some
Northeast and Midwest markets where recovery has been lagging.
   The Dallas-based company, which operates the only nationwide bus
system, was struck by 6,500 drivers and some 3,000 clerical and
maintenance employees March 2. The company and union said Wednesday
they would resume negotiations Saturday in Washington.
   Greyhound spokeswoman Liz Hale said that although the company
has been operating reduced schedules during the strike, recent
expansions have restored service to about 86.9 percent of
pre-strike locations. Further expansions are planned as the busy
summer traveling season approaches.
   The ad campaign ignores the strike, instead stressing service.
   ``We're offering so much service now,'' Ms. Hale said. ``The
strike has not hampered our ability to bring back service to most
markets that we were serving before the strike started, so most of
our passengers are finding that they can go to their destinations.''
   About 3.5 million passengers have ridden Greyhound since the
strike began. In recent days, loads have been running between 53
percent and 58 percent of the same day last year, the company said.
   Union officials have disputed Greyhound's figures on restored
service, putting it at about 20 percent of pre-strike levels.
   The union claims Greyhound faces a mounting cash crunch. The
company, created through a 1987 leveraged buyout, has a $9 million
interest payment due May 15. Greyhound has said it will be able to
make the payment.
   Ms. Hale, citing company policy, would not disclose the cost of
the ad campaign.
   Greyhound's past owners have used television campaigns, but Ms.
Hale said the current owners have used radio exclusively because
``it fits our demographics.'' Greyhound says its passengers tend to
be students or from low-income families.
   The campaign, which debuts Monday and is to run through August,
features three versions of a jingle. The ads will run on nationwide
networks serving more than 3,000 stations and in 11 large
metropolitan areas.
   The jingle, in gospel, rock and blues versions, urges travelers
to ``take a window seat on America, take a Greyhound cruise, don't
need a lot of money to be traveling in style.''
   The reduced fare promotion puts a $99 cap on one-way fares with
no advance purchase requirements. The fare is good Friday through
June 13 and includes Chicago plus Connecticut, Maine,
Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont.
   Greyhound also lowered round trip fares in a dozen New England
markets.
   The promotion is the second to target the Northeast since the
strike. During the Easter travel period, Greyhound offered free
tickets in some markets if buses did not run on time.

   Hopes for a respite from the recent rise of
interest rates helped the stock market stage a moderate advance
Wednesday.
   Analysts said some traders apparently were buying on
expectations that a forthcoming financing by the government might
draw a better response than has been feared.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 20.72 to 2,689.64,
stretching its gain since the start of the week to 44.59 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
864 up, 612 down and 478 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 141.61 million
shares, against 149.02 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 171.08 million shares.
   After the market closed the Treasury spelled out plans for its
quarterly sale of bonds and notes next week, saying it would
auction a record $30.50 billion in new securities.
   The size of the ``refunding'' and the reception it gets from
investors are widely seen as pivotal influences on the near-term
course of interest rates.
   Rates have been climbing lately, in part because of uneasiness
about the Treasury auctions.
   In the credit markets Wednesday, prices of long-term government
bonds declined slightly in early trading, but then recovered to
finish little changed.
   American General was the day's most active issue, up 7{ at 47|
on turnover of more than 7.1 million shares. The company, after
asserting that it had won a proxy battle against Torchmark,
announced plans to seek other prospective buyers.
   Xerox fell 1\ to 46}. The company denied rumors that it was
considering a cut in its dividend on the heels of its recent report
of lower-than-expected quarterly earnings from continuing
operations.
   Halliburton, which posted higher earnings for the first quarter,
gained ~ to 44&lsqb;.
   Chrysler rose { to 15} in active trading on top of a }-point
gain Tuesday, when the company reported an 80 percent decline in
first-quarter earnings. Some analysts had expected the profit
showing to be worse than it turned out.
   Other gainers among the blue chips included Exxon, up } at 45~;
International Business Machines, up 1&lsqb; at 109&lsqb;; General Motors, up
{ at 44}, and Boeing, up } at 73.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $19.45 billion, or
0.61 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
climbed 1.12 to 183.34.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 2.73 to 389.81, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 2.23 at 334.48.

<HEAD>Energy Futures Fall as OPEC Meeting Hits Snag</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices fell Wednesday as OPEC's
latest attempt to curb overproduction stalled.
   The market moved higher in early trading on anticipation that an
agreement to limit output might be reached. But when traders heard
reports that ministers meeting in Geneva could not agree on how to
allocate production cuts, prices fell back.
   The June contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
U.S. crude oil, slipped 13 cents to close at $18.68 a 42-gallon
barrel after trading as high as $19.10 early in the session.
   Home heating oil for June delivery fell 1.11 cents to 51.86
cents a gallon, and June unleaded regular gasoline dropped 0.08
cent to 60.95 cents a gallon.
   Natural gas for June delivery rose to $1.575 per million British
thermal units, from $1.565 Tuesday.
   One delegate source at the Geneva meeting said the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries ministers were far apart in their
positions and no one idea emerged from the talks.
   Ministers held a full plenary session for about half an hour
early Wednesday afternoon and then broke up to negotiate in small
groups in their hotel rooms.
   But plans to resume the full session were postponed twice and
then delayed ``until further notice to allow for further
consultations'' among the ministers, OPEC said.
   Andrew Lebow, an analyst with E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures
Inc., said news of the postponement dashed the oil market's hopes
for a quick agreement.
   Traders have been anxious for new production limits to support
prices, which have fallen 20 percent since January. But analysts
have doubted OPEC could achieve enough of a production cutback to
have a significant impact on prices.
   OPEC is producing an estimated 23 million to 24 million barrels
a day, well above its self-imposed ceiling of 22.1 million barrels
a day. The excess output came ahead of a seasonal drop in demand,
causing a glut on world markets.

   Soybean futures prices resumed their 3-month-old rally Wednesday
as traders ignored bearish supply factors and again took their cues
from price movement charts that suggested the market had room to
move higher.
   Grain futures also rose sharply on the Chicago Board of Trade
while on other markets, oil, copper and precious metal futures fell
and most livestock and meat futures advanced.
   Soybean futures settled 6{ cents to 9\ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in May up 9 cents at $6.36{ a bushel.
   Wheat futures settled 4 cents to 6 cents higher with May at
$3.73{ a bushel; corn was 2{ cents to 4\ cents higher with May at
$2.87} a bushel; oats were 3} cents to 6 cents higher with May at
$1.68{ a bushel.
   The price of soybeans for near-term delivery has risen about 15
percent since Jan. 9, when the market began its climb from $5.53{ a
bushel.
   The buying has been spurred at times by fundamental factors such
as Brazilian soybean harvesting delays and strong domestic demand
for soybean meal.
   But observers said the powerful advance of the past week,
totaling about 27 cents in the last six trading sessions _ has been
led by speculators that trade according to their interpretation of
price charts, known as technical analysis.
   Based on the charts, analysts said, the market looked ripe for a
rally Wednesday after Tuesday's modest decline. Funds operated by
the big trading companies Tudor Investment Corp. and Refco Inc.
were said to be big buyers despite forecasts for beneficial rain in
the Midwestern corn and soybean belt and indications that the
Brazilian soybean harvest is advancing rapidly.
   ``It was a purely chart-driven market,'' said William
Biedermann, director of research for Allendale Inc., a Chicago-area
trading firm.
   ``If you want to come up with a fundamental reason, you'd have
to dream something up like anticipation of adverse weather and
stronger export demand, but that's really fishing for something,''
he said.
   The wheat market was supported by some fundamental news. The
Agriculture Department announced Wednesday morning that it had
targeted China for sales of 2 million metric tons of U.S. wheat at
subsidized prices.
   Wheat futures also were boosted by concerns that heavy rains in
Texas and Oklahoma could cause winter wheat harvest delays and crop
losses, analysts said.
   Oil futures dipped on the New York Mercantile Exchange, erasing
early gains, after OPEC ministers meeting in Geneva postponed a
second full plenary session about ways to cut their oil production
and raise crude oil prices.
   The ministers, meeting in emergency session, were finding it
difficult to agree on how much to trim production and how to
allocate the cuts among cartel members, sources told The Associated
Press.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 11 cents to 21 cents
lower with June at $18.68 a barrel; heating oil was .89 cent to
1.12 cents lower with June at 51.85 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was unchanged to .15 cent lower with June at 60.95 cents a
gallon.
   Copper futures ended lower on New York's Commodity Exchange
following reports that the Peruvian government had ordered back to
work employees of the Southern Peru Copper Corp. who have been on
strike since March 12.
   Copper settled .60 cent to 1.5 cents lower with May at $1.213 a
pound.
   Also on the Commodity Exchange, gold futures settled 70 cents to
80 cents lower with June at $372 a troy ounce; silver was 2.5 cents
to 3 cents lower with May $4.988 a troy ounce.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live cattle finished .15
cent to .38 cent higher with June at 73.60 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .10 cent to .35 cent higher with May at 82.72 cents a
pound; live hogs were unchanged to .43 cent higher with June at
63.87 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .30 cent lower to
1.12 cents higher with May at 69.77 cents a pound.

<HEAD>President Asks Congress to Allow Return to Private Banking</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRIS ANGELO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari on
Wednesday proposed a constitutional amendment to reopen banking to
private ownership, but said the government would retain some
nationalized commercial banks.
   The president said his proposal to Congress for the amendment
reflected the economic changes since President Jose Lopez Portillo
nationalized the nation's 35 private banks in 1982 at the outset of
Mexico's financial crisis.
   Lopez Portillo claimed the banks were helping Mexicans get money
out of the country, worsening an economic recession.
   ``Circumstances have changed,'' Salinas said in a communique.
``The development policies have been modified and transcendental
transformations have been carried out in the economic structures.
   ``The country has made an enormous effort to overcome the crisis
and, at the same time, to respond to the challenges of the last
decade of the 20th Century: to respond with justice to the demands
of society and confront with sovereignty a transformed, more
competitive, technologically revolutionized world of still
uncertain perspectives.''
   Since Lopez Portillo nationalized the banks, the banking system
has been reopened to 34 percent ownership by private investors,
independent government agencies or corporations. A presidential
spokeswoman said that under the Salinas proposal 100 percent
private ownership would be possible.
   Salinas' bill faces a tougher time in Congress than the
constitutional amendment that allowed the nationalization.
   In 1982, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, held a
two-thirds majority in Congress and rubber-stamped presidential
bills. It lost that advantage in 1988, when Salinas won by the
slimmest presidential margin in the party's 60-year history.
   Leftist parties, which oppose Salinas' program to privatize
state-owned industry and business, quickly criticized the bill.
   Ricardo Pascoe Pierce of the Democratic Revolutionary Party, the
largest leftist party, said the proposal was a ploy to try to win
popularity in national and foreign financial circles.
   With 123 of the 500 seats in the lower house, they could not
defeat the bill, but are likely to try to slow it down and arouse
nationalistic sentiment.
   Support for the bill is likely from the pro-business National
Action Party. The PRI reached a deal with the party in 1989 to pass
electoral reforms.
   Salinas has sold or put up for sale major companies including
the national airline, steel mills and its stock in the telephone
monopoly. But he had not yet ventured into sectors set aside for
the government in the Constitution, including banking, oil and
electricity.
   He skirted the Constitution in the petrochemical area,
reclassifying some basic petrochemicals to secondary, thus allowing
private and foreign investment.
   Salinas said many of Mexico's social needs can be met with money
the government no longer will spend on banking and with money
raised by the sale of bank stock.
   Under the bill, ``the state proposes that it not be the majority
owner of each and every one of the banking institutions,'' he said.
``However, it will retain a participation in commercial banking and
will strengthen those institutions oriented to development of
specific priority activities.''
   A presidential statement noted that France and Portugal, among
other countries, had made similar banking reforms and that eastern
European countries were preparing similar changes.
   Salinas did not mention foreign banks and it was not immediately
clear how, or if, they would be affected.
   One foreign banker, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the proposal was ``very fuzzy'' and did not ensure that existing
banks would be sold.
   Eduardo Garcia Suarez, president of the National Association of
Chambers of Commerce, said the country needs an exclusively
private, rather than mixed, system to be able to compete
internationally, the government news agency Notimex said.

<TEXT>
   Control Data Corp.'s new chief executive told
shareholders Wednesday he has purged the computer company of
bureaucracy, wasteful spending and arbitrary bonuses.
   At an annual meeting punctuated by shareholder criticism of
multimillion-dollar severance and retirement packages, Lawrence
Perlman said changes in the company's ``culture'' should lead to
``consistent profitability.''
   ``The Control Data of the past was not always a company that
thought in terms of building shareholder value,'' said Perlman, who
became chief executive in January after the company posted a net
loss of $680 million in 1989.
   He said stockholders, employees and customers have been asked to
``endure a great deal'' during the last five years, in which the
company lost $1.5 billion.
   But Perlman defended the company's board for signing a contract
in 1986 that gave former company head Robert Price $5.31 million in
severance, retirement and bonus money. Price also will get $450,000
a year under a three-year consulting contract and receive a
$300,000 annual pension.
   Two shareholders took the floor at the meeting to criticize
Price's contract and previous large payouts to retiring senior
executives.
   ``I'm outraged,'' said Edward Diesing, a former Control Data
employee who termed the compensation ``exorbitant payoffs'' and
``payola.''
   ``It's called greed,'' said Diesing, who was applauded by fellow
shareholders. ``There is way too much of this attitude in the U.S.
and quite possibly at Control Data. What do you think happens to
employees' morale when these disturbing sins are reported?''
   Perlman said Price's contract was ``reasonable'' at the time it
was signed four years ago. But senior executives signing such
agreements today are entitled to less, he said.
   For instance, senior executives no longer are entitled to
severance payments if they leave voluntarily, Perlman said.
   Price announced last month that he would not stand for
re-election to the company's board of directors. The company lost
$924 million during his four-year reign.
   Perlman said all consulting contracts at the company are under
review because some have been ``abused,'' and he said no employees
will receive bonus money unless they achieve profits for the
company.
   In some cases under the old bonus system, payments were ``quite
subjective,'' he said. ``I want people to be able to produce a
number,'' Perlman said.
   In his remarks to shareholders, Perlman made repeated references
to Control Data's past. Once self-described as the world's most
innovative company, Control Data grew wildly and profited in the
1960s and '70s before stumbling in the '80s.
   ``Buoyed by the large gross margins of the 1970s and the early
1980s, the company did not build into its culture the discipline of
constant attention to controlling expenses and reducing costs,''
Perlman said.
   He said corporate overhead was ``out of hand several years
ago,'' but has been controlled by a reduction in corporate staff to
250 from about 3,000 in 1985.
   ``People are beginning to treat the company's money as if it
were their own,'' he said.
   He also said investment decisions will be ``based on financial
analysis and reasonable expectations of returns on investment _ not
on hope, not on emotion.''
   Perlman and Price last year shut down Control Data's
supercomputer subsidiary, ETA Systems, at a cost about $335 million.
   Control Data founder William C. Norris, who headed the company
until 1986 and still sits on the board of directors, said he wasn't
offended by Perlman's portrayal of the company's past.
   ``I didn't take it personally,'' Norris said after the meeting.
``The company had problems from time to time. The thing that hurt
us more than anything else was the Japanese.''
   Analysts have predicted Control Data's net income for 1990 at $1
a share to $1.50 a share. Perlman said he is not comfortable with
the prediction beyond ``the midpoint of that range.''

   Former Ashland Oil Co. Chairman Orin Atkins
testified Wednesday that he never personally benfited from a scheme
to sell confidential Ashland documents to Iran's national oil
company.
   Atkins took the stand in the U.S. District Court trial of
attorney Charles Barnett, 38, of Palm Beach, Fla., who is charged
connection with the 1979 conspiracy. Atkins pleaded guilty to
related charges last September and agreed to cooperate.
   ``I never received any money from any Iranian at any time,''
Atkins said.
   In opening arguments Monday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Herve
Gouraiage described Barnett as an instrumental player in the
conspiracy to sell the documents to the Iranian National Oil
Company for use in a civil lawsuit against Ashland.
   ``Barnett was the person who thoroughly familiarized himself
with the contents of the stolen Ashland documents so he could
explain their usefulness to the Iranians,'' Gouraiage said.
   The papers dealt with the 1979 sale of $283 million of crude oil
from the Iranian company to a subsidiary of the Kentucky oil
concern, Ashland Overseas Trading Ltd.
   Iran sued Ashland in 1985 for not paying for the oil, and
Ashland settled the case last year by agreeing to pay $325 million.
   Prosecutors said Atkins initiated the plan in 1982 after being
forced to resign his executive position in 1981. He continued to
work for Ashland as a highly paid consultant until 1984.
   Atkins, in his guilty plea, admitted that he improperly obtained
259 corporate documents and tried to sell them to the Iranians in
return for a cut of any damages Iran won in the lawsuit.
   On the witness stand, Atkins said he and others involved in the
deal also tried to sell his consulting services, which would have
involved identifying Ashland employees who were potential witnesses
in the lawsuit.
   He said he met only once, in 1982, with ``unofficial
representatives'' of the Iranian company. Atkins said negotiations
with the Iranians were handled by former Ashland consultant Roy
Furmark, Barnett and others.
   Furmark, who also will testify, pleaded guilty in the scheme in
March. He admitted showing some of the documents to representatives
of the Iranian company at a meeting in London.
   Atkins faces up to 10 years in prison and a $500,000 fine when
sentenced later this year for conspiracy and wire fraud.
   The first witness at Barnett's trial was Dustan McCoy, an
Ashland attorney, who said the company had refused to pay Iran for
the oil because it believed Iran had breached the contract.
   Barnett's attorney, Marvin Segal, told the jury in opening
remarks that Barnett's actions were part of a ``legal enterprise to
help the Iranian oil company collect the money it avowedly was
owned.''
   The indictment against Barnett said he, Atkins and others made
numerous attempts to sell the documents to the Iranians between
1982 and 1988. Prosecutors have not said whether the Iranians
bought any documents.
   Furmark was a marginal participant in the Iran-Contra scandal
and gave testimony during investigations by House and Senate
committees and special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh.
   Barnett's attorneys are seeking to obtain transcripts of
Furmark's testimony about the Iran-Contra affair to use in
Barnett's defense.
   U.S. District Judge John E. Sprizzo has said he will review the
testimony before ruling on its admissibility as evidence.

<HEAD>Ford President Acknowledges Regulation Has Brought Improvement</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on general news wires</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co.'s new president acknowledged
Wednesday that improvements in the auto industry have followed
government regulations which were not always received gracefully by
the industry.
   Philip E. Benton, who became Ford president and chief operating
officer March 1, also said he expects the world auto industry in 10
years to include only about a half dozen dominant companies, down
from about a dozen today.
   ``Critics of the U.S. auto industry viewed us as fighting just
about every regulatory initiative that Washington and the state
capitals could come up with'' in the 1960s and 1970s, Benton said
in a speech. ``We clearly gained a reputation for intransigence.''
   He said the industry often sought only to alter timetables or
the stringency of particular standards, and did not oppose the
principles behind government initiatives.
   Automakers now have gone through a tough transition from
focusing on consumers and competition to ``worrying about
regulatory complexity and compliance,'' he said, ``And, in some
instances, we didn't make it very gracefully.''
   But Benton said Ford is pleased with its progress in installing
airbags, manufacturing full-sized cars that get as much as 25 miles
per gallon, reducing auto exhaust emissions and beginning to phase
out chlorofluorocarbons _ all the result of government regulation.
   ``We've invested heavily and aggressively in the technology and
human resources that have allowed us to come this far toward
resolving environmental and safety concerns, and we're prepared to
do our part in the future in cooperation with government,'' Benton
said.
   He said changes are creating a new world which will no longer be
defined by military strength but by the ``economic strengths and
interrelationships'' of North America, Europe and Asia.
   Benton said he did not believe in ``Japan bashing'' or in ``the
habit of some to bash the home team.''
   But he said the U.S. auto industry has been shaken up by the
entry of Japanese companies.
   ``As a result, the stability of the North American market (once
dominated by Ford, Chrysler Corp. and General Motors Corp.,) for
the time being, is gone, and North America is up for grabs,'' he
said.
   Worldwide consolidation will likely occur with more
partnerships, purchases and absorptions, he said. He noted that
Chrysler bought American Motors in 1987, General Motors bought
about half of Saab's car business last year and this year Ford
bought Jaguar while Renault and Volvo announced a far-reaching
alliance.
   Ford will be one of the surviving strong half-dozen companies,
Benton said, declining to predict who the others might be.

<HEAD>Southern Co.: Earnings Down Due to Mild Winter, PSC Decision</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Southern Co. said higher production costs, a mild
winter and an unfavorable Georgia rate decision combined to depress
the utility's first quarter earnings by more than 40 percent.
   The company Wednesday reported earnings of $113 million for the
first three months of 1990 or 36 cents a share, down from $197
million or 62 cents a share in the same period of 1989.
   President Edward L. Addison said a decision last fall by the
Georgia Public Service Commission was a key factor in the earnings
slippage. The commission awarded $218 million of the $413 million
sought by Southern's Georgia Power Co. subsidiary to recover
construction costs from Unit 2 of nuclear Plant Vogtle.
   Addison said Southern's total electricity sales were down 1.2
percent as a result of a warm winter.
   Southern Co., based in Atlanta, is the parent firm of five
electric companies in the Southeast: Alabama Power, Georgia Power,
Gulf Power, Mississippi Power and Savannah Electric.

and either June 11 or July 9 for certain Chevrolet vehicles, the
company said Wednesday.
   The program, which extends incentives on some models, is

<HEAD>Contractors Angry At Taj Mahal For Delayed Payments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Contractors have asked the Casino
Control Commission to help force the Taj Mahal Casino Resort to
complete payment for work on Donald Trump's new casino, a
commission spokesman said.
   The commission has yet to receive a formal complaint to refer to
the state Division of Gaming Enforcement, however, said the
spokesman, Tom Flynn.
   Taj Mahal spokeswoman Karen Tuso said she could not comment on
the complaints and referred all questions to Ed Tracy, who
supervises Trump's three Atlantic City gaming halls and other
properties in the city. Tracy did not return telephone calls
immediately.
   The Philadelphia Inquirer reported Wednesday that about $35
million is owed to about 100 contractors for work on the casino,
which cost $1 billion.
   The contractors said they had pushed to meet the casino's April
2 opening and felt they should be paid in full now.
   Tracy told the newspaper that Trump ``made a simple business
decision'' to hold back 10 percent of contract amounts until an
audit determined if the contractors had submitted inflated invoices.
   ``Granted, it's slighlty after the fact,'' Tracy said. `It would
be negligent not to do an audit given the size of the project.''

<HEAD>Farah Files Suit Against Farah Inc.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   William F. Farah, who managed apparel
manufacturer Farah Inc. for 43 years, accused the company of
ignoring his experience and expertise in a lawsuit to get back his
job as board chairman.
   Farah was replaced as chairman of the Farah Inc. board last
week. He is seeking a temporary restraining order against the
company in county court. He wants the court to stop the board of
directors from ousting him from his plant office and barring him
from company facilities.
   In the suit, Farah calls the board members ``spiteful
conspirators'' who want to destroy him financially. The suit says
the board members have threatened to terminate Farah's consulting
services.
   Farah is the company's largest stockholder.
   According to the suit, the disagreement between Farah and the
board stems from a three-year consulting agreement that went into
effect July 1. The contract is part of a long-term employment
agreement that Farah and the company entered into after Farah
resigned as president and chief executive officer last July 6.
   Farah alleges that the board ignored his suggestions and ideas
to the detriment of the company and its shareholders. He said the
company has suffered substantial financial losses as a result.
   Richard Allender, company president, was out of town and did not
return phone calls.

   Mayor Tom Bradley on Wednesday proposed
mandatory conservation measures requiring all water customers to
cut use by 10 percent from 1986 levels to cope with California's
worsening drought.
   The state is experiencing its fourth consecutive drought year
and ``the situation is serious,'' Bradley said at a news conference
at City Hall.
   The regional Metropolitan Water District, which provides about
half the water needed by 15 million people in Southern California,
has forecast a 10 percent shortfall in its supplies this summer.
   The city's Department of Water and Power, which is getting 60
percent of its water supply from the Metropolitan Water District
this year, serves 3.4 million residents.
   The mayor's request was ``a judgment call,'' said James F.
Wickser, the department's water chief. Available water supplies for
the city appear adequate at least through December, and consumption
last month was 14 percent below April 1989, Wickser said.
   Bradley said there is a need to step up a voluntary water
conservation program in effect since 1988.
   Although the measures Bradley proposed are the most restrictive
since the state's record drought of 1977, they pale in comparison
to those in Santa Barbara, where officials are trying to cut water
use by 45 percent.
   In a letter to the City Council, Bradley sought changes in a
1977 drought ordinance that set out five increasingly stringent
steps for conservation.
   Council approval likely will take six weeks at least, mayoral
aides said.
   ``We can no longer delay in informing the citizens of Los
Angeles that because of the lengthy statewide drought we have no
choice but to require water-reducing actions by every resident,
business and corporation,'' Bradley said in a statement.
   Council President John Ferraro agreed that the measures are
needed and said the proposal has already been scheduled for the
appropriate council committee.
   The two-year-old city drought ordinance's first phase calls for
a voluntary 10 percent cutback. It forbids people from hosing down
sidewalks and driveways, and restaurants and hotels from routinely
serving drinking water. It has not been widely observed or
enforced, although the Department of Water and Power reported total
water use last summer fell about 8 percent.
   Commonplace first phase violations prompted the mayor to seek
the mandatory 10 percent reduction, aides said.
   The mayor also recommended a ban on watering gardens and lawns
between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. and prohibiting water from overflowing
onto sidewalks or streets.
   Bradley's proosal would assess surcharge penalties for excess
water use.
   The bimonthly bill for an average residential customer who fails
to cut water use by 10 percent would jump from about $50 to about
$70 on the first offense, said John Stodder, a mayoral aide.
   Additional penalties would be heaped on customers who continue
to use too much water, including the installation of water flow
restriction devices or a service shut-off for repeat offenders.
   Under existing law, a City Council resolution is needed to
implement the penalty aspects of the conservation ordinance.
   The mayor said that those who voluntarily have cut back 10
percent of their 1986 water use, when water was plentiful, would
not be required to make additional reductions.

<HEAD>Stock Prices Continue to Rebound Strongly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stock prices on the Seoul Stock
Exchange continued to rebound strongly Thursday morning with the
compostite index rising 31.94 points or 4.4 percent to 750.39
points.
   It was the year's biggest single-day gain and followed Tuesday's
29.79 points rise, which brought the index up from an 18-month low
of 688.82 on Monday. The market was closed Wednesday, a national
holiday.
   The two-day rally was prompted by the government's announcement
of market boosting measures aimed at saving the market from
imminent collapse.
   In a midnight meeting of economic ministers Monday ordered by
President Roh Tae-woo, the government decided to force business
conglomerates, security and insurance firms to sell their land held
for speculative purpose and use proceeds to buy stocks.
   Newspapers reported Thursday that the government has ordered the
top five business conglomerates to sell their land holdings within
six months and invest proceeds in stocks. It warned that otherwise
they face punitive actions such as a cutoff in fresh bank loans and
severe taxes.
   It has been reported that many business companies have been
engaged in rampant real estate speculation at the sacrifice of
investment in production facilities in anticipation of high
inflation.
   They also have shunned investment in existing and new business
projects concerned about waves of protracted labor strikes
demanding steep wage hikes and more union rights.
   The country's economy has been sagging since early last year
because of a slowdown in exports and rapid price increases.
