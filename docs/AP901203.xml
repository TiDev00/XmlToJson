   A former state representative got a
6{-year prison term and an ex-state senator was given six months at
a halfway house Monday, the first sentences handed out after a
federal probe of bribery at the Statehouse.
   The probe has led to bribery charges against nine lawmakers and
drug charges against a 10th lawmaker and a lobbyist.
   Former state Rep. Luther Taylor ``brought great shame on elected
officials and the citizens of this state, such that it would cause
all of us to hang our heads in shame for letting it come into
being,'' U.S. District Judge Falcon Hawkins said at a sentencing
hearing.
   Hawkins gave Taylor the maximum prison term allowed under
federal sentencing guidelines. Earlier Monday, he sentenced former
state Sen. Rick Lee, who also was charged with selling his vote.
   Taylor, 41, a Democrat, was convicted in October of six counts
of violating the Hobbs Act, a federal anti-bribery law.
   He was charged with conspiring to solicit bribes and with
accepting a total of $4,300 from a lobbyist-turned-FBI informant in
exchange for supporting a bill allowing betting on horse and dog
racing in South Carolina.
   Taylor was taken into custody after Hawkins rejected a defense
motion to let Taylor remain free on bond pending his appeal.
   Joel Collins, Taylor's attorney, said after the hearing that
Taylor knew he might be sentenced to prison. ``I think he accepted
the news as well as anyone can.''
   Lee, 37, a Republican, avoided a prison time because of his
cooperation with prosecutors in the investigation of statehouse
corruption. In addition to his six-month term in a halfway house,
Lee received five years' probation and will have to pay $3,000 in
restitution.
   Federal sentencing guidelines would have allowed Hawkins to
sentence Lee to up to 27 months in prison.
   Lee and three other former legislators pleaded guilty in August
to accepting a $2,000 bribe from a lobbyist for his work on behalf
of the pari-mutuel betting bill. The four all had resigned from the
legislature when they were indicted in August.
   ``I'm very appreciative of the judge's sentencing and the work
my attorney did,'' Lee said afterward. ``I'm very thankful at being
sentenced to a halfway house where I can work and contribute to my
family's well-being. That in itself is a blessing.''
   A fifth ex-legislator pleaded guilty to a cocaine charge and
also awaits sentencing.
   Four other House members await trials later this month and next.
Lobbyist James Brown V, indicted on a marijuana charge, died last
week of complications from lung disease.

   The Magellan spacecraft found evidence that
volcanoes may be erupting to this day on Venus and that they gushed
an Australia-sized flood of lava in recent geological times.
   The spacecraft's new radar pictures of the cloud-covered planet
suggest that ``at any given time, Venus is active in several
regions,'' said Roger Phillips, a scientist at Southern Methodist
University in Dallas. ``Venus is not dead.''
   Magellan's pictures show there are no meteorite impact craters
in an Australia-sized portion of the planet, Phillips said Monday
during a meeting of the American Geophysical Union.
   That means the huge area is covered by lava that was deposited
sometime within the last tens of millions of years - relatively
recent in geological terms, Phillips said.
   ``It raises the likelihood Venus is still active,'' he added.
   Magellan hasn't yet found direct proof that volcanoes are
erupting today on the planet. To accomplish that, Magellan must fly
over the same parts of Venus twice and look for differences caused
by any active lava flows.
   And that won't happen until next spring.
   Magellan was launched from a shuttle in May 1989, went into
orbit around Venus on Aug. 10 and started maing maps and pictures
in September.
   As of Monday, Magellan had orbited Venus 847 times. It bounces
radar off the planet's surface to make images.

<HEAD>Maine Town Uses Shopping Outlets To Weather Recession</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Tuesday AMs report.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>FREEPORT, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Once a shoe-factory town with vacant
storefronts, this village has become a veritable shopping nirvana.
   Though it has only 7,500 residents, Freeport boasts 110 outlet
stores - 65 in a seven-block area of downtown alone - including
such well-known names as L.L. Bean, Dansk and J. Crew.
   Freeport's unusual range of stores has enabled it to weather the
recession better than most other towns in Maine and other New
England states, business and government officials say.
   ``It's the Disney World of shopping right here,'' said J'clyn
McLennan, manager of the Mikasa outlet store. ``I haven't felt the
hurt of the economy. I've heard a lot about it, but I haven't felt
it or seen it.''
   But the retailing success has come at a price.
   Some longtime residents complain the town is so clogged with
traffic it can take a half-hour to drive from one end to the other.
And they say the outlet stores cater to tourists and don't carry
the products - such as groceries - needed for daily living.
   ``I think it stinks,'' said Betty Wentworth, 69, who has lived
in Freeport since 1952. ``They've got a lot of stores, but retired
people or people of an average income can't afford to shop there.''
   As Mrs. Wentworth talked in her kitchen on a recent fall day,
Kathleen Brodie of Northboro, Mass., hunted for bargains a
half-mile away in downtown Freeport.
   ``I'm on my way home from Canada,'' she said. ``I made an effort
to leave Canada early so I'd have time to come by here.''
   Brodie, who treks to Freeport about four times a year, said many
of the town's outlets sell merchandise at prices at least 25
percent lower than similar stores in Boston.
   A block away, Meg and Kate Schwartz, sisters from Brielle, N.J.,
marveled at Freeport's array of stores. ``The stores don't look
like outlet warehouses - they look like regular stores,'' said Meg,
21. ``It's a nice atmosphere and a pretty town.''
   The town has capitalized on two retailing trends: the popularity
of outlet shopping and the American pastime of shopping as
recreation, said Beth Gleason, executive director of the Freeport
Merchants Association.
   ``The American people are becoming savvier consumers looking for
the best bargain,'' Gleason said. ``The other thing is that
shopping has become a family event that replaces other forms of
recreation.
   ``That's why Freeport has been such a success,'' she said. ``We
also have L.L. Bean, which is unique in the world.''
   The company's namesake, L.L. Bean, began selling hunting shoes
by mail in 1912. He later added other clothing for hunting, such as
wool shirts and socks.
   ``As people started receiving the catalog, they decided they
wanted to stop in here in Freeport,'' said company spokesman Kilton
Andrew. ``There wasn't any store there. People would just meet them
at the door and take them to the areas where they stocked the
merchandise and sell them what they wanted.
   ``Then people started showing up in the middle of the night and
they literally rousted L.L. out of bed,'' he said.
   So in the 1930s, Bean set aside space for a retail store and
kept it open round-the-clock every day of the year. After Bean's
death in 1967 at age 94, his grandson, Leon A. Gorman, expanded the
business, taking its appeal beyond hunters and fishermen to
outdoors enthusiasts of all types.
   But as Bean's business grew, Freeport's economic heart - shoe
manufacturing - began to slump, in the early 1980s.
   Town Manager Dale Olmstead recalls that when he first moved to
Freeport in 1982, ``the downtown was quite rundown.''
   Things began looking up in the summer of 1982 when Dansk opened
the first name-brand outlet in downtown Freeport.
   ``Apparently,'' Andrew said, ``the wizards of the `where do you
put stores' business decided this was a happening place and, boom,
look what happened. As the '80s heated up, business in Freeport
just grew and grew. Freeport has achieved critical mass as a
shopping destination.''
   Word of Freeport's shopping attractions quickly spread along the
tour bus and tourist circuit.
   When promoting Maine, Gleason said, tourism officials will
``sell lobsters, the beautiful rocky coast of Maine and they'll
sell L.L. Bean.''
   ``Bus tours, if they can fit it in their itinerary, will always
stop in Freeport,'' she said. ``I've seen as many as 16 to 30 buses
in here on a busy day.''
   ``I think we've weathered (the recession) better than other
communities,'' said Olmstead, the town manager.
   Mrs. Wentworth and her husband ran a dry cleaning service on
Main Street from 1953 until they sold their building in 1984 at the
start of the outlet boom.
   Paul Wentworth acknowledges the couple made a tidy profit on the
sale, but still laments what the outlet boom has done to life in
Freeport.
   ``They don't sell the products you need for everyday life since
this commercial explosion started,'' he said.
   Like other Freeport residents, the Wentworths must drive eight
miles north to Brunswick or five miles south to Yarmouth to shop in
a supermarket.
   The couple lives a half-mile from the center of town, but say
it's easier to walk downtown than drive because of the traffic
congestion.
   ``On a weekend, you might run out of gas driving around trying
to find a parking place,'' Wentworth said with a rueful laugh.
   ``There are so many ways it isn't the same town anymore,'' Mrs.
Wentworth said with a sigh. ``I think it's just been a lot of
hassle.''

<HEAD>Milli Vanilli Has Company in Synch Alongs</HEAD>

   Is it better for a pop star to look good than to
sound good? In the age of MTV, it certainly can't hurt - as 7
million Milli Vanilli fans found out.
   But fans of Rob and Fab, the pretty boy dancers who fronted as
Milli Vanilli, are not alone in discovering their chart-climbing
stars have more in common with the Wizard of Oz than with Prince.
   The voices behind Technotronic's ``Pump Up The Jam'' and
Blackbox's ``Everybody Everybody'' are not necessarily the tall,
luscious models featured on album covers and videos; they are two
less videogenic women behind the scenes.
   ``Welcome to the modern pop jungle, where big or butch women
don't satisfy MTV's lust,'' the Village Voice said recently in a
piece on the lip-synch flap.
   The question is not limited to who's singing on the record;
there's also the question of who's singing on stage. The use of
taped music and vocals in live performances is rumored for many
artists, including Madonna and New Kids on the Block.
   ``Certainly, in this video generation of the past 10 years,
having a band or an artist with THE look is critically important,''
acknowledged Abbey Konowitch, MTV's senior vice president. ``It
doesn't have to be good-looking - but it has to be a look.''
   And the Vanillis?
   ``I'm sure a great part of Milli Vanilli's success is due to the
fact they're unusual, great-looking guy,'' said Konowitch.
   Such talk annoys veteran rocker Graham Nash, who's combined with
David Crosby and Stephen Stills to provide some of the finest vocal
harmonies ever recorded.
   ``It's totally preposterous. If you can't cut it, don't do it,''
Nash said of the seen-but-not-heard bands. ``Lip-synching might be
OK at the Ice Capades, when you're doing the march of the Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles, but not at a rock 'n' roll show.''
   The importance of appearance in pop music is nothing new. The
Beatles arrived in the United States with matching haircuts and
wardrobe 26 years ago; the Sex Pistols arrived a generation later
with clothes to match their attitudes.
   But the MTV generation has placed a new emphasis on looks. The
diminutive, baseball-capped Ya Kid K - the voice of Technotronic's
``Pump Up The Jam'' - was replaced in the video by lanky model
Felly.
   Martha Wash, who says she is the voice on Blackbox's hit single
``Everybody Everybody,'' instead saw 6-foot model Katrin Quinol on
the cover of the 12-inch single.
   ``We have been told Katrin is part of the group, but in no way
was she the only female voice,'' said Marilyn Lipsius, a BMG
Records spokeswoman. ``Martha definitely sang on it, and nobody
ever denied that.''
   Wash is suing RCA Records, BMG's parent company, over the song,
says her attorney, Steven Ames Brown. She has a similar suit
pending against A&amp;M Records alleging her vocals were ripped off by
the group Seduction on ``I'm Your One and Only,'' he said.
   A spokesman for RCA said the company would have a response but
never produced one.
   The Vanillis were lean, mean dancing machines. Wash, on the
other hand, was one-half of Two Tons of Fun, the hefty backup
singers for the late Sylvester and a successful duet as the Weather
Girls.
   ``America is about pretty surfaces,'' says music publicist Bill
Adler. ``If it were simply about musical talent, Bo Diddley would
be a lot bigger than Elvis.''
   Things have been popping since the Millis were exposed and
stripped of their Grammy. Copies of their records were destroyed;
lawsuits alleging fraud have been filed by fans in California and
Chicago; lawmakers in Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey and
Michigan are considering legislation over live performance
lip-synching.
   Yet producer Frank Farian, the mastermind behind the fabulous
faker boys, offered no apologies. And neither did their record
company.
   ``It was a wonderful act. Fans loved the music. Everybody was
happy,'' Farian said before the split hit their fans.
   The Millis were particularly criticized for lyp-synching live,
but they don't stand alone. High-energy, choreographed shows by
Janet Jackson or the New Kids on the Block leave the singers
gasping for air; several such acts are rumored to enhance their
shows with prerecorded sound.
   Nash says CSN's chances of making it big in today's music
business would be slim - unlike his hefty singing partner Crosby.
``Crosby has style? Well, a certain style, for sure, but not
stacked boots and all that,'' he said laughing.
   ``I'm not sure how artists from the past would fare,'' said
Adler. ``I mean, Bob Dylan's videos are kind of lame, even though
he's electrifying in person.''

   Zhou Lihong, seven months pregnant, has no home
of her own and shares a tiny room in a company dormitory with two
other women. Her husband, who works for the same firm, lives
upstairs.
   The company offered part of an old house that had no gas, heat
or plumbing, but the young couple rejected it, gambling that a
better offer would come. They have no guarantees.
   While the Zhous wait and hope, suitable apartments are empty.
   One is in the name of Yan Fields, a Chinese woman who followed
her American husband to the United States four years ago, and rents
for the equivalent of just $1 a month.
   It is too valuable to give up and her parents don't want to
sublet for fear of attracting attention that might cause them to
lose the apartment.
   Housing problems are most acute in the major cities. Officials
said one-fourth of Beijing's residents lack adequate
acccommodations.
   An apartment shortage is not the entire problem. The system of
housing distribution, through employers, lends itself to inequities
and abuse.
   Government programs have had limited success in improving the
situation.
   In 1988, a few cities began raising rents and selling apartments
to tenants to finance construction of more housing, but the reforms
have not been applied nationwide. Many local officials blocked
them, unwilling to pay the higher rents or lose the power they get
from assigning scarce apartments.
   Housing officials insist the reforms have not been abandoned.
They say 30 counties and 19 cities, including parts of Beijing,
Shanghai and Canton, are following the new policies on a limited
scale.
   Nearly everyone in China has a roof over his head, but he shares
it with many more people than Americans do.
   The average living area for a Chinese is 81 square feet,
according to government figures. In the United States, says the
National Association of Homebuilders, the average person has 755
square feet.
   A Shanghai newspaper wrote about a couple who lived in a single
room with an aging father.
   After four years of marriage, they remained childless and the
husband was convinced lack of privacy was the reason. They borrowed
an apartment for five months and the wife became pregnant.
   Employers determine whether a young couple get their own
apartment. Companies distribute housing by seniority, and both
husband and wife have a chance to be assigned an apartment by their
respective employers.
   A worker who has connections to the company housing official may
get a larger apartment than he needs. Rents are so low there is no
reason not to obtain as much space as possible.
   Rents for an average three-room apartment in Beijing range from
the equivalent of 34 cents a month to $1.14.
   Officials say the average Chinese spends less than 1 percent of
his income on housing, compared with 15 percent in the United
States. In the late 1950s, Chinese spent 6 percent to 10 percent of
income on rent and officials want to return to that level by the
end of this decade.
   ``Rent is so low that it takes years to recover'' a new
building's cost, said Zhang Yuanduan, director of the Construction
Ministry's real estate department.
   Most new buildings soon begin deteriorating because rent often
doesn't even pay the cost of maintenance, and Chinese are being
born at the rate of more than 30 a minute, too fast for new
construction to keep pace.
   In outlying parts of Beijing and some companies where the
housing reforms are being introduced, rents have risen to the
equivalent of $6.30 a month for a three-room apartment.
   The city built 314 new apartments and offered them for sale at
prices much closer to the real cost - an average of $18,250, or 40
times the average annual wage - said Liu Qi, deputy director of
Beijing's Housing Reform Office.
   Buyers snapped up the apartments, borrowing money from relatives
abroad or taking out bank loans.
   Liu said some companies in Beijing were following suit and had
sold nearly 4,000 apartments to workers in the past two years,
generally at lower prices than the city. Proceeds are used to
renovate old housing and build new apartments.
   A local government in Liaoning, northeastern China, earned
enough from selling apartments and raising rents to build 120 new
dormitories in less than three years. In the past, it had been able
to build only one or two in the same period, said Zhang of the
Construction Ministry.

   Aaron Copland, the pioneering
composer who used folk songs and jazz in writing plainspoken
classics such as ``Appalachian Spring,'' ``Lincoln Portrait'' and
``Billy the Kid,'' died Sunday at age 90.
   Copland, who lived in Peekskill, died at Phelps Memorial
Hospital in Westchester from pneumonia with respiratory failure
following two recent strokes, hospital spokeswoman Ann Marie
Treanor said Sunday night.
   Admired by colleagues as the ``dean of American music,'' Copland
was a major force in gaining international recognition for the
nation's 20th century composers. His honors included a Pulitzer
Prize, a Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Guggenheim Foundation's
first music fellowship and an Oscar.
   Vivian Perlis, with whom he wrote his memoir, said Copland ``had
the unusual ability to reach a wide audience and at the same time
he composed some of the masterworks of the century that were highly
respected by other musicians.''
   She added: ``He put American music on the map. He decided that
there should be an American sound, a place for the American
composer.''
   Among his better known works were the score for ``The Red
Pony,'' the 1949 movie based on the novel by John Steinbeck, and
``Lincoln Portrait,'' music performed with narration inspired by
the writing of Carl Sandberg.
   Other noted pieces included ``Fanfare for the Common Man,''
written in 1942.
   ``He was the composer who would lead American music out of the
wilderness,'' the late Leonard Bernstein wrote in High Fidelity
magazine for the occasion of Copland's 70th birthday. ``He was The
Leader, the one to whom the young always came with their
compositions.''
   Composer William Schumann said he, Copland and Bernstein were
close friends for many years and formed a ``triumvirate'' among
American composers.
   ``I think Aaron created the American sound in symphonic music,''
Schumann said. ``He has not only been for a half-century the
pre-eminent American composer, but a remarkable force as an
influence with younger composers.''
   He added: ``Copland believed in the validity of American music,
and that we were not inferior to our European cousins.''
   Copland wrote two operas, six ballets and eight film scores,
including his Oscar-winning music for William Wyler's ``The
Heiress'' in 1948. He was a pianist, conductor, author and
educator, guiding numerous musicians including Bernstein.
   Copland won his Pulitzer and the New York Music Critics Circle
Award in 1945 for ``Appalachian Spring,'' which he wrote for Martha
Graham to accompany her choreography based on a Hart Crane poem.
Among the composition's most famous themes: a Shaker melody played
by clarinet and followed by five variations.
   His ballets ``Billy the Kid'' and ``Rodeo'' also combined cowboy
tunes and folk songs with original themes.
   Despite his success, Copland stopped composing after 1967,
spending much of his time at his home and directing recordings of
his works.
   One reason for his decision to stop composing was the rejection
by young composers of his ``Inscape,'' his first attempt at the
highly structured, atonal 12-tone system.
   Born Nov. 14, 1900, Copland was the youngest of five children.
His parents, immigrants from Eastern Europe, owned a neighborhood
department store in Brooklyn.
   Copland's maternal grandfather, Aaron Mittenthal, moved to
Dallas and opened a dry goods store there in the 1870s. According
to Copland family lore, Jesse James' brother, Frank, worked in the
store, attracting customers but stealing the profits, forcing
Mittenthal to eeturn to New York.
   Perlis, co-author of his 1984 memoir ``Copland,'' suggests that
lineage is one reason a Jewish boy from Brooklyn could write cowboy
music, though he did not travel to the West until he was 28.
   Copland provided his own explanation: ``I preferred to imagine
being on a horse without actually getting on one!''
   His first work was a song composed at about age 8 for his
mother. About three years later, he gave up after two pages of
``Music for opera, Zenatello, Act I.'' His first complete work was
a song, ``Lola,'' written at age 14.
   But Copland's parents were reluctant to pay for music lessons.
   ``My parents were of the opinion that enough money had been
invested in the musical training of the four older children, with
meager results,'' he once recalled.
   Copland's persistence prevailed. At 16, he began harmony lessons
with Rubin Goldmark, who taught another Brooklynite, George
Gershwin.
   In 1920, Copland was the first to be accepted to the French
government's summer music school for Americans at the palace of
Fontainbleau. He studied harmony in Paris with Nadia Boulanger, and
sold a composition, ``The Cat and the Mouse,'' for $32.50.
   ``To finally see my music printed means more to me than any
debut in Carnegie Hall,'' he wrote home.
   Copland was part of a talented group of Americans who studied
with Boulanger, including Virgil Thompson, Walter Piston, Roy
Harris, David Diamond and Elliott Carter, who remembered Copland on
Sunday night as being ``extremely helpful to his musical
colleagues.''
   The brightest musical light in Paris when Copland was there was
Igor Stravinsky, whose pounding, primitive ballet ``The Rite of
Spring'' caused a riot at its 1913 premiere.
   Copland was struck by Stravinsky's use of Russian folk material:
``I have no doubt that this strongly influenced me to try to find a
way to a distinctively American music.''
   In 1923, Boulanger introduced Copland to Serge Koussevitzky, who
would take over the Boston Symphony Orchestra the next year.
Copland played his ``Cortege macabre'' on the piano, and composer
Serge Prokofiev, who was also at the house, blurted out ``Too much
bassi ostinati.''
   However, Koussevitzky promised to conduct the piece in Boston,
and asked Copland to compose an organ concerto for Boulanger. A
shaken Copland later asked his teacher, ``Do you really think I can
do it?''
   ``She pointed a finger at me. `You can do it.' And when
Mademoiselle said, `You can do it,' that was the end of the
discussion,'' Copland recalled.
   Copland returned to New York in 1924 to complete the ``Symphony
for Organ and Orchestra,'' which Boulanger premiered in New York in
1925 at her U.S. debut.
   Afterward, Copland recalled, conductor Walter Damrosch addressed
the audience: ``Ladies and gentlemen. I am sure you will agree that
if a gifted young man can write a symphony like this at 23 ...
within five years he will be ready to commit murder.''
   Copland laughed along with the audience, but for years Damrosch
worried whether the composer understood he was joking.
   The same year, Copland won the first Guggenheim Fellowship in
music, worth $2,500.
   Koussevitzky commissioned Copland's ``Music for the Theatre,''
and introduced his ``Piano Concerto,'' both jazz-inspired
compositions.
   The concerto, written in 1926, used frequently changing rhythms.
``I felt I had gone to the extreme of where jazz could take me, the
audiences and critics in Boston all thought I had gone too far,''
Copland recalled.
   In 1928, during his first trip to the West, Copland heard the
piece hissed during rehearsal and again in concert at the Hollywood
Bowl.
   His 1942 ``Rodeo'' launched Agnes DeMille in her dancing career.
   Copland also helped organize Cos Cob Press, which published
music of composers rejected by established publishers. He founded
the Young Composers' Group, which helped Thompson, Bernard Herrmann
and others.
   Copland never married and left no survivors.
   An old friend, the late playwright Harold Clurman, once told
Perlis that ``the only ambition I ever heard him remark on was, `I
want to be remembered.'''

<HEAD>`Semiramide' Returns to Met after 95 Years</HEAD>

   Rossini's ``Semiramide'' returned to the
Metropolitan Opera, where it was last heard in 1895.
   Mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne, portrying a man, and bass Samuel
Ramey are masters of this kind of florid singing, with enough vocal
flexibility to trill three notes where operas written later would
have one note.
   Despite the debut of Lella Cuberli with her delicate voice in
the title role Friday, it was Horne's and Ramey's night, especially
Horne's. She conveyed not only lush, secure sound but the assurance
she knows what the music in this 1823 opera is all about.
   Cuberli is from Austin, Texas, and a graduate of Southern
Methodist University. She has been specializing in Rossini roles,
mainly in Europe and regularly at La Scala, since 1975. Semiramide
gives her one of the most beautiful arias in opera.
   Chris Merritt, a tall, large tenor from Oklahoma City, who
attended Oklahoma City University, also made his Met debut. He has
specialized in bel canto operas, by Rossini, Bellini and Donizetti,
mostly in Europe. His voice is warm and very attractive in its
middle register. It thins out when he sings high, though he can hit
the top notes.
   Young Ok Shin, from Korea, also made her Met debut.
   The vocal range required for performers in ``Semiramide'' makes
it pointless to present if an adequate cast can't be assembled.
This cast is better than just capable, in voice, style and stamina.
   Gaetano Rossi based the libretto on a tragedy by Voltaire.
Semiramide, queen of Babylon, had a prince (Ramey) kill her husband
15 years before. He hopes to become king. Semiramide falls in love
with a young army commander (Horne). The high priest - sung
commendably by John Cheek - reveals that this is her son Arsace.
Arsace tries to kill the prince but his mother steps between them
and dies. The priest has the prince arrested. Arsace becomes king.
   Arias and duets are long so stage action is static.
   John Copley's new production is beautiful. Michael Stennett has
designed lots of gold-encrusted costumes, without aiming for a
certain period.

   The long-delayed Columbia flight is
commanded by Vance Brand, a veteran of three previous missions and
the oldest person to fly in space.
   Columbia's seven-member crew also includes four astronomers who
will take turns manning the $150 million Astro observatory. The
scientists will operate the observatory's three ultraviolet
telescopes, while an X-ray telescope will be managed by computer
commands from the ground.
   Two crew members are payload specialists, non-space-agency
employees who will help operate the observatory. It is the first
time since the Challenger accident that payload specialists have
flown aboard a shuttle.

<TEXT>
   At age 59, Brand is the oldest person to fly in space. He said
Columbia probably will be his last flight.
   ``I'll probably move on to a management job, a second career if
you will, at this late day. But, frankly, there isn't anything that
beats flying in space,'' Brand said in an interview earlier this
year.
   Two other astronauts are older than Brand, but neither has flown
for five or more years.
   Brand joined the astronaut corps in 1966 after serving in the
Marines as a naval aviator and working as a test pilot for Lockheed
Aircraft Corp.
   His three previous trips into space included the historic July
1975 Apollo-Soyuz linkup, the first fully operational shuttle
flight in November 1982 and the 10th shuttle flight in February
1984.
   Although some astronauts have left the highflying career to
assume management roles in the space agency or pursue other
interests, Brand has been happy to stay and wait his turn for
mission assignments.
   ``I suppose a lot of people would do this until their 90 years
old if they could,'' he said.
   But he conceded that the problem now is getting back in the long
line again.
   Brand was born in Longmont, Colo., where he graduated from
Longmont High School. He earned a bachelor's degree in business and
in aeronautical engineering from the University of Colorado and a
master's degree in business administration from the University of
California at Los Angeles.
   He is married and has six children.

   Columbia pilot Guy Gardner, an Air Force colonel, has made one
previous trip into space aboard a secret military flight in
December 1988.
   The flight, the second shuttle mission after the Challenger
accident, carried an all-military crew. This time, Gardner is the
sole active military man among the seven crew members.
   During the 10-day mission, Gardner will steer the shuttle while
two other astronauts on his shift operate the Astro observatory.
The crew is divided into two groups so that work can continue
around the clock.
   Gardner, 42, grew up in Alexandria, Va., where he graduated from
George Washington High School. He earned a bachelor's in
engineering sciences, astronautics and math from the Air Force
Academy and a master's in astronautics from Purdue.
   He flew 177 combat missions in Southeast Asia in the early 1970s
and later attended the Air Force Test Pilot School at Edwards Air
Force Base, Calif.
   Gardner was selected as an astronaut in May 1980. He is married
and has three children.
   ``I've wanted to be an astronaut since I was a kid because I've
always been interested in outer space,'' Gardner said.
   In elementary school, he read science fiction books and dreamed
of exploring the heavens. Astronauts then were test pilots, and
that fact guided him during his military career, he said.
   After the Columbia flight, Gardner said, he plans to get back in
line for another mission. He hopes to command a flight.

   Mike Lounge, one of three mission specialists aboard Columbia,
has flown in space twice before, including the first
post-Challenger flight.
   Lounge, the crew's flight engineer, will guide the orbiter 12
hours daily while two astronomers operate the observatory. He also
is trained to perform an emergency spacewalk if necessary.
   Although his pilot duties should keep him busy, Lounge said he
hopes to find some time to look out the window.
   ``You never get tired of that,'' he said.
   Lounge, 44, grew up in Burlington, Colo., and graduated from
Burlington High School. He earned a bachelor's in physics and math
from the Naval Academy and a master's in astrogeophysics from the
University of Colorado.
   He joined the Navy in 1969 and spent the next nine years on
various assignments.
   In 1974, he became a physics instructor at the Naval Academy.
Two years later, he transferred to the Navy Space Project office in
Washington as a staff project officer.
   He resigned his regular Navy commission in 1978 and joined the
Naval Air Reserve. He is a lieutenant colonel in the Texas Air
National Guard.
   Lounge has three children. His wife, Kathryn, is a payload
integration manager at the Johnson Space Center.
   He began working at the space center in 1978 as an engineer and
was selected as an astronaut two years later.
   Lounge first flew into space on a 1985 shuttle flight. Three
years later, he was a crew member aboard the first shuttle to fly
after the Challenger explosion.

   Mission specialist Robert Parker, one of four astronomers on
board who will operate the Astro observatory, is making his second
trip into space. He also flew on the first Spacelab mission in
1988.
   The 53-year-old astronaut said in an interview earlier this year
that the most challenging part of the mission will be to get the
observatory working.
   ``I'm especially looking forward to the fun of going observing
(in space) for a whole week,'' he added.
   Parker was born in New York City but grew up in Shrewsbury,
Mass. He earned a bachelor's degree in astronomy and physics from
Amherst College and a doctorate in astronomy from the California
Institute of Technology.
   After being selected as an astronaut in 1967, he served on
astronaut ground support crews for the Apollo 15 and 17 missions
and as program scientist for the Skylab program director's office.
   For a year beginning in 1988, he was director of the space
flight-space station integration office at NASA headquarters in
Washington.
   He and his wife have four children.

<HEAD>Low Cholesterol Steaks From Cattle Brought by Columbus</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Monday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM H. HEATH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maybe Columbus didn't really
discover America - the locals met him on the beach - but he brought
a hedge against cholesterol 500 years before everybody started
worrying about it.
   Argentine ranchers believe criollos, descendants of the hardy
cattle Columbus carried across the sea, can be the basis of new
crossbreeds that will produce leaner steaks for a diet-conscious
age.
   ``Columbus brought the first cattle to the New World on his
second voyage in 1493, and more on his third and fourth trips,''
said Dr. Sol L. Rabasa, a genetecist.
   ``You can accurately say the animals that subsequently populated
the Americas, from the Texas longhorn in the north to what we call
criollo cattle in Latin America, are their direct descendants.''
   Rabasa is president of the 6-year-old Argentine Criollo Cattle
Breeders Association, which is rescuing criollos from
near-extinction, and breeds them on his ranch near Villa Canas, 185
miles west of Buenos Aires.
   He said the criollo and its crossbreeds convert food to muscle
efficiently and produce leaner meat with less marbled fat.
   The Spanish word criollo is used throughout Latin America to
denote people or animals born in the Americas of European
parentage.
   Despite nearly five centuries of independent development, Rabasa
said, the Texas longhorn and Argentine criollo have the same long,
angular, short-haired body and the same colors - brown, red or
piebald.
   Carlos E. Dawney, a rancher and association officer, said the
only real difference is in the horns that give the Texas breed its
name - ``often 60 inches from tip to tip, longer than ours.''
   Rabasa believes Columbus chose the cattle from the arid regions
near Spain's southern ports, selecting animals that were ``gentle
for easy handling and hardy to stand the long trip in cramped
quarters.''
   They were used to establish breeding herds on Cuba and Hispanola
in the Caribbean. From there, they were taken to Mexico, the
Isthmus of Panama and to Peru for distribution through Spain's
South American colonies.
   Criollos arrived in Argentina in the mid-1500s and soon
multiplied into tens of thousands on the pampa, one of the world's
finest natural grazing lands.
   Argentina exported hides, but there was no way to preserve meat
for export and most of it was left to rot.
   Faster ships and use of salt as a preservative made ranching
highly profitable by the 1830s. To boost production, cattlemen
imported such faster-growing British breeds as the Hereford,
shorthorn and Aberdeen Angus.
   Zebu breeds from India, slow-growing and tough but resistant to
heat and disease, were introduced in semitropical northern
Argentina.
   Soon the criollo was seen as inferior and began to disappear,
absorbed by the herds of newcomers or banished to the least
hospitable areas.
   Rabasa, 75, is a former university rector noted for research. He
became interested in the criollo's potential 20 years ago when
ranchers asked him about the possibility of crossing it with Zebu
cattle.
   ``I had to tell them I didn't know, and we set out to find some
evidence,'' he said in an interview.
   A herd of Zebu-criollo crossbreeds was discovered on a ranch in
northwest Chaco province, and ``we found their production levels
and meat quality were surprisingly good,'' Rabasa said.
   Years of research by Rabasa and the National Institute of
Agricultural Technology followed, crossing the criollo with Zebu
and British breeds.
   Studies showed the criollo still had the gentleness prized by
Columbus, combined with superior fertility, body structure that
facilitates calving, resistance to disease and good milk
production, Rabasa said.
   ``The criollo calf gets up as soon as it is born and begins to
drink its mother's milk, allowing the mother to pass more of her
protective antibodies on to the calf during the first 24 hours,''
he said. ``The other breeds are slower to react and their calves
receive fewer antibodies.''
   Skin and eye pigmentation protect criollos and their crossbreeds
from cancers, conjunctivitis and other ailments provoked by the
bright sunlight prevalent in much of the Americas, the geneticist
said.
   Criollos also need water less often and can spend more time
searching for food over a larger area, making them ideal for
marginal land.
   Rabasa and his associates began a search for pure criollos
remaining in Argentina.
   They found them in pockets of the arid, thorn-forested Chaco and
in La Rioja, a desert province. A wild herd turned up in the
Glaciers National Park of southern Patagonia's Andean foothills
about 185 miles from the Strait of Magellan.
   Registered criollo cattle now number between 1,000 and 2,000 and
about 50 commercial herds use them as breeding stock.
   Rabasa said efforts to preserve criollo cattle are under way in
other countries, including the United States, ``where a gread deal
is being done.''

   The Curatolas owned a fixer-upper with a
romantic wraparound porch. They had a jeep-style car with the
requisite two kids in back, summer barbecues for friends, and
chirping crickets to serenade them at night.
   It was a suburban dream, and the New York couple hated it.
   ``We had all these ideals about what we wanted in a home,'' said
Gerry Curatola. ``Rolling hills and country roads, lots of acreage.
It was very romantic ... but it wasn't reality. The suburbs weren't
home.''
   Many middle-class families have chosen to move away from
Manhattan, where violence is on the rise and everything else often
seems in decline. But for the Curatolas, the city was home - crime,
dirt, noise and all.
   ``The most important element of anywhere you live is time
together as a family,'' Curatola, a dentist, said recently.
``That's the important priority - not commuting, fixing the house,
doing this or doing that.''
   Curatola and his wife, Georgia, moved back into the city last
spring after fewer than four years in their Westchester County
dream house. They couldn't take the ``good life'' any longer.
   For every leisurely weekend in their backyard, Gerry had at
least 10 new 1{-hour commutes notched on his briefcase. For every
pleasant morning with her husband, Georgia endured many long,
lonely afternoons.
   ``I think women in particular are very affected by a move like
that,'' said Mrs. Curatola, whose young daughter and son provided
her some relief. ``I don't play tennis and I don't do clubs.''
   Without those suburban mainstays, she said, the isolation
sometimes was overwhelming. Her days were taken up in solitary
journeys to the market, the dry cleaners, to her 6-year-old
daughter's school.
   On the Upper West Side of Manhattan, where the couple now lives,
neighbors meet on the elevator. Standing in line at the bank or at
the deli, there's always something to joke about. Central Park is
the family's backyard.
   The Curatolas know the streets are dangerous and that the public
schools are a mess. But they also know Fifth Avenue's Christmas
lights, the Guggenheim Museum's art and Carnegie Hall's music.
There's nothing like Little Italy's pasta or the charm of Greenwich
Village on a blustery fall day.
   The Curatolas want their children to experience the city's
wonderful mishmash of ethnicities and eccentricities - the very
things the Mitzners miss.
   Barbara and Marvin Mitzner, both 44, had their child in mind
when they moved to the New York suburb of Pound Ridge six years
ago.
   ``We thought the school systems were so excellent. But they
aren't what they're pumped up to be,'' said Mrs. Mitzner, whose
5{-year-old daughter is attending private school. ``The local
kindergarten was appalling.''
   The unsatisfactory schools wouldn't be so bad on their own, Mrs.
Mitzner said. But add in the many meals her huband arrives home too
late to share, the perpetual home repairs, aloof neighbors, the
driving everywhere all the time.
   ``Pound Ridge is ... a lovely, lovely place. But it isn't all
it's cracked up to be, particularly for a couple that has grown up
with the excitement of city life,'' said Marvin Mitzner, a partner
at the New York law firm of Davidoff &amp; Malido.
   ``Getting out of the city didn't turn out to be what we thought
it might,'' he said, adding that a lot of his friends shared
similar feelings.
   There are no statistics on the number of families abandoning the
suburbs. But the Mitzners, who have put their home on the market,
are among a group of suburbanites disillusioned by their
experience.
   Demographers predicted two decades ago that the baby boomers
would choose either rural or urban lifestyles. This rebellious
generation, sociologists theorized, would settle anywhere but in
the suburbs where they were raised.
   The experts were wrong. When working couples started families in
the 1980s, many of those who could afford to opted for the suburbs
as a practical compromise between city and country living.
   It's a forumula that hasn't worked for everyone.
   ``We were making enough money where we wanted to make an
investment,'' said Deborah Hassan, who with her husband chose the
the New York suburb of Scarsdale, where the median home price is
$535,000. ``Within a month after we moved out there, our neighbors
put up a fence. It felt so isolated.''
   Before the year was out, the Hassans and their 3-year-old
daughter were back in Manhattan. ``It's not easy living in the city
with a kid,'' said Mrs. Hassan, who works part time at American
Express.
   ``But I have this feeling about the city,'' she said. ``There's
always someone in the park for my daughter to play with.''

   Dr. Glenn Fishman and his wife, Joanne
Wallenstein, wanted to stick it out in New York. But the city wore
them down.
   Their car was broken into eight times in 12 months. They were
mugged, hassled by homeless beggars, frightened on the subway at
night. They didn't want to witness the final urban terror: murder.
   More than a home, the couple and their two young children
finally sought a haven here, in this gabled suburb about 40 minutes
from New York by train.
   ``We feel bad abandoning the city,'' said Fishman, a researcher
at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. ``But the problems seem to
be growing at such a clip that a lot of people ... are finding it's
a good time to make a move.''
   Added his wife, Joanne: ``It's sad for the city.''
   There is much for the city to mourn. Statistics usually reserved
for Harlem and Flatbush are touching ``safe'' neighborhoods. It is
more difficult for people to ignore the violence, step over the
many beggars in their path.
   New York's welfare caseload numbers 830,000 - greater than the
population of all but America's 10 largest cities. Someone is
robbed every six minutes and an average of 366 cars are stolen
daily. Among the subway users, about 200,000 jump the turnstiles
and ride free each day.
   ``Violence is reaching people it never reached before,'' said
Ellen Kaidanow, 30, an executive recruiter for The Gap Inc.
   ``It used to be that there were certain parts of Manhattan where
you felt relatively safe,'' said Mrs. Kaidanow, who is looking for
a suburban home where she and her husband can start a family. ``Now
the violence could be anywhere.''
   It is this sense of randomness that drives many couples back to
the secure, relatively quiet suburban lifestyle they knew as
children and, in many cases, swore off as young adults.
   The U.S. Census Bureau doesn't break down New York metropolitan
area migration, but suburban real estate agents say that weary
urban couples looking for a change lately have given their slumping
market a modest boost.
   ``Many think the city isn't getting any better and a lot ...
think it's going to get worse,'' said Merritt Mitchell, president
of the Westchester Multiple Listings Service. ``A lot of young
couples are looking to get out.''
   But along with the contents of their apartments, many ex-New
Yorkers end up bringing a sense of guilt with them to the suburbs,
where homes start at about $175,000. Their consciences suggest it
would be nobler to stay and fight for the city's future.
   ``But you have to look at it from a standpoint of
self-preservation,'' said Marc Tartell, 36, advertising director at
A&amp;W Brands Inc. ``Things felt out of control.''
   As the Tartells were packing up a moving van bound for
Westchester County in September, someone stole two suitcases
stuffed with their children's baby clothes. The theft was a final
kick in the pants, a reminder of why the longtime New Yorkers were
getting out.
   ``I like city living. I just don't like living in New York
anymore,'' said Barbara Tartell, 31, a vice president at Goldman,
Sachs &amp; Co. ``The presence of undesirable people is becoming more
obvious.''
   Jobless, angry, addicted young people used to hang out near the
Tartell's home on the Upper West Side. Their 3-year-old son already
was asking about prostitution, crack cocaine and homelessness.
   Their new two-story, five-bedroom colonial home is altogether
different. The kids have a backyard now, trees to swing from, a
street made for ``kick the can'' and neighborhood pals ready to
play such games.
   Local taxes are higher, but the public schools in Scarsdale
aren't overcrowded and underfunded like those in the city. And the
$7,500 kindergarten tuition the Tartells faced in New York was
anything but cheap.
   New suburbanites say they wish their kids could grow up with the
city's energy, culture and diversity. But those things mean
nothing, parents say, if their children are frightened,
stressed-out, constantly on edge.
   ``It's a fight or flight situation,'' said Charlie Clough, an
abstract artist who shares a Greenwich Village townhouse with his
wife and their two young sons. ``It's palpabl ... these are real
bullets going by.''
   Clough and his wife, Liz Trovato, started thinking about a move
after a sniper opened fire at their 10-year-old son's Little League
game.
   ``There I am, lying on the street with bullets whizzing overhead
and my son freaking out,'' said Trovato, a graphic designer. ``It
started us wondering whether there isn't a better way to live.''

   A bird thought to have become extinct in
recent decades has been turning up on the dinner plates of farmers
in Vietnam, the World Wildlife Fund for Nature says.
   Three of the rare birds - known as Vietnamese or Vo Quy's
pheasants - are currently in captivity in Hanoi, the Vietnamese
capital, according to the latest issue of World Wildlife Fund News.
   Vietnamese scientists called a search for the bird after hunters
in north-central Vietnam reported trapping and eating them
regularly.
   Local farmers were asked to keep alive any pheasants caught
bearing resemblance to the rare species.
   The pheasant was first discovered in 1964 by Vo Quy, a prominent
ornithologist who has spearheaded conservation efforts in Vietnam.
It was thought to have become extinct in the years that followed.
   Quy was quoted by World Wildlife Fund News as saying reserves
covering the bird's remaining area of forest habitat should be set
up urgently to ensure its survival.
   The three captive birds were seen at the Hanoi Zoo by Elizabeth
Kemf, author of the article and a recent book on environmental
problems in Vietnam.
   Quy also expressed concern for the fate of Vietnam's other
species of pheasant, eight of which are endangered.
   Hunting, logging and clearing of land for agriculture were cited
as responsible for the decline of all pheasant species in Vietnam.
   The Switzerland-based World Wildlife Fund deals with
environmental issues around the world.

<HEAD>100 Years After Birth of Parliament, Japan Struggles With
Democracy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Japan has a parliament that rarely decides things,
a leader who rarely leads and an entrenched bureaucracy that is
rarely challenged, but its unique brand of democracy seems to work.
   The Diet, as the parliament is known, survived a powerless
infancy and militarist-dominated middle age to reach its 100th
anniversary Nov. 29. But members and analysts say full maturity as
a democratic forum remains elusive.
   Western notions of social equality and Japanese notions of
social hierarchy are still at war in Asia's oldest national
legislature, and at the heart of Japan's conservative democracy.
   ``I'm among those who believe democracy in Japan is still not
quite mature,'' said Kazu Aichi, a leading legislator from the
governing Liberal Democratic Party. ``It doesn't really appear that
true debates take place within the Diet. They're almost
perfunctory, ceremonial.''
   In part, that is because Liberal Democrats have been in power 35
years, since the party was formed. The leading ``permanent
opposition'' parties, which espouse a leftist ideology, have failed
to present a persuasive alternative to policies that helped build
Japan's powerful economy.
   To some degree, the government resembles a ghost of the feudal
past, despite the vast changes in Japan since World War II.
   Powerful leaders of Liberal Democratic factions, dispensing
patronage in the manner of America's old political machines, run
the country in alliance with government bureaucrats and big
business.
   Together, the conservative oligarchs perpetuate the image of a
faceless ``Japan, Inc.,'' an industrial powerhouse built with the
savings of compliant consumers.
   Japanese bureaucrats are an elite who attract graduates of the
best universities. The profession's cachet dates from the samurai
gentry who remade feudal Japan into a Westernized power in a single
generation of the late 19th century.
   Bureaucrats write the government legislation, which gives them
enormous leverage on policy.
   ``I would hesitate to call it true democracy if most decisions
are not publicly made in the Diet,'' said Shinichi Kitaoka, a
political scientist at Rikkyo University.
   Nor are most decisions made by the prime minister. Some analysts
consider Japan's prime minister the least powerful leader of a
major industrialized nations.
   ``When I was working in the U.S. in 1982-83, then-Prime Minister
(Yasuhiro) Nakasone came to visit,'' Kitaoka said. ``An American
friend said to me, `Your leader is now in Washington.' I thought,
`Leader?' I could not get what he meant, even as a political
scientist.''
   ``Japan is a consensual society,'' Aichi said. ``It is just not
the type of society in which the top leader makes decisions and
everyone else follows. So in that sense Japan is a very democratic
nation.''
   That has led some to question how Japan, despite its economic
eminence, can become a leader internationally. The issue gained
currency during months of hesitant government maneuvering, with
little result, over sending military personnel to the Persian Gulf.
   ``This is one of the major problems facing politicians in Japan
today,'' said Aichi, who sees no prospect of reforming the system
soon.
   Perhaps the strongest endorsement of Japanese democracy is that
it seems to work.
   Japanese sometimes say they have the largest middle class in the
world.
   In government surveys, 90 percent of those responding describe
themselves as middle class. That is partly because of the nation's
affluence and partly because of reforms during the postwar U.S.
occupation that redistributed land and property.
   The redistribution created a huge conservative constituency, the
new landowners, and deprived the opposition Socialist and Communist
parties of a natural underclass to represent.
   Many of today's ruling oligarchs rose from humble families
through sheer ability.
   ``The truth is that Japan, like the United States, has woven the
threads of democratic political life - civil liberties, open
elections, competitive politics and responsible government - into
the fabric of the nation's social structure to create a stable
political system that echoes universal values and behavior while at
the same time being utterly unique,'' Gerald Curtis, an expert on
Japanese politics at Columbia University, wrote recently.
   Some commentators say the best proof that Japan is becoming a
true democracy is a new calm in public political debate.
   Some experts were impressed by the collective yawn with which
many Japanese treated recent constitutional debates of involvement
in the Persian Gulf and aspects of Emperor Akihito's enthronement.
   Similar issues testing Japan's ``peace constitution'' aroused
widespread violence and protests in the 1950s and 1960s, when the
specter of the militarism that plunged Japan into the disastrous
war was still vivid.
   ``It didn't have the dimensions of a systemic crisis this
time,'' said J. Victor Koschmann, a Cornell University expert in
modern Japanese history working in Japan. ``People didn't feel that
institutions were being trampled on. Maybe the sense of threat has
receded.''
   Because of Japan's economic success, he said, ``all those traits
that were once vilified abroad, everyone now wants to imitate. That
kind of thing can give people a sense that `We were OK all the
time'.''

   Mission specialist Jeffrey Hoffman, a veteran of one previous
shuttle mission, said he is looking forward to working as ``a real
astronomer'' in space during the Columbia mission.
   ``We get to be astronomers. It really is a great mission,''
Hoffman said in an interview earlier this year.
   Hoffman, 46, flew on a 1985 mission during which he made an
emergency spacewalk in an unsuccessful attempt to rescue a
malfunctioning satellite.
   While his main duty during the Columbia flight is to help
operate the Astro observatory, Hoffman also is trained to perform a
spacewalk if needed during the mission.
   ``We're not planning to do it, but if it happens, we're ready,''
he said.
   Hoffman already has plans to go into space again on a shuttle
mission scheduled for September 1991.
   He grew up in Scarsdale, N.Y. He earned a bachelor's in
astronomy, graduating with highest honors from Amherst College.
   Hoffman earned a doctorate in astrophysics from Harvard in 1971
and a masters' degree in materials science from Rice University in
1988.
   Before he was selected as an astronaut in 1978, Hoffman worked
on several scientific assignments involving research on X-ray data
from several satellites.
   He is married and has two children.

   Ronald A. Parise is one of two payload specialists specifically
assigned to the flight to help operate the Astro observatory.
   Parise and Samuel Durrance are the first non-space agency
shuttle passengers since the 1986 Challenger explosion. Seven
astronauts died in the explosion, including teacher Christa
McAuliffe and Hughes Aircraft engineer Gregory Jarvis.
   ``I'm ready to go. I've been ready for a long time,'' Parise
said in an interview.
   Parise has spent a decade designing and developing the
ultraviolet imaging telescope, one of the Astro instruments, and
said that 10 years of work ``seems like a long time, but it's
certainly gone fast.''
   Payload specialists are not members of NASA's astronaut corps
but undergo extensive training for a shuttle flight.
   Parise, 39, was born in Warren, Ohio. He earned a bachelor's in
physics from Youngstown State University in Ohio. He also earned a
master's and a doctorate in astronomy from the University of
Florida.
   Parise is a senior scientist in the space observatories
department at Computer Sciences Corp. in Silver Spring, Md.
   He is married and has two children.

   Samuel Durrance, the second payload specialist aboard the
flight, waited years to fly into space but was nearly scrapped from
the Columbia crew earlier this year.
   Durrance, 47, an astronomer and research scientist at Johns
Hopkins University, was cleared for flight aboard Columbia in June
following a health evaluation.
   NASA said Durrance is ``medically qualified'' to take part in
the mission, but the space agency has declined to elaborate on the
problem that almost kept him from flying.
   Durrance said he started working on the Astro project in 1982
and was finally picked to fly on a shuttle mission to operate the
observatory two years later.
   ``My feelings about the Astro are great. I've been working on it
for a long time,'' he said.
   Durrance grew up in Tampa, Fla., and earned a bachelor of
science degree and a master's in physics from California State
University. He later earned a doctorate in astrogeophysics from the
University of Colorado.
   But he hasn't always had his sights set on the stars.
   Durrance, who built race cars when he was a teen-ager, said he
didn't really become interested in the space program until the
Apollo missions. He decided to pursue a career in science, although
he didn't really aspire to become an astronaut.
   At Johns Hopkins, he is assistant project scientist for the
Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope, which is part of the Astro
observatory. His main interests are in the origin and evolution of
planets.
   He is married and has two children.

<HEAD>Did Thatcher Leave a Better Britain Than She Found?</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   When Margaret Thatcher left 10 Downing Street last
week, she said she was proud to be leaving the country in much
better shape than she found it in 1979.
   But did she? The debate goes on.
   ``On the central crucial questions - the state of the economy,
the competitiveness of Britain in the world markets, the level of
inflation - I'm afraid the record is not good,'' said David
Marquand, a professor of politics at the University of Salford.
   One of Mrs. Thatcher's boasts as prime minister was that her
Conservative government had increased the standard of living in
Britain.
   Per capita gross domestic product climbed from $5,700 in 1979 to
$14,860 a decade later, while the national average gross weekly
income rose to $589 from $234.
   The number of people below half the national average income,
however, doubled to 10 million during the decade.
   ``It's a mixed bag,'' said Jonathan Leape, who teaches economics
at the London School of Economics. ``The growth in the last 10
years has led to a bigger pie but to a much less well-distributed
pie, so that people at the low end have not benefitted as much as
the people on the top end.''
   Mrs. Thatcher presided over an eight-year economic boom, the
longest since World War II. British economic growth outstripped
growth in Germany and France, after lagging during the previous two
decades, Trade Secretary Peter Lilley said in an interview on
Independent Television.
   ``We have managed to slough off the heritage of socialism and
transform the economy,'' said Lilley, a loyal Thatcherite.
   But the opposition Labor Party's spokesman on the economy, John
Smith, retorted that Mrs. Thatcher created false growth through a
credit boom.
   Now the economy is in a recession and is not expected to turn
upward until the second half of 1991.
   During her tenure, Mrs. Thatcher championed free market
policies, believing fervently in deregulation, free enterprise and
competition.
   She sold $64 billion worth of state-owned companies, and more
than tripled the number of shareholders to 11 million, or 24
percent of the population.
   Mrs. Thatcher also slashed and simplified taxes. Britain's top
tax bracket got the biggest reduction, from 83 percent to 40
percent, while the basic rate dropped from 33 percent to 25
percent.
   Wanting to encourage home ownership, she sold more than 1.5
million government-owned dwellings to their tenants.
   But many new homeowners are struggling to pay adjustable rate
mortgages. They climbed along with Britain's base lending rate,
which stood at 15 percent for a year, until it came down to 14
percent in October.
   Mrs. Thatcher curbed Britain's militant trade unions with
legislation that required unions to hold referendums before going
on strike. The number of days lost to strikes shrank to 4.1 million
last year from 29.5 million in 1979. Union membership has fallen to
8.4 million from 12 million.
   Mrs. Thatcher also tried to wean Britons off the welfare state,
but spending on social security programs has gone up 41 percent in
real terms in the past decade.
   She put a tight grip on public spending, turning budget deficits
into budget surpluses. But Britain's infrastructure suffered and
the number of homeless has increased, critics say.
   She oversaw the deregulation of the financial markets under the
so-called Big Bang, which allowed more players into the market,
abolished minimum commissions, allowed banks to enter the
securities business and permitted foreign firms to join the Stock
Exchange.
   But the stock market boom evaporated in the October 1987 stock
market crash. Low trading volume has hurt profits and forced job
cutbacks at many investment firms.
   The critics also say Big Bang, which brought higher salaries,
bonuses and stock options, created a ``yuppie class,'' reviled by
many for its market speculation and flashy lifestyles. While Mrs.
Thatcher sought to promote self-reliance and industriousness, she
instead fostered greed and selfishness, they say.
   Britain enjoyed a five-year real estate boom, but now lots of
office space goes begging for tenants, particularly in the
Docklands, the huge east London development that was to exemplify
the best of Thatcherism.
   Among her other achievements, Mrs. Thatcher took inflation from
18 percent down to 3 percent in 1986. But it has climbed back up to
10.9 percent, higher than the 10.3 percent rate that she inherited
in 1979.
   She got 17 percent interest rates as low as 7.5 percent. But
they too have bounced back up.
   The current number of unemployed is 1.7 million people, and
climbing - higher than 1.1 million in 1979. The figure went as high
as 3 million during Mrs. Thatcher's tenure.

<HEAD>Urban Officials Say Aging, Diverse Population Will Change Cities'
Role</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSAN FAHLGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cities are getting more ethnically diverse and
their inhabitants are aging, demands that cit  governments must
answer, urban leaders said Sunday.
   ``We're seeing a demographic wave that will transform entire
regions,'' said former San Antonio Mayor Henry Cisneros at the 67th
annual convention of the National League of Cities.
   He moderated a panel of mayors, city council members, county
commissioners and borough presidents, who addressed the impact of
these changes on electoral politics and the populace.
   More white women and members of minorities are winning election
to top spots in cities and counties. At the same time, the white
urban population is growing older while minority populations are
the youngest and fastest growing in the nation, Cisneros said.
   In 10 years, 92 percent of Californians will live in a city with
a population consisting of at least 30 percent Asian, Hispanic or
black residents, he said.
   Similarly, only 15 percent of those entering the job market in
2000 will be white males; 85 percent will be women and minorities.
   ``These figures present dramatic implications about what we do
for the planning of the future cities,'' Cisneros said.
   Panel members predicted difficulty in paying for bond issues for
things as school improvements because the tax base in cities
comprises older people on fixed incomes and the urban poor.
   Ruth Messinger, president of the New York City borough of
Manhattan, said cities will need to address the need for day care
and more education for families, including bilingual instruction,
to keep residents working and paying taxes.
   St. Petersburg, Fla., Mayor Robert Ulrich offered a different
perspective. He said the aging population should be regarded as an
asset able to provide untapped resources in the form of public
service.
   One example was offered by Mayor Maynard Jackson of Atlanta,
where the city supports a program that brings together retired
people with single-parent families to provide day care and
employment at the same time.
   Michael Woo, a Los Angeles city councilman, suggested better
programming for English instruction.
   ``I would like to see a common language,'' said Woo. ``I believe
in ESL (English as a Second Language), but it would help if we did
a better job. If high schools were able to produce not only
English-proficient minority students, but also the blond and
blue-eyed variety.''
   Cleveland Mayor Michael White said cities must offer fairness to
their constituents and enfranchisement to minorities.
   ``As long as this country commits $500 billion to bankrupt
savings and loans; as long as this country spends $4 billion to $6
billion on Iraq and Kuwait; as long as this country continues to
lock in black kids, brown kids and poor white kids into an economic
system to which there is no end to the tunnel, then it will
continue to get worse,'' White said.

<HEAD>Colonial Williamsburg Hopes Early Retirements Will Offset Losses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN HAYWOOD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WILLIAMSBURG, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This restored colonial capital has long
been a magnet for tourists lured by a city that once echoed with
the speeches of the nation's founding fathers. Lately, however, the
visitor count has dropped.
   Tourism is down 10 percent for the year, prompting the
foundation that operates the 173-acre attraction to offer hundreds
of employees early retirement in hopes of saving about $1 million.
   Williamsburg became capital of England's Virginia colony in 1699
when nearby Jamestown burned to the ground. It was the colonial
capital until 1776 and capital of Virginia until 1779.
   The city southeast of Richmond was the scene of the convention
of 1776 that instructed George Washington and other Virginia
delegates to the Continental Congress. The nation's second oldest
college, William and Mary, was founded here in 1693.
   Nowadays, guides wearing three-cornered hats, swords, knee-pants
and stockings - or bonnets and dresses with aprons - answer
questions about the 18th century. There are demonstrations by
silversmiths, shoemakers and other craftsmen.
   Employees had mixed reactions to the early retirement offer by
the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, which owns four hotels and 11
restaurants.
   The plan was offered last month to employees who are at least 55
years old and have at least 10 years with the foundation. About 360
employees are eligible, 8.6 percent of the foundation's work force
of 4,200.
   Foundation spokesman Albert O. Louer said about 150 people were
expected to retire early. The deadline for acceptance is Dec. 19.
   Those who take the offer will get credit for five more years of
employment, continued health and life insurance, and a pension
supplement until they qualify for Social Security at age 62.
   ``We're taking it step by step so we can reach a comfortable
level that's appropriate to make sure we're financially sound,''
Louer said. ``This program should be a major factor.''
   Bill Jones, a waiter at Christiana Campbell's Tavern, said he
probably will reject the offer. He has worked for the foundation
for 37 years and will be 62 in two months.
   ``At the moment it's really not that much of an enticement for
me,'' Jones said.
   However, Baxter Hardinge, a store and post office manager and a
nine-year employee, said he's sorry he is ineligible.
   ``In order for the company to grow, it would be a good move,''
he said.
   Tourism here was down even before there were signs of a national
recession, which only makes things worse, said Roy L. Pearson,
director of the College of William and Mary's Bureau of Business
Research.
   He said 1990 has been the third worst year for Williamsburg
tourism, exceeded only by the recession years of 1974 and 1982.
   Colonial Williamsburg opened in 1932 after a six-year
restoration project paid for by John D. Rockefeller Jr. About 1
million visitors are expected this year, down from 1.17 million in
1989.
   Daylong passes cost $21 to $24.50 for adults and provide
entrance to various exhibits and restored buildings. There are also
numerous restaurants and shops.
   ``Williamsburg's tourism growth ended prior to any slowdown
nationally,'' Pearson wrote in his Williamsburg Business Index.
``If we were that vulnerable when others were doing well, then we
truly are at risk now that the external economy has stopped
growing.''

   Mark David Chapman says that he feels great
remorse for killing John Lennon but that the slaying doesn't make
him an evil person.
   ``You can't judge a man's life by one act. Before I became `The
man who murdered John Lennon,' I was basically a decent person,''
Chapman said from his isolation cell at Attica state prison, where
he is serving 20 years to life.
   In the interview in Sunday's Rochester Democrat and Chronicle,
Chapman said he suffered mental dissolution for years before
killing the former Beatle on Dec. 8, 1980 outside Lennon's
apartment building in New York City.
   ``I'm not an evil person,'' said Chapman. ``Like everybody,
there's a small part within me that's evil, and that's what took
over in my case. My energies turned foul and went toward something
destructive.''
   Chapman said he looks upon Lennon as ``a seeker of truth.''
   ``It was an end of innocence for that time,'' Chapman said.
``And I regret being the one that ended it.''

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Whoopi Goldberg was named black Entertainer
of the Year and won best supporting actress honors for her role in
``Ghost'' at the NAACP Image Awards.
   Morgan Freeman won best film actor for his role as a chauffeur
in ``Driving Miss Daisy'' Saturday night at the 23rd annual awards
honoring black achievement.
   No award was given this year for best female actress because of
the paucity of roles for black women, the NAACP said. It said the
lack of nominees was a sign of ``the imbalance and irresponsibility
of the film industry.''
   In the music category, Quincy Jones won the best album award for
``Back on the Block,'' and Luther Vandross received best male
recording artist honors.
   Best vocal group honors went to the Whispers for their album
``More of the Night,'' and Etta James won best blues artist for her
singing on ``Stickin' to My Guns.'' Best jazz artist was Jonathan
Butler for ``Deliverance.''
   Best rap group was M.C. Hammer for ``Please Hammer Don't Hurt
'Em.'' Anita Baker won best female artist for ``Compositions,'' and
the Winans were named best gospel artists for ``Return.''
   The show will be televised Jan. 16 on NBC.

   LOS ALAMITOS, Calif. (AP) - Burt Lancaster remained in serious
condition from a stroke that left him weak on his right side and
affected his speech.
   Lancaster was resting Sunday at Los Alamitos Medical Center,
where nursing supervisor Ardi Smith said the 77-year-old actor's
condition was ``basically unchanged.''
   Lancaster, who has starred in more than 60 movies and won an
Oscar in 1960 for his portrayal of an evangelist in ``Elmer
Gantry,'' had been listed in serious condition Friday, when he
collapsed and was taken to the hospital.
   ``He's having some difficulty with speech,'' Smith said. ``But
at the request of the family, I'm not able to say more than that.''

not who Robin Leach is. And when I wake up in the morning, I wink
at myself because I like me. I know who I am.''
   ``Lifestyles,'' now in its eighth year, is carried on 168

   RADNOR, Pa. (AP) - Ed Begley Jr., the father in television's
``Parenthood,'' says when he applied for his driver's license at 16
he learned who his real mother was from his birth certificate.
   Begley, now 41, said in the Dec. 8 issue of TV Guide it took him
some time to adjust to the fact his father's first wife was not his
mother, as he had assumed.
   ``It's pretty strange when you think one woman is your mother
and you find out it's another woman,'' he said. ``That lady who
used to bring you Lincoln Logs? Yeah, I remember her. Well, for
good reason, son. That's your mom.''
   Begley said he gets along great with his mother, whom he knew as
a family friend during his childhood.
   The name of the woman, an NBC page and part-time actress, was
not revealed.

   The amount of money raised in the fourth annual Caring for
Babies With AIDS on Sunday was not immediately available.
   Arnaz, the daughter of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, stars as
Tess Hammersmith, a single professional woman raising an adopted
daughter and coping with an extended family this season in the CBS

   RADNOR, Pa. (AP) - ``Guest star to the world'' is how Jay
Thomas, the abrasive tbloid-TV host Jerry Gold on ``Murphy
Brown,'' describes his career.
   ``It's almost like I have this fit for three hours every morning
- and then go to work,'' Thomas said in the Dec. 8 issue of TV
Guide.
   Los Angeles radio listeners know Thomas as ``The Morning Zoo''
host on radio station KPWR-FM. On his weekday ``nothing is sacred''
show, he trashes everything, including his Emmy nomination for
``Murphy Brown.''
   Then it's off to the set of his current show - ``Married
People'' - as Russell Meyers, a yuppie writer and househusband.
Thomas also plays hockey goalie Eddie LeBec on ``Cheers'' and was
deli owner Remo DaVinci on ``Mork &amp; Mindy.''

<HEAD>Report Says `Good Professor' Must Mean `Good Teacher'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Colleges are shortchanging students and faculty
alike by prizing professors' research far more than their teaching
or their social commitment, a report says.
   ``Scholarship Reconsidered: Priorities of the Professoriate,''
released Sunday by the Carnegie Endowment for the Advancement of
Teaching, takes academia to task for shunning involvement in
solving problems outside the ivory tower.
   ``What we urgently need today is a more inclusive view of what
it means to be a scholar - a recognition that knowledge is acquired
through research, through synthesis, through practice and through
teaching,'' said the study by foundation president Ernest L. Boyer.
   The report called on college officials to base tenure decisions
on teaching skills and community involvement as well as scholarly
publications. And it urged campuses to include the views of past
and present students in evaluating professors for tenure or
promotions.
   ``In the current climate, students all too often are the
losers,'' said the report.
   ``In glossy brochures, they're assured that teaching is
important, that a spirit of community pervades the campus, and that
general education is the core of the undergraduate experience.
   ``But the reality is that, on far too many campuses, teaching is
not well rewarded, and faculty who spend too much time counseling
and advising students may diminish their prospects for tenure and
promotion.''
   ``Good teaching is assumed, not rewarded,'' said a math
professor quoted anonymously in the report. ``The administrators
and many faculty don't regard extra time spent with students as
time well spent. This is the most frustrating aspect of my work.''
   A 1989 Carnegie survey of 5,450 college faculty found 62 percent
agreed that teaching effectiveness, not publication, should be the
primary criterion for promotion.
   Colleges too rarely reward professors for devoting their time
and ideas to topics like school reform, banking or health care, the
report said.
   It cited comments by Harvard President Derek Bok pointing out
that it was non-academicians such as Rachel Carson, Ralph Nader and
Betty Friedan who blazed the trails for the environmental, consumer
and feminist movements.
   Ernst Benjamin, general secretary of the American Association of
University Professors, praised the report, saying it ``accurately
describes the dependence of collegiate instruction on scholarship
in a manner which appreciates the strengths of American higher
education and shows how to use these strengths to improve it.''
   In an interview, Boyer expressed optimism that the stiffening
competition for college-age students will lead educators to heed
the report's message.
   Students ``want their money's worth,'' he said. ``The pressures
on undergraduate institutions will increase because as the pricing
goes up, there are growing questions about what you get for your
investment.''

<HEAD>The Future of Gotti: Will Power Equal Prosecution?</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A street hit from the pages of ``The Godfather''
allegedly transformed John Gotti into the nation's most powerful
crime boss. But five years later, Gotti faces the mobster's fatal
equation: power plus prestige equals prosecution.
   ``Right now he is the No. 1 target of law enforcement. ... It's
just a matter of time. He's going to go,'' said Jules Bonalovonta,
head of the FBI's organized crime office in New York.
   Bonalovonta has history on his side. From Al Capone to Joe
Bonanno, godfathers have turned grandfathers while behind bars.
   The heads of four of the city's five organized crime families
were convicted and sentenced to 100 years in prison each in 1986.
The fifth - Paul Castellano - never heard those verdicts. He was
gunned down months earlier in Gotti's alleged grandstand play for
control of the Gambino family.
   But claiming Gotti killed Castellano is one thing; proving it is
another. He has never been charged in the killing, although a
much-rumored racketeering indictment including the hit is
reportedly due this month.
   Three times Gotti has appeared in New York City courts on other
charges, and three times he has walked outaa free man, earning the
nickname ``The Teflon Don.'' The acquittals, combined with his
reputation for violence and fine clothing, have given Gotti
national notoriety.
   Yet that image may bring his downfall, experts say. Castellano's
approach - described by one as ``much more sophisticated
racketeering than Gotti's'' and therefore harder to detect and
prosecute - is more conducive to a lengthy stay at the head of an
organized crime family, they believe.
   Unless, of course, somebody inside the organization decides to
kill you nine days before Christmas.
   ``Paul Castellano was a class act. He was the emerging racketeer
of the '90s. There's a great variance between Mr. Gotti and Mr.
Castellano,'' said Fred Martens, director of the Pennsylvania Crime
Commission.
   ``One was a businessman racketeer, the other is a plain
old-fashioned gangster, right out of the '20s. That's the
difference.''
   Castellano's style, which included the creation of citywide
concrete scam that netted millions and an aversion to drug
trafficking, was in marked contrast to the Gambinos under Gotti,
investigators say.
   ``Castellano seemed shrewder. He kept a low profile, and he also
bridged the legitimate and illegitimate worlds, which gave him a
little more freedom,'' said Michael Chertoff, acting U.S. attorney
in Newark.
   Chertoff was prosecuting Castellano and the heads of the four
other mob families when the reputed Gambino boss and bodyguard
Thomas Bilotti were gunned down Dec. 16, 1985, outside a midtown
Manhattan steakhouse.
   Gotti's attorney, Bruce Cutler, noted his client is often linked
to the slaying, but asserted Gotti's innocence.
   ``Take this poor Mr. Castellano who was killed. How many times
have the newspapers said my client had something to do with this?
He didn't,'' said Cutler.
   Chertoff believes ``Big Paul,'' in some ways, wielded more power
than Gotti.
   ``Gotti seems powerful, but that may be because the other bosses
are gone,'' said Chertoff. ``Gotti is high profile, he has an aura,
but that's media stuff. That doesn't translate into real power.''
   Real power is cash and soldiers. Gotti has plenty of both; he
has increased the number of ``made'' - or initiated - family
members since taking over, said Bonalovonta. Most of the new
members deal drugs, he said.
   The Gambino forces now number about 500 made members, he
estimated.
   The Gambinos' other sources of income remain the same: gambling,
extortion, loan-sharking, union control, airport rip-offs and
dominance of the garment district.
   Although the Gambino family is the strongest financially,
Gotti's reign has seen its share of problems.
   Thomas Gambino, son of late family boss Carlo, has been indicted
for allegedly controlling the garment district through extortion
and coercion. Gene Gotti, John's brother, is doing a 50-year
stretch for heroin trafficking. And Frank De Cicco, a trusted Gotti
underboss, was killed by a car bomb.
   The same fate could await the man his friends call Johnny Boy.
Gotti has twice been targeted for hits: once in a bungled attempt
outside the boss's Queens hangout, the Bergin Hunt and Fish Club,
and once by the Genovese family in a dispute.
   The gunman responsible for the first attempt was later found on
Staten Island with five bullets in his head; the second bid was
undercut when FBI agents got wind of the plans and warned Gotti.
   The brutal retaliation for the first attempt added to Gotti's
reputation, as did his three acquittals - on an assault case, a
racketeering trial and the shooting of a union official.

<HEAD>Cigarette Exports More Than Make Up For Domestic Sales Drop</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Overseas sales of U.S. cigarettes have risen
dramatically the last five years, more than offsetting a decline in
domestic use by health-conscious Americans, an Agriculture
Department report says.
   Cigarette output dropped 20 percent from 1981 to 1985. This
year, the report said, production may be up 3 percent from the 1985
level. Domestic use has dropped 12 percent since 1985, the report
said.
   ``The continued decline in U.S. cigarette consumption is due to
rising prices and taxes, slipping social acceptance, health
concerns, and restrictions on where people can smoke,'' the report
said.
   Further, analysts expect the decline in domestic cigarette use
to continue in the 1990s, perhaps by 3 percent or more each year.
   The report, by Verner N. Grise of the department's Economic
Research Service, is in the December issue of Agricultural Outlook
magazine, published by the agency.
   In 1985, sales abroad totaled 59 billion cigarettes. That is
down 29 percent from the peak of 83 billion ``pieces'' set in 1981.
   ``In 1990, the U.S. is probably exporting 160 billion
cigarettes, almost three times the 1985 mark,'' the report said.
``The phenomenal growth partly reflects lowered trade barriers in
Japan, Taiwan and South Korea.''
   Other factors have been the high quality of U.S. cigarettes,
rising incomes in importing countries, and the weakening of the
dollar against foreign currencies.
   Recent moves in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union toward
market-oriented systems also have spurred increased interest in
U.S. cigarettes.
   The Soviet Union has agreed with U.S. manufacturers to buy more
than 35 billion cigarettes over the next two years, with further
sales expected. The Soviets will swap goods for part of the
cigarettes, but the report said some analysts are concerned that
Moscow will have trouble finding hard currency to pay for the rest.
   Another indication of the growing foreign markets is a decision
by some U.S. companies to set up manufacturing plants in what was
East Germany, ``a strong sign of the region's hunger'' for American
cigarettes, the report said.
   Still another example is Thailand's agreement to abide by a
recent ruling by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade against
Thailand's 10-year ban on cigarette imports.
   ``Efforts to open the Thai market were hampered by an unusual
alliance between U.S. anti-smoking groups and the Thai tobacco
industry,'' the report said.
   At home, U.S. cigarettes are finding a tough market outlook. The
report cited a Gallup poll survey in July that indicated a growing
anti-smoking sentiment among Americans.
   ``Smoking restrictions have increased markedly and smoking is
now banned on all continental U.S. airline flights and all flights
to and from Alaska and Hawaii that last less than six hours,'' the
report said.
   Despite the tighter restrictions and declines in tobacco use,
Americans will spend a record $44 billion on tobacco products this
year, the report said. About 95 percent of that will be for
cigarettes.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Gross farm receipts from crop sales in 1991
could exceed $80 billion, up by as much as $5 billion from this
year's forecast, according to Agriculture Department economists.
   ``Pushed by low stocks and pulled by a strong livestock sector,
feed grain sales could increase as much as $3 billion,'' an outlook
conference report said last week. ``Corn receipts are likely to be
up 10 percent, while soybean receipts are expected to rise above
$11 billion.''
   Corn production in 1991 is expected to increase, if the
government's acreage reduction requirements are trimmed from this
year's 10 percent level, the report said.
   ``Some producers may opt not to participate in the government
program (in 1991), expanding their planted acreage, and increasing
their future base,'' it said.
   Soybean prices are anticipated to be stable but could be
dampened by large plantings on ``triple base'' acres, a feature of
the 1990 farm law that gives farmers more choice on using land.
   Direct payments to farmers in 1991 under the new law are
expected to drop 10 percent to 15 percent from this year.
   ---
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Turkey production almost doubled during the
1980s and is headed for another gain next year, according to
Agriculture Department projections.
   Total 1991 output is forecast at around 4.8 billion pounds. That
represents an increase of 5 percent to 7 percent from this year.
The 1990 increase was 9 percent.
   ``Average wholesale prices in 1991 are expected to remain nearly
the same as in 1990, with slight increases likely early in the
year,'' an outlook report said last week. ``Continued high prices
for red meats will help turkey prices, as will the support to the
market provided by the continued growth in purchases of processed
turkey meats.''
   Per capita consumption of turkey is expected to rise to more
than 19 pounds next year, up one pound from the 1990 average.

<HEAD>Priest With Messianic Appeal Leads Presidential Race in Haiti</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JACMEL, Haiti (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Church bells peal and a man with a
megaphone mimics a crowing rooster as the Rev. Jean-Bertrand
Aristide rides into town on horseback to be greeted by thousands of
adoring supporters.
   The fiery leftist priest, revered by the masses as a prophet, is
taking his remarkable quest for the presidency across Haiti in a
campaign imbued with messianic symbolism and patriotic fervor.
   He calls the campaign Operation ``Lavales,'' or Torrent, a
biblical flood to cleanse Haiti of corruption and tyranny; its
emblem is the fighting cock, representing Haiti's coming sunrise.
   ``With Aristide, Lord, there will be no dishonesty,'' the people
chant as the slight, bespectacled cleric nicknamed ``Titid''
appears in their midst.
   Aristide, 37, has survived at least three assassination attempts
and was expelled from his Roman Catholic order in 1988 for
preaching revolution. He is widely regarded as the frontrunner
among 11 candidates in the Dec. 16 election.
   Supporters say the charismatic priest offers the best hope of
giving the impoverished Caribbean nation not only the first
democratically elected president in its turbulent 186-year history,
but the stability of a government with huge popular support.
   Critics accuse Aristide of demagoguery and say his a presidency
based on emotional mass appeal would pose the threat of a
theocratic dictatorship.
   That appeal has been evident on campaign stops across the
country, from the slums of Port-au-Prince, the capital, to the
northern city of Cap-Haitien, where an estimated 60,000 people took
part in what was probably the biggest demonstration in the city's
history.
   In Jacmel, a crumbling port on the southern coast, perhaps 5,000
people, including hundreds of students in brown and blue school
uniforms, poured into the town square for a recent Aristide rally.
   Dismounting a horse he rode from the outskirts of the city,
Aristide plunged into one of his trademark question-response
orations in which the distinctions between national pride and
Christian love are blurred.
   Aristide: ``Young people, you know what it is to be lovesick?''
   Crowd: ``Yes!''
   Aristide: ``Are you in love with Haiti?''
   Crowd: ``Yes!''
   All sing the lilting ``Haiti Cherie,'' or ``Darling Haiti,''
which is to Haitians what ``America the Beautiful'' is to
Americans.
   Then Aristide: ``We are going to do away with injustice -
totally.''
   Together: ``Totally, totally, totally, totally, totally,
totally.''
   Aristide unexpectedly entered the presidential race in
mid-October after Roger Lafontant, reputed former head of the
Duvalier dictatorship's infamous Tonton Macoute militia, declared
his candidacy.
   Lafontant was later disqualified on a technicality.
   Although no opinion polls have been published, the consensus
among political observers is that Aristide commands much wider
support than any of Haiti's veteran politicians.
   ``Aristide is the figurehead of a messianic movement, the
incarnation of a collective dream,'' says Laennec Hurbon, a
specialist on religious movements in the Caribbean. ``His
responsibility to his following is not the same as that of a
politician to his constituency.''
   Aristide gained a nationwide following largely from radio
broadcasts of his electrifying sermons in which he railed against
successive military regimes that have ruled Haiti since the
February 1986, when Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier was driven
into exile.
   He is an adherent of liberation theology, which promotes
political and social awareness among the poor.
   In September 1988, thugs armed with guns, machetes and spikes
burst into Aristide's St. Jean Bosco Church during Mass, killing at
least 12 parishioners and wounding 70. Three months later,
Aristide, was expelled from the conservative Salesian Order for
refusing to tone down his rhetoric.
   The only other presidential candidate whose appeal approaches
Aristide's is the moderate Louis Dejoie Jr., who drew thousands of
supporters on a recent campaign swing of the southern peninsula.
   Marc Bazin, a former World Bank official frequently mentioned as
a favorite of the U.S. Embassy, which denies any preference, is
also seen as running strongly.
   Bazin's National Alliance for Democracy andPProgress, the
country's best-funded political machine, is expected to dominate
Parliament after the election. If Bazin fails to win the
presidency, he could still become prime minister since the
president must chose a prime minister from among the majority
party.
   Under Haiti's constitution, the president is head of state but
the prime minister runs the government. Aristide has said he would
``embrace'' the next prime minister, but many Haitians see the
potential for conflict.
   Voter registration has reached 3.3 million, or 92 percent of the
electorate, according to election officials - a phenomenon largely
attributed to Aristide's candidacy.

<HEAD>Report Urges End to Pro-IBM Bias in Computer Purchases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN FLESHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Computer purchasing officials in the Navy and
possibly in other government agencies have too cozy a relationship
with private-sector contractors such as IBM Corp., says a
congressional report issued today.
   The House Government Operations Committee report says there
should be stronger regulations and better oversight to eliminate
bias in awarding computer contracts.
   The report follows a year-long probe touched off by complaints
in 1988 from six IBM competitors who said they had been frozen out
of the Navy's multibillion-dollar computer market.
   ``Through a combination of agency malfeasance and the dominance
of one vendor, the fair and open system contemplated by Congress
has been torpedoed in Navy (computer) procurement,'' the report
says.
   It details ``a tangled web of agency and contractor abuse,
improprieties, and illegalities,'' said Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich.,
the committee chairman. ``It's an old story that when the rule of
law breaks down, it is the strong who benefit.''
   The committee said its investigation had been broadened to
include other agencies, including the National Institutes of
Health, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the
Treasury Department. All have large, complex computer systems and
are major computer equipment buyers.
   The report says IBM ``appears for the most part not to be
responsible for the bizarre Navy ... acquisition system, but merely
its willing beneficiary.''
   Former naval officer John Cahill testified during one hearing
that his commanding officer, while attending a free IBM promotional
training seminar, telephoned Cahill and ordered him to ``change our
procurement strategy to go after'' a new IBM technology, the report
said. Cahill said he refused and awarded the contract to another
company.
   The report described the officer's participation in the IBM
program as ``clearly improper.'' At least 128 Navy officials were
trained by IBM in San Jose, Calif., between 1985 and 1987.
   Navy Undersecretary J. Daniel Howard, in a Sept. 7 letter to
Conyers, said IBM's training of Cahill's superior was not an
illegal gratuity because IBM did not win the contract it sought.
But Howard acknowledged there was an ``appearance of impropriety.''
   The General Services Administration, the agency responsible for
overseeing government purchases of automated data processing
equipment, should take the lead in fixing the system to eliminate
bias, the report said.
   It said the GSA should review training programs and seminars
offered by computer contractors to determine whether they are
proper for government employees, and should issue clear guidelines
on contacts between federal buyers and contractors.
   GSA should review government computer purchases more frequently
and carefully, the report said. ``Agencies cannot be trusted to
follow the rules and regulations governing (computer)
acquisitions,'' it said.
   Navy spokesman Lt. James Wood would not comment beyond saying
that the Navy had cooperated with the committee during the
investigation.
   IBM spokesman Mark Holcomb said the company endorsed the
proposed review of policies on relations between the government and
private-sector computer companies.
   But he said it would be unfair if Congress, in ordering such a
review, implied that IBM's dealings with the Navy had been
improper.
   ``We did not do anything wrong,'' Holcomb said. ``If they want
to change the regulations after the fact, we will comply. But we're
in complete compliance with (existing) regulations and have been
all along.''

<HEAD>Students Help Create Civil Rights Museum at Lincoln Memorial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHILIP BRASHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The teen-agers listened spellbound as Rachelle
Horowitz recalled the sweltering day when Martin Luther King Jr.
stood just a few feet away down the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.
   For these budding historians, children of the me-decade '80s,
the civil rights movement had been an abstraction in a textbook.
   But the 17 students from high schools in 15 states and the
District of Columbia walked away from the memorial with a sense of
awe that they can convey to the millions of tourists who climb the
same steps each year.
   ``It's more exciting here than learning it in school,'' said
Barbara Burnette, a 19-year-old senior at Edison High School in
Minneapolis.
   ``With books, you're like, right, oh yeah. You've got to be
there to really get into it.''
   The students were selected to help the National Park Service
plan and raise money for a new museum inside the Lincoln Memorial
to honor the legacy of Lincoln, King and the nation's other leaders
in civil rights.
   ``I used to think Lincoln was just a great man who was tall and
wore a hat,'' said Maureen May, 17, of Copley, Ohio. ``But now I
want his ideals to come alive. I want everyone to know about his
legacy and to use it.''
   The students spent the past week in the Washington area talking
to park service planners, touring historic sites and listening to
people like Horowitz, who participated in the 1963 March on
Washington and other major demonstrations.
   Horowitz, then 23, was the transportation director for the March
on Washington.
   She pointed around the corner inside the memorial where U.S.
Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., a black student protest leader at the time,
hurriedly rewrote one of the opening speeches. She pointed down the
steps to the very spot where King stood and told the world, ``I
have a dream.''
   ``He silenced a quarter of a million people on a hot August
day,'' she told the students.
   Horowitz provided the students with the sights, sounds and the
sense of the throng spread out before King.
   The National Park Service has involved the students in planning
the Lincoln Memorial museum in a way that it has never used the
public before, said Jane Radford, a park service planner.
   ``This is not done in the museum business,'' she said. ``This
was particularly appropriate and very exciting because Lincoln's
legacy is often carried on by the youth of this country in protest
and demonstration.''
   The proposed museum capped a two-year effort begun by a
Scottsdale, Ariz., high school history class. The students were
upset that their state wouldn't honor King with a holiday.
   The students were picked by the American Federation of Teachers
and other organizations to represent a cross-section of ethnic
backgrounds. Their selection was based on a demonstrated interest
in Lincoln and good communication and leadership skills.
   Later they will coordinate a student drive to raise $300,000 for
the exhibit by collecting pennies.
   The students visited the park service's interpretative design
center in Harpers Ferry, W.Va., where they submitted their proposal
for an exhibit featuring interactive videos, continuous films,
computer quizzes, artifacts and recordings.
   The students came from high schools in Alabama, Arizona,
Colorado, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Florida,
Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, New Mexico, New York,
Ohio, Pennsylvania, Utah and Washington.

<TEXT>
   The recording sessions were held in Quonset
huts, on movie sets, in night clubs after hours. Some of the
biggest names in show business, from old-timers like Al Jolson to
newcomers like Frank Sinatra, performed.
   But the records, produced in a six-year period during and after
World War II, were heard only by American servicemen overseas. Now,
through the efforts of a retired Navy officer who helped oversee
their production, they are on the U.S. market.
   Nearly 920 12-inch, 78-rpm records were produced by the Army and
Navy from 1943 through 1949 as morale boosters. They were called
V-Discs. The records - 8 million copies altogether - were
accompanied by 125,000 spring-operated windup phonographs, each
with 100 steel needles.
   ``They were played on ships, in foxholes, in trenches, on
airplanes, in hospitals,'' said Edmond P. DiGiannantonio. Digi, as
he is known, ran the Navy's part of the program and keeps a
well-preserved copy of each record in a closet in his lakeside home
here.
   One serviceman wrote a letter saying he and his buddies were
playing a V-Disc as they headed to the D-Day invasion of Normandy,
DiGiannantonio said.
   The program was started after an Army musical branch captain
named Bob Vincent suggested to Army officials in Washington that
they get popular band leaders like Benny Goodman and Artie Shaw to
record for the troops.
   The colonel, Vincent's superior, said, ``Look, these guys don't
want to hear any swing music or any jazz; they want marching
music,'' DiGiannantonio recalled.
   The colonel's reluctance was overcome and ``we went on to
include all types of music in all releases,'' said DiGiannantonio.
``From Toscanini to Spike Jones. All the way.''
   When the Navy started looking for an officer to run the Navy,
Marine Corps and Coast Guard part of the program, DiGiannantonio
was in a hospital in Boston, recovering from wounds he suffered
when his ship, the heavy cruiser Vincennes, was sunk off
Guadalcanal.
   He had played violin, piano and saxophone in high school in
Boston and at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, held a
broadcast engineer's license and had recorded Shaw, Glenn Miller,
Goodman and other band leaders when they came to town.
   So he got the job.
   Along with each box of 20 or 30 records went copies of a
questionnaire asking the servicemen to say what kind of music they
wanted. ``White Christmas'' was the most requested piece. About 60
percent wanted jazz or swing, 20 percent or so classical and some
country and western or others. Marches didn't make it.
   Some of the music came from movie film tracks and transcriptions
of radio broadcasts, but many were live recordings by artists
donating their services.
   During the early years, they were the only records made. The
American Federation of Musicians, at odds with the recording
companies over royalties, had banned all recording until the
dispute was settled. Union President James Caesar Petrillo waived
the ban to permit the recordings for the troops.
   ``We recorded in night clubs, hotel ballrooms, movie studios,
Quonset huts, Army bases, Navy bases, wherever the artists were,''
said DiGiannantonio, now 73.
   ``In those days when you went on a job you traveled by bus all
night. They'd do a session and wind up at one or two in the
morning, and then come to a studio and lug all the instruments and
record for us.''
   The services had tried sending shellac records overseas earlier,
but found that most of them were broken before they arrived. The
V-discs were recorded on more durable vinylite. When vinylite
became scarce because it was critically needed for insulation, they
switched to Formvar, a product developed in Canada.
   Instructions on changing needles were often ignored, so many of
the records wore out overseas. Others were left behind when the war
ended. DiGiannantonio said that when the V-disc program ended,
officials ordered the remaining disks destroyed to prevent
commercial use.
   Nevertheless, the Library of Congress has a nearly complete set.
Their quality ``ranges from very good to poor, depending on the
source,'' said music librarian Sam Brylawski.
   ``Remember how heavy those old needles were,'' said Brylawski.
``That would gouge a record like a V-disc. If we got one from
someone who really liked their recording a lot, it could very well
be beat up.''
   DiGiannantonio took good care of his.
   They have been transferred to cassettes and compact discs, with
no adjustment of the original sound.
   ``Some people said let's enhance it, and do this or this,'' said
DiGiannantonio. ``But we said this is the way it was, and we are
going to do it that way.''
   DiGiannantonio said he has clearance from the Defense Department
to market the recordings, and is working with the American
Federation of Musicians and Broadcast Music Inc. about payment of
royalties.
   He said much of the profit will go to the musicians' union
retirement fund, or to the artists, their families, or their
estates.
   The first installment is a three-cassette set with 37 numbers
including Glenn Miller playing ``Chattanooga Choo Choo,'' Jolson
singing ``Mammy'' and Connie Boswell crooning ``Good Night,
Sweetheart.''

   Seventeen years after the government's
authority for a military draft expired, the Selective Service
System is alive and well - and on standby.
   But if President Bush and Congress gave the order, the Selective
Service could start issuing draft notices within days and supply up
to 100,000 young men within a month.
   Bush has said as recently as last week that he doesn't want to
see the draft reactivated, but it's the job of the Selective
Service to be ready - just in case.
   The agency has 270 fulltime employees, 2,000 local draft boards
and a entire system for resuming the draft if ordered to do so.
   ``It's business as usual because that is our mission - to be
ready,'' Selective Service spokeswoman Barbi Richardson said. ``We
were ready a year ago, and we'd be ready tomorrow.''
   However, Selective Service Director Samuel K. Lessey Jr. said
``our agency has had no indication that a draft is needed in
response to the Middle East crisis.''
   Still, the buildup of U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf has led to
growing public concern and debate about the draft, which was one of
the most divisive issues of the Vietnam War.
   Former Navy Secretary James Webb last week questioned Bush's
buildup of the troops in the gulf, but said ``if the president is
serious about going on the offensive, he should call for an
immediate resumption of the draft'' to avoid troop shortages.
   The president's authority to draft men into the armed forces,
which had been routinely renewed by Congress every four years,
expired on July 1, 1973, three months after the last U.S. soldiers
left Vietnam. The military then began depending only on voluntary
enlistments.
   Even if the draft were reinstated quickly, there would be a
significant time lag before conscripts reached the gulf. By law,
draftees may not be sent oversees for three months after induction.
   Lawrence Korb, a Brookings Institution analyst who was assistant
secretary of Defense for manpower until 1985, said it would take a
year to get conscripts trained and over to the gulf.
   ``I don't think it (the draft) is likely,'' Korb said.
``Militarily, it doesn't make sense.''
   Martin Binkin, another Brookings Institution analyst, said ``I
do not think that the average American kid has to worry about
conscription.''
   Many are worried nonetheless.
   ``We receive calls from mothers ... from the young men, their
wives, their girlfriends, their grandmothers, their grandfathers,''
the Selective Service's Ms. Richardson said. ``We let them know
there is no draft and we do not anticipate one.''
   David Treber of the National Interreligious Service Board for
Conscientious Objectors said his organization also is getting more
calls.
   ``We've even had mothers who have 14-year-old sons wanting to
get information,'' Treber said. Other calls come from college
students who say ```I registered for the draft a couple years ago
and never thought it would amount to anything and now I'm
worried,''' Treber said.
   James Blackwell of the Center for Strategic and International
Studies said the need for a draft may increase as voluntary
enlistments drop off due to concern about a possible war in the
Persian Gulf.
   ``The longer it lasts and the closer it comes to a shooting
conflict, the closer we come to a draft,'' he said.
   The Selective Service insists it is doing nothing unusual in
response to the troop buildup in the gulf.
   Should Congress authorize a return to the draft, the Selective
Service within hours or days could hold a lottery, based on dates
of birth, to determine the order in which men would be inducted,
Ms. Richardson said.
   Top priority for the draft would be young men who turned 20
during the same calendar year as the lottery. Young men already are
required to register with Selective Service when they turn 18.
   Once draft notices were issued, draftees would have 10 days to
report to a military processing station for examination and,
perhaps, immediate induction.
   Only after a young man got a draft notice could he file a
request to postpone or avoid military service. Reasons for a delay
might include an emergency such as serious illness or a death in
the family.
   Others might request classification as conscientious objectors
who oppose participation in war. They would be required to serve
either in a non-combat position or in a civilian job that benefited
the nation.
   Under one change that took effect near the end of the Vietnam
War, young men no longer can defer military service for years
because they are in college. Deferments now last only until the end
of the current semester.
   Requests to delay or avoid military service are considered by
local draft boards made up of trained volunteers. The five-member
boards meet yearly to consider sample cases - draft or no draft.

<HEAD>Conference On Blacks and Jews Looks to Build Coalition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY FOSTER</BYLINE>

   Blacks and Jews, who marched shoulder to
shoulder during the civil rights movement of the 1960s, have often
feuded since, but leaders of both groups are hoping an institute
founded here will help heal the rift.
   ``There is a need for a coalition of blacks and Jews,'' said
Dillard University President Dr. Samuel Dubois Cook, the man behind
the National Center for Black-Jewish Relations.
   ``We can do so many things together - fighting poverty, working
for social justice, getting blacks into the mainstream, improving
education and fighting common enemies.''
   More than 200 people were invited to the center for a two-day
conference titled ``Healing the Broken Community,'' which ended
Wednesday.
   ``This center is not only important, it's a model for the future
of our society,'' said Rabbi Robert J. Marx of Congregation Hakafa
in Glencoe, Ill., co-chairman of the Black-Jewish Dialogue in
Chicago and a speaker at the conference.
   Dillard, a predominantly black, nonsectarian liberal arts and
sciences college, gave $100,000 to the center when it was founded
this year and plans to raise up to $10 million for it.
   The program has been needed for a long time, said A.I. Botnick,
executive director of the South Central Region of the
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith.
   ``I went through the period of close coalition and common goals
the two communities shared in the 1960s,'' Botnick said. ``When
that fell apart, nothing was done to heal it. While some
individuals made attempts to find solutions, what were to be major
remedies became Band-Aids. This institute is the first effort of
its kind and it has great prospects for the entire nation.''
   While blacks and Jews during the 1960s were united in their
support for integration and voting rights, economic and ethnic
issues helped divide them over the next 20 years.
   For instance, former New York City Mayor Edward Koch was an
active supporter of the civil rights movement but later angered
blacks with his stiff opposition to hiring quotas and accusations
of anti-Semitism. In 1984, relations became especially tense after
a Washington Post reporter revealed the Rev. Jesse Jackson had
referred to Jews as ``hymie'' and New York City as ``Hymietown.''
   A conference in April 1989 examined the root causes of the
near-collapse of the alliance and revealed a widespread desire for
reconciliation, Cook said.
   ``It's criminal,'' Cook said. ``If there are any natural allies
in history, it should be blacks and Jews. For them not to be wrings
my heart. During the 1960s, the two groups played key roles in the
civil rights movement. We have been separated by a number of things
including some people in both groups who have said things that have
hurt us.''
   Most of last week's sessions were closed so that participants
could discuss issues frankly, Cook said. Workshops were set up on
economics, education and the role of the media and others in
pitting blacks and Jews against each other, Cook said.
   One man who may help unify the two groups is David Duke, the
Republican state representative and former Ku Klux Klan leader who
ran for the U.S. Senate.
   ``There are people and groups in this country who would like to
see the Jews and blacks wiped out. In addition to the positive
things that can flow from this conference, we can work together
against our common enemies like David Duke,'' Cook said.

   A delegation of South Dakota Indians prayed
on the lawn of a downtown Baghdad hotel and said they would offer
their sacred peace pipe to the Iraqi president.
   ``When President Saddam Hussein has prayed for peace the Teton
will return to the land of their ancestors and ask President Bush
to pray for peace also,'' Arvol Looking Horse said Sunday.
   He leads a seven-member delegation representing the elders of
the traditional Teton Sioux tribes, on a visit at the invitation of
the Iraqi government.
   After praying at the al-Rashid Hotel, Looking Horse said he
wanted the Iraqi government to organize the peace pipe ceremony.
Smokers of the pipe experience their true feelings, he said.
   ``The Teton believe that if all humans can speak the truth of
their hearts together all things are possible,'' said Garfield
Grass Rope, another member of the delegation.
   The delegatation leaves for home Tuesday.

   The work of five performers and musicians who
received the 1990 Kennedy Center honors has been characterized by
President Bush as emphasizing the ``crucial role'' the arts play in
American society.
   During a star-studded, black-tie White House reception Sunday
night, Bush honored jazz musician Dizzy Gillespie, actress
Katharine Hepburn, composer Jule Styne, director Billy Wilder and
opera singer Rise Stevens.
   The president paid personal tribute to each award winner,
describing Gillespie as a ``magician of the musical form,'' and
remembering Hepburn for her originality.
   The awards highlight the ``crucial role that art must play in
the fabric of our society,'' he said.
   Guests circulated at a cocktail party before leaving for a
Kennedy Center gala.
   Bush, meanwhile, left for a five-nation trip to Latin America.
   At the Kennedy Center, the five received stage tributes from -
among others - actors Bill Cosby, Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau and
opera singer Marilyn Horne during a show taped for television
broadcast Dec. 28.
   The show, hosted by television newsman Walter Cronkite, included
film clips of the lives and achievements of award recipients.
   Other personalities appearing in the show included columnist Art
Buchwald, and actors Glenn Close, Angela Lansbury and Hal Linden.
   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan and White House
chief of staff John Sununu were among the government officials in
the audience.

   Helmut Kohl's re-election campaign
showed the German chancellor in a new, self-assured style: more
elegantly dressed, relaxed, a better speaker.
   And the crowds were bigger, too, giving Kohl more enthusiastic
receptions than ever in his eight years as chancellor.
   Having delivered the unification of East and West Germany in
record time, Kohl had been heavily favored all along to win a third
four-year term.
   But in the last four weeks of the campaign, the 60-year-old Kohl
still made 28 campaign appearances, doing what he likes the best:
working the crowds and winning elections.
   One of the last was in southern Germany in Offenburg, pushing
his wheelchair-bound interior minister, Wolfgang Schaeuble, onto
the podium.
   Schaeuble barely survived an assassination attempt in October
and the gesture was vintage Kohl, a move that would strike the
hearts of ordinary Germans.
   But it was not only electioneering. Kohl was deeply moved by
Schaeuble's ordeal and had tears in his eyes when he had visited
the bedside of his trusted minister and possible successor.
   In Chemnitz, in former East Germany, before speaking at a
campaign rally, Kohl stopped at a local inn to have coffee and
banter with the owners.
   These are the times he says he likes the best, mingling with
ordinary people, when he feels like a ``farmer at the plough. You
can smell the earth.''
   According to nearly complete official returns, Kohl's
center-right governing coalition won 54.8 percent of the vote
Sunday, to 33.5 percent for the main opposition Social Democrats,
led by Oskar Lafontaine.
   Kohl became chancellor in October 1982, when a switch of
coalition alliances enabled him to form a government at the head of
his Christian Democratic Union. He was confirmed in national
elections in 1983 and 1987.
   At first he was regarded as a blunder-prone provincial
politician who spoke with a distinct local accent. But Kohl has
risen to the status of a respected international statesman, leader
of a country that will play a political role finally equal to its
economic might.
   ``In many fields of politics, we are in a leading position in
Europe and in the world,'' Kohl said recently.
   Often said in the past to be slow in making decisions, Kohl
seized the historic opportunity presented with the collapse of East
Germany's Communist government and the fall of the Berlin Wall a
year ago.
   ``I like to be underestimated. I've managed very well for 30
years by being underestimated,'' Kohl likes to say.
   His whirlwind, relentless drive to achieve quick unification
paid off when Germany became one fully sovereign state, on Oct. 3,
with Kohl as chancellor.
   His new image is reflected by trendier, double-breasted suits
and the virtual disappearance of Kohl jokes.
   Cartoons used to depict Kohl floating in outer space while aides
grappled with problems, or flipping coins to make decisions. Now
the 6-foot-5 chancellor is more likely to be depicted as a smiling
figure towering over the German landscape, as the newsweekly Der
Speigel showed him in a pre-election cover story on ``the lucky
giant.''
   Kohl was born on April 3, 1930, in Ludwigshafen, a southwest
German industrial city in a wine-growing region of the Rhine River.
His father was a minor revenue official and his mother a teacher.
   He earned a doctorate in political science from Heidelberg
University in 1958 and devoted his entire adult life to politics.
He joined the Christian Democratic Union in 1947 at the age of 17.
   Kohl served in various Rhineland-Palatinate state party posts.
He was elected governor in 1969 and took over as his party's
national chairman in 1973.
   The chancellor has been staunchly pro-American and went ahead
with the deployment of U.S. nuclear missiles in the 1980s despite
widespread popular opposition.
   He survived several scandals that shook Bonn - such as an
espionage affair in 1985 and a political payoffs scandal - and some
notorious gaffes.
   Kohl once compared Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
public relations skills to those of Nazi propaganda minister Joseph
Goebbels. Now he is said to be on first-name terms with Gorbachev,
whom he constantly praises as the man who made unification
possible.
   The chancellor and his wife, Hannelore, have two sons, Walter
and Peter. He is a staunch Roman Catholic who often stresses family
values.
   Kohl is said to feel uncomfortable abroad, but goes to Austria
for his annual slimming cure. He is not fluent in any foreign
language, but has been heard using some English.
   Kohl has said this may not be his last election and that his
goal remains the complete unification of Europe by the year 2000.

   Here are excerpts from a French television
interview with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, recorded Saturday
and broadcast Sunday. Saddam spoke in Arabic, and the French
transcript was translated into English by The Associated Press:
   Q: Do you accept the dialogue proposed to you by President Bush?
   A: If President Bush wishes to establish a balanced dialogue,
such a dialogue must not get under way on the basis of
preconditions. ... President Bush has proposed two meetings. ... We
have accepted.
   Q: What gesture are you ready to make to convince the world of
your good will as you begin this dialogue?
   A: There is no proposition more important than a dialogue that
reaches a solution to all the problems of the region, and at their
head the Palestinian problem. ... We have taken a series of
initiatives (regarding the hostages) and we have even fixed a date,
March 25, as the last date for all of them to go home if nothing
happens to disturb the peace.
   This is not a tactic to sow discord in the ranks of whomever,
but it is one of the means which we think is capable of preventing
war. Such a method has perhaps proven its effectiveness, because so
far there has been no war. ...
   We will free them (the hostages) ... as soon we have the
assurance that President Bush will not attack the Iraqi people
between now and March 25. If, after March 25, he still has the
devil in his head, we will rely on God in order to face any
eventuality.
   Q: Now that President Bush has proposed dialogue, and you can
save face to an extent, why not open up some possibility regarding
Kuwait?
   A: Our face is saved. We don't need Bush for that. Our face is
saved because we are believers. ... You know that Bush has not
taken the same measures vis-a-vis the Israeli occupation of
Palestine and doesn't even lift his little finger when he sees on
the television screens women, children and old people being killed,
humiliated and tortured in Palestine by the Israelis.
   The problem is that President Bush and the other Western heads
of state have two United Nations charters ... a criteria based on
evaluations of their own needs and interests and a criteria for the
oppressed peoples of the Third World - oppressed by the policies of
the Western bloc and by the United States in particular.
   Q: Is it necessary for a country like Iraq to provide itself
with a nuclear capability? The Americans say this will happen in a
year or two.
   A: I speak of the present. If we had nuclear weapons, we
wouldn't have any problem saying so. ... But we don't possess a
nuclear weapon ... Why doesn't the West protest and worry at the
destructive capabilities of Israel?
   Q: And this evening, are we closer to war or to peace?
   A: Fifty-fifty. If they want to make this meeting a real path
toward dialogue, then we are closer to peace. But if they want to
make this meeting nothing other than a formal exhibition for
Congress or international public opinion, simply to give themselves
good conscience to say, `There, we've tried dialogue with Iraq,
without Iraq renouncing its positions.' In that case, we're closer
to war.

<HEAD>Affirmed As Chancellor, Kohl Moves To Enhance Germany's Standing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's victory in all-German
elections gives him both the mandate to guide Germany to a stronger
role in world affairs and the burden of assimilating his nation's
troubled eastern lands.
   One of his first priorities, he indicated during the campaign,
will be to have Parliament consider changing the constitution to
permit sending troops to the Persian Gulf.
   At home, Kohl must focus on building up the former East Germany
and raising the living standards of its inhabitants, a process that
will cost hundreds of billions of dollars.
   After leading his Christian Democrat-led coalition to victory on
Sunday, Kohl predicted it will take jst three to four years to
develop the industrially backward eastern lands into a ``thriving
region.''
   ``We will achieve that,'' he told a television interviewer.
   Expanded influence in Eastern Europe and greater aid to the
Soviets also top the issues list for Kohl and the new 656-member
Parliament that links lawmakers from the eastern and western parts
of the country.
   An expanded international agenda and Kohl's confidence with it
signal another departure from the past. Previously, West Germany
hid cozily behind its NATO allies, following their lead on
international events.
   Even before Kohl led his country to unification with East
Germany two months ago, demands were growing for a united Germany
to take on greater international responsibilities.
   In September, Secretary of State James A. Baker III told Kohl
that ``being more means doing more,'' and there were suggestions of
giving Germany a permanent seat in the U.N. Security Council.
   The Germans politely turned down that suggestion, but the
international agenda is full as the 60-year-old Kohl heads into his
third four-year term.
   Kohl several times during the election campaign backed a
constitutional change that would allow German troops take part in
such missions the U.S.-led multinational force arrayed against
Iraq.
   He promised the new Parliament will consider the change soon.
   Such a constitutional amendment would be momentous in a country
still saddled by the murderous legacy of the Nazi past. Kohl says
the current constitution forbids German military missions outside
NATO areas.
   ``The united Germany is faced with a growing responsibility in
the community of nations, including the preservation of world
peace,'' Kohl said in a speech on Oct. 3, unification day.
   Germany already has promised to provide more than $2 billion
ollars in support for the campaign to drive the Iraqis from Kuwait,
although many in the U.S. Congress say that is far too little.
   Breaking ranks somewhat with other Western leaders, Kohl last
month proposed solving the Arab-Israeli conflicts and the Lebanese
civil war along with the Persian Gulf stalemate.
   In the closing days of the election campaign, he suggested
``regional security organizations'' to keep the peace in the Middle
East.
   Meanwhile, Germany's influence is likely to grow throughout
Eastern Europe as the new democracies there seek help in rebuilding
their own economies.
   And Germany is likely to stay at the forefront of international
support for the Soviet Union, for several reasons. Not the least is
the desire to prevent Soviets from going hungry and causing a tide
of refugees to head west.
   Germany already is a magnet for tens of thousands of foreign
refugees who sap the country's resources.
   The government plans to start sending many of the refugees to
the underdeveloped eastern part of the country, a move that could
make Germany less attractive to the newcomers.
   Along with his detente-minded Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher, the German chancellor also will be seeking abolition of
chemical weapons and further curbs on nuclear arms.
   Kohl told voters he will push even more for the decades-long
dream of a United States of Europe linking European Community
countries, predicting it could come about by the turn of the
century.
   At the same time, Kohl has promised to remain committed to
helping solve Third World economic woes. Germany, with 78 million
people, is Europe's No. 1 economic power.

<HEAD>Dollar Climbs Further, Stocks Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar gained against the Japanese yen for the
third consecutive trading day today, and Tokyo share prices closed
higher.
   The dollar closed at 133.00 yen, up 0.25 yen from Friday's
132.75 yen finish. It opened at 132.02 yen and ranged between
132.00 yen and 133.30 yen. Some $11.44 billion changed hands in
spot trading.
   The dollar now has gained 4.10 yen in the last three trading
days.
   ``There is little reason to buy the dollar now considering the
slowdown in the U.S. economy, but investors find less reason to buy
the yen,'' said Naohiko Yasuda, a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo.
   Dealers said the dollar's low start today was in reaction to
President Bush's proposal Friday for talks with Iraq.
   It quickly climbed again as investment trust firms bought
dollars to correct oversold positions since Friday, they added.
   The dollar shot up 2.60 yen Friday after the U.N. Security
Council adopted a resolution approving the use of military force to
drive Iraq out of Kuwait.
   The dollar tends to rise in times of international tension
because it is seen as a safe investment, while speculation of war
in the Persian Gulf usually weakens the yen because Japan imports
nearly all of its oil, and 70 percent comes from the Middle East.
   ``But the dollar failed to keep rising because of lingering
uncertainties over the Middle East,'' Yasuda said.
   He said the yen also weakened today against such major European
currencies as the German mark and British pound, mainly because of
the generally falling Tokyo stock market.
   On the stock exchange, the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average rose
271.36 points, or 1.21 percent, closing at 22,725.99. It lost
257.97 points Friday. Today's trading was thin, with first section
volume estimated at 250 million shares, down from Friday's 350
million.
   The index, which was up almost 480 points at the end of the
morning session, fell back as early optimism about the gulf crisis
soured and the yen weakened, traders said.
   ``Also, poor performances in the futures market kept investors
from arbitrage buying in the spot market,'' said Kazuhiro Nomura, a
dealer with New Japan Securities Co.
   Traders said the Nikkei's morning gains followed Friday's news
that Secretary of State James A. Baker III would be sent to Iraq
for high-level talks. They said optimism that a diplomatic solution
might be reached boosted buying.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds stood at 86.81 points, up from Friday's
86.31-point finish. Their yield fell to 7.315 percent from 7.425

   The winners held victory parties, the losers
post-mortems. Former East Germans held their breath, waiting for
the promises of four straight elections to be delivered.
   After what has seemed like a single, year-long campaign, voters
in what had until October been a Communist country joined Germans
to the west on Sunday and elected Chancellor Helmut Kohl to lead
the united nation.
   The election followed East Germany's first free elections in
March, its local elections in May, and state elections in October.
Kohl's Christian Democrats dominated each.
   Along the way, questions of ideology began to shrink into the
shadow of stark reality for many former East Germans.
   ``I care about my house. I care about my job, about clean air, a
playground for my children,'' Hiltrud Kluger, 36, said after voting
Sunday. ``I don't care about a market economy.''
   Sunday's balloting was the last of the nationwide races until
1994.
   The newly elected German Parliament, now free of the
hyperbole-filled rhetoric of successive campaigns, faces the task
of dispassionately fixing the broken eastern sector of the nation.
   Mrs. Kluger, a mother of two, lives in the depressed factory
town of Delitzsch, in the heart of the former nation's heavily
industrialized southern region.
   She would not say who she voted for, other than to say it was a
mainstream party. But her reasons for choosing a party were the
same as many other eastern Germans: to quickly improve the quality
of life.
   Eastern Germany is expected to face a sharp rise in joblessness
in the first quarter of next year. Many former Communist subsidies
that kept rents, energy costs and mass transit fees low will be
lifted on Jan. 1.
   But optimistic economic forecasts also predict new investment
that could begin creating new jobs in the middle of next year.
   Many eastern Germans believe Kohl's conservative, free
market-oriented party is best able to deliver that investment.
   Hildegard Neumann, 66, also a Delitzsch resident, voted for the
Christian Democrats in all four eastern elections.
   ``We think that the Christian Democrats are the capitalists,''
she said. ``They are also Christians, and we need that.''
   After World War II, Mrs. Neumann worked briefly for the U.S.
Army in West Germany as a telephone operator, but came back to the
East to be with family.
   She worked as a schoolteacher for 40 years and said she fought
efforts by authorities to get her to join the Communist Party.
   ``Once I was fired for three years because I said I believed in
God,'' she said. ``I stayed at home. Then they came back and said
they needed school teachers.''
   Despite the delicate financial condition of a pensioner in a
changing, depressed society, she said she is confident the
Christian Democrats will improve her living standards.
   ``I know we've had four elections, but it's very good indeed
that we can finally vote for the people we want in our
government,'' she said.
   Although Kohl's party buried the opposition, more than half of
the nation's voters on Sunday chose somebody else.
   Angelika Bobbe, a 35-year-old Berliner, supported Alliance 90, a
minor party that includes the intellectuals and pacifists who led
last year's revolt against Communism.
   She was laid off last summer from a government agency that
refurbished old buildings. She has been taking retraining courses
under a program paid for by Kohl's government.
   ``There is absolute chaos in this land,'' she said. ``Extremism,
greed. Joblessness was never a problem. People don't know how to
react.''
   The winners and losers knew how to react after the tentative
results were in. In Bonn, Kohl's supporters sipped German sparkling
wine and gulped chilled German beer. The triumphant chancellor sat
with his wife, Hannelore, on a large pedestal at the front of the
hall.
   At the headquarters of the opposition Social Democrats, solemn
organizers spoke about mounting a new charge in 1994.

   Aaron Copland, the immigrants' son from Brooklyn
who used jazz rhythms of the South, folk songs of Appalachia and
cowboy tunes of the prairie to create classical music that was
unmistakably American, has died at 90.
   The composer, who lived in Peekskill, died Sunday at Phelps
Memorial Hospital in North Tarrytown of pneumonia. He had suffered
two strokes recently.
   The ``dean of American music'' created such classics as
``Appalachian Spring,'' ``Rodeo,'' ``Billy the Kid'' and ``Lincoln
Portrait.'' Leonard Bernstein once called Copland's 1942 orchestral
composition ``Fanfare for the Common Man'' the ``all-time top of
the hit parade in American music.''
   The son of Eastern European immigrants, he strove to be more
American than most Americans and sought to focus the international
spotlight on his fellow American composers.
   ``He put American music on the map. He decided that there should
be an American sound, a place for the American composer,'' Vivian
Perlis, who collaborated with the composer on his 1984 memoir,
``Copland,'' said Sunday.
   Copland wrote two operas, six ballets and eight film scores,
including his Oscar-winning music for William Wyler's ``The
Heiress'' in 1948.
   He won a Pulitzer Prize in 1945 for the ballet ``Appalachian
Spring,'' based on a Shaker melody played by a clarinet. It was
choreographed by Martha Graham.
   His ballets ``Billy the Kid'' in 1938 and ``Rodeo'' in 1942 make
use of cowboy tunes and folk songs.
   Other works included the score for ``The Red Pony,'' the 1949
movie based on the novel by John Steinbeck, and ``Lincoln
Portrait,'' music performed with narration inspired by the writings
of Lincoln biographer Carl Sandburg.
   The Jewish boy from New York who learned to write
cowboy-inspired classical music didn't even travel to the West
until he was 28.
   ``I preferred to imagine being on a horse without actually
getting on one!'' he once said.
   William Schuman, who with Bernstein and Copland formed what
Schuman called a triumvirate of American composers, said, ``Copland
believed in the validity of American music, that we were not
inferior to our European cousins.''
   ``He created the American sound in symphonic music,'' said
Schuman.
   Both Bernstein and Copland ``wanted to incorporate popular music
into concert music. They always wanted the music to be in contact
with people,'' said composer Elliott Carter.
   Copland's storekeeper parents initially were reluctant to pay
for music lessons. ``My parents were of the opinion that enough
money had been invested in the musical training of the four older
children, with meager results,'' he recalled.
   But his persistence prevailed, and Copland eventually studied in
Paris with Nadia Boulanger and sold a composition, ``The Cat and
the Mouse,'' for $32.50.
   ``To finally see my music printed means more to me than any
debut in Carnegie Hall,'' he wrote home.
   In 1925, Boulanger, on organ, premiered ``Symphony for Organ and
Orchestra'' in New York as part of her U.S. debut.
   Afterward, Copland recalled, conductor Walter Damrosch addressed
the audience: ``Ladies and gentlemen, I am sure you will agree that
if a gifted young man can write a symphony like this at 23 ...
within five years he will be ready to commit murder.''
   With such jazz-inspired creations as ``Piano Concerto'' in 1926,
Copland once recalled, ``I felt I had gone to the extreme of where
jazz could take me, the audiences and critics in Boston all thought
I had gone too far.''
   During a trip to the West, Copland heard the piece being hissed
during rehearsal and again in concert at the Hollywood Bowl.
   But he forged on, experimenting with even more complex rhythms.
   ``Symphonic Ode,'' which premiered in 1932, was so difficult
conductor Serge Koussevitzky told Copland it took an hour to
rehearse three bars.
   Then, in 1936, Copland did a musical about-turn - to a simpler,
folk-based style in ``El Salon Mexico,'' inspired by a visit to
Mexico City. The work was followed in 1942 by ``Rodeo,'' which
launched Agnes DeMille's dancing career.
   Copland, who never married, is survived by several nieces and
nephews.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

   Leonard Bernstein's visit to Aaron Copland's
studio a half century ago opened the door on a friendship between
two composers who helped helped put American classical music on the
world map.
   On Sunday, Copland joined Bernstein in death.
   In life, they had created what a composer called ``the American
sound.''
   ``They were made for each other,'' said the Pulitzer
Prize-winning composer David Del Tredici. ``Aaron wrote the music,
and Lenny was its wonderful interpreter. Aaron was the Moses, and
Lenny was the Aaron.''
   William Schuman, who with Bernstein and Copland formed what
Schuman called a triumvirate of American composers, said, ``Copland
believed in the validity of American music, that we were not
inferior to our European cousins.''
   Copland and Bernstein first met when the young ``Lenny,'' in his
20s and fresh from Harvard, showed up at Copland's New York studio
door opposite Lincoln Center.
   ``Copland opened the door, Bernstein introduced himself and then
he just sat down and played `Variations,''' a work by Copland, said
Del Tredici, who claims Copland as his mentor.
   Del Tredici recalled weekends 20 years ago spent at Copland's
home near New York, which he described as ``a very `Copland' kind
of place, spacious, comfortable.''
   ``There was no vanity in him, he was very endearing,'' he said,
adding that Copland ``didn't care much about food, or a fancy
home.''
   ``He was generous to everyone around him and under him, and
uncomplicated,'' said Del Tredici. ``Usually geniuses are
self-centered, and I thought, `How can a man be a genius and still
be so nice?'''
   The down-to-earth approach translated into musical artistry that
drew on American folk tunes and jazz.
   ``Like most sons of immigrants, he wanted to be more American
than the Americans,'' said Del Tredici.
   At Copland's last birthday celebration two weeks ago, he ate
apple pie, which he preferred to cake. Surrounded by old friends,
Copland read messages from young people, from fifth-graders in
Arkansas to teen-agers in Arizona.
   ``He was not the least pretentious. If you didn't know he was
one of the greatest artists of the century, you would never suspect
it, with his wonderful, ruddy laugh,'' said Schuman.
   ``He had a uniquely American voice and was able to express in
his music particularly American sensibilities using substantially
the language of European serious music,'' said Kenneth Haas,
managing director of the Boston Symphony.
   Copland taught at the orchestra's Tanglewood music school in
Lenox, Mass., for 25 years and was head of the faculty there when
he stepped down in 1970.
   ``He lived a very productive 90 years,'' Haas said. ``Happily,
we will have his music to appreciate even though we don't have him
any more.''

   Nationalist officers seized army
headquarters and an infantry regiment early Monday and President
Carlos Menem immediately declared a state of seige, a presidential
spokesman said.
   Radio stations reported firefights in front of the seized
Patricios Infantry Regiment in Palermo, on the eastern side of the
capital. They said loyal officers were battling to retake the
building.
   The uprising occurred just two days before the planned arrival
of President Bush on his South American tour.
   The presidential spokesman, Humberto Toledo, said information
linked the mutineers to Col. Mohammed Ali Seineldin, who was
cashiered and jailed after leading a failed military uprising in
December 1988.
   Toledo said Menem was in his office in the Government Palace,
two blocks from army headquarters, which was captured by a group of
about 50 officers.
   The officers, their faces covered in war paint, raided the
building around 4 a.m. (2 a.m. EST) and told journalists the attack
was ``to fulfill the fourth stage of Operation Dignity,'' a
movement of nationalist officers opposed to the government's
prosecution of officers for human rights abuses.
   An army communique said the situation in the rest of the country
``is normal.''
   ``The four army corps are still under the control of their
commanders, except for small outbreaks that are being controlled,''
said the communique, signed by Gen. Martin Bonnet, the military
chief of staff, who remained loyal to Menem.
   It was the first military uprising under the government of
Menem, who took office in July. Three previous uprisings occurred
in 1987 and 1988 under President Raul Alfonsin.
   Bush arrived at dawn Monday in the Brazilian capital of Brasilia
and was proceeding to talks with President Fernando Collor de Mello
and a speech to a joint session of the Brazilian Congress.
   He was to fly to Buenos Aires on Wednesday.

   Few people recognized Calvin Klein as he quietly
re-hung dresses during a sale of $4 million in merchandise donated
by fashion designers to benefit the fight against AIDS.
   The clothes donated by Klein and more than 100 other U.S.
designers brought in more than $3.5 million by the end of the
three-day sale Sunday and surpassed the goal of $1 million.
   In an industry where huge egos are legendary, what stood out was
that the fashion leaders were able to put their rivalry aside and
work together on a cause close to many in the clothing business.
Many in the fashion industry - including Perry Ellis - have died of
AIDS.
   ``With a hundred diverse souls like this, it's a miracle,'' said
one organizer.
   ``I think I can see something clicking with the shoppers as they
see us, our camaraderie, and see this - what the industry has
wanted to do together for a long time,'' said Patricia Underwood, a
hat designer who's had her own label for 14 years. ``I think AIDS
is starting to mean something to them.''
   For many designers, it was the first time in years they had been
face-to-face with the public. Most of them stood by unnoticed as
shoppers hunted down designer merchandise at huge discounts.
   ``That's definitely a 39-long,'' designer Jeffrey Banks told a
shopper who held up a shirt to her husband's back.
   Marc Jacobs, the Perry Ellis designer, helped tear open a carton
of sweaters as the crowd ignored him and looked at a mannequin
instead.
   Nevi Sicetola, 22, who bought a pair of jeans and a cashmere
sweater, said the sale was ``chaos.'' But she added, ``It's a very
good cause.''
   A spokesman for the Council of Fashion Designers of America,
which sponsored the event with Vogue magazine, said the money will
be distributed by the New York City AIDS Fund, which gives grants
to AIDS-related causes.
   Socialite Blaine Trump, wearing a baseball jacket with a logo
for an AIDS support group, looked for Christmas presents. William
F. Buckley's wife, Pat, came back for a second day. New York Daily
News gossip columnist Liz Smith sifted through sports shirts.
   Men's designer shirts that normally sell from $80 to $200 went
for $25 and sweaters selling anywhere from $150 to $500 were $50.
Norma Kamali socks were selling two pair for $1. Dresses that
normally go for thousands of dollars were half-price.
   The spirit of cooperation even seemed to infect the shoppers,
who had to buy $10 tickets in advance to get in. Groups of 1,500
waited happily for an hour before being let in for their 2{-hour
shop-a-thon. Shoppers were let in in shifts to control crowding and
to give designers a chance to restock their tables.
   The event was staffed by volunteers - some of whom have AIDS -
ranging from retailers and backroom assistants to fashion students.
   Klein even seemed to think the event could be repeated
elsewhere.
   ``I don't see why it couldn't happen in Paris, London or
Milan,'' he said.

<HEAD>Hospital Offers Free Tests to Patients of Doctor Who Died of AIDS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dozens of people called Johns Hopkins Hospital
in response to its offer to test for AIDS about 1,800 patients who
were operated on by a surgeon who died of the disease.
   The hospital said it would send a letter this week to all
patients Dr. Rudolph Almaraz had operated on since joining its
staff in 1984. The breast cancer specialist died Nov. 16 at age 41
of what his family's lawyer, Marvin Ellin, said was AIDS.
   Ellin said the letter will generate ``nothing but panic'' among
Almaraz's former patients. ``Every ache and every pain they
experience is going to cause them to wonder if they have AIDS,'' he
said.
   The hospital received dozens of calls Sunday as a result of a
story in The Sun in which Ellin said Almarez had died of AIDS.
Documents that would confirm his illness, including the death
certificate, are confidential under Maryland law.
   Johns Hopkins said in its letter that the possibility that the
AIDS virus was transmitted to any person during surgery is remote.
   Ellin said Almaraz told him he was exposed to AIDS when blood
from an AIDS patient squirted into his eyes and mouth during an
operation in New York about seven years ago.
   Suzanne Raussenbert, a spokeswoman for Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center in New York where Almaraz was on a fellowship, on
Sunday said the hospital had no records that would indicate Almaraz
contracted AIDS there. He practiced at the hospital in 1983.
   Almaraz also had privileges at Children's Hospital, where a
spokeswoman said Almarza never operated, and Homewood Hospital
South. Homewood spokesman Larry Wilson said the hospital will
consider sending letters to the surgeon's patients.
   Almaraz was surgeon-in-chief of surgical oncology and
endocrinology at Hopkins until 1985, when he started his private
practice. Almaraz sold his practice March 1 and resigned from the
Johns Hopkins staff June 30.
   Dr. Timothy Townsend, senior director for medical affairs at
Johns Hopkins, said the hospital made repeated efforts, starting in
late summer, to determine the nature of Almaraz's illness amid
rumors that he had AIDS.
   While Johns Hopkins could not give the exact number of patients
Almaraz operated on, Townsend estimated the figure at 300 a year.
At that rate, he could have operated on more than 1,800 patients
while on the staff.
   AIDS most commonly is transmitted through sexual contact or the
sharing of needles by intravenous drug users or exposure to tainted
blood or other bodily fluids.
   Dr. Gregory B. Bulkley, a professor of surgery at the Hopkins
Medical School, said a study has found that a doctor who pricks
himself while operating on a person with AIDS has a 0.2 percent
chance of picking up the virus.
   The risk of a doctor transmitting AIDS to a patient is so small
as to be immeasurable, he said.
   There is only one case in which a patient is believed to have
contracted the disease from a health-care provider.
   In that case, David J. Acer, was a Stuart, Fla., dentist, who
died of AIDS on Sept. 3. Nine months earlier, one of his patients,
Kimberly Bergalis, 22, was told she had AIDS after being
hospitalized for a form of pneumonia.

<HEAD>Report: Radiation Danger Found in Oil Fields</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Decades of oil drilling have brought so much
radium to the surface that radioactive contamination in oil fields
sometimes exceeds by five to 30 times the level permitted at
nuclear plants, The New York Times said today.
   The newspaper said environmental officials have found radium, a
naturally occurring radioactive material, in every oil-producing
region in the country from Alaska to the Gulf states.
   They found low levels of radiation in pumps, pipes and storage
tanks from radium that leaches from mineral deposits into water
that comes to the surface with oil, the Times said.
   The federal government has no regulations to deal with oil field
radiation, the paper said.
   The extent of the health risk to oil workers who handle drilling
equipment contaminated by radium or to people exposed to
radium-contaminated water and soil is unknown. But health officials
worry that exposure may raise the risk of cancer and other
illnesses, the Times said.
   Oil industry representatives say the risk is minimal or
nonexistent, the paper said.
   The contamination is worst in the South and along the Gulf Coast
where radium concentrations in the water are much higher than in
other regions.
   Oil companies for years in the South have routinely poured
billions of gallons of contaminated water into thousands of unlined
ponds before pumping it back into the ground or releasing it into
wetlands, the Times said.

   Japan's first space voyage has generated pride
along with broadsides about the blatant commercialism of the
venture, which cost the nation's largest private broadcasting
company $37 million.
   Toyohiro Akiyama, the first Japanese and first journalist in
space, was orbiting the Earth today with two Soviet cosmonauts in a
Soyuz space capsule, a day after their blast-off from the steppes
of Soviet Central Asia.
   The rocket carrying Akyiyama into space was plastered with the
logos of nine Japanese corporate sponsors, including a manufacturer
of diapers and sanitary products, a toothpaste company and a solar
heater maker.
   Japanese newspapers praised the mission, but gently prodded
Tokyo Broadcasting System, which footed the bill, for
commercializing the final frontier.
   Asahi Shimbun, Japan's largest newspaper and linked to a media
group in competition with TBS, described the mission as an
advertising ``sales blitz.''
   ``This flight is supposed to be a practice for allowing other
laymen into space, but it also gives the impression that space
travel is a business,'' said Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a major economic
newspaper.
   TBS is spending $37 million to launch Akiyama, 48, and broadcast
his coverage live for the duration of the eight-day trip.
   The network hopes to arrange a telephone call Dec. 7 between
Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and the cosmonauts.
   The commercial contract with TBS boosted the Kremlin's drive to
cash in on its Soyuz space program in the face of critical economic
problems.
   Cosmonauts Viktor Afanasyev and Musa Manarov will link the Soyuz
capsule with the space station Mir. They will switch places with
cosmonauts Gennady Manakov and Gennady Strekalov and spend the next
six months orbiting the earth.
   Soviet officials and TBS executives have held out the hope that
the flight could improve ties between the two countries, which
never officially ended their World War II hostilities.
   Japanese newspapers also focused on the human-interest aspects
of the flight, the first layman's venture into space since New
Hampshire schoolteacher Christa McAufiffe and six astronauts died
in the 1986 Challenger explosion.
   ``A regular guy becomes a middle-aged star,'' trumpeted the
Sankei Shimbun.
   ``Prayer, smiles and then tears,'' it said of Akiyama's wife,
Kyoko, who watched her husband disappear into space from the
Baikonur Cosmodrome, 1,310 miles east of Moscow.
   Kyoko called the blastoff ``beautiful,'' although she earlier
said she was nervous.
   ``But when I saw their faces on the television screen, I calmed
down and felt happier,'' she said.
   Akiyama is to spend six days aboard Mir. In addition to his live
reporting he will carry out experiments to seek how tree frogs
react to a gravity-free environment.

   Robert Hearin paid almost a million
dollars hoping to ransom his wife of 50 years. But her kidnappers
were unyielding and the 73-year-old multimillionaire died without
ever seeing her again.
   Hearin's heart gave out Wednesday, two years after Annie Laurie
Hearin was kidnapped from their Mississippi home.
   Hearin, one of the state's most powerful and wealthy men, paid
$931,000 in ransom, but his wife was never freed. Authorities
believe she is dead.
   ``My one regret is I couldn't give him back his wife,'' said FBI
agent Wayne R. Taylor. ``We continue to do everything we can that
might lead to her.''
   The Hearins met while they were students at the University of
Alabama and married in 1940. They had two children, Robert Hearin
Jr., a lawyer in New Orleans, and Laurie McRee of Jackson.
   ``We've had a terrible loss. I think all along there has been a
real mix of sadness and anger,'' said the son.
   Hearin was worth an estimated $200 million. He controlled
Mississippi's largest gas distribution company, Mississippi Valley
Gas Co.; its second-largest bank, Trustmark National Bank, and its
second-largest insurance company, Lamar Life Corp.
   Hearin avoided the news media after his wife was kidnapped, but
did appear on the TV show ``Unsolved Mysteries.'' He never gave up
hope of finding his wife, although authorities believe she died
long ago. Last year, he moved out of the brick Georgian house they
shared.
   ``I'm pretty sure she was dead within the first month. I am
absolutely sure she is dead,'' said Dr. Rodrigo Galvez, a Jackson
psychiatrist and pathologist who analyzed the ransom note.
   Mrs. Hearin, 72 when she was kidnapped, suffered from ileitis, a
chronic intestinal disease that could cause death in days without
daily medication.
   About three weeks after she was kidnapped, her husband received
a letter in her handwriting urging him to pay off 12 disgruntled
investors named in a rambling letter left in the house the day she
disappeared.
   FBI officials said Hearin paid a total of $931,000. Those named
were investors in a school picture company of which Hearin was the
largest shareholder. Among them was Newton Alfred Winn, a St.
Petersburg, Fla., lawyer.
   He was sentenced in February to 19 years in prison for
conspiring to kidnap Mrs. Hearin, mailing a threatening
communication and lying to a federal grand jury.
   No one was ever charged with the actual kidnapping.
   The younger Hearin said he and his sister hold out hope their
mother will return, but ``the passage of time leads one not to be
optimistic.''

<HEAD>Major Winter Storm in Midwest, Great Lakes Region</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A major winter storm hit the upper Midwest and Great Lakes
region early today, and rain fell ahead of a cold front in the
eastern third of the nation.
   A winter storm warning was posted for today in Michigan,
Illinois and Wisconsin. Southern Wisconsin was expected to get up
to a foot of snow in spots.
   Freezing rain fell in Illinois today, and sleet and rain were
expected to leave roads slick across many areas of the Midwest.
   Snow fell early today in North Dakota, Minnesota, Nebraska, Iowa
and Kansas. Snow also fell in the Great Lakes region at Detroit and
Cleveland.
   Rain fell today in the Ohio Valley, Pennsyvania, Tennessee and
Kentucky. Rain also fell in southern Florida and thunderstorms hit
New Orleans.
   The cold front extended from just south of Chicago in a slight
curve to just west of New Orleans.
   The weather was expected to be mild and humid ahead of the
front. Thunderstorms were expected to develop in the wake of the
front, which was likely to dump up to 2 inches of rain in places.
   The high temperature for the nation on Sunday was 89 degrees at
Harlingen, Texas.

   Two Daily News replacement drivers were charged
with possessing a loaded, unlicensed gun, a pipe bomb was found
near the paper's Brooklyn plant and a striker was charged with
assaulting a News hawker.
   Meanwhile, Publisher James Hoge, fearing a fight over subway
newspaper sales today, said the Metropolitan Transit Authority
should seek an injunction if transit workers threaten to walk out
in solidarity with Daily News strikers.
   A 6-inch pipe bomb was found Sunday on a ramp leading to a truck
parking area at the News' Brooklyn printing plant, police said.
Nearby were two unexploded, M-80 firecrackers taped to boxes of
nails, authorities said.
   Police had gone there to investigate 12 explosions, apparently
caused by firecrackers, said Sgt. Tina Mohrmann.
   The News said about 200 strikers threw cherry bombs and M-80
firecrackers.
   Sgt. Peter Sweeney, another police spokesman, said one man was
arrested for throwing a bottle that hit an officer. In addition,
four demonstrators were arrested for disorderly conduct, he said.
   In a separate incident, two News replacement drivers were
charged with weapons possession after a loaded .25-caliber handgun
was found in the front seat of their truck early Sunday, police
said.
   Also on Sunday, a striking News pressman was charged in the
assault of a Daily News hawker.
   Hoge sent MTA chief Robert Kiley a letter Saturday saying that
it is illegal for transit workers to strike.
   The letter followed a temporary court order issued Friday that
allows hawkers to sell the Daily News in train and subway stations
as long as they stay within 10 feet of newsstands or vending boxes
that don't carry the News.
   Strikers have said they would picket the hawkers and some
transit workers have indicated they would not cross picket lines to
go to work.
   Newspaper management turned to hawkers after many newstands
refused to sell the News.
   John Cunningham, an MTA spokesman, declined to comment on Hoge's
letter.
   The strike by some 2,100 workers began Oct. 25.

   The dollar fell against major foreign currencies
today in early European trading. Gold prices were lower.
   Dealers said the market's main preoccupation continues to be
U.S. moves to get Iraqi occupation forces to leave Kuwait.
   A new U.S. diplomatic effort could reduce the risk of war
slightly, traders said, but they added that the tense situation in
the Gulf continues to prop up the dollar.
   The dollar is considered a safe haven currency in crisis
situations.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.25 yen to a closing 133.00 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at a higher rate of 134.12 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with Friday:
   -1.5035 German marks, up from 1.4990
   -1.2870 Swiss francs, up from 1.2760
   -5.0810 French francs, up from 5.0630

   -1,130.25 Italian lire, up from 1,122.00
   -1.1648 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1640
   In London, the British pound was quoted at a lower rate of
$1.9315, compared with $1.9400 Friday.
   London's major bullion dealers fixed a recommended gold price of
$381.75 per ounce at midmorning, down from $382.25 bid per ounce
late Friday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $381.75, down from $385.00 late
Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 4.95 to close at a bid 380.06.
   Silver traded in London at a bid price of $4.14 a troy ounce, up
from Friday's $4.11.

   Dozens of schools along the New Madrid
Fault canceled classes today just in case the earth rumbles as
forecast. And farm animals will decide whether classes should be
held in one Illinois county.
   Judy Byrd of Evansville, Ind., gave in to her 11-year-old son's
request to stay home even though she doesn't believe earthquakes
can be forecast.
   ``At this age, they really worry about everything. War. An
earthquake. Water. The environment,'' Mrs. Byrd said. ``I figured
if he really was that worried about it, it should be up to him.''
   The nervousness was prompted by New Mexico climatologist Iben
Browning's forecast of a 50-50 chance for a major earthquake along
the fault this week.
   Schools were closed today and Tuesday in more than a dozen
districts in Arkansas and Missouri. Classes were also canceled in
at least three districts in Tennessee and several in Kentucky and
Illinois.
   Residents of Illinois' St. Clair County were watching cats and
dogs as well as farm animals for signs of nervousness, and had
considered canceling school today if there seemed to be a problem.
But schoolchildren had their hopes of a day off dashed this
morning.
   ``We have a special monitoring committee that's been watching
the animals,'' said Bill Gullick, superintendent of Marissa
Community Unit School District 40. ``One of the people on the
committee is a farmer. He was the last person we checked with early
this morning, and everything was OK.''
   Gullick said many people claim animals seem to sense
earthquakes, and the method has been used in China for more than
1,000 years.
   In Marked Tree, dozens of people in the community of 3,200 left
town just in case. Not Sterling Ivy.
   ``I wouldn't go two steps to try to get away from an earthquake,
because if your time comes, you're going to go,'' Ivy said outside
St. John Missionary Baptist Church in Marked Tree.
   Marked Tree lies at the southern end of the New Madrid Fault,
which runs northeast through New Madrid, Mo., up to Cairo, Ill.
   Browning bases his theory on the gravitational pull of the sun
and moon, which he says will be particularly strong during the
48-hour period on either side of Sunday. Many scientists say that
the theory is nonsense and that no one can predict earthquakes
accurately.
   In New Madrid, many residents watched the media circus on Main
Street.
   ``I knew there would be a lot of press here, but I never had a
clue it would be like this. It's just amazing,'' said Virginia
Carlson, director of the New Madrid Historical Museum, where
reporters, photographers and the curious traipsed in and out.
   Outside the museum, which documents huge earthquakes along the
fault in 1811 and 1812, onlookers took pictures of photographers
taking pictures of them. Traffic crawled through jam-packed
streets.
   Many people bought T-shirts with the slogans ``It's Our Fault,''
and ``The Biggest Earthquake that Never Happened.''
   ``The third biggest industry in town is picking up aluminum cans
alongside the road,'' said Leland Phillips. ``But now the T-shirt
business has zoomed by the can business.''
   In Memphis, Tenn., 40 miles southeast of Marked Tree, earthuake
awareness was also high.
   ``I had one guy call and ask if Monday's earthquake had been
canceled,'' said Judy Drawdy of the Memphis-Shelby County Emergency
Management Agency. ``Like this Iben Browning had called off the
earthquake. I thought that was rather humorous.''
   The Center for Earthquake Information and Research at Memphis
recorded a small quake in Arkansas on Sunday, but it was not along
the New Madrid Fault and caused no reported damage. The temblor,
measuring 2.0 on the Richter scale, was centered in the Ozark
Mountains, director Arch Johnston said.
   He said dozens of people called the center, including one woman
who said she planned to wear a hard hat to bed.
   Retailers said items such as bottled water, first aid supplies,
flashlights, batteries, radios, sleeping bags, blankets and tents
sold briskly.
   Arkansas officials took advantage of the earthquake concerns to
hold a drill using a worst-case scenario: an earthquake measuring a
catastrophic 7.6 on the Richter scale occurring Friday afternoon
along the fault.
   By Sunday, officials said the imaginary toll in a 17-county area
of the state had reached 4,950 dead, 25,097 seriously injured and
98,020 homeless.

   Today's 17th game of the Garry
Kasparov-Anatoly Karpov world chess championship has been postponed
until Wednesday at Kasparov's request.
   The two Soviet grandmasters are scheduled to resume the 16th
game on Tuesday. That game was contested for five hours Saturday
and nearly six hours Sunday without a result after 88 moves.
   Through the 15 completed games, the players are tied with 7.5
points each.
   They have had three draws in the French portion of the
championship. They had 10 draws in the 12 games played at New York
between Oct. 8 and Nov. 7.
   The first player to reach 12.5 points wins the championship, but
Kasparov would retain the title in the event of a 12-12 draw.
   Each player is allowed to request up to three postponements
during the championship. The postponement requested by Kasparov
today was his second. Karpov has used one timeout.

<HEAD>Judge Investigates Contracts for Pope Visit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge is investigating whether corruption was
involved in the awarding of contracts for Pope John Paul II's visit
to Naples last month, newspapers reported.
   Assistant prosecutor, Oberdan Forlenza, opened the probe on
Tuesday.
   An opposition leader in Naples, Amedeo Laboccetta, has charged
the city government wasted money on the construction of altars and
platforms for papal ceremonies. He criticized the city for awarding
the contract for a large platform in downtown Naples to a company
in northern Italy, instead of a local business. Laboccetta also
assailed the lack of open bidding on the project.
   ``A lot of money was wasted to let who-knows-who earn a few
million (lire), profiting ignobly from a papal visit,'' he said,
according to a report Wednesday in the Milan-based Corriere della
Sera.
   The head of the city economic office, Diego Tesorone, was quoted
as saying he awarded the contract without bidding because it was
urgent. He said he chose a company outside Naples to avoid
involving the Camorra, the Neapolitan Mafia, which traditionally is
influential in local construction.
   ``The Camorra was trying to infiltrate itself in the operation
and I, choosing a company that had worked on other papal trips,
ruined their intervention,'' Tesorone told Corriere della Sera.
   Labocetta also charged that the city had rented hundreds of
plastic chairs for a papal Mass, paying $4 for each one, when they
could have been purchased for $1 less. Hundreds were reported
stolen before a papal Mass.
   The city government spent $1.4 million to build structures and
rent chairs for the papal visit Nov. 9-11, the reports said. The
pontiff visited neighboring towns Nov. 12-13.
   The five-day trip was his longest papal journey in Italy and was
seen as a symbol of the Vatican's faith in the region, despite all
its troubles.
   Italian government leaders bluntly acknowledge that they have
lost control of large segments of the country's southern regions to
Mafia clans.

   The United States will use its
nearly 600 million barrel petroleum reserves to stabilize oil
prices in the event of war in the Persian Gulf, a U.S. Embassy
official said today.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, commented
after U.S. Energy Secretary James Watkins met Sunday with his Saudi
Arabian counterpart, Hisham Nazer.
   Watkins arrived Saturday for talks on the oil market situation
in light of Iraq's 4-month-long occupation of Kuwait. Saudi Arabia
controls more than a quarter of the world's known oil reserves. By
overtaking Kuwait, Iraq increased its share of the world's oil
reserves to 20 percent.
   Saudi official statements only mentioned that the two men
discussed the world oil market and means of stabilizing it as well
as bilateral cooperation in the oil industry. No details were
given.
   The U.S. Embassy official said that Watkins and Nazer talked
about the effect of the Persian Gulf crisis on the world oil
market, as well as U.S.-Saudi relations.
   ``They discussed U.S. plans to use strategic petroleum reserves
in case hostilities broke out and a real shortage emerged,'' said
the diplomat. ``People tend to panic when a conflict breaks out,
but we'll do whatever we can to maintain stability.''
   The United States, Germany, and Japan together have about 1
billion barrels of oil in reserve. Saudi Arabia's reserves stand at
approximately 260 billion barrels. Two months ago, President Bush
said the United States would sell 5 million barrels of the 590
million stored in 65 salt-dome caverns in Texas and Louisiana in an
attempt to stabilize prices.
   Before heading to the United Arab Emirates today, Watkins
visited Saudi Aramco, the world's largest oil-producing company.
   Informed sources said on Sunday that discussions by Watkins and
Nazer included expansion of Saudi Aramco, an oil contingency plan
in case of war, and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries.
   Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, has played a
prominent role in almost doubling its oil output to meet the
shortage on the world market precipitated by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion
of Kuwait.
   The move, along with additional production by other OPEC
members, have helped stabilize oil prices. They doubled to around
$40 a barrel at one point, and now are about $30 dollars per
barrel. War could push oil prices as high as $100 per barrel,
according to some estimates.

   Bombs exploded in a Mormon chapel and in
the offices of two right-wing political parties, causing minor
damage and no injuries, police said today. Authorities blamed a
small radical leftist guerrilla group.
   An anonymous caller told a news agency that the blasts Sunday
were ``an offensive'' to protest a visit by President Bush. Bush
began a five-nation South American tour in Brasil today, and is
scheduled to arrive here Thursday.
   Police said the bomb at a Mormon chapel in Conchali, a northern
Santiago working-class suburb shattered windows.
   Similar attacks occurred at the offices of two right-wing
political parties in La Florida and San Miguel, two working-class
districts south of the capital city. Police said the attackers were
members of the Lautaro Front.

<TEXT>
   Four Omaha, Neb., automobile dealerships
seeking to escape lawsuits charging them with violating Iowa's
consumer fraud laws lost a Supreme Court appeal today.
   The justices, without comment, left intact an Iowa Supreme Court
ruling that forces the dealerships to defend themselves in Iowa
courts.
   The dealerships had argued that Iowa's courts have no authority
over them.
   Iowa's highest court said such authority stems from the
dealerships' placing newspaper advertisements in the Omaha
World-Herald, which is circulated in Iowa.
   The state court noted that the dealerships also placed ads in a
telephone directory for Council Bluffs, Iowa, which is located just
across the Missouri River from Omaha.
   The lawsuits, filed in 1987 by Iowa Attorney General Thomas J.
Miller, allege that the ads placed by the dealerships - Baxter
Chrysler Plymouth, Markel Ford, John Kraft Chevrolet-Isuzu and
Olsen Auto World - were false and misleading.
   The suits seek a halt to such advertising practices, and
restitution for any Iowa residents who lost money because of the
challenged ads.
   A fifth suit had been filed against Dean Rawson Nisson of Omaha,
but that dealership entered into a consent agreement with Iowa
officials.
   The Constitution's due-process protections, as interpreted in a
series of past rulings by the nation's highest court, bar a state
court from hearing any lawsuit filed against non-residents unless
they have ``certain minimum contacts'' with that state.
   The Iowa Supreme Court ruled last May that the car dealerships'
advertising efforts ``are sufficient to render them amenable to
suit here in an action which seeks to halt that advertising on the
ground that it is unlawful.''
   The state court added that the ads also make the dealerships
vulnerable to those portions of the lawsuits seeking other
sanctions.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the dealerships argued
that the May ruling went far beyond established boundaries of state
court authority.
   ``This case is an attempt by the Iowa attorney general to impose
Iowa law against Nebraska retailers who advertise their product in
a Nebraska newspaper, which ads comply with both Nebraska and
federal law,'' the appeal contended.
   The case is Baxter Chrysler Plymouth vs. Iowa, 90-583.

<TEXT>
   Ireland's first woman president, Mary
Robinson, was inaugurated today at Dublin Castle, and she extended
a hand of friendship to both Protestants and Catholics in
strife-ridden Northern Ireland.
   ``I will seek to encourage mutual understanding and tolerance
between all the different communities sharing this island,'' Mrs.
Robinson said in her acceptance speech, delivered in English and
Gaelic.
   A 21-gun salute echoed across the Irish capital as Mrs. Robinson
was sworn in by Chief Justice Thomas Finlay, following an
interdenominational service at the medieval, turreted castle.
   About 500 church and state dignitaries and Dublin-based foreign
diplomats looked on as Mrs. Robinson, wearing a purple jacket, took
the oath of office.
   Schools throughout the republic were given the day off to watch
the ceremony televised live in Britain and in the Irish Republic,
where Ireland's tricolor flags flew against cloudy skies.
   The president, a 46-year-old feminist lawyer, campaigned for the
largely ceremonial post on a liberal platform of change and a more
involved presidency. She won the Nov. 9 election with 52.8 percent
of the vote.
   She invited Irish descendants around the world to visit their
native island.
   Mrs. Robinson said she would continue Ireland's long tradition
of promoting international human rights, particularly in Latin
America and Africa, during her seven-year term in office.
   After her victory, Mrs. Robinson thanked the women of Ireland
who voted for her and ``instead of rocking the cradle, rocked the
system.''
   The president and mother of three children aged 9 to 18
addressed Irish women in her acceptance speech.
   ``As a woman I want women who have felt themselves outside
history to be written back into history ... finding a voice where
they have found a vision.''
   In 20 years in the Irish senate and as a lawyer, Mrs. Robinson
battled church and state in efforts to legalize divorce and
contraception.
   She won court cases to permit women to serve on juries, to
overturn laws criminalizing homosexuality, to restore inheritance
rights for illegitimate children and to give women legislators the
same pension rights as their male colleagues.
   Mrs. Robinson succeeds Patrick Hillery, who is stepping down
after the maximum 14 years in office.

   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. moved to
become a major player in the computer industry by offering $6
billion for the NCR Corp., the nation's fifth-largest computer
maker.
   NCR chairman Charles E. Exley Jr. reacted negatively to the
offer of $90 worth of AT&amp;T stock for each share of NCR and
criticized AT&amp;T for making the takeover discussions public Sunday.
   In early trading today, NCR shares shot up $24.75 to $81.50
after a delayed opening on the New York Stock Exchange. AT&amp;T shares
fell $2.25 to $29.87{ in heavy trading.
   AT&amp;T chairman Robert E. Allen said AT&amp;T decided to go public so
NCR stockholders could make their own decisions. NCR, formerly
National Cash Register, rejected a bid valued at $85 per share as
too low on Friday.
   An AT&amp;T-NCR merger would be the second-largest takeover of 1990
after Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.'s $6.13 billion merger
with MCA Inc., which was announced last week. It would represent
AT&amp;T's largest-ever acquisition.
   The merger would greatly increase the presence of the
long-distance phone service giant and telecommunications equipment
maker in the computer industry, which it entered six years ago with
the breakup of the Bell System.
   Some observers had long predicted AT&amp;T, which has made alliances
with and acquired other hardware and software makers in recent
years, would become one of the major computer makers.
   NCR also is a leading maker of automated teller machines and
cash registers.
   AT&amp;T said the two companies and their boards have exchanged
letters and presentations on the proposed acquisition but that
talks had broken down.
   ``Although AT&amp;T said it is willing to negotiate all aspects of
its proposal, including price, NCR has since repeatedly refused to
meet with either AT&amp;T or its advisers,'' AT&amp;T said.
   AT&amp;T said its $90 offer amounted to 88 percent more than the $48
NCR stock traded for on Nov. 7, the day before reports of a rumored
AT&amp;T bid surfaced in the media.
   But Exley said the $90 offer was only 25 percent more than the
highest price his company's stock had reached in the past six
months. NCR stock traded for $56.75 Friday on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   In a statement Sunday night, Exley said AT&amp;T cannot hope to
achieve the merger ``without the support and confidence of NCR
management in AT&amp;T's integrity and sense of honor.''
   ``No ultimatum or demand will likely win that support or
confidence. And no ultimatum or demand will intimidate the board of
directors of NCR into doing a disservice to the company, its
customers, shareholders and employees,'' he said.
   AT&amp;T said its offer would remain open until the end of business
Wednesday.
   It said its purchase of NCR would be particularly beneficial in
selling computers and other equipment to industries such as
retailing and banking, where NCR has its strength. AT&amp;T said such
uses of computers require extensive communications know-how that
the company can provide.
   Under a merger, AT&amp;T's computer line would be combined with
NCR's, and NCR would continue to operate under its own name from
its Dayton, Ohio, headquarters, AT&amp;T said. AT&amp;T said that it did
not expect to close any NCR facilities and that it wanted NCR's
management to run the combined operation.
   NCR, which has about 56,000 employees, announced in September it
will replace its proprietary computers with so-called open systems,
which adhere to computer-industry standards and can work easily
with models made by other companies.
   NCR earned $412 million on overall revenue of $5.96 billion last
year.
   AT&amp;T, with about 279,000 employees, earned $2.7 billion on
overall revenue of $36 billion last year.

<HEAD>Court Shields Businesses from Some Suits in Pension Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today shielded businesses
from some big-money lawsuits filed by employees who claim they were
fired so their employers would not have to pay pension benefits.
   The court ruled unanimously that fired employees may not sue in
state courts over such allegations. The state suits are pre-empted
by a federal law protecting pensions, the court said.
   The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 is aimed at
assuring workers will get their retirement pay. But state lawsuits
had loomed as potentially far more lucrative because fired
employees could win punitive damages that greatly exceed lost pay.
   Writing for the court today in a case from Texas, Justice Sandra
Day O'Connor said Congress clearly intended to preclude state
lawsuits over firings motivated by efforts to avoid paying pension
benefits.
   ``The goal was to minimize the administrative and financial
burden of complying with conflicting directives among states or
between states and the federal government,'' O'Connor said.
   The decision is a victory for the Ingersoll-Rand Co., which was
sued by Perry McClendon after firing him in 1982.
   McClendon had been transferred by the company from San Antonio
to Dallas in 1979 to develop a sales market for construction
equipment there. He was fired four months before his 10th
anniversary with the company.
   A worker with 10 years experience is entitled to have his
pension vested, which meant Ingersoll-Rand would have to contribute
to McClendon's retirement benefits.
   McClendon sued in Texas state courts, accusing his former
employer of firing him to avoid paying pension benefits. The
company said he was fired to reduce the workforce and save money.
   McClendon did not sue for lost pension benefits. In fact,
shortly after he sued the company agreed to vest his pension.
Instead, McClendon's suit sought a potentially big-money judgment
for lost wages, mental anguish and punitive damages.
   The Texas Supreme Court ruled that McClendon's lawsuit was not
precluded by ERISA, the federal law, but today's decision reversed
the state court ruling.
   The case is Ingersoll-Rand vs. McClendon, 89-1298.

<HEAD>Ruling Stands On Arizona Air Pollution Controls</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS 4th graf, The deadline, to show extension not yet
expired.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today left intact a ruling
that gave federal officials a deadline for approving tougher air
pollution controls for two metropolitan areas in Arizona.
   The justices, without comment, rejected Bush administration
arguments that a federal appeals court ruling improperly limited
the government's power in developing plans for improving regional
air quality.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last May gave the
Environmental Protection Agency six months to adopt a new plan for
reducing carbon monxide in Phoenix and Tucson and surrounding
areas in Maricopa and Pima counties, respectively.
   The deadline was to expire Nov. 26, but federal officials were
granted a two-month extension.
   Justice Department lawyers said the appeals court exceeded its
authority and may be in conflict with a Supreme Court ruling issued
last June.
   In that decision, the justices reinforced the EPA's power to
seek fines against air polluters even when federal officials have
been slow to approve plans for cleaning up the atmosphere. The June
decision permitted EPA enforcement when the agency arguably has
missed its own deadlines for adopting new rules.
   The appeal acted on today said the Arizona case should be
restudied in light of that ruling. But state residents seeking
stricter pollution controls said the June decision is irrelevant to
the case.
   The residents sued the EPA, claiming pollution control plans it
approved for the two metropolitan areas are inadequate.
   The agency required gas stations to sell high oxygen content
fuel during winter months when carbon monoxide levels are highest;
large employers to limit commuting by employees driving to work
alone; and upgraded testing of car-exhaust emissions.
   The plans' challengers said additional measures are needed,
including expanded mass transit, parking controls, bus and car pool
lanes, reduced bus fares and reduced truck travel during peak
periods.
   The 9th Circuit court said the EPA violated federal law by
arbitrarily lifting from state officials the burden of proving the
additional measures would not speed up the attainment of cleaner
air.
   ``Arizona has made no claim that any of the measures ... is
impracticable or unreasonable in either Maricopa County or Pima
County,'' the appeals court said. ``The EPA cannot extract leeway
from a statute that Congress explicitly intended to be strict.''
   President Bush signed a new clean air law in November, but the
Arizona residents seeking tougher controls in the two counties said
the new law appears to have no bearing on their case.
   The case is Reilly vs. Delaney, 90-456.

<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West African troops have forced an end
to fighting between rival factions, and relief workers prepared to
distribute food today to starving people in the capital as tensions
relaxed.
   The five-nation West African army turned its guns on rebel
leader Prince Johnson for the first time Sunday when his fighters
refused to halt their fire.
   Johnson ended nearly two months of relative peace in the
Liberian capital and broke a cease-fire signed last week by the
three warring factions by attacking remmants of slain president
Samuel Doe's army on Friday.
   The mercurial rebel leader told reporters he had become
impatient with the slow pace of a promised resettlement of the
discredited government soldiers outside the capital, where they had
been harassing civilians.
   A spokesman for the West African intervention force said
Johnson's attack was ill-considered, but ``it has provided a good
opportunity for us to demilitarize Monrovia and sort out these two
factions.''
   Nkem Agetua, press secretary to army commander Gen. Joshua
Dogonyaro of Nigeria, told The Associated Press today that remnants
of the Liberian army remaining in Monrovia had indicated they were
ready to go to an army barracks 15 miles east of the city, and that
the West Africans intended to help them move soon.
   Many of Johnson's men had to be forced back to a base at
Caldwell, eight miles northeast of Monrovia, he said.
   In one incident, the West Africans were seen arresting more than
50 rebels outside the U.S. Embassy. No shots were fired then, but
there was a shootout when the West Africans forced Johnson's men to
disarm at a bridge linking the city to Monrovia's port.
   Agetua said more than 40 Johnson fighters were detained Sunday.
Independent observers put the number at nearer to 200.
   The spokesman said no force had to be used against the soldiers
because they retreated to their barracks.
   Agetua put the death toll from the fighting at about a dozen
fighters in all from both sides. He said there were no civilian
casualties.
   At least one civilian died during the weekend in an unrelated
incident. Johnson's men shot Moses Willi, a part-time guard at the
British Embassy, at his home in a northern suburb after neighbors
denounced the man as a former Doe soldier. Friends said he was a
former policeman.
   All three warring sides have indiscriminately killed civilians.
At least 10,000 people have been slain. But people in Monrovia said
they feared the soldiers more than the rebels and sympathized with
Johnson's wish to get them out of Monrovia.
   Monrovia's first food distribution in months was stopped last
month because soldiers immediately stole the food from civilians.
   The last distribution - except for supplementary feeding for
children near death - took place three weeks ago.
   People in the street beg for food, mothers pleading their
children have had nothing to eat in days.
   Dozens of articles are on sale in the city, from running shoes
and T-shirts to buttons and batteries. But what little food is
available is too expensive for more people.
   The outbreak of fighting in Monrovia has diverted attention from
the main rebel faction of Charles Taylor, which has overrun the
capital and until signing the cease-fire agreement Wednesday was
the only faction blocking peace.
   Agetua said U.S. Ambassadors Peter De Vos was acting as an
intermediary, arranging a meeting among all the warring factions
and leaders of an interim government chosen by Liberian exiles,
which Taylor does not recognize.
   He said he hoped the meeting would be held within two days,
either in Monrovia or the neighboring state of Sierra Leone.
   The meeting is to organize modalities of a cease-fire, such as a
camp to which Taylor's men could be confined, and to negotiate an
interim government agreeable to all parties.

   The far-right Republican Party suffered a major
setback in the German election, capturing only 2.1 percent of the
vote nationwide, final results indicated today.
   The results wiped out any chance of the party gaining seats
anywhere and ended fears that voters in former East Germany could
swing to the far right after more than 40 years of Communist rule.
   In the five new eastern states, the Republicans received only
1.3 percent of the vote, while in the western region they received
2.3 percent, for a nationwide average of 2.1 percent.
   The ultrarightist party shocked the nation in January 1989 by
getting 7.5 percent of the vote to gain 11 seats in the legislature
of former West Berlin.
   But on Sunday, the Republicans dropped to 2.4 percent of the
vote in a united Berlin, eliminating any chance of them retaining
seats in the city's legislature.
   The party still holds a few seats in some local city councils in
western Germany and the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France,
but the election results indicated their influence was eroding.

<HEAD>Soviet Legislative Leader Gives Stern Warning to Baltics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top Kremlin official warned the Baltic republics
today that even if they refuse to sign a new Union Treaty, they
must remain in the Soviet Union until they follow procedures
established by national law.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has proposed the treaty to hold
the 15 Soviet republics together in a federation. The Baltic
republics of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia refused to participate
in drafting the document and have said they will not sign it.
   Rafik Nishanov, chairman of the Council of Nationalities, one of
the two chambers in the Supreme Soviet legislature, formally
submitted the treaty to lawmakers today.
   ``If the Baltic republics don't accept such a treaty, in my
opinion, they will remain in the Soviet Union on the basis of the
documents with which they joined the union,'' Nishanov told the
legislature.
   He said that under the Soviet Constitution, the Baltic republics
have a right to secede, but only if they first hold referendums and
then follow procedures established by Soviet law.
   Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia were occupied by the Soviet army
at the start of World War II and were annexed in 1945. The Kremlin
has refused to recognize their declarations of independence this
year, saying they violate the Soviet Constitution.
   The Baltic republics contend they were occupied by force and
that their annexation is invalid. The parliaments of all three
republics, meeting in joint session in Vilnius last week, called
for the removal of Soviet ``occupation'' forces and international
recognition of their independence.
   Nishanov's speech indicated the Gorbachev government is
maintaining a hard line on the issue of secession and will not
allow the Union Treaty to become an easy way out for republics
seeking independence.
   Gorbachev sat on the rostrum during the legislative session but
did not speak.
   The new Union Treaty, replacing one signed in 1924, would give
the restive republics more economic and political autonomy. But a
strong central government in Moscow would retain control over
defense, foreign policy, taxation, monetary policy, electric power
and transportation.
   In addition to the Baltic republics, Armenia, Georgia and the
Ukraine have said they will not sign the Union Treaty in its
current form. Georgia's parliament has declared that it wants full
independence, and there are also strong independence movements in
Armenia and the Ukraine.
   Without mentioning Russian republic President Boris N. Yeltsin
by name, Nishanov attacked Yeltsin's proposal for bilateral
treaties between republics.
   Forming ``a union without a center ... would be a step
backward'' after centuries of cooperation between the ethnic groups
in the Soviet Union, he said.
   Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev, the Soviet Army chief-of-staff,
told the legislature that defense had to remain a function of the
central government.
   He noted that defense installations and academies were spread
across the country, and said nuclear weapons should remain under
the control of only a few top officials.
   ``No other way (of handling nuclear weapons) is possible,''
Akhromeyev said. ``That's how it's done both here and in the United
States.''

<HEAD>Court Strengthens Right of Criminal Suspects in Mississippi Case</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts grafs 4-9, In other action, with other cases.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today strengthened the right
of criminal suspects to have lawyers present when they are
questioned by police.
   By a 6-2 vote, the justices overturned the murder conviction of
Mississippi death row inmate Robert S. Minnick, who confessed when
he was questioned without his lawyer present.
   The court said Minnick's rights were violated even though he
earlier had consulted with his lawyer and agreed to talk to
authorities. Unless the suspect initiates such a talk with police,
the court said, he may not be questioned outside the presence of
his lawyer once he has invoked his right to a lawyer.
   In other action, the court:
   - Left intact a lawsuit settlement that eased restrictions on
abortion clinics in Illinois.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by two nurses and
two expectant fathers who said the settlement does not adequately
protect women or fetuses.
   - Refused to kill a lawsuit against a California community
college's officials accused of unlawful censorship for blocking the
on-campus performance of a racially charged play.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by the college
officials.
   - Shielded businesses from some big-money lawsuits filed by
employees who claim they were fired so their employers would not
have to pay pension benefits.
   The court ruled unanimously that fired employees may not sue4 in
state courts over such allegations. The state suits are pre-empted
by a federal law protecting pensions, the court said.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the court in the
confession case, said, ``There can be no doubt that the
interrogation in question was initiated by the police. It was a
formal interview which (Minnick) was compelled to attend.''
   ``Since (Minnick) made a specific request for counsel before the
interview, the police-initiated interrogation was impermissible.''
   In a dissenting opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia said the
majority was ``misguided'' to discourage ``an honest confession.''
   He said the ruling undermines a ``belief in either personal
responsibility or the moral claim of just government to
obedience.'' He was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist.
   Justice David H. Souter did not take part in the case.
   Minnick and James ``Monkey'' Dyess escaped from Clarke County,
Miss., jail in April 1986 and went looking for guns, authorities
said.
   Police said the two men fatally shot Donald Ellis Thomas and
Lamar Lafferty when the victims returned to Thomas's mobile home to
find Minnick and Dyess there.
   Minnick was arrested in Lemon Grove, Calif., on Aug. 22, 1986.
FBI agents ended their questioning of him when he asked for a
lawyer.
   Minnick then met with an attorney who advised him not to answer
any more questions.
   A few days later, Deputy Sheriff J.C. Denham of Clarke County
flew to California and questioned Minnick. The suspect confessed,
saying he shot Lafferty because Dyess was threatening to kill
Minnick if he did not.
   Minnick was convicted in Mississippi and sentenced to death.
   The Mississippi Supreme Court, in upholding his conviction, said
Denham's questioning of Minnick did not violate a rule the U.S.
Supreme Court established in 1981. The high court barred police
from questioning a suspect who has asked for a lawyer unless the
suspect initiates the conversation.
   Today the high court extended that ruling to instances in which
a suspect already has conferred with an attorney.
   Kennedy said the 1981 ruling is designed to prevent police from
badgering a defendant into giving up the right to a lawyer provided
by the court's famous Miranda ruling in 1966.
   The threat of badgering is no less after the suspect has talked
to his lawyer, Kennedy said.
   ``A single consultation with an attorney does not remove the
suspect from persistent attempts by officials to persuade him to
waive his rights or from the coercive pressures that accompany
custody and that may increase as custody is prolonged,'' he said.
   The case is Minnick vs. Mississippi, 89-6332.

<HEAD>Wintry Storm Sweeps Through Midwest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Much of the Midwest and Great Lakes region received an early
jolt of wintry weather today, as snowfalls of up to 10 inches
closed schools, toppled power lines and snarled travel. A blizzard
warning was posted in parts of Wisconsin.
   In hard-hit Iowa, Iowa State and Drake universities were among
among scores of schools and businesses that closed their doors or
delayed opening today as high winds and heavy snows brought much of
Iowa to a standstill. The Dubuque Regional Airport was closed, with
snowdrifts of 2 to 3 feet.
   Forecasters said the storm was caused by an intense low pressure
system that was moving across central Illinois into northern
Indiana this morning, and that the East would begin to feel its
effects later in the day.
   National Weather Service meteorologist Dan Ferry in Des Moines,
Iowa, said the combination of snow and wind was the most severe in
central Iowa in five years.
   Up to 10 inches of snow fell in central and southeast Iowa by
midmorning and the wather service said up to a foot of snow could
be on the ground by tonight. Winds gusting up to 56 mph whipped the
snow, leaving cars and trucks stranded along roadways.
   On Sunday afternoon, a teen-ager was killed near Numa in
southeastern Iowa when the car he was riding in slid off an icy
road and into a ditch.
   The storm knocked out power to 45,000 customers in the Chicago
area, as freezing rain and high winds snapped power lines.
   ``The outages are scattered all over. There's not too many
places that are immune,'' Commonwealth Edison spokesman John Hogan
said. By midmorning, about half the customers had power restored,
he said.
   In Wisconsin, the weather service said blizzard conditions had
developed in the southern part of the state this morning, and it
issued blizzard warnings for some areas. Madison had 7 inches of
snow by 6 a.m.
   The storm was accompanied by strong winds, gusting up to 54 mph
at Milwaukee, causing blowing and drifting snow. That knocked down
power lines in some scattered areas of southeastern Wisconsin. The
Milwaukee and Madison school systems were among those canceling
classes.
   Schools also were closed in Michigan, where the storm dumped up
to 3 inches of snow by the morning rush hour. The snow was expected
to turn to rain during the day in southern Michigan, but more snow
was expected in the northern half of the state.
   State police said at least 45 schools and school districts in
southern lower Michigan called off classes today.
   Elsewhere, the storm dumped up to 8 inches of snow in Southern
Minnesota and forced some schools to close or open late.
   As the storm moved eastward, Buffalo, N.Y., reported its first
major snowstorm of the season. Two inches of snow fell in two hours
this morning, with up to 6 inches expected by the afternoon,
according to the weather service. Dozens of fender-benders, but no
major accidents were reported on the slick Buffalo roads.
   ``The first day like this, everybody has to learn to drive all
over again,'' said Jerry Hooven, an American Automobile Association
spokesman.
   To the West, another storm was blowing into Washington state,
which suffered tens of millions of dollars in damage from two bouts
of record flooding last month.
   Heavy rain was falling along the coast this morning in advance
of a warm front. Parts of the coast received more than 1{ inches
since Sunday evening, and winds of 20 to 35 mph were forecast.

   Former East German leader Erich Honecker said
today that he is not guilty of personally issuing shoot-to-kill
orders at the Berlin Wall, the ADN news agency quoted his lawyer as
saying.
   Wolfgang Ziegler, the lawyer, said the ousted Communist party
boss claimed he is not guilty according to criminal codes that
existed when he was ruling what was then East Germany, the agency
reported.
   Ziegler said it was important to determine whether Honecker
violated firearms laws of former East Germany, what the laws said,
and how they fit in with the current penal code in effect in a
united Germany.
   The lawyer said, however, that Honecker should answer
politically and morally for acts committed as Communist leader.
Honecker, 78, is wanted by German police on charges he signed the
shoot-to kill orders.
   Soviet military officials have prevented German police from
serving an arrest warrant to Honecker, who is at a Soviet military
hospital outside Beelitz, in former East Germany 20 miles south of
Berlin.
   Earlier today, Soviet military doctors ordered Honecker into a
cardiology unit at the Red Army hospital, German radio reported.
   The Sender Freies Berlin radio station quoted a Soviet
interpreter as saying Soviet doctors considered Honecker's
condition ``serious.'' Honecker sought refuge at the hospital in
April.
   A Soviet military doctor with the rank of colonel diagnosed
Honecker as having high blood pressure, the ADN news agency quoted
Igor Molotkin, the interpreter, as saying.
   The agency said Honecker's wife, Margot, called the doctor early
this morning and the ousted party boss was carried on a stretcher
to a cardiology department for treatment.
   German police need permission from Soviet authorities to enter
the hospital complex. A Soviet diplomat said Sunday that the
decision on whether Honecker can be turned over to German
authorities would have to be made at the highest level, presumably
in Moscow.
   A Soviet official at the embassy in Bonn refused to comment on a
report that talks were under way between German and Soviet
officials on handing over Honecker, whose testimony could be
potentially damaging to Moscow.
   Berlin justice officials issued the warrant on Friday, just two
days before the first free elections in a united Germany in 58
years. They based the warrant on new documents recently uncovered
that incriminate Honecker.
   Honecker's lawyers maintain he is too sick to stand trial.
   The arrest warrant charges Honecker with personally signing
shoot-to-kill orders to guards at the Berlin Wall - the border
between former East and West Germany.
   The warrant also links Honecker directly to the deaths of
several people killed while trying to flee the repressive East
German regime before it was toppled in last year's peaceful
revolution.
   Some 200 people died trying to escape from East Germany during
the 28-year existence of the Berlin Wall and the barbed wire
barrier that separated the two German states.
   Honecker also rejected ``responsibility'' for issuing the
shoot-to-kill orders in comments published Nov. 1 in the
London-based weekly newspaper, The European.

   The Russians asking questions about
basketball over the Moscow-to-Washington hot line? The Cold War
really must be over.
   Experts manning the hot line, which was rededicated today after
a $4.7 million upgrade, see evidence of glasnost in test
transmissions from the Soviets.
   ``The project has helped keep the peace all these years and this
upgrade allows us to have state-of-the art communications,'' Lt.
Gen. Jerome B. Hilmes, director of information systems in the
office of the Secretary of the Army, said at a ribbon-cutting
ceremony today.
   Routine, maintenance-related dispatches have actually become
chatty.
   ``Could we ask an unofficial question about basketball?'' the
Soviets asked last February over the communications link set up
after the Cuban missile crisis to avert the accidental outbreak of
war. ``Could you please tell us how our Kurtinaitis performed
against your snipers?''
   The Soviets were referring to Rimas Kurtinaitis, a 6-foot-5 star
from Lithuania. The National Basketball Association had invited
Kurtinaitis to challenge eight NBA stars in a three-point shooting
contest in Houston. ``Snipers'' apparently was the Soviets'
translation of long-range basketball shooters.
   ``We'd like to know how he feels in the NBA,'' the Soviets
asked.
   ``Friends,'' the Americans technicians and linguists on the hot
line replied, ``in the local newspaper it says that Kurtinaitis is
feeling fine, but there are no results from the competition.
They'll probably be in tomorrow's paper.''
   ``Several years ago,'' said Tom Brothers, manager of the hot
line station at Fort Detrick, ``you would have never seen that.''
   Technicians working at Fort Detrick in Frederick make sure the
emergency communications link is available to President Bush and
Mikhail Gorbachev.
   The hot line, established in 1963, allows the superpower heads
of state to circumvent normal diplomatic channels and exchange
written messages. There never was a red phone in the Oval Office,
an image popularized in many movies.
   The modernized operation includes updated transmitters and
receivers, control consoles and two new saucer-shaped satellite
dishes. Replacement parts were becoming scarce for the old dishes.
   ``At this station we never know when the president is using it.
What we do is make sure the hot line is available to him,''
Brothers said. ``Our checks are to make sure the Earth
station-to-Earth station link is OK.''
   This is the line's third upgrade. The first hot line, a
trans-Atlantic teletype cable, was prone to interruptions,
including one caused by a Finnish farmer who cut a cable with his
plow the very first year. In the 1970s, a manhole fire north of
Baltimore cut off the cable's primary circuit. About the same time,
American telephone workers accidentally cut the line's cables.
   Today, each hot line message goes to the Soviet Union three
different ways - over a land cable and through two satellite
systems. The duplication ensures messages arrive at the Kremlin, or
the White House, during a crisis.
   Any message Bush sends to Gorbachev is encoded and taken to an
undisclosed terminal point in Washington. It is transmitted to the
Fort Detrick Earth station, 50 miles northwest of the nation's
capital, where the signal is enhanced and relayed to two Soviet
satellites.
   The satellites, 22,300 miles above the equator, beam the message
to antennae south of Moscow.
   The message is also sent to Moscow via Intelsat, an
American-owned commercial satellite system based in Etam, W.Va.
   Since 1986, the presidents have been able to accompany their
written messages with maps, charts or other graphics.
   ``It takes a matter of seconds for our communications to reach
the Soviet Union,'' said Brothers, one of 13 Field Engineering
Corp. employees who work at the Fort Detrick station.
   Presidents have used the hot line more than 15 times in its
27-year history, said Norm Covert, a spokesman for Fort Detrick.
   One of the most notable uses was during the six-day Arab-Israeli
war in 1967. President Lyndon B. Johnson advised the Soviet Union
of U.S. ship and aircraft movements in the Mediterranean following
an Israeli attack on the USS Liberty.

<HEAD>FDA Approves First Over-the-Counter Drug for Yeast Infections</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts grafs 7-8, In a small, on minimal risk</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration today
approved the first non-prescription drug to treat vaginal yeast
infections, which afflict nearly three-fourths of all women at
least once in their lifetimes.
   Availability of the drug, clotrimazole, for non-prescription
sales will spare many women the inconvenience and expense of going
to a doctor to get a prescription to treat the common infections,
the FDA said.
   ``Clotrimazole is highly effective and carries a minimal risk,''
said Dr. Carl Peck, director of the FDA's Center for Drug
Evaluation and Research, adding that it has a 10-year history of
safe prescription use.
   ``FDA has concluded that the switch of this drug to
non-prescription sale will benefit women - especially those with
recurring infections,'' who will be able to treat themselves, he
said.
   Peck said that as long as the infection is initially diagnosed
by a doctor, a woman can recognize the symptoms and treat herself
without needing a prescription.
   Labeling on the drug's package will say: ``If this is the first
time you are suffering from vaginal itch and discomfort, please
consult your physician.''
   In a small number of cases, use of the drug can cause allergic
reactions, including burning and a rash. More rarely, it has caused
abdominal cramps and bloating, the FDA's Cruzan said.
   Women who are pregnant are advised not to use the product except
under a physician's supervision.
   Vaginal yeast infection, or candidiasis, is an overgrowth of a
naturally occurring fungus called Candida. The overabundance occurs
when the body's natural balance of bacteria is upset. This often
occurs with antibiotics or birth control pills.
   When the yeast overgrows, the resulting infection causes itching
and burning, sometimes with a discharge and soreness.
   However, other conditions, including sexually transmitted
diseases, can cause similar symptoms, which is why a woman should
get an initial diagnosis by a physician, said FDA spokeswoman Susan
Cruzan.
   A brochure that will be sold with the product will advise women
to continue treatment for seven consecutive days, even if the
infection appears to have cleared up before then. If signs of the
infection do not clear up in three days, the brochure advises, the
woman should see a physician.
   The drug, which will be available as a vaginal suppository or as
a cream, is made by Schering-Plough in Kenilworth, N.J., and will
be sold under the trade name Gyne-Lotrimin.
   Nearly 22 million cases of vaginal yeast infections are reported
annually, the company said, and nearly 75 percent of all women will
experience at least one infection.

<HEAD>Court Rules on Phony Mileage Reading Case from Virginia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court ruled today that a federal
anti-counterfeiting law may be used to crack down on the sale of
used cars with phony mileage readings.
   By 5-3 vote, the court upheld the conviction of Raymond J.
Moskal, manager of a Pennsylvania car dealership sentenced under
the law to six months in prison.
   Moskal was convicted of taking part in a scheme in which car
odometers were turned back and ownership titles listing the lower
mileages were obtained in Virginia.
   That process - called ``title washing'' - is covered by a 1939
federal law that makes it a crime to ship ``falsely made''
documents across state lines, said Justice Thurgood Marshall for
the court.
   ``Our conclusion that `falsely made' encompasses genuine
documents containing false information is supported by Congress'
purpose in enacting'' the law, he said. ``Title washes involve
precisely the sort of fraudulent activities that are dispersed
among several states in order to elude state detection.''
   Justice Antonin Scalia, in a dissenting opinion, said the ruling
creates a dangerous precedent because the court is interpreting a
law in a way that seems to conflict with the dictionary meaning of
words.
   Falsely made is not the same thing as false, he said.
   ``A forged memorandum is falsely made,'' Scalia said. ``A
memorandum that contains erroneous information is simply false. The
temptation to stretch the law to fit the evil is an ancient one,
and it must be resisted.''
   He was joined by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony M.
Kennedy.
   Justice David H. Souter did not take part in the ruling.
   Moskal was convicted with Al Davis, owners of the wholesale car
dealership in Manheim, Pa., that Moskal managed, and Dennis Smith,
owner of a dealership in Chesapeake, Va. Davis and Smith did not
appeal to the high court.
   Prosecutors said the ownership certificates from Davis'
dealership were shipped to contacts in Virginia who applied for
titles in that state with the phony lower mileage figures.
   The Virginia titles then were sent back to Davis and he
distributed them to area dealers to sell with the used cars.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the convictions of
the three men.
   But federal appeals courts elsewhere in the nation have struck
down similar convictions on grounds the federal law did not cover
odometer tampering.
   The case is Moskal vs. U.S., 89-964.

<HEAD>Army Deploys in Greater Beirut</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Lebanese army began deploying in both
Moslem and Christian sectors of Beirut today, in the first phase of
a plan to end the country's 15{-year-old civil war.
   About 8,000 troops moved in to replace the rival armed militias
that completed their withdrawal today.
   People lined the streets in the Christian, eastern sector of the
capital, to cheer the government troops. Women showered the
soldiers with flower petals, rice and scented rose water.
   The restitution of state authority is seen as a major
achievement in the government's efforts to end the civil strife
that has left more than 150,000 people dead.
   The first phase of the plan went into effect with the completion
earlier today of the withdrawal of all warring militias from the
greater Beirut area. This extends along a 15-mile coastal strip
between the Kelb River in the north and Damour River in the south.
   The army started moving in after the 6,000-strong Lebanese
Forces militia led by Christian warlord Samir Geagea withdrew from
eastern Beirut to positions in the Christian hinterland of Kesrouan
province.
   The last remaining 2,000 Lebanese Forces troops rumbled out of
the neighborhoods of Ashrafiyeh, Karantina and Nabaa in a convoy of
400 military vehicles. The convoy included 30 tanks decorated with
colored portraits of Geagea and the militia's flag of a green cedar
tree on a white background.
   Some trucks towed Soviet-made 130mm howitzers and twin-barrelled
anti-aircraft guns. About 1,660 tons of ammunition were taken from
the city over the previous week.
   ``Today we complete our withdrawal from Greater Beirut which
will come under the protection of the Lebanese army. We hope the
army will soon be in control throughout the nation,'' said the
militia's Voice of Free Lebanon radio.
   Lebanese army troops of the mainly Christian 5th Brigade moved
into areas evacuated by the Lebanese Forces. Soldiers of the
predominantly Moslem 6th and 12th Brigades were deployed along the
five-mile Green Line, which had split Beirut into Moslem and
Christian sectors since the outbreak of the civil war in 1975.
   Army troops also started deploying in the Moslem western and
southern sectors of the capital and in the predominantly Druse
mountains east and southeast of Beirut.
   The main Moslem Shiite and Druse militias announced last month
they had completed the withdrawal of their militias from Greater
Beirut.
   Withdrawal of the rival militias was part of an Arab
League-brokered peace plan to end the civil war. Subsequent phases
envisage the complete disbandment of the rival militias.

   Soldiers sealed the homes of three Arab
teen-agers arrested in a weekend stabbing attack on a Tel Aviv bus
in which an Israeli and one of the assailants were killed, the army
said today.
   Moslem fundamentalist leaders of the 3-year-old Palestinian
uprising in the Israeli-occupied territories put out leaflets
praising the stabbings.
   ``We will continue our revolution with knives,'' said the Jihad
Islami, or Islamic Holy War, faction. The Hamas, or Zeal, movement
urged ``using all means'' to escalate attacks on Israelis.
   It was the bloodiest incident in greater Tel Aviv, Israel's most
populous area, since Arabs began a wave of stabbing attacks on Jews
in October. The attacks followed the police slaying of Arabs on
Jerusalem's Temple Mount.
   Police announced that in the wake of Sunday's attack they would
tighten controls on Palestinians entering Israel from the West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
   Radio stations reported increased checks this morning on
Palestinian-owned vehicles entering the Tel Aviv area from the West
Bank.
   In the attack Sunday, three Palestinian youths from the West
Bank boarded a bus bound for Tel Aviv then later stood up and
knifed four passengers shouting ``Allahu Akbar!'' Arabic for ``God
is great.''
   A 24-year-old Jewish seminary student, Baruch Heisler, died of
throat and chest wounds suffered in the attack. Three other Israeli
passengers, all teen-agers, were also wounded.
   A police officer who helped subdue the attackers, shot and
killed one of them, 17-year-old Jafaar Omar Fares Dawikat.
   The other two assailants were injured. One was shot in the hand,
and the other was beaten by passersby, Israeli reports said. They
were later identified as Mohammed Abdul Majid Sawalha, 19, and
Munir Hussein Ahmad Sawalha, 17.
   Soldiers sealed the home of Dawikat's family in the area of
Nablus and the two Sawalha family houses in nearby Azmut this
morning, the army said.
   Army radio mentioned the sealings, which are done routinely to
the homes of Arabs suspected of participating in attacks. The three
suspects were all from large families and the sealings put 37
people out on the street.
   A military court, meanwhile, sentenced 12 Palestinian guerrillas
to 30 years in prison for an aborted seaborne attack six months ago
aimed at the U.S. Embassy and Israeli civilians.
   The attempted raid on May 30 was claimed by the Palestine
Liberation Front, a PLO faction headed by Mohammed Abbas, also
known as Abul Abbas.

   Continental Airlines Holdings Inc. filed for
protection from creditors under federal bankruptcy laws today,
blaming the move on a stunning rise in fuel costs and heavy debts
accrued in the free-spending 1980s.
   It was the first bankruptcy-court refugee in the airline
business since the dramatic leap in fuel prices caused by the
Persian Gulf crisis, and underscored the financial beating taken by
all airlines because of a weakening economy, with fewer passengers
flying and booking tickets.
   The move also marked a rapidly deteriorating situation for
Continental, once the nation's biggest airline operator, which only
a few weeks ago rejected the bankruptcy-court option.
   Based in Houston, Continental is best known as the child of
one-time airline entrepreneur Frank Lorenzo, who built it into a
major force in the airline industry through aggressive
price-cutting and debt-financed expansion after a previous stint in
bankruptcy court seven years ago.
   Continental officials said they expected to operate normally
through the holiday season and passengers would notice no
difference in service.
   ``Essentially, we're allowed to treat the traveling public,
travel agents, tour operators, just as if the bankruptcy hadn't
occurred ...,'' said Paul P. Welsh, a Continental attorney. ``There
will not be anyone stranded.''
   The airline filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy laws in Wilmington, Del., where it is incorporated.
Under Chapter 11, a company gets a reprieve from debts while it
works out a way to pay the bills and tries to re-emerge from court
protection as a healthy business.
   As part of the bankruptcy filing, Continental said it agreed to
sell its prized Seattle-to-Tokyo route to American Airlines for
$150 million, pending approval of the court.
   Today's filing marks the second bankruptcy-court stint for
Continental. In 1983, amid a bitter labor dispute with the
airline's unions, then-chairman Frank Lorenzo plunged the airline
into bankruptcy court, scapped union contracts and hired low-cost
replacements for workers striking at the time.
   The incident eventually led to changes in the law to limit
companies' right to abrogate union contracts by bankruptcy filing.
   In today's statement, Continental, the nation's fifth-largest
airline, said the latest financial woes were brought on by high jet
fuel costs and a high debt load, which have ``created a temporary
cash shortage for the airline.''
   The airline listed total assets of $4.77 billion and liabilities
of $5.85 billion.
   ``Continental has made these decisions reluctantly,'' Hollis
Harris, chairman, president and chief executive of Continental,
told a news conference in Wilmington. ``We couldn't handle the debt
and the cost of fuel at the same time. Fuel is our highest item of
operating costs.''
   Harris said that since July, Continental was paying $70 milion
per month more in jet fuel because of the recent runup in oil
prices. He said fuel costs made up about a quarter of its operating
costs.
   Continental lost $88.3 million in the third quarter of this
year, compared with a loss of $158 million in 1989. For the first
nine months, losses totaled $97 million, compared with a $522.8
million loss last year.
   Harris said he forsaw no need for layoffs, pay cuts or
reductions in benefits to the airline's 37,000 employees as a
result of the bankruptcy-court move.
   Raymond E. Neidl, an airline analyst with Dillon Read &amp; Co. in
New York, said if Continental's creditors agree to a reorganization
plan early on, ``they still have chance of survival'' because
``they have a good, solid domestic system and they have a low
operating cost structure.''
   Continental, which was known as Texas Air Corp. until this
summer, is the parent of Continental Airlines and Eastern Airlines.
Eastern filed for bankruptcy protection in 1989 and has been run by
a government-appointed trustee since April 10.
   Continental had been rumored to be considering filing for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the past several weeks.
   As recently as late October, the company said its board of
directors, including Lorenzo, unanimously rejected a proposal to
file, saying it would consider possible asset sales, cost controls
or seek new investors.
   Continental sold a 16.8 percent stake to Scandinavian Airline
System in August and Lorenzo stepped down as chairman, although he
remains on the board.

   When Mary Hoffman joined the Army during World
War II, she was a serious young woman who thought she'd already
missed her chance for a full life. But the Women's Auxiliary Army
Corps changed everything.
   ``I thought I was going to be a spinster,'' she recalled 47
years later. ``Instead, I married my first bedside patient.''
   Mrs. Hoffman is one of the 350,000 women who served in World War
II. She is also the largest single donor to the foundation that's
trying to build a memorial to America's women veterans. Mrs.
Hoffman has contributed more than $60,000 to the project, all from
disability payments she received after breast cancer forced her to
leave the service in 1945.
   Mrs. Hoffman, now an 83-year-old widow, says women veterans need
their own memorial.
   Male war veterans have their monuments and memorials, but ``we
are the last group to unite,'' she said from her home in
Hyattsville, Md. ``I do feel it's so well worth it.''
   Mrs. Hoffman spent two years in the WAC as an occupational
therapist, stationed at Woodrow Wilson Hospital in Staunton, Va.
Her job was to go from bedside to bedside, helping injured soldiers
make wallets or belts or teaching them to type or knit.
   ``I didn't have a sense of humor when I first went into the
military,'' she remembered. ``I was a little old-fashioned, wearing
my hair up. But the Army made me over, believe me.''
   Mrs. Hoffman's small story is one of almost 50,000 collected so
far for a databank that will be part of the memorial, said retired
U.S. Air Force Brig. Gen. Wilma Vaught, president of the Women in
the Military Service of America Foundation.
   Vaught is delighted with Mrs. Hoffman's generosity. But she
needs a total of $25 million for the memorial and at the moment,
she's about $22.5 million short.
   ``There are over 1.2 million living women veterans and 400,000
women on active duty and in the Guard and reserve'' who are
potential donors, Vaught said in a recent interview at the
foundation's Arlington, Va., offices.
   Part of Vaught's problem is finding those women, as well as the
descendants of the thousands of American women who served in every
war since the Revolution - as nurses, scouts, suppliers, soldiers
and saboteurs.
   Privacy laws prevent Vaught from getting the addresses of
veterans or active-duty military women from the government. She has
been relying on some 450 volunteers to find them.
   The Women in Military Service Memorial also suffered a
fund-raising setback this year. The foundation tried to raffle a $1
million house in suburban Centreville, Va., only to see ticket
sales fall far below target.
   ``We saw this as a mechanism that in a really short period of
time we could raise a lot of money,'' Vaught said.
   But the kickoff coincided with the drug trial of D.C. Mayor
Marion Barry, and media attention was nominal, she said.
   When the date for the drawing approached in early November, the
foundation had sold only about 24,000 of the one million raffle
tickets printed. Vaught was forced to postpone the drawing until
Feb. 23.
   There's been progress in other areas. The site has been chosen:
the ceremonial entrance gate to Arlington National Cemetery. The
foundation conducted a design competition last year and selected a
concept by Marion G. Weiss and Michael Manfredi, partners in a New
York architecture firm.
   Their design sets 10 39-foot glass spires into the top of the
semicircular gate, known as the Hemicycle. Inside the entrance
walls will be a museum portraying the history of women in the U.S.
military, a 225-seat auditorium, and the databank.
   At night, the spires will be gently lit, giving the effect of
candles against the Virginia hillside.
   Vaught is very conscious that time is essential. Under the law
authorizing the memorial, Vaught has until November 1991 to raise
the $25 million.
   ``That date may be a little optimistic,'' she said, adding that
she is prepared to go back to Congress to ask for more time.
   Meanwhile, as she travels the country meeting women veterans and
promoting the memorial, she is most impressed by the World War I
veterans.
   ``We still have a few World War I women left who can make it to
the dedication,'' she said. ``If we're going to do something to say
thank-you to them, it's got to be now.''

<TEXT>
   Ireland's first woman president, Mary
Robinson, was inaugurated Monday and extended a hand to both
Protestants and Catholics in troubled, British-ruled Northern
Ireland.
   In her acceptance speech, delivered in English and Gaelic, the
46-year-old lawyer said she would represent a ``new Ireland.''
   ``I want to do this with no hidden agenda, no strings
attached,'' said Mrs. Robinson, a Roman Catholic who married a
Protestant. ``As the person chosen by you to symbolize this
republic ... I will seek to encourage mutual understanding and
tolerance between all the different communities sharing this
island.''
   A 21-gun salute echoed across the Irish capital as Mrs. Robinson
was sworn in by Chief Justice Thomas Finlay following an
interdenominational service at the medieval, turreted Dublin
Castle.
   About 500 government and church dignitaries and Dublin-based
foreign diplomats looked on as Mrs. Robinson took the oath of
office.
   The ceremony was televised live in Britain and in the Irish
Republic, where schools were closed for the day.
   Mrs. Robinson extended an invitation to Irish descendants
worldwide to visit the republic.
   ``There are over 70 million people living on this globe who
claim Irish descent and I will be proud to represent them,'' Mrs.
Robinson said. ``And I would like to see ... my official residence
to serve on something of an annual basis as a place where our
immigrant communities could send representatives for a get-together
of the extended Irish family abroad.''
   Mrs. Robinson said that in her seven-year term she would
continue Ireland's tradition of promoting international human
rights, particularly in Latin America and Africa.
   She campaigned on a platform of change and a more involved
presidency, winning the Nov. 9 election with 52.8 percent of the
vote.
   After her victory, Mrs. Robinson thanked the women of Ireland
who voted for her and ``instead of rocking the cradle, rocked the
system.''
   In her acceptance speech, the president and mother of three
addressed Irish women.
   ``As a woman I want women who have felt themselves outside
history to be written back into history ... finding a voice where
they have found a vision,'' she said.
   Britain sent troops to Northern Ireland in 1969 to end sectarian
and political violence. Nearly 2,900 people have died in bombings
and assassinations since.
   The Irish Republican Army is fighting British rule in Northern
Ireland and wants to unite the predominantly Protestant province
with the 95 percent Catholic republic of Ireland under Socialist
rule.

   Vandals pillaged a mausoleum and
scattered remains from 21 coffins during what appeared to be
satanic rituals on the French island, police reported Monday.
   No suspects had been arrested.
   The vandals wrote ``Satan worshipers will destroy you'' on the
walls of the mausoleum over the weekend, police said. They also
killed several chickens and threw them on a fire.
   Police said only one coffin was left untouched.
   The mausoleum recently has been a hangout for young people
taking drugs and drinking, new problems on the traditionally Roman
Catholic island, they said.

   Simone Cousteau, who accompanied her husband,
Jacques-Yves Cousteau, on hundreds of voyages aboard the marine
research ship Calypso, has died at her home in Monaco, the Cousteau
Foundation said Monday. She was 72.
   Mrs. Cousteau died Sunday. The cause of death was not given.
   Married in 1937, the Cousteaus for many years spent most of
their time aboard the Calypso, sailing throughout the world to
study marine biology, conduct underwater explorations, make films
and promote conservation.
   Known by the Calypso's crew as ``the shepherdess,'' Mrs.
Cousteau served as nurse and purser, and sometimes participated in
underwater missions.
   She is survived by her husband and a son, Jean-Michel. A second
son, Philippe, died in an airplane crash in 1981.
   Funeral arrangements were not announced.

   Selangor state's royal ruler said
Monday that thieves have stolen his ceremonial golden belt, which
was studded with dozens of diamonds and rubies.
   ``I am very sad over the theft,'' Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah said.
``This is the third time such a thing has happened, the first being
the theft of the state ceremonial mace two years ago and the
attempted theft of my car. I don't know what else will go missing
next.''
   The sultan told a news conference at his palace in Klang, 21
miles west of here, that the Pending Emas Bertahta Berlian, a
ceremonial golden belt worn by him at official functions, was
stolen from the state museum on Nov. 27. It had been on exhibit to
mark the silver jubilee of his reign.
   The belt, inlaid with 45 diamonds and 25 rubies, was made on the
orders of his late father, Sultan Hisamuddin Shah, in 1950 and cost
$31,500. The mace also had precious stones on it.
   The sultan said he believed the belt was stolen by the same
person or group that stole the mace, but he did not elbaborate. He
offered an $11,100 reward to anyone who helped arrest those
responsible, the National News Agency Bernama reported from Klang.
   The sultan blamed the theft on carelessness by police and museum
officials and said he had ordered that all Royal regalia be kept in
a bank vault.
   The 64-year-old sultan is the constitutional monarch of Selangor
state, which surrounds Kuala Lumpur.

   The government on Monday decided to
stiffen the punishment of kidnappingsffor ransom, raising the
sentence from life in prison to death by hanging to try to halt the
rising number of abductions.
   Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz told reporters the decision was
taken at a Cabinet meeting.
   ``There has been a rising tide of kidnappings,'' Aziz said.
``Strictest punishment is needed.''
   Pakistan's criminal law called for life imprisonment and
forefeiture of property for kidnapping, but that will be amended to
include the death penalty, Aziz said.
   Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif announced the plan three weeks ago,
prompting speculation that the harsher punishment was aimed at Asif
Ali Zardari, the husband of ousted Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.
   Zardari is in jail in Karachi for his alleged role in the
kidnapping and extortion of a Pakistani-born British businessman.
Zardari twice has been refused bail.
   The government denies anyone is the target of the new law.
   Aziz said the amendment will be introduced before the National
Assembly, the law-making lower house of Parliament, for
ratification later this month.
   Kidnappings for ransom has increased dramatically in the past
two years in southern Sindh province, especially in Karachi, the
country's largest city and its financial and industrial center.
   Scores of wealthy businessmen and their familes have been the
main targets. Most have been released after their families paid
huge ransoms.
   Politicians had blamed the crime on what is popularly known as
the ``Kalashnikov and heroin culture,'' a referrence to the
automatic rifle that has flooded Pakistan during the war in
neighboring Afghanistan and the drug industry it spawned.

<HEAD>Court Resolves Deadline for Job-Bias Suits in Texas Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today resolved conflicting
rulings by federal appeals courts around the country over the
deadline federal employees face when suing over alleged on-the-job
bias.
   The court, by a 6-2 vote, said such suits against federal
employers sometimes may be allowed even if the 30-day deadline is
missed.
   Some appeals courts had disallowed such waivers for suits
against the federal government while allowing more deadline
flexibility in suits against private employers.
   But by a separate 7-1 vote, the court ruled that the 30-day
deadline begins when the office of the suing person's lawyer
receives a right-to-sue letter from the federal Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission.
   There had been some confusion in lower courts about whether the
30-day period began to run only when the suing persons themselves
or their lawyers, not their lawyers' office, received notice of the
right to sue.
   Writing for the high court in a Texas case, Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist said federal courts need not throw out all
such bias lawsuits filed past the deadline.
   But Rehnquist added that no waiver is required when the delay
was caused by a lawyer's absence from the law office where the
right-to-sue notice was received.
   The decision killed a suit by Shirley W. Irwin, a handicapped
former employee of the Veterans Administration Medical Center in
Waco, Texas.
   Irwin's suit said the VA fired him illegally in 1986.
   Justices Byron R. White and Thurgood Marshall voted to make the
30-day deadline apply to all suits by federal employees, regardless
of the reason for delay.
   Justice John Paul Stevens voted to have the 30-day deadline
begin to run only when the suing employees themselves receive
notice of their right to sue.
   The case is Irwin vs. VA, 89-5867.

Argentina situation.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   President Bush today hailed
``extraordinary political and economic change'' in the Western
Hemisphere as he kicked off a five-nation South American visit. He
vowed not to let his tour be interrupted by military turmoil in
Argentina.
   In an appearance before a joint session of the Brazilian
Congress, Bush praised Brazil for being among the first countries
to impose economic sanctions against Iraq. He said the high oil
prices resulting from the Persian Gulf crisis are costing Brazil $5
billion annually. However, local experts said Bush's figure seemed
excessive.
   ``I realize the sacrifices that Saddam (Hussein's) brutality has
caused this nation,'' Bush siid, departing from his prepared text.
   As the president arrived in Brazil at dawn, nationalist officers
seized army headquarters at Buenos Aires and President Carlos Menem
declared a state of siege, a presidential spokesman said.
   Bush, scheduled to visit Argentina and hold talks with Menem on
Wednesday, told reporters, ``I have no thoughts of changing my
plans. I have great confidence in the security there.''
   Bush's top State Department aide on Latin America, Bernard
Aronson, said the situation in Argentina was ``all right.''
   ``I don't know if it's entirely over but it doesn't sound too
serious. There's a small group in the military that has certain
grievances and every once in while something like this happens,''
said Aronson, who was traveling with Bush.
   Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, accompanying
Bush on his trip, telephoned the U.S. Embassy in Argentina and was
told that rebel forces were in three locations in Buenos Aires.
Government forces were en route to talk them into giving up,
presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   Fitzwater added that it seems likely the incident was intended
to embarrass Menem before Bush's visit.
   ``It's also the reason we want to make clear our support for
democracy and President Menem,'' Fitzwater said.
   In another development, police said bombs exploded Sunday in a
Mormon chapel and in the offices of two right-wing political
parties in Chile, another country on Bush's travel schedule.
Authorities blamed a small radical leftist guerrilla group.
   An anonymous caller told a news agency that the blasts were ``an
offensive'' to protest Bush's visit to Santiago on Thursday.
   Bush seemed in good spirits as he arrived at a military air base
here.
   Bush and President Fernando Collor de Mello opened their meeting
by talking about the impact on world oil prices and the global
economy of Iraq's takeover of Kuwait.
   Bush mentioned the figure $1.5 billion, presumably talking about
the impact that President Vaclav Havel told him the occupation was
having on Czechoslovakia. ``That's why, when people say to me that
this can go on and on, I say, `No!,' Bush said.
   Later, in his speech to Congress, Bush hailed the
``extraordinary political and economic change that is transforming
the face of this hemisphere.''
   He described Brazil as a leader in this effort, citing Collor's
efforts at reducing the size of the state, privatizing enterprises,
combatting inflation and liberalizing trade.
   These steps, he said, ``are the keys to growth and prosperity in
the global economy of the 21st Century.''
   He added: ``Our thinking must be bold, our will resolute. Our
challenge now is to hew out of a wilderness of competing interests
a new kind of opportunity in the Americas.
   ``To fulfill the new world's destiny, all of the Americas and
the Caribbean must embark on a venture for the coming century: To
create the first fully democratic hemisphere in the history of
mankind,'' Bush said.
   There were no urgent issues to be discussed on Bush's agenda,
but he wants to associate himself with what he sees as a rare
opportunity in hemispheric relations. The first four countries on
Bush's itinerary - Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina and Chile - all were
under military rule within the last few years and now have elected
governments. The fifth country, Venezuela, has been democratic
since 1958. Bush is making the trip at a time of unusual harmony in
U.S.-Latin American relations.
   The South American tour was to have taken place in September but
was postponed because of the Persian Gulf crisis. Secretary of
State James A. Baker III stayed behind in Washington to deal with
that issue.
   The centerpiece of Bush's policy toward Latin America is the
Enterprise for the Americas Initiative, which is designed to
achieve economic growth through expanded trade and investment and
reduced debt.
   Bush's goal is a hemisphere-wide free trade area. Just a week
ago, Bush was in Mexico to push for a bilateral free trade
agreement with that country.
   Although military rule gave way to elected government in much of
the hemisphere during the 1980s, the decade was a disaster
economically. Production, investment and consumption all fell
sharply.
   Collor is part of a new generation of Latin leaders who have
moved aggressively to reduce the state role in the economy and to
reduce inflation through spending cuts. Inflation dropped
dramatically shortly after Collor took office in March but is now
again on the rise.
   Brazil's foreign debt is $112 billion, the largest in any
developing country. The country is almost $10 billion in arrears on
debt repayments and is negotiating a new repayment schedule with
creditors.
   In what the administration sees as a breakthrough in its goal of
nuclear non-proliferation, Brazil and Argentina last week agreed to
renounce the manufacture of nuclear weapons.

<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who triumphed in
the first free all-German elections in 60 years, began talks today
on forming a new coalition and discussed the new Germany's role in
the Persian Gulf.
   ``On international levels, one is conscious of a special
responsibility,'' he told reporters a day after his center-right
coalition rode to victory, buoyed by his own popularity as a
champion of quick unity.
   But Kohl indicated Germany would probably not be able to quickly
make a constitutional change that would be needed to allow the
deployment of German troops in the Persian Gulf or elsewhere
outside NATO areas.
   ``We will discuss this within the coalition ... I don't see this
situation at the moment,'' he said. Kohl himself proposed the
amendment, but many of the opposition Social Democrats have
criticized it.
   Kohl said he had already begun initial talks on forming a new
coalition with his Christian Democratic Union's current governing
partners, the Christian Social Union and the Free Democrats.
   He has indicated he wants to have his Cabinet in place by
Christmas, but his coalition colleagues are pressing him for
instant decisions on his next Cabinet.
   One decision was made for him when Economics Minister Helmut
Haussmann said he was quitting the Cabinet amid what German
television claimed was growing criticism over Haussmann's handling
of the economy.
   Haussmann was a major force in putting together the economic and
monetary union of West Germany and East Germany in July, a crucial
step toward full unification Oct. 3. He gave no reason for
quitting.
   But Stern magazine released an interview with central bank chief
Karl Otto Poehl, who criticized Kohl's plans to borrow up to $100
billion next year to finance unification. Poehl's comments were
confirmed by the Bundesbank's press office.
   The big losers in Sunday's elections were the leftist Social
Democrats, the main opposition party, and the far-leftist Greens.
Both parties had criticized Kohl's rapid pace of unification and
accused his Christian Democrats of underplaying the cost of bring
the east up to the standard of the west.
   The Greens, Europe's most-established ecology movement, lost
most of their seats in parliament, receiving only 3.9 percent of
the vote in western Germany. The Social Democrats, led by Oskar
Lafontaine, polled 33.5 percent.
   Kohl's center-right governing coalition won 54.8 percent of the
vote.
   The government put turnout at 78.5 percent of 60 million
eligible voters.
   Berlin - the united Germany's designated capital - held its
first combined city elections in 44 years Sunday. The conservative
slate won the most votes but appeared to lack the majority needed
to unseat Mayor Walter Momper's Social Democrat-led administration.
   The Christian Democrats were projected to win 40.1 percent of
the vote in Berlin, compared to 30.3 percent for the Social
Democrats.
   Sunday's elections marked the first free balloting in a united
Germany since Adolf Hitler's rise to power ended in the devastation
of World War II, and capped a year of political victories for Kohl.
   The 60-year-old chancellor, who championed the swift merger of
the two Germanys and now begins a third four-year term, was
jubilant and confident after his victory.
   But he conceded difficult challenges lie ahead, especially
restructuring the economy in eastern Germany.
   ``I have never kept secret the problems that we have,'' Kohl
said in a televised panel discussion that included Lafontaine. ``It
is a difficult transition period.''
   He predicted, however, that within four years prosperity will
exist across all of Germany, that ``the strengths of the social
market economy, reasonably applied, will create a huge, united,
flourishing landscape.''
   Lafontaine acknowledged his party had misjudged the popularity
Kohl won in uniting the two Germanys. He also conceded that ``in
the long term people will be better off'' in what was East Germany.

<TEXT>
   State casino investigators today
expressed concern about the financial stability of Donald Trump's
Taj Mahal Casino Resort but said it was still too early to
accurately predict the gambling hall's fate.
   In a statement before the state Casino Control Commission,
Deputy Attorney General Thomas Auriemma said the Taj Mahal's slot
machine performance continues to lag and that a debt restructuring
agreement reached with bondholders on Nov. 16 fails to reduce the
gambling hall's $675 million debt.
   ``The Taj Mahal is not reducing its overall debt,'' Auriemma
said.
   Auriemma and Trump attorney Nicholas Ribis agreed that the
commission can examine the restructuring agreement although its
exact terms have yet to be finalized.
   Auriemma also said it was it was too soon for state gaming
regulators to gauge whether the agreement would stabilize the
casino.
   He spoke as the casino commission opened a hearing to examine
the financial stability of the Taj, which opened last spring and is
undergoing restructuring that will temporarily throw it into
bankruptcy court.
   If they conclude that the casino is financially unstable, the
commission members could lift its license and appoint a conservator
to operate it.
   Trump himself was not at the hearing this morning. It is
expected to last at least two days. The flamboyant developer,
author of the best seller ``The Art of the Deal,'' has battled
financial and marital problems for most of the year.
   Since gambling came to the Boardwalk in 1978, only one of 13
casinos - Elsinore's Atlantis Casino Hotel - has lost its license
because of financial problems.
   The commission had planned to evaluate all three Trump casinos -
the Trump Castle, Trump Plaza and Taj Mahal - after giving its
approval in August to a $65 million emergency bank loan in June
that allowed Trump to make an overdue payment to Trump Castle
bondholders. Trump put up his casinos as collateral for the new
loans.
   Commission spokesman Tom Flynn said the regulatory panel will
look only at the Taj Mahal for now but may check the Trump Castle
and Trump Plaza later.
   ``It would have been too cumbersome to look at all three,''
Flynn said.
   Among the evidence at today's hearing is an August report on the
casino issued by the state Division of Gaming Enforcement that
accurately predicted Trump would miss a $47.3 million interest
payment to Taj Mahal bondholders Nov. 15.
   That report concluded, ``Simply put, the (Trump) organization is
in dire financial straits.''
   An updated report on the casino's status will also be submitted,
said gaming division spokesman Wayne Marlin. He would not comment
on the contents of that report.
   Marlin said the division, an arm of the attorney general's
office, would not take a position on whether the Taj Mahal should
keep its license.
   Stephen Bollenbach, chief financial officer of the Trump
Organization, said the commission would find the restructuring for
the Taj Mahal leaves the casino in sound shape despite a weakened
economy.
   ``Based on the revised deal with bondholders, there's no doubt
we're financially stable,'' Bollenbach said. ``Nothing in the world
we live in today looks like it did six months ago.''
   Trump, who is restructuring $675 million in Taj Mahal bonds,
will enter into a ``prepackaged'' bankruptcy filing that allows the
casino to emerge quickly from court protection. He made the deal
shortly after missing the Nov. 15 interest payment.
   The agreement cuts the bonds' interest rate from 14 percent to
12 percent and gives bondholders half the stock in the Taj Mahal.
   The Taj Mahal set city records for gross gaming revenues, or
``win,'' but still reported losing $11 million during the third
quarter of this year. The casino said its gross profits were
dragged down by $26.51 million in interest payments.

   A doctor whose device was used by a woman
to commit suicide was charged today with murder.
   Dr. Jack Kevorkian was charged in the death of Janet Adkins, 54,
who traveled to suburban Detroit last June to use an apparatus he
devised.
   He hooked her up to the intradvenous device, then she pushed a
button that triggered a flow of coma and death-inducing drugs into
her bloodstream.
   Mrs. Adkins f Portland, Ore., had been diagnosed a year earlier
with Alzheimer's disease, a degenerative brain and nerve disorder.
   ``Janet Adkins was not terminally ill. She was not suffering any
pain,'' Oakland County Prosecutor Richard Thompson said today at a
news conference to announce the murder charge. ``For me not to
charge Dr. Kevorkian would turn Oakland County into the suicide
mecca of our nation.''
   If convicted, Kevorkian could be senteced to life in prison. He
has contended that assisting suicide is not a crime under Michigan
law. Michigan now has no specific law against suicide or assisting
it.
   Mrs. Adkins' family said she wanted to end her life before her
condition worsened. The device was used in Kevorkian's van in a
park about 40 miles north of Detroit.
   Thompson had delayed filing charges, saying he was awaiting
autopsy results to determine whether Mrs. Adkins had a terminal
illness.
   Kevorkian, 63, a retired pathologist and advocate of
doctor-assisted suicide, said Sunday he expected to be charged in
the case.
   ``How could he claim murder? I didn't kill anybody,'' Kevorkian
said. ``It wasn't malicious disregard for life.''
   Prosecutors obtained a temporary injunction against Kevorkian to
keep him from using the machine, which they seized, and from aiding
other suicides.
   A hearing had been set for Tuesday to determine whether
Kevorkian could have his machine back.
   State police and the Michigan State Medical Society have said
they also were investigating Mrs. Adkins' death, but have issued no
formal findings.

   Government troops today
surrounded bases and buildings seized before dawn by mutinous
soldiers in an uprising two days before President Bush was
scheduled to visit.
   President Carlos Menem declared a state of siege, suspending
constitutional guarantees and giving his government sweeping powers
to ensure public order. His government demanded that the rebels
surrender unconditionally.
   Bush, in Brazil, indicated he had no plans to cancel his visit
to Argentina, and the military said the situation was being brought
under control. The rebels said they were not trying to overthrow
the government, but were trying to force changes in the way the
military was run.
   The uprising, the fourth military revolt in Argentina in four
years, began when insurgent soldiers seized part of the downtown
army headquarters, several coast guard buildings nearby, a tank
factory 16 miles to the northwest and infantry base five miles to
the north.
   Loyal troops tried to retake the installations, but by afternoon
the rebels were still holed up in the buildings they seized. The
army said at least three loyal soldiers were killed and 14 wounded
in the fighting.
   Police sealed off major roads in Buenos Aires, a city of 10
million people. Federal police banned public gatherings, and the
Economy Ministry declared a bank holiday.
   The army said a total of 200 rebel soldiers were involved, but
rebels claimed 700 followers at several bases, including a tank
batallion in Entre Rios Province, north of Buenos Aires Province.
   The private news agency Noticias Argentinas said government
troops were mining the exits from the tank factory to prevent the
rebels from driving tanks out.
   It also said the government troops had dynamited a bridge and
blocked a tunnel that cross the Parana River north of the capital
to prevent a column of rebel tanks and armored vehicles from
leaving Entre Rios Province.
   The army chief of staff, Gen. Martin Bonnet, said in a
communique that the army is ``under the orders of their commanders,
except for small groups that are being put under control.''
   In the capital, rebels fired at and hit a helicopter carrying
Vice President Eduardo Duhalde as it landed on the roof of
Government House, two blocks from the downtown army headquarters.
Duhalde was unhurt.
   Gunfire was heard in the port zone two blocks to the other side
of Government House, where Menem and Duhalde have their offices.
   Bush, who arrived in Brazil today, said his visit was still on.
   ``I have no thoughts of changing my plans. I have great
confidence in the security there,'' he told reporters in Brazil.
   Bush's top State Department aide on Latin America, Bernard
Aronson, said the situation in Argentina was ``all right.''
   ``I don't know if it's entirely over, but it doesn't sound too
serious. There's a small group in the military that has certain
grievances and every once in while something like this happens,''
said Aronson, who was traveling with the president.
   White House spoksman Marlin Fitzwater added that it seemed
likely the incident was intended to embarrass Menem before Bush's
visit.
   ``It's also the reason we want to make clear our support for
democracy and President Menem,'' Fitzwater said.
   The insurrection was the first in Argentina since Menem took
office in July 1989. He is the country's second civilian president
since the military ceded power in 1983.
   All of the previous insurrections have been by officers who
declare themselves nationalists and demand pay increases, pardons
for rights abuses during the 1976-83 military regime, and changes
in the military high command.
   Military pay - like the pay of most Argentines - has been
severely reduced by hyperinflation and government budget cuts.
   A spokesman for the rebels, an unidentified lieutenant, said,
``This is not a coup. We recognize the authority of President Menem
as commander-in-chief.''
   But, he told reporters: ``Our generals don't represent the
sentiment nor the thought of our army.''
   A rebel spokesman, retired Maj. Hugo Abete, said the plotters
were followers of Col. Mohammed Ali Seineldin, who was cashiered
after he led the previous military uprising, in December 1988.
   Seineldin has been under military arrest for several weeks for
delivering a letter critical of the high command to Menem. He is
held at a base in San Martin de los Andes, about 1,000 miles south
of the capital.

   Former state Sen. Rick Lee was sentenced
today to a six-month term in a halfway house and five years'
probation for accepting a cash bribe made during a federal
``sting'' operation.
   Lee is the first lawmaker sentenced in the FBI probe of
corruption in the Statehouse.
   U.S. District Judge Falcon Hawkins said the light sentence was
given to the Boiling Springs Republican because of his cooperation
in the FBI sting. Hawkins could have sentenced Lee to up to
27-months in prison under federal sentencing guidelines.
   ``I'm very appreciative of the judge's sentencing and the work
my attorney did,'' said Lee, 37.
   Ex-Rep. Luther Taylor, snared in the FBI probe ``Operation Lost
Trust,'' was scheduled to be sentenced later today. Taylor,
D-Columbia, faced a maximum 120 years in prison and $1.5 million
fine.
   U.S. Attorney Bart Daniel, in court papers filed last week,
recommended that Lee get a lighter sentence than federal guidelines
mandated because he has cooperated with the government in the
continuing probe of corruption.
   Daniel asked for harsher treatment of Taylor, arguing that
Taylor's crimes were so severe that he warranted extra punishment.
He did not recommend a sentence.
   The federal probe has led to bribery charges against nine
lawmakers and drug charges against a tenth lawmaker and a
Statehouse lobbyist.
   Lee and three other former legislators pleaded guilty to
accepting money from a lobbyist, working undercover for the FBI, to
support a bill legalizing betting on horse racing and dog racing in
South Carolina. The four all had resigned from the legislature when
they were indicted in August.
   A fifth ex-legislator pleaded guilty to a cocaine charge and
also awaits sentencing.
   Taylor, meanwhile, contested the bribery charges; a jury
convicted him in October.
   Four other House members await trials later this month and in
January. Three won re-election to the House in November; the fourth
decided not to run.

   Five soldiers and three civilians died in the
Uzbekistan city of Namagan over the weekend during several hours of
violence touched off by a clash between youths and troops returning
from leave, Tass said today.
   Elsewhere, four Azerbaijani policemen were killed, three wounded
and two reported missing on Sunday in the troubled border region
between the republics of Azerbaijan and Armenia, Tass reported
today. It said the policemen were attacked by Armenian fighters,
three of whom were killed and two wounded.
   In Uzbekistan, Namagan Mayor Erkin Mamakulov said six soldiers
returning to their unit on a city bus Sunday night were harassing
young women passengers and demanding the bus change its route. He
said the soldiers were drunk.
   Tass said the bus driver agreed to change routes, but was
stopped by a crowd which surrounded the bus and began to beat the
soldiers. Four of them died, the official Soviet news agency said.
   When news of the incident reached the soldiers' battalio in the
Central Asian republic, its commander, Maj. V. Tezikov, set off for
the site with a group of unarmed soldiers, Tass said.
   The crowd, which Tass said had swollen to more than 3,000
people, set the bus of fire and threw stones and metal rods. The
troops, unable to reach the bus, called for armed reinforcements
who were backed up by 700 policemen, some of whom were forced to
use their weapons, it said.
   A fifth soldier was killed along with three civilians, Tass
said. Twenty-nine soldiers and 22 policemen were injured, some
seriously, it said.
   Regarding the other unrest, Tass said Interior Ministry troops
were sent today to the scene of the violence, the village of
Martunashen in Azerbaijan's Khanlar district northwest of the
disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region.
   Armenians and Azerbaijanis have been clashing for nearly three
years over control of Nagorno-Karabakh, a predominantly Armenian
region inside Azerbaijan's borders. More than 220 people have been
killed.
   Armenian has demanded control, but Azerbaijan has refused,
prompting intermittent strikes, boycotts and violence. Interior
Ministry troops have repeatedly been dispatched to restore order.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. defense secretary today told lawmakers that Kuwait
would not satisfy Saddam Hussein's ``appetite for conquest.'' The
Iraqi president again linked the Palestinian question with Iraq's
occupation of Kuwait.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said in Washington that the United
States could not wait indefinitely for economic sanctions to drive
Iraq out of Kuwait.
   ``Despite the pain he is inflicting on his own people, there is
no indication that Saddam Hussein is open to a peaceful resolution
of the problem he has created,'' Cheney told the Senate Armed
Services Committee.
   The United States cannot trust Saddam when ``he tells us his
intentions are benign,'' Cheney said. ``If he gets away with
swallowing Kuwait, his appetite for conquest will hardly be
satisfied.''
   His testimony followed statements from former U.S. military
officials and several U.S. lawmakers urging that the United States
give economic sanctions against Iraq more time to take effect.
   Meanwhile, U.S. and British military officials said Iraq tested
surface-to-surface missiles on Sunday. The missiles, which have a
range of 400 miles, were fired and landed within Iraqi territory.
   Cheney said Iraq fitted similar missiles with conventional
warheads during its war with Iran, but the missiles also could
carry chemical warheads.
   In an interview broadcast Sunday by a French television network,
Saddam said the chances of war in the Persian Gulf stand at
``50-50,'' with the outcome depending on the discussions between
his government and Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   President Bush, in the latest initiative to end the Iraqi
occupation of Kuwait, offered on Friday to send Baker to Baghdad
and the Iraqis accepted.
   Saddam did not respond to the French reporters' questions about
the possibility of an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait.
   But he said the ``dialogue'' with Baker would have to deal with
Israel's withdrawal from the territories occupied by Israel in the
1967 Middle East war - lands where most residents are Palestinians.
The United States has rejected any such linkage.
   ``If they want to make this meeting a real path toward dialogue,
then we are closer to peace,'' Saddam said.
   ``But if they want to make this meeting nothing other than a
formal exhibition for the American Congress, the American people or
international public opinion, simply to give themselves good
conscience to say, `There, we've tried to dialogue with Iraq,
without Iraq renouncing its positions' - in that case, we're closer
to war.''
   Some U.S. observers have said Bush's offer to hold talks with
Iraq was lip service for critics who say his administration is
moving too quickly toward war. The U.N. Security Council, in a
resolution Thursday, authorized force against Iraq if Saddam does
not withdraw his troops from Kuwait by Jan. 15.
   The United States has about 240,000 troops among the
350,000-strong force in the gulf region. By next month, the number
of U.S. soldiers in the force assembled against Iraq is expected to
swell to around 400,000.
   U.S. Marines began a four-day amphibious exercise Sunday, the
fourth since Operation Desert Shield began after the occupation of
Kuwait on Aug. 2. Military officials refused to dislose the
location of the practice landings, the number of Marines involved
or whether forces from other countries took part.
   Also Sunday, U.S. Energy Secretary James Watkins met with Saudi
Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, to
discuss plans to expand Saudi oil production and to keep prices
from skyrocketing in the case of war.
   A U.S. Embassy official in Riyadh said today that the United
States will use its nearly 600 million barrel strategic petroleum
reserve to stabilize oil prices in the event of war.
   ``They discussed U.S. plans to use strategic petroleum reserves
in case hostilities broke out and a real shortage emerged,'' said
the diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``People tend to
panic when a conflict breaks out, but we'll do whatever we can to
maintain stability.''
   Crude oil prices doubled to around $40 a barrel soon after
Iraq's invasion, but have fallen to as low as $29 since. If war
breaks out, they could shoot up as high as $100 a barrel, according
to estimates by oil officials.
   The plane carrying former heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad
Ali and 17 former hostages made an emergency landing in Amman,
Jordan, today after developing technical problems shortly after
takeoff. The jet departed for New York again after about seven
hours on the ground.
   A spokesman said Ali plans to return to Baghdad on Christmas Eve
to seek freedom for other hostages. The 15 American hostages and
two Canadian hostages with Ali left Iraq on Sunday.
   The Americans had been among those foreigners held at strategic
sites in Iraq to deter an attack by the U.S.-led multinational
force.

   Israeli-allied militiamen today killed five
Lebanese guerrillas in a firefight in Israel's self-proclaimed
security zone in southern Lebanon, army officials said.
   There were no casualties among fighters of the Israeli-financed
South Lebanon Army militia, army officials said.
   The guerrillas first fired a number of rocket-propelled grenades
at a position of the militia 1,000 yards northwest of Alman, which
is five miles northwest of Israel.
   The Israel-backed fighters returned fire and began a three-hour
chase up the Litani River estuary that ended in a battle in which
four of the guerrillas were killed and a fifth died later of
wounds, military sources said.
   The guerrillas were armed with the Soviet-designed Klashnikov
assault rifles and two rocket-propelled grenade launchers, the army
officials said.
   Artillery duels rocked the region during the chase, the
officials said.
   They said the guerrillas apparently belonged to a Lebanese
branch of the Baath party and the Lebanese Resistance Front, which
was responsible for several suicide attacks against Israeli forces
in 1985 aimed at pushing them out of Lebanon.
   Last week, five Israeli soldiers and two Palestinian guerrillas
were killed in a clash on the eastern sector of the buffer zone.
The army said those guerrillas belonged to the Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine, a PLO faction led by George Habash.
   Israel carved out the 440 square mile security zone as a buffer
protecting its northern border against guerrilla raids in 1985,
when it withdrew the bulk of its forces from Lebanon after a
three-year occupation.
   The zone is jointly patrolled by Israeli soldiers and some 2,700
members of the mostly Christian South Lebanon Army.

   House Republicans re-elected their leadership
team today in voting marked by the deep divisions and frustrations
that come from being the minority party for more than three
decades.
   House Minority Leader Robert Mchel of Illinois and Whip Newt
Gingrich of Georgia were re-elected to the No. 1 and No. 2 jobs
without opposition when the 167 Republicans assembled in the
cavernous Cannon Caucus Room. The terms last two years.
   Then, in a toughly fought contest for Republican Conference
chairman, the No. 3 leadership post, incumbent Jerry Lewis of
California defeated challenger Carl Pursell of Michigan, 98-64.
   And in a bitter contest for chairman of the party's House
campaign arm, National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman
Guy Vander Jagt of Michigan survived a challenge by Rep. Don
Sundquist of Tennessee, 98-66.
   It has been 36 years since any Republican in the House of
Representatives could call a hearing to order, preside over the
chamber, or take primary credit for a piece of legislation.
   House Republicans suffered an additional indignity and stepped
up their renewed infighting when their already small numbers were
reduced further by last month's elections.
   ``There is a big feeling that we just have to get a broom in
there and sweep the place out,'' said one six-term Republican,
speaking only on condition of anonymity. ``But there are others who
feel a bloodletting is not what we need.''
   The two hotly fought contests are symptoms of ``the same mood
which gripped the electorate (in this year's campaign) - throw the
rascals out,'' said another senior GOP lawmaker. Few Republicans
wanted to be interviewed on the subject, and those who did insisted
on anonymity.
   Both contests also pointed out a deeper division within the
party, one that splits House Republicans from the White House. When
Bush wants to win a fight on Capitol Hill, he most often goes to
the Senate, where the numbers are less stacked against him.
   ``They see themselves manipulated and taken advantage of by
their own White House, and condescended to by the Democrats,'' said
Norman Ornstein, a longtime Congress-watcher at the American
Enterprise Institute, a conservative Washington think tank.
   The split with the White House widened in the year's battles
over the federal budget. Many House Republicans felt left in the
lurch by Bush when he abandoned the no-new-taxes pledge that helped
elect him in 1988.
   Gingrich led a group of renegade House Republicans against the
president. The congressional committee's chief political operative,
Ed Rollins, advised candidates to run against Bush's budget. Lewis
stuck with the White House, but Pursell did not.
   Those familiar with the Byzantine world of House party politics
say White House anger over that move along with a number of
rivalries were at work in today's contests.
   Others pointed to the relatively poor performance of Vander
Jagt's committee over the past decade.
   Despite GOP domination of the White House and the expenditure of
millions of dollars, Republicans have won more than 50 House seats
that they have later lost back to the Democrats.
   This year, the GOP lost a net of eight seats, giving the
Democrats a 100-member majority. Coupled with mixed results in
governor's races and in state legislatures, the result was
disappointing in a year when the party had hoped for gains that
would give them an advantage when House seats are reapportioned
before the 1992 elections.

<TEXT>
   President Hussain Muhammad Ershad,
beset by increasingly violent opposition protests, offered today to
resign before presidential elections next year and to lift a state
of emergency.
   The 60-year-old former army general said on state-run television
he was willing to resign 45 days before the election, scheduled for
June. The opposition demanded that he step down immediately instad.
   ``He has not announced any time frame for the elections and thus
he intends to buy time to hoodwink the opposition. This is not
acceptable,'' said Kamal Haider, spokesman for the country's major
opposition alliances.
   The opposition had said previous elections were rigged and had
demanded that Ershad quit to allow a caretaker government to
supervise the balloting.
   The president said in his television address that he would
revoke the 6-day-old state of emergency on Dec. 16. Under it, civil
liberties have been suspended, including the right to assemble in
public places.
   He said also he was willing to dissolve Parliament, now
dominated by his party, and hold elections when the presidential
vote is held.
   Ershad, who seized power in a 1982 coup, had denounced the
campaign against him as an ``attempt to destroy the national
economy.''
   His surprise offer to step aside came hours after security
forces in Bangladesh's second-largest city, Chittagong, opened fire
on students hurling homemade bombs. Reporters in the port city said
at least 50 people were hurt in the clash.
   The government says six people have died throughout the country
since the state of emergency was imposed, but opposition leaders
put the death toll at 75. They say 3,000 people have been wounded
and 5,000 arrested.
   In the past, some opposition claims have been exaggerated, while
some government tolls have been understated. Because of chaos and
poor communications, independent verification has not been
possible.
   Earlier today, the government lifted censorship that was imposed
with the state of emergency, the Information Ministry said in
telexes sent to news offices. It said the move was due to ``the
improvement of overall situation in the country.''
   All newspapers, including those owned by the government, stopped
publishing when the state of emergency was declared because
journalists refused to work under censorship. There was no
immediate word on when they would resume publication.
   On Sunday, censorship was eased for four international news
agencies, including The Associated Press, but correspondents were
cautioned to remain objective.
   The curfew ordering people to stay indoors was imposed in
Chittagong, Dhaka, Khulna and Rajshahi when the state of emergency
was declared.
   Chittagong, whose population is about 2 million, was a frequent
flashpoint between Ershad's supporters and opponents.
   The injured in Chittagong, 125 miles southeast of Dhaka,
included a policeman who lost both eyes in a bomb blast and five
other members of the security forces, reporters said.
   Today's riot began when about 1,000 students set off crude bombs
and attacked vehicles in a shopping district. The trouble occurred
during a 15-hour break in the curfew imposed as part of the state
of emergency.
   In Dhaka, a city of 7 million people, shops opened and traffic
returned to the streets with the lifting of the curfew today.
Government offices and banks lso resumed business.
   The opposition parties had called for 6 a.m. to 2 p.m.
nationwide strike every day beginning Tuesday to maintain the
pressure against Ershad. The two main opposition leaders, Sheik
Hasina and Khaleda Zia, called on government employees to resign
and for non-cooperation with Ershad's government.
   The two rival opposition leaders combined forces in October in
an attempt to oust Ershad.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and the chairman
of the Senate Armed Services Committee clashed today over whether
economic sanctions will force Iraq to withdraw its army from
Kuwait.
   Cheney, testifying at Senate hearings on the Bush
administration's Persian Gulf policy, said he saw ``no indication''
that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein is willing to settle for a
peaceful withdrawal.
   ``There is no guarantee that sanctions will force him out of
Kuwait,'' Cheney said. He insisted the United States could not
``wait indefinitely'' for the embargo to work while Saddam uses the
time to prepare for an attack.
   Cheney's comments prompted Committee Chairman Sam Nunn, a
Georgia Democrat and critic of Bush's gulf policy, to question the
administration's attitude toward sanctions.
   ``If we have a war, we're never going to know whether they would
have worked, would we?'' he asked Cheney.
   ``That's the major point here. The way you find out if sanctions
are going to work is to give them enough time to work,'' Nunn said.
   Cheney said Nunn was assuming that sanctions will work if given
enough time.
   ``That's a big assumption,'' Cheney said. ``There's a big
difference between saying we know if we use military force we can
achieve our objectives (and) it may be, if we wait a year or two,
economic sanctions will get him out of Kuwait as well.''
   Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, were the first administration officials to appear before the
committee following President Bush's dramatic announcement Friday
that he was sending Secretary of State James A. Baker III to Bagdad
to meet with Saddam.
   Cheney, responding to Democratic pleas to give the sanctions
more time to work, said ``there are consequences, costs to our
coalition partners and to the country.
   ``It isn't a clean, clear-cut choice,'' Cheney said.
   He said the United States cannot trust Saddam when ``he tells us
his intentions are benign.''
   ``Despite the pain he is inflicting on his own people, there is
no indication that Saddam Hussein is open to a peaceful resolution
of the problem he has created,'' Cheney told the committee.
   ``If he gets away with swallowing Kuwait, his appetite for
conquest will hardly be satisfied,'' Cheney said.
   Cheney's testimony came on the heels of statements from former
U.S. military officials and several lawmakers that Bush should
allow the United Nations sanctions more time to take effect before
opting for war.
   The same fears were expressed today.
   ``I'm concerned that we don't have a consensus here in this
country that would support a war,'' said Sen. Robert C. Byrd,
D-W.Va., a member of the panel and president pro tem of the Senate.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, voiced misgivings about the ``Chicken
Little approach to our policy. The sky is falling and the only
option is war.''
   The defense secretary defended Bush's decision to send an
additional 200,000 troops to the gulf region last month to supplant
the more than 240,000 in the area.
   He also said additional deployments are possible and the
question of troop rotation has been put aside for now.
   ``We have not put any upper limit on deployments and we are
basing our strength in the region on the advice of the commanders
on the scene and the ever increasing size of Iraq's forces in
Kuwait,'' Cheney said.
   Nunn said the question is whether Iraq will leave without a war
or following a war.
   ``The real debate in Congress and the country is whether to
punish Iraq slowly'' or with military action, Nunn said.
   Cheney refused to back down from his position that sanctions
alone is not the answer.
   ``Such a policy would give Saddam a long breathing space in
which he could concentrate his efforts,'' the defense secretary
said. ``Because he could ignore the possibility of military option,
he could use the breathing space to work around the embargo, break
up the alliance, enhance his military strength in Kuwait and move
ahead on his nuclear weapons program.''
   The United Nations has called for Iraq to leave Kuwait, restore
the legitimate government to that oil-rich emirate and free all
Western hostages. Baker plans to travel to Baghdad between now and
Jan. 15 to meet with Saddam.
   On Friday, Bush announced his latest initiative aimed at finding
a peaceful solution to the gulf crisis before Jan. 15, the deadline
the U.N. Security Council has set for Iraq to leave Kuwait. After
that the U.N. resolution grants the right to use force against
Iraq.
   Bush announced Baker's trip to Iraq and invited Iraqi Foreign
Minister Tariq Aziz to Washington to meet with the president.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said today that
plans are going ahead to arrange the meetings although the United
States still does not have an official reply from Iraq about
whether it accepts the proposal.
   Nonetheless, preliminary, informal talks are under way to
discuss scheduling. Ms. Tutwiler said negotiators have agreed that
any talks will be bilateral discussions between the United States
and Iraq without the participation of other U.S. allies.
   As he left Washington Sunday evening for South America, Bush
declined to respond directly to reporters' questions about details
of pending talks. ``I'm very pleased with the way it's going, but
we'll see,'' was his only response.

   Trouble with the $150 million Astro
observatory today delayed Columbia astronauts' scientific research,
and as the hours ticked by scientists said some planned
observations would not be made.
   ``There's a definite loss as we go,'' said mission scientist Ted
Gull. ``Some objects are just going to slip off the list.''
   Despite hours of efforts that stretched into early afternoon,
NASA officials had trouble calibrating the observatory's instrument
pointing system, which affects all three ultraviolet telescopes.
Another problem, involving a computer that controls the movements
of one telescope, was solved, however.
   Mission manager Jack Jones said another star tracker on board,
attached to one of the telescopes, will be used to point the
telescopes if the main pointing system continues to malfunction.
The instrument is more awkward to operate, however, since it is
desigened for another purpose.
   ``Whichever one of these we demonstrate can work first, our plan
is to immediately go into that mode of operation and start
gathering science,'' he said.
   The Astro had been expected to look at about 250 high-energy
objects, including stars, quasars, galaxies, Jupiter, a supernova
and Comet Levy. The ultraviolet light and X-rays emitted from these
objects cannot be seen by ground-based instruments because they are
unable to penetrate the Earth's atmosphere. Because at least half a
day of work has now been lost, that number will be trimmed,
officials said.
   ``Sure we're disappointed, but we knew this was a crucial step
and might go slower than we planned,'' said Arthur Code, a
University of Wisconsin scientist who helped design one of the
telescopes.
   Columbia blasted into orbit early Sunday on a mission that was
originally scheduled to fly in 1986 but was postponed by the
Challenger explosion. Hydrogen leaks forced three launch delays
earlier this year, and a telescope problem halted a fourth
countdown.
   Columbia's crew, finally in orbit after a six-month delay, spent
most of the day Sunday testing the hhree ultraviolet telescopes
that will be aimed at quasars, stars and other high-energy objects
during the 10-day mission.
   Although the astronauts hoped to make their first scientific
observations today, NASA ground controllers first had to fix the
instrument pointing system. The main problem was that the star
trackers were over-sensitive to light.
   University of Wisconsin scientists and engineers, meanwhile,
activated a spare on-board computer that controls the movements of
the school's ultraviolet telescope, and the computer was working
well. The primary experiment computer crashed Sunday while software
was being loaded.
   The mission is the first shuttle flight in five years dedicated
solely to scientific research. Columbia's flight also is the third
mission in as many months - a pace the shuttle program has not
achieved since 1985.
   ``We were so used to not getting it off, the idea that it's
actually been launched and it's up there orbiting the Earth is
amazing,'' said Arthur Davidsen of Johns Hopkins University,
principal investigator for one of the telescopes.
   The brilliant night liftoff also was a boost to NASA, which has
endured a year of problems with leaky shuttles and the flawed
Hubble Space Telescope.
   ``It sure goes a long way to erase the disappointments we had
this summer,'' launch director Bob Sieck said.
   During the mission, the seven-member crew is working in shifts
so the observatory can be manned continuously. An X-ray telescope
is being operated by computer commands relayed from Goddard Space
Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.
   Using one of the ultraviolet telescopes during a test Sunday
night, the crew focused on the ``first light'' - a star called Beta
Doradus that was selected for testing purposes, not scientific
observation.
   ``That is a real star folks,'' astronaut Samuel Durrance
reported to scientists at Marshall Space Flight Center in
Huntsville, Ala.
   Scientists will use the observatory to measure ultraviolet and
X-ray radiation.
   Meanwhile, a computer terminal in the flight deck was turned off
Sunday after Columbia commander Vance Brand smelled something
burning. It was believed to have overheated.
   Also on Sunday, a Soviet rocket blasted into space with two
cosmonauts and a Japanese journalist who will join two other men at
space station Mir. That puts a total of 12 people in space, the
most at one time.
   Columbia's astronauts hope to communicate with the Soviet crew
by ham radio.

   Comedians Chevy Chase and Steve Martin took
turns holding down a giant Casper the Friendly Ghost balloon as the
pair helped singer Paul Simon make a new music video.
   The 4{-minute video filmed Saturday will feature the comics
clowning amid the floats and baton twirlers in the Jaycees
Christmas parade. The video will accompany a single from Simon's
latest album, ``Rhythm of the Saints.''
   Martin signed just one autograph, to Carrie Cheeley, an
8-year-old baton twirler.
   ``This certifies that you have had a personal encounter with me
and that you found me warm, polite, intelligent and funny,'' Martin
wrote.
   The trio marched a few blocks through downtown with the
Shriners' Acca Temple Oriental Band, then rode a float the
remainder of the parade.
   Simon's album is No. 5 on Billboard magazine's album chart.

   BRISTOL, England (AP) - Actor Paul Newman will provide the
initial funding for a British summer camp for children with cancer,
a charity official said Monday.
   Bob Woodward, chairman of the Cancer and Leukaemia in Childhood
Trust, said the project would cost up to $15.5 million.
   Newman would provide a large undisclosed cash sum through his
gourmet food company, Newman's Own Foods, which gives all profits
to charity, said Woodward. The balance of the money needed would be
raised through a national appeal.
   In the United States, Newman has established a similar camp at
Ashford, Conn. The camp is called the Hole-in-the-Wall Gang, named
after a gang of outlaws from the film ``Butch Cassidy and the
Sundance Kid,'' in which Newman starred with Robert Redford.
   It provides short holidays for 600 youngsters a year, offering a
range of activities, including canoeing, fishing, horse riding and
dancing.
   Woodward said Newman was planning similar camps in Texas and in
Florida.

   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) - Joe McIntyre of the singing group New
Kids on the Block fulfilled the fantasy of a 10-year-old heart
transplant patient by hugging her, posing with her for pictures and
signing her autograph book.
   ``My stomach feels funny,'' Nichole Duncan told her mother while
waiting for McIntyre to visit her backstage prior to a Saturday
night concert.
   Nichole, who underwent the transplant in August, wore two
buttons with McIntyre's picture and earrings that read ``I love
Joe.''
   She was taking her anti-rejection medicine when McIntyre
appeared.
   ``I love you, too,'' he told her.
   Nichole was diagnosed with heart problems as an infant and had
undergone corrective surgery and had two pacemakers before the
August operation.
   Her doctors told her the excitement of meeting McIntyre would
not hurt her heart.

   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) - Residents pulled out their wallets - and
their best dance steps - at a lively fund-raiser to help country
singer Willie Nelson pay some of his back income taxes.
   About 300 people attended the benefit Sunday night at the Broken
Spoke nightclub, where Nelson began his climb to international
stardom in the late 1960s and early '70s. Nelson was not present at
the country dancehall.
   ``He's done a lot of things for a lot of people. I think it's
great that people want to help him,'' said Will Light, a Nelson
fan.
   But while the event was expected to raise a tidy sum, with those
attending paying $10 apiece for admission, it will not cut too
deeply into Nelson's enormous tax bill. Internal Revenue Service
officials say Nelson owes them $16.7 million.
   Nelson has won five Grammys. His platinum-selling albums include
``Stardust, ``Poncho and Lefty'' and ``Red-Headed Stranger.''

   The rebel leader who overthrew President
Hissene Habre dissolved Chad's parliament and suspended the
consitution, a day after his victorious entry into the capital,
Radio Chad reported today.
   Idriss Deby, who has promised to establish a democratic
government, drove into the capital aboard a black Mercedes on
Sunday, Habre having fled after a series of military debacles.
   The announcement after a meeting of the executive committee of
Deby's Popular Salvation Movement denounced the ``economic, moral
and political chaos'' of the previous government. The radio spoke
of the ``fictive and inoperant character'' of the institutions
being dissolved or suspended.
   Earlier in the day, Deby freed at least 450 Libyan prisoners of
war. A Libyan plane left N'Djamena in late afternoon to ferry the
thin and ragged-looking prisoners home.
   Libya fought a series of wars with Habre's government before
being driven off Chadian territory in 1987.
   Habre apparently fled to Cameroon. The official Libyan news
agency, JANA, claimed Sunday that Habre had been killed. But the
state radio in Cameroon, Chad's western neighbor, reported Monday
that Habre and eight of his ministers had taken refuge in northern
Cameroon.
   French government officials also said they had information that
Habre was alive.
   Deby, 38, was Habre's chief aide in a 1982 coup but broke with
him last year and formed a rebel movement. Habre claimed that Libya
funded Deby's rebellion, but the Libyans and Deby denied it.
   Before dissolving the National Assembly, Deby met with Alingue
Bawayeu, president of the body, who acts as interim president
according to the constitution, adopted Dec. 10, 1989.
   Members of the rebels' Patriotic Salvation Movement received
other high-ranking officials of the deposed government.
   Sources close to the talks said Deby hoped to calm fears of a
purge and instill confidence in the future. He has promised
multiparty democracy.
   Rebels in all-terrain vehicles mounted with machine guns zoomed
through the city today, spreading their control from key
administrative buildings to working-class neighborhoods.
   After entering the capital, Deby said he wanted to end the civil
strife that has ravaged Chad for the past decade and declared that
he would institute a democracy.
   ``My worry is not to be president of the republic,'' he said.
``This country must become democratic, pluralist. The moment has
come to lay down our arms.''
   Earlier this year, Habre organized the country's first contested
election in its 30 years as an independent state, but candidates
were limited to independents and members of his ruling party. He
was re-elected to a seven-year term.
   Deby urged reconciliation with Goukouni Oueddei, the president
he and Habre toppled in 1982. Goukouni is exiled in Libya.
   Three companies of Foreign Legion soldiers landed Sunday in
N'Djamena to reinforce France's total troop strength in its former
colony to 1,800 men. The capital was pillaged Saturday after Habre
and his troops fled.
   The legionnaires organized the evacuation of 948 foreigners to
Paris on two flights Sunday. Most of the evacuees were French, but
about 50 American dependents were on the flights.
   France has deployed soldiers in Chad under a defense treaty.
They have taken no part in the fighting, which Paris views as a
Chadian affair.
   On Saturday, the legionnaires organized the remaining Chadian
government troops to impose an overnight curfew and disarm looters,
mainly renegades or civilians who had picked up weapons thrown down
by army deserters.
   There were no immediate reports of deaths in the rebel takeover,
but the French relief agency Doctors Without Borders said it
treated 120 people hurt in rioting.
   About 1,000 civilians cheered Deby as his Mercedes-led motorcade
pulled into the Place des Martyrs, the central square in the city
of 400,000 people. Others waved and cried out from the streets.
   No details were disclosed, but the talks were presumed to
concern a handover of power in this North African country of about
5.2 million people.
   There were conflicting reports about the fate of Habre and his
Cabinet.
   The Libyan news agency JANA said he was killed near the Sudanese
border, but diplomats and other sources said Habre and his family
flew in a military plane early Saturday to Maroua, Cameroon, about
185 miles west of N'Djamena.
   Neither report could be independently verified.
   Libya, which occupied two-thirds of Chad in 1980 and occupied
parts of the north before being driven out in 1987, denied any
involvement in Deby's offensive.
   But JANA called Habre a ``brigand'' and hailed the victory of
the rebels.
   ``Habre was an obstacle in the way of national reconciliation
between Chadians and an obstacle to good neighborliness and the
bonds of history and common suffering between Libyans and
Chadians,'' JANA said in the commentary.
   Deby, a brilliant military tactician, broke the morale of
government troops in a three-week campaign that culminated Thursday
when the rebels captured Abeche, a town of 30,000 people about 500
miles east of N'Djamena.

<HEAD>Environmental Compromise Clears Way for Alaskan Oilfield Project</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government and oil
producers have resolved an environmental dispute that had stalled
production at part of a vast Alaskan oilfield near Prudhoe Bay.
   The Army Corps of Engineers, the main opponent of the project,
agreed Friday to a plan in which Arco, BP Exploration and Exxon
would spend an estimated $50 million in the drilling area to ease
fish migration in the Beaufort Sea.
   The agreement clears the way for production to begin within two
years at the Point McIntyre field, where the oil companies own
rights to an estimated 300 million barrels. Production from Point
McIntyre and the nearby Lisburne field could reach 100,000 barrels
a day by 1994, said Al Greenstein, a spokesman at Arco's
headquarters in Los Angeles.
   ``Our agreement recognizes that environmental quality and
economic reality are both important in North Slope oil and gas
decisions,'' said Col. William W. Kakel, Alaska district engineer
for the Corps.
   Officials from the Energy Department helped mediate the dispute
in an effort to increase domestic oil output to help make up for
the loss of 200,000 barrels a day of Kuwaiti oil following the Aug.
2 Iraqi invasion.
   Production had been delayed because of concerns that existing
gravel causeways that extended from land into the Beaufort Sea
threatened fish that migrate in the coastal waters of northern
Alaska. The roadbeds were built for exploration drilling at the
Point McIntyre field and the nearby Endicott field.
   Federal officials said the causeways appeared to raise salt
concentrations and the water temperature to levels that could be
harmful to the Arctic char, broad whitefish and other fish relied
upon by commercial fishermen.
   Oil industry officials have said years of monitoring programs on
the causeways did not indicate any adverse effects to the fish.
   But they agreed to spend $50 million to clear several water
passages in the gravel roadbeds. The agreement calls for 650
additional feet of openings in the Prudhoe Bay West Dock and
Endicott gravel causeways.
   The agreement enables oil companies to move ahead with
production and avoids years of dispute and possible litigation,
said Brian Davies, a vice president for development at BP.
   The causeway work could take as long as five years, said BP
spokesman Paul Laird.
   Output at the Lisburne field, which is already in production, is
40,000 barrels a day. Greenstein said the combined output from the
Lisburne and Point McIntyre fields will exceed 60,000 barrels a day
when output from Point McIntyre begins by late summer in 1992, and
could 100,000 barrels a day after a planned expansion in 1993.
   About 1.3 million barrels a day are produced each day from
Prudhoe Bay fields.

<TEXT>
   Record government spending pumped up the value
of new construction projects 1.3 percent in October, despite the
smallest outflow for residential housing in 4{ years, the
government said Monday.
   ``The (private) building side is still very weak and still
declining,'' said economist Daryl Delano of Cahners Economics in
Newton, Mass. ``If not for government spending, we'd be talking
about a very bleak picture.''
   The Commerce Department said overall residential,
non-residential and government spending totaled a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of $434.4 billion, up from $428.9 billion in
September. Construction spending was unchanged in August at $441.2
billion.
   But 27 percent of the October total came from government funds,
a 7.7 percent increase from September, to $117.8 billion. That
broke a $115.8 billion record set last August.
   Much of the increase was due to spending on sewer systems, up
15.5 percent; schools, up 5.7 percent, and streets and highways, up
5.5 percent.
   Spending by the often-volatile government sector had fallen 5.5
percent in September after gaining 7.1 percent the previous month.
   But private spending continued its recent weakness.
   Residential construction dropped 0.9 percent to $179.5 billion,
its seventh consecutive monthly decline and the lowest since
spending totaled $177.4 billion in March 1986. Residential spending
was off 2.5 percent in September.
   At the same time, spending on non-residential construction slid
0.8 percent to $102.0 billion, the smallest amount since $100.0
billion in new projects got under way last December.
   Overall, spending in October was just 1.2 percent above the
$429.3 billion posted in the same month last year.
   Delano attributed much of the recent weakness in the private
sector to the so-called ``credit crunch'' which both Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F.
Brady have said is causing problems for many businesses.
   The credit problem is particularly acute in the private,
non-residential sector where there ``is a lack of funding for
projects, even those projects that make reasonably good business
sense,'' Delano said.
   Some critics contend government officials are being overzealous
in interpreting banking regulations in the wake of the savings and
loan debacle. Brady has asked regulators not to be
``unrealistically negative'' in evaluating loans and urged bankers
``to keep lending to your good customers.''
   Single-family spending fell 2.0 percent to $102.8 billion after
a 3.1 percent drop in September despite a 1.0 percent increase, to
$18.7 billion, in apartment construction.
   Non-residential spending slipped 0.8 percent to $102.0 billion
following a 1.5 percent decline in September.
   ``Residential spending has been down for many, many months
now,'' Delano said. ``Non-residential just started turning down a
couple of months ago. Our forecast for all of the non-residential
sectors shows weakness continuing into next year, beyond the middle
of next year. It's pretty grim.''

   This is a golden time for Speaker Thomas S.
Foley. He has led his Democrats from upheaval to unity, has
President Bush courting on every issue, and his side will enjoy a
big 100-vote majority beginning next month.
   But what is his mandate?
   The Washington Democrat became speaker last year after former
Speaker Jim Wright resigned in an ethics storm. Foley's soothing,
low-key style was good medicine for the institution and built him a
huge reservoir of good will.
   Given the mess he inherited, he wasn't blamed for the slow pace
of legislation last year, or the sloppy way things were done this
year, and he won praise for what was accomplished in the end.
   The 102nd Congress, however, will be all his, starting with his
uncontested renomination by the Democrats on Monday.
   ``Speaker Foley came during a difficult time and I think he's
established a high level of confidence and trust. I think he has
strong bipartisan support and is an excellent speaker.'' said Rep.
Dave McCurdy, D-Okla.
   ``I think the issue is, how does he consolidate the gains he
made,'' McCurdy added.
   In the last Congress, Foley proved a patient negotiator with an
extraordinary talent for nurturing consensus. On issues ranging
from flag burning, where he outlasted demands for a constitutional
amendment, to the budget, where he and the Democrats stonewalled as
Bush's tax pledge crumbled, he smartly waited for the consensus to
move in his direction, and won.
   He seems to be utilizing those same skills as he fences with the
White House over Bush's Middle East policy.
   A protege of the late Sen. Henry ``Scoop'' Jackson, Foley
clearly understands that even if lawmakers doubt Bush, they can't
let Republicans trap them into appearing weak on defense issues.
His handling of the issue on behalf of the Democrats could help set
the tone for the new Congress.
   But the next Congress will test not only whether Foley can lead
the Democrats through the political mine fields. He'll be expected
to put new ideas for the nation's needs before his colleagues and
the nation.
   McCurdy and others say Foley needs to develop legislative
initiatives for the House that also will serve the party well in
the 1992 presidential election.
   So far, Foley has enunciated an agenda that only repeats his
desire for some of the unfinished items from the last Congress,
including campaign reform and civil rights legislation. Democratic
leaders also intend to keep pushing the economic ``fairness'' issue
they believe served the party well in the closing weeks of the last
Congress.
   Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont., a member of the Democratic
leadership, expressed confidence Foley will step out in front. The
speaker toughened politically, he said, when Foley's initial budget
deal with Bush was defeated.
   ``I think Foley became a better poker player with the help of
his Democratic colleagues when they rejected the budget agreement
they were dealt and asked for a new hand,'' he said.
   Foley's position will be stronger also because of changes he can
now make in the House leadership structure, which he couldn't make
midstream. Murky to the outside world, they are nonetheless
important.
   New lawmakers will be beholden to him for their committee
assignments, the new Democratic campaign chief is his pick, and he
gets to replace Wright holdovers and appoint a big portion of the
party's policy-making committee in the House.
   Foley's toughest challenge may be to temper his natural tendency
to let issues come to him, since there's no way to make sure the
most vocal message-carriers represent the party's best interests.
   The left-wing ``screamers'' and the one-issue Democrats need to
let Foley steer a mainstream course, and to ``let Foley be Foley,''
said McCurdy, who promised he and other moderates would make sure
they were in Foley's face as often as the others were.
   No one expects Foley to change stripes, to be anything but his
cautious, compromising, intellectual self. The real question is
whether he will be expansive, whether he will go beyond sorting
through competing suggestions for curing the nation's ills and
develop them and push them to fruition.
   With world and domestic events moving so quickly, he'll start
providing answers soon after the new Congress begins on Jan. 3.

   Former East German leader Erich Honecker insists
he is not guilty of charges that he issued shoot-to-kill orders at
the Berlin Wall, his lawyer said Monday.
   For the third straight day, Soviet officials blocked the arrest
of Honecker, who has taken refuge at a Soviet military hospital in
the woods south of Berlin. Soviet doctors believe he is seriously
ill, an interpreter said.
   Berlin justice officials issued an arrest warrant Friday, two
days before a united Germany held its first free elections in 58
years. They said they based the warrant on new documents recently
uncovered that incriminate Honecker.
   Honecker faces charges that he signed shoot-to-kill orders at
the Berlin Wall, the border between former East and West Germany.
   But German police cannot arrest Honecker without Soviet
permission to enter the hospital, which is guarded by armed
soldiers. The Soviets have indicated they are holding their former
ally on humanitarian grounds.
   In Moscow, Foreign Ministry spokesman Vitaly Churkin told a news
conference, ``Nobody knows what will happen with Honecker and how
the situation will be resolved.''
   ``The decision to get Mr. Honecker to a Soviet hospital had to
do with his state of health and we would like to believe that the
German side ... will also be guided first of all by principles of
humanism,'' Churkin said.
   The warrant specifically links Honecker to the deaths of four
people killed while trying to flee his repressive regime before it
was toppled in last year's peaceful revolution. About 200 people
died trying to escape from East Germany during the 28-year
existence of the Berlin Wall.
   Wolfgang Ziegler, one of Honecker's defense lawyers, told the
ADN news agency that his client insisted he was not guilty.
   The agency said Ziegler had lodged a protest against the arrest
warrant on grounds that Honecker cannot be punished for alleged
crimes committed under East German laws. The East German legal
system ceased to exist when the former Communist state acceded to
West Germany on Oct. 3 and West German laws took effect.
   Honecker, 78, was transferred earlier Monday to a cardiology
unit at the Soviet military hospital in Beelitz, 20 miles south of
Berlin. He took refuge there in April.
   ADN quoted a Soviet interpreter as saying Red Army doctors
considered Honecker's condition ``serious.'' One doctor diagnosed
Honecker as having high blood pressure, the agency quoted Igor
Molotkin, the interpreter, as saying.
   Honecker's lawyers maintain that he is too sick to stand trial.
   German justice officials say they have no way of verifying
Honecker's state of health until the Soviets let them into the
hospital.
   An official at the Soviet Embassy in Bonn on Monday refused to
comment on a report that talks were under way between German and
Soviet officials on handing over Honecker, whose testimony could be
potentially damaging to Moscow.
   Honecker, in coments published in November by The European, a
British weekly newspaper, complained that he was brought down from
power by ``intriguers.''
   Later the same month, he said he was toppled on Oct. 18, 1989,
because of a Soviet conspiracy, according to a report published in
the Berlin Wochenpost weekly newspaper.
   The Soviet Union and the other three victorious World War II
powers relinquished special rights over the two German states in
agreements that restored German sovereignty.
   But the Oct. 12 German-Soviet agreement on the withdrawal of Red
Army forces stationed in eastern Germany assures the Soviets
control of their military bases.

<HEAD>Portuguese Surrealist Painter Antonio Dacosta Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Painter and art critic Antonio Dacosta,
who introduced surrealism to Portugal and became one of the
country's leading artists, has died. He was 76.
   Dacosta died Sunday in a hospital in Paris, where he had lived
intermittently since 1947. The cause of death was not given.
   President Mario Soares on Monday called Dacosta ``a personality
without equal in Portuguese culture. A painter of extraordinary
resources and a most fine sensibility.''
   Born in the Azores island town of Angra do Heroismo in 1914,
Dacosta moved to Lisbon at 21 to study art. He was inspired by
French and Spanish surrealists, especially the Spanish artist
Salvador Dali.
   Dacosta held the first surrealist exhibition in Portugal in
1940.
   In 1949, he abandoned painting to work as a journalist and art
critic in Paris for Portuguese and Brazilian newspapers.
   Dacosta returned to painting in 1975.
   His early works showed a dramatic, fluid use of forms and
colors. Later works were more abstract with gentler color use,
influenced by the rural landscapes of the Azores.
   A major retrospective of his work was held to critical acclaim
at Lisbon's Calouste Gulbenkian Museum in 1988.
   Dacosta is survived by his wife, Miriam, and their two children.
   Funeral plans were not immediately announced.

<HEAD>`Consumer Reports' Asks FDA To Halt Sale</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The publisher of Consumer Reports is urging the
Food and Drug Administration to halt the sale of milk from cows
being treated with a genetically engineered growth hormone.
   Critics have repeatedly raised questions about possible health
risks associated with milk containing the hormone, but the FDA and
many others have argued that bovine growth hormone, as it's called,
has no effect on human health.
   The hormone is given to cows to boost milk production. Some
critics have argued that it could have a harmful economic effect by
boosting milk production at a time when there is no shortage of
milk.
   It has not yet been approved by the FDA. But in 1985 the agency
ruled that milk from cows treated with the hormone could be sold.
   Consumers Union, which publishes the magazine, called on the FDA
to reopen its investigation of the human safety of the hormone
while it pursues its review of the hormone's effects on animal
health.
   ``We see virtually no benefits to the average consumer from the
use of this drug,'' Michael K. Hansen, the report's author said.
``Its use is unlikely to result in lower milk prices to consumers.
In fact, its use may cost consumers tax dollars that the federal
government must spend to buy up dairy surpluses.''
   Four companies produce growth hormone: American Cyanamid, Eli
Lilly, Monsanto and Upjohn.
   In August, the FDA released a review of more than 120 studies to
support its contention that the hormone is safe for human
consumption. A week earlier, an article in the Journal of the
American Medical Association also found the hormone to be safe.
   Yet critics have continued to raise questions.
   Last week, Jeremy Rifkin, one of the most outspoken critics,
sued the National Dairy Board for what he said was illegal
promotion of the hormone before it has been approved by the FDA.
   He also petitioned the agency to ``immediately halt any
promotion of this product by FDA officials and to immediately
rescind the use of this product in the marketplace until it is
approved.''
   On Monday, he filed another petition asking the agency to halt
sales, recall milk produced by hormone-treated cows and establish a
long-term independent research program on the hormone's safety.
   William Grigg, and FDA spokesman, said the agency has determined
that the hormone is not active in humans and occurs normally in
milk in amounts comparable to those found in milk from treated
cows.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court said Monday it will decide
whether police who have an owner's permission to search a car must
get a court warrant before opening any containers inside the
vehicle.
   The justices agreed to review a Florida Supreme Court ruling
that court warrants are needed before police open containers found
in the car's interior other than in the trunk.
   In a 1982 decision, the nation's highest court ruled that police
can search even closed containers within a car's trunk any time an
officer has ``reasonable cause'' to believe the car contains drugs,
weapons or other contraband.
   No warrant is needed for such searches of containers found in
the trunk, the court said in 1982.
   The justices now must decide, probably by July, whether that
ruling applies to consentual searches conducted inside that part of
the car where the driver and passengers sit. The Florida court said
the 1982 ruling did not apply.
   The state court's ruling barred prosecutors from using as trial
evidence cocaine found by a Miami policeman in a car owned by Enio
and Luz Jimeno during a 1989 search.
   Officer Frank Trujillo became suspicious of the car driven by
Enio Jimeno and followed it until it made an illegal turn. Trujillo
then stopped the car and asked to search the inside for drugs.
   Jimeno consented, and Trujillo's search turned up a brown paper
bag on the floor on the front passenger side.
   Trujillo did not ask for permission to open the bag before doing
so, and found cocaine inside.
   A state trial judge granted the Jimenos' request to exclude the
cocaine as evidence against them, and the Florida Supreme Court
upheld that ruling.
   Attorney General Robert Butterworth then appealed, contending
that police authority to conduct warrantless car searches when
given consent is ``just as broad as a search based on warrant or
probable cause.''
   Lawyers for the Jimenos had urged the justices to reject
Butterworth's appeal.
   The case is Florida vs. Jimeno, 90-622.

<TEXT>
   A California community college accused of
unlawful censorship for blocking the on-campus performance of a
racially charged play lost a Supreme Court appeal Monday.
   The justices, without comment, rejected arguments by the college
officials that the lawsuit should be killed.
   The case raises the question of whether college administrators
have the same broad power as public high school officials to limit
freedom of speech in school-sponsored activities.
   The California dispute began in June 1986 when Alan DiBona, a
drama teacher at San Diego Commmunity College, planned a class
production of ``Split Second.''
   The play is about a black New York City police officer who
fatally shoots a white suspect after the suspect has taunted him
with racial slurs and epithets. The officer, following his
split-second loss of control, places a knife in the victim's hand
to make the shooting look like self-defense.
   DiBona planned to have the play performed at the Educational
Cultural Complex, a branch of the San Diego college. Students
auditioning for parts in the play were to receive course credit.
   Robert Matthews, president of the branch college, and James
Hardison, dean of arts and sciences there, opposed the performance.
   They said community church leaders who learned about the planned
performance were upset. The college officials also expressed
concern over profane language used in the play, saying it could
inflame racial tensions already sparked by a local murder case in
which a young black man was accused of shooting two police
officers.
   When DiBona refused to change his plans, the college cancelled
his class.
   He and his students performed ``Split Second'' off campus. None
of the students received course credit for the performance, and
DiBona was not paid by the college.
   DiBona and a student, Scott Gundlach, sued Matthews and Hardison
for allegedly violating their free-speech rights.
   A judge threw out the suit. But it was reinstated in July by a
state appeals court, which ordered a trial.
   The appeals court noted that the Supreme Court in 1988 upheld
the power of a high school principal to remove two controversial
articles from a student newspaper.
   But college students are adults, the appeals court said, adding,
``Where children are concerned the legitimate role of the
government in regulating speech is substantially broader.''

<HEAD>Police Impose Curfews on Black Townships After Weekend Violence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TINA SUSMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soldiers and heavily armed
police moved into black townships Monday and more than a
half-million blacks were under curfew after at least 78 people died
in factional fighting over the weekend.
   The worst violence was in Tokoza outside Johannesburg, where
bodies lay in the mud outside burned-out homes. Police Capt. Ida
van Zweel said 52 victims had been found there by Monday afternoon.
   It was one of the most severe cases of township fighting since
mid-August, when violence between supporters of the African
National Congress and Inkatha Freedom Party broke out in the
Johannesburg area.
   The leader of the South African Communist Party, Joe Slovo, said
Monday that if President F.W. de Klerk did not act to stop the
violence, talks between the government and ANC could be ruined. He
accused government security forces of instigating the unrest to
disrupt the talks.
   ``There's no way we can talk peace if people continue to be
killed,'' Slovo said in an interview. The Communist Party, which is
allied with the ANC, demanded the resignation of Law and Order
Minister Adriaan Vlok and Defense Minister Magnus Malan.
   Vlok late Monday declared Tokoza an unrest area and imposed a 9
p.m.-to-4 a.m. curfew. Curfews also were imposed in the nearby
townships of Katlehong, Vosloorus and Bekkersdal.
   Police reported 71 deaths in the Johannesburg area since Sunday
night: 52 in Tokoza, eight in Tembisa, six in Katlehong, and five
in Sebokeng. Another seven people died in weekend fighting in Natal
Province.
   No new deaths were reported in Vosloorus or Bekkersdal, but
clashes occurred in those townships last week.
   Police and soldiers in armored vehicles were deployed in the
townships to enforce the curfews, which affected about 650,000
people.
   About 1,000 blacks have been killed in factional fighting in
Johannesburg townships since August. Thousands more have died in
Natal Province, where the battles have raged since 1985.
   The fighting involves supporters of the Inkatha Freedom Party,
who are mostly Zulus, and Xhosas and other blacks who back the ANC.
Both groups oppose apartheid but differ on tactics for fighting it.
Inkatha favors a more conservative approach than the ANC.
   Several homes in Tokoza were attacked and burned during the
factional battles, their inhabitants hacked to death with knives
and clubs. Hundreds of men, women and children fled their homes in
terror.
   ``The Zulus came in the night,'' said one frightened Xhosa,
standing in the rain and holding a club. ``They killed our people.
We don't know why.''
   Both sides blamed the other for starting the fighting. Some
residents of Tokoza claimed Zulus were being aided by armed whites,
but they gave no evidence. Zulu leaders, meanwhile, said several of
their followers had been shot by police for no apparent reason.
   Police said all but one of the victims were black. All were
hacked, shot, or burned to death by having flaming tires thrown
around their necks.
   A white security guard was killed in Katlehong, police said. He
was one of the few white people to die in the factional fighting.

<HEAD>Lawsuit Alleges NIMH Discriminates Against Female Researchers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A female psychiatrist alleged Monday that
national health officials, criticized in the past for not including
more women in government studies, are now discriminating against
women researchers.
   Dr. Margaret Jensvold, a former medical staff fellow at the
National Institute of Mental Health, filed a federal lawsuit
contending that a male superior harassed her because she was female
and fired her in 1989 before she could complete the third year of a
fellowship program.
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Maryland, also alleged
that Jensvold was denied opportunities for research and writing
provided to male medical fellows and that a male superior tried to
destroy her academic career.
   A spokeswoman for NIMH said officials had not seen the suit and
would have no immediate comment.
   The suit said that when Jensvold worked in the Menstrually
Related Mood Disorder Clinic at NIMH, she was the only woman
physician in the program set up to study premenstrual syndrome.
   ``I was never accepted by the male physicians who were in charge
of my program,'' Jensvold said in a statement.
   She said male physicians ``constantly denigrated'' women who had
preceded her, saying they did not deserve any credit for work they
had done and that they had been pushed out because they could not
get along with male colleagues.
   Earlier this year, a study by the General Accounting Office,
Congress' investigative arm, found that the National Institutes of
Health has had little success with its four-year effort to include
more women in government research of diseases and their treatments.
   ``NIH and NIMH have recently come under serious criticism for
failing to includ  women as research subjects,'' Jensvold said.
``Now it is clear that they are also excluding women as
researchers. The effect of these two things on women's health is
very destructive.''
   The lawsuit named as defendant Louis Sullivan, secretary of the
Department of Health and Human Services. It seeks to have Jensvold
reinstated as a third-year medical fellow and awarded back pay,
benefits and other damages of at least $100,000.

<HEAD>High-Tech Equipment On Bush Trip Highlights Brazilian Restrictions
^By BRUCE HANDLER
^Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As President Bush on Monday was telling
South Americans to push for free trade and open up their economies,
hundreds of U.S. journalists covered him using equipment that -
technically - could have been seized by Brazil's federal police.
   A special press room set up here by the U.S. Embassy was a
glaring contrast to the restrictions, barriers and bureaucracy that
inhibit the use of up-to-date conveniences in Brazil and much of
South America.
   American reporters wrote their Bush stories on lightweight
lap-top computers. They filed them on portable fax machines or over
high-speed data channels, using special telephone lines connected
directly to the United States. American broadcast networks, thanks
to a huge, imported dish antenna set up in the hotel parking lot,
beamed reports directly to U.S. satellites.
   Brazil, obviously, made a special exception for the Washington
press. But under normal circumstances here, computers and faxes and
high-speed communications equipment are on a list of totally
prohibited imports.
   The idea behind the law was to prevent ``foreign imperialists''
from controlling Brazil's sophisticated technology. Many other
South American countries have similar restrictions to protect their
high-tech industries.
   Brazil, it is true, today has a $6 billion-a-year market in
computers and related equipment. And Brazilians who a decade ago
knew nothing about this field now in fact turn out sophisticated
machinery.
   But Brazilian-made computer components always seem to be a step
behind the ``state of the art'' in the United States, Japan and
Europe. And Brazilian high-tech equipment costs an outrageous
fortune.
   A year ago a Brazilian fax cost $8,000. Now you might find one
on special for $1,500, but most remain in the $2,500-$3,000 range.
In the United States they cost less than $500.
   A 14-inch color monitor for a home computer, made in Brazil and
thus for sale legally, costs $2,800. The U.S. price is $650.
   Brazil's top-of-the-line laser printer costs $20,000. A U.S.
model with the same features sells for $3,500.
   ---&equals;
   President Bush's team of senior advisers all passed up the
opportunity to travel with him on his five-nation South American
trip. So did his wife, Barbara, complaining of a sinus infection
aggravated b flying around on planes.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III stayed behind to testify
before Congress on the Persian Gulf crisis. John Sununu, the White
House chief of staff, and Brent Scowcroft, the president's national
security adviser, also remained at home and sent deputies in their
place.
   There was no official explanation for the absence of Sununu and
Scowcroft. One senior official, though, suggested that some of
Bush's advisers are becoming exhausted by his near non-stop travel,
which in recent days has included treks through Europe, the Middle
East and Mexico.
   ---&equals;
   Tropical Brazil is not known as great wine country. The little
wine that it produces is mostly grown and drunk by ethnic Italians
in southern Brazil. Other wines are exported to Europe for mixture
in popular, low-priced brands there.
   Bush avoided the Brazilian grape when he threw a luncheon for
business leaders. Instead, he reached 4,300 miles back to Virginia
to serve wines from Meredyth Vineyards: a Seyval Blanc 89 and
Vallard Noir 85.
   The rest of the menu: shrimp and avocado en beurre blanc,
supreme of chicken with cheese and herbs, almond and raisin rice,
green beans, lemon and rum mousse.

<HEAD>Realtor Survey Finds Housing More Affordable</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The typical American family's ability to buy
an existing home increased in October to its highest level in more
than two years, a real estate trade group said Monday.
   But despite falling home prices, lower mortgage interest rates
and rising family incomes, existing home sales fell 4.7 percent in
October, according the National Association of Realtors.
   ``The missing link is consumer confidence - the housing
affordability index indicates that conditions are better than
they've been in over two years,'' said Realtors president Harley E.
Rouda.
   The Realtors group said its housing affordability index rose to
113.4 in October from 110.8 the previous month. That meant a family
with a median income of $35,353 had 113.4 percent of the income
needed to qualify for conventional financing to buy a median-priced
home costing $92,800.
   The median is the point at which half of the families earned
more and half earned less, and half of the homes cost more and half
less. The median income rose $114 in October while the median price
fell $1,600. The monthly mortgage payment for the median-priced
home decreased $14 to $649.
   The index was at its highest point since it reached 113.5 in
September 1988.
   Buying conditions varied according to region, said John A.
Tuccillo, the Realtors' chief economist. In the Northeast and the
West, for instance, the typical family lacked the income necessary
to buy the median-priced home.
   In the Northeast, a family earning the median income of $41,376
had 90.1 percent of the income needed to buy a median-priced home
costing $136,200. In the West, a family with a median income of
$37,631 had 80.8 percent of the income needed to buy a
median-priced home costing $140,600.
   Families generally had more income than necessary to buy homes
in the Midwest and South where housing typically is lower-priced.
   In the Midwest, a family earning $36,127 had 147.9 percent of
the income needed to buy a $72,100 home, while a family living in
the South earning $31,795 had 112.7 percent of the income needed to
buy an $83,400 home.
   Also affecting the affordability index was a drop in the
interest rate from 10 percent in September to 9.96 percent in
October. The rate is a composite of closing rates for both

<HEAD>Actor Burt Lancaster in Serious Condition Following Stroke</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ALAMITOS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Burt Lancaster remained
hospitalized Monday for a stroke and his agent said he was in good
spirits.
   The 77-year-old film star was in serious condition at Los
Alamitos Medical Center, said agent Ben Benjamin. Lancaster has
some weakness on his right side and some slight difficulty
speaking.
   ``But he's a fighter, as his daughter (Joanna Mari) says, and
the family has every good hope that he's going to recover,''
Benjamin said.
   Doctors were expected to submit a full report on Lancaster's
condition on Tuesday or Wednesday, said Benjamin.
   Lancaster starred in more than 70 motion pictures and won an
Academy Award in 1960 for his portrayal of an evangelist in ``Elmer
Gantry.'' More recently he appeared in the film ``Field of
Dreams.''
   He sued Columbia Pictures in 1988 after the studio, citing
health insurance problems, replaced him with Gregory Peck in the
film ``The Old Gringo.''
   Lancaster was visiting a friend at the John Douglas French
Center for Alzheimer's Disease when he collapsed in a chair Friday
and was taken to the hospital.

   The military rebellion that
erupted Monday is the fourth since 1987 staged by dissident
soldiers. The others were:
   -In April 1987, about 130 officers and non-commissioned officers
led by former Lt. Col. Aldo Rico, a commando and Falklands veteran,
holed up at an infantry school in suburban Buenos Aires. Rico
sought amnesty for officers accused of human rights abuse during
the 1976-83 military regime.
   President Raul Alfonsin secured Rico's surrender, and later
pushed a law through congress that absolved most officers below the
rank of general of rights violations charges. Rico was placed under
house arrest.
   There were no deaths or serious injuries in the uprising.
   -In January 1988, Rico fled house arrest and flew to an infantry
garrison about 440 miles north of Buenos Aires. Joined by about 200
supporters, he accused the government of failing to fully meet
demands made during his first rebellion. Loyal forces surrounded
the garrison and Rico surrendered. He was imprisoned and cashiered.
   Several army generals retired and military pay was increased.
   In that uprising, two loyalist soldiers were wounded when their
truck ran over a mine.
   -In December 1988, Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin, also a commando
and Falklands veteran, took over an army arsenal in Buenos Aires,
demanding that the government recognize the army's role in ending
leftist terrorism and fighting the Falklands war. Surrounded by
loyalist forces, Seineldin and his men surrendered.
   One civilian was killed and several wounded when fired on during
a demonstration outside the occupied arsenal.
   President Carlos Menem, who took office on July 8, 1989,
pardoned Seineldin and other uprising participants. Seineldin was
forced to retire.
   He currently is serving a 60-day jail sentence, ordered after he
wrote a letter to Menem, outside the chain of command, criticizing
army leaders for failing to live up to promises made following
previous rebellions.
   Rico, released from prison, began forming a right-wing
nationalist political organization and said he planned to seek
public office.

<HEAD>Americans Spar On Ousting Iraq From Kuwait, Iraq Says Palestine
Comes First</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   As the U.S. defense secretary sparred Monday with the chairman
of the Senate Armed Service Committee over how best to drive Iraq
from Kuwait, Iraq insisted a Palestinian homeland was the issue to
be decided first.
   President Bush, meanwhile, departed from a prepared text to
assail Saddam Hussein.
   ``I realize the sacrifces that Saddam (Hussein's) brutality has
caused this nation,'' Bush told lawmakers in Brazil on Monday. He
estimated high oil prices resulting from the Persian Gulf crisis
are costing Brazil $5 billion annually - a figure local experts
said seemed excessive.
   Bush, after winning U.N. authorization last week for a military
strike against Iraq unless it quits Kuwait by Jan. 15, offered to
send his secretary of state to Baghdad to negotiate.
   Iraq agreed to talk. But Monday, Iraq again insisted the
Palestinian people must have a homeland in the West Bank and Gaza,
with Jerusalem as its capital, before any other Middle East peace
questions can be dealt with.
   ``The first question is Palestine,'' Iraqi delegate Adnan Malik
told the U.N. General Assembly. ``Palestine comes first, Palestine
comes second and Palestine comes third.''
   The United States has rejected any linkage of the Palestine
issue to Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait. Israel has occupied the
West Bank and Gaza Strip since seizing control of the territories
in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told the Senate committee on
Monday the administration was pessimistic about economic sanctions
bringing an end to Iraq's 4-month-old occupation of Kuwait.
   ``Given the nature of the regime, given Saddam Hussein's
brutality to his own people, his very tight control of that
society, his ability to allocate resources for the military, their
ability to produce their own food ... he can ride them out,''
Cheney said.
   ``It is far better for us to deal with him now ... than it will
be for us to deal with him five or 10 years from now, when ...
Saddam has become an even better armed and more threatening
regional superpower than he is at present,'' the defense secretary
said.
   He said he saw no indication Saddam was willing to settle the
dispute.
   Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., questioned
the Bush administration's attitude toward economic sanctions.
   ``If we have a war, we're never going to know whether they would
have worked, would we?'' he asked Cheney.
   ``That's the major point here. The way you find out if sanctions
are going to work is to give them enough time to work,'' Nunn said.
   In Saudi Arabia, some U.S. forces reportedly were on heightened
alert. Some troops donned gas masks and protective gloves against a
possible chemical weapons strike at the same time Iraq test-fired
missiles on Sunday, a correspondent with the NBC Radio network
said.
   The heightened alert reportedly went into effect early Thursday
and was the highest alert since Iraq seized Kuwait on Aug. 2. But
it was not a war alert, U.S. military officers said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Iraq test-fired Soviet-type Scud missiles - which could be used
to carry chemical weapons - on Sunday, the U.S. military said. The
military said the flight path was away from the U.S.-led
multinational force in eastern Saudi Arabia.
   A jetliner carrying boxing great Muhammad Ali and some former
American and Canadian hostages returned to the Jordanian capital
Monday shortly after taking off for New York. The plane turned
around because of minor technical problems but resumed its flight
about seven hours later, officials said.
   Also Monday, the British Foreign Office reported Iraq has
detained four more British men who had been in hiding in Kuwait.
The Foreign Office said there were 440 Britons hiding in Kuwait and
an estimated 740 Britons in Iraq.
   Saddam has prevented many foreigners from leaving both countries
and says he will use detained Westerners as ``human shields''
against attack from the multinational force massed in the gulf. He
has been freeing the hostages affew at a time.
   In other developments:
   -Oil industry sources said war in the gulf would cause
production engineers to flee, causing Saudi oil production to
plummet by as much as 2 million barrels a day. The sources, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, said the United States would make
up the shortfall from its strategic petroleum reserves.
   Analysts have said the price of crude oil, which has fluctuated
widely since Iraq seized Kuwait, could top $65 a barrel in the
event of war.
   -A small fire bomb exploded and another device was dismantled
Monday on Dutch rail lines used to transport U.S. military
equipment bound for the gulf, police said. Dutch opponents of the
military buildup in the gulf reportedly claimed responsibility.
   The explosion set fire to trackside electric installations
outside Boxtel, the Netherlands, causing delays in service, police
said. No one was injured, and there were no U.S. military trains in
the area at the time. Explosives experts later found a similar
device at Boxtel rail station, again disrupting rail service.

<HEAD>Ricks: America Is Headed For Brain Drain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American brain drain is in the making
because of a poor atmosphere for creative technology and an
aggressive engineer recruiting program by foreign companies, a NASA
advisory committee was told Monday.
   ``Our members are asking themselves what future is there for the
American aerospace worker,'' Leonard Ricks testified.
``Unfortunately, many of our colleagues are concluding that there
is no future and are leaving.''
   He spoke at the sixth and last hearing of the Advisory Committee
on the Future of the U.S. Space Program, which is preparing to
issue a final report on Dec. 17. The committee was set up in July
by NASA administrator Richard Truly.
  Ricks, executive director for the Council of Engineers and
Scientists Organizations, said American engineering journals now
contain ads ``by foreign countries who will steal American
technology by importing its creator.''
   He said public policy has focused on the management of the
nation's space program but not the creators of technology and said
focus on NASA's problems has created a witchhunt atmosphere.
   ``Today there is a feeding frenzy over many of the technical
difficulties that naturally occur in any complex scientific
endeavor,'' he said. ``Both the print and electronic media have
appeared jubilant over flaws in the Hubble (Space Telescope)
mirror, fuel leaks and other technical problems.''
   That, in turn, has produced an enormous morale problem in the
aerospace workforce, said Ricks, whose organization represents more
than 100,000 engineers.
   ``We are increasingly made to feel embarrassed by public policy
makers who see our programs as wasting money that could be spent in
meeting social needs. We are humiliated by the media's presentation
of our products as inferior and flawed.''
   America's space program, he said, is best characterized by the
word instability and cannot be otherwise without long-term
commitment.
   ``We need to think about the workforce of tomorrow,'' Ricks
said. ``Are we to condemn our young people to a future of
employment in fast food chains? If so, they do not need an
education to operate the foreign made computers that show the
pictures of burgers, fries and milkshakes, eliminating the need for
employees who read.''

   Negotiations to complete an
unprecedented global free trade pact opened in turmoil on Monday.
Delegates inside the hall clashed on farm issues, while police
outside battled angry demonstrators.
   Almost 30,000 farmers marched through the cobblestoned streets
of this European capital to protest a U.S.-backed proposal aimed at
trimming billions of dollars in trade-distorting agricultural
subsidies.
   At one point, police used tear gas and water cannon when
demonstrators tried to storm the European Parliament building.
   Organizers hoped the protest would send a blunt message to
delegates who have gathered for the concluding session of a
four-year effort to overhaul the world trading system.
   The talks are known as the Uruguay Round for the nation where
they began in 1986. They involve 107 member nations in an effort to
rewrite the constitution of world trade, a document known as the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT.
   The United States, hoping to reduce trade deficits still running
at close to $100 billion, is aggressively pushing a package of
proposals aimed at expanding export opportunities for American
farmers and businesses.
   In addition to trimming farm subsidies, the U.S. agenda included
efforts to crack down on the piracy of U.S. products, estimated to
cost American businesses $60 billion annually, and to expand GATT
rules to cover the fast-growing service industries, such as banking
and insurance.
   But officials of the 12-nation European Community, noting the
number of protesters, maintained that adoption of the U.S. farm
proposal would represent political suicide. They insisted that they
had no latitude to go beyond an offer for a 30 percent cut in
internal farm supports.
   ``The only flexibility I have is in explaining in detail the
impact which the reduction in internal supports will have,'' said
Ray MacSharry, the European Community's agriculture chief.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills told delegates in an
opening speech that the EC proposal was totally inadequate. The
United States is demanding 90 percent cuts in export subsidies,
used as incentives to promote overseas sales, and 75 percent
reductions in internal supports and market barriers.
   ``Only one thing stands between us and the triggering of a
worldwide economic renaissance - the stalemate over agriculture,''
she said.
   The United States believes that without a commitment to reduce
farm subsidies, Third World countries will walk away from the
negotiations, dooming any chances to get new trade rules to cover
service industries and copyright theft.
   Negotiators went into closed-door sessions late Monday on the
farm issue, but with time running short there was growing concern
that the talks could well end in failure.
   The only hopeful sign on Monday came in negotiations over
efforts to draft rules covering financial services, such as
banking. Canada, Japan, Sweden and Switzerland introduced a
proposal that U.S. negotiators said could represent a breakthrough
in this area.
   However, officials of Third World nations did not rush to
embrace the measure. Their support is considered crucial since
banks from America and other devoped countries see the Third World
as the primary area for expansion opportunities.
   Many delegates from Third World countries complained that their
needs were being ignored by the wealthy nations. They maintained
that no overall GATT agreement was possible without an end to the
costly farm subsidy battle, which steals potential markets from
their farmers.
   ``When I talk about agriculture, I am talking about human
decency itself,'' said Amaret Sila-on, minister of commerce for
Thailand. ``I am talking about 30 million human beings in my
country whose lives have been in abject poverty, generation after
generation, significantly as a result of agricultural practices and
polices of some countries in the developed world.''
   Pakistani Commerce Minister Malik Muhammad Naaem Khan said his
country was disappointed not only by the lack of movement in
agriculture but also by a failure to reach agreement to lower
barriers in textile trade, another item high on the agenda of Third
World nations.
   ``We have borne the burden of these restraints,'' he said. ``The
Uruguay Round is our hope.''
   But farmers, particularly the 10 million in the European
Community, viewed the trade talks as a threat to their livelihoods.
   ``We are all small farmers. We would have to leave the land,''
said Irish farmer Michael Murphy, one of those taking part in the
demonstrations.

<HEAD>Issues to be Resolved at GATT Talks</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Trade Talks, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a list of the most contentious issues to
be resolved at the trade talks in Brussels:
   - Agriculture: The linchpin of the talks. Declared aim:
``Substantial progressive reductions in agricultural support and
protection over a sustained period of time.'' The United States
wants cuts of 75 percent in internal supports and import barriers
and 90 percent in export subsidies over ten years. The 12-nation
European Community has offered a 30 percent cut in internal
supports by 1995. No negotiating text has been sent to Brussels.
   - Services: Aim is to set up a General Agreement on Trade in
Services, to liberalize trade in the $680 billion sector just as
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has opened markets in
goods. The United States wants a new agreement to allow the
continuation of bilateral accords. Most others say benefits granted
to one country must apply to all countries. The negotiating text is
littered with brackets, and an annex on financial services is left
blank.
   - Market Access: Aim is to reduce overall import tariffs by at
least one- third. Many countries have been slow in making offers,
leading to U.S. threats to withdraw some cuts it has proposed.
Washington offered cuts averaging 43 percent, leaving high tariffs
on textiles and other sensitive products. The EC proposed flat-rate
cuts, excluding agricultural products. The text is awaiting the
outcome of bilateral talks. Many negotiators say the issue is as
difficult as agriculture and services.
   - Anti-dumping: Aim is to revise the existing GATT anti-dumping
code, which authorizes duties against ``dumping'' goods on world
markets at artificially low prices. Japan and Southeast Asian
countries want tighter restrictions to prevent the West from using
such duties merely to protect inefficient industries. The West
wants new measures against the evasion of duties. There is no
agreed negotiating text.
   - Trade Related Investment Measures: Aim is to draw up rules on
measures that governments apply to investors such as the insistence
on use of local materials. The United States considers that all
such measures distort trade and should be controlled or banned. The
Third World says they are part of national development policies and
should not be regulated by GATT. There is no agreed negotiating
text.
   - Subsidies: Aim is to draw up rules governing both state aids
to industry and measures to counter exports subsidized in this
manner. Washington wants tough rules against subsidies. Countries
such as Canada and Southeast Asian nations say there should be more
restrictions on counterveiling duties - 90 percent of which are
imposed by the United States. The chairman of the group has drafted
a text but the it has not been officially accepted.
   - Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights: Aim is
to agree on new rules on copyright, trademarks, patents etc. There
are divisions among industrialized nations on patent standards.
Talks also are marked by a North-South split on whether
pharmaceutical products should be exempt from patent rules to
enable continued cheap access for the Third World. There is no
agreement on how any new rules should be enforced.
   - Textiles: Aim is to phase out the 16-year-old international
Multi-Fiber Arrangement - which restricts exports through bilateral
agreements - and bring it within GATT rules. There are differences
between Third World exporters, which want swift liberalization, and
industrialized countries with their own textile industries.
Outstanding issues include the scope of products to be covered, the
length of any phaseout, and whether or not to implement safeguard
measures against a sudden surge of imports during the transition.

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York and California legislators went
back to work Monday each facing $1 billion in politically unpopular
spending cuts.
   New York's Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo proposed the cuts to
avoid a projected $1 billion budget deficit for the fiscal year
ending March 31.
   California Gov. George Deukmejian, a Republican leaving office
in January, says his cuts would allow the nation's largest state to
finish its fiscal year June 30 with a balanced budget or just a
small deficit.
   Cuomo has recommended state worker layoffs, mandatory and unpaid
employee furloughs and cuts in state spending on education and
health care. But he proposed no new taxes and has said that this
deficit, unlike ones in the past, would not be wiped out by raiding
reserve funds and borrowing.
   It's the third consecutive year of budget deficits in New York
and next year appears no better. State Comptroller Edward Regan has
predicted a potential $3 billion deficit for the new fiscal year.
   Cuomo has said that cutting back spending was the only way to
solve New York's persistent fiscal problems.
   ``I frankly don't believe there are a whole lot of other
alternatives,'' Cuomo has said. ``There is no painless way out of
this recession.''
   Legislative leaders had been indicating they might be willing to
leave Cuomo's proposals largely intact. But as rank-and-file
legislators returned Monday, there were rumblings that negotiations
had stalled over the weekend.
   ``Let's put it this way - we're not at impasse,'' said Geoffrey
Taylor, spokesman for Democratic Assembly Speaker Mel Miller.
   Lawmakers, who recessed in midsummer, were meeting privately
Monday and a vote was not expected until Tuesday, at the earliest.
   In California, Deukmejian's plan would cut $600 million in
public school funding and $200 million from an income tax credit
for renters, as well as freeze state hiring and purchases in a $75
billion budget. Deukmejian says his budget cuts would give
California a cushion against worsening tax revenues.
   Deukmejian said he would like California legislators to approve
his plan before he leaves office in January. Many legislators,
particularly majority Democrats, would rather wait until Republican
Gov.-elect Pete Wilson takes office Jan. 7.
   New York and California have suffered sharp declines in tax
revenues and Cuomo has blamed his state's problems on a struggling
national economy.
   California had a $1.3 billion reserve that Deukmejian expects to
be depleted by the end of the budget year. New York has no such
reserve and the Cuomo administration has been trying to slow down
spending for months.

   Don Vig left his land to the North
Dakotan frost, and Tom Britbach's nephews are tending his cattle in
Montana. On Monday, the two joined about 30,000 fellow farmers from
around the world in protest.
   Small-farm owners say a U.S.-backed proposal under consideration
at trade talks here - aimed at trimming billions of dollars in
agricultural subsidies - could cost them their livelihood.
   The American farmers said they found that European and Asian
family farmers have the same fears they do. They worry that small
farms will disappear, leaving only big agriculture conglomerates
concerned with the bottom line.
   ``We will not sacrifice the lives and livelihoods of Japanese
farmers for the grain traders and other multinational
corporations,'' said Mitsugu Horiuchi, chairman of the Zenchu farm
lobby, which represents 5 million Japanese small-family farmers.
   ``Even if we are an ocean apart, we share the same values,''
said Vig, 39, who grows wheat and barley on his 1,400-acre farm in
Valley City, N.D. ``We are all fighting for a fair return on our
costs.''
   Vig says he cannot make enough of a profit to replace his aging
equipment.
   Britbach's farm in Circle, Mont., was tended by his father, and
his father before him. But he says he wonders if family farmers
have a chance.
   ``The big companies will eventually have absolute control,''
said Britbach, 62.
   About 400,000 American rural families gave up farming between
1985 and 1989 alone, said Randolph Nodland, president of the
National Family Farm Coalition.
   Proponents of industrial agriculture say that bigger farm
operations are more efficient and competitive in global markets.
   Farm issues, including subsidies, are the main point of
contention at the talks in Brussels.
   The United States and the 12-nation European Community are at
odds over the question. But Vig said he found common ground among
farmers when he visited farms in the Netherlands, France,
Czechoslovakia, Germany and Poland in the last two weeks.
   The European Community is preparing programs to help the small
family farmer survive subsidy cuts and other changes. The American
small farmer is still largely unprotected, the National Family Farm
Coalition says.
   ``Some family farmers think they are so key to the American
spirit that Americans would never let them disappear,'' said
coalition spokesman Brian Ahlberg. But Vig and Britbach say they're
not sure that's the case.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department reacted cautiously Monday
to the overthrow of the Chadian government by a rebel leader U.S.
officials say is supplied by Libya.
   ``The embassy is instructed to conduct normal contacts and
monitor the situation closely to determine whether a new regime has
effective control over the country,'' department spokeswoman
Margaret Tutwiler said.
   She said that U.S. Ambassador Richard Bogosian would met with
rebel leader Idriss Deby to find out what his policies are and
discuss future U.S.-Chadian relations.
   ``It appears that the forces of Mr. Deby are in effective
control'' of the Chadian capital of N'Djamena, she said.
   Asked if the United States would recognize the Deby government,
she responded: ``The issue of recognition is de-emphasized'' until
after a thorough diplomatic review.
   Tutwiler repeated the U.S. position that Deby, 38, a former
military aide to ousted President Hissene Habre was funded by
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
   ``I can tell you that the United States stands by the statement
of last week,'' she said. The department said then that Deby's
forces ``are armed and supplied by Libya.''
   Officials said then that Deby's attacks on Habre ``represent the
latest example of Libya's ongoing efforts to destabilize legitimate
governments.''
   Deby has promised to rule democratically. One of his first acts
in power was to free some 400 Libyan prisoners in Chad.
   Libya fought a series of wars with Habre's government before
being driven off Chadian territory in 1987.

<TEXT>
   One day after triumphing in all-German
elections, Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Monday began talks with
coalition allies on forming a new government and prepared to tackle
enormous problems facing the new Germany.
   His center-right coalition swept to victory in Sunday's
parliamentary balloting, the first in a united Germany since 1932,
but Kohl had little time to bask in the glory.
   On Monday, the chancellor began talks with his Christian
Democratic Union's current governing partners - their Bavarian
sister party, the Christian Social Union, and the centrist Free
Democrats.
   He was hit by an ultimatum from the Free Democrats, which made
more gains in the elections than any other party. They said they
would re-enter the coalition only if Kohl agreed that companies in
former East Germany should pay lower taxes than those in former
West Germany.
   ``No low-tax area, no vote for the chancellor,'' said Otto
Lambsdorff, chairman of the Free Democrats, arguing that would be
an important move toward encouraging badly needed investment in
eastern Germany.
   Kohl has said he opposes such a move, contending it is
unnecessary. On Monday, he refused to discuss the issue in public
and suggested his coalition partners do the same.
   ``I am of the old school that believes in talking first and
going public later,'' Kohl said.
   He also said he would ``not be put under time pressure by
anyone'' in forming a new Cabinet. He said he couldn't promise the
coalition negotiations would be concluded before Christmas.
   Kohl's day began with an announcement from Economics Minister
Helmut Haussmann, who said he was quitting the Cabinet amid what
German television claimed was growing criticism over his handling
of the economy.
   Haussmann was a major force in putting together the economic and
monetary union of West and East Germany in July, a crucial step
toward full unification on Oct. 3. He gave no reason for quitting.
   Later, the head of Germany's poerful central bank slammed
Kohl's plans to borrow $100 billion next year to finance
unification.
   In an interview with Stern magazine, Karl Otto Poehl said the
proposed sum was ``too high'' and demanded instead greater spending
cuts.
   Later, Kohl's Christian Democrats met to discuss coalition
negotiations and the vast problems the new government must tackle.
   At a press conference, Kohl counted off some of those issues. He
said ``important decisions'' needed to be made on ways to slash
government spending and raise further revenues to rebuild eastern
Germany.
   The chancellor has insisted he will not increase taxes to come
up with extra revenues for the massive reconstruction job, but he
has not disclosed just where the money will come from.
   Kohl could run up against opposition from his coalition partners
over such issues.
   The chancellor also said his government faces the huge task of
cleaning up former East Germany, which has severe pollution
problems.
   ``The legacy'' of East Germany's deposed Communist government
``is especially grave in this area,'' Kohl said.
   Germany will also have to take on new global responsibilities
that befit what is seen as its growing political and economic
stature on the world stage, Kohl said.
   But he indicated Germany will not likely be able to quickly make
the constitutional changes necessary to allow the deployment of
German troops in the Persian Gulf or elsewhere outside NATO areas.
   ``We will discuss this within the coalition and with the
(opposition) Social Democrats,'' he said.
   Many Social Democrats oppose constitutional changes.
   Kohl came under sharp international criticism in August when he
declined to send German troops to the gulf. But under Germany's
constitution, German troops cannot be deployed in non-NATO areas.
   Kohl has since said he favors the appropriate constitutional
amendment.
   The big losers in Sunday's elections were the Social Democrats -
the main opposition party - and the Greens. Both leftist parties
had criticized Kohl's swift pace of unification and accused his
Christian Democrats of underplaying the cost of bringing the east
up to the standard of the west.
   The Social Democrats gained 13 parliamentary seats, finishing
with 239.
   Western Germany's Greens, Europe's most-established ecology
movement, were voted out of Parliament. Their sister branch in
former East Germany snared only eight seats.
   Kohl's Christiahristian Social Union alliance
increased its strength from 305 to 313 seats in the 656-member
n Democrat and CParliament.
   However, they failed to attain the absolute majority that would
have allowed them to govern without the Free Democrats, which
increased their seats in Parliament from 57 to 79.

   Consumers continued to pay their bills in the
July-September quarter but were scaling back borrowing as the
economy headed into what many analysts say is a recession, a

Midwest and Canada to form the nation's third-largest salt company.
   Kerr-McGee Corp., meanwhile, said earlier it was completing its
withdrawal from the domestic offshore contract drilling business by
agreeing to sell its fleet to Noble Drilling Corp. of Houston for
$75 million. Included are 12 rigs, buildings and real estate.

   Kerin Trepke began working for the Greens
seven years ago, eager to assist a party that championed the
environment and the underprivileged. She didn't know her destiny
was the unemployment line.
   The Greens, which have brought together ecologists, women's
rights activists, peace activists and others under one banner, will
nearly vanish from the federal legislature as a result of Sunday's
elections.
   They will continue to exist as a political party and lobby
group, but with far less clout.
   On Monday, the party's headquarters was full of despair. Leaders
worried about the party's political future, and hundreds of staff
workers worried about their jobs.
   ``I guess all of us who work here will be seeing each other at
the unemployment office,''said Ms. Trepke. ``Unfortunately, having
worked for the Greens isn't exactly the best basis from which to
launch a job hunt.''
   The Greens' election losses turned years of politicking into
concern that the party's days might be numbered.
   They still hold seats in some state parliaments and city
councils, but far below the numbers held before the all-German
balloting.
   The Greens' pioneering West German branch, which astonished the
world by winning parliamentary seats seven years ago, was voted out
of office on Sunday.
   The party was rescued from parliamentary obliteration by a
coalition consisting of their East German branch and a group of
activists who helped topple East Germany's Communist government
last fall.
   Still, the Greens were reduced from 48 deputies in the federal
parliament to only eight.
   Their losses resulted from an often shrill opposition to
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's unification plans, and mainstream parties'
success in encroaching on Greens political turf with promises to
clean up the environment.
   ``Green arguments simply found no interest among the voters
because of the German euphoria kindled by Kohl,'' said party
spokeswoman Renate Dumas.
   In addition, deep ideological divisions within the party made
the Greens even more vulnerable.
   On Monday, party leaders surveyed the scene and decided they
should craft a new ``political concept'' at a congress early next
year, said spokesman Christian Stroebele.
   ``We have been given something very painful to think about,'' he
said.
   Ms. Trepke, a 46-year-old single mother of two and Greens
researcher on women's rights issues, said she feared years of work
would go down the drain because of the election results.
   ``This is a catastrophe, just horrible,'' she said. ``Policies
on minorities, on women's rights, everything that we've done here
could all fall flat.''
   A throng of party workers held an emergency meeting at Greens
headquarters to discuss their future.
   The current Greens lawmakers have a support staff of 266, and
most will probably soon be out of work, Ms. Trepke said. The
Greens' spacious offices will be replaced by smaller quarters for
the new lawmakers from eastern Germany, she said.
   ``It's all over for us,'' Ms. Trepke said. ``We assume the new
group will bring their own people.''
   Wolfram Grueber, a 39-year-old Greens specialist on the
homeless, said he had no idea what he would do if he lost his job.
   ``My work has been like a never-ending road race, and I had
little time to consider what I would do instead,'' he said.
   He said he wasn't optimistic about finding a job with another
political group.
   ``We've made ourselves unloved to the established parties. But
that's all right. That was our function.''

   The son of Interior Secretary Manuel
Lujan was formally charged Monday with raping a woman who lived in
the same apartment building as he and his parents, authorities
said.
   Robert Jeffrey Lujan, 28, was indicted on one count each of
burglary, rape, sodomy and use of a firearm during the commission
of a crime, according to Commonwealth's Attorney John Kloch.
   If convicted, Lujan, who lived with his parents, could face a
maximum of three life prison terms, plus two years, in prison.
   Lujan has been held without bail in the city jail, after a judge
said he posed ``an unreasonable danger'' to the community.
   During a court hearing, an Alexandria woman testified that the
younger Lujan broke into her apartment, spoke with her for two
hours, then led her up five flights of stairs and back to her
apartment before forcing her to have sex with him early on the
morning of Nov. 11.
   Lujan's attorney, Robert Powell, said during the hearing that
his client spent several hours in the woman's apartment, but
maintained he was invited and that sexual relations were by mutual
consent.
   Robert Lujan was arrested four days after the alleged incident.
   The Interior Secretary said after the arrest that his son had a
severe drinking problem.

   Holiday giftgivers should avoid buying toys,
cosmetics and ornaments that come wrapped in excessive plastic and
cardboard, an environmental coalition said Monday.
   The third set of ``Wastemaker'' awards handed out by Rep. Frank
Pallone Jr., D-N.J., and the Wastewatch coalition of environmental
groups was meant to encourage shoppers to think environmentally.
   ``As with all Wastemaker products, it is the consumer and the
taxpayer who pay the price,'' Pallone said. He said special
packaging costs more at purchase time and increases taxes for solid
waste disposal.
   U.S. Public Interest Research Group and Clean Water Action
joined Pallone and Environmental Action at a news conference to
cite nine products that should be avoided.
   The products, purchased in the last three weeks at Washington
area stores, include:
   - Tiny model cars called ``Matchbox Super Color Changers'' made
by a New Jersey toymaker. According to Wastewatch, they are
packaged in form-fitting plastic, glued to a cardboard display card
accompanied by a small sponge and disposable plastic tub for color
changes.
   ``The product that's been cited is not in the line and hasn't
been for the last year,'' said Michele Litzky, spokeswoman for
Matchbox Toys USA Ltd., of Moonachie, N.J.
   - A trophy figure and a scorecard for the popular Nintendo video
game. The accessory was cited for an oversized cardboard package
and plastic window.
   ``It's a little surprising they selected a product that hasn't
been sold since 1988,'' said Wayne Charness, vice president of
Hasbro, Inc., in Pawtucket, R.I. He said 90 percent of Hasbro's
packaging is recycled fiber and the company has been increasing its
use of recycled materials.
   - Sears, Roebuck and Co.'s four trumpet-shaped Christmas
ornaments enclosed in a heavy plastic tray, cardboard box and clear
plastic lid. Wastewatch said Sears offered a round tree ornament
packaged in environmentally preferable recyclable cardboard.
   ``Our first concern is that the product is packaged so that when
the customer opens it at home, the product is not broken, dented,
bent or scratched,'' said Gordon Jones, a spokesman for the Chicago
retailer.
   However, he said the company was working with suppliers to
develop environmentally sound packages and had eliminated plastic
foam from many of its holiday light sets.
   - A Drakkar Noir cosmetics gift set, a product of Cosmair Inc.
Two small bottles are encased in a heavy cardboard box with plastic
inserts. Cecilia Noguera, a spokeswoman for Cosmair's fragrance
division in New York City, declined to comment.
   Other products cited were Saranac football gloves made by the
Saranac Glove Co. in Green Bay, Wis.; Smooshees Smugglers hair
accessories from Fisher Price in East Aurora, N.Y.; Holiday
Enchantment cassette tape set from Moose Records, Tapes and CDs in
San Francisco; Calvin Klein ``Obsession'' gift set from Calvin
Klein Cosmetics Corp. in New York City; and Carlton Cards wrap and
trim ensemble from American Greetings Corp. of Cleveland.

<TEXT>
   The music world Monday mourned the death of
composer Aaron Copland, the son of immigrants whose genius earned
him the title ``Dean of American Music.''
   Copland died Sunday at Phelps Memorial Hospital in North
Tarrytown of respiratory failure brought on by pneumonia. He was
90. He had recently suffered two strokes.
   ``He created the American sound in symphonic music,'' said
composer William Schuman.
   ``Copland believed in the validity of American music, that we
were not inferior to our European cousins,'' Schuman said. ``He
wrote music only an American could have written.''
   Copland was being cremated and the funeral service was private,
said his attorney, Ellis Freedman. A public musical tribute is
planned, he said.
   Copland was known for his plain-spoken compositions such as
``Appalachian Spring,'' ``Rodeo,'' and ``Billy the Kid.'' The
Brooklyn-born son of Jewish immigrants from East Europe was
remembered in death as the prototypical American composer.
   ``He had a uniquely American voice and was able to express in
his music particularly American sensibilities using substantially
the language of European serious music,'' said Kenneth Haas,
managing director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra.
   Copland's composing career gave the world such popular pieces as
``Fanfare for the Common Man,'' an orchestral composition the late
Leonard Bernstein once called ``the all-time top of the hit parade
in American music.''
   Copland won the 1944 Pulitzer Prize for Composition for
``Appalachian Spring,'' which was commissioned by choreographer
Martha Graham; an Oscar for his musical score of ``The Heiress'' in
1948; and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1964.
   Graham, on retreat in Hawaii after completing a six-week Far
East tour, called Copland ``a very dear friend and a very great
artist.''
   ``Aaron and I and `Appalachian Spring' have had such a long
journey together,'' she said in a statement released by her
Manhattan-based dance company. ``It is very difficult for me to
accept that he is gone.''
   Another dance great, Agnes DeMille, also mourned Copland's
death. But, outspoken as always, DeMille said she did not think of
Copland as a ``world-class'' composer.
   ``He was a very great composer; the finest we had. He's not by
any means in a world class. ... But I liked him awfully,'' she
said. ``He was wonderful to work with, charming to be with, an
expert worker.''
   DeMille recalled when Copland told her he had started conducting
and mentioned how much he enjoyed it. ``By the way, he was a bad
conductor,'' she interjected, and continued:
   ``He then said, `Agnes, have you ever conducted?' and I said,
`Of all the damn fool questions you ever asked me, Aaron, that one
takes the cake.'''
   The anecdote shows the simple side of Copland, a man who many
described as a down-to-earth, uncomplicated genius.
   ``Usually geniuses are self-centered, and I thought, `How can a
man be a genius and still be so nice?''' recalled Pulitzer
Prize-winning composer David Del Tredici, who claims Copland as his
mentor.
   Copland quit composing in the early 1970s and swore he didn't
miss it.
   ``You'd think if you had spent 50 years at it you'd have the
feeling that something was missing, and I really don't,'' he told
an interviewer.
   ``I must have expressed myself sufficiently. I certainly don't
feel tortured or bitter, only lucky to have been given so long to
be creative. And resigned to the fact that it appears to be over.''
   At his birthday celebration two weeks ago, Copland ate apple
pie, which he preferred to cake. Surrounded by longtime friends, he
read messages from young fans.
   ``He was not the least pretentious,'' said Schuman. ``If you
didn't know he was one of the greatest artists of the century, you
would never suspect it.''
   Copland taught at the Boston Symphony's Tanglewood music school
in Lenox, Mass., for 25 years and was head of the faculty there
when he stepped down in 1970. His students included Bernstein and
composer Lukas Foss.
   ``He lived a very productive 90 years,'' Haas said. ``Happily,
we will have his music to appreciate even though we don't have him
any more.''
   Copland, a lifelong bachelor, is survived by a niece, Felice
Marlin of Manhattan; and two nephews, Ralph Marcus of Stuart, Fla.,
and Burton Marcus of Woodmere.

<TEXT>
   After 15 years of civil war,
Marxist-inspired one-party rule, foreign invasion and economic
crisis, Angola's leaders begin a new strugle on Tuesday - to
radically change the nature of their country.
   President Jose Eduardo dos Santos's party is to debate plans at
a congress being held to introduce multiparty democracy and a free
market economy and to discuss peace terms with the U.S.-backed
UNITA guerrilla movement.
   In preparing to emulate his allies in the Soviet Union, dos
Santos faces a challenge from hard-liners within his Popular
Movement for the Liberation of Angola, or MPLA. They have yet to
follow him in dropping Marxist rhetoric and embracing his ``new
option'' of democratic socialism.
   In 11 years as party leader and president of the war-torn
southern African nation, dos Santos has survived the jockeying for
power within the MPLA.
   He has given strong signals in recent months, however, that he
plans to abandon the communist model and open the political system
to opposition forces, including UNITA - the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola.
   Jonas Savimbi's UNITA rebels have been fighting the MPLA since
Angola gaindd independence from Portugal in 1975.
   The two sides opened peace talks in Portugal last April to end
their war, which has devastated what is potentially one of the
richest countries in Africa.
   At the fifth round of talks last month, Portuguese officials
mediating the negotiations said a cease-fire was in sight.
   A truce must be followed by political changes allowing UNITA a
stake in Angola's future.
   This week's congress is to discuss major constitutional reforms
aimed at removing the ruling party's position as the guiding force
in society, legalizing opposition groups and preparing for general
elections.
   Dos Santos says a multiparty system can be implemented early
next year.
   To ensure support for the changes, he is expected to remove at
least five longtime members from the 13-member Politburo and
officially shed the party's Marxist ideology.
   Sub-Saharan Africa's second-largaest nation, Angola is rich in
oil, diamonds and other minerals. It has an abundance of arable
land and well-stocked Atlantic fishing grounds. Its deep-water
ports at Luanda and Lobito could be a key economic outlet for other
southern African nations.
   But fighting has crippled economic activity and cut
communications. Only exports from the heavily guarded northwestern
oil fields have kept the economy afloat.
   Also, an estimated 2 million of Angola's 10 million people face
famine after a four-year drought.
   Dos Santos concedes that war was not the only cause of Angola's
economic woes. He admitted in a recent address before 700
businessmen in Luanda that the centralized system adopted by all of
Portugal's African colonies after independence resulted in many
errors.
   The most important, dos Santos said, was not understanding the
role of private enterprise in Angola's economic recovery.
   He promised reforms that would aid small-business owners and
encourage foreign investment. A long-awaited devaluation of the
kwanza was introduced in September as part of an austerity program.
   The government and UNITA remain divided on such issues as the
timing of elections, integration of the two armed forces and the
composition of an international force to verify a cease-fire.
   While both sides have expressed cautious optimism after last
month's talks, fighting has flared since. UNITA commandos conducted
daring raids on economic targets in the Luanda area last week,
blowing up bridges, water pipes and electricity lines. They damaged
the Luanda oil refinery, leaving the capital facing energy and gas
shortages.
   A Cuban officer and two soldiers were killed in the attacks.
   Cuba maintains about 10,000 soldiers here from the estimated
50,000 stationed in Angola since the late-1970s. In a 1988
agreement with South Africa, which had made incursions into Angola,
Cuba said it would withdraw its force and South Africa pledged to
halt its aid to UNITA.
   The United States has said it will not stop helping UNITA until
the government guarantees the rebels a role in a mulitparty
society.

   The U.S. Department of Energy said Monday
it is investigating an engineer's complaint she was harassed after
warning that emptying two tanks at the Hanford nuclear reservation
could cause an explosion.
   Her warning was later vindicated by a General Accounting Office
report that said too little was known about the explosive potential
of the tanks.
   Engineer Inez Austin contends employer Westinghouse Hanford Co.
is destroying her career because of her alert.
   Ken Morgan of the Department of Energy's Richland office said
Monday that the agency takes harassment of whistle-blowers
seriously. ``We do not have much first-hand information about'' Ms.
Austin's case, he said.
   A Hanford watchdog group said the incident was the latest in a
pattern of harassment against whistle-blowers on the reservation in
south-central Washington. Hanford for decades produced plutonium
for nuclear weapons, but now is largely focusing on cleaning up
years of contamination at the federal site.
   ``The harassment of whistle-blowers who are trying to protect
the public from extremely dangerous waste tanks is rampant,'' said
Gerald Pollet of Heart of America Northwest.
   Six weeks ago, Energy Secretary James Watkins toured Hanford and
promised whistle-blowers would be protected and rewarded. Last
month, Westinghouse Hanford issued guidelines for protecting
whistle-blowers.
   Ms. Austin, who made her concerns public Saturday, said, ``We've
always been told if there is a problem go to your manager and if
there is a safety concern they will listen. It is a blow to find
out it is not true.''
   Last June, Ms. Austin contends, she demanded a delay in the
pumping of radioactive liquids from two waste storage tanks that
the company did not want to grant. The pumping was canceled anyway
after the GAO report.
   The tanks contained ferrocyanide, which could explode if
internal tank temperatures top 400 degrees Fahrenheit. The chemical
was added in the 1950s to concentrate the tank liquids.
   Ms. Austin, who had served on a panel that analyzed the safety
of pumping 22 tanks containing ferrocyanide, had been asked to
approve the emptying of two tanks. She refused, saying that
removing liquids could cause the internal temperatures to rise,
possibly to dangerous levels, said Tom Carpenter, an attorney for
the private Government Accountability Project.
   The next day she argued with her supervisor and another engineer
over the refusal, Carpenter said.
   Westinghouse spokesman John Burk said the technology did not
allow enough of the liquid to be removed from the sludge at the
bottom of the tank to raise internal temperatures. He also said 15
of the frrocyanide tanks had been pumped in the past without
incident.
   Ms. Austin, a Westinghouse employee since 1979, contends she has
since suffered a reduction of duties, a poor job evaluation,
failure to receive mail, and even constant temperature fluctuations
in her office. She said the actions were designed to make her quit,
which she has not done.
   She said she has filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of
Labor.
   After the argument Ms. Austin took the rest of the day and the
next day as vacation days, Carpenter said. Burk said Westinghouse
employees are not allowed to take vacation days on such short
notice.
   ``Her manager gave her a letter of reprimand,'' said Burk,
adding that the company has since rescinded the letter. He said
Westinghouse Hanford President Roger Nichols is personally
investigating some of her allegations.

   Changes in interest rates on short-term
Treasury securities were mixed in Monday's auction.
   The Treasury Department sold $10.0 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 7.06 percent, up from 7.02 percent
last week. Another $10.0 billion was sold in six-month bills at an
average discount rate of 6.96 percent, unchanged from last week.
   The three-month bill rate was the highest since 7.08 percent on
Nov. 19. The six-month bill rate was the lowest since it averaged
6.71 percent on July 5, 1988.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
- 7.29 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,821.50 and 7.31 percent for six-month bills with a $10,000
bill selling for $9,648.10.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, rose to 7.30
percent last week, up from 7.29 percent the previous week.

   A whistle-blower who contended that Army
helicopters in the Persian Gulf were operating without proper
protection against heat-seeking missiles began a new job Monday.
   Calvin J. Weber, 48, of Arnold, has criticized the defensive
capabilities of some Huey and Blackhawk helicopters being used in
the Desert Shield operation against Iraq.
   Weber, a civilian Army employee, was removed in handcuffs Oct.
25 from the Army Aviation Systems Command after he refused to
leave. He was placed on administrative leave with pay while
authorities investigated the incident.
   In his new job, Weber will inspect construction projects and
check utility costs. He was ordered to report for work at the
Melvin Price Support Center in Granite City, Ill., until his
present extension from being fired expires Jan. 11.
   An Army memo at the time of Weber's removal from the AVSCOM
building said he had been asking about ``sensitive information and
intimating'' that he would disclose it publicly. Disclosure ``could
be highly detrimental to the security of the United States,'' the
memo said.
   Since then, the inspector general of the Pentagon has decided t
investigate efforts to fire Weber, in response to a request from
Sen. William V. Roth, R-Del.
   In addition, Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., has asked Army
Secretary Michael Stone to look into the action against Weber.
Conyers heads an oversight subcommittee of the House Government
Operations Committee.
   ``It appears there may have been an attempt to silence and
discredit an Army employee,'' Conyers wrote. ``One senior Army
official has stated that the Army doesn't disagree with what he
(Weber) is saying, just in who he is saying it to.''
   AVSCOM spokesman Robert E. Hunt said he could not speculate what
will happen to Weber after Jan. 11, because he has been given
several extensions since he got his termination notice.

   Two jets taxiing for takeoff at the
Detroit airport collided in fog today and one of them, a DC-9 with
43 aboard, burned to a blackened hulk. At least 19 people were
killed, officials said.
   The two Northwest Airlines planes were the DC-9, bound for
Pittsburgh with 39 passengers and four crew members, and a Boeing
727-200 headed for Memphis with 146 passengers and 10 crew member
aboard, the airline said.
   Alan Muncaster, Northwest's vice president of communication in
Egan, Minn., confirmed the 19 fatalities.
   An undetermined number of persons were injured, some with severe
burns, authorities said. All the severe injuries and deaths were
believed to be among people on the Pittsburgh-bound plane,
authorities said.
   ``As soon as I heard the thump we came to an abrupt stop,'' said
Robert Karp, a passenger on the 727. ``I remember looking at the
other plane and seeing smoke rolling out.''
   Muncaster said that apparently the the right wing of the 727 hit
the aft section, the engine, of the DC9, taking the engine off,
Muncaster said. ``That resulted in the fire,'' he said. ``That at
this point is all we know.''
   He said that at the time of the 1:45 p.m. crash, the airport had
been closed to inbound traffic because of fog but they were
allowing planes to take off. A winter storm had moved through the
area earlier in the day.
   Passengers from the 727 walked off the plane, down the stairs,
said Karp, 60, a college professor from Jackson, Miss.
   When the impact occurred, he said, ``I thought the tire had
blown out. The front end of the plane had begun to lift off. I
don't think the back wheels were off the ground yet.'' Passengers
were shook up but unhurt, he said.
   The wing appeared to be torn from the plane, 727 passenger
Edward Duda said.
   Tony Dresden, a spokesman for the National Air Traffic
Controllers Association, said according to preliminary reports from
the scene, ``The DC-9 pilot became lost on the runways.''
   ``The pilot gave the ground controller erroneous information
about his position and turned right onto the runway where the 727
was taxiing,'' he said.
   ``The DC-9 pilot discovered at the very last moment where he
was, and so the ground controller told him to immediately get off
that runway, but it was too late,'' Dresden said, stressing that
the description of the accident was preliminary.
   Edward McNamara, Wayne County executive, said there were at
least some survivors on the DC-9 and that the only injuries on the
Boeing were those that occurred during the evacuation of the plane.
   Linda Kalinsky, Taylor Ambulance Co., said, ``We were told that
there were 50 or 60 injuries'' including some burn victims.
   Originally, the Federal Aviation Administration said the planes'
wingtips struck. Later, Northwest said the wing of the 727hit the
rear section of the DC9.
   After the accident, one of the planes could be seen surrounded
by emergency vehicles, smoke pouring from what appeared to be a
burned fuselage, tail blackened by fire. The fuselage appeared to
be hollowed out as if by flames.
   By an hour after the accident, the fire was apparently out,
McNamara said.
   As dusk settled in around 4 p.m., a stand of huge lights were
wheeled into place near the cockpit of the DC-9 on Runway 3C to
allow firefighters and investigators to see.
   At the time of the crash, weather was foggy, and the ground was
wet from a morning snow and sleet storm that delayed flights at the
airport.
   At least 11 people were brought or en route to Annapolis
Hospital in Wayne, said spokeswoman Pat O'Dowd, and at least one
was in critical condition. Two of the victims at that hospital were
transferred to the University of Michigan Medical Center Burn
Center at Ann Arbor.
   Romulus, where Detroit Metropolitan Airport is located, is some
10 miles west of Detroit.
   It was the site of the second worst air crash in U.S. history,
the Aug. 16, 1987, crash of a Northwest MD-80, on takeoff in which
156 people were killed.
   The airport was closed briefly after the accident and later
reopened.
   Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board were
being dispatched to the scene to begin a probe aimed at determining
the cause of the accident, a safety board spokesman said.

   The Education Department will ask Congress to
toughen the Higher Education Act to cut down on defaults in the
federal student loan program, an official said Monday.
   Leonard L. Haynes III, assistant secretary for post-secondary
education, told a banking convention that student loan defaults are
costing the nation nearly $2 billion a year. He said the figure is
``simply unacceptable'' although it may pale against other federal
agency debts.
   To reduce the default rates, Haynes said, the department will
seek to toughen major provisions in the Higher Education Act when
it comes up for reauthorization next year. The law is the statutory
authority for about 60 higher education programs.
   Haynes said the department may require stringent performance
standards of both students, colleges, universities and trade
schools before they are allowed to join student loan programs.
There also may be greater scrutiny of administrative and financial
abilities of schools, as well as the quality of education offered,
he said.
   ``We will not reinvent the wheel, but we believe we must create
a more efficient, fairer, and less confusing student aid delivery
system, while continuing to maximize postsecondary access and
choice for needy students,'' he said.
   Haynes, speaking at a Consumer Bankers Association conference,
stressed that ``we are committed to taking the lead on reforming
student financial aid and other higher education programs.''
   ``What we have in place is not serving us well,'' said Haynes.
``But the question is how good is better.''
   The total of student loan defaults is $7.8 billion. An estimated
$12 billion will be loaned to some 5 million students during fiscal
1990.
   This year the Education Department has come under harsh
criticisms by members of Congress for lax oversight of the federal
student loan program.
   A report by investigators for the Senate Government Affairs
subcommittee on investigations faulted the department for ``very
minimal, if any, oversight over the accrediting bodies.''
   The department, the report added, granted schools eligibility in
the student loan program without verifying that they were licensed
and accredited.
   ``The department will place a greater emphasis on performance
standards and outcomes measures in the areas of school
accreditation, eligibility, licensing, and student success,''
Haynes said.
   Haynes said performance standards might focus on an
institution's ability to keep and graduate students once enrolled,
as well as dropout and pass-fail ratios, and placement rates.
   Although the department cannot assess curriculum, Haynes said,
it may ``use the outcomes of the educational program to determine
its quality.''
   In addition, Haynes said ``we hope to eliminate unscrupulous
recruiting techniques and weak admissions standards that often have
misled students into poor quality schools and defaults on loans.''

   A blizzard swept through Wisconsin and more than a foot of snow
fell in Iowa as much of the upper Midwest struggled through early
snowstorms that closed schools, toppled power lines and snarled
travel.
   A plastic bubble covering the indoor practice field of the Rose
Bowl-bound Iowa Hawkeyes collapsed under heavy snow in Iowa City.
In Nebraska, an 81-year-old man died of a heart attack after
shoveling snow.
   Weather was overcast in suburban Detroit where two jets taxiing
for takeoff collided, killing 19 people. The ground was wet from a
morning snow and sleet storm that delayed flights at the airport,
but the cause of the collision has not been determined.
   The storm continued moving eastward later Monday, with up to 6
inches of snow falling in western New York. Winter storm warnings
were posted for Tuesday in northern Maine.
   ``We held off as long as we could. You've got to get people in
the mood for Christmas, so you need a little white stuff around,''
said Gerald E. English, chief meteorologist for the weather service
at the Greater Rochester International Airport in New York.
   In hard-hit Iowa, scores of schools and businesses closed their
doors or delayed opening Monday as high winds and heavy snows
brought much of the state to a standstill. Airports closed for part
of the day in Dubuque, Ottumwa and Sioux City.
   No injuries were reported when a plastic bubble covering the
University of Iowa's football workout field ripped open and
collapsed. But athletic officials said repairs would not be
completed in time for practice for the Jan. 1 Rose Bowl.
   Up to 14 inches of snow fell in central and southeast Iowa.
Winds gusting up to 56 mph whipped the snow, leaving cars and
trucks stranded along roadways.
   ``Usually it's a bad sign to have this much snow at this
point,'' said climatologist Harry Hillaker of the National Weather
Service in Des Moines. ``I wouldn't be surprised if this winter is
snowier than normal.''
   On Sunday afternoon, a teen-ager was killed near Numa in
southeastern Iowa when the car he was riding in slid off an icy
road and into a ditch.
   The storm knocked out power to 45,000 customers in the Chicago
area, as freezing rain and high winds snapped power lines.
   ``The outages are scattered all over. There's not too many
places that are immune,'' Commonwealth Edison spokesman John Hogan
said. By midmorning, about half the customers had power restored,
he said.
   In Wisconsin, blizzards dumped more than a foot of snow in
southern areas of the state. The storm trapped planes at 19
airports and resulted in hundreds of minor accidents, authorities
said.
   ``This is a storm we haven't seen the likes of in quite some
time, '' said Steve Davis, a meteorologist at the National Weather
Service office in Sullivan.
   The storm was accompanied by strong winds, gusting up to 54 mph
at Milwaukee, causing blowing and drifting snow. The Milwaukee and
Madison school sytems were among those canceling classes.
   Up to 7 inches of snow fell in Nebraska, where many students in
the southeastern part of the state received a day off.
   But freezing temperatures and light snow didn't stop more than
700 people from attending Minden's ``Light of the World'' Christmas
pageant Sunday night. The pageant has never been canceled since it
began in 1946.
   ``It simply amazes me,'' director Ben Morey said. ``There is
always somebody that shows up.''
   Schools also were closed in Michigan, where the storm dumped up
to 3 inches of snow by the morning rush hour. More snow was
expected in the northern half of the state.
   State police said at least 45 schools and school districts in
southern Michigan called off classes Monday.
   Elsewhere, the storm dumped up to a foot of snow in southern
Minnesota and forced some schools to close or open late.
   As the storm moved eastward, western New York reported its first
major snowstorm of the season. Up to 6 inches of snow fell south of
Rochester, and more than a hundred fender-benders were reported
throughout the region.
   ``The first day like this, everybody has to learn to drive all
over again,'' said Jerry Hooven, an American Automobile Association
spokesman in Buffalo.

   The United States cannot be sure economic
sanctions will ever force Iraq out of Kuwait, and waiting for such
an uncertain outcome would risk erosion of the international
coalition behind military force, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said
Monday.
   Cheney, laying out to the Senate Armed Services Committee the
administration's rationale for building up a military force for
possible attack in the Persian Gulf, gave the most pessimistic view
yet on the potential of sanctions to work.
   ``Given the nature of the regime, given Saddam Hussein's
brutality to his own people, his very tight control of that
society, his ability to allocate resources for the military, their
ability to produce their own food ... he can ride them out,''
Cheney told the committee.
   Several of the panel's Democrats, including chairman Sam Nunn of
Georgia, contended the administration seemed to be dismissing
sanctions too easily. ``If we go to war, we never will know whether
they would have worked,'' Nunn said.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, voiced misgivings about a ``Chicken
Little approach to our policy. The sky is falling and the only
option is war.''
   Cheney spelled out in detail the U.S. position that American and
international interests are in jeopardy in the gulf risis,
contending that Saddam might gain a stranglehold on oil, that he is
destroying Kuwait and that his continued military buildup that
could mean further aggression.
   ``It is not so clear that time is altogether on our side,''
Cheney said, a stamen that appeared in conflict with earlier
administration pronouncements. As recently as Oct. 15, Cheney
himself had said the opposite.
   He said Monday that lengthy reliance on sanctions would cede to
Saddam the ability to determine future events. ``Such a policy
would give Hussein a long breathing space'' during which he could
augment his army, Cheney contended.
   ``It is far better for us to deal with him now ... than it will
be for us to deal with him five or 10 years from now, when the
members of the coalition have gone their disparate ways and when
Saddam has become an even better armed and more threatening
regional superpower than he is at present,'' Cheney said.
   As for authority to attack Saddam, Cheney said in response to a
question from Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, ``I do not believe the
president requires any additional authority from the Congress
before committing U.S. forces to achieve our objectives in the
gulf.''
   Many Democratic lawmakers have strongly urged the Bush
administration to give the sanctions more time to work before
mounting an attack aimed at pushing Iraq out of Kuwait, and have
said Congress must have a clear role in any decision to attack.
   House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., drew a standing ovation
when he told a meeting of House Democrats on Monday that ``before
any decision is made by the president'' to take military action,
``he should come to the 102nd Congress.'' That Congress begins
early next month.
   At the Pentagon, meanwhile, officials said Cheney had signed an
order raising from 125,000 to 188,000 the number of National Guard
and Reserve members who can be ordered to active duty, suggesting a
new round of activations.
   There are 96,834 members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine
Corps and Coast Guard reserves on active duty.
   In major developments last week, the U.N. Security Council
authorized force against Iraq if Kuwait is not freed by Jan. 15,
and President Bush said he would send Secretary of State James A.
Baker III to Iraq for an eye-to-eye, last-chance meeting with
Saddam before that date.
   Baker, asked Monday why he is going, said that if the use of
force is to be a credible option for the U.S. government, ``we need
to make certain the American people understand we are leaving no
stone unturned in the search for a peaceful solution.''
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Iraq had not
formally responded to Bush's proposal for Baker to fly to Baghdad
and for Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz to visit the United
States for talks, though diplomats from both sides are discussing
preliminary scheduling.
   Ms. Tutwiler said negotiating teams have agreed that any talks
be limited to the United States and Iraq.
   Scheduling has been discussed at two meetings so far in Baghdad.
During both meetings, she said, Joseph Wilson, the charge
d'affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, raised concerns about
the American hostages in Iraq, but ``heard nothing new from the
Iraqi government.''
   She said about 88 Americans remain hostage in Iraq, their
numbers thinned by the release last weekend of 15 detainees.
   Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Colin Powell, appearing with
Cheney, said the U.S. gulf force ``clearly has an offensive
capability'' to force Iraq's occupying force out of Kuwait.
   For Iraq, ``the question they will have to consider is do they
move it, or do they lose it,'' Powell said, adding: ``If it is
necessary to go to war, we go to war to win.''
   Powell said while the large and growing U.S. force is difficult
to supply, logistics is a manageable problem for the moment. The
United States now has more than 240,000 troops in the region, and
Bush has ordered an additional 200,000 who should be in place by
January.
   ``We have the possibility of keeping the force at that level for
some period of time,'' he said. ``There will come a point where it
will become very difficult to keep that force in place for an
extended period.'' When pressed for a time period, he said one year
is possible.

<TEXT>
   House Democratic leaders are proposing new
rules to let lawmakers accept unlimited donations to cover any
legal costs they may incur in the upcoming redistricting.
   Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas, sponsor of the proposed rules change
unveiled Monday, said the redistricting process will generate many
costly lawsuits, and lawmakers need to protect themselves.
   But Fred Wertheimer, president of Common Cause, said the House
Democratic plan, if approved, would accomplish exactly the opposite
of what the public wants.
   The party caucus is to consider the proposed rules change
Tuesday.
   `It's as if no one there is paying any attention to the Keating
five hearings going on across the street in the other chamber,''
said Wertheimer, referring to the Senate ethics hearings on
influence peddling in the savings-and-loan scandal.
   Congressional districts across the nation will be changed as a
result of the new census. The outcome could critically affect many
1992 House races.
   ``The likelihood is high that a number of members would want
legal advice,'' said Frost, who heads a Democratic group reviewing
House rules and making suggestions for changes.
   Many lawmakers were considering how to deal with the cost, Frost
said, but the law regarding the special legal funds was gray and
``at your own risk.''
   Frost said his proposal was more strict than some approaches,
since public reporting of the donations would be required.
   Asked if the plan raised ethical questions, he said, ``As long
as you have public disclosure, the answer is no.''
   Under the Frost plan, lawmakers would establish redistricting
accounts, and would have to report contributions to and spending
from them. That reporting would be done as part of Congress' annual
financial disclosure process, which allows a lag of up to 1{ years
between the transaction and the public reporting of it.
   Normally, House rules limit gifts to members at $200. Under the
Frost plan, that limit would be waived for any donations for legal
costs associated with redistricting. In addition, federal election
law limits on campaign donations would not apply.
   Wertheimer, whose group lobbies Congress to upgrade its ethics
standards, said he was sending a telegram to all House Democrats
urging them to turn down the plan in their caucus Tuesday.
   ``It would create an outrageous loophole for opening the door
for outside special interests to provide unlimited contributions to
help a member of Congress in a critical electoral matter,'' he
said.
   ``This is a time when the House should be taking steps to
eliminate the ability of outside interest groups to provide money
to elected officials who decide their interests,'' he said.

<HEAD>Hard-liners Hail Shake-Up in Interior Ministry, Call for Crackdown</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hard-line legislators on Monday praised President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev for responding to their criticism and
replacing the interior minister with a KGB general expected to
crack down on dissent, Tass reported.
   Col. Victor Alksnis, who has threatened to seek Gorbachev's
resignation if he does not take action by Dec. 17 to prevent the
break-up of the Soviet Union, termed the replacement of Interior
Minister Vadim Bakatin a step in the right direction.
   Gorbachev's removal of Bakatin ``is obviously a response to the
ultimatum by Alksnis,'' who heads the `Soyuz' group of right-wing
legislators, said Dmitri Simes, a Soviet expert at the Carnegie
Endowment for Peace in Washington. But Simes said it was difficult
to know if Gorbachev was sympathic to their demands or surrendering
to them.
   Alksnis denied that a crack-down would lead to more violence,
but only because he believes bloodshed is now inevitable.
   ``Mountains of weapons have been stockpiled in the republics,
threatening us with uncountable disasters,'' he warned.
   Soyuz is expecting Gorbachev to relieve other officials it finds
unacceptable as well, said another member, legislator Yevgeny
Kogan.
   Gorbachev also plans to transfer several divisions from the
regular army to the Interior Ministry troops, which handle
outbreaks of ethnic and political violence inside Soviet borders,
said independent lawmaker Vladmir Kirillov, according to Tass.
   Bakatin is popular among some liberals for keeping tighter rein
on his riot police since 19 peaceful demonstrators were killed by
troops wielding shovels and gas in Tbilisi last year.
   He was replaced by Boris Pugo, a Communist Party official who
became a KGB major general while running the secret police in
Latvia in the early 1980s.
   Pugo is a friend of Alksnis, Simes said. Both men are Latvians
who are extremely unpopular in their native land for their
opposition to independence from the Soviet Union, Simes said.
   Pugo's deputy will be Army Gen. Boris Gromov, who won fame for
commanding Soviet troops in Afghanistan while still in his 30s. He
is considered a hardliner, and a prime candidate for a high post in
the Defense Ministry, which Gorbachev also has promised to shake
up.
   Legislators who declined to be named said the Interior Ministry
post may be a means of keeping Gromov out of a top job at the
Defense Ministry.
   Simes speculated that Pugo's major task will be controlling his
new deputy.
   Bakatin previously has been mentioned as a possible candidate
for prime minister. He was nominated for president last spring, and
declined to run against Gorbachev.
   Alksnis accused Bakatin of allowing the break-down of the
ministry, the official news agency said.
   ``He is fully responsible for the blood spilt in Moldavia,''
Alksnis charged, referring to a series of violent confrontations
between separatist ethnic groups in that southwestern republic.
   ``Bakatin was not only passive, but he rendered concrete support
to separatist forces in the republics,'' Alksnis charged. The Soyuz
group sharply criticized Bakatin for allowing independence-minded
Estonia take control of its own Interior Ministry and police from
the central government.
   Reformist legislator Galina Starovoitova told Tass the reaction
in the republics to the changes may be ``extremely negative.'' She
said the Russian republic plans to demand that the functions of the
Interior Ministry be removed from the central government entirely.
   Gromov's appointment could mark a blow to the plans of several
republics to form their own militias. The army general has said
that allowing separate armies for each nationality would be
disastrous.
   Pugo, chairman of the Communist Party's Control Committee since
1988 and strong Gorbachev supporter, must be confirmed by the
Supreme Soviet legislature, Tass said.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A storm system that dumped more than a foot of snow on parts of
the upper Midwest and Great Lakes region moved eastward Monday,
while thunderstorms rumbled over the South.
   In hard-hit Iowa, high winds and heavy snows brought much of the
state to a standstill. Airports closed for part of the day in
Dubuque, Ottumwa and Sioux City. A plastic bubble covering the
University of Iowa's football workout field ripped open, but no
injuries were reported.
   Up to 14 inches of snow fell in central and southeast Iowa, with
drifts 2 to 4 feet deep. Winds gusting up to 56 mph whipped the
snow, leaving cars and trucks stranded along roadways.
   Snowfalls of as much as 10 inches fell across south-central
Wisconsin. Winds gusted up to 50 mph, leaving behind snow drifts up
to 6 feet deep. Up to a foot of snow fell in southeastern
Minnesota.
   The storm continued moving eastward later Monday, with up to 6
inches of snow falling in western New York. Winter storm warnings
were posted for Tuesday in northern Maine.
   Thunderstorms rumbled across the South Monday, extending from
southeast Louisiana across southern Mississippi and southwest
Alabama into the Florida Panhandle.
   Tornadoes touched down in Alabama. Five persons were injured and
mobile homes were destroyed in a tornado in northwest Harrison
County.
   Thunderstorm winds gusted to near 60 mph at Milton, Fla.
   Elsewhere, rain fell in Maryland, New Jersey, southern
Pennsylvania, Ohio, and southwestern lower Michigan, and freezing
rain was scattered over northwest Pennsylvania and other parts of
lower Michigan. Rain also dampened western Washington state,
changing to snow in higher elevations.
   The morning low in the Lower 48 states was 8 degrees below zero
at Gunnison, Colo.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 15
degrees at International Falls, Minn., to 88 degrees at El Cajon,
Calif.

<HEAD>Editorial Staff of Jerusalem Post Calls Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The editorial staff of the Jerusalem Post went
on strike Monday in protest over plans to dismiss 27 journalists.
   The dispute began when the management announced last month that
it intends to lay off 60 people, including the 27 news people, as
part of an effort to reduce manpower to pay old debts.
   But workers said the strike was called to fight what they called
an attempt to shatter its union.
   ``The management is trying to break the union by forcing some of
the workers to sign personal contracts in contradiction to a signed
agreement between the workers' committee and the management,'' said
a union spokesman who asked not to be identified.
   He said that publisher Yehuda Levy had abrogated a signed
agreement with the workers' committee by sending dismissal notices
to 27 journalists.
   ``They are presenting workers with ultimatums; either sign a
personal contract or leave,'' said the spokesman.
   He said that an agreement signed between the management and the
workers' committee stipulated that a maximum of 20 percent of the
staff could hold personal contracts.
   But the management, he said, told the committee Sunday that
everybody would have to be employed on personal contract basis.
   Israel television said that the newspaper would be published
Tuesday despite the strike.
   Publisher, Yehuda Levy, was not available to discuss the
workers' action or the intended dismissals. The newspaper's editor,
N. David Gross, refused to speak on the telephone and relayed a
message that if he had something to say he would put out a
statement.
   Gross, a 40-year veteran of the newspaper, was named its top
editor last February. He replaced Erwin Frenkel, who submitted his
resignation in last December in a dispute over editorial freedom
with the paper's new management.
   The Post, Israel's only English-language daily, was purchased
last year by the Canadian newspaper chain, Hollinger Inc.
   The paper has a daily circulation of about 25,000, but is widely
read by journalists and diplomats. The Post also prints an overseas
edition with a circulation of 50,000 and is starting a French
edition.
   More than 25 reporters quit the newspaper in support of Frenkel
and some have joined the new English-language weekly, The Jerusalem
Report.

   A doctor who invented a device that a
woman used to kill herself was charged with first-degree murder
Monday by a prosecutor who said he didn't want his county to become
a ``suicide mecca.''
   Janet Adkins, 54, of Portland, Ore., died June 4 after being
hooked to the device invented by Dr. Jack Kevorkian of Royal Oak.
She had been diagnosed in June 1989 with Alzheimer's disease.
   Kevorkian connected Adkins to an intravenous solution that would
stop her heart, but she activated the switch that allowed it to
flow into her veins.
   A recently completed toxicology report identified the solution
as the cause of death, Oakland County Prosecutor Richard Thompson
told reporters in announcing the charges. The autopsy also showed
the woman suffered from Alzheimer's disease.
   Kevorkian faced a court appearance on the charge.
   ``Dr. Kevorkian was the primary and legal cause of Janet Adkins'
death. He cannot avoid his criminal culpability by the clever use
of a switch,'' Thompson said. ``He constructed the suicide machine
for the sole purpose of causing death. He saw Janet Adkins for the
sole purpose of causing her death.''
   The criminal charges were filed one day before a civil trial in
Oakland County Circuit Court to determine whether Kevorkian could
have his machine back. It was confiscated after the woman's death.
   The timing of Thompson's charge angered Kevorkian's attorney,
Geoffrey Fieger, who said he had tried to find out from Thompson's
office what charges would be filed before the news conference.
   ``I find this to be a moral and legal outrage,'' Fieger said
after the charges were filed. ``It is an attempt by the prosecutor
to grandstand. It is an attempt by the prosecutor to institute
criminal proceedings to obtain an advantage in a civil case.''
   Fieger also said he was outraged at the first-degree murder
charge, which carries a possible life prison sentence on
conviction.
   ``He would like this to be the execution capital of the world,''
Fieger said, referring to Thompson's recent statements that he
would like to seek the death penalty for drug dealers. Michigan
does not have the death penalty.
   ``Yet he doesn't want terminally ill patients who seek a death
with dignity to be able to make that personal decision.''
   At his own news conference after Thompson's, Kevorkian referred
all questions to Fieger.
   Ronald Adkins, the victim's husband, said he had no immediate
comment about the charges.
   Ronald and Janet Adkins traveled from Oregon to meet with
Kevorkian after she was diagnosed as having Alzheimer's disease.
The couple belonged to the Hemlock Society, an organization that
promotes death on demand for the terminally ill.
   ``Janet Adkins was not terminally ill. She was not suffering any
pain,'' the prosecutor said. ``For me not to charge Dr. Kevorkian
would turn Oakland County into the suicide mecca of our nation.''
   Derek Humphry, executive director of the Eugene, Ore.-based
group, said he was surprised by the charges, since Michigan has no
law against assisting in suicide. Legislation that would outlaw
assisted suicide is pending.
   ``This will be quite a job getting a conviction, because the law
in Michigan is extremely ambiguous,'' Humphry said.
   Adkins had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in June 1989
at Good Samaritan Hospital in Portland, said hospital spokesman
Chuck Williams.
   ``People don't die of Alzheimer's. They die of other things
indirectly caused by Alzheimer's,'' Williams said. ``I'm sure what
the prosecutor was looking at was that she was under no direct
threat to her health. But if the autopsy confirmed Alzheimer's,
there's no question she would have died of the disease.''

<HEAD>Rebel Leader Dissolves Government Amid Calls for Democracy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>N'DJAMENA, Chad (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The rebel leader who marched nearly
unchallenged into the capital dissolved Chad's Parliament and
suspended the constitution Monday while promising a multiparty
democracy, Chad Radio reported.
   Idriss Deby, called by some the ``desert cowboy,'' did not
immediately assume the presidency, but his Popular Salvation
Movement was effectively in charge of the central African nation.
   Deby drove into the capital of N'Djamena on Sunday in a black
Mercedes after President Hissene Habre fled to neighboring
Cameroon.
   Deby was Habre's chief aide in a 1982 coup, but Deby broke away
last year and formed a rebel movement. Habre and U.S. officials
claim Libya funded Deby's rebellion, but the Libyans and Deby deny
it.
   Earlier Monday, Deby freed at least 450 Libyan prisoners of war.
   Cameroon state radio reported Monday that Habre and eight of his
ministers had taken refuge there. French government officials also
said they had information Habre was alive. The official Libyan news
agency, JANA, claimed Sunday that Habre had been killed.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said U.S.
officials believe Libya supplied Deby's rebels. The French press
also widely reported Libyan military aid to Deby.
   Ms. Tutwiler said Ambassador Richard W. Bogosian plans to meet
with Deby, 38.
   Chad Radio denounced the ``economic, moral and political chaos''
of the previous regime and ``the abuses of a delinquent dictator.''
   ``Habre was an obstacle in the way of national reconciliation
between Chadians and an obstacle to good neighborliness and the
bonds of history and common suffering between Libyans and
Chadians,'' JANA said.
   According to the constitution, adopted Dec. 10, 1989, the
National Assembly president becomes interim leader in Habre's
absense. But with the constitution suspended by Deby, there was no
president named and it was unclear how the post would be filled.
   France, Chad's former colonial ruler, had recognized Assembly
President Jean Alingue Bawayeu as the interim leader.
   Before dissolving the body, Deby met with Alingue. Other coup
leaders held talks with high-ranking officials of the deposed
government.
   ``My worry is not to be president of the republic,'' said Deby
after entering the capital. ``This country must become democratic,
pluralist. The moment has come to lay down our arms.''
   France, with nearly 1,800 troops in Chad, had backed Habre since
he came to power, but remained neutral in the latest conflict,
which started Nov. 10 in eastern Chad.
   Habre's forces last month were defeated in a series of battles.
On Friday, rebel troops entered the main eastern city of Abeche and
marched around French troops, who took no action.
   Libya's occupied northern Chad in 1983 and 1986, prompting
France to send troops to back Habre. Libya was driven out in a
series of lightning battles masterminded by Deby in 1987.
   Libya has demanded freedom for its captured soldiers and still
claims a mineral-rich strip of land in northern Chad. The POWs left
for Libya Monday.
   Rebels in all-terrain vehicles mounted with machine guns zoomed
through the city Monday, spreading their control from key
administrative buildings to working-class neighborhoods. French
troops guarded the airport and other key facilities, such as
telecommunications and electricity centers.
   N'Djamena was calm following weekend looting. A curfew remained
in effect.
   Habre was elected to a new seven-year term in June. It was the
first contested elections in 30 years of independence, but
candidates were limited to independents and members of Habre's
ruling party.
   French Foreign Legion troops helped organize the evacuation of
about 1,600 foreigners over the weekend. Most evacuees were French,
but about 50 American dependents were on the flights.

   A senior Senate colleague defended the
integrity of the Keating Five senators before the Ethics Committee
on Monday, while away from the hearing law enforcement sources said
the FBI was examining the lawmakers' conduct as well.
   Sen. Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii, told the ethics panel that the
five senators whose conduct is the subject of the hearings appeared
to be providing typical service to a constituent when they
intervened with savings and loan regulators on behalf of S&amp;L owner
Charles H. Keating Jr.
   Inouye specifically endorsed the conduct of Sen. Dennis
DeConcini, D-Ariz., who was described in prior testimony by
regulators as a negotiator for Keating in two 1987 meetings.
   Keating donated or raised $1.3 million for the five senators'
campaigns and causes.
   ``I do not believe Sen. DeConcini crossed the line'' between
proper and improper action, Inouye said, referring to DeConcini's
request that regulators waive a thrift regulation that was harming
Keating's Lincoln Savings and Loan. ``If it was improper, all of us
at one time or another have done that.''
   Inouye said he appeared as a defense witness, over the
objections of his staff, because ``I believe what is on trial here
is not the five colleagues of mine but the U.S. Senate, and for
that matter the Congress of the United States.''
   Meanwhile, law enforcement sources speaking only on condition of
anonymity, said the FBI is looking into the senators' conduct as
part of a wide-ranging investigation being coordinated with federal
prosecutors in Los Angeles and Phoenix.
   Examination of the senators' dealings with Keating is one aspect
of the broad federal criminal inquiry into allegations of financial
wrongdoing at Lincoln Savings and its parent American Continental
Corp.
   Justice Department officials declined to comment on a report in
Monday's Washington Times that the FBI is focusing on allegations
of vote trading and bribery against two of the senators, Democrats
Alan Cranston of California and DeConcini.
   The other members being investigated by the Senate Ethics
Committee are John Glenn, D-Ohio, Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich. and
John McCain, R-Ariz.
   DeConcini denounced the newspaper report, saying he had not been
questioned as part of a criminal investigation. ``I think I'm being
terrorized by such an article appearing,'' he said.
   DeConcini spokesman Robert Maynes said that last spring, the
senator gave to the FBI all the documents he submitted to the
Ethics Committee.
   ``This was in connection with the investigation of Keating,''
Maynes said. ``We turned it over in response to an FBI request.''
   Cranston's attorney, William Taylor, said Cranston was not ``the
target of a criminal investigation,'' but had provided information
requested by the Justice Department as part of its investigation
into Keating.
   At the ethics hearings, in their 10th day, Inouye was followed
by Cranston's former chief fund-raiser, who testified that ``in
retrospect I believe'' Keating linked his contributions to
Cranston's help for Lincoln.
   Joy Jacobson was asked by Cranston's attorney, ``Did Sen.
Cranston ever say to you, when the contributions were made, whether
it was expected he would act in any way for Keating or American
Continental?''
   ``No,'' she responded.
   Ms. Jacobson said she, not Cranston, was ``controlling the
timing'' of solicitations of Keating, adding she was unaware that
Cranston was contacting regulators for Keating at the same times.
   Earlier, Inouye told the Ethics Committee's six senators that
constituents who are also campaign contributors often ask for help
when they believe they are treated unfairly by federal agencies.
   He called the five senators ``men of unimpeachable character''
and added, ``If everything turned out well, if we did not have this
S&amp;L crisis, if Mr. Keating was once again able to revive (Lincoln
Savings and Loan) these men would be heroes to their constituents;
they were able to save jobs.''
   ``Today they are damned because the endeavor failed, so I think
we are on trial here, the U.S. Senate.''
   The Hawaii senator said, ``A constituent has every right to
expect service from us even if the case is not a good one.''
   But he added that if a senator took an action that was
specifically tied to a contribution, ``then it not only is
inappropriate, but is a violation of the law.''

<HEAD>Administration Forecasts Steady Trade Deficit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration Monday predicted in a
report to Congress that the U.S. trade deficit would remain steady
even though Americans are paying sharply more for imported oil.
   Prepared by the Treasury Department as a requirement of the 1988
trade law, the report also indicated that a further decline in the
value of the dollar was not needed to improve the nation's trade
balance.
   It predicted ``a sustaining of the progress'' made in reducing
the current account deficit, which is the broadest measure of trade
and includes investment flows.
   The deficit has dropped from a peak of $162 billion in 1987 to
$129 billion in 1988 and $110 billion in 1989. During the first six
months of 1990, it ran at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $87
billion.
   The U.S. deficit and Japanese and German surpluses ``are being
further reduced this year, despite repeated prognostications that
the external adjustment process had come to a halt and that
balances would resume widening,'' the report said.
   International Monetary Fund forecast indicate the U.S. deficit
will remain below $100 billion next year, despite the run-up in oil
prices, the report said. However, it noted that the standoff in the
Persian Gulf between the United States and Iraq made predictions
more uncertain than usual.
   ``I don't view that as tremendous news,'' said economist Robert
G. Dederick of Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. ``A number that is
stalling out at around $100 billion is still a problem.''
   Moreover, he and other economists said the prediction likely
would prove true only if the price of oil falls next year and if
economy topples into a recession, as many analysts believe is
happening.
   ``My guess is the Treasury Department is right for the wrong
reasons,'' said economist Michael K. Evans, who heads a Washington
consulting firm. ``Trade deficits always narrow in a recession
because people buy fewer imports.''
   The report's stance on the dollar reflects a shift in the
thinking of administration officials, who as recently as two months
ago expressed little concern with the currency's decline so long as
it was orderly.
   A lower dollar helps the U.S. trade deficit by making American
goods cheaper abroad and foreign goods more expensive in the United
States.
   However, a falling dollar encourages inflation in the United
States by reducing Americans' spending power. It also tends to push
up the interest rate foreign investors demand to finance the U.S.
budget deficit.
   When the Treasury last issued its trade report, in April,
officials were concerned about the advance of the dollar against
the Japanese yen. But since then, the dollar has fallen 18 percent
against the yen and is trading near post-World War II lows against
the German mark.
   The report said, ``Further adjustment of external imbalances
should rely primarily on macroeconomic and structural policy
measures, rather than on further exchange rate adjustment.''
   ``Macroeconomic and structural policy measures'' is a reference
to U.S. efforts to cut its budget deficit, reducing the need for
foreign funds, and German and Japanese efforts to stimulate
consumer demand for U.S. goods.
   Evans and Dederick said the administration's shift toward
supporting the dollar was made to counteract foreign disappointment
with the five-year budget deficit reduction pact enacted at the end
of October.
   The report said the deficit reduction pact ``demonstrates the
United States' commitment to putting its economic house in order,''
but Dederick said, ``This is not viewed abroad as very
meaningful.''

   The House re-elected its leaders on Monday,
the Democrats by acclamation and the Republicans by aggravation.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., Majority Leader Richard
A. Gephardt, D-Mo., and Majority Whip William H. Gray III, D-Pa.,
all will return to their jobs for the 102nd Congress. They were
unopposed, and received standing ovations from the Democratic
Caucus.
   On the Republican side, Minority Leader Robert H. Michel,
R-Ill., and Minority Whip Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., also had no
opponents.
   But the No. 3 Republican, Jerry Lewis of California, and the
party campaign chairman, Guy Vander Jagt, R-Mich., both survived
only after bitterly fought campaigns.
   Lewis was challenged by Rep. Carl Pursell, R-Mich., a moderate
who received heavy behind-the-scenes support from Gingrich and his
allies.
   Lewis and Gingrich are the most talked-about contestants for the
job of Republican leader when Michel retires, possibly in 1992.
   During this year's budget battle, Lewis backed President Bush
while Gingrich bolted and helped bring down the president's
compromise package that included higher taxes. Pursell and the
Gingrich group tried to oust Lewis in part because of his stance on
that issue.
   Lewis prevailed 98-64 and then appeared to fire the first shot
in the expected 1992 race to succeed Michel. The outcome, he told
reporters, was ``somewhat of a disaster'' for Gingrich and his
allies. ``Their purpose was not to help Carl Pursell but to dump
Jerry Lewis,'' he said.
   Pursell, asked what Gingrich's support did for him, said merely,
``I think Newt has been somewhat hurt by his election back home.''
Gingrich was re-elected to Congress by less than one percent of the
vote.
   Gingrich, however, declared victory.
   ``It was clear that the conference wants a more activist
conference. That's part of why he had a challenge. I suspect you'll
see Jerry being a little bit more active,'' Gingrich said.
   Vander Jagt withstood an assault from Rep. Don Sundquist,
R-Tenn., who had to repeatedly deny charges he was put up to
running by the White House.
   Sundquist accused Vander Jagt of allowing mismanagement and
cronyism at the Republican National Campaign Committee, and Vander
Jagt promised a review.
   The vote in their contest was 98-66.
   The Democrats caucused Monday without Bernie Sanders, the
Vermont socialist who had sought to organize with the Democratic
party to obtain his committee assignments.
   Foley told reporters afterward that the Democrats, as the
majority party, would find Sanders a committee assignment but not
as part of their caucus.

<HEAD>State Says Ambassador's Remarks Not US Position</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. ambassador to China's description of
anti-China demonstrators as ``cowards'' was a ``spontaneous
remark'' that does not represent his position or the government's,
the State Department said Monday.
   ``We're all human beings,'' said Margaret Tutwiler, commenting
on the remark by James Lilley.
   Lilley, who made the comments Saturday night in Seattle,
apologized for the comment. He said protesters opposed to China's
human rights policies provoked him by calling him an obscene name.
   ``It was a mistake in the first place,'' Lilley said of the
incident before he addressed Chinese and American delegates at the
conclusion of a three-day Sino-U.S. trade conference. ``I shouldn't
have done it.''
   Lilley, who left Seattle on Sunday for Tokyo, made the comments
in a brief interview with the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.
   ``The ambassador's spontaneous remark does not represent the
considered views of the United States government, nor indeed of
Ambassador Lilley himself as he clearly articulated in his speech
later that day,'' Tutwiler said.
   ``No one appreciates better than Ambassador Lilley the challenge
of working for reform and human rights in China,'' she said.
   She said Lilley would not be reprimanded.
   Lilley got into Saturday night's argument with a handful of
demonstrators when he arrived with Chinese Ambassador Zhu Quizhen.
About 50 demonstrators waved signs and chanted slogans condemning
the attack on pro-democracy demonstrators at Tiananmen Square and
China's 40-year occupation of Tibet.
   Jim Berman, 32, whose wife is Tibetan, said he and a half-dozen
others left the main group on the chance the ambassadors might use
a side entrance.
   They chanted ``China - human rights!'', ``Tibet for Tibetans!'',
and ``Remember Tiananmen Square!'' he said.
   Zhu ignored the demonstrators and went inside, Berman said.
   But Berman said, and a videotape corroborated, that Lilley
suddenly shouted, ``Were you at Tiananmen Square? I was there.''
   ``You're a bunch of cowards,'' Lilley yelled, looking back at a
35-year-old Tibetan whom he apparently mistook for a Chinese. ``You
go back to China and serve China.''
   China invaded Tibet in 1950, crushed an uprising in 1959 and
introduced repressive measures, including suppressing Tibetan
Buddhism.
   The 63-year-old Lilley, who was born in China, was appointed to
the ambassadorship by President Bush. He is a former CIA
intelligence officer and former ambassador to South Korea, and also
has served U.S. missions in the Philippines, Taiwan, Cambodia,
Laos, Thailand and Hong Kong.

   A key to what caused two Northwest Airlines
jets to collide on the ground at Detroit's airport Monday could lie
in the communications between the control tower and both pilots.
   National Transportation Safety Board investigators will analyze
tapes which record cockpit conversations as well as all
communications between federal air traffic controllers in the tower
and planes on the ground and in the air around the airport.
   ``Planes are not supposed to move on the ground unless air
traffic controllers say they can,'' said NTSB spokesman Ted
Lopatkiewicz. ``The tower has direct control.''
   The only discretion a pilot has on the ground at an airport is
the option of aborting his takeoff once clearance for takeoff is
given, Lopatkiewicz said.
   He said, however, it was too early to reach any conclusions
about the Detroit accident. Investigators will look at all aspects
of pilot and controller actions, aircraft construction, airport
design and other factors that might have contributed to the
accident.
   Federal Aviation Administration officials at first said the
wingtips of the Boeing 727 and DC-9 struck as they were taxiing for
takeoff. But a Northwest officials said the wing of the 727 sliced
into the tail end of the DC-9, taking off one of its two
rear-mounted engines.
   At least 19 passengers died as the DC9 burned and both planes
were evacuated.
   Ordinarily Federal Aviation Administration controllers in the
airport tower can see all the planes on the approach to runways at
major airports, but a winter storm had just moved through the
Detroit area and it was foggy at the time of the collision.
   The airport was closed to inbound traffic.
   Lopatkiewicz said investigators would obtain and analyze both
control tower and cockpit tapes as soon as possible. The control
tower tapes of radio communications eventually may be aired
publicly, but only edited transcripts will be made public for the
on-board recorders which are made from microphones in the planes'
cockpits.

   A doctor who invented a device that a
woman used to kill herself was charged with first-degree murder
Monday by a prosecutor who said he didn't want his county to become
a ``suicide mecca.''
   Janet Adkins, 54, of Portland, Ore., died June 4 after being
hooked to the device invented by Dr. Jack Kevorkian of Royal Oak.
She had been diagnosed in June 1989 with Alzheimer's disease.
   Kevorkian connected Adkins to an intravenous solution that would
stop her heart, but she activated the switch that allowed it to
flow into her veins.
   A recently completed toxicology report identified the solution
as the cause of death, Oakland County Prosecutor Richard Thompson
told reporters in announcing the charges. The autopsy also showed
the woman suffered from Alzheimer's disease.
   Kevorkian, 52, was arraigned Monday and ordered jailed in lieu
of $150,000 bail.
   ``Dr. Kevorkian was the primary and legal cause of Janet Adkins'
death. He cannot avoid his criminal culpability by the clever use
of a switch,'' Thompson said. ``He constructed the suicide machine
for the sole purpose of causing death. He saw Janet Adkins for the
sole purpose of causing her death.''
   The criminal charges were filed one day before a civil trial in
Oakland County Circuit Court to determine whether Kevorkian could
have his machine back. It was confiscated after the woman's death.
   The timing of Thompson's charge angered Kevorkian's attorney,
Geoffrey Fieger, who said he had tried to find out from Thompson's
office what charges would be filed before the news conference.
   ``I find this to be a moral and legal outrage,'' Fieger said
after the charges were filed. ``It is an attempt by the prosecutor
to grandstand. It is an attempt by the prosecutor to institute
criminal proceedings to obtain an advantage in a civil case.''
   Fieger also said he was outraged at the first-degree murder
charge, which carries a possible life prison sentence on
conviction.
   ``He would like this to be the execution capital of the world,''
Fieger said, referring to Thompson's recent statements that he
would like to seek the death penalty for drug dealers. Michigan
does not have the death penalty.
   ``Yet he doesn't want terminally ill patients who seek a death
with dignity to be able to make that personal decision.''
   At his own news conference after Thompson's, Kevorkian referred
all questions to Fieger.
   Ronald Adkins, the victim's husband, said he had no immediate
comment about the charges.
   Ronald and Janet Adkins traveled from Oregon to meet with
Kevorkian after she was diagnosed as having Alzheimer's disease.
The couple belonged to the Hemlock Society, an organization that
promotes death on demand for the terminally ill.
   ``Janet Adkins was not terminally ill. She was not suffering any
pain,'' the prosecutor said. ``For me not to charge Dr. Kevorkian
would turn Oakland County into the suicide mecca of our nation.''
   Derek Humphry, executive director of the Eugene, Ore.-based
group, said he was surprised by the charges, since Michigan has no
law against assisting in suicide. Legislation that would outlaw
assisted suicide is pending.
   ``This will be quite a job getting a conviction, because the law
in Michigan is extremely ambiguous,'' Humphry said.
   Adkins had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in June 1989
at Good Samaritan Hospital in Portland, said hospital spokesman
Chuck Williams.
   ``People don't die of Alzheimer's. They die of other things
indirectly caused by Alzheimer's,'' Williams said. ``I'm sure what
the prosecutor was looking at was that she was under no direct
threat to her health. But if the autopsy confirmed Alzheimer's,
there's no question she would have died of the disease.''

   Robert Cummings, film star and
bachelor-about-town in television comedies of the 1950s, has died.
   Cummings, who had Parkinson's disease, died Sunday night at the
Motion Picture and Television Hospital in Woodland Hills of kidney
failure and complications from pneumonia, said hospital spokeswoman
Louella Benson.
   Studio biographies and family sources gave conflicting ages for
Cummings of 80 and 82.
   ``He was a darling man,'' said Milton Berle, who worked with
Cummings during the 1930s and '40s.
   Cummings accompanied Berle to Hollywood in 1932 for a screen
test with Paramount Pictures. The movie company signed Cummings but
passed on Berle.
   ``I never let him forget that,'' Berle said.
   Following a successful film career in the 1940s, Cummings
entered the burgeoning TV industry, appearing in dramas and his own
shows, including two incarnations of ``The Bob Cummings Show.''
   In 1954, he won an Emmy for ``Twelve Angry Men.''
   On ``The Bob Cummings Show,'' which ran as a sitcom on NBC and
CBS from 1955 to 1959, Cummings played Bob Collins, a photographer
with his own airplane who squired beautiful models around town. He
could never settle on one woman, causing endless problems at home
and among the various girlfriends.
   On the program, he also played his grandfather, Josh Collins,
who never lost his eye for the ladies despite his age. The series,
probably the closest thing to a sex comedy on television at the
time, was known as ``Love that Bob'' in syndication.
   The program was revived as ``The New Bob Cummings Show,'' a
comedy-adventure for a 1961-62 run on CBS. Cummings played Bob
Carson, charter pilot and amateur detective.
   Most of Cummings' film roles were light comedies but included
some serious portrayals, such as in ``Kings Row,'' in which he
co-starred with Ronald Reagan, and in ``Dial M for Murder,'' Alfred
Hitchcock's 1954 thriller.
   One of Cummings' last public appearances was last month in
Fulton, Mo., where he attended Reagan's dedication at Westminster
College of the sculpture ``Breakthrough,'' fashioned from sections
of the Berlin Wall. The college is where Winston Churchill made his
Iron Curtain speech in 1946.
   Born in Joplin, Mo., in 1910 to a minister and his wife,
Cummings studied engineering and business before turning to the
theater to earn money for his family during the Depression.
   He started his acting career in England and passed himself off
as British, calling himself Blade Stanhope-Conway. To help
establish his credentials, he even bribed a London stagehand to
take his picture under a marquee bearing his alias.
   He then returned to the United States, where he worked as a
straight man for Berle and co-starred with Fanny Brice in ``The
Ziegfeld Follies.''
   Cummings got his first film role in 1935, adopting a Texas
accent to play opposite Margaret Sullavan in ``So Red the Rose.''
   His other movie parts included ``The Devil and Miss Jones'' in
1941, ``The Bride Wore Boots'' in 1946 and ``For Heaven's Sake'' in
1950.
   After retiring from show business, Cummings became a ardent
believer in the power of health food and astrology. Preserving his
youthful looks even into his later years, Cummings wrote a book on
nutrition called ``How To Stay Young and Vital.''
   Berle said he last saw Cummings in early November when they met
for lunch at the Friars Club in Beverly Hills.
   ``He didn't look like the Bob I knew,'' Berle said. ``He looked
ill.''
   Cummings is survived by his fifth wife, Janie, whom he married
in August 1989. The actor had seven children and nine
grandchildren.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

   Air force planes bombed two
columns of rebel tanks Monday in a bid to put down the final
remnants of a failed rebellion. The uprising left at least eight
people dead two days before President Bush was to visit.
   The rebel tanks were rendered ``useless,'' the local news agency
Noticias Argentinas reported.
   Earlier, hundreds of rebels were forced out of a tank factory,
an infantry base, several coast guard buildings and another army
installation in the fourth uprising by the restive Argentine
military in as many years.
   In contrast to three uprisings under then-President Raul
Alfonsin, President Carlos Menem and army chief Gen. Martin Bonnet
refused to negotiate with rebels who demanded a shake-up of the
high command and a bigger military budget.
   Menem, in his 16th month of power, early Monday declared a
nationwide state of siege that suspended constitutional guarantees
and gave him sweeping powers to ensure public order. He threatened
to declare martial law, under which rebels could be executed.
   By 8 p.m., the only remaining rebel stronghold was army
headquarters in downtown Buenos Aires, two blocks from Government
House.
   The planes attacked two tanks moving along a highway in the
capital, and about a dozen traveling in neighboring Entre Rios
Province.
   Casualties were not disclosed, but at least three soldiers and
five civilians died as a result of the rebellion. Five people died
and at least 20 were injured elsewhere in this city when a tank
collided with a bus.
   Eight soldiers were injured, the army said, along with at least
10 civilians, including three reporters, according to news reports.
   Despite the insurrection, Bush said from Brasilia that he
planned to arrive as scheduled on Wednesday.
   White House spoksman Marlin Fitzwater said it seemed likely the
incident was intended to embarrass Menem before Bush's visit.
   ``It's also the reason we want to make clear our support for
democracy and President Menem,'' Fitzwater said.
   U.S. officials indicated they did not consider the uprising to
be a serious threat to the Menem government.
   ``This is not a coup,'' a rebel spokesman told reporters. ``We
recognize the authority of President Menem as commander in chief.''
   The army estimated the rebels numbered 200. The rebels claimed
they had 700 followers.
   The rebels said rather then trying to overthrow the government
that they were seeking changes in the way the military is run.
   The uprising began before dawn when rebels, their faces
blackened commando-style, took over several floors at army
headquarters. About the same time, other rebels seized the Palermo
infantry base and the tank factory.
   Bonnet demanded in a nationwide TV and radio broadcast that
rebels surrender unconditionally or the army would ``suffocate''
them.
   About 45 rebels surrendered in the port along the River Plate
after failing to take over coast guard headquarters, presidential
spokesman Humberto Toledo said.
   Another 98 - including rebel leader Col. Enrique Baraldini -
were arrested at the Palermo infantry base five miles to the
northwest, the scene of some of the heaviest shooting, the army
said.
   About 60 rebels were captured by soldiers of the Military School
at a batallion on the outskirts of Buenos Aires after several
morter rounds were fired.
   ``The last areas of conflict very rapidly are going to end,''
presidential Toledo told state-run ATC Channel 7 TV.
   Nevertheless, by late afternoon rebels remained holed up inside
army headquarters - a multistory office building where the chiefs
of staff meet - two blocks behind Government House.
   A group of about 12 rebel tanks was prevented from crossing the
Parana River into Buenos Aires Province.
   Earlier, the insurgents ignored a demand by Bonnet for an
unconditional surrender, and indicated they were loyal to a colonel
who led the last uprising, in December 1988.
   ``Within the army, we don't recognize any other legitimite
authority than that of Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin,'' retired Maj.
Huge Abete, a spokesman for the rebels, told reporters. Seineldin
has been under military arrest since Oct. 22.
   Banks were ordered closed and federal employees sent home. The
stock exchange closed early, and federal police prohibited public
gatherings across the country.
   Roads in this capital city of 11 million people were blocked,
and Newbery metropolitan airport was closed.
   The Government House, the Economy Ministry and Vice President
Eduardo Duhalde's helicopter were struck by bullets. Duhalde was
not injured.
   Bushy's top State Department aide on Latin America, Bernard
Aronson, said the situation in Argentina was ``all right.''
   ``I don't know if it's entirely over, but it doesn't sound too
serious. There's a small group in the military that has certain
grievances and every once in while something like this happens,''
said Aronson, who was traveling with the president.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said the military takeover ``appears to be an internal military
matter'' involving military salaries.
   Brazil condemned the revolt as a step backward for democracy in
Latin America.
   ``This episode provokes deep disgust,'' Foreign Minister
Francisco Rezek told reporters. ``We did not imagine that at this
high moment for democracy in Latin America such things could still
occur.''
   In April 1987 and January 1988, then-Lt. Col. Aldo Rico led
barracks revolts to halt the trials of officers accused of human
rights abuses during the 1976-83 dictatorship. Rico and his
followers also wanted generals to retire and the government to
increase the military budget.
   He was imprisoned and cashiered. But following the revolts, most
trials were halted, military pay was increased and a number of
generals did retire.
   Seineldin's insurrection had similar motives and results. He was
denied promotion to general and forced to retire.

<TEXT>
   President Bush is consolidating the hold of
conservative Republicans on the federal judiciary that began during
the eight years of the Reagan administration, a liberal advocacy
group said Monday.
   The Alliance For Justice, which last summer opposed the
confirmation of Supreme Court Judge David H. Souter, said in a
year-end report that Bush is continuing President Reagan's legacy
of naming hard-line conservatives to the federal bench.
   ``Through its judicial choices, the Bush administration is
waging war on the notion of a fair and representative federal
judiciary,'' Nan Aron, the group's president said in a statement.
   ``Nominees to the federal bench continue the Reagan
administration's tradition of hostility toward individual rights
and restricting access to the courts,'' Aron said.
   The alliance's report also criticized the Senate Judiciary
Committee for accelerating the confirmation process, therefore,
``providing less time for senators to consider the qualifications
of each nominee and for the general public to participate. '
   ``President Bush is changing the legal landscape,'' Aron said.
``It is up to the Senate Judiciary Committee and the public to
ensure that the legal rights of the disadvantaged are not trampled
in the process.''
   The report noted that the Senate gave quick approval in the
closing days of the Congress to the nomination of a former aide to
Sen. Strom Thurmond, the ranking GOP member of the Judiciary
Committee.
   Just 10 days after he was nominated, Dennis Shedd was confirmed
for a district court judgeship in Thurmond's home state of South
Carolina despite a lack of experience as a courtroom lawyer and a
low rating from the American Bar Association.
   The alliance's report was issued two days after Bush signed into
law a bill that creates 85 new federal judgeships. Besides these
newly created slots, there are 41 vacancies on the federal bench
vacancies that Bush will soon have an opportunity to fill.
   ``President Bush is following the course of his predecessor in
choosing appellate judges with dependably conservative records, and
in the next two years ... he will have the opportunity to tilt the
balance even more,'' the report said.
   Bush promoted many district judges appointed by Reagan to
circuit court seats - positions ``where ideology is most apt to
influence judicial decisionmaking,'' the report said.
   Fifteen of the 23 nominees Bush proposed for federal circuit
courts were district court judges that Reagan had first appointed
to the federal bench, the report said.
   The report also faulted Bush for failing to live up to promises
to appoint more qualified women and minorities to the federal
bench.
   Women have accounted for 11.6 percent of Bush's appointments to
the federal judiciary, compared to 15.5 percent under President
Carter. Women accounted for 8.2 percent of Reagan's appointees, the
report said.
   Bush has appointed only three blacks - 3.8 percent of his
nominations so far - compared to 37 named by Carter. Reagan
appointed eight blacks - 2.1 percent of his nominees - to the
federal judiciary.

   The leader of the main anti-communist
coalition plans to step down, but reports conflicted whether the
move was prompted by rumors he was linked to the former Marxist
regime, BTA news agency said Monday.
   Petar Beron, chairman of the coordinating council of the
16-party Union of Democratic Forces, also plans to quit as UDF
parliamentary floor leader, the state news agency added.
   It quoted Filip Dimitrov, Beron's deputy, as saying Beron
announced his intentions late Monday at a regional UDF meeting. No
date for the resignation was announced.
   Beron, 51, said he was leaving to resume work as a zoologist,
BTA reported. The group's spokesman, Mihail Nedelchev, also denied
Beron was quiting because of ``discrediting connections'' to the
former hard-line Communist leadership.
   But BTA cited an unidentified senior member of Beron's group as
saying there was confirmation of rumors Beron had ties to the
former regime.
   It gave no details of the alleged connections.
   The Union of Democratic Forces played a key role in forcing the
resignation of Premier Andrei Lukanov and his government of former
Communists. Parliament approved the resignation Friday following a
boycott of the legislature by Beron's group, street demonstrations
and a burgeoning national strike.
   Lukanov and his ministers were all Socialists, the renamed
Communist Party that won June elections but saw its popularity
erode as economic problems grew. The government has had to ration
basic foods and energy.
   Talks are in progress on proposals to form a coalition
government.

   A jetliner clipped another while preparing
to take off from the Detroit airport in heavy fog Monday, igniting
a fire that killed at least 19 people and left one plane in smoking
ruins.
   At least 20 people were injured in the collision between a DC-9
and a Boeing 727-200, both operated by Northwest Airlines. Although
it was not immediately clear how the collision occurred, a
spokesman for air traffic controllers said the DC-9 appeared to
have become lost on a slick, foggy taxiway and strayed into the
727's path.
   For nearly an hour after the accident, smoke billowed out of the
fuselage of the DC-9, where passengers apparently became trapped by
the fast-moving fire. By the time the fire was extinguished, much
of the plane's roof was open to the overcast sky.
   The DC-9, Flight 1482 to Pittsburgh, was carrying 39 passengers
and four crewmembers, according to the airline. The 727, Flight 299
to Memphis, was carrying 146 passengers.
   Both flights had originated in Detroit, said Patrick McCann, a
Northwest spokesman at its headquarters in Egan, Minn.
   ``Apparently the right wing of the 727 hit the aft section, the
engine, of the DC9, taking the engine off,'' said Alan Muncaster,
another Northwest spokesman. ``That resulted in the fire. That, at
this point, is all we know.''
   At the time of the crash, visibility was poor and the ground was
wet from a morning snow and sleet storm that delayed flights at
Detroit Metropolitan Airport. Muncaster said the airport had been
closed to inbound traffic but that planes were being allowed to
take off.
   Tony Dresden, a spokesman for the National Air Traffic
Controllers Association, a union representing air traffic
controllers, said there was about a quarter-mile visibility in the
air, but only about 800 feet on the ground.
   ``We've had some discussions with our people out there,''
Dresden said. ``The DC-9 pilot became lost on the runways. The
pilot gave the ground controller erroneous information about his
position and turned right onto the runway where the 727 was
taxiing.
   ``The DC-9 pilot discovered at the very last moment where he
was, and so the ground controller told him to immediately get off
that runway, but it was too late.''
   He stressed that his information was preliminary. The Federal
Aviation Administration, which supervises air traffic controllers,
did not immediately comment about Dresden's statement.
   Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board were
being dispatched to begin a probe aimed at determining the cause of
the accident, a safety board spokesman said.
   One survivor from the DC-9, 41-year-old John Izzo, said he was
dozing when he ``heard a bang, felt a thud and then all of a
sudden, there was a blast.''
   ``I saw the fire to the right rear. The whole top burned away,
but something was definitely blown away because something flew over
my head,'' said Izzo, a Westinghouse nuclear engineer who was
returning to Pittsburgh from a business trip.
   Izzo said he escaped by jumping from a wing to the ground. He
was not hurt
   ``The people that made it down and out were crawling through the
slush into the middle of the field,'' he said. ``I just watched the
fire spread across the plane and engulf the entire fuselage.''
   Izzo said he was seated in Row 10 and believes people in the
rows behind him could not get out.
   The body of the 727 did not appear to have been seriously
damaged in the collision. One passenger, 60-year-old Robert Karp of
Jackson, Miss., said passengers from the 727 walked off the plane
and down the stairs.
   ``It sounded to me like it was a loud thump,'' said Karp, a
professor at Jackson State University.
   ``I thought the tire had blown out. The front end of the plane
had begun to lift off. I don't think the back wheels were off the
ground yet. As soon as I heard the thump we came to an abrupt stop.
I remember looking at the other plane and seeing smoke rolling
out.''
   Three men who earlier had identified themselves as pilots were
sitting across the aisle from him. One of them said, ``Oh, my God,
our entire wing is gone,'' according to Karp.
   Wayne County Executive Edward McNamara said the only injuries on
the Boeing were those that occurred during the plane's evacuation.
He did not say how many people were injured on the DC-9, but said
there were survivors.
   Linda Kalinsky of the Taylor Ambulance Co. said there were 50 or
60 injuries altogether, including some burn victims.
   Twenty people were taken to four hospitals in the area,
including two who were taken to the University of Michigan Medical
Center Burn Center at Ann Arbor.
   Muncaster said surviving passengers were taken to the airport
Marriot hotel.
   A family center was opened at a Ramada Inn about a mile from the
scene.
   As dusk settled in around 4 p.m., a stand of huge lights were
wheeled into place near the cockpit of the DC-9 on Runway 3C to
allow firefighters and investigators to see.
   At about 5 p.m., rescue workers hoisted body bags from the DC-9
and handed them to others on a wing.
   McNamara said 12 bodies were ``recognizable''; other bodies were
in the plane. The bodies would likely be taken to a morgue in
downtown Detroit.
   Romulus, about 10 miles west of Detroit, was the site of the
second worst air crash in U.S. history, the Aug. 16, 1987, crash of
a Northwest MD-80, on takeoff in which 156 people were killed.

   The city's best-known harbinger of Christmas,
the tree at Rockefeller Center, was set aglow Monday to the oohs
and ahs of thousands of spectators who were undeterred by cold and
rainy weather.
   The 20,000 multicolored lights adorning the 75-foot Norway
spruce that towers over the skating rink were turned on about 5:30
p.m.
   The half-hour ceremony accompanying the tree lighting featured
singer-actress Liza Minnelli as host, with appearances by skating

Robin Cousins; Minnelli's sister, singer Lorna Luft; and a segment
from the Radio City Musical Hall Christmas Spectacular.
   Clara ``Mother'' Hale, founder of Hale House, a home for infants
born to drug-addicted mothers, delivered a Christmas message.
   The tree, selected from a private home in West Norwalk, Conn.,
arrived at Rockefeller Center on Nov. 16. For the past two weeks,
workers have been readying the tree, stringing more than 5 miles of
lights.
   The tree, the 58th to appear at the site, will remain until Jan.

   The last of several hundred
rebels who tried to force a shake-up of the army high command and
pressure the government for a bigger military budget surrendered
Monday, the government news agency reported.
   The surrender puts an end to the fourth rebel uprising in as
many years in Argentina, where democracy was restored in 1983 after
nearly eight years of harsh military rule.
   Telem, the government news agency, said the surrender ended a
day-long series of firefights between loyalist troops and army
rebels in and near this capital city of nearly 11 million
residents. At one point, air force planes bombed a column of rebel
tanks on public roads.
   Casualties were not immediately disclosed, but at least three
soldiers and five civilians died in Argentina's fourth military
insurrection in four years. The civilians were in a bus hit by a
tank.
   Twenty people were injured in that crash, Telam reported. Eight
soldiers were shot and wounded, the army said, along with at least
10 civilians, local news agencies reported.
   The government of President Carlos Menem declared a state of
siege as the uprising unfolded in the morning.
   The insurrection occurred two days before the scheduled visit of
President Bush to this country of 32 million residents.
   Bush, in Brazil, said he had no plans to cancel the trip.
   White House spoksman Marlin Fitzwater said it seemed likely the
incident was intended to embarrass Menem before Bush's visit.
   ``It's also the reason we want to make clear our support for
democracy and President Menem,'' Fitzwater said.
   U.S. officials indicated they did not consider the uprising to
be a serious threat to the Menem government.
   ``This is not a coup,'' a rebel spokesman told reporters. ``We
recognize the authority of President Menem as commander in chief.''
   The army estimated the rebels numbered 200. The rebels claimed
they had 700 followers.
   The rebels said rather then trying to overthrow the government
that they were seeking changes in the way the military is run.
   The uprising began before dawn when rebels, their faces
blackened commando-style, took over several floors at army
headquarters. About the same time, other rebels seized the Palermo
infantry base and the tank factory.
   Army chief Gen. Martin Bonnet demanded in a nationwide TV and
radio broadcast that rebels surrender unconditionally or the army
would ``suffocate'' them.
   About 45 rebels surrendered in the port along the River Plate
after failing to take over coast guard headquarters, presidential
spokesman Humberto Toledo said.
   Another 98 - including rebel leader Col. Enrique Baraldini -
were arrested at the Palermo infantry base five miles to the
northwest, the scene of some of the heaviest shooting, the army
said.
   About 60 rebels were captured by soldiers of the Military School
at a batallion on the outskirts of Buenos Aires after several
morter rounds were fired.
   ``The last areas of conflict very rapidly are going to end,''
presidential Toledo told state-run ATC Channel 7 TV.
   In April 1987 and January 1988, then-Lt. Col. Aldo Rico led
barracks revolts to halt the trials of officers accused of human
rights abuses during the 1976-83 dictatorship. Rico and his
followers also wanted generals to retire and the government to
increase the military budget.
   He was imprisoned and cashiered. But following the revolts, most
trials were halted, military pay was increased and a number of
generals did retire.
   Seineldin's insurrection had similar motives and results. He was
denied promotion to general and forced to retire.

<HEAD>Ershad Offers to Quit in Bangladesh, But Opposition Demands `Now!'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Hussain Muhammad Ershad
offered on Monday to resign early after his state of emergency
failed to halt street fighting. But opposition leaders spurned his
offer and said he must quit now.
   The 60-year-old former army general said in a speech on
state-run TV he was willing to resign 45 days before presidential
elections are held in June 1991.
   Ershad, who took power in a 1982 bloodless coup, also offered to
dissolve Parliament, revoke the emergency on Dec. 16, and hand over
power to a nominee of the opposition before parliamentary and
presidential elections are held.
   But the opposition quickly rejected Ershad's surprise offer. It
accuses Ershad and his People's Party of rigging votes in previous
elections. It wants a caretaker government installed before new
elections to prevent any repetition of what they call vote fraud.
   ``We want Ershad's immediate resignation,'' said Kamal Haider,
spokesman for Bangladesh's major opposition alliances. ``He has not
announced any timeframe for the elections and thus he intends to
buy time to hoodwink the opposition. This is not acceptable.''
   Opposition parties called 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. nationwide strikes
every day beginning Tuesday to keep up pressure on Ershad.
   The opposition says troops killed at least 100 political
activists since the emergency was imposed on Nov. 27, and at least
1,500 people were injured. The government says six people have
died.
   The president's announcement came hours after further violent
protests against the emergency. In the port of Chittagong, 125
miles southeast of Dhaka, troops fired on rioting students and at
least 50 people were injured, witnesses said.
   Reporters in Chittagong said about 1,000 students hurled
homemade bombs at police and attacked vehicles, injuring at least
six officers. One officer lost both eyes in a bomb blast, they
said.
   The injured in Chittagong included a policeman who lost both
eyes in a bomb blast and five other members of the security forces,
reporters said. Like the witnesses, the reporters spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Chittagong, with about 2 million people, is the second-largest
city in Bangladesh. Dhaka, the capital, has about 7 million
residents.
   Ershad said Monday he was willing to hold elections to
Parliament and the presidency simultaneously.
   The opposition campaign was focused on holding fair elections,
the president said, adding:
   ``I'm willing to hold free and fair elections and give democracy
an institutional shape.
   ``I firmly believe that the country is above an individual or
party. Noble politics demands that we place the interest of the
nation above everything else. Today is the historic day to initiate
the noble process.''
   Ershad imposed a state of emergency, forbidding people to
assemble, and suspended all civil rights six weeks after the
often-violent opposition campaign began.
   The government also lifted press censorship Monday, imposed
along with the emergency. The Information Ministry credited ``the
improvement of the overall situation in the country.''
   Journalists have been on strike since Nov. 27 over the emergency
and no newspapers have appeared in Bangladesh since then. No
immediate word emerged on resuming publication.
   Monday's rioting in Chittagong occurred after curfew
restrictions were lifted for 15 hours, the longest relaxation since
the emergency was imposed.
   Curfew was also relaxed for 15 hours Monday in Dhaka. Opposition
workers organized street protests. Police did not try to break up
the gatherings.
   Witnesses reported brief clashes between demonstrators and
security forces in three areas of the city, but said no injuries
resulted.
   Shops opened and traffic returned to the streets. Government
offices and banks resumed business.
   Bangladesh, one of the poorest nations on Earth, has more than
90 million people. It is bordered by India, Burma and the Bay of
Bengal.

<HEAD>Pan Am Chief Ignored Internal Warning Memo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUMFRIES, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Pan Am security chief said
Monday he ignored a memo warning of ``a potentially dangerous
situation'' at London's Heathrow Airport nine months before the
terrorist bombing of Flight 103.
   The Dec. 21, 1988, bombing killed all 259 people on board the
Pan Am Boeing 747, which took off from Heathrow for New York.
Eleven people also died on the ground in Lockerbie, Scotland.
   An attorney cross-examining Daniel Soneson asked what his
response was to a memo from the airline's security chief in London
warning about what he considered failings in security measures.
   ``I didn't do anything,'' Soneson, Pan Am's former systems
director of corporate security, told the public inquiry into the
bombing.
   James Brwick, Pan Am's security manager at Heathrow at the time
of the bombing, has testified he sent a memo to his superiors at
Pan American World Airways in March 1988 expressing concerns that
the airline used X-rays to search baggage instead of the hand
searches required by the Federal Aviation Administration.
   Soneson, the systems director for 3{ years, said he thought the
memo was very subjective and was Berwick's opinion.
   ``I believed X-raying was an accepted practice and could detect
components of a bomb,'' he said. ``If you physically searched you
might not find them.''
   The attorney, Andrew Hardie, representing the British
government, asked Soneson: ``Would you agree that this memo was
alerting you to a potentially dangerous situation?''
   ``Yes,'' Soneson said.
   Hardie asked Soneson if he had considered changing the security
procedures at Frankfurt, Germany, which relied exclusively on
X-ray, in light of an FAA alert about a radiocassette recorder bomb
that would be difficult to detect by X-ray.
   ``No, because it would be most difficult through physical
inspection to find improvised devices,'' Soneson, 50, said.
   Flight 103 originated in Frankfurt with passengers and luggage
transferring to the jumbo jet in London.
   The inquiry has heard that the bronze Samsonite suitcase that
contained the radiocassette recorder bomb was probably loaded in
Frankfurt.
   Pan Am did not physically search luggage because the airline
believed it had been granted a dispensation by FAA director Ray
Salazar, Soneson said.
   But, he told the inquiry there was no written record of the
FAA's alleged dispensation, which he said was granted at a meeting
of the Air Transport Authority in Miami in October 1987.
   Under cross-examination, Soneson, who is now general manager of
the Fort Lauderdale, Fla., airport, acknowledged that no other
U.S.-based airline interpreted the FAA's decisions at the Miami
meeting in that way.
   He also testified that he did not know that Trans World Airlines
had applied for a dispensation from the hand search regulation in
October 1988 and had been refused.
   Baggage handlers at London's Heathrow Airport have testified
that bags from the connecting Pan American World Airlines flights,
including the Frankfurt flight, were not physically checked.
   The inquiry is expected to last into the new year.

   The 17th game of the World Chess
Championship between Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov has been
postponed from Monday to Wednesday at Kasparov's request.
   The two Soviet grandmasters still are scheduled to resume their
incomplete 16th game on Tuesday. That game was adjourned after five
hours Saturday and then again Sunday after nearly six more hours
without a result after 88 moves.
   Through the 15 completed games, they are tied with 7.5 points
each.
   They have had three draws in the French portion of the
championship. They had 10 draws in the 12 games played in New York
between Oct. 8 and Nov. 7.
   The first player to reach 12.5 points wins the championship, but
Kasparov would retain the title in the event of a draw.
   Each player is allowed to request up to three postponements
during the championship. The postponement requested by Kasparov on
Monday was his second, while Karpov has used one timeout.

   Pro-choice activists hailed a U.S. Supreme Court
decision Monday upholding a legal settlement that eased
restrictions on Illinois abortion clinics, but anti-abortion forces
vowed to pursue the case in lower court.
   The Supreme Court left intact a lawsuit settlement that rolled
back restrictions on abortion clinics. Without comment, the court
rejected an appeal that contended the settlement does not
adequately protect women or fetuses.
   ``I think we anticipated that they would not hear it. From a
practical standpoint, it was a good settlement,'' said clinic owner
Dr. Richard Ragsdale of Rockford, who sued the state to overturn
regulations he said were unnecessary for abortions before 18 weeks.
   The rejection is the latest setback to anti-abortion activists
who had hoped the court would use the Ragsdale lawsuit to further
tighten federal restrictions on abortion, legalized in 1973 by the
court's Roe vs. Wade decision.
   Craig Greenwood, an attorney who represented the two nurses who
filed the appeal, said they had also filed the appeal in the 7th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and would pursue that challenge.
   ``It was a remote shot, but this is an issue that has divided
the country for a number of years,'' Greenwood said. ``We wanted
the court to have an opportunity to show decisive leadership if it
chose to.''
   Ragsdale sued in 1985, challenging restrictions he said were
unnecessary medically and, in effect, forced abortion clinic
operators to build the equivalent of small hospitals or go out of
business.
   In 1985, a U.S. District Court suspended the regulations. The
court's suspension was upheld by the 7th Circuit appellate court in
1987, and state Attorney General Neil Hartigan appealed to the U.S.
Supreme Court.
   The justices last year agreed to hear the case. But as they were
about to hear arguments, the dispute was settled by an agreement
between Hartigan and the American Civil Liberties Union of
Illinois, which represented Ragsdale.
   U.S. District Judge John Nordberg in Chicago approved the
settlement in March. The settlement established separate rules for
two distinct kinds of abortion facility.
   For women under 18 weeks pregnant, abortions can be performed in
clinic settings. The state's original regulations requiring
full-service surgical facilities still apply in pregnancies of more
than 18 weeks.
   A coalition of anti-abortion groups opposed the settlement,
leading to the appeal acted on Monday by the high court.
   The appeal was filed by Ritaellen Murphy and Penny Greenwood,
two nurses who said the settlement does not adequately protect the
health of expectant mothers.
   ACLU attorney Colleen Connell, a member of the team that
hammered out the 1989 agreement, said oral arguments were scheduled
for Tuesday in the nurses' appeal to the 7th Circuit appellate
court.
   ``We were not surprised that the court rejected this attempt to
bypass the court of appeals, and their petition was totally without
merit,'' Connell said.
   Joseph Scheidler, executive director of the Pro-Life Action
League, said his organization would try to persuade legislators to
introduce new abortion restrictions when the state General Assembly
convenes next year.

<HEAD>Russian Federation Votes to Allow Farmers to Own Land</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers in the Russian republic may own land for
the first time in more than 60 years but must wait a decade to sell
it under a measure passed Monday by the Russian parliament.
   ``Farmers will be free now. They will be free in choosing the
ways and methods of their work and property,'' Russian President
Boris N. Yeltsin told a news conference after what he called an
``historic vote.''
   Yeltsin said farmers told him that allowing private ownership
would boost production ``in a year or two.''
   This winter, however, the Soviet Union must rely in part on food
purchased or donated abroad.
   After four days of acrimonious debate, a hush fell over the
Russian Congress of Peoples' Deputies as lawmakers voted 863-90,
with 40 abstentions, to reverse a land policy in effect since
dictator Josef Stalin carried out a bloody collectivization of land
between 1929 and 1932. Millions died in the resulting famine, and
Soviet agriculture took decades to regain earlier production
levels.
   Legislators cheered when the bill passed, and Yeltsin said later
that ``euphoria is natural when people have waited so long.''
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has recommended a
nationwide referendum on reversing collectivization. But Yeltsin
said the solid majority in the Russian parliament showed wide
backing for the move.
   Many opponents of the measure doubt whether farmers would buy
land. They say that even before collectivization, many small
landholders in the Russian republic worked under a communal system
of land ownership. Private land ownership by small landholders was
more common in other republics.
   The national legislature has yet to approve the sale of
farmland. It was not clear whether passage of the measure by the
parliament of the Russian Federation - by far the largest of the 15
Soviet republics - would force the Kremlin's hand or spark a
constitutional battle.
   The three Baltic Republics, which declared independence earlier
this year, have also passed laws allowing private land ownership,
although the process is bogged down in disputes over property
rights.
   The newly elected non-Communist parliament of Georgia is
expected to pass a law soon allowing private farmland.
   Yeltsin said the measure passed Monday ``will revive hundreds of
thousands of Russian villages'' that are being abandoned by farmers
who find it impossible to earn a decent living on state-owned land,
selling at state-set prices to a state distribution system.
   Although private holdings will be allowed, he said, ``collective
farm and other types of ownership will remain in existence ...
competing for their place in the market. All forms of ownership are
equal and protected by law.''
   Under the terms of the four-point resolution, the Russian
legislature will enact laws specifying how to break up collective
farms. Local legislative councils will have the final say on
whether to decollectivize.
   The resale of land would be blocked for 10 years, and then it
could be sold back only to the state.
   Parliament may decide to allow outright sale of land ``before
the 10 years are over ... if we see that these processes are going
smoothly,'' Yeltsin said.
   Russian farmers, he said, ``are set against buying or selling
land because they are afraid land will be an object of
speculation.''
   The original proposal would have allowed the resale of land
after five years.
   ``Russian peasants are not used to selling land, the land which
is called Mother,'' said Yeltsin. ``Some lawmakers have been saying
that, ``A Mother is not for sale.'''
   Yeltsin also stressed the need to monitor shipments of foreign
food into the Soviet Union over the next three or four months.
   ``In this mess ... the Mafia can make great use of this, and
sell it on the side,'' he said.
   Soviet crop yields were high this year, but much was lost due to
poor transportation and storage facilities.

<HEAD>Suspected Guerrilla Killed After Boat Forced Onto Beach</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fishing boat suspected of carrying guerrillas
was grounded Monday by Israeli forces, which shot and killed one
person aboard the vessel and arrested three others, the military
command said.
   The boat was spotted by an Israeli navy patrol craft off the
Gaza Strip and ordered to halt. It tried to head out to sea, but
the navy ship, assisted by air force helicopters, forced the boat
to land on a beach near the Deir el-Balah refugee camp, the army
said.
   Soldiers waiting on the beach killed one man when he tried to
escape, the army said.
   The army said it was checking alleged connections between the
suspects and recent guerrilla activity in the area.
   Meanwhile in the occupied West Bank, masked Palestinian
activists shot a suspected Israeli informant in the head and hanged
him from a telephone pole in a village square, Arab reports said.
   They said Saeed Abdul Rahman Jbur, 60, had been kidnapped
earlier from his home in Araba in the northern West Bank.
   A group calling itself The Black Panthers claimed responsibility
for the killing. The army said it was checking the report.
   Jbur's death raised to 311 the number of Palestinians killed by
Arabs on suspicion of assisting Israel during the nearly 3-year-old
uprising against Israeli occupation in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   At least 776 Arabs, including Monday's victim, have been killed
by Israeli soldiers or civilians in the revolt, and 53 Israelis
have died in the violence.
   The suspected collaborators included some prostitutes and drug
dealers, seen by activists as corrupting the morale of the revolt.
   Also Monday, a military court sentenced 12 Palestinian
guerrillas each to 30 years in prison for an aborted seaborne
attack six months ago aimed at the U.S. Embassy and Israeli
ivilians.
   The attempted raid on May 30 was claimed by the Palestine

   Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said Tuesday that
China's refusal to support a military threat against Iraq
disappointed U.S. officials, but won't derail Chinese efforts to
improve foreign relations.
   ``This visit to Washington was very successful and I'm very
satisfied with it,'' Qian said upon returning from the first
official Chinese visit to Washington since China's military
violently suppressed the pro-democracy movement in June 1989.
   Qian hedged when asked if he considered U.S.-China relations
normalized following his talks with President Bush and other U.S.
Officials.
   ``Both sides agreed to increase our contacts and exchanges so as
to increase our mutual understanding,'' Qian said.
   China gained considerable international goodwill by supporting
the first 11 U.N. Security Council resolutions aimed at forcing
Iraq to withdraw its troops from Kuwait. But China refused to
support the measure passed Thursday that clears the way for a
military strike against Iraq if its occupying army remains in
Kuwait after Jan. 15.
   The Security Council approved the resolution 12-2, with China
abstaining. China, as one of the five permanent Security Council
members, could have vetoed the measure.
   The United States lobbied intensely for the resolution, hoping
to marshal universal support to show Iraq the international
community opposes its occupation of Kuwait.
   Qian said the abstention would not hurt China's efforts to
improve foreign relations. China drew widespread condemnation after
its army opened fire on student-led demonstrators urging democratic
reforms. Hundreds of people were killed.
   ``China decides on its voting based on its own position and I
think all countries understand that,'' Qian said. ``The Americans
expressed a certain disappointment, but they also expressed a
certain understanding.''
   Qian also said he welcomed Bush's decision to send U.S.
Secretary of State James A. Baker III on a peace mission to
Baghdad.
   ``It has always been our position there should be some
dialogue,'' Qian said.
   Western countries and Japan have gradually lifted sanctions
imposed against China to protest the military crackdown.
   Western diplomats have acknowledged China's improved
international standing resulted in part from its cooperation during
the gulf crisis.
   Japan sent its education minister to Beijing in September and
resumed low-interest loans to China. The European Community voted
in October to lift all sanctions except the ban on arms sales and
defense cooperation.
   The United States had tried to downplay Qian's visit to
Washington, saying it didn't violate a U.S. sanction against
high-level exchanges.
   The U.S. State Department said the ban remains in place, but
applies only to ``exchanges of a formal and ceremonial nature.''
   Bush made an exception to the ban when he sent National Security
Adviser Brent Scowcroft to China in December 1989.

   Pictures taken by the Magellan spacecraft
suggest that volcanoes still spew Australia-sized lava floods on
Venus, and the planet didn't abruptly shut down after a
global-sized eruption 400 million years ago.
   ``Venus is not dead,'' Southern Methodist University scientist
Roger Phillips said Monday during the American Geophysical Union's
fall meeting.
   Magellan hasn't yet found direct proof that volcanoes are
erupting today on the planet, but ``it seems likely Venus is still
(volcanically) active today,'' said Steve Saunders, Magellan's
chief scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.
   The spacecraft's latest radar pictures of cloud-covered Venus
show there are absolutely no meteorite impact craters in an
Australia-sized portion of the planet's Sappho region, just north
of the Venusian equator, Phillips said.
   That means the huge area is covered by lava that was deposited
in a massive flood-like eruption sometime within the last tens of
millions of years - very young in geological terms, Phillips said.
   ``It raises the likelihood Venus is still active,'' the Dallas
researcher added.
   Venus ``has to be volcanically active, but demonstrating it is
going to be hard,'' said Brown University geologist Jim Head, a
member of the Magellan science team.
   To show conclusively that volcanoes now erupt on Venus, Magellan
must fly over the same parts of the planet twice and look for
differences caused by active lava flows. That won't happen until
next spring.
   Saunders said last month that most of the meteorite impact
craters on Venus appeared relatively young and fresh. He said that
suggested older impact craters were obliterated by gargantuan
floods of lava.
   At the time, Saunders said that either lava gushed from numerous
cracks in the surface to flood 60 percent of Venus during a single
catastrophe about 400 million years ago, or that a series of
somewhat smaller but still giant lava floods inundate various
regions of Venus during different times.
   The evidence Phillips presented Monday supports the second
theory.
   If a single global lava flood created most of Venus' lowland
plains 400 million years ago, meteorite impact craters should
appear across much of the planet's landscape. But the pictures
showing the uncratered region of Sappho suggest that huge, but not
global, lava floods occur on different parts of the planet at
different times, Phillips said.
   That, in turn, indicates massive volcanic flooding is an ongoing
process of Venus, the second planet from the sun.
   Magellan was launched from space shuttle Atlantis in May 1989,
went into orbit around Venus on Aug. 10 and formally started making
maps and pictures of the planet on Sept. 15.
   As of Monday, Magellan had orbited Venus 847 times, bouncing
radar off Magellan's surface to make maps and pictures during more
than 450 of the orbits, said Magellan experiment representative
Steve Wall.
   NASA engineers reported Monday that Magellan was unable to map
Venus during 3{ orbits of the planet Saturday and obtained only
poor-quality pictures during two other orbits.
   A device that locates stars to help point Magellan picked the
wrong star because of electronic static. That meant the
spacecraft's main antenna was unable to point properly and collect
radar echoes used to make pictures. Engineers fixed the problem
Saturday night by sending new computer commands to Magellan.

<HEAD>Newspaper: Jaruzelski Received Order for Martial Law on Train</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A spokesman for Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski on Monday
denied a newspaper report that quotes Jaruzelski as saying he was
secretly whisked to the Soviet Union in 1981 and ordered to crush
the Solidarity movement.
   ``Gen. Jaruzelski did not say this,'' said spokesman Wlodzimierz
Lozinski. ``There was no trip, no plane.''
   The former Communist leader, who will be replaced after Sunday's
presidential runoff, repeated in an interview with the Turin-based
daily La Stampa his contention he imposed martial law in order to
avoid a Soviet invasion.
   He was quoted in Sunday's editions of the paper as saying he set
out one evening for what he thought was a meeting in southwestern
Poland with the Soviet officer in charge of Warsaw Pact forces.
   But the Soviet plane instead took him to a Soviet military base
just across the border in Brest, the newspaper quotes him as
saying.
   From there, Jaruzelski was taken to an empty train in a nearby
station, La Stampa quotes him as saying. On entering, he found
then-Soviet KGB chief Yuri Andropov, and the chief Soviet
ideologist and Politburo member, Mikhail Suslov, waiting for him in
one car.
   ```Try to get out of this by yourself' was the gist of their
conversation,'' La Stampa quoted Jaruzelski as saying.
   ``We don't want to be forced to help you, but we certainly can't
allow a change of system in Poland,'' Jaruzelski quoted them as
saying. Shortly thereafter, in December 1981, Jaruzelski declared
martial law.
   Both Andropov and Suslov have since died, Andropov after a
short-lived tenure as Soviet leader.
   In Warsaw, Lozinski said the general ``had a lot of
conversations with Andropov and Suslov, but it was the author (from
La Stampa) who imagined that it happened in such circumstances.''
   ``The sentence used by Mr. Suslov is quite probable ... these
are obvious things, except for the description of a nighttime trip
to southwestern Poland,'' said Lozinski, who said he was present
with Jaruzelski during the interview with La Stampa.

<TEXT>
   The United States was ``grossly negligent'' in
rubber-stamping a Canadian report on a 1985 plane crash that killed
256 Americans and both governments failed to investigate the
possibility that terrorism was involved, according to a
congressional study.
   The National Transportation Safety Board should not have
uncritically accepted Canada's finding that ice on the wings caused
the crash in Gander, Newfoundland, says the staff report prepared
for the House Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on crime.
   ``We found no evidence that there was an investigation of
possible terrorism'' by the Canadians or the Americans, said the
report, which was obtained by The Associated Press on Monday.
Subcommittee members have not yet adopted the report.
   It will provide the basis for a hearing Tuesday into the Dec.
12, 1985 crash which occurred less than 30 seconds after liftoff
from the airport at Gander, Newfoundland.
   U.S. Rep. Robin Tallon, D-S.C., says the crash could be
connected to the Iran-Contra scandal. He suggests the plane may
have been the target of a terrorist attack as a reprisal stemming
from Iran's unhappiness with a weapons shipment authorized by the
Reagan administration.
   Shortly after the plane went down in Gander, an anonymous caller
said that Islamic Jihad, a pro-Iranian terrorist group, had put a
bomb on the plane.
   ``No one in the United States Government had detailed
information on what was done by the Canadians, or by the United
States government itself, to determine that terrorism was not the
cause,'' said the congressional report.
   It appears that FBI agents sent to Gander the day of the crash
``waited in a ... motel for whatever reports or conclusions
Canadian authorities saw fit to share with them,'' said the report,
which has not yet been voted on by the subcommittee members.
   ``After a mere 36 hours, they accepted a declaration that
`terrorism was not involved' and returned home,'' apparently
without getting any evidence to bolster that conclusion, it added.
   Spokesmen for both the NTSB and FBI declined comment. Both
agencies will send representatives to testify at the hearing.
   The chartered military flight operated by Miami-based Arrow Air
carried soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division coming home from
peacekeeping duties in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula.
   Less than three weeks before the crash, CIA proprietary aircraft
flew 18 Hawk missiles from Tel Aviv to Iran as part of the Reagan
administration's secret attempt to free U.S. hostages held in
Lebanon.
   The delivery of Hawks wasn't acceptable to the Iranians, who
wanted a more powerful version of the Hawk and felt they had been
duped.
   White House aide Oliver North used the Iranians' unhappiness to
urge further shipments.
   ``We stand a good chance'' of condemning U.S. hostages held in
Lebanon to death as well as a ``renewed wave of Islamic Jihad
terrorism'' if the Iran initiative is discontinued, North said in a
Dec. 4, 1985 computer message to his boss, national security
adviser John Poindexter.

   James Izzo's eyes had closed and he was
drifting into sleep as Northwest Flight 1482 taxied toward the
runway at Detroit Metropolitan Airport. Izzo, a nuclear engineer,
was on his way home to Pittsburgh.
   The next thing he knew, ``I heard a bang, felt a thud, and then
all of a sudden, there was a blast.''
   Flight 1482 - a Northwest Airlines DC-9 - had been hit by the
wing of another jet and was on fire. Izzo jumped from a window,
over the left wing and onto the runway, slippery with slush.
   ``I just watched the fire spread across the plane and engulf the
entire fuselage,'' he said.
   Izzo was among the lucky ones Monday, one of those who escaped
unhurt from the inferno that engulfed Flight 1482. Within an hour
of his escape, a charred hulk was all that remained of the jet, its
ceiling open to the sky.
   It was not immediately clear how or why it happened, or how many
people had died. This much appeared certain: Another Northwest jet,
a Boeing 727 departing for Memphis, clipped the DC-9 on the
taxiway, setting it on fire. The wing of the 727 was badly damaged,
but the rest of the plane was intact and its 146 passengers were
able to escape without serious injury.
   Passengers on the Memphis-bound plane, Flight 299, said the
collision felt like a heavy, dull thud.
   ``I thought the tire had blown out,'' said Robert Karp, 60, of
Jackson, Miss. ``The front end of the plane had begun to lift off.
I don't think the back wheels were off the ground yet.''
   Karp, a professor at Jackson State University who was sitting on
the plane's left side, said people on the other side of the plane
yelled: ``Oh my God, our entire wing is gone.''
   As passengers left through the rear of the plane, they saw the
wreckage of the DC-9 just 300 feet away.
   ``That's when it really hit me, when I saw the other plane at
the end of the runway. I thought `My God, how close were we to a
broadside collision?''' Karp said.
   Another Flight 299 passenger, Madana Mohan Kunjapur, 29, of
Florence, Ala., said ``we were just about to take off from the
ground when we hit the other plane, just like a heavy car tire
hitting. We knew either something had hit the wings or one of our
tires blew.''
   ``I saw a blur and heard a thump,'' said Edward Duda, 55, of
Plymouth, Mich., a materials engineer with Ford Motor Co. ``I saw a
lot of fuel pouring out of the plane. That's really what concerned
me. After I felt the impact, I thought it was a tire blow-out.''
   Passengers on Flight 299 ``generally were calm, but I was pretty
scared,'' Duda said.

   Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., said Monday
presidentially inclined members of Congress should be able to
pursue their ambitions without risking their political hides.
   Gejdenson said he was introducing a bill to let House members
and senators run for president and still appear on the ballot in
their home state for their legislative jobs.
   The bill adopt nationally the essence of a Texas law designed
for Lyndon Johnson and used by Lloyd Bentsen in 1988 to ensure he
could run for vice president without giving up his Senate seat.
   Texas is the only state with such a law, Gejdenson said.
   ``It shouldn't just be Texans who have the opportunity to run
for re-election and president simultaneously,'' Gejdenson said.
``And hhe country shouldn't be put in the position where a person
of that experience should either remove himself from office or stay
as majority leader or minority leader or committee chairman.''
   Republicans viewed the legislation as a thinly veiled bid to
widen the field of possible challengers against President Bush in
1992.
   ``It's nonsense,'' said Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., a close friend
of the president. ``If the states want to do it, let them do it.
... If legislators are not serious enough about the presidency to
be willing to give up a Senate seat or a House seat, then they're
not serious about being president.''
   Gejdenson said there is a crisis in a political system when
seasoned elected officials stay out of the presidential fray
because the odds are so long compared to the security of a powerful
post on Capitol Hill.
   Political science Professor Larry Sabato of the University of
Virginia said the GOP ``would be crazy'' to go along with
Gejdenson's proposal.
   ``They'd just be encouraging opposition to George Bush,'' Sabato
said.
   The Texas law allowing a candidate to appear on the state ballot
for two different offices was tailor-made in 1959 for Sen. Lyndon
B. Johnson, the Texas Democrat who ran for president the next year.
He lost the nomination to Sen. John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts,
but was on the successful national ticket as Kennedy's running
mate.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Tex., used the law to his advantage in
1988 when he ran for re-election while joining Gov. Michael S.
Dukakis in the presidential race.
   The move backfired for Dukakis, though. Instead of helping
Dukakis carry Texas, many voters in the Lone Star State supported
Bentsen for Senate and then voted for Bush for president.
   ``It was `Vote twice for Texas!''' Sabato said, ``so it actually
ended up hurting the Democrats.'' Bush, of course, claims Texas as
his home state.
   The LBJ law also cost Texas Democrats in 1960. For while Johnson
became vice president, Republicans won his Senate seat and have
held it ever since.
   Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif, incoming chairman of the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, said that while he thinks the
plan has merit, voters would have ``very little sympathy'' for it.
``Their current mood is for us not to run at all,'' Fazio said.

   At least four moderate earthquakes rattled
parts of the world, but there was nary a tremor Monday along the
New Madrid Fault, where a scientist said a earthquake was likely to
occur.
   ``This is just a normal day,'' said Waverly Person, chief of the
U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Center.
``We're not backing the prediction at all.''
   Along the New Madrid Fault, some schools were canceled and
residents purchased earthquake emergency kits and others left town,
just in case climatologist Iben Browning was right.
   Browning said there was a 50-50 chance for a major earthquake
early this week along the fault, which stretches from Marked Tree,
Ark., northeast through New Marid, Mo., to Cairo, Ill. He believes
tidal forces can trigger earthquakes, a theory most scientists
reject.
   ``There's just no way to predict an earthquake precisely,'' said
Person, who has been with the U.S. Geological Survey for more than
25 years. ``There are no two earthquakes alike.''
   The center received more than 50 calls about the New Madrid
forecast Monday morning and hundreds last week, said Person, who
began doing interviews for radio and television stations just after
midnight.
   As Person talked, 24 seismographs etched out activity recorded
by monitoring equipment in different parts of the United States,
ranging from Alaska to Tennessee.
   A needle jumped a few inches across the seismograph connected to
monitoring equipment in Tonopah, Nev. Person scanned the chart and
called to a colleague, ``It may be a nuclear test. That's where
they conduct those tests.''
   A few minutes later, the needle jumped again. ``That's not a
test,'' he said. ``That's a quake.''
   With a measured eye, he estimated the quake was magnitude 2.5 to
3.0 on the Richter scale. Quick calculations showed the quake was
magnitude 3.5, centered about 30 miles southwest of Ely, Nev.
   Between midnight and evening, four moderate quakes were recorded
at Golden. Three were in the South Pacific, a 5.9-magnitude shaker
near New Caledonia, and quakes of 5.1 and 5.0 in the area of Tonga.
The fourth was a 5.9-magnitude temblor in northern Colombia.
   A quake of that size can cause considerable damage in a
populated area, but aren't considered serious in remote spots.
About 800 quakes between magnitudes 5.0 and 5.9 are recorded each
year, said USGS spokesman Don Finley in Washington.
   The Richter scale gauges the amount of energy released by an
earthquake. A quake of magnitude 2 is about the smallest felt by
humans.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage. The big San Francisco Bay area quake last year
registered 7.1 on the Richter scale.
   In 1989, the earthquake center recorded 14,604 earthquakes, with
a magnitude 1 or higher, Person said. An average of 30 a day are
recorded.
   This fall, there have been two in the New Madrid Fault area,
magnitude 4.6 on Sept. 26 and magnitude 3.5 on Nov. 9, which ``is
not unusual,'' he said.
   Although earthquakes can be tracked historically, forecasting
them is difficult, if not impossible, Person said.
   Some people watch precursor activity, but that doesn't always
lead to an earthquake. Other quakes occur in a swarm over a period
of time, he said.
   Over the years, he has heard countless earthquake predictions.
One woman called daily, alerting Person that an earthquake was
about to occur, based on the number of birds that crossed her
windshield as she drove down the street.
   The job, he confesses, ``is never boring.''

   Hundreds of farmers held a rally in the

   The farmers said the amusement park, which newspapers have
labeled ``India's Disneyland,'' will render hundreds of acres of
fertile land useless for agriculture, Press Trust of India

   The government of Haryana state, which is adjacent to New Delhi,
announced earlier this year that land around 38 villages will be

<HEAD>Politically Polarized Berlin May Get Left-Right Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK FRITZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Berlin, a city that once symbolized a divided
world, is so united these days that two bitterly opposed political
parties are talking about running the city together.
   The conservative Christian Democrats defeated the left-leaning
Social Democrats in Sunday's city council race, just as they won
the national German elections held the same day.
   However, Christian Democrat leader Eberhard Diepgen, a former
West Berlin mayor and the united city's new mayor-elect,
immediately asked the Social Democrats to think about joining his
government.
   Both parties said Monday they would begin talks on putting
together a broad, left-to-right coalition for a city that is
without a doubt the most politically polarized municipality in
Germany.
   ``What Berlin now needs is responsible government,'' said Klaus
Landowsky, general secretary of the Berlin Christian Democrats.
   He called a merger with the Social Democrats ``mathematically
thinkable.''
   Politically unthinkable, however, is forming a coalition with
the third-largest party - the former Communists who used to run
East Germany.
   The Christian Democrats won 40.3 percent of the vote, the Social
Democrats 30.5 percent and the former Communists, now called the
Party for Democratic Socialism, finished with 9.2 percent.
   Traditionally, if no party captures a majority, the first place
finisher would try to form a coalition with the third-place party.
   Because of the stigma of East Germany's Communist past, however,
no mainstream German party wants to form an alliance with the
former Communists at any level of government.
   Sunday's election was the first time in 44 years that eastern
and western Berliners - once divided physically, ideologically and
psychologically by the Berlin Wall - could vote for the same
government.
   Diepgen, a West Berliner, will be the mayor and have to put
together a cabinet. He will answer to a 240-member legislature.
   He will inherit a troubled city. Western Berlin is a modern,
attractive metropolis faced with a housing crunch, a violent
radical leftist fringe and serious overcrowding.
   West Berlin always has been a state of perpetual bailout. It
spent much more than it took in annually because of huge subsidies
from the former West German government, which sought to keep afloat
an island of democracy in a sea of Stalinism.
   With Germany likely to face a cash crunch next year as the cost
of unification, some lawmakers may question whether Berlin should
continue to get a disproportionate share of federal money.
   Eastern Berlin, despite being the showplace of the former
Communist nation, is beset with environmental problems, rising
unemployment, bad roads and worse housing. It is also a stronghold
of the former Communists.

<TEXT>
   Tavern owners opened their doors early,
the governor paid a reassuring visit and reporters lurked at every
corner Monday, drawn by an earthquake forecast.
   The prediction was dismissed by mainstream scientists, but it
certainly put this Missippi River town of 3,200 in the spotlight.
   ``It's a zoo out there all right,'' said Eugenia Halterman, head
teller at the Bank of New Madrid on Main Street. She said the
goings-on were making the usually hectic first Monday of the month
even more frazzling.
   Rose Townsend, the town's postmaster, agreed.
   She was handling a stack of postcards and envelopes that came in
with requests for a ``Dec. 3, New Madrid'' postmark when Marilyn
Rhodes, of Ruston, La., stopped in seeking a postmark for her
husband, a stamp collector.
   ``This will be a surprise, an early Christmas present,'' she
said.
   The quake commotion was caused by Iben Browning, a
climatologist, who said the chances were 50-50 that a major quake
would hit the New Madrid Fault zone in the 48 hours before or after
Dec. 3. The fault runs from Marked Tree, Ark., to Cairo, Ill.
   Browning based his projection on tidal forces, which on Sunday
were at their highest level in 60 years. He also mentioned several
other locations including Tokyo and the Middle East for possible
quakes.
   Browning, who lives in Tijeras, N.M., was on vacation and
unavailable for comment, said his daughter, Evelyn Browning
Garriss.
   Earthquake experts and local seismologists have called
Browning's theory unscientific and said his projection is
worthless, but that didn't stop some schools from canceling classes
and the sale of earthquake kits.
   Missouri Gov. John Ashcroft toured New Madrid and several other
small towns Monday to make sure everyone knew that there was no
cause for alarm. New Madrid was the site of what are considered to
be two of the nation's strongest quakes, in 1811 and 1812. The last
major earthquake on the fault occurred in 1895.
   ``Panic is inconsistent with the appropriate response to living
in an earthquake-prone area,'' Ashcroft said during a visit to the
home of an elementary school principal, whose school was closed.
   At least four counties in southeast Missouri closed their
courthouses just in case Browning was right. Some schools that
stayed open reported higher than usual absences - 34 percent in one
southern Indiana district.
   In Franklin, Tenn., 30 miles west of Nashville, teachers let
young students bring teddy bears and favorite toys to school for
extra comfort.
   In St. Louis and Memphis, Tenn., the two largest cities closest
to the fault zone, the projection didn't have much of an impact on
the usual back-to-work rush.
   ``It's just been another regular day,'' said Memphis police
Capt. Chuck Ewerling.
   Radio commercials urged St. Louisians to buy a device called
``Quake Awake,'' which is a sort of earthquake alarm clock that
will sound when the ground moves. The cost was $39.95 and next-day
delivery was available.
   In New Madrid, at Hap's Bar and Grill, owner Jack Hailey had his
hands full serving the media and his regular customers who came in
after shifts at nearby aluminum and power plants.
   He had opened his ``Shake, Rattle and Roll'' party at 6 a.m. to
accommodate a radio station from St. Louis that was broadcasting
live from his tavern.
   But some local business owners said all the hoopla about
earthquakes would be bad for the already depressed local economy
and other residents weren't too happy with the portraits being
painted by journalists.
   ``I think we're being portrayed as a little backwards,'' said
Sandra Dial, a postal worker who was tired of seeing farmers in
overalls and folks sitting on bar stools as spokespeople for her
town.
   Police Chief Jim Helms said things were going smoothly.
   ``So far we haven't had a bit of trouble,'' he said. ``I kind of
figured we'd have some small problems, not with the news media, but
with some of the clowns around town.''
   A few people missed out on the excitement.
   Jennine Steward, an insurance office worker, was busy weeks ago
with a deluge of phone calls from clients checking on earthquake
insurance.
   ``Today has been real quiet. We've had no phone calls. It's just
been very quiet,'' she said.

<HEAD>Residents of Guatemalan Massacre Village Ask for Military Base</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GUATEMALA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents of the lakeside village of
Santiago Atitlan, where soldiers killed 12 people and wounded 21
last weekend, on Monday asked President Vinicio Cerezo to relocate
the military base in nearby Panabaj.
   Ramiro de Leon Carpio, Guatemala's attorney general for human
rights, promised a full probe of Sunday's incident and said he
received a petition from the village with more than 15,000
signatures saying the village had constant problems with the
military.
   ``There are various versions both from the authorities in the
area and the residents, but what is sure is that there are innocent
victims, and this must be cleared up with the search for the truth
about what really happened and putting those responsible in
court,'' he said.
   Santiago Atitlan, whose population is nearly 100 percent
indigenous, is in an area of Guatemala where the country's
30-year-old guerrilla movement has long been active.
   According to one version, the shooting started after men in
civilian clothes identified as army troops tried to take a resident
from his house without a warrant.
   Another version blamed it on disorderly troops who were drunk
and firing their weapons.
   There is agreement that villagers, led by town officials, were
headed toward the military base when the shooting began in the
early hours of Sunday.
   The morning newspaper El Grafico quoted one of the injured,
Estaban Diaman Coo, as saying ``it was the army that opened fire at
the people led by their mayor.''
   Another resident, Nicolas Raxtun Sapuli, said: ``First the mayor
tried to talk with the soldiers, but unfortunately a rain of
bullets came and we heard someone yell to get on the ground.''
   Antonio Rianda Coche said he hit the ground wounded, and two
dead people fell on top of him before emergency workers took him to
the hospital.
   The soldiers in the military zone were replaced Sunday night.
   The army issued a bulletin Sunday confirming the deaths and
offered to investigate.
   More than 100,000 Guatemalans have died the past 30 years
because of the civil war. The army, which has used ruthless tactics
in the mountainous, heavily indigenous areas of the southwest where
Sunday's killings took place, is frequently criticized for rights
abuses.

   Former President Reagan and his wife Nancy arrived
at London's Heathrow airport Monday night for a five-day visit to
Britain that will include a meeting with Margaret Thatcher.
   Reagan is scheduled to have lunch on Thursday with Queen
Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace and meet with Mrs. Thatcher, the
former prime minister, later the same day.
   Mrs. Thatcher on Nov. 22 announced her decision to resign as
prime minister after Conservative Party elders told her she could
not win a party leadership contest and formally quit on Nov. 28.
   Mrs. Thatcher, 65, who came to power in 1979, and 79-year-old
Reagan, who was president from 1981-88, were close political allies
when in power.
   Reagan did not speak to reporters at Heathrow. He and his wife
were driven away by car, flanked by U.S. security officers and
British police.

   More than 2,000 people were murdered in New York
during the first 11 months of 1990, making the year the city's
bloodiest ever, according to unofficial police statistics released
Monday.
   New York City rang out 1989 with 1,905 murders, also a record
high.
   The city's 1990 homicide rate continued to increase, as six
people were murdered during the period from Sunday night to Monday
morning, police said.
   The year's record murder rate was partially attributed to the
proliferation of handguns on the city's streets, as well as a
rising tendency toward violence, said Deputy Inspector Thomas V.
Connolly of the department's Office of Management Analysis &amp;
Planning, which tracks crime statistics.
   Of the 1,461 people murdered in the city during the first eight
months of the year, 65 percent were killed by guns, according to
the department's official figures, which lag as much as four months
behind the unofficial figures.
   The homicide figures are subject to change because some deaths
originally listed as murder could be reclassified later. Officials
expect the number of killings to surpass 2,000, because December
traditionally has a high number of murders.
   ``We've never seen as many guns as we've had this year, we've
never confiscated as many, never had as many arrests for weapons,''
Connolly said. He said 9,410 guns were taken off the streets
through the first six months of this year.
   The motives of many of the killings were not known, but Connolly
said many of the murders began as disputes or robberies and
escalated because a weapon was used.
   Seventy-three percent of the homicide victims were known to the
people who killed them, Connolly said.
   Most of the murders - 57 percent - occurred on the street.
Almost a quarter - 24 percent - happened during the commission of
another crime, most often robbery.
   The exact date isn't known, but the city's homicide rate passed
the 2,000 mark sometime during the last two weeks of November, said
department spokesman Sgt. Peter Sweeney.

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 250 noisy supporters of Lech Walesa
disrupted a presidential campaign rally for dark-horse challenger
Stanislaw Tyminski on Monday with shouts of ``KGB!'' ``Get Out of
Warsaw!'' and ``Go To Peru!''
   They threw a tomato and handful of change, some of which struck
the wealthy businessman without hurting him.
   Tyminski, who returned to Poland in September after 21 years in
Peru and Canada and decided to run for president, drew cheers from
his 1,000 adherents in the hall by defying the hecklers and
pledging to stay.
   ``I represent the hopes of millions of people,'' he said.
   Tyminski came from obscurity to place second Nov. 25 in the
first round of Poland's first popular presidential elections. He
faces Walesa in the runoff Sunday. Latest surveys have him trailing
the Solidarity leader by a 2-1 margin.
   Hecklers on Monday homed in on accusations that Tyminski is a
stalking horse for the former Communist system with chants like
``Ubek!'' - slang for secret policeman. He denied any connection
with the party.
   Walesa did not campaign Monday but used his allotted television
time to publicize Tyminski's connections to former party members.

<TEXT>
   At least 3,000 people are homeless following a
weekend earthquake in the Central Asian republic of Kirgizia, Tass
reported Monday. No one was killed, the official Soviet news agency
said.
   Saturday's quake registered 6.5 on the Soviet 12-point scale,
Tass said. It did not give a Richter scale reading and the Soviet
scale does not convert to the Richter scale.
   Tass said the quake was centered 12 miles east of Uzgen in the
Osh region where ethnic fighting has claimed more than 210 lives.
   It said 940 homes and public buildings were destroyed in Kyzyl
Charba, Salam Alik and Ak Terek villages.
   A state of emergency declared after ethnic violence flared in
Osh in June was lifted only last month. Ethnic Kirghiz and Uzbeks,
both mostly Sunni Moslems who speak Turkish dialects, are engaged
in a dispute over the allocation of land.

<TEXT>
   The Washington-Moscow hot line, a Cold War
tool set up in the 1960s to prevent an accidental war, will more
likely be used in the 1990s for disarmament talks, the Army said
Monday.
   Contrary to popular belief, the hot line is not a pair of red
phones, one in the Oval Office, the other in the Kremlin. It's a
complex web of technology enabling the heads of state in both
countries to exchange written messages directly, by teletype and
fax.
   ``I suspect the future of this facility will be focused more on
the remaining nuclear force reduction efforts, verification and
other issues that I suspect only our imaginations can address,''
said Lt. Gen. Jerome B. Hilmes, director of information systems for
the Secretary of the Army.
   The hotline is maintained at Fort Detrick, about 50 miles
northwest of Washington.
   Hilmes was at the base to announce completion of a $4.7 million
renovation of the emergency communications link. The improvements
included new transmitters and receivers, control consoles and a new
pair of 60-foot satellite dishes.
   The hot line was established in 1963, 11 months after tensions
rose between the United States and the Soviet Union during the
Cuban missile crisis. In that verbal altercation, President Kennedy
forced the Soviets to dismantle their missile bases in Cuba.
   The hot line has been used more than 15 times since then.
   One of the most notable uses was during the six-day Arab-Israeli
war in 1967. President Johnson advised the Soviet Union of U.S.
ship and aircraft movements in the Mediterranean Sea after an
Israeli attack on the USS Liberty.
   Though seldom used for its intended purpose, the line is tested
several times a day by technicians at both ends to ensure it works.
   As the cold war ebbs, routine, maintenance-related dispatches on
the presidential hot line are becoming more informal, said Tom
Brothers, manager of the Fort Detrick earth station.
   American technicians and linguists have detected a freer flow of
words in messages they exchange hourly with their Soviet
counterparts.
   ``Could we ask an unofficial question about basketball?''
Brothers said the Soviets asked last February. ``Could you please
tell us how our Kurtinaitis performed against your snipers?'' - an
apparent translation of long-range basketball shooters.
   The Soviets were referring to Rimas Kurtinaitis, a 6-foot-5
basketball star from Lithuania. The NBA had invited Kurtinaitis to
challenge eight of the NBA's best long-distance shooters in a
3-point contest in Houston.
   ``We'd like to know how he feels in the NBA,'' the Soviets said,
according to Brothers.
   He said the U.S. hot line workers replied, ``Friends, in the
local newspaper it says that Kurtinaitis is feeling fine, but there
are no results from the competition. They'll probably be in
tomorrow's paper.''
   Such informality was unknown several years ago, Brothers said.
   The first hot line, a trans-Atlantic teletype cable, was prone
to interruptions. A Finnish farmer cut a hot-line cable with his
plow in 1963. In the 1970s, a manhole fire north of Baltimore
severed the cable's primary circuit. About the same time, American
telephone workers accidentally cut the cables to the hot line.
   Today, each hot line message goes to the Soviet Union three ways
- by land cable and two satellite systems. The duplication is
necessary to ensure messages get through during a crisis, Brothers
said.
   Any message Bush might send to Gorbachev is encoded and taken to
a terminal in Washington. The message is transmitted to Fort
Detrick, where the signal is enhanced and relayed to two Soviet
satellites.
   The Soviet satellites, 22,300 miles above the equator, beam the
message to antennae south of Moscow.

   Even if the Baltic republics refuse to sign a new
Union Treaty, they will remain part of the Soviet Union unless they
follow constitutional procedures for secession, a top Soviet
legislator said Monday.
   Rafik Nishanov, chairman of the Council of Nationalities, one of
two chambers in the Supreme Soviet legislature, issued the warning
to the Baltics as he formally submitted the treaty to lawmakers.
   Another challenge to the treaty came from Russian President
Boris Yeltsin, who said the giant republic would not sign until
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev recognizes the republic's right
to control its own economy.
   Gorbachev has been pushing hard for adoption of the treaty to
hold the 15 Soviet republics together.
   It would replace the 1922 document that formally created the
Soviet Union and would give the restive republics more economic and
political autonomy. But a strong central government in Moscow would
retain control over defense, foreign policy, taxation, monetary
policy, electric power and transportation.
   Nishanov's speech indicated that the Gorbachev government is
maintaining a hard line on the issue of secession.
   Gorbachev sat on the rostrum during the legislative session but
did not speak.
   As expected, the 542-member Supreme Soviet formally referred the
Union Treaty to its parent body, the 2,250-member Congress of
People's Deputies, which meets Dec. 17. If the congress approves
the document, it will go to the 15 republics for ratification.
   The Baltic rpublics of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia refused to
participate in drafting the document and have said they will not
sign it.
   ``If the Baltic republics don't accept such a treaty, in my
opinion, they will remain in the Soviet Union on the basis of the
documents with which they joined the union,'' Nishanov told the
legislature.
   He added that under the Soviet constitution, the Baltic
republics have a right to secede, but only if they first hold
referendums and then follow rules established by the national
legislature. Those procedures could entail a waiting period of five
years, repayment for Soviet investments and resettlement of
Russian-speaking people now living in the Baltics.
   Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia were occupied by the Soviet army
at the start of World War II and were annexed in 1945. The Kremlin
has refused to recognize their declarations of independence this
year, saying they violate the Soviet constitution.
   The Baltic republics contend that they were occupied by force
and that their annexation was invalid. The parliaments of all three
republics, meeting in joint session in Vilnius last week, demanded
the removal of Soviet ``occupation'' forces and international
recognition of their independence.
   In addition to the Baltic republics, Armenia, Georgia and the
Ukraine have said they will not sign the Union Treaty in its
current form. Georgia's parliament has declared that it wants full
independence, and there are also strong independence movements in
Armenia and the Ukraine.
   Without mentioning Yeltsin by name, Nishanov attacked Yeltsin's
proposal for bilateral treaties between republics.
   Forming ``a union without a center ... would be a step
backwards,'' he said.
   But Yeltsin said he would sign the treaty ``only ... when the
declaration of Russian sovereignty is recognized, when the budget
is separated, when property is divided, hard currency, gold, oil,
gas, and so forth'' are transferred from Soviet to Russian control.
   ``I will not compromise at the expense of Russia's
sovereignty,'' said Yeltsin, who has advocated greater Russian
control over its politics and economy since he was elected last
May.
   Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev, the Soviet Army chief of staff,
told the legislature that defense had to remain a function of the
central government.
   He noted that defense installations and academies were spread
across the country, and he said nuclear weapons should remain under
the control of only a few top officials.
   ``No other way (of handling nuclear weapons) is possible,''
Akhromeyev said. ``That's how it's done both here and in the United
States.''

   Tyminski took a deep interest in folk healing rituals while

Channel 4's news program En Persona said in a special report Sunday
night.
   Iquitos folk healer Francisco del Castillo said in a taped

several occasions.
   The program also detailed Tyminski's legal clashes over two of
his Iquitos businesses - PetroRapido, a gasoline distribution
network, and TVS-Iquitos, a cable TV channel.
   In April, the Supreme Court ruled Peruvian law was not violated
in the business ventures.
   Friends described Tyminski as energetic, a man always on the
lookout for business opportunities.
   ``Everything was a business to him,'' the Rev. Jose Maria, a
friend in Iquitos, said.
   Tyminski faces Solidarity leader Lech Walesa in a runoff for the

   President Bush shrugged off a military
revolt in Argentina and proclaimed ``a new era of hope'' in newly
democratic South America as he opened a five-nation tour Monday.
Bush vowed not to skip a visit to Buenos Aires and, indeed, the
uprising there collapsed by day's end.
   The administration had expressed confidence the rebellion would
be quelled quickly but also had left room for a late change in
Bush's plans.
   ``If the situation became such that there was a real danger to
his security, I'm sure we'd take another look at it,'' said Deputy
Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger.
   The Argentine crisis threw a cloud over Bush's week-long
mission, intended to celebrate the sweep of democracy throughout
the hemisphere. It also obscured Bush's message that Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait was driving up oil prices and forcing poor
countries to pay high fuel bills that they could ill afford.
   In Argentina, the government put down the last remnants of the
uprising, the fourth of its kind in less than four years, by
bombing rebel tanks. The government news agency said the last of
several hundred rebels had surrendered. Nine people were reported
killed.
   Francisco Rezek, foreign minister of Brazil, called the revolt
in Argentina ``a step backward for democracy in Latin America.''
   The Bush administration took another view.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater told reporters
Monday evening that the situation in Buenos Aires ``does appear to
be improving'' and that Argentine President Carlos Menem was in
control.
   ``It is not a large-scale uprising,'' Fitzwater said. ``My
argument would be that fundamentally democracy in Argentina is
working and when this is over it will demonstrate the roots of
democracy in Argentina are fairly deep.''
   Bush said he would not abandon a planned stop Wednesday in
Buenos Aires, where Menem declared a state of siege, suspending
constitutional guarantees, after the fourth military uprising in
four years.
   ``I have great confidence in the security there,'' Bush said.
   Administration officials accompanying Bush talked throughout the
day with U.S. Embassy officials in Buenos Aires.
   The rebellious soldiers said they were not trying to overthrow
the government but wanted to force changes in the way the military
is run.
   There also was violence in Chile, another stop on Bush's trip,
as bombs exploded in a chapel and in the offices of two right-wing
political parties. There were no injuries. An anonymous caller said
the blasts were a protest of Bush's visit.
   Bush arrived in Brasilia at dawn after an overnight flight from
Washington, accompanied by a mostly junior staff. He was greeted by
a 21-gun salute and military pageantry at the pillared Planalto
Palace, the workplace of President Fernando Collor de Mello.
   The day ended with announcement of approval by Bush to license
the sale of a high-performance computer sought by Brazil for more
than two years. The step was taken to reward Brazil for agreeing,
along with Argentina, to renounce any intention to proceed with
nuclear programs with a military dimension.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III remained in Washington to
testify before Congress on the Persian Gulf. White House chief of
staff John Sununu and national security adviser Brent Scowcroft
also stayed home.
   While celebrating the rebirth of democracy in South America,
Bush put a strong emphasis on the Persian Gulf crisis and Iraq's
takeover of Kuwait.
   Bush said Czechoslovakia, where he visited last month, is paying
$1.5 billion in additional fuel costs because of Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein's refusal to retreat.
   Collor, during a picture-taking session with Bush, said Brazil
is paying $5 billion more for oil.
   Bush responded, ``That's why, (when) people say to me, `Well,
this can go on and on and on,' I say, `No,''' Bush said.
   Bush raised the gulf crisis again during a speech to the
Brazilian Congress. ``I realize the sacrifices that Saddam's
brutality has caused this nation and its people, has caused many
nations around the world.''
   He mentioned the fuel estimates for Czechoslovakia and Brazil
and said it was the direct result of ``the brutality and the
aggression of Saddam Hussein.''
   The military trouble in Argentina put a cloud over Bush's
tribute to the sweep of democracy in the Western Hemisphere.
Administration officials played down the problem. One official
referred to it as ``an inter-military squabble.''
   Assistant Secretary of State Bernard Aronson said, ``There's a
small group in the military that has certain grievances and every
once in a while something like this happens.''
   Fitzwater said the incident apparently was intended to embarrass
Menem before Bush's visit.
   ``The president wants to express his confidence in President
Menem and his support for democracy in Argentina,'' Fitzwater said.
   In an interview with Cable News Network, Collor said Menem
called him and said the uprising was ``the responsibility of a
minority group and a very localized event with no practical
consequence for democracy in Argentina.''
   The past decade has seen a resurgence of democracy across Latin
America. Four of the five countries on Bush's itinerary - Brazil,
Uruguay, Argentina and Chile - emerged from military dictatorships
in the past decade. Venezuela turned to democracy in 1958.
   Bush's trip comes at a time of unusual harmony in U.S.-Latin
American relations, and there were no burning issues on the agenda.
An administration official said ``it's an old-fashioned question''
to be asking about possible U.S. aid for Latin America, which
suffered through soaring inflation and falling living standards
during the 1980s.
   Bush told the Brazilian Congress, ``All of us have been
galvanized by a new era of hope and opportunity throughout the
Americas, especially here in Brazil.''
   He hailed the ``extraordinary political and economic change that
is transforming the face of this hemisphere'' and described Brazil
as a leader in this effort.
   In particular, Bush cited Collor's efforts at reducing the size
of the state, privatizing enterprises, combating inflation and
liberalizing trade.
   These steps, he said, ``are the keys to growth and prosperity in
the global economy of the 21st century.''
   Collor put in place a Draconian austerity plan which froze most
bank accounts for 18 months and suspended automatic wage increases.
With inflation creeping back up and a string of industrial
bankruptcies, Collor's popularity has dropped sharply and his
reform plan is in danger.
   The centerpiece of Bush's policy toward Latin America is the
Enterprise for the Americas Initiative, which is designed to
achieve economic growth through expanded trade and investment and
reduced debt.
   Brazil's foreign debt is $112 billion, the largest in any
developing country. The country is almost $10 billion in arrears on
debt repayments and is negotiating a new repayment schedule with
creditors.
   ``Brazil intends to reach an agreement that it can honor,''
Collor said Monday night, speaking at a dinner for Bush. ``We seek
to reach a serious commitment with our creditors.''
   Collor also said his country is determined to protect the Amazon
environment and be ``the leader of a crusade to harmonize the ends
of economic development with the respect for the environment.''
   In his toast, Bush said: ``I believe we've just begun to tap the
true potentials of the Americas and it is within our power to bring
a new dawn to the new world. ... Together our opportunities are
boundless. And so let us forge a closer and more vital partnership
to esnure lasting prosperity for all our people.''

   Federal drug agents in the northern state of
Sinaloa shot to death six passersby during a failed raid on a
smuggling plane, officials said Monday.
   The incident took place in the pre-dawn hours Sunday, said
Angelica Gil, a spokeswoman for the federal attorney general's
office in Mexico City.
   She said the agents went to a remote airstrip, hoping to
intercept a shipment of cocaine. They arrived too late, she said,
and found the plane had been unloaded and abandoned.
   In the ``darkness and confusion,'' the agents opened fire on a
passing vehicle, killing four adults and two minors, she said.
   ``Unfortunately they weren't involved. They were innocent
Mexicans,'' Gil said.
   Assistant Attorney General Jorge Carrillo went to Sinaloa state
Monday to investigate the incident, she said.
   Gil said no further details were immediately available.
   The incident came to light through a telephone call to The
Associated Press from a ham radio operator in the United States.
   The caller said he had monitored what appeared to be
transmissions from U.S. agents tracking the drug plane from South
America up the west coast of Mexico.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Steve Telkins in Mexico City said no U.S.
government agents were involved in the shootout. He was not able to
confirm whether U.S. agents had tracked the smuggling plane.
   The United States has an intelligence team its embassy in Mexico
City that passes air surveillance information to Mexican
authorities.
   In a related development, 12 officers and 23 agents of the
Federal Judicial Police were dismissed Monday and charged with
abuse of authority and other crimes, the official news agency
Notimex reported.
   Notimex quoted Carrillo as saying five of the dismissed officers
and all the agents were serving in the northern state of Chihuahua.
The other seven officers were from Mexico City.
   The agency did not go into details concerning the accusations.
   The Federal Judicial Police, which is under the Attorney
General's Office, has widely been accused of abusing its authority
in its fight against drug trafficking.
   Dozens of complaints recently were filed in Chihuahua state and
in Mexico City against the organization.

   The military crushed a daylong
uprising Monday by hundreds of rebels demanding a shake-up in the
army high command. At least 13 people were killed.
   The right-wing insurrection occurred two days before President
Bush, in Brasilia on the first leg of a South American trip, was to
visit. U.S. officials who closely monitored the situation to the
south said Bush will arrive as scheduled Wednesday.
   The uprising was the fourth and bloodiest in less than four
years in Argentina, where democracy was restored in 1983 after
nearly eight years of harsh military rule.
   The rebellion collapsed Monday night after tanks surrounded army
headquarters, the one remaining rebel stronghold, and the last
mutineers surrendered. Warplanes earlier bombed two columns of
rebel tanks.
   ``The triumph of the armed forces was absolute,'' President
Carlos Menem told a news conference. ``The surrender was
unconditional.''
   About 420 rebels - soldiers and civilians - surrendered, army
officials said. Others were being sought. Rebel leader Col. Enrique
Baraldini was among those arrested.
   Monday's rebel leaders may face the death penalty. ``The
military code of justice contemplates that possibility,'' Menem
said. ``The full measure of law will be applied.''
   Before dawn, hundreds of mutineers and armed civilians took over
army headquarters in downtown Buenos Aires, two blocks from
Government House; the Palermo infantry base 5 miles to the north;
the Boulogne tank factory 16 miles northwest; and at least two
other installations.
   In contrast to three previous insurrections dating to April
1987, during Raul Alfonsin's presidency, Menem - in his 16th month
of power - refused to negotiate.
   ``This is an attempted coup d'etat and will be treated as
such,'' he said after declaring a state of siege.
   White House spoksman Marlin Fitzwater said in Brasilia, the
capital of Brazil, it seemed likely the incident was intended to
embarrass Menem before Bush's visit.
   ``It's also the reason we want to make clear our support for
democracy and President Menem,'' Fitzwater said.
   Firefights raged all day in and near this capital of 11 million
residents, capped just before nightfall by air force planes bombing
rebel tanks on public roads.
   At least seven soldiers, one rebel and five civilians died
before order was restored, the government news agency Telam
reported. The civilians were in a bus hit by a tank.
   Twenty people were injured in that crash, Telam reported. At
least 11 soldiers and one rebel were shot and wounded, the army
said, along with at least 10 civilians, local news agencies
reported.
   Menem said banks and foreign exchange houses would reopen
Tuesday following the bank holiday declared Monday by the Economy
Ministry.
   Jorge Newbery metropolitan airport was reopened Monday night.
The state of siege, suspending constitutional guarantees, will be
lifted by week's end, Menem said.
   The insurrection, broadcast live on television and radio,
disrupted Buenos Aires.
   Banks were ordered closed at 1:30 p.m. Federal employees sent
home two hours later. The stock exchange closed early. Federal
police barred public gatherings. Key roads were blocked off to
protect civilians and give priority to military traffic. Security
at Congress and Government House, where Menem has his office, was
reinforced.
   Bullets lodged in Government House and the Economy Ministry.
Vice President Eduardo Duhalde's helicopter was hit by gunfire as
it landed at Government House, but Duhalde was unhurt.
   The uprising began at about 3:30 a.m. when rebels, their faces
blackened commando-style, appeared at army headquarters and took
over several floors.
   About the same time, other rebels seized the Palermo infantry
base and Boulogne tank factory.
   They insisted they were not out to overthrow the government.
   ``This is not a coup,'' a spokesman told reporters. ``We
recognize the authority of President Menem as commander-in-chief.''
   Asked their motives, the unidentified lieutenant replied, ``The
same as during the Holy Week uprising: Our generals don't represent
the sentiment nor the thought of our army.''
   In April 1987 and January 1988, then Lt. Col. Aldo Rico led
barracks revolts to halt trials of officers accused of human rights
abuses during the 1976-83 dictatorship, force generals to retire
and the government to increase the military budget.
   There were no deaths reported in the first uprising, and two
loyalist soldiers were wounded when their truck ran over a mine in
January 1988.
   Rico was imprisoned and cashiered, but most trials were halted
after those uprisings, military pay was increased and a number of
generals retired.
   Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin's insurrection in December 1988 had
similar motives and results. One civilian was killed and several
wounded when fired on during a demonstration outside the occupied
arsenal.

   Iraq said Monday that the Palestinian
people must have a homeland in the West Bank and Gaza before any
other Mideast peace questions can be dealt with.
   ``The first question is Palestine,'' Iraqi delegate Adnan Malik
told the General Assembly. ``Palestine comes first, Palestine comes
second and Palestine comes third.''
   The United States has refused to link the Palestine issue to
Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait. President Saddam Hussein of Iraq has
said the Palestinian problem must be on the agenda in any dialogue
with Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   A General Assembly subcommittee meanwhile voted 132-1 to condemn
Iraq for purported human rights violations in Kuwait. Iraq voted
against the recommendation by the Third Committee, which deals with
social affairs. Zambia abstained.
   The committee sent a draft resolution to the General Assembly
denouncing ``the continued and increasing acts of torture, arrests,
summary executions, disappearances and abduction'' in Kuwait by
Iraqi forces.
   It criticized Baghdad's refusal to let the Red Cross into Kuwait
and expressed ``grave concern'' over deteriorating living
conditions under Iraqi occupation.
   In a letter to the Security Council, Ambassador Mohammad
Abulhasan of Kuwait charged Iraq with ruining his homeland's
agriculture since seizing the emirate on Aug. 2.
   With food shortages setting in, said Abulhasan, ``Kuwaitis who
refuse to acquire Iraqi identity documents are unable to obtain
food or fuel.''
   He accused Iraq of looting Kuwait of at least 2,000 Arabian
horses, 20,000 cattle and all the zoo animals, and of converting
parks into military camps.
   The Security Council's committee on sanctions decided Monday to
allow a food shipment to Soviets trapped in Iraq, but deferred
action on a similar request for Palestinians in Kuwait.
   A diplomat who attended the private meeting said the committee
approved a ``one shot'' delivery of food for Soviets outside
Baghdad, whose diet is limited by rationing and available food
supplies.
   The Soviet Red Cross will supervise distribution of food, the
diplomat said. About 3,500 Soviets are still in Iraq. The official,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Soviets did not
specify how many were in Baghdad, and how many were in rural areas.
   At U.S. insistence, the committee deferred until its next
meeting action on a similar request for food for Palestinians
living in Kuwait.
   The diplomat quoted Abulhasan as having said the Iraqis treat
Palestinians in Kuwait better than Kuwaitis.
   Malik said ``a radical solution to the question of Palestine,
which guarantees an end to Zionist occupation, which guarantees the
exercise by the Palestinian people of their inalienable rights,
foremost of which is its right to self-determination and the
establishment of its independent state with its capital Al-Quds
el-Sharif (Jerusalem) - this is the only way to solve the crisis in
the region.''
   Israel has occupied the West Bank and Gaza Strip and controlled
all of Jerusalem since the 1967 Middle East war. Most residents of
the occupied territories are Palestinians.
   Malik portrayed Iraq as the hero of the Palestines.
   ``The United States of America and Israel refuse recognition to
the Palestinian people, among all peoples of the world, the right
to self-determination,'' he said.
   ``We must unmask the great gap between their claim to defend
international legitimacy and the new international order, on the
one hand, and their silence, indeed their support, for the crimes
of the Zionist entity.''
   To curb Israel, Malik said, Iraq had created ``a preventive Arab
force ... capable of achieving a measure of balance to deter the
Zionist terrorists and put an end to their expansionist, aggressive
policies at the expense of Palestinian people and the Arab nation.
   ``That has made Iraq a major target in the Zionist-American
plots.''
   He said America's true objective in the gulf crisis is ``control
of the oil wealth in the region.''

<HEAD>Scientists Project Severe Earthquake in Los Angeles Basin</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The earthquake that rocked the Los Angeles
Basin and caused $12 million in damage in February may only be the
prelude to a nastier jolt to come, scientists said Monday.
   The Upland earthquake Feb. 28, which measured 5.2 on the Richter
scale, failed to relieve stress on the San Jose Fault, said Egill
Hauksson, a seismologist at the California Institute of Technology
in Pasadena.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy an earthquake
releases, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph.
   As a result of that unspent stress, the San Jose fault may
produce a quake measuring 6 to 6.5 on the Richter scale, Hauksson
said during the American Geophysical Union's fall meeting.
Scientists couldn't say when that might be, he said.
   The last quake of that size in the Los Angeles Basin was the
Feb. 9, 1971, San Fernando-Sylmar quake, which had a magnitude of
6.4. It killed 65 people and injured 2,000 more as it collapsed
freeway overpasses and caused $511 million in damage.
   The new study of the San Jose fault's potential for disaster was
conducted by Hauksson and his wife, U.S. Geological Survey
seismologist Lucy Jones.
   Roughly 11 miles long, the San Jose Fault starts near the base
of the San Gabriel Mountains north of Upland and runs southwest
near Claremont and Pomona.
   The Feb. 28 quake was centered 3 miles northwest of Upland, a
community 40 miles east of downtown Los Angeles. It shook much of
the Los Angeles Basin, causing minor injuries and $11.8 million in
damage.
   The quake ruptured the fault's northeastern 2{ miles.
   The other 8{-mile section hasn't broken in any recent
earthquake. Hauksson said he and Jones analyzed the type of
faulting caused by the aftershocks in a quake in 1988 and the one
in February.
   They concluded the two quakes failed to relieve stress on the
rest of the San Jose Fault, which by its length could produce a
jolt of 6 to 6.5 magnitude.
   ``There are still forces stored up in the region that could
produce another earthquake as large or larger than what we've
already had,'' Jones said.
   But far worse has been projected for Southern California - the
so-called ``big one'' on the San Andreas Fault that scientists say
will measure 7.5 to 8 or more in magnitude.
   A 1988 Geological Survey report said such an event quake is at
least 60 percent likely by the year 2018. An earlier federal report
said it could kill up to 14,000 people, hospitalize 55,000 and
cause $17 billion in damage.
   But scientists believe the region will be shaken more often by
smaller but still deadly quakes on other faults, including the San
Jacinto Fault, the Elysian Park Fault and the Newport-Inglewood
Fault.

<HEAD>Iran Gets United Nations to Water Down Human Rights Resolution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Iran persuaded the General Assembly on
Monday to delete all references to``executions, ill-treatment and
torture'' from a draft resolution on human rights violations in
Iran.
   To avoid a divisive vote, sponsors removed language Iran found
offensive.
   In return, Iran pledged to continue cooperating with U.N. human
rights investigations and to allow the Red Cross to visit its
prisons.
   A General Assembly subcommittee on Tuesday will recommend
adoption by consensus of the toned-down resolution.
   A vote on the original draft would have been a humiliating
public rebuke to Iran, which then would have barred future visits
by rights experts.
   Tehran radio, monitored in Cyprus, called the original draft a
``lever'' to pressure Iran into dropping its opposition to
multinational forces, posted in Saudi Arabia. The radio said Iran
upset major powers by refusing to join the mostly American forces
facing Iraq after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Last week Iran told Italy and Germany, two co-sponsors of the
original draft, their relations with Tehran would suffer if it
passed in that form.
   Diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Iran also
let it be known that lucrative economic deals were at stake.
   Soaring oil prices caused by the crisis have given Iran a
multibillion-dollar windfall.
   The draft to which Tehran objected was introduced Thursday in
the General Assembly's Third Committee, which deals with social and
humanitarian issues.
   Reynaldo Galindo Pohl of El Salvador prepared a study for the
United Nations that severely criticized the climate of fear he said
he found in Iran, and reported abuses of due process and a
startling number of executions.
   The language deleted at Iranian insistence would have had the
assembly express ``its concern about the numerous allegations of
violations of human rights contained in the report, which according
to the special representative have a credible basis, notably those
concerning executions, ill-treatment and torture.''
   It would have noted ``with concern the number of executions''
reported in Iran.
   The new draft expresses concern over ``allegations of violations
of human rights contained in these reports'' by Galindo Pohl.
   It asks Iran to ``investigate and rectify the human rights
issues raised by the special representative, in particular as
regards administration of justice and due process of law.''
   All the European Community and Nordic countries co-sponsored the
original draft, but Iran concentrated its efforts to amend it on
Italy, now EC chairman, and Germany, Europe's economic giant.
   All 159 General Assembly members are on the Third Committee, so
the committee's action foreshadows the approach the entire assembly
will take toward the resolution this month.
   Last week, 32 U.S. senators wrote to Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar demanding condemnation of Iran as a rights abuser.

<HEAD>A Caribbean `Caucasian Chalk Circle' Opens Off-Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs planned.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The exotic calypso-flavored world of a Papa
Doc-like Haiti is a far cry from a grim World II Soviet Union, but
``The Caucasian Chalk Circle'' survives the transplant with most of
its theatricality intact.
   Director George C. Wolfe has done an impressive job in moving
Bertolt Brecht's political parable into a magical, mystical
Caribbean wonderland where violence and a child-like innocence
exist side by side. This revival, which opened off-Broadway last
weekend at the New York Shakespeare Festival Public Theater,
reverberates with a sense of style and place that rarely betrays
the material.
   Wolfe uses song, dance, outlandish costumes, masks and puppets
to tell Brecht's story of a kitchen maid who rescues the child of a
deposed political leader and flees with the baby to safety. After
the revolution, the biological mother wants her son back, and the
case goes before a peasant-turned-judge for resolution.
   ``Chalk Circle'' has been transformed by Thulani Davis, who
skillfully adapted an English-language version of the play, moving
the locale from the Caucasus in 1945 to present-day Haiti.
   A long first act, which actually cuts Brecht's cumbersome
prologue, captures the work's fairy-tale quality. Several actors
are of enormous help in telling the story, particularly Novella
Nelson as the strong-voiced narrator and Charlayne Woodard as the
courageous maid who risks all for the baby. In her fight for the
child, Woodard displays a conviction that blends equal amounts of
charm and determination. Altogether beguiling.
   The show and the showmanship falter in a meandering Act 2 when
the parable shifts into political tract. The humor becomes
heavy-handed primarily because actor Reggie Montgomery, who plays
the judge, mugs his way through the role. Montgomery manages to
shrink what should be a star turn into a performance of sitcom
size.
   But it doesn't fatally damage the evening. There are still those
other distinctive performances to watch as well as the colorful
costumes by Toni-Leslie James, and the mask and puppet designs by
Barbara Pollitt and Stephen Kaplin.
   Wolfe has had other successes at the Public, including his own
funny, fractured revue of black life called ``The Colored Museum''
and ``Spunk,'' an adaptation of three short stories by Zora Neale
Hurston.
   With ``The Caucasian Chalk Circle,'' he's shown he can take a
masterpiece and turn it inside out and into something provocatively
different.

   A nationwide general strike that kept 500,000
workers from their jobs ended Monday after the government reached
an agreement with union leaders over tax hikes and the minimum
wage.
   The two-day strike was called by the Histadrut Labor Federation
after the Cabinet proposed cutting the minimum wage by 20 percent
to $417 a month, and adding a 20 percent tax on pension savings.
   According to Israel radio, pensions now will only be taxed on
those earning more than twice the average wage of $2,500 a month.
   Both sides left the issue over minimum wage unresolved. The
Treasury agreed to freeze legislation for six weeks while a joint
committee of Treasury and Histadrut officials seek an agreement,
the radio said.
   The Hisadrut, an umbrella organization, represents about 1.5
million workers. Those employed in private business were exempted
from striking, keeping most banks open and public buses running.

   Spoiled chicken is being blamed for a
case of mass food poisoning that may be responsible for the death
of one man, authorities said Monday.
   Most of those affected work at maquiladoras, border plants, in
the Mesa de Otay. According to the Mexican Institute of Social
Security, the first wave of people with food poisoning - about 30 -
arrived at Clinic No. 20 on Saturday.
   Among those first treated was assembly worker Rosario Garcia
Montoya, 26. Jaime Miranda y Soto, an institute spokesman, said
Garcia later died from what may have been food poisoning.
   ``We will conduct an autopsy to determine the exact cause of
death,'' he said.
   Baja California authorities said a food-catering business,
Cocinas Industriales, which feeds many of the maquiladora workers
in Mesa de Otay, may have served spoiled chicken.
   A spokesman at Samsung Mexicana, one of the assembly plants,
said several workers at the plant started experiencing stomach
aches and dizziness Saturday morning.
   Other plants in the area also began reporting similar cases,
said the spokesman, who identified himself as the plant's manager
but declined to give his name.
   Miranda y Soto said Cocinas Industriales has been shut down
while Baja California district attorney's officials conduct an
investigation.
   Victor Manuel Vazquez, assistant state attorney general, said
that as many as 140 people may have been affected.

landed in Leningrad, Tass reported Monday.
   The official Soviet news agency said Herman Gerasimov
commandeered a Tupolev 154 three-engine jet soon after it took off
Sunday.
   ``The crew received a note from a passenger demanding to be
taken to Stockholm, threatening to blow up the plane,'' Tass said.
   Tass said the passengers were released after talks with the
hijacker at Leningrad's Pulkovo Airport. He was then seized by an
assault squad. Grasimov was carrying a homemade bomb, Tass
reported.
   Seven Soviet airliners on domestic flights have been hijacked to
Finland or Sweden this year, Most of the hijackers have been
returned to the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>7 Indicted on Murder Charge in Halloween Rampage on Homeless</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven young men have been indicted on murder,
assault and riot charges in a Halloween night attack on homeless
men living in a makeshift camp.
   The indictments were announced Monday by Manhattan District
Attorney Robert Morgenthau.
   The defendants, some wearing masks depicting horror movie
characters, were allegedly among about 15 who crossed a footbridge
from Manhattan onto Ward's Island, in the East River, and invaded
the shantytown.
   They beat and robbed several homeless men, using tree limbs,
bats, pipes and a meat cleaver. One man died of his injuries; six
others required hospital treatment.
   Six of the suspects were rounded up between Nov. 2 and Nov. 5
and a seventh was arrested Nov. 8 during a robbery, Morgenthau
said.
   The defendants, each charged with murder, assault and riot,
include five adults, ages 17 to 23, and two juveniles, ages 13 and
15, Morgenthau said. The adults face a maximum sentence of 25 years
to life if convicted on the murder charge. The juveniles would face
up to nine years to life.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Monday cleared the way for a
retrial of former congressman Robert Garcia on charges he extorted
payments from the scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp.
   U.S. District Judge Leonard B. Sand denied a ``double jeopardy''
motion that claimed Garcia, a Bronx Democrat, and his wife, Jane,
could not be tried twice for the same offense after an appeals
court reversed their October 1989 convictions.
   ``One might argue that a defendant should be required to run the
gauntlet of the criminal process only once and that if a conviction
fails for any reason to pass appellate muster, the defendant must
go free,'' Sand wrote in his opinion.
   ``But the Supreme Court of the United States has clearly
established ... the law is otherwise.''
   Ronald Fischetti, the lawyer representing Mrs. Garcia, said they
had not decided whether to appeal Sand's ruling. Garcia's attorney,
Robert Morvillo, was unavailable for comment, his office said.
   Their new trial was scheduled to begin Jan. 21.
   A three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
reversed the couple's convictions in June on grounds there was
insufficient evidence to prove one of two prosecution theories
supporting the extortion charge.
   The appeals court ruled that since the jurors did not specify
which theory they adopted, the Garcias should be retried.
   Under Sand's ruling, the new trial will focus on the theory that
the Garcias used the congressman's political office to obtain
payoffs from Wedtech, a Bronx-based military contractor that
collapsed in 1986 in the midst of a corruption scandal.
   The appeals court rejected the theory that Garcia and his wife
intimidated Wedtech officers into making the payments.
   The indictment accuses the Garcias of extorting monthly payments
totaling $76,000 and obtaining a $20,000 interest-free loan from
Wedtech in 1984 in return for future favors.
   Garcia, 58, resigned his seat in Congress in January after he
and his wife were sentenced by Sand to three years in prison with
the recommendation they be released on parole after six months.
   He began serving his sentence in March but was released in June
after the appellate court's decision.
   Other politicians convicted in the Wedtech scandal were former
U.S. Rep. Mario Biaggi and a former Bronx borough president,
Stanley Simon.

<HEAD>Woman Sentenced to Prison for Killing Husband After Custody Battle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CIRCLEVILLE, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who killed her former husband
after he won custody of their child, the product of a surrogate
contract, was sentenced Monday to 11 years in prison.
   Beverly Seymour, 45, claimed she shot Richard Reams, 47, while
trying to protect herself.
   Ms. Seymour showed no reaction when Judge William Ammer of
Pickaway County Common Pleas Court sentenced her to eight years in
prison for voluntary manslaughter plus three years because she used
a handgun.
   She will be eligible for parole after 8{ years in prison.
   Ms. Seymour was originally charged with murder in the slaying.
But after a three-week trial, the jury convicted her Thursday of
the lesser charge.
   In a statement before her sentencing, Ms. Seymour told the judge
that Reams had beaten her and was about to again when she shot him.
Her trial defense had been that the gun fired accidentally.
   ``I'm guilty of being a woman not wanting to be hit by that
man's fists again,'' she said.
   Defense lawyers didn't say whether they would appeal.
   The slaying of Reams followed a three-way custody battle for
5-year-old Tessa Reams. Ms.
   Tessa was born in 1985 to Norma Lee Stotski, who was paid
$10,000 to be artificially inseminated and bear a child for the
couple. The sperm was from a donor other than Reams.
   The couple divorced in 1986. Reams and Ms. Seymour fought over
the girl's custody as did Ms. Stotski.
   A juvenile court judge ultimately awarded Reams permanent
custody of the child and gave Ms. Seymoure visitation rights. Ms.
Stotski won no rights to see the child.
   Reams was shot Aug. 27, the day he went to Ms. Seymour's
apartment to pick up Tessa after his court victory.
   At her trial, Ms. Seymour claimed Reams was shot during a
confrontation when she went for her gun and it accidentally
discharged.
   But prosecutor Randy Knece said Ms. Seymour killed Reams because
she was angry he had won custody of the child.
   Ms. Stotski sought Tessa's custody after the shooting, but
permanent custody was awarded to Franklin County Children's
Services.

<TEXT>
   More than 1,400 children under the age of
5 have died because of shortages of medicine, vaccines and food
caused by the U.N.-backed trade embargo against Iraq, the country's
health minister said Monday.
   Abdul-Salam Mohammed Saeed said many of the 1,416 children had
not received the proper medication or sufficient milk because of
shortages, the official Iraqi News Agency reported.
   It did not specify the diseases or the vaccines in short supply,
although officials have said in the past that polio vaccine was
scarce.
   INA said Saeed cited the World Health Organization's 1978
document known as ``Health for all by the year 2000.''
   ``He said how could health for all be achieved while unjust
resolutions denying Iraqi children vaccines and medicines
existed?'' the news agency said.
   The minister also noted the World Summit on Children held in New
York in September, which called for promoting children's health and
nourishment, reducing infant mortality and providing basic
requirements of children.

   A jetliner clipped another while preparing
to take off from the Detroit airport in heavy fog Monday, igniting
a fire that left one plane in smoking ruins. Eight people were
killed and at least 21 injrred, officials said.
   It was not immediately clear what caused the collision between a
DC-9 and a Boeing 727-200, both operated by Northwest Airlines. A
spokesman for air traffic controllers said the DC-9 appeared to
have become lost on a slick, foggy taxiway and strayed into the
727's path.
   For nearly an hour after the accident, smoke billowed out of the
fuselage of the DC-9, where passengers apparently became trapped by
the fast-moving fire. By the time the fire was extinguished, much
of the plane's roof was open to the overcast sky.
   Officials had initially said that 19 people were killed, but
Northwest officials and Wayne County Executive Edward McNamara
later said that was wrong.
   McNamara said the medical examiner had ``swept through the
wreckage twice'' and found eight bodies.
   Northwest spokesman Doug Miller said the airline had checked
passenger lists and accounted for everyone except eight people, who
were presumed to be the victims. He said 21 people remained in
hospitals Monday evening.
   The DC-9, Flight 1482 to Pittsburgh, was carrying 39 passengers
and four crewmembers, according to the airline. The 727, Flight 299
to Memphis, was carrying 146 passengers.
   Both flights had originated in Detroit, said Patrick McCann, a
Northwest spokesman at its headquarters in Eagan, Minn.
   ``Apparently the right wing of the 727 hit the aft section, the
engine, of the DC9, taking the engine off,'' said Alan Muncaster,
another Northwest spokesman. ``That resulted in the fire. That, at
this point, is all we know.''
   At the time of the crash, visibility was poor and the ground was
wet from a morning snow and sleet storm that delayed flights at
Detroit Metropolitan Airport. Muncaster said the airport had been
closed to inbound traffic but that planes were being allowed to
take off.
   Tony Dresden, a spokesman for the National Air Traffic
Controllers Association, a union representing air traffic
controllers, said there was about a quarter-mile visibility in the
air, but only about 800 feet on the ground.
   ``We've had some discussions with our people out there,''
Dresden said. ``The DC-9 pilot became lost on the runways. The
pilot gave the ground controller erroneous information about his
position and turned right onto the runway where the 727 was
taxiing.
   ``The DC-9 pilot discovered at the very last moment where he
was, and so the ground controller told him to immediately get off
that runway, but it was too late.''
   He stressed that his information was preliminary. The Federal
Aviation Administration, which supervises air traffic controllers,
did not immediately comment about Dresden's statement.
   Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board were
being dispatched to begin a probe aimed at determining the cause of
the accident, a safety board spokesman said.
   One survivor from the DC-9, 41-year-old John Izzo, said he was
dozing when he ``heard a bang, felt a thud and then all of a
sudden, there was a blast.''
   ``I saw the fire to the right rear. The whole top burned away,
but something was definitely blown away because something flew over
my head,'' said Izzo, a Westinghouse nuclear engineer who was
returning to Pittsburgh from a business trip.
   Izzo said he escaped by jumping from a wing to the ground. He
was not hurt.
   ``The people that made it down and out were crawling through the
slush into the middle of the field,'' he said. ``I just watched the
fire spread across the plane and engulf the entire fuselage.''
   Izzo said he was seated in Row 10 and believes people in the
rows behind him could not get out.
   ``The only thing going through my mind was `I'm going to die in
this damn plane and I'm only 26 years old,''' said another
passenger, medical student Mike Marrone of Saddle River, N.J.
   ``I wanted to get out of there and I think a lot of other people
did too. I didn't see too many acts of heroism,'' Marrone said.
   The body of the 727 did not appear to have been seriously
damaged in the collision. One passenger, 60-year-old Robert Karp of
Jackson, Miss., said passengers from the 727 walked off the plane
and down the stairs.
   ``It sounded to me like it was a loud thump,'' said Karp, a
professor at Jackson State University.
   ``I thought the tire had blown out. The front end of the plane
had begun to lift off. I don't think the back wheels were off the
ground yet. As soon as I heard the thump we came to an abrupt stop.
I remember looking at the other plane and seeing smoke rolling
out.''
   Three men who earlier had identified themselves as pilots were
sitting across the aisle from him. One of them said, ``Oh, my God,
our entire wing is gone,'' according to Karp.
   McNamara said the only injuries on the Boeing were those that
occurred during the plane's evacuation.
   Muncaster said the DC-9's pilot and co-pilot were injured, but
the pilots of both aircraft were able to provide statements for
authorities. Northwest did not reveal what the pilots said.
   The 727 ``wasn't airborne'' but was ``on a takeoff roll,''
Muncaster said, but could not estimate how fast it was traveling.
Its passengers evacuated through the rear of the plane, whose right
wing was sheared off, he said.
   Linda Kalinsky of the Taylor Ambulance Co. said there were 50 or
60 injuries altogether, including some burn victims.
   Twenty-one injured were taken to four hospitals in the area,
including two who were taken to the University of Michigan Medical
Center Burn Center at Ann Arbor.
   Muncaster said surviving passengers were taken to the airport
Marriot hotel, where a family center was set up.
   As dusk settled in around 4 p.m., a stand of huge lights were
wheeled into place near the cockpit of the DC-9 on Runway 3C to
allow firefighters and investigators to see.
   At about 5 p.m., rescue workers hoisted body bags from the DC-9
and handed them to others on a wing.
   In Northwest's offices at Greater Pittsburgh International
Airport, 12 to 15 people waited for information on family members
and friends, said Bruce Nelson, director of sales and marketing for
the airline's Pittsburgh office.
   ``They are very quiet,'' Nelson said at a news conference.
``They've just been told that we're trying to get a passenger list
and get things in order.''
   Romulus, about 10 miles west of Detroit, was the site of the
second worst air crash in U.S. history, the Aug. 16, 1987, crash of
a Northwest MD-80,on takeoff in which 156 people were killed.

<HEAD>Daily News Files RICO Suit Against Union Group, Drivers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Daily News has filed a $150 million civil
racketeering lawsuit against union groups and drivers for allegedly
conspiring to force the News to either accept wasteful contracts or
sell the paper to them.
   More incidents of violence or threats of violence were reported
in the 6-week-old strike against the newspaper. On Dec. 2, two
replacement drivers were charged with possessing an unlicensed gun,
a pipe bomb was found near the paper's Brooklyn plant and a striker
was charged with assaulting a News hawker.
   On another front, the Daily News obtained a court order
permitting hawkers to sell the paper on subway platforms and at
railroad stops after the Metropolitan Transportation Authority
canceled permits.
   The transportation agency said it acted because of concerns that
strikers would set up picket lines that would be honored by transit
workers, creating a work slowdown that might halt operations.
   On Dec. 3, first day of the transit sales, there were no reports
of problems with Daily News hawkers at subway stations. Transit
officials had no count of how many hawkers were selling at 60
approved sites around the city, but Caren Gardner of the TA said,
``There doesn't appear to be many out there.''
   The newspaper's civil lawsuit against the unions was filed in
U.S. District Court in Manhattan on Nov. 29 and alleges violations
of the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO. The
suit claims that a conspiracy exists involving attempted murder,
coercion, arson and robbery. Named are the Newspaper and Mail
Deliverers' Union of New York and Vicinity, the Allied Printing
Trades Council, the umbrella group representing the nine striking
unions, and 23 drivers, some of whom have been arrested during the
strike.
   The lawsuit claims the groups want to force the paper to accept
a settlement that contains abuses the News has tried to end in 10
months of negotiations.
   The News also claimed that through violence the unions hoped to
implement a buyout plan organized by Theodore Kheel, the unions'
unpaid legal adviser. Kheel is not being sued.
   A 6-inch pipe bomb was found Dec. 2 near a parking area at the
company's Brooklyn printing plant, police said. Nearby were two
unexploded, M-80 firecrackers taped to boxes of nails.
   Police had gone there to investigate 12 explosions, apparently
caused by firecrackers. Sgt. Peter Sweeney, a police spokesman,
said one man was arrested for throwing a bottle that hit an
officer. Four demonstrators were also arrested for disorderly
conduct.
   In separate incidents the same day, police said two News
replacement drivers were charged with weapons possession after a
loaded .25-caliber handgun was found in the front seat of their
truck, and a striking pressman was charged in the assault of a
Daily News hawker.
   The strike by about 2,100 workers began Oct. 25.

<HEAD>Murdoch Hopes To Reach Debt Agreement by Early January</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. says it hopes to
reach an agreement with bankers by early January on a new financing
plan that would defer repayment on about $5 billion in debt for the
next three years.
   The Australian-based company has amassed a large debt by
aggressively expanding into newspapers, book publishing, movie and
TV production, television stations and magazines.
   But unexpectedly slow assets sales, economic weakness in Britain
and Australia and a sluggish advertising market in the United
States have made it tough to keep up with debt payments.
   Murdoch has met over the past few weeks with groups of bankers
in Australia, Europe and the United States to outline a proposal to
consolidate about $6.5 billion in bank loans otherwise due by
mid-1993.
   An executive source close to the News Corp. chief executive but
speaking on condition of anonymity said Nov. 29 that Murdoch made
the proposal because principal payments are coming due that the
company would have trouble paying.
   Under terms of the proposed package, only $1.4 billion in bank
loans would have to be repaid by December 1993, the executive said.
The company would then hope to renegotiate the remainder by early
1994, he said.
   In exchange for permitting the debt deferral, the bankers would
get higher rates of interest and other fees. The company has also
told the bankers it plans to sell about $1 billion in assets over
the next two years.
   As part of the refinancing proposal, News Corp. would get a $600
million bridge loan that would have to be repaid in mid-1992. The
bridge loan would give the company the ability to make interest
payments, meet business expenses and allow extra time to arrange
asset sales.
   News Corp. purchased the book publisher Harper &amp; Row, 20th
Century Fox Film Corp., several television stations and Triangle
Publications, the owner of TV Guide and The Daily Racing Form, in
the past few years.
   Under its existing loan agreemnt, News Corp. would have had to
pay back $2.4 billion in both bank loans and public debt by next
June, another $1.4 billion by June 1992 and $3 billion by June
1993.
   The new agreement would require no repayments by next June, $1.2
billion including the bridge loan by June 1992 and another $800
million by June 1993 with the chance for delaying the final payment
until December 1993.

<HEAD>Renfrew Leaving Reuters After 10 Years as Chief Executive</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Glen Renfrew, who guided Reuters through a decade
of strong profit growth, will step down as chief executive in
March, the company announced Nov. 29.
   He will be replaced by Peter Job, a 49-year-old Reuters veteran
who started as a journalist before moving up the management ladder
to his current post as managing director for Reuters in Asia.
   The announcement comes during a bumpy but still profitable year
for Reuters which, Renfrew said, included a high number of
cancellations of the company's financial services.
   Earlier in November the company said it would cut 300 jobs from
its work force of 10,500 and delay the launch of a new automatic
foreign exchange dealing system because of unsettled market
conditions.
   Reuters Chairman Sir Christopher Hogg told a news conference
that Renfrew's departure had nothing to do with the company's
performance this year. The agency said it still would have record
pre-tax profits of about $627 million, even after absorbing
severance pay worth $19.6 million.
   Hogg said Renfrew, 62, had informed the board 15 months ago of
his decision to retire after a successor had been picked.
   ``The whole process has been a planned one,'' said Hogg, who
paid tribute to Renfrew for leading Reuters through ``a period of
quite outstanding growth and prosperity'' as chief executive and
managing director.
   Hogg said Renfrew had already stayed two years beyond the normal
pensionable age for senior Reuters executives. Mandatory retirement
is at 65.
   Neil Blackley, a media analyst at the brokerage James Capel and
Co., also said it would be wrong to link Reuters' recent
difficulties with Renfrew's leaving next March.
   ``He had a decade of meteoric profit growth but the last nine
months have been difficult,'' Blackley said. ``It's a shame he has
to end on that note.''
   Blackley said he was pleased with the appointment of Job, whom
he described as very talented.
   Job, a graduate of Oxford University, served as a foreign
correspondent and news executive in India, Malaysia, Indonesia,
Britain and Latin America before moving into business management in
1974. He has been head of Reuters Asia since 1988.
   Renfrew, an Australian, joined Reuters in London in 1952 after
graduating from Sydney University. He was in charge of Reuters'
North American operations from 1971 until his promotion to chief
executive in 1981.
   When he took over as CEO, Reuters was owned by a publishers'
association representing newspapers in Britian, Ireland, Australia
and New Zealand. It had 2,700 employees then.
   Renfrew guided Reuters through a complicated transformation into
a public company, Reuters Holdings PLC, in 1984. In the past five
years pre-tax profits have risen steadily, with each year setting a
new record.
   Renfrew sold 20 percent of his personal holdings in the company
last August for about $3.37 million. That left him with 849,378
shares, worth $10.55 million the day his departure was announced.

<HEAD>FNN Owner Expects To Report $72.5 Million Loss for Fiscal 1990</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financial News Network Inc. said Nov. 29 it
expects to report a $72.5 million loss for fiscal 1990.
   The company, whose biggest shareholder is the owner of the
United Press International wire service, also said it expects to
report a loss of $25 million for the first quarter of its current
fiscal year.
   The company has been unable to report its financial results for
the fiscal year ended June 30 because it replaced its auditing firm
in a controversy over how FNN was reporting a $28 million
investment in a new service.
   The auditors Deloitte &amp; Touche contended the investment should
have been deducted from quarterly earnings while FNN wanted to
spread the costs over a few years.
   Deloitte left as FNN's auditor in October and the firm Coopers &amp;
Lybrand was brought in to study the FNN annual financial
statements.
   FNN said that its new auditors had ``substantially completed
their examination'' and said it expects to file its audited
financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission in
early December.
   FNN said the anticipated net loss for he year would leave it
with a ``shareholders' deficit of approximately $33.5 million at
June 30.''
   The shareholders' deficit represents an excess of liabilities
over assets.
   The company said it would probably file amended quarterly
reports for the first nine months of fiscal 1990 to reflect
``material changes deemed appropriate as a result of the audit.''
   In addition, it said it expects to report within a few weeks a
$25 million loss for the first fiscal quarter ended Sept. 30.
   FNN said that more than half of the anticipated losses for the
year and the first quarter involves elimination of revenues derived
from affiliated businesses.
   The company did not identify the affiliates, but it is 46
percent owned by Infotechnology Inc., which owns UPI and an
assortment of other media and technology companies.
   It was disclosed last month that the SEC is investigating
Infotechnology for undisclosed reasons. Infotechnology and FNN have
each said they do not have enough cash flow to cover operating
expenses, and are negotiating with those to whom they owe money.
   In late October, Alan J. Hirschfield and Allan R. Tessler were
brought in to succeed Earl Brian as interim co-chief executives at
both Infotechnology and Financial News Network.
   In early November, they said they were putting the companies'
principal operations up for sale, including the FNN cable network
and UPI.
   In the Nov. 29 announcement, Hirschfield and Tessler said FNN's
investment banker, Wertheim &amp; Schroder &amp; Co. Inc., is beginning the
sale process for FNN.
   ``A substantial number of inquires have been received from a
broad representation of media-related companies and others
concerning the proposed sale of FNN,'' the statement said.
   Infotechnology spokeswoman Amber Gordon said she could not
identify who was interested or how many inquiries had been
received. She said the company hopes to conclude negotiations of
the contracts for the sales by the end of the year.
   FNN provides stock quotes, business and financial news and
sports information on a cable TV network to more than 35 million
homes served by 3,500 cable systems in the United States and
Canada.
   It also operates a business radio network and, with
Infotechnology, owns 51 percent of The Learning Channel cable
network.

<HEAD>AP Members Should Re-Examine Their Use of Resources, Daniels Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of The Associated Press need to
reassess how they use their resources and consider reaffirming
their commitment to the news cooperative, the chairman-elect of
AP's board of directors said Dec. 2.
   Members of the AP tend to spend a great deal of money sending
their own reporters to cover major news events rather than use the
AP's coverage, said Frank A. Daniels Jr., president and publisher
of The News &amp; Observer of Raleigh, N.C.
   ``The instinct that so many of us have is that if we don't cover
it ourselves, it isn't as well-done (and) that our readers expect
us to staff certain events,'' Daniels told the Missouri and Kansas
AP publishers and editors at their annual meeting.
   ``There's a lot of merit in that,'' he said. ``But every time we
staff an event we have to forego another event. Or we give up a
position on the copy desk that might have been able to rewrite a
story and present more information more clearly by better
editing.''
   Daniels also urged the group to critique the AP report daily and
call local bureaus with requests and complaints.
   ``The AP is only as good as you want it to be,'' he said.
``Let's work harder at using our cooperative, complementary skills
so that our readers benefit from additional news.
   ``No one newspaper or group of newspapers is as strong as the
cooperative AP. None has the financial resources to be devoted to
gathering news and disseminating it, tapping into the creative
productivity of 1,500 newspapers, each of which shares its
reporting through the AP.''

<HEAD>Lawsuit Claims Reporter Fired From UPI for Being Lesbian</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former United Press International reporter
claims in a $12.75 million lawsuit that she was fired because she
is a lesbian and wrote a free-lance story for a gay publication.
   Julie Brienza's lawsuit was filed Nov. 29 in U.S. District
Court. UPI and Wisconsin Voice of Christian Youth, a
Milwaukee-based religious group, were named as defendants.
   Brienza, who was UPI's Supreme Court reporter, alleged that she
was dismissed under pressure from Vic Eliason, the religious
group's executive director.
   In the suit, Brienza contends that Eliason began a campaign to
have her fired after she interviewed him on April 10 for a
free-lance article she was writing about the influence of the
``religious right'' on broadcasting.
   The suit alleges that Eliason buys news from UPI, and that he
contacted UPI management to complain about Brienza writing for The
Washington Blade, a news weekly. He then urged listeners to his
radio network to jam UPI's telephone lines demanding her dismissal,
the suit said.
   On April 27, UPI fired her, accusing her of violating
free-lancing rules.
   ``UPI terminated Brienza's employment because of her sexual
orientation, and because she was writing a free-lance article for a
gay and lesbian newspaper,'' the suit contends.
   UPI spokesman Milt Capps said Nov. 29 he could not comment on
the suit until he had seen it. But earlier, Capps had denied that
Brienza's firing was due to pressure from religious broadcasters
and said it was based on violations of UPI work rules.
   Officials at Wisconsin Voice of Christian Youth Inc. in
Milwaukee did not immediately return a call seeking comment.
   The suit seeks $750,000 in general damages, plus $12 million in
punitive damages - $10 million from Eliason and $2 million from
UPI. It claims violation of privacy, loss of income and violation
of a District of Columbia law that prohibits discrimination in
employment based on a person's sexual orientation. The suit
contends Wisconsin's ``hate crime'' law also was violated.
   Besides the $12.75 million, the suit seeks return of Brienza's
job, back pay, and a retraction from Eliason and his group.
   The suit acknowledges that Brienza used UPI's internal message
system to retrieve information on Eliason from the news agency's
Milwaukee bureau and that she made two long-distance phone calls
for the story from UPI's Washington office.
   UPI rules, according to the suit, prohibit employees from
free-lancing on company time, doing outside work that could compete
with UPI or writing articles that take an advocacy position.
   But Brienza said at a news conference that her use of company
facilities was minimal and that other UPI employees routinely did
the same for personal reasons or for outside work. She said The
Blade is not an advocacy publication and that she had gotten
permission from UPI management prior to working on the article.
   She said UPI's actions were out of proportion to the offense and
that the issue in her firing really was her sexual orientation.

<HEAD>First Journalist Travels Into Space Aboard Soviet Rocket</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAIKONUR COSMODROME, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Japanese television
reporter became the first journalist in space Dec. 2, riding a
column of fire into orbit aboard a Soviet rocket.
   Journalist Toyohiro Akiyama, 48, joined Soviet cosmonauts Viktor
Afanasyev and Musa Manarov in the Soyuz TM-11 space capsule.
Akiyama was a passenger under a $12 million contract between the
Soviet Union and Japan's biggest private television company, TBS.
   Underscoring the commercial nature of the mission, the Soviet
rocket even had advertising slogans for TBS and other Japanese
companies emblazoned on its sides.
   ``I feel fine,'' Akiyama said minutes before the liftoff. During
the eight-day mission, he will document the experience on radio and
television for TBS.
   The Japanese television company is spending $37 million on the
entire venture to mark its 40th year on the air, according to
network president Izumi Tanaka.
   More than 120 TBS reporters, cameramen and technicians scurried
about the launch control center and reviewing stand to cover the
launch, even sacrificing a remote-control camera next to the rocket
to watch the flames close-up before it burned.
   Akiyama, a TBS news director who quit a four-pack-a-day
cigarette habit during the training, was asked before liftoff what
he looked forward to most on his return from the first trip into
space by a Japanese citizen.
   ``I can't wait to have a smoke,'' he said.
   Akiyama, for whom TBS bought a $2.2 million life insurance
policy, carried stationery, a picture of his family and three
Japanese good-luck charms into space.

<HEAD>NFL: Players Did Act Nasty, Team Slow To Investigate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Football League commissioner
vindicated sports writer Lisa Olson by imposing $22,500 in fines on
three New England Patriots players she accused of sexually taunting
her in the team locker room.
   Commissioner Paul Tagliabue on Nov. 27 also fined the team
$50,000 for being slow to investigate allegations that Zeke Mowatt,
Michael Timpson and Robert Perryman exposed themselves or made lewd
comments to the Boston Herald reporter.
   Mowatt, who earlier was fined $2,000 by the team, was fined
$12,500. Timpson and Perryman were fined $5,000 each. The fines are
likely to hurt their reputations more than their bank accounts, but
Olson said she accepted the penalties.
   ``My satisfaction with the investigation and subsequent
sanctions is surpassed only by my wish the disgraceful incident had
never occurred in the first place,'' she said in a statement.
   ``It was not my choice to have this matter decided in a public
forum, and it is unfortunate that Patriot management forced this to
happen by not dealing with the guilty persons swiftly and
decisively.''
   Tagliabue agreed, saying the team ``did not adequately
investigate and resolve a serious incident of misconduct in the
club's locker room and appeared to condone the misconduct of the
Patriots' players.''
   The commissioner levied the fines based on a 60-page report by
Harvard law professor Philip Heymann on the Sept. 17 incident. The
report by Heymann, as Tagliabue's special counsel, resulted from
107 interviews with 91 people.
   Heymann cited discrepancies between the accounts given by Olson
and several players, but he said Mowatt's story was not credible
and he concluded the reporter suffered sexual taunting by naked
players.
   Tagliabue called the players' actions ``completely uncalled for
and improper. Mowatt's conduct involved both verbal and
demonstrative actions. Timpson and Perryman encouraged the
misconduct.''
   ``The decision has been rendered. Now it's time to get on with
playing football,'' Patriots owner Victor Kiam said in a statement.
The penalties are subject to appeal, but Kiam said the team will
abide by the decision.
   There was no comment immediately afterward from Mowatt, Timpson
or Perryman, who is now with the Dallas Cowboys after being cut by
New England.
   In addition to a $25,000 fine for dragging its feet on the
investigation, the club was ordered to pay another $25,000 to help
pay for instructional materials for all 28 NFL teams on how to deal
with the news media.
   The Patriots are 1-11 this season and have not won since the day
before the incident. A few weeks afterward, Cincinnati Bengals
coach Sam Wyche barred a woman reporter from the locker room.
Tagliabue fined him more than $27,000.

<HEAD>Connecticut City Bans News Racks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MERIDEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Executives from the Record-Journal of
Meriden, The Hartford Courant and the New Haven Register said they
plan to fight on constitutional grounds a directive that bans news
racks from city sidewalks.
   City officials began notifying area newspapers Nov. 29 that the
vending machines had to be removed from sidewalks and certain other
locations.
   A one-sentence section of a local zoning ordinance prohibits
placement of vending machines between a city street and a property
line, effectively banning them from city sidewalks. It also
requires machines on private property to be a certain distance from
the street, although that distance varies depending on the area's
zone designation.
   But newspaper officials said numerous court cases, including a
1988 U.S. Supreme Court decision, have upheld newspapers' First
Amendment right to maintain the machines.
   A letter mailed to the three newspapers said their machines have
to be removed within 30 days. If they are not, cease-and-desist
orders will be issued and the city will begin enforcement actions,
City Planner Dominick J. Caruso said. He said the same letter will
go out to other newspapers that own vending machines in the city.
   But City Manager Michael H. Aldi later said he believes the
ordinance may be unconstitutional, and that intends to seek a legal
opinion to resolve the issue.
   Caruso said the regulation has ``been on the books for a long
time, it's just never been brought up before.'' Caruso said he was
unaware of the law until recently when he received a complaint.
   Eliot C. White, publisher of the Record-Journal and president of
the Record-Journal Publishing Co., said the matter revolves around
``an out-of-date ordinance that's never been enforced, as far as we
know.''
   The Record-Journal maintains 50 vending machines in the city.
   In a 1988 case, the Supreme Court ruled that a Lakewood, Ohio,
official could not prevent a Cleveland newspaper from putting out
news racks by denying them a permit to do so, according to Alice
Neff Lucan, a Washington, D.C., attorney who has handled similar
cases.
   ``It is extremely unlikely in my opinion that just by coloring
this a vending machine issue, they can prevent newspapers from
distributing,'' said Neff Lucan, who represents USA Today, which
owns machines in the city. The distribution and publication of
newspapers is protected by the free speech provisions of the First
Amendment, she said.
   William J. Rush, chief executive officer of the New Haven
Register, said he has seen municipalities try to outlaw news racks.
   ``It's always boiled down to our constitutional rights under the
First Amendment,'' he said. ``We try to be good citizens ... but we
intend to keep our boxes on the street and we intend to protect our
constitutional rights.''
   The Register has about 35 machines in Meriden.
   Raymond A. Jansen, publisher of The Hartford Courant, said his
paper has ``encountered this a number of times over the years, and
we typically try to work with city officials to position the
machines where they'd like to see them.
   ``But if it comes down to not allowing them, we'd view that very
seriously,'' Jansen said. ``We would seek legal advice as to how
the law could be enforced in the face of the First Amendment.''

<HEAD>Newspaper Racks Return to Huntsville Mall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The manager of a shopping mall that
banned newspaper racks changed his mind Nov. 26 after hearing
complaints from several publications, including a black weekly.
   Madison Square Mall manager Joe Black said the issue had been
blown out of proportion. Editor William Smothers of the weekly
Speakin' Out News, who complained that banning the racks amounted
to censorship, speculated that the policy was reversed to protect
the mall's image.
   Black said he became concerned about the number of newspaper
racks and the lack of maintenance of them last year. He had some
removed, and then all of them to avoid the appearance of
favoritism.
   ``We thought this thing had been blown way out of proportion and
it was not deserving,'' Black said after deciding to allow the
racks back. ``We thought it was time for the community to focus on
things more important to Huntsville.''

<HEAD>New Bedford Newspaper Targets Drug Suspects With Published Photos</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The war on drugs has taken a new twist in nearby
New Bedford. The local newspaper, teamed with the chief of police
and a top judge, has begun printing the mug shots of every person
arrested on drug charges.
   ``This newspaper has escalated the importance of crime news
relating to drugs,'' Editor James Ragsdale wrote in The
Standard-Times.
   ``We are now saying that photographing those accused of
drug-related crime is as important as for homicides, manslaughter,
arson and the rest.''
   Although many newspapers run the names of people arrested for
various crimes, and some print the names of men charged with hiring
prostitutes, Ragsdale believes that publishing the pictures of drug
suspects is entirely new.
   ``This is just one of the many things this newspaper is doing to
raise public awareness that there is a drug problem,'' he said.
   Titled ``Drug Watch,'' the daily column begun Nov. 15 requires
one staff photographer and up to 30 inches of newsprint. A recent
edition carried photos of nine men, ranging in age from 17 to 39,
arrested for possession of various drugs, possession with intent to
distribute and conspiracy to violate drug laws.
   Mayor John Bullard praised the paper's efforts. He said New
Bedford's drug problem and related crime are overwhelming. More
than 2,000 drug arrests were made in New Bedford in the first 10
months of 1990.
   Bullard acknowledged that publishing photos may not prevent
hard-core drug use.
   ``But for those people who buy drugs and think they can stay
undercover, this should be a deterrent,'' he said Tuesday.
   Reaction to Drug Watch has been varied, with many local
officials and residents applauding the attempt and some journalists
and lawyers questioning the ethics involved.
   Sarah Wunsch, a lawyer for the Massachusetts Civil Liberties
Union, called the policy sensationalistic. She and others said the
publication of pictures threatens a defendant's right to a fair
trial.
   Ragsdale said his newspaper will make every effort to print the
outcome of each court hearing, even if that happens months or years
after initial publication.

<HEAD>Gov. Deukmejian Reads Column, Rejects Paper's Interview Request</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. George Deukmejian, angered at a column in
the San Francisco Examiner, has rejected the paper's request for a
one-on-one interview but granted personal interviews to other
newspapers, including the Examiner's competitor.
   Bob Gore, a spokesman for the Republcan governor, acknowledged
Nov. 27 that Deukmejian was angered by an Oct. 1 column by writer
Bill Mandel, who criticized the governor's fiscal policies relating
to health care and social programs. The column appeared under the
headline, ``Hell is Too Good for Deukmejian.''
   ``It went beyond fair comment,'' Gore said when asked why the
interview request had been denied. ``I think if you read your
editorial page lately you might figure out why you are in the
second round of interviews.''
   The Examiner has been offered a group interview with the
governor, along with The Associated Press, Gannett News Service,
the Political Pulse, a Sacramento-based political newsletter, and
United Press International.
   Three newspapers have been given one-on-one interviews: The San
Francisco Chronicle, the San Diego Tribune and the Los Angeles
Times.
   ``Those represent the three major urban areas in the state,''
Gore said. Among those that were denied personal interviews were
the San Jose Mercury News, the San Diego Union and The Sacramento
Bee.
   Frank McCulloch, the Examiner's managing editor, said it
appeared the governor had made a decision on access based upon a
newspaper's editorial comment. The ``columns and editorials have
nothing to do with the news columns. No one on the editorial page
has any authority over the news columns,'' he said.
   McCulloch added that newspaper columnists ``are constrained only
by their by broad good taste, which is pretty hard to measure
anyway.'' The refusal to allow a one-on-one interview ``may not be
all that serious but in this competitive world it's a
disadvantage.''

<HEAD>Court Upholds Libel Judgment Against Kentucky Post</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Kentucky Supreme Court has upheld a
libel judgment against The Kentucky Post won by a prosecutor who
claimed the newspaper defamed him.
   The court, in a unanimous ruling Nov. 29, also upheld the
$175,000 jury award to Campbell Commonwealth's Attorney Louis A.
Ball for compensatory damages from the newspaper, reporter Al
Salvato and the E.W. Scripps Co., which owns the Post. No punitive
damages were awarded.
   The newspaper published front-page stories on Nov. 17 and 19,
1984, titled ``Portrait of a Prosecutor'' outlining what the paper
said was Ball's poor record as prosecutor.
   Included was a comment from a former narcotics officer who said
criminals ``couldn't have a better friend'' than Ball.
   The court's ruling said there was ample evidence the newspaper
printed erroneous material that it knew was wrong or made
insufficient effort to determine if it was wrong.
   The circumstances surrounding the newspaper's reporting and
publishing of the story all led to the conclusion the articles were
printed maliciously, the court said.
   ``We include in the circumstances surrounding publication the
way in which the articles were laid out, the evidence regarding
malice ... and the failure to make any retraction,'' Justice
Charles Leibson said in the opinion.
   Kentucky Post Editor Judith Clabes called the ruling ``gravely
disappointing.''
   ``It's an unbecoming decision from a political body that has
demonstrated in a number of instances that, when it comes to the
press, politics and emotions are more controlling than the law,''
she said.
   The court ``completely ignored the facts of the case and
misrepresented the facts of the case,'' Clabes said.

<HEAD>Court: Hearings for Professionals Can Be Closed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York's top court ruled Nov. 27 that
Regents' disciplinary hearings involving doctors and other
professionals should be closed to the public unless those accused
of misconduct want them open.
   The Court of Appeals ruled unanimously against the Johnson
Newspaper Corp., publisher of the Watertown Daily Times, which had
argued that hearings conducted by the state Board of Regents should
be open.
   The state Board of Regents is responsible for disciplining 32
licensed professions, including doctors, nurses, architects and
veteranarians. Traditionally, the Regents have kept their
misconduct cases against professionals confidential until they
decide a person's guilt or innocence, said Christopher Carpenter,
state Education Department spokesman.
   The Daily Times in April 1988 sought access to a disciplinary
hearing involving a Watertown dentist. That hearing has been held
up pending determination of this case.
   The Court of Appeals said nothing in state law or tradition
supports opening the hearings to the public.

   The state's open records law would be
meaningless if it did not apply to a University of South Carolina
foundation that has received and spent public money, two news
organizations told the state Supreme Court Nov. 27.
   ``The decision of this court ... will determine whether this
powerful law is really meaningful or whether this is a make-believe
world of form over substance,'' said Wallace Lightsey, attorney for
The Associated Press and The Greenville News.
   The Carolina Research and Development Foundation has appealed a
lower court order to make the records public.
   Circuit Judge Carol Connor ruled in June 1989 that the
foundation was subject to the Freedom of Information Act because it
accepted and spent about $28 million in public money. Her order was
set aside pending the outcome of the foundation's appeal to the
Supreme Court.
   Foundation attorney Hoover Blanton said the FOI law should not
apply to a private group unless a large amount of the group's
budget came from public money.
   Attorneys did not expect a ruling until next year.

<HEAD>Court Keeps Alive Fair-Housing Suit Over Condo Ads</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Nov. 26 refused to kill
two fair-housing lawsuits stemming from newspaper real estate
advertisements showing only white models posing as homeowners.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that forces
developers of a Virginia condominium community to defend themselves
in a jury trial against allegations they violated federal law.
   The suits center on ads that appeared in The Washington Post
over a 17-month period beginning in 1985 for Colonial Village, a
condo community in Arlington, just across the Potomac River from
the District of Columbia.
   The suits were filed by Girardeau Spann, a black resident of
Washington who is a professor at Georgetown University's law
school, and two advocacy groups - the Metropolitan Washington
Planning and Housing Association and the Fair Housing Council of
Greater Washington.
   Named as defendants are Colonial Village Inc., and its parent
firm, Mobil Land Development Corp., a subsidiary of the oil
company.
   The lawsuits allege that the defendants violated the Fair
Housing Act by featuring only white models in ads that appeared in
the Post. The suits said the ads were racially preferential and
discriminatory, and they sought an injunction and monetary damages.
   A federal trial judge in 1987 threw out the suits, ruling they
had been filed too late.
   But the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here reinstated them last
March 13, and sent the dispute back to U.S. District Judge Harold

   The Pulitzer Prize Board said Nov. 26 it has
renamed and redefined two journalism categories.
   The category that had been General News Reporting has been
renamed Spot News Reporting, and will be given for local reporting
of spot news. It was formerly given for local reporting of spot
news or consistent beat coverage.
   The category that had been Specialized Reporting has been
renamed Beat Reporting. Its former definition was ``for reporting
on such specialized subjects as sports, business, science,
education or religion.''
   Now, the category will cover ``any form of consistent,
specialized reporting, from police beat coverage to religion
writing,'' said Robert C. Christopher, board secretary and prize
administrator.
   ``The board's intention was to give these two category
definitions greater clarity and simplicity and eliminate any

   The deadline is Feb. 1 for submitting articles, photographs and
cartoons published in daily or weekly U.S. newspapers during 1990.
The winners will be announced April 9, 1991.
   The other journalism categories are: Public Service,

Makim, was awarded $234,000 (U.S.) in damages Nov. 27 by a jury
that ruled three newspapers defamed her in 1988.
   The jurors found that The Daily Telegraph, The Sunday Telegraph
and The Australian implied Mrs. Makim had an affair with Argentine
polo player Horatio Lanusse and wrongfully attempted or threatened
to remove her two children from Australia.
   Mrs. Makim, the 33-year-old sister of the former Sarah Ferguson,
now Britain's Duchess of York, said, ``My reputation has been
totally vindicated.'' In addition to the award, Nationwide News,
publisher of the three Sydney-based newspapers, must pay interest
and Mrs. Makim's legal fees.
   Mrs. Makim was separated from her rancher husband, Alex Makim,
11 months ago. She wept as she told the jury she was ``embarrassed
and humiliated'' by the articles. The publisher's attorney, Ian
Callinan, argued she suffered no damage from the stories.

   Information Minister Harmoko was
quoted Nov. 29 as defending government restrictions on foreign
journalists, saying it will continue to ban those who offend
Indonesia's leader.
   The comment followed government banning of a New York Times
reporter who wrote an article saying President Suharto's children
enjoy lucrative business ties to most major government projects.
   ``We will be consistent. I will blacklist such journalists,''
Harmoko said Nov. 28, according to news reports. He spoke after the

   Harmoko said the policy applied only to foreign publications

<HEAD>Britain's Sunday Correspondent Closes After 14 Months</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Sunday Correspondent, a nationally distributed
weekly newspaper launched last year, has closed after failing to
meet circulation targets.
   The newspaper was started at a cost of $25.5 million and
included the Chicago Tribune among its shareholders.
   Sales of the paper fell below the 350,000 figure needed to break
even and last August shareholders pumped in another $19 million to
keep it going. The paper's chief executive, Nick Shott, said Nov.
27 that its final circulation had fallen to 210,000.
   The closing leaves Britain with 10 national weekly Sunday
newspapers.
   Like its competitors and TV and radio stations, the paper has
been hit by falling advertising revenue in Britain's current
economic recession.
   Shott said the closing will mean the loss of about 200 jobs.

<HEAD>Report: CBS Considers Stock Buyback</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS Inc. is considering a share repurchase
program, following the disclosure that it expects a fourth-quarter
loss and lower earnings next year, a published report said.
   The media company's stock fell after the Nov. 19 earnings
forecast, although it gained ground later along with other media
stocks.
   The Wall Street Journal said Nov. 29 that people familiar with
the proposal said CBS is considering a so-called Dutch auction as
one share buyback option.
   In a Dutch auction, a company states the number of shares it
wants to buy in a specified period and gives a price range within
which shareholders may tender their shares. The company then
selects a price in the range that will enable it to buy all the
shares it needs.
   That might enable CBS to buy back part or all of the 8 percent
stake held by the estate of the late CBS founder, William S. Paley.
   Paley's shares are to be divided among his six children but may
have to be sold to cover tax obligations.
   CBS had no immediate comment on the report.
   In the earnings forecast, CBS said it expected to post a loss in
the fourth quarter compared with earnings of about $60 million in
the same period a year ago because of losses at its CBS Television
Network.
   CBS has only posted one other quarterly loss from continuing
operations in its history, and that was $20 million in the fourth
quarter of 1986.
   The company also said it expects its earnings from continuing
operations in 1991 will be down from this year because of a weak ad
climate and rising costs for entertainment programs and sports
rights.

<HEAD>`60 Minutes' Target of Lawsuit, Letter Campaign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Washington apple growers are suing CBS and
an environmental group over a ``60 Minutes'' report they say
damaged their livelihood by creating a scare about the growth
chemical Alar.
   In a separate dispute in Youngstown, Ohio, college students and
the head of a local public relations firm plan to send a form
letter to newspapers across the country, claiming another segment
on the show inaccurately portrayed their city.
   The Alar lawsuit, filed Nov. 28 in state court, seeks
unspecified damages running to millions of dollars for losses it
said were caused by the program's ``false, misleading,
scientifically unreliable statements.''
   The industry has estimated growers lost more than $100 million
following the 1989 broadcast, which was based on a report by the
Natural Resources Defense Council, a consumer group.
   ``We believe the broadcast highlighted an important public
health matter,'' said Roy Brunett, spokesman for ``60 Minutes.''
``It was well researched and well documented and we expect a
lawsuit ... to be dismissed.''
   The Washington, D.C.-based consumer group said it stood behind
the report.
   The Youngstown dispute concerns a Nov. 11 segment featuring an
interview with U.S. Rep. James Traficant, who expressed concern for
the city's economy. Correspondent Morley Safer described the city
as ``practically an industrial ghost town.''
   Vic Rubenstein, president of the public relations firm,
Rubenstein Associates, said the city's letter-writing campaign was
intended to correct what he said was a misconception.
   The letter said Youngstown has made a comeback: ``Although there
is still lingering pain caused by the closing of our steel mills,
we have recovered far better than so many communities of like
circumstances,'' it said.
   Rubenstein said the letters, signed by ``a dozen caring
Youngstown State University students,'' should reach about 1,500
newspapers.
   Brunett said the segment was accurate and was not intended to
insult anyone.

   Whittle Communications said Nov. 26 that more
than 5,700 schools have signed contracts for its commercially
sponsored Channel One news show for teens and that it expects to
reach its goal of 8,600 schools by June.
   Chairman Christopher Whittle said all of the service's available
commercial time has been either sold or optioned for sale to 13
different advertisers for the January-June period.
   Ed Winter, the Whittle executive overseeing Channel One, told
reporters at a news briefing that Channel One should generate $65
million in gross revenue this school year.
   The Channel One service has been widely criticized by national
education groups for bringing paid advertising into the classroom,
when children are required by law to be in school and must sit and
watch.
   Each 12-minute show includes two minutes of paid commercials for
products such as breath mints, candy bars, movies and toothpaste.

<TEXT>
   President Bush opened a five-country
South America visit today to show support for the historic shift to
democratic rule and for policies aimed at ending long years of
economic stagnation.
   Bush seemed in good spirits as he arrived at dawn at a military
air base here. He smiled and shook hands as he was greeted by
Foreign Minister Francisco Rezek and an air force honor guard. Bush
was driven to the U.S. Embassy residence to await his formal
welcoming ceremony with President Fernando Collor de Mello at
Planalto Palace.
   Bush's plane arrived at dawn in the Brazilian capital of
Brasilia, and the president was proceeding to talks with President
Fernando Collor de Mello and a speech to a joint session of the
Brazilian Congress.
   There are no urgent issues to be discussed, but Bush wants to
associate himself with what he sees as a rare opportunity in
hemispheric relations. The first four countries on Bush's itinerary
- Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina and Chile - all were under military
rule within the last few years and now have elected governments.
The fifth country, Venezuela, has been democratic since 1958. Bush
is making the trip at a time of unusual harmony in U.S.-Latin
American relations.

   Saddam Hussein says he expects the Palestinian question to be on
the agenda of talks with U.S. officials on preventing war, for
which Iraq has shown itself to be preparing with the test-firing of
medium-range missiles.
   The surface-to-surface missiles, with a range of 400 miles, were
fired and landed Sunday within Iraqi territory.
   Iraq fitted similar weapons with conventional warheads during
its eight-year war with Iran, but they could also be equipped with
chemical weapons, Defense Secreatary Dick Cheney said in an
interview on ABC-TV.
   The U.S. military refused to confirm or deny reports that allied
forces in the Persian Gulf went on alert after detecting the
missiles, presumably with spy satellites or AWACS airborne
early-warning radar planes.
   ---&equals;
   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Bush administration says Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein poses a long-term threat to world peace and ``has to
be dealt with'' even if he withdraws Iraqi troops from Kuwait and
frees western hostages.
   In television appearances Sunday, administration officials
promised Iraq a peaceful way to end its occupation of Kuwait but
still branded the Iraqi leader as a dangerous man whose larger
military ambitions must be checked.
   ``There's never been any suggestion that force would be used if
the U.N. resolutions were fully complied with,'' Secretary of State
James A. Baker III said on NBC-TV's ``Meet The Press.''
   ``That would give some assurance, it seems to me, that if he
complied with the resolutions, his reward for that would not be a
military attack by the United States,'' Baker said.

   BONN, Germany (AP) - Opposition parties who showed reluctance to
jump on Chancellor Helmut Kohl's reunification steamroller were
largely left by the wayside in the first free all-German elections
in nearly 60 years.
   For the environmentalist Greens, Sunday's vote spelled disaster.
   Kohl's center-right governing coalition won 54.8 percent of the
vote, compared to 335 percent for the main opposition Social
Democrats, who were led by Oskar Lafontaine, according to nearly
complete official results.
   The elections marked the first free balloting in a united
Germany since Adolf Hitler's rise to power ended in the devastation
of World War II.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - A published report today says the FBI is
conducting a criminal investigation that could lead to charges
against two of the so-called ``Keating Five'' senators.
   The Washington Times, quoting unidentified congressional and law
enforcement sources, said the ``wide-ranging'' investigation
involved allegations of vote trading and bribery against Sens. Alan
Cranston and Dennis DeConcini.
   The report comes as the Senate Ethics Committee this week shifts
the focus of its hearings into the matter to Cranston, the major
beneficiary of $1.3 million in Senate campaign contributions from
savings and loan owner Charles H. Keating Jr.
   The Times said also that an FBI source had confirmed for the
newspaper that a federal grand jury sitting in California was
reviewing evidence involving Cranston, D-Calif., and DeConcini,
D-Ariz. The newspaper said it had no other details on that matter.

   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) - Trouble with the $150 million Astro
observatory today delayed Columbia astronauts' probe of some of the
hottest spots in the universe.
   NASA officials had trouble calibrating the observatory's
instrument pointing system - which affects all three telescopes -
and also had problems with a computer that controls the movements
of one telescope.
   Mission scientist Gene Urban at Marshall Space Flight Center in
Huntsville, Ala., remained confident.
   ``The mission is poised to do extremely good science. We are in
an extremely good orbit and three of the experiments (telescopes)
have been activated almost completely,'' he said early today.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Aaron Copland, the immigrants' son from Brooklyn
who used jazz rhythms of the South, folk songs of Appalachia and
cowboy tunes of the prairie to create classical music that was
unmistakably American, has died at 90.
   The composer, who lived in Peekskill, died Sunday at Phelps
Memorial Hospital in North Tarrytown of pneumonia. He had suffered
two strokes recently.
   The ``dean of American music'' created such classics as
``Appalachian Spring,'' ``Rodeo,'' ``Billy the Kid'' and ``Lincoln
Portrait.'' Leonard Bernstein once called Copland's 1942 orchestral
composition ``Fanfare for the Common Man'' the ``all-time top of
the hit parade in American music.''
   The son of Eastern European immigrants, he strove to be more
American than most Americans and sought to focus the international
spotlight on his fellow American composers.

   MARKED TREE, Ark. (AP) - Dozens of schools along the New Madrid
Fault canceled classes today just in case the earth rumbles as
forecast. And farm animals will decide whether classes should be
held in one Illinois county.
   Judy Byrd of Evansville, Ind., gave in to her 11-year-old son's
request to stay home even though she doesn't believe earthquakes
can be forecast.
   ``At this age, they really worry about everything. War. An
earthquake. Water. The environment,'' Mrs. Byrd said. ``I figured
if he really was that worried about it, it should be up to him.''
   The nervousness was prompted by New Mexico climatologist Iben
Browning's forecast of a 50-50 chance for a major earthquake along
the fault this week.

   FREDERICK, Md. (AP) - The Russians asking questions about
basketball over the Moscow-to-Washington hot line? The Cold War
really must be over.
   Experts manning the hot line, which was to be rededicated today
afeer a $4.7 million upgrade, see evidence of glasnost in test
transmissions from the Soviets. Routine, maintenance-related
dispatches have actually become chatty.
   ``Could we ask an unofficial question about basketball?'' the
Soviets asked last February over the communications link set up
after the Cuban missile crisis to avert the accidental outbreak of
war. ``Could you please tell us how our Kurtinaitis performed
against your snipers?''
   The Soviets were referring to Rimas Kurtinaitis, a 6-foot-5 star
from Lithuania. The National Basketball Association had invited
Kurtinaitis to challenge eight NBA stars in a three-point shooting
contest in Houston. ``Snipers'' apparently was the Soviets'
translation of long-range basketball shooters.

   It's been two years since Pan Am Flight 103
rained down on the Scottish countryside. The lawsuits still are
winding their way through the courts, the investigations continue
and on Sunday comes a British-American docudrama quite unlike its
stateside cousins.
   ``The Tragedy of Flight 103: The Inside Story'' contains no
on-camera crash, no grieving relatives, no buckets of tears.
   This docudrama, co-produced by Britain's Granada Television and
the United States' Home Box Office, is an investigative effort that
serves as an indictment of Pan Am security measures at its
Frankfurt terminal.
   Flight 103, which originated in Frankfurt, exploded over the
Scotland village of Lockerbie on Dec. 21, 1988, as it turned toward
New York on the final leg of its trip. All 259 passengers and crew,
as well as 11 townspeople, were killed.
   Officials of Pan Am, depicted as corporate moguls more concerned
with public image than protecting passengers, have their own view
of the film's findings.
   ``Outright fabrications'' is one. An ``attempt to exploit the
tragedy without regard to the facts'' is another.
   A U.S. presidential commission on aviation security and
terrorism investigated the crash and came up with its own
conclusions in May. One: Much of the blame belonged to inept and
confused Pan Am security personnel. Another: ``The destruction of
Flight 103 may well have been preventable.''
   The 90-minute docudrama, which stars Ned Beatty, Peter Boyle,
Vincent Gardenia, Timothy West and Michael Wincott, is culled from
more than 40 interviews with former Pan Am safety officials and
police officers and reviews of internal memos, government documents
and regulatory reports.
   It recreates damning conversations between former Pan Am
chairman C. Edward Acker and the airline's newly hired security
expert, Fred Ford; alleges serious security flaws at Pan Am's
Frankfurt terminal; and suggests the terrorist blast could have
been avoided if Pan Am had paid greater heed to intelligence
reports warning of such a bombing.
   The program is not the first television treatment of the
Lockerbie crash.
   Connie Chung and the PBS documentary series ``Frontline'' also
looked at the tragedy, which has spawned allegations of cover-ups
against Pan Am and the U.S. government, as well as a voluminous
lawsuit filed by the victims' families alleging willful misconduct
by the airline in allowing the bomb - placed in a radio-cassette
player and packed inside a suitcase - on Flight 103.
   Granada and HBO claim the docudrama, which debuted in Britain on
Nov. 26 ande premieres on HBO at 9 p.m. Sunday, is the most
comprehensive television investigation of the bombing.
   It also is not the first collaboration between Granada
Television and HBO. In August of last year, a joint production
examined the fatal Soviet attack on a Korean Air Line jet in
``Tailspin: Behind the KAL Tragedy.''
   Earlier this year, HBO aired Granada's ``The Investigation:
Inside a Terrorist Bombing,'' which created an uproar in England by
concluding that six Irish men given life sentences for the 1974
bombings of two Birmingham pubs, which killed 21 people and wounded
162 others, were innocent.
   The Lockerbie crash docudrama likewise pulls no punches.
   Struggling to boost air travel after the U.S. bombing of Libya
and the American downing of an Iranian airbus, Pan Am announced an
unprecedented security system designed to offer greater protection
from terrorist retaliation.
   Among the allegations in the Granada-HBO docudrama:
   - A New York press conference staged by Pan Am to introduce its
new ``Alert'' security system actually was a farce featuring
bomb-sniffing canines bought the day before from a regular kennel
and guards who sported fake guns.
   - A $5-per-passenger international surcharge levied by Pan Am to
pay for the new security measures instead went to the airline's
corporate account.
   - The X-ray operator on duty the day the bomb-laden suitcase
made it onto Flight 103 had only one day's training.
   - Pan Am's colorized X-ray machine (which unlike black-and-white
models can detect plastic explosives) was not working the day the
radio-cassette and its plastic explosive device was loaded on the
doomed flight.
   Jeff Kriendler, Pan Am's vice president of corporate
communications, said the allegations represent ``a reckless
disregard of the facts.''
   There was no color X-ray machine in place at the time, Kriendler
said. ``It was on order,'' he said.
   At the New York press conference, Kriendler said, ``there were
no guns.'' The dogs were ``sniffer dogs,'' he said, ``but they may
have been there more for security purposes. I don't know where they
came from.''
   The $5 surcharge funds were directly used for security measures,
he said. And the X-ray operator on duty the day of the bombing had
``several days'' experience, Kriendler said.
   Kriendler declined to say whether Pan Am planned legal action
against HBO and Granada.
   Said Bridget Potter, HBO's senior vice president of original
programming, ``I think my response would be look at the film. The
film speaks for itself.''

   Elsewhere in television ...
   THE SIMPSONS SING, SORT OF: ``The Simpsons Sing the Blues'' was
released this week on Geffen Records. Bad-boy Bart and dad Homer,
mom Marge, sister Lisa and a few friends (B.B. King among them)

All Those Idiots.''

<HEAD>Critics Say Volunteer Miliary Excuses Elite from War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As the possibility of war looms in the Persian
Gulf, debate is being renewed over whether the all-volunteer force
unfairly excuses the elite while the poor and black face the
fighting and dying. Some say a draft would be more fair.
   ``Fewer families are giving more and more,'' says former
Secretary of the Navy James H. Webb.
   Caspar W. Weinberger, secretary of defense during most of the
Reagan administration, scoffed at such criticism in an interview.
   ``What do we want?'' asked Weinberger. ``Do we want a
sociological experiment or do we want the best military we can
get?''
   ``If you force into the military people who don't want to be
there, you are going to have the whole Vietnam scene played all
over again, with people wandering up and down the streets with
signs and people who never want us to participate in any kind of
action,'' he said.
   R. Paul Churchill, an associate professor of philosophy at
George Washington University, said much the same thing from an
entirely different perspective.
   Churchill, a veteran of protest movements who teaches a course
in war and morality, said he hasn't completely made up his mind
about the issue, but added, `We witnessed during the Vietnam War
how threatened a nation that depends on conscription can be by the
apparent willingness of young men to tolerate a great deal of
trouble to avoid a draft.''
   Webb, a Vietnam veteran with three nephews in enlisted ranks,
has been one of the strongest critics.
   ``The elites have excused themselves out of military service
beginning with Vietnam, and it's more so now than when we had a
draft,'' Webb told The Washington Times in a recent interview.
   ``Almost without exception no Washington dinner party guest -
liberal or conservative, Democrat or Republican - personally knows
a single one of the 1.8 million enlisted Americans serving in our
armed forces,'' syndicated columnist Mark Shields wrote recently.
   The Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call, surveying the 535 members
of Congress to find those with children serving in Operation Desert
Shield, found two. Both Rep. Jerry Costello, D-Ill., and Rep. Kika
de la Garza, D-Texas, said they did not know when their sons would
return home. Both also said they have supported President Bush so
far in his deployment of troops.
   Selective Service records show that 1,767,556 young men were
drafted during the Vietnam war, counting from July 1, 1964, through
June 30, 1973. Most went into the Army. In 1966, for instance, the
Army took 366,000 and the Marine Corps, 15,500. Other services
received only a few.
   When the draft was discontinued in 1973, Sens. Sam Nunn of
Georgia and Ernest Hollings of South Carolina protested that the
action could lead to a largely poor, largely minority force.
   Neither Nunn, now chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, nor Hollings could be reached for an interview. Nunn's
press secretary, Scott Williams, said, ``He may have had
reservations back then, but I think he would say now the force is
excellent.''
   Lawrence J. Korb, an assistant secretary of defense for manpower
in the Reagan administration and now a senior fellow with the
Brookings Institution, said, ``Militarily, it is the best force we
have ever had. In terms of equity, it is at least as fair and
probably fairer than the draft you had in Vietnam.''
   ``You forced the lower class to go in whether they wanted to or
not and offered them very little benefits,'' Korb said. ``These
kids were dragged off the street, given a few months training, and
sent over there.''
   Meanwhile, he said, college deferments and other loophles
provided the affluent with ``a system that you could drive a truck
through to get out of service.''
   The Pentagon says recruits now receive an average of a year's
training before joining their units.
   Congressional and Pentagon studies show that blacks are
disproportionately represented among recruits but say the force is
more representative of the population than its critics have
suggested.
   In 1987, almost 20 percent of recruits signing up with the
military for the first time were black, according to a study issued
in October by the Congressional budget office. About 15 percent of
youths of enlistment age are black.
   The study said that about 55 percent of male active-duty
recruits that year came from ZIP code areas where average family
income was in the bottom half nationally.
   ``Lower-middle-income areas were most heavily represented; the
very bottom of the distribution was only slightly
over-represented,'' the study said. ``Areas in the top tenth of the
income distribution provided only about 6 percent of recruits, but
even in the highest-income areas in the country some young people
enlisted.''
   A Defense Department study issued in July gave similar figures,
reporting that 23 percent of the active duty enlisted force in
fiscal year 1989 was black, compared with 12 percent to 14 percent
of civilians of comparable age.
   ``Today, enlisted recruits are not drawn primarily from an
underclass, as they are sometimes thought to be,'' said the report.
``Survey data indicate that the great majority of recruits' parents
are married, own their own homes and are employed.''
   The report said that by a common measurement of socioeconomic
status, the parents of recruits came out nine-tenths as well as a
comparison group of parents of youth in the general population.
   Weinberger dismissed the argument that the force is
unrepresentative as ``absurd and basically imbecilic'' and
``insulting in the highest degree.''
   ``If you really want a definition of a racist,'' he said, ``it
seems to me that the critics of this system are the people who are
the most racist in the country. Are we criticizing the black
population because so many of them want to be in the military?''
   Gen. Colin L. Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
who is black, told The Washington Post recently, ``I don't think
it's disproportionate or wrong. I think it's a choice the American
people made when they said have a volunteer Army and allow those
who want to serve to serve.''

<TEXT>
  The Dow Jones industrial average, which measures
blue-chip performance, is down about 7 percent this year, but the
NASDAQ composite, made up of smaller companies, has fallen nearly
three times that figure.
   So what happened to the so-called small firm effect, which
states that in a period of several years smaller stocks tend to
outpace larger ones? Just wait, say its believers. But we've been
waiting for years, say the doubters.
   Indeed they have. During six of the past seven years the larger
stocks, as measured by the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index, have
outperformed the smaller ones. And between mid-July and
mid-November the little ones plunged 28 percent.
   These figures, from mathematician and investment adviser Gerald
W. Perritt, have tested the faith of many a small-stock investor.
Nothing tests a theory like reality, they say, and the reality has
been very, very poor.
   ``Has the small-firm effect gone the way of the dodo bird?''
asks Perritt in his newsletter, ``Investment Horizon?'' The
question is rhetorical; Perritt, a former professor, is one of the
world's foremost proponents of the theory.
   Briefly, it works on a variety of assumptions, one being that
good smaller companies grow faster than good large ones, in part
because they are managed more entrepreneurially. Their percentage
growth can be much larger than that of big companies. And as they
grow, the investment funds tend to climb aboard.
   ``Little has changed since the effect was discovered in the late
1970s,'' he says. Except, you might say, the recent performance
measurements.
   A realist, Perritt sees even lower prices. With the economy on
the verge of a recession, he says, ``it is likely that the prices
of stocks in general, and small firm stocks in particular, will
head even lower.''
   But, ever faithful to the small-firm thesis, he then sees the
little ones outracing the lumbering giants, for these among other
reasons:
   -The stocks of these companies - equity capitalizations below
$100 million - have suffered from such severe neglect they're
selling at price-earnings multiples not seen since the bottom of
the 1973-1974 recession.
   -While their prices have been hurt, their sales continue to
expand at a rate nearly twice those of companies in the Standard &amp;
Poor's 500-stock index.
   -The January effect. Perritt's research suggests that smaller
stocks have a propensity to deliver large returns during the month
of January. Because of this year's declines, he says, that effect
could be more pronounced than usual.
   -Small-company stock prices tend to soar during the year or two
following a severe recession-induced bear market.
   -Brokers and independent security analysts are beginning to
recommend purchase of solid, small-capitalization stocks to their
clients.
   He believes that once the bear market has run its course -
probably bringing even lower prices to some of the small-cap stocks
- buyers will begin to accumulate shares.
   And, he concludes, given the lack of liquidity in this sector of
the market, ``A marginal increase in buying interest will send the
prices of these stocks soaring.''
   No, says Perritt again, the small-firm effect isn't defunct like
the dodo bird. More like the phoenix rising from the ashes, he
says.

<DATELINE>WINTERTHUR, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The people who run Winterthur Museum
feel the nation's premier collection of American furniture and
decorative arts hasn't gotten the audience it deserves - and they
blame the institution itself.
   They say the sheer size of the immense collection and the
imposing surroundings of a former Du Pont manor are intimidating to
many people. The nine-story, 150-year-old country house, set on a
985-acre estate, contains 89,000 pieces displayed in 196 period
room settings.
   Museum-goers also have been encouraged to make advance
reservations for tours of the collection, and for most of its 39
years Winterthur never tried to reach out for a broad audience.
   The museum's directors began changing direction in the
mid-1980s. They're stressing programs for children to attract more
families, and they're planning a new hall to house a smaller, more
digestible exhibition of the musuem's Americana pieces.
   Why the new approach?
   ``Because it wasn't felt it was necessary,'' said Thomas A.
Graves Jr., the museum's executive director. ``It was perfectly all
right to kep Winterthur exactly the way it was, which was
wonderful.
   ``The collection itself is absolutely extraordinary. But we, the
trustees, felt the time had come that in order for us to really
thrive and be of service in the future, we were going to have to
open up and expand.''
   The changes have meant Winterthur had to join its museum
brethern in fund raising, seeking aggressively for the first time
to tap revenue sources like corporations and federal and private
grants.
   The changes also meant being more businesslike.
   Graves, 66, who was hired in 1985 after 14 years as president of
the College of William and Mary in Virginia, said Winterthur lacked
``normal business management practices and controls on spending.''
   ``Winterthur was not in trouble (financially), but it was clear
we didn't have good control over our costs, personnel and security.
We were just sort of here. We had to establish ourselves as a
first-rate business enterprise if we're going to be first-rate in
the future,'' Graves said.
   Before it started fund raising, Winterthur operated comfortably
off the income from its $150 million endowment left by its founder,
the late Henry Francis du Pont, which made it one of the richest
museums in the country.
   The endowment now generates about $7.1 million in income a year,
providing about 54 percent of the museum's $13 million operating
budget.
   Winterthur's first fund-raising campaign started in December
1988, seeking to raise $19 million for the new exhibition hall.
About $12.3 million has been raised so far, and the building is
scheduled to open in the spring of 1992.
   The new hall will be a traditional museum, where objects are
displayed as if in an art gallery.
   ``This is an extraordinary place, and when you have this kind of
a treasure, I think we have an obligation to share it with as many
people and families as we possibly can. And that's what we're in
the process of doing,'' Graves said.
   A $450,000 grant came from McDonald's for the hall to house an
expanded version of the museum's ``touch it'' room for children.
The exhibit lets kids dress up in old clothes and pick up and
examine objects from the collection.
   In an effort to make itself better known, the museum has sent
its catalog to 8 million people and it recently began participating
in furniture trade shows, displaying reproductions of its
collection. It also opened a store Sept. 22 in Alexandria, Va., to
sell reproductions from the collection.
   ``We've been doing a lot of promotions with groups specifically,
and we've been doing a lot of internal staff training - sensitivity
training to realize that we need to be very aware of what our
visitors know and don't know'' about decorative arts, said Peter H.
Hammell, director of museum and public programs.
   He said the effort is paying off in higher attendance. In the
first 10 months of the year, 132,340 people had visited Winterthur
for tours and special programs, an increase of 16 percent from the
same period last year.
   ``What we're seeing, I hope, is people will give us a chance.
It's a whole changing of our image in the community,'' Hammell
said.
   The move to make Winterthur more accessible is part of a
national trend, said Edward H. Able, executive director of the
American Associaton of Museums in Washington.
   Museums are serving broader populations and hiring culturally
diverse staffs and boards. Museums are ``making sure exhibitions
are understandable to and enjoyable by wider populations,'' Able
said.
   Marvin D. Schwartz, a lecturer at the Metropolitan Museum of Art
in New York, said Winterthur's collection is unrivaled.
   The American wing at the Met and the collection at the Museum of
Fine Arts in Boston have ``some wonderful objects, but I don't
think it is quite as varied'' as Winterthur's, he said.
   ``A number of other museums have American rooms and American
sections, but no place but Winterthur has it all.''

<BYLINE>By LYNNE BERNSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Duran Duran? Where did they go? Did they leave
Planet Earth?
   No. They're globetrotting - New York, Los Angeles, Toronto,
Singapore, Malaysia - to promote ``Liberty,'' their latest and
first album as a new fivesome. Joining the 10-year veteran members
- Simon Le Bon, John Taylor and Nick Rhodes - are guitarist Warren
Cuccurullo and drummer Sterling Campbell.
   In a recent interview, the band was as eager to talk as the
teen-age girls waiting outside the hotel were to meet them.
   Aside from the title, ``Liberty'' has no concept musically or
lyrically. But Le Bon believes it's a statement of Duran Duran's
new identity. With the extra input from Campbell and Cuccurullo,
the band has been energized.
   ``We don't feel confined, which is relevant to the album,'' said
Le Bon. ``I think that's why we call it Liberty.''
   He adds, however, that Duran Duran is not trying to repackage
themselves. They remain similarly true to their ``unique modern
rock'' musical style and disjointed lyrical imagery.
   With the departure of original band members Roger Taylor and
Andy Taylor five years ago (none of the Taylors are related), Duran
Duran went through an identity crisis. John Taylor and Andy Taylor
splintered off to join The Power Station with Robert Palmer, while
Le Bon, Rhodes and Roger Taylor formed Arcadia. About a year later,
Le Bon, Rhodes and Jhn Taylor regrouped after learning they didn't
want to do separate projects.
   Le Bon summed up their realization: ``I wanted to do things that
I could do in Arcadia and Power Station, but I want to do them in
Duran Duran. This is better than anything we can do ourselves.''
   The three continued to produce albums as Duran Duran, touring
with temporary musicians.
   ``We weren't in any hurry to replace Andy and Roger permanently
purely for the reason we knew the chemistry had to be right,'' said
Rhodes who plays keyboards.
   Along came Cuccurullo's tape in 1986 and a note saying ``I'm
your new guitarist.'' The core members liked what they heard and
took him on for the ``Notorious'' tour, keeping him as a permanent
member thereafter. Cuccurullo knew it was meant to be even sooner.
   ``I always thought that if I had been in Birmingham in 1978 and
went to the audition, I would've been in their band,'' said
Cuccurullo who grew up in Brooklyn. He has played with Frank Zappa
and formed Missing Persons.
   Campbell had been playing with Cyndi Lauper and the band So
before being introduced to Duran Duran around 1989. The drummer
joined them for the ``Big Thing'' tour, and when that was over,
they knew ``this was the way it should be.''
   Le Bon described their spontaneous musical process in the
studio: ``It's like a jungle of sound and the best idea is the
strongest and the one that grows the tallest. And everything starts
to naturally spiral around that.''
   Since the British band's explosion into the music and music
television scene 10 years ago, Duran Duran has made eight albums,
producing hit songs such as ``Planet Earth,'' ``Rio,'' ``Hungry
Like the Wolf'' and ``Reflex.'' Their theme song to James Bond's
movie ``A View to a Kill,'' was the first Bond theme to top the
charts.
   The group's first song release off ``Liberty,'' was ``Violence
of Summer.'' The second song released was ``Serious.''
   With all their creative juices flowing, Duran Duran said the
time isn't right for a tour. They're anxious to get back to the
studio by the end of the year to work on another album.
   ``I was just listening to a tape the other day, and in a
two-hour period of music I heard eight different separate song
ideas that came from Warren's,'' said Taylor, ``and three of them
turned into songs on the album.''
   ``I always thought I'd be in a band with Joey, Billy and Vinnie
and all these guys I played with in Brooklyn,'' said Cuccurullo.
``That was all that mattered to us was that group. We didn't want
to go to school. We just wanted to do gigs and play and write songs
and do Stones covers.''

<HEAD>Row Over Bronte Parsonage Reaches `Wuthering Heights'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JESSICA BALDWIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HAWORTH, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mossy gloom of the graveyard, the
wild beauty of the moor beyond, recall the village Charlotte Bronte
described as ``such a lonely spot, buried away from the world.''
   The view from the parsonage parlor where Anne, Emily and
Charlotte wrote their books by candlelight is as somber as ever.
But down the path, past the Black Bull pub where their brother,
Branwell, sought nightly oblivion, is a street for other times.
   The steep thoroughfare is a succession of garish temptations -
postcards, Yorkshire fudge, the Jane Aire hairdressers, the Bronte
Bookshop - for the 200,000 visitors who come every year to visit
the parsonage and tread the moor forever associated with
``Wuthering Heights.''
   Simply by their numbers, pilgrims are damaging the house and its
contents, including the Brontes' cradle, the sofa on which Emily
died and Charlotte's tiny shoes and mitts.
   The Bronte Society has proposed building an extension to the
parsonage to cope with the crowds, and purists are aghast.
   ``People in America and Australia save up for a lifetime to
visit here and they will find it very distressing to come all this
way and find an enormous center which has completely lost its
atmosphere,'' says Chris Sumner, membership chairman of the Bronte
Society.
   The Society's plans, she feels, would destroy ``the tranquility
and the dignity'' of the parsonage.
   Sheltered in her parsonage office from the icy wind and
threatening clouds blowing across the moor, Jane Sellars, curator
of the Bronte Parsonage Museum, said recently that the choice is
between building an extension or closing the house to visitors.
   ``It is the fabric of the house and the objects in it that we
are concerned about. The visitors affect the environment in which
we keep irreplaceable objects. The objectors have an emotional
response that does not understand that a museum has to be
accessible to people,'' Sellars said.
   Robert Barnard, a Bronte Society member, complains that the
addition would ``dwarf the parsonage and make it a minor component
in a Bronte theme park.''
   ``And secondly, the style of the building is hideously out of
tune with a late Georgian house. I call it neo-Norman fortress
style with its little round windows that look like you're going to
pour boiling oil out of them,'' Barnard said in an interview.
   Opponents say the extension will cut off the parsonage from the
starkly beautiful Yorkshire moors, where the sisters found
inspiration on walks over the stubbly heather in their long, narrow
shoes.
   Sellars said the extension would improve the flow of visitors
through the house, and provide better control of the temperature
and humidity.
   ``Traffic clogs to a halt and some furniture is getting brushed
against which should really be screened off,'' she said.
   Barnard says the extension is no answer to the problem of wear
and tear inside the parsonage. ``You still have the same number of
rooms,'' he said.
   The architect's plans for the $2.5 million extension would not
change the frontal view of the parsonage. There would be space for
an enlarged Bronte family history exhibition, a meeting room and an
area for scholars.
   Sellars said the more than 200 Bronte scholars who come each
year to study the primary sources and manuscripts have to work
inside the museum's small library alongside the society's two
librarians and their computers and telephones.
   ``The Bronte Society is a literary society that should be a
learned society,'' she said. ``The visitors are just shunted
through the house and then moved on, we should be teaching more
about the literature and the place.''
   The extension, if approved by the Bradford County Council, would
be built of grit stone and in the vernacular style of the village.
``It's not like we're going to put up a steel-mass skyscraper,''
Sellars said.
   Opponents have suggested building an addition some distance from
the parsonage, which became a museum in 1928, or even underground.
   ``Bronte enthusiasts can take a bit of bad weather; we can walk
outside to get to our meeting room,'' Barnard said.
   Michael Steed, chairman of the 3,240-member Bronte Society, said
the underground addition had not been considered. ``I find it hard
to believe that visitors coming to Haworth would find going into an
underground museum at all attractive.''
   Barnard said the publicity-shy Brontes, who wrote under
pseudonyms, would have loathed the row over the parsonage. Indeed,
``they would have hated the whole business of people tromping
through their house. Because in Charlotte's time they did come to
Haworth and gawk at where the author of `Jane Eyre' lived.''
   Charlotte wrote three other novels and left a fourth unfinished.
Born in 1816, she died in 1855 is buried in the church opposite the
parsonage beside Emily (1818-1848), who wrote ``Wuthering
Heights.''
   Anne (1820-1849) author of ``Agnes Grey'' and ``The Tenant of
Wildfell Hall'' is buried far away in the coastal town of
Scarborough where she died.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A United States senator was shouting
accusations at Robert S. Bennett when the special ethics counsel
began to fidget in his black swivel chair.
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini was good and mad, gesturing vividly while
he complained that Bennett was out to get him and the other
so-called Keating Five.
   Bennett squirmed in his seat while DeConcini hurled accusations:
Bennett was personally trying to write new standards of conduct for
the Senate. Bennett was no longer a independent investigator, but a
prosecutor who wanted the five senators as a trophy.
   Finally, the senator sat down. The Senate Ethics Committee
hearing room was quiet as the stocky attorney rose to speak in
rebuttal.
   ``These are not my standards,'' Bennett said, speaking directly
to the committee with a forceful voice but not hurrying his words.
``And just because you can't go to the Government Printing Office
and say, `Hey, give me the ethical standard that covers all
situations' doesn't mean they don't exist. Gentlemen, you're a lot
better than that.''
   While many lawyers hired by Congress to conduct a highly visible
investigation may show great reverence to U.S. senators, Bennett is
not one of them. He is not intimidated by the committee members who
hired him or the lawmakers he was brought in to investigate.
   Bennett, 51, is known for his straightforward - even blunt -
speech.
   ``He is a no-nonsense litigator who has a way of getting across
to a whole spectrum of different people,'' said Peter P. Mullen,
executive partner of the 1,100-lawyer, New York-based firm of
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom - which hired Bennett this
year. ``He can talk to princes and paupers, kings and the
homeless.''
   Bennett's expertise is in defending businessmen accused of white
collar crimes. Mullen said his firm scoured the country before
hiring him to head its white collar practice. By the time the deal
was completed, Bennett had brought along, from his former firm, 14
other lawyers, three legal assistants and four secretaries.
   The Ethics Committee also could point to Bennett's experience
when he was hired a year ago to investigate Sens. DeConcini,
D-Ariz.; John McCain, R-Ariz.; Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich.; John
Glenn, D-Ohio and Alan Cranston, D-Calif. The five intervened with
thrift regulators on behalf of former S&amp;L owner Charles H. Keating
Jr., a political contributor.
   Bennett was special counsel in the investigation of Sen. Dave
Durenberger, R-Minn., who the Senate denounced earlier this year
for financial misconduct.
   And he performed the same role in the case of former Sen.
Harrison A. Williams Jr., D-N.J., who quit the Senate in 1982 just
as the chamber was about to expel him for bribery.
   Bennett's response to DeConcini in the opening days of the
ongoing ethics committee hearing told a lot about himself.
   He told the committee the only trophy he wanted was the one he
already had in the wall of his office, which also has a panoramic
view of the Washington Monument and environs.
   The trophy is a stuffed, 5-pound, 2-ounce brown trout he caught
in 1985. Underneath the fish is a saying that Bennett shows clients
in hopes they'll heed the advice: ``If I had kept my mouth shut, I
wouldn't be here.''
   And he reminded the committee that many Senate standards of
conduct were not written by him but by former Sen. Paul Douglas of
Illinois in 1951 - when Bennett was growing up in Brooklyn and only
interested in the Dodgers.
   Bennett's rebuttal also mentioned his three teenage daughters,
to make the point that even the school they attended has standards
of conduct.
   ``Whenever I have a case I feel is important, I always work my
daughters in,'' Bennett said later. ``It's just something to make
them feel good, to let them know I'm thinking about them.''
   Sitting in his office for an interview, Bennett - remembered
that he may be focused on his work now, but once was more
interested in cutting school to watch games at old Ebbitts Field.
   ``One day I was yelling `Come on Pee Wee (Reese) and I felt a
hand on my shoulder. It was my father,'' Bennett said, who had been
tipped off by a friend that his son was at the ballpark.
   Bennett's father, a banker officer, expressed his displeasure
that day. But now, Bennett says, ``I have one request for this
story. Mention my father. F. Robert Bennett.''
   Bennett is not the only high-profile member of his family.
Younger brother William is incoming chairman of the Republican
National Committee, formerly the national drug czar and a secretary
of education. Robert Bennett, though, says he's strictly
non-political.
   A favorite hobby is fishing for brown trout in Montana and a
year ago, Bennett bought a home near Livingston, along the
Yellowstone River.
   ``Bob is a good spin fisherman, but now he's trying to become a
good fly fisherman,'' said Bennett's pal Lenny Gregrey, of
Livingston, a retired New York City police lieutenant.
   ``His only frustration is he can't tie knots. His fingers won't
work. I gave him a written test and he got all flustered,'' Gregrey
said of his usually unflappable friend.
   ``He was sweating over the questions.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE - Fifty years ago Adolf Hitler decided to take his
biggest gamble of World War II, the invasion of the Soviet Union.
It was an action that helped lead to the collapse of the Third
Reich and left the Soviet Union in control of Eastern Europe all
the way to the Elbe River in central Germany. Here's a
retrospective on what was going on in Berlin and Moscow during
those crucial months before the invasion.

   Warped by furies as twisted as his swastika, Adolf Hitler on
Dec. 18, 1940, signed Directive 21.
   It was topmost secret. Only nine copies were issued.
   At first it had been innocently codenamed ``Fritz.'' Then AUFBAU
OST -Buildup East. Finally, Case Barbarossa.
   Barbarossa - Red Beard - was the nickname of Frederick I, a Holy
Roman Emperor who drowned in 1190 leading the Third Crusade. A folk
myth grew up. Frederick was actually in seclusion in a cave on
Kyffhauser Mountain in central Germany. Some day he would emerge to
lead a German conquest of Europe.
   Case Barbarossa was Hitler's equivalent: the invasion of the
Soviet Union. It was, in retrospect, a mad gamble. It guaranteed
that Germany would have to fight on two fronts, a burden that in
due course crushed Hitler's Third Reich.
   Barbarossa ultimately also spawned another war, the cold one.
Europe became encased in an Iron Curtain as Soviet armies repulsed
Hitler's invasion and drove his Wehrmacht westward to its
destruction. One menace bequeathed the battleground to another, the
Soviet Union.
   After postponements, Barbarossa was scheduled for June 22, 1941.
Napoleon commenced his disastrous invasion of Russia on the same
day 129 years before. Hitler knew the lesson well. Had he lost his
senses?
   One of Hitler's biographers, Alan Bullock, has written ``The
passions which ruled his mind were ignoble: hatred, resentment, the
lust for dominance and, where he could not dominate, to destroy. .
.. His dictatorship was barren of all ideas save one - the further
extension of his own power and that of the nation with which he
identified ... to sustain the role of the `master race' over the
degraded subject peoples of his new empire in the east. ...''
   In his political testament, ``Mein Kampf,'' Hitler wrote in
1924: ``If we talk about the new soil and territory in Europe
today, we can think primarily only of Russia and its vassal border
states. ... The giant empire in the East is ready for collapse. And
the end of the Jewish rule in Russia will also be the end of Russia
as a state.''
   Deeds matched words. The year he became chancellor, 1933, Hitler
halted joint, clandestine training and rearmament with the Soviet
Union. In 1936, Germany signed a pact with Japan against the
Comintern, Marxism's international arm headed by Josef Stalin's
Soviet Union. The next year he told his generals: ``The German
people have a right to greater living space than other peoples.''
Eventually they would have to fight Britain, France and the Soviet
Union to get it.
   But on Aug. 23, 1939, foreign ministers Vyacheslav Molotov and
Joachim von Ribbentrop signed the Russian-German Non-Aggression
Pact, one of the most stunning flip-flops in modern history. Two
avowed mortal enemies were suddenly in bed together.
   The stolid, expressionless Molotov explained to the Supreme
Soviet: ``The political art in foreign affairs ... is to turn
yesterday's enemies into good neighbors. ... The Soviet Union and
Germany were enemies. The situation is now changed, and we have
stopped being enemies.''
   Hardly. Stalin's murderous purges of the Soviet army officer
corps in 1937 had bled it white. He was left playing for time to
rearm. By joining Hitler's invasion of Poland, which touched off
World War II, he was also pushing Russia's frontier 200 miles to
the west. The Soviet dictator was also deeply suspicious that
capitalist Britain and France wanted the Soviet Union to exhaust
itself and Germany in a war. Then they could deal with both.
   To the man in the street in Moscow, wrote journalist Alexander
Werth, the consensus was that ``it was nasty and unpleasant to have
to pretend to make friends with Hitler, but as things were in 1939
we had to gain time at any price. We thought that war with France
would last a long time and Germany would be greatly weakened.
Selfish? Well, yes, but who isn't?''
   Hitler told his propaganda people to airbrush out Stalin's
cigarette in photos of the pact signing. He would temporarily
tolerate Uncle Joe but never smoking. Privately he said:
``Everything I have in mind is directed against Russia; if the West
is too stupid to understand this, then I will be forced to come to
terms with Russia to crush the West and then ... turn with all my
forces against the Soviet Union.''
   In June 1940, even as his panzers were still rolling through
France - and the Soviets had invaded the Baltic states - Hitler
ordered planning for a Soviet campaign to begin.
   The task was assigned to Col. Bernhard von Lossberg. His plan
ran to 30 pages and was codenamed ``Fritz'' for his son. It was
predicated on an offensive in 1941 before Germans began
complacently enjoying the fruits of their astonishing victories.
And before Britain had been subdued.

   Said Hitler: ``Of course the people will never see the point of
this new campaign ... (They) must always be led by the nose to
paradise. ... We cannot keep up this level of armament much longer.
... It is why we have to use force now, because one day the
countless millions of Slavs are going to come. Perhaps not even in
10 years time, perhaps only after a hundred, but they will come.''
   Two months later, Hitler's staff began laying out a remote
headquarters in East Prussia.
   Hitler's army commander, Walter von Brauchitsch, confidently
predicted only a mopping-up operation would remain after a major
battle of ``up to four weeks.'' Alfred Jodl, another of Hitler's
``yes'' generals, said: ``The Russian colossus will prove to be a
pig's bladder. Prick it and it will burst.''
   The general staff was so confident that only one soldier in five
was issued winter clothing. Napoleon made the same mistake.
   Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, Hitler's chief of staff, had
doubts about a two-front war but kept silent. He paid for his
loyalty, as did Jodl, with his life. Before his execution at
Nuremberg, Keitel wrote: ``(Hitler) wrongly assessed the reserves
of Bolshevism and the Soviet state, and it was thus he brought
about the ruin of himself and the Third Reich he had created.''
   Gen. Heinz Guderian, Hitler's brilliant tank commander in
France, had few illusions: ``So long as war in the West was
undecided, any new undertaking must result in war on two fronts;
and Adolf Hitler's Germany was even less capable of fighting such a
war than had been the Germany of 1914.''
   Hitler was not totally blinded by his monomania. ``I had always
maintained that we ought at all costs to avoid war on two fronts,''
he confided to his aide Martin Bormann, ``And you may rest assured
that I pondered long and hard over Napoleon's experience in Russia.
Why, then, may you ask, why this war against Russia?''
   There was no hope of ending the war by an invasion of Britain
with the United States playing an increasingly aggressive role.
Time was on Russia's side. Strike sooner than later.
   Directive 21 stressed that victory must be achieved quickly.
``We have only to kick in the door and the whole rotten structure
will come crashing down. ... When Barbarossa begins, the world will
hold its breath.''
   As the months passed, Hitler seemed to adopt the fatalism of a
gambling addict who sees no alternative to putting everything on
the turn of a card. ``If it fails, then it will all be over anyway.
If it succeeds, it will ... probably force Britain to make peace.''
   In any event, said the former World War I corporal, ``I do not
expect my generals to understand me; but I shall expect them to
obey my orders.''
   Stalin was also gambling. For time. His actions in the seven
months before Barbarossa seem inscrutable, even incomprehensible.
Barbarossa was not Pearl Harbor. Stalin had repeated warnings from
multiple directions.
   In November 1940 he was concerned about German troop movements
in Romania and Finland. (The Soviets had already seized part of the
former and were about to invade the latter.) Stalin sent Molotov
and an entourage to Berlin to protest.
   Ribbentrop, the German foreign minister, as bubbly headed as the
champagne he used to sell, blithely offered the Soviets partnership
in the Germany-Italy-Japan Axis. This could satisfy the Soviet
Union's historic quest for a warm water seaport.
   ``Which sea?'' asked the blunt Molotov. Ribbentrop airily
offered the Persian Gulf or perhaps the Indian Ocean. Molotov
wanted a base in Denmark, deep in Germany's Baltic flank.
   Ribbentrop pressed his plan on Molotov in an air-raid shelter
when a diplomatic dinner was adjourned underground due to British
bombers. Britain was defeated, said the German foreign minister,
and her empire would be there for Russia's taking.
   ``If that is so, why are we in this shelter and whose are those
bombs which fall?'' Molotov deadpanned.
   Moscow subsequently agreed to join the Axis. Hitler never even
replied to the offer. German troops were concentrating in the East,
he said, to protect vital interests in Romanian oil and Swedish
iron ore, which was true enough as far as it went.
   But Barbarossa's intent was far more Hitlerian. ``The war
against Russia,'' he ordered, ``cannot be fought in a knightly
fashion. This struggle is one of ideologies and racial differences
and will have to be conducted with unprecedented, merciless and
unrelenting harshness.''
   Special Action Groups - Einsatzgruppen - were formed to
``cleanse'' occupied territory of Jews and other objectionables.
   In February 1941 the British ambassador to Moscow warned of a
German attack set for June. The source, not revealed, was Ultra,
Britain's masterful cracking of the code machine Germany thought
invulnerable. The president of the Skoda Works in Czechoslovakia, a
Soviet informant, told Moscow he had been ordered to increase
armament production for an invasion in June.
   Stalin, who trusted no one and suspected Winston Churchill was
plotting to draw Russia into the war to ``save her chestnuts from
the fire,'' reacted: ``This information is English provocation.
Find out who is making this provocation and punish him.''
   Several times, the Soviet's master spy in Tokyo, German
journalist Richard Sorge, warned of a June invasion.
   Even a modestly alert espionage ring - and Russia had a good one
in the Red Orchestra (Rote Kapelle) of communist sympathizers in
Germany - would have noted the signs. Germany was requisitioning
farm horses. East Prussian farmers along the Soviet border had been
ordered not to plant spring crops. By April 1941 there had been 80
violations of Soviet air space. A German camera plane had made a
forced landing 100 miles inside the Soviet Union.

   Only days after Hitler ordered Directive 21 into effect, the
Soviet military attache in Berlin was anonymously given a summary
of Barbarossa. On April 19, 1941, Churchill, based on Ultra,
personaly warned Stalin. Mystifyingly, the Soviets reported several
of these tips to Berlin so Hitler wouldn't become suspicious that
they were dealing under the table with the British.
   Was Stalin irrational or an ostrich burying his head in the
sand? Current analysis is that he was neither. He, too, knew his
Napoleon. Warned by the Yugoslav ambassador on April 6, 1941, of an
invasion by Hitler, Stalin replied, ``Let him try it.''
   But the rout of the French in only six weeks, the attacks by
Japan on the Soviet Union's Asian front, left him skittish. Yet he
could not bring himself to trust capitalist Britain and its
tough-talking Churchill. Nor could Churchill, standing alone
against Hitler, entirely trust him.
   Marshal A.I. Yeremenko writes in his memoirs that Stalin
``failed to authorize defense measures ... to avoid provoking
Hitler before the Soviet army was fully armed. ... His own hope was
for the capitalists and the Nazis to destroy each other. .. .''
   On April 3, 1941, Stalin signed a non-aggression pact with
Japan. Drunk, he saw the Japanese off at the Moscow train station
and embraced the German military attache as well, saying, ``Of
course we're going to remain friends, won't we?''
   As proof, the Soviet Union inexplicably honored its trade
agreement with Germany, shipping 2 million tons of oil and 1.5
million tons of grain to the nation poised to attack it. Germany
was meant to repay with manufactured goods. ``Unavoidable delays''
kept this traffic to a minimum. (Scarcely three hours before the
B-Tag - Barbarossa Day - offensive began June 22 at 3 a.m., the
frontier was opened for the Moscow-Berlin express train. Right
behind it was a long freight of grain for Germany.)
   On June 14, Sorge radioed Moscow: ``War begins June 22.'' Tass,
the Soviet news agency, was nonetheless ordered to refute war
rumors as ``clumsy propaganda by forces hostile to the U.S.S.R.''
   On June 18, a German soldier fearing a court-martial for
striking an officer deserted across the border and gave the Soviets
the invasion timetable. ``No use getting into a panic about such
nonsense,'' said the local commander.
   Stalin met with his generals on the eve of the attack but
declined to issue an alert. Barton Whaley in his book ``Codeword
BARBAROSSA'' surmises that Stalin believed that any German invasion
would be preceded by an ultimatum and none had been given.
   He may also have been lulled by ingenious and plausible German
disinformation. Hitler's devious propagandist, Joseph Goebbels,
leaked word that rumors of an invasion were really a cover for an
upcoming invasion of England.
   Whaley says Stalin was ``partly deafened to the authentic
signals of doom.''
   Thus when another German deserter June 21 got word to Gen.
Dmitri Pavlov, Minsk area commander, that invasion was only hours
away, Pavlov shrugged: ``Seems rubbish to me.''
   More than 1,300 Soviet planes were destroyed on the ground when
the blitzkreig struck.
   Barbarossa was, like Waterloo, a very near thing. Initial Soviet
losses were appalling. While the two opoponents' armies were about
equal in manpower, the Germans had their panzers. But while each
such division had 3,300 vehicles, only 300 were tracked. And tracks
were essential to carry the assault forward across the muddy fields
of roadless, peasant Russia.
   The barbaric slaughter of civilians by the Einsatzgruppen cost
Hitler the support he could well have found among the
independent-minded Ukrainians and Byelorussians. Germany's invasion
of Yugoslavia and Greece in March and April had also caused
Barbarossa to be delayed a month. That loss of time gave Stalin a
life-saving reprieve as the worst winter on record froze Barbarossa
in its tracks.
   Barbarossa, of course, ultimately failed. Its collapse left the
Soviet Union astride Eastern Europe all the way to the Elbe in
central Germany. From that bastion the U.S.S.R. was to challenge
the West for almost half a century until the Berlin Wall fell a
year ago.

   Remembrances of the German invasion of the Soviet
Union nearly 50 years ago still evoke strong emotions despite the
end of the Cold War.
   The invasion came on June 22, 1941, beginning a siege that cost
20 million Soviet lives.
   And with the reunification of the two Germanys this year, many
Soviets fear Germany will again become an aggressor.
   At this year's celebration of Victory Day marking the defeat of
Adolf Hitler in 1945, veterans of World War II were skeptical that
the former enemy could be trusted.
   ``Unification is good, but there must be a guarantee of the
security of all people, especially those who suffered the most from
Hitler,'' said Col. Vasily Kovalev, 63. ``It's in the center of
Europe, so it must be a peaceful country.''
   Lt. Col. Konstantin Palkin, another veteran, said, ``I'm
skeptical. I don't exclude the possibility of German revenge.''
But, he added, Soviet World War II allies would not allow that.
   Another veteran, a senior navy officer who declined to give his
name, was repulsed by a unified Germany. ``I killed Germans then,
and if I have to I'll kill them again.''
   Before Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power in 1985, horror
stories of the Great Patriotic War were daily fodder for
newspapers, television and movie documentaries. The perils of war
were hammered home in lessons given to schoolchildren and the Cold
War thrived on the threat of another global conflict.
   Even with the end of the Cold War, talk of Germany and
reunification draws strong responses from Soviets, most of whom
lost at least one family member in the war.
   Vadim Biryukov, editor of the magazine Business in the U.S.S.R.,
tells of watching a television report of German war veterans
sending gifts to Soviet veterans.
   ``Everything is twisted,'' Biryukov says. ``I have never seen
anything more disgusting. It makes me very emotional that German
veterans can give presents to our veterans, but our government
cannot afford to.''
   But with reunification, he said, World War II has finally become
part of history.
   ``All this period when Germany was divided into two countries,
this experiment, is over,'' he said. ``It proved that the system
offered as a result of World War II failed completely.''
   New Times, a weekly magazine, said fears raised by the new
Germany were largely groundless.
   Although most war veterans have misgivings, the magazine said,
there are no legitimate motives for Germany to attack anyone. The
social conditions of the 1930s no longer exist and as far as
economic gains were concerned, ``German businessmen have long
understood that this can be done in a way different from the one
offered them by Hitler.''
   One of the ironies emerging from the end of the Cold War is
economic aid from a wealthy Germany to an impoverished Soviet
Union.
   But, said Biryukov, such aid was logical and had to be accepted.
   ``After all, one country is poor, the other is not so poor,'' he
said. ``It proves that the human race is human after all.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE - For the past year, since the fall of the Berlin
Wall, tourists have been rediscovering an older, more traditional
Europe to the east. A reporter who recently took a cruise on the
Black Sea from Bulgaria to the Soviet Crimea found a certain charm
amid the chaos of a changing economy.

   There's a small hotel - in fact, there
are hundreds of them that only a year ago were private villas and
holiday retreats for Communist commissars, privileged artists and
favored trade union leaders.
   Now the vacancy sign is out for tourists from the West, or the
Far East, since the yen is as welcome as the dollar, the pound and
the mark. But, please, no levs - the locals disdain the local
currency.
   And the high-rise Communist Party House, as much a fixture in
every Bulgarian city and town as the hulking statue of Lenin, now
has offices to rent to shipping firms, travel agents, exporters and
all kinds of entrepreneurs pouring into Eastern Europe since the
fall of the Berlin Wall.
   ``This is no longer a communist country; we are a developing
democracy,'' says Dmitri, our guide from Balkantourist, the state
travel agency, as he leads a band of tourists off a cruise ship
through the ruins of Roman baths. In the second century, Varna,
then called Odessos, was a rest center for the Roman emperors'
legionnaires.
   A little later he leads us up a precarious trail to a
cliff-hanging medieval monastery called Aladja.
   Suddenly last summer, all over Eastern Europe, monasteries and
churches and palaces that had been held in ideological scorn for
half a century came back in favor. Those that had been used to
store grain or billet troops, or had been converted to museums of
atheism, were being swept out and refurbished.
   And in beach resorts all along the Black Sea coast from
Bulgaria's Turkish border to the Soviet Crimea, dreary high-rise
hotels in stolid Stalinist gothic are scheduled for
``privatization.''
   Ibusz, the Hungarian state tourist agency, is on the block to
raise capital to launch capitalism. Dresden is trying to unload
from its main square a 22-foot-high head of Karl Marx, but so far
has found no takers.
   German golfer Bernhard Langer, the 1985 Masters champion, is
prospecting for future course layouts in Hungary, Czechoslovakia
and what was East Germany. The royal and ancient game, banned for
decades in communist climes, already is in full back-swing on an
island 21 miles up the Danube from Budapest at a 9-hole course
named ``Szentendre'' - St. Andrews.
   ``Here in Varna,'' Dmitri says, ``we already have a German beer
garden, an English pub, a Greek taverna and an Indian restaurant.
We think many tourists will be coming. Our climate is much milder
than the French Riviera. You can swim until mid-October.''
   On a balmy fall day several bathers were slithering down water
slides and landing splat in mud baths along the wide beach called
Zlatri Piassatsi - Golden Sands.
   Hoping to match neighboring Romania's oil finds, drillers gushed
up only mineral springs here. Some Austrian tourists happened by
after World War II and insisted the waters cured rheumatism and
baldness. A spa was born.
   Shepherding his flock into a shopping arcade where some lace,
embroidery and leathercraft were displayed, Dmitri expresses the
hope that Bulgaria's younger generation will ``hang in there'' (his
newest English idiom) long enough to reap the rewards of a
free-market economy.
   ``More than 100,000 left the country last year,'' he says. ``A
million more may go next year.''
   Outside, a young man was peddling ``rare icons'' that stained
his jacket with their fresh coat of gilt.
   In a square near the Ethnographic Museum, the proprietor of a
little van advertising ``beer, herring and brandy'' gave a sadder
picture of the inflated local currency. He had no beer and no
herring, but a plastic cup of slivova, strong plum brandy, netted
you change from a one-lev note, valued at 14 cents.
   Arriving at Yalta in the Crimea, the cruise passengers wondered
about the future of the 80 health resorts and sanitaria operated by
various trade unions and government agencies. Nestled in the pine
forests on the bluffs were villas and dachas of top-level
commissars and apparatchniki.
   Our Intourist guide worried a little about privatization since
individual Soviet republics now have been given control of their
own tourism. But she doubts that foreign visitors will ever take
over what she called ``the comrades' Coney Island.'' Last year, she
said, 2 million vacationers came to Yalta, adding that ``our local
joke is that they sunbathe standing up.''
   She was eloquent on Yalta's health-giving climate: ``Winds off
the Crimean Mountains filtering through the pine forests mingle
with the Black Sea breezes to produce an atmosphere that has been
scientifically proven to be beneficial in the treatment of stress,
rheumatism, asthma and cardiovascular ailments.''
   Russian playwright and short-story writer Anton Chekhov came for
treatment of the tuberculosis he aggravated walking all night in
the snowy streets of Moscow in despair over poor notices for ``The
Seagull.'' Leo Tolstoy convalesced in a nursing home up on the
bluffs and was read to under the pines by novelist Maxim Gorky.

   In keeping with the new reverence for palaces, we had to don
burlap mukluks to glide across the parquet floors of the Alupka
Palace, the two-faced edifice that Count Vorontsov had his British
architect dream up. It has a Tudor castle facade on the north side
and a ripoff of the Moorish Alhambra overlooking the sea on the
south.
   Leaving the grounds we were besieged by hordes of young black
marketeers flogging caviar, champagne, amber jewelry, Russian army
caps and more ``genuine antique'' icons.
   ``Hey Oncle Sam, you want hero medals?'' called out a boy barely
in his teens, opening his coat like a prohibition bootlegger to
display a lining resplendent with medals, ribbons and decorations.
``No? What about a meel-itary vatch?'' He pushed up his sleeve and
revealed an armload reaching beyond the elbow. ``Maybe you give me
choon-gum or a Marlboro cigarette.''
   Our guide warned against ``pickpockets, money changers who will
give you pre-revolution Ukrainian notes, and similar bad peoples.''
   Since Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev lifted the lid on
communism's pressure cooker all sorts of ``bad peoples'' have
bubbled to the surface in the Soviet Union. Crime has risen nearly
40 per cent. In some larger cities, where burglaries are up 80
percent, the citizens are forming neighborhood crime patrols.
   The police, always despised but now ridiculed and rationed to 5
gallons of gas a day for their patrol cars, keep such a low profile
that highway accidents have increased fourfold.
   Director Vladimir Malinin of Intourist recently reported that
because of the crime situation bookings dropped 40 per cent in
1990, and American visitors were down to 100,000 from 180,000 the
year before.
   Heavy morning fog at Odessa on the northern rim of the Black Sea
delayed the docking of our ship, the Cunard liner Vistaford.
   Because we arrived late ``and the driver is not permitted
overtime,'' our guide vetoed a photo opportunity at the foot of the
famous Potemkin Steps. Twice as wide at the bottom as the top, the
staircase projects a splendid optical illusion of even greater
height than its 455 feet.
   Grigori Potemkin, Catherine the Great's favorite general,
ushered in the golden age of tourism on the Black Sea in
inaugurating the new harbor at Sevastapol in 1797. He floated
foreign dignitaries down the Dnieper on 80 Roman galleys, painted
red and gold, each with its own orchestra.
   Since some of the new towns planned for the Crimea were still on
the drawing board, Potemkin had facades of fake buildings erected
and transported in thousands of peasants to populate his ``Potemkin
villages,'' a sort of Disneyland on the Dnieper.
   Our guide dismissed an enchanting Orthodox cathedral with golden
onion domes as ``not important'' and attempted to hurry us into the
hard-currency Beryozka shop, which sold vodka, fur hats, amber
jewelry and other luxury items available only to foreigners.
   The way was blocked by a very drunken comrade being rushed along
by two friends in almost as bad shape. He teetered from their grasp
and fell on his face in the gutter, blood gushing from his cuts.
   ``Somogan!'' spat out our guide in disgust. The word means
moonshine vodka, a popular black-market item in the wake of
Gorbachev's temperance campaign.
   Saturday evidently was marrying day in Odessa. Dozens of wedding
parties emerged from a government registry office to pose for
pictures on the lawn and under the porticoes of the handsome opera
house, one of Europe's finest.
   The brides in long white gowns, the grooms in formal wear, some
with top hats, arrived in horse-drawn carriages and vintage
limousines, gaily decorated with flowers, streamers and silver
bells.
   Some alighted from taxicabs and the tandem three-car trolleys.
One bride was delivered by an ambulance driven by a friend or
relative. Most bridal couples were in their 30s and beyond.
   ``They marry late because there is a long wait for an apartment,
sometimes 10 years,'' a taxi driver told us. ``Many will move in
with relatives.''
   Downtown Odessa, with its broad boulevards, chestnut trees and
the fading elegance of its hotels, museums, opera house and older
apartments built in czarist baroque, retains the charm of an older
Europe. But that vanishes as one proceeds past the university to
the grim blocks of tower apartments in communist concrete.
   Gradually the clock is being turned back in Odessa. Rival
political parties are beginning to emerge. Proletariat Street has
changed its name back to French Boulevard.
   Before bidding us farewell, the lady from Intourist delivered
one of those stupefying tour-guide statistcs that trouble your
sleep like the rumblings of an underdone blini: ``Unsurpassed in
its curative qualities, the mud of Odessa has long been recognized
as the world standard for mud.''
   East of Berlin, local color is where you find it.

   One of the delights of traveling east of Vienna, Austria, is
encountering the older, traditional Europe.
   For the most part, the cities are safe after dark. The ivers
are all polluted, but the countryside remains unscarred by the
bulldozer and commercial development. Mule-drawn plows are common.
   The pace of life is slower. In a society of guaranteed
employment and subsidized housing, health care and even holidays,
there was no rat race.
   A year ago any contact with foreigners was forbidden. Now people
are eager to practice their rusty English.
   But there is a drabness and a sadness about the people. They
betray a sense of having been left behind, of having missed out on
something in the half-century of totalitarian rule.
   The tourist must not get carried away with the nostalgia
promised in the new travel brochures. ``Old world charm'' can mean
the bathroom is a long way down the hall. ``Unspoiled'' can
translate to never fixed.
   Telephones don't work. Toilets don't work. In many hotels,
neither do the staffers. A system that subsidized idleness and
inefficiency does not convert readily to the concept of
customer-friendly.
   Travelers who have ventured eastward have tales to tell of rats
in closets, beds with fleas, restaurants where you bring your own
bread and the plat du jour is a stew festering with the viscera of
an unidentified animal, and best you don't ask.

   EDITOR'S NOTE - As bright as a sunburst is the face of a child
who discovers how to whistle. But where have all the whistlers
gone? Has whistling a happy tune become a dying art? It seems so,
partly because much of today's music doesn't have a tune you can
pucker up to.

   ``You do know how to whistle, don't you? You just
put your lips together and blow.''
   That was Lauren Bacall's husky parting shot to Humphrey Bogart
in the classic film ``To Have and Have Not.'' But it seems hardly
anybody follows that advice anymore.
   Oh, sure, people whistle. You hear those ear-splitting shrieks
at football games, the shrill blasts that beckon home wandering
pets, the descending note of surprise, the appreciative wolf
whistle.
   But in many parts of the country it's rare to hear somebody
whistling a tune in public. Rarer still to hear it done well.
   ``It's almost a lost art,'' says Bill Taylor of Musician
Magazine in Boston.
   ``It's a throwback to a bygone era,'' adds Harry Lipson, a
Boston folk music promoter.
   Earlier in this century, street-corner whistling simply mirrored
popular music. Top performers - Bing Crosby, Al Jolson, Sammy Davis
Jr., Jack Benny and folk singer Pete Seeger, to name a few -
whistled in their acts, and amateurs picked up the tunes.
   But the only one of that group still living, Seeger, no longer
whistles in performances. ``I haven't heard him do it in years,''
says agent Harold Leventhal.
   Fred Taylor, a Boston jazz promoter, says some artists
occasionally incorporate whistling into their acts. And a few
avant-garde musicians whistle exclusively. ``It's in the novelty
category,'' he says. ``It's a cult.''
   Among the faithful is Brad Terry who discovered his unusual
talent about 25 years ago while standing in a cavernous Manhattan
parking garage.
   Terry, a jazz clarinet player from Brunswick, Maine, had just
finished a jam session. While waiting for an attendant to deliver
his car, he started whistling.
   ``It was extraordinary,'' says Terry. ``It had tremendous
reverberation. There were 25 or 30 people standing on a platform
behind me, and they all started applauding.''
   Not long after that, he tried whistling with a microphone.
``It's been part of the act ever since,'' he says.
   Terry, who has recorded three whistling albums, is among the few
professional practitioners of what appears to be a vanishing art.
   Downbeat Magazine has called Terry ``the finest jazz whistler in
the world.'' Another practitioner is Ron McCroby of Chagrin Falls,
Ohio. An advertising executive by trade, McCroby has recorded jazz
and classical albums and appeared on the ``Tonight'' show.
   Meanwhile, a group of spare-time whistlers has tried for more
than a decade to revive the dying art.
   ``Each of us had noticed that you don't hear whistling
anymore,'' says iimi Drummond of Horsham, Pa., who publishes a
newsletter for the International Whistlers' Association. ``So we
formed the association to promote whistling, especially among
children.''
   The group evolved from a whistling contest sponsored by the
Chamber of Commerce in Carson City, Nev., in 1977.
   About 30 people showed up to that first ``Whistle-Off,'' some
whistling a cappella, some accompanied by piano, guitar, banjo,
washboards, taped music and even live back-up singers.
   Since then, the association's membership has grown to about 200.
They try to gather annually for a Whistle-Off but, as further
evidence of whistling's fading popularity, this year's contest had
to be canceled because they couldn't find a sponsor.
   Hard-core whistlers want to elevate whistling to a serious
musical form. ``We don't do the bird-whistle competition,'' says
Drummond, a national champion who once performed ``The Merry Widow
Waltz'' at a Whistle-Off.
   At the same time, whistlers want to preserve the light-hearted
spirit that prompted them to whistle, so they included a novelty
category. One year a contestant performed while standing on her
head. Others have whistled to the accompaniment of typewriters,
kazoos and musical saws.
   Whistlers call their art a form of self-expression that's more
socially acceptable than bursting into song in public.
   ``It's nice to walk down the street and see people smiling at
you,'' Drummond says. ``If you walked down the street singing `How
Great Thou Art,' you'd get carted away in a wagon.''
   Technically, whistling is the sound produced by pushing air
through the rounded lips. Whistlers can control pitch by moving
their tongues and changing the flow of breath.
   Beyond that, techniques differ. Most make music by blowing air
out; a few, by drawing it in. Most pucker. Some smile widely as
they whistle through their teeth. Some produce a reedy sound deep
in their throats. Some whistle through their fingers, or their
fists.
   A few virtuosos can produce two notes almost simultaneously and
some boast ranges of two octaves or more.
   Whistling, so it is said, began as signaling. The earliest known
whistlers were shepherds and sailors, who wanted sounds to carry
great distances.
   In the United States, whistling was a popular form of music-hall
entertainment in the 19th and early 20th century. According to the
Oxford Companion to Music an entertainer named Mrs. Alice Shaw,
known as ``La Belle Siffleuse'' (The Beautiful Whistler), performed
throughout the country as well as for European royalty.
   Early in this century aspiring whistlers could study at Agnes
Woodward's California School of Artistic Whistling in Los Angeles.
It's gone, but there remain textbooks on the market such as ``How
To Whistle Like a Pro (Without Driving Anyone Else Crazy)'' by
David Harp.
   Musician Fred Lowrey performed with big band orchestras,
recorded a dozen albums and wrote his autobiography, ``Whistling in
the Dark.'' Contemporary whistlers still perform his version of
``Indian Love Call.''
   Not everyone appreciated the art. A 1986 Smithsonian magazine
article cited a 1931 complaint from Charles Shaw, a philosophy
professor at New York University.
   ``Whistling is an unmistakable sign of the moron,'' Shaw said.
   Why has whistling faded to a mere echo of its former glory?
   For one thing, Drummond says, much current music - rap, heavy
metal rock, synthesized pop - doesn't rely on the simple melodies
that translate easily to whistling. ``Even the Beatles are hard to
whistle,'' she says.
   Whistlers acknowledge, reluctantly, that some people find
whistling as annoying a habit as knuckle-cracking or pen-tapping.
   Whistling also carries some negative connotations. Tattle-tales
are whistle-blowers; a whistle-stop speech offers little substance.
Some people ``whistle past the graveyard'' to cover their fears;
cartoon characters whistle when they're trying to cover something
up.
   Women have had to overcome additional anti-whistling prejudices.
Victorian etiquette books declared the practice vulgar. In Louisa
May Alcott's ``Little Women,'' ladylike Meg exhorts sister Jo to
stop because ``it's so boyish.''
   Mimi Drummond quotes an old saying of uncertain origin:
   ``A whistling girl and a crowing hen
   ``Will surely come to some bad end.''

   Whistling may be on the wane, but it has had its moments in
American musical history.
   Whistling figured prominently in several movies, notably ``The
Bridge on the River Kwai'' and ``The High and the Mighty.'' And, of
course, Walt Disney's seven dwarfs in ``Snow White'' whistled while
they worked.
   Whistling also helped define Disney's oldest and most popular
character, Mickey Mouse. Early cartoons depict Mickey strolling
along, hands clasped behind his back, face tilted to the sky, lips
puckered.
   More recently, Jason Serinus of Los Angeles has provided the
whistling voice of Woodstock, Snoopy's feathered friend on the
``Charlie Brown'' specials.
   The cheerfully whistled theme song of the 1960s situation comedy
``Mayberry RFD'' still lives on in reruns.
   A few songs celebrate the art: ``Whistling in the Dark,'' for
instance or ``Whistle a Happy Tune'' from ``The King and I.'' Other
songs include whistled passages. The 1970s rock 'n' roll song,
``Hocus Pocus,'' consisted only of instrumental music interspersed
with yodeling and manic whistling.
   Movie and cartoon characters have long used whistling as an
obvious disguise for guilt. Ineffective talk is ``whistling in the
wind;'' nonsensical talk is ``just whistling Dixie.'' A gesture of
false courage is ``whistling past the graveyard.''
   Whistling also has its superstitions.
   Some hold that whistling inside a house is as risky as opening
an umbrella indoors. Well into the 20th century, whistling aboard
ship was said to summon up a gale. Whistling in a theater was
believed to doom the current production, and veteran journalists
swear it's bad luck to whistle in a newsroom.
   Some cultures have prohibited whistling altogether. Arab
countries consider it evil, and Victorian etiquette books
pronounced it vulgar, at least for women.
   Some people are annoyed by whistling or find it tiresome. No
more tiresome, though, than their stock remark: ``Did you have
birdseed for lunch?''

   EDITOR'S NOTE - In the Philippines, shaken by political and
social upheavals in its 44 years of independence, leaders come and
go but life in the countryside remains the same. In villages such
as Pililla it's a daily struggle for survival, but a pervading
fatalism and commitment to family provide a degree of stability.

   As the first rays of the sun burst
over the verdant mountains, villagers awaken to nature's alarm
clock, the cacophony of hundreds of roosters signaling a new day.
   Women in simple housedresses shuffle along the concrete streets
to the neighborhood ``sari-sari stores'' to buy food for breakfast,
usually rice eaten with fish caught in the nearby Laguna de Bay, a
huge freshwater lake.
   Men and women crowd around outdoor hand-cranked water pumps to
bathe in the cool morning hours.
   For the 25,000 people in this town 30 miles southeast of Manila,
this day will be much like the thousands which preceded it, a slow
search for food and sustenance.
   During the past decade, the Philippine Islands have been shaken
by political turmoil, economic dislocation and social unrest,
including the 1986 ``people power revolution'' that toppled the
late President Ferdinand Marcos and propelled Corazon Aquino into
the presidency.
   But in this town and thousands like it, where 70 percent of the
60 million Filipinos live, the rhythm of life has remained
unchanged despite the upheavals in the capital, Manila. Life here
is governed by customs and traditions shaped over the centuries.
   Critics complain that many aspects of that lifestyle - including
fatalism, family commitments and respect for authority - deter
social progress.
   But the timeless quality of Filipino life also provides a degree
of stability in a nation still struggling to define its system of
governing 44 years after independence from the United States.
   Urban Filipinos, grappling with pollution, overcrowding and
horrific traffic, tend to romanticize about the simple beauty of
life in the provinces.
   During religious festivals or public holidays, thousands of
urban dwellers return to the provinces to visit relatives and tend
the graves of ancestors. The better-off urban relatives often give
money to their less-fortunate kin or, if possible, help them get
jobs in the city.
   For those who stay behind in the provinces, life is a struggle.
   ``It seems that nothing much has changed,'' says Nita Bolante, a
housewife. ``Life is hard these days. Everything is expensive.''
   Pililla, a farming and fishing village in a relatively
prosperous province, isn't faced with the kind of hopeless poverty
seen in the mountain communities of Luzon Island or the hinterlands
of Mindanao, the second largest of the 7,100 Philippine Islands.
   But by Western standards, life here is still grim.
   Most people live in two-story, tin-roofed homes of wood and
stone built close by one another. The ground floor houses chickens
or an occasional pig and goat.
   The second story serves by day as a sitting room, by night as a
common bedroom where family members sleep on woven mats of palm
leaves. Many residents tend small vegetable plots in a country with
virtually a year-round growing season.
   During the day, crowds of young men, dressed in T-shirts and
shorts, loiter in the streets, unable to find work. So common is
the phenomenon that the Filipino language has a word for them -
``istambay,'' a Philippinized version of the English phrase ``I
stand by.''
   Most ``istambays'' work occasionally, helping out in the fields
during harvests, fishing or hustling cigarettes in the streets of
larger towns.
   When they accumulate a little money, they quit and fritter away
their time drinking local whisky until the cash is gone. Then they
work again.
   The Rev. Leonardo Legazpi, archbishop of Naga, attributes the
``istambay'' phenomenon to climate and centuries of colonial rule,
which discouraged personal initiative.
   ``You build your house, then the typhoon blows it down, and you
build it again,'' Legazpi says. ``The Filipino can work very hard,
but there's never a feeling that you work to improve your
condition.''
   One ``istambay,'' Ronnie Tejade, 28, says he worked most
recently at an appliance factory until he accumulated enough
seniority to qualify for severance pay.
   He then quit, collected his severance and used the money to pay
off his debts because his salary of $36 a month fell short of his
expenses.
   ``When I don't work, I earn nothing,'' Tejade says. ``When you
work, you still earn nothing. It comes to that.''
   But Asian fatalism has prevented this sense of hopelessness from
becoming the catalyst for social revolution.
   ``I'm not blaming the government,'' Tejade says as he sips his
whisky. ``We were born this way. We have to live our lives this
way.''
   Lack of educational opportunities contribute to the cycle.
Pililla has a free, state-run elementary school but the nearest
public high school is 15 miles away in Morong.
   There is no free school bus service, and many parents cannot
afford the $14 a month transportation charge, as well as fees for
books, meals and uniforms.
   For the more ambitious ``provinciano,'' the ticket to a better
life has traditionally been a job abroad, especially in the Middle
East. A half million Filipinos work in Saudi Arabia alone, and send
home their savings to families in the provinces.
   Many ``Saudi boys,'' as they are known locally, return with
savings which they invest in small businesses, such as neighborhood
stores.
   ``I have a dream, but it's still unfulfilled,'' says Hermi
Retuerna, 28, a foreman on a small farm. ``I want to join my
brother in Saudi Arabia. I want to leave for the future of my two
children.''
   Long-term separations strain family ties, but the alternatives
are worse.
   ``You may be together but you have nothing to eat and you cannot
send your children to school,'' says Mrs. Bolante, whose husband
works in Saudi Arabia and sends home $200 a month to his wife and
five children. ``At least there's an assurance you'll be able to
eat.''
   Family ties, strong in Philippine culture, keep many villagers
from leaving. As in other Asian societies, Filipinos often live in
extended families, with aged parents, breadwinners and children
under the same roof.
   Breadwinners pool their resources for the family's livelihood.
Those who cannot work are rarely turned away. The system inhibits a
natural flow of workers to available jobs and keeps unemployment
rates high in impoverished areas.
   But it also provides the individual Filipino with an economic
and psychological cushion in a country where few earn pensions or
collect welfare.
   ``It's better to stay here simply because of the family,'' says
Norbita Arevalo, a teacher and one of only two breadwinners in her
family of seven. ``It's more comfortable here in the province.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE - He was a farm boy from Kansas with his eyes on
the skies, a tinkerer who could build telescopes but had never been
to college. Then one day in 1930 Clyde Tombaugh spotted a dot in
the heavens that would change his life forever, not to mention
change the study of astronomy.

   Sixty years ater he discovered the
planet Pluto spinning three billion miles from Earth, Clyde
Tombaugh can't keep his hands off telescopes.
   At age 84, Tombaugh is supposed to be retired, resting on his
laurels as one of only four people ever to have discovered a
planet.
   Instead, the snowy-haired astronomer is still crisscrossing the
country, lecturing about Pluto to raise funds for post-doctoral
astronomy students at New Mexico State University, where he taught
for 12 years.
   And he's still building telescopes, which is how the former farm
boy got started in astronomy in the first place. At the moment,
he's working on one for his 16-year-old granddaughter.
   ``I'm going to have her do some of the polishing, and have her
test the curve,'' he says. ``She's going to get a good introduction
to it.''
   Tombaugh has no hobbies that aren't related to astronomy, his
lifelong love. ``I'm always interested in making telescopes,
grinding mirrors and so on,'' he says. ``I love that.''
   On a recent lecture stop in Spencerport, the planet hunter
handled a throng of elementary school students with the experienced
patter of a cornball comedian.
   ``That's a very good question!'' he told a girl who asked how
Pluto got its name. The name was chosen by scientists at Lowell
Observatory, where the planet was discovered, he says. Then, with
his face crinkling into a wide grin, he adds:
   ``Some people think it's named after Pluto the Pup. Of course
there's no connection. I think the planet came first - I'm not
sure.''
   ``How cold is Pluto?'' a student calls out.
   ``The air that you breathe - nitrogen and oxygen - would be
frozen solid rock on Pluto,'' Tombaugh says. ``It'd be a little
hard to breathe, wouldn't it?''
   Tombaugh was just 24, fresh off his family's Kansas wheat farm
with only a high school diploma to his name, when he discovered
Pluto in 1930. Six decades later, the discovery remains his
proudest achievement.
   Tombaugh got interested in astronomy in the sixth grade, when
his favorite subject was geography. ``I wondered what the geography
was like on other planets and I've been at it ever since,'' he
says.
   In high school, Tombaugh built a telescope and spent long hours
making careful drawings of Mars and Jupiter. He wanted to be an
astronomer, he says, but his family didn't have the money to send
him to college.
   In 1929, Tombaugh's drawings got him hired on a trial basis as
an assistant at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Ariz. He was
to help search for a trans-Neptunian planet with the observatory's
new 13-inch telescope.
   Of the nine planets now known to be circling the sun, six had
been known since antiquity. The English astronomer William Herschel
discovered the seventh, Uranus, in 1781. In 1846, two people are
credited with the discovery of Neptune, the eighth, the English
astronomer John C. Adams and the French mathematician Urbain J.J.
Leverrier.
   The existence of a ninth planet was predicted in 1915 by
Percival Lowell, who believed ``Planet X'' was causing deviations
in the orbits of Uranus and Neptune.
   Tombaugh's job was to compare 14-by-17-inch-photographs of the
night sky on a device called a blink-microscope-comparator, which
rapidly switched between two images taken several days apart. If a
planet were visible, it would have moved to a new position in the
second photograph. In more crowded areas of the universe, such as
the Milky Way, more than 2,000 stars filled every square inch of
the photograph. Each had to be examined for even the most
infinitesimal movement.
   ``It was tedious,'' Tombaugh says. ``But it was much more
interesting work than farming, as far as I was concerned.''
   On Feb. 18, 1930, Tombagh found what he was looking for. A tiny
dot of light had moved an eighth of an inch.
   ``It electrified me,'' he says. ``In one split second, I
realized I'd be world famous and turn the scientific world
upside-down. It was a tremendous feeling.
   ``I was excited, but I didn't go around yelling. I figured it'd
just alarm everybody. It alarmed them plenty when I told them I
found a planet.''
   As it turned out, Lowell's prediction of Planet X's location had
just been lucky. Pluto - now estimated to have about two-tenths of
a percent of Earth's mass - is much too small to cause
irregularities in the other planets' orbits.
   For finding Pluto, the novice astronomer got a $10 raise and a
nominal prize from the Royal Astronomical Society in Great Britain.
   Later, Tombaugh got a bachelor's and master's degree in
astronomy from the University of Kansas and continued combing the
skies - discovering a globular star cluster, a supercluster of
galaxies, several lesser clusters, one comet and about 775
asteroids, one of which bears his name.
   Tombaugh lives in Las Cruces, N.M. with Patricia, his wife of 56
years, and a mostly black cat named Pluto. He wears a watch his son
had made for him, which features Walt Disney's cartoon dog Pluto.
   Tombaugh doesn't put much stock in speculation that a 10th
planet exists. It could be out there, but it would have to be very
small or very far away for him to have missed seeing it on his
plates, he says.
   ``It'd be interesting to see if they ever did find one, but it's
going to be some hard digging,'' he says. ``Actually, I'm a little
pessimistic about it.''
   Tombaugh says he has looked at 45 million stars in his lifetime
- more than two-thirds of the visible universe. He has seen more of
the heavens' starry expanses than perhaps anyone else.
   ``I had a grand view of the universe,'' he says. ``I often
wonder how people who never had any exposure to this view the
world. ``They're not aware of all this universe around them - they
think the Earth is it.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE - Their names are Olivier and Redgrave and Cusack,
three of the most famous names in the London theater. This season
several members of those families are teaming up in the same plays,
``a sort of thinking man's Osmonds,'' as one newspaper columnist
put it.

   Despite some sniping that it smacks of gimmickry,
the London theater is celebrating its English and Irish acting
dynasties with three productions that are truly family affairs.
   On Dec. 5, Laurence Olivier's widow, Joan Plowright, opened at
the Old Vic Theater in a revival of J.B. Priestley's ``Time and the
Conways.'' The cast includes the two Olivier daughters, Tamsin and
Julie-Kate, directed by their brother, Richard.
   One week later, Dec. 11, came the Redgrave sisters, Vanessa and
Lynn, in Anton Chekhov's ``The Three Sisters.'' The opening at the
Queen's Theater marks their first stage appearance together.
   The third sister is played by their 24-year-old niece, Jemma
Redgrave, the daughter of their actor brother Corin. Jemma joins
her cousins, Natasha and Joely Richardson, in the fifth generation
of acting Redgraves.
   Chekhov's masterwork has already been seen in another family
production in London this year. That sold-out production, which
ended Sept. 29, starred Ireland's Cusack sisters - Sinead, Sorcha
and Niamh Cusack - and their father, Cyril.
   While keenly aware that these ventures are vulnerable to charges
of gimmickry, all three families found the blood ties invigorating.
   ``We were all very aware of the pitfalls,'' says Sorcha Cusack.
``That's why it took us so long to commit ourselves to doing it.''
   Lynn Redgrave says, ``Whatever we did together, it had not to be
a gimmick. It had to be something that in any legitimate production
anywhere we would have been thought of for those parts.''
   The productions have been warmly supported by audiences and
critics, though not without dissent.
   ``Lack of box office bankability, singly, is bolstered by the
sheer gimmickiness of having all the family work together - a sort
of thinking man's Osmonds,'' snarled columnist Julie Burchill in
The Mail, a Sunday newspaper.
   Most commentators, however, were enthusiastic about productions
that bring a lifetime of intimacy to the theater.
   ``I just think that if you've got a vocabulary that goes back 40
years, as is the case with myself and Sorcha, there's no doubt at
all that we have a given,'' says Sinead Cusack.
   ``It's there in our bloodstream, our very being, which is to do
with our umbilical cords.''
   Sinead, at age 42 the oldest Cusack sister, played Masha, the
middle one of Chekhov's trio. Sorcha, 40, played the older Olga.
Niamh, 30, played baby sister Irina in a production that looks
likely to transfer to New York in the new year.
   Lynn Redgrave says her family's production resulted from a
benefit performance on Dec. 10, 1989, in New York, where Vanessa
was finishing her Broadway engagement in Tennessee Williams'
``Orpheus Descending.''
   Vanessa was organizing a concert called ``The Wall Breaks'' to
benefit victims of Stalin's repression. To conclude the first act,
she asked Lynn, Sigourney Weaver and Christopher Reeve to join her
in a condensed version of the final scene of ``The Three Sisters.''
   ``I was full of nerves about it,'' recalls Lynn Redgrave, 47,
the younger sister by six years. ``There was a real sort of quiet
in the house, and one realized: Here we were walking forward for
the first time.''
   Before long, a project was born.
   ``The minute we did the concert, I knew this could work, which
is why we so wholeheartedly went into it,'' she says.
   ``The Three Sisters'' is actually the second sisters' act for
the Redgraves.
   Four days before rehearsals began, they completed a TV remake of
the 1962 horror film, ``Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?'' It's due
to be aired in the United States on ABC in February. Lynn inherits
Bette Davis's role as the demented Baby Jane Hudson, with Vanessa
filling Joan Crawford's shoes as her crippled sister.
   ``We haven't spent this much consecutive time together since we
were children,'' laughs Lynn Redgrave, who, unlike Vanessa, has
based most of her career in the United States. ``It's bringing back
memories we haven't had in ages.''
   But Lynn says there were times when sibling undercurrents left
off and Chekhov's creations took over.
   ``We feel very much that we are these characters, or our version
of these characters,'' she says. ``While we're actually playing it,
the family links are a bit more amorphous.''
   Sorcha Cusack had a similar experience: ``Obviously, when I'm
working, I'm not thinking whether it's my sister or not my sister,
but of course they are my sisters; that's something that's there
for free. I don't think about it.''
   In ``Time and the Conways,'' written in 1937, Joan Plowright
plays the matriarch presiding over a brood of kids, two of whom are
played by her and Lord Olivier's real-life daughters.
   ``It can help - well, it does help - a lot because you are
dealing with people who are very close to you, and all that feeling
of familiarity is there for you,'' says Tamsin Olivier, 27.
   But her 29-year-old brother Richard, the play's director,
stresses that Priestley was writing about the Conways, not the
Oliviers.
   ``I wouldn't want people to `family spot','' he says.
``Hopefully, they come to see the play primarily, and if they enjoy
people's performances, then that's terrific.''
   Next spring, Timothy West and Prunella Scales - husband and wife
in real life - play the fraught Tyrones in Eugene O'Neill's ``Long
Day's Journey into Night'' at the Royal National Theater. No word
yet on whether their son, Sam West, an actor, will play one of the
Tyrones' two sons.
   Other family connections have yet to be explored.
   Maggie Smith, the Tony-winning star of Broadway's ``Lettice and
Lovage,'' has two sons in drama school. Rosemary Harris' daughter,
Jennifer Ehle, is in her last year at London's Central School of
Speech and Drama. Susannah York, Edward Woodward and Frank Finlay
each have children who have decided to act.
   In the United States, if famous families appear together at all,
it's usually on the screen: Henry and Jane Fonda in ``On Golden
Pond,'' Beau and Jeff Bridges in ``The Fabulous Baker Boys,'' the
Carradines, Quaids, Guests and Keaches in ``The Long Riders.''

   Bill Smitrovich says his portrayal of a
``working class guy'' on ABC's ``Life Goes On'' is patterned after
a man who remains a symbol in his own life.
   ``I put a lot of my father into Drew Thatcher,'' he says. ``He's
a throwback to a man who's lived through tough times. I draw the
spirit of Drew from my father. They're from the same kind of
hard-working background.''
   ``Life Goes On'' is about a family facing a financial struggle
and the challenge of a son with Downs syndrome. It also stars Patti
LuPone as his wife, Libby, Chris Burke as Corky, their son, and
Kellie Martin as Becca, their daughter.
   Smitrovich's father, William S. Smitrovich Sr., who died in
1965, moved his family from Connecticut to New Mexico to California
in search of work as a tool and die maker. Bill, the actor,
attended 12 different schools before the family returned to
Connecticut.
   His father had asthma ``and often slept sitting up,'' he says.
``But at 6 a.m. every morning he was up and at 'em. He had a sense
of duty, pride and workmanship.''
   Smitrovich fulfilled his father's dream by getting a degree at
the University of Bridgeport. It was in college that he discovered
his love of acting. And he gave some of his time to a cause he
believes helped him prepare for his role in ``Life Goes On.''
   While in college he minored in special education and tutored
children with Downs syndrome. After graduation he was a leader in a
work shelter for children with Downs syndrome and cerebral palsy.
   ``Drew's a high-principled man who tries to live for his
family,'' Smitrovich says. ``I think he feels that when Corky came
into his life that was a message. He's a God-fearing man. Part of
him would like to have a `normal' son. And he's a frustrated man
because he's never gotten to fulfill some of his dreams.
   ``He went into construction work because he couldn't become an
architect. Now he owns a restaurant because he wants to be his own
boss. He's a hard-working, middle-class American who believes in
the union and buying American. He believes in the American dream
but has probably been burned by it a few times.''
   On ``Life Goes On,'' the Thatchers will have another child at
the end of the season. LuPone, who is pregnant, filmed her scenes
for three shows in advance of her absence for maternity leave.
She'll miss several episodes, but she will return afterward and
wear a ``fat suit'' until the Thatcher baby is born.
   ``Life Goes On'' is the second series for Smitrovich, who was
Sgt. Danny Krychek in NBC's ``Crime Story.'' He co-starred in
``Crazy People'' and has been in such movies as ``Without a
Trace,'' ``Splash,'' ``Maria's Lovers,'' ``A Little Sex,'' ``Silver
Bullet,'' ``Manhunter,'' ``Her Alibi'' and ``Renegades.''
   In the ``Miami Vice'' pilot he was Sonny Crockett's partner who
became corrupt to get money for his son who requires use of a
wheelchair.
   Smitrovich is living in Southern California for the series, but
also has a home in Connecticut. He's married to Shaw Purnell, an
actress he met while doing a play in New York. She was his ex-wife
in the play, ``Never Say Die.'' His son, Alexander John, called
``A.J.,'' was born in Nevada while he was working on ``Crime
Story.''
   ``I was creatively frustrated doing `Crime Story' because it was
more style than substance,'' he says. ``It was set in the 1950s
with the old cars and clothes, and I worked with a great bunch of
guys. But I wished we'd stayed in Chicago with the show. It got too
glitzy in Las Vegas. I was hoping we'd be like a grand opera comic
book, but it never reached those heights.''

   The 16 musicals created by George and Ira
Gershwin between 1921 and 1933 were not written for posterity. They
only had a life expectancy of their original Broadway runs.
   When these shows closed after six months or sometimes a year, no
one ever bothered to preserve all the material from them. Hit songs
such as ``The Man I Love,'' ``I Got Rhythm,'' ``Someone To Watch
over Me,'' ``S'Wonderful'' and others survived, but the musicals
they were from often did not.
   There wasn't the sense that anyone would want to hear - some 50
or 60 years later - the entire score from ``Girl Crazy,'' ``Strike
Up the Band,'' ``Treasure Girl,'' ``Funny Face,'' ``Lady, Be
Good!'' and ``Tip-Toes.''
   With the advent of the cast album in 1943 that changed.
Audiences found a way to keep alive their memories of original
performances. But George and Ira Gershwin had written their last
Broadway show nearly a decade earlier.
   Now a major recording project is under way to document all the
Gershwin theater works, including the shows lyricist Ira Gershwin
wrote with other composers, such as Kurt Weill, Vernon Duke and
Arthur Schwartz. The recordings will use scores carefully
reconstructed from original manuscripts.
   The comprehensive effort has been financed by Leonore Gershwin,
Ira's widow. Mrs. Gershwin, now 90, formed Roxbury Recordings,
named after the stately drive in Beverly Hills where the couple
lived and where she still lives.
   ``She has taken it as a mission in life to make sure that the
works of her husband and his brother are preserved in the best
possible way,'' says Michael Strunsky, Mrs. Gershwin's nephew who
represents her on the project. ``My aunt wants people forever to
hear what George and Ira really wrote, at a quality level they
would be proud of.''
   The company's first effort, released in December on Electra
Nonesuch Records and done in collaboration with the Library of
Congress, is ``Girl Crazy,'' a 1930 Gershwin musical trifle
fashioned for Willie Howard, a big musical comedy star of the day.
The original show also featured two teen-agers, one named Ethel
Merman and the other Ginger Rogers.
   The new release, the first complete recording of the show, stars
Lorna Luft in the Merman role, Judy Blazer singing Rogers' part,
David Carroll and Frank Gorshin.
   ``In a sense, we are the show's original cast album,'' says
Luft, who had the daunting task of singing ``I Got Rhythm'' and
``Boy! What Love Has Done to Me!'' - two songs closely associated
with Merman throughout her career.
   ``There were no modern interpretations on the recording,'' Luft
says. ``There is a tendency, of course, with songs like `I Got
Rhythm' to use a more up-to-date vocal style. I had to not use it
at all.''
   ``You want to exude a sense of fun with this music,'' says John
Mauceri, conductor of the new recording and a champion of restoring
old Broadway musicals for stage and record. ``It should be quite
contagious.
   ``Sometimes you'll hear a recent recording of an old show, and
it sounds like an adult education course. And then when you listen
to the original performers on old 78 records, you smile. One of the
things I wanted to make sure was present in this music was its
smile. `Girl Crazy' is one of the happiest scores George and Ira
ever wrote.''
   Listen to modern versions of ``I Got Rhythm,'' Mauceri says.
Most singers seem to get the rhythm wrong.
   ``If you're doing it right, it's very entertaining,'' he says.
``The orchestrations and the arrangements really only work when you
sing them in the right style.''
   The problem is that most of those original orchestrations have
long disappeared. Research was required to put the shows back into
their original state.
   Restoration work on ``Girl Crazy'' was supervised by Tommy
Krasker, producer of the recording series and archivist for the
Gershwin estate. His task, which took about six months, was made
easier because much of the show's original material, including
orchestrations, was available.
   Krasker was not so lucky with ``Strike Up the Band,'' the second
show in the project, which was recorded in early December with
Mauceri again conducting. An extensive research effort had to be
undertaken.
   At the Gershwin home in California, Krasker pored over musical
manuscripts, lyric sheets and scrapbooks about the show. He scoured
old reviews and other newspaper articles, listened to period
recordings and studied photographs.
   ``Strike Up the Band,'' which originally had a book by George S.
Kaufman, was one of the Gershwins' most interesting failures - and
successes. A 1927 version of the show closed in Philadelphia and
never made it to New York. A revised version became a hit three
years later. Roxbury has recorded both versions and will release
them next summer.
   The first version of ``Strike Up the Band'' was a dark comedy,
an anti-war piece about the United States going to war with
Swizterland to protest a tariff on Swiss cheese. The second, with a
revised book by Morris Ryskind, softened the anti-war tone, turning
the war into a dream sequence and the fight over cheese into a
battle over chocolate.
   ```Strike Up the Band' certainly was ground-breaking in terms of
subject matter, characterization, integration of script and
score,'' Krasker says.
   The problem was that outside of piano-vocal material and lyric
sheets, not much of the original remained. Out of some 40 songs in
the two versions of the show, Krasker found orchestrations for only
six.
   What he did was hire six of the theater's most accomplished
orchestrators - Sid Ramin, Bill Brohn, Dick Hyman, Russell Warner,
Larry Wilcox and Ralph Burns - to write orchestrations in the style
of the period.
   All the lyrics for ``Strike Up the Band'' were found, and only
one piece of music - the verse to a song called ``Meadow Serenade''
- was missing. Its refrain had been remembered by Kay Swift, a
composer and good friend of George Gershwin.
   Krasker asked Burton Lane, composer of ``Finian's Rainbow'' and
a one-time collaborator of Ira Gershwin, to write a new verse.
   ``A few days after I handed him the lyric, he came in with a
tune that was absolutely wonderful,'' he says. ``It feels like it
was all written in one stroke. Burton's verse and George's refrain
complement each other beautifully. I have to think it's going to be
one of the highlights of the recording.''

   ``Guitar Music of Nicolo Paganini'' (Europa) - Frederic Zigante
   
   Paganini, the demon of the violin who transformed the
instrument's technique and turned himself into legend, was also an
accomplished guitarist. That is no secret, nor the fact that he
wrote numerous chamber works involving the guitar, usually with
violin.
   But Paganini (1782-1840) also wrote an astonishingly vast - and
until recently - unknown number of solo works for the instrument. A
complete edition was not published until the mid-1980s, 150 years
after they were written. Before then, only 26 of his guitar pieces
were available, dating from a 1926 edition. Europa introduces most
of this new richness of repertoire on four discs, beautifully
played by Frederic Zigante.
   The pieces on the release break down into 40 sonatas, five
sonatinas, 16 various one-movement works and 43 ghiribizzi, or
popular song transcriptions from Mozart, Paganini himself and
lesser composers of the day.
   According to Zigante's excellent notes, Paganini publicly never
performed any of these, though he might have planned to publish
some during his lifetime because a small number survive in neat
copies apparently prepared for a printer. Paganini was also
famously protective of his manuscripts. When concertizing around
Europe, he would personally distribute and retrieve the orchestra
parts to his concertos for fear of pirated editions.
   Because he rarely played the guitar in public, and because he
learned it pretty much on his own, Paganini developed his own
guitar technique. Zigante points out that he doesn't use the
progression of positions of standard 19th-century technique, and
writes music that is horizontal in nature - more like a violin, and
less like vertical, chordal writing more typical of the instrument.
   Many of Paganini's violinistic tendencies can be heard -
arpeggios beginning phrases, sudden register changes, leaps and
fast scales. But more striking are the large number of simpler
pieces with easy flowing melodies and natural-sounding
accompaniment.
   Zigante's playing matches his scholarship. He has a warm sound
and lyrical manner, and keeps an obvious affection for this music
despite recording more than 100 pieces, totaling four hours and 20
minutes, by the same composer.
   It is a wealth of excellent music for classical guitar lovers
and listeners partial to 19th-century Italian melody. One hopes it
will spur interest in Paganini's guitar output and prompt more live
performances of it by guitarists.

   ``Triple Threat'' (Alligator Records) - Lucky Peterson
   
   A 20-plus-year career would denote senior status for many
performers. Bluesman Lucky Peterson's 20-plus years of performing
leave him in his mid-20s with 20-plus years to go. A musical
prodigy at 3, Peterson is emerging as a young ambassador of the
blues. Robert Cray may have the name recognition and the big record
label contract, but Peterson is one to watch.
   ``Triple Threat,'' Peterson's second effort for Alligator
Records and his fourth solo LP is an excellent showcase for the
multitalented native of Buffalo, N.Y. Peterson massages the
keyboards with the same soul that wells up out of his big voice.
For proof, listen to ``I'm Free.'' You'll also hear the third of
Peterson's triple threats, his fine guitar playing.
   Where Cray has shaped his earlier, raw sounds to draw more
commercial appeal, Peterson still revels in the edginess of a
tough, urban beat. But there's a healthy dose of soul running
through the record. There's also great potential for Peterson to
take his ambassadorship across the line of commercialism ala Cray
and spread the word of the blues.
   Lyrics on ``Triple Threat'' don't grab hold of your short-term
memory like more commercial music does. You're not likely to find
yourself repeating ``Don't cloud up on me if you ain't going to
rain'' in the shower. But for that weakness, the record is a great
mix of funky soul and blues with a beat.

   For 30 years they have been an
ideal combination of filmmakers: James Ivory, the aesthetic
American director of a series of literate movies; Ismail Merchant,
the well-named producer from India, the voluble moneyraiser for his
partner's dreams.
   Actually it's a triumvirate. Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, German-born
of Polish parents, educated in England and married to an Indian
architect, has written most of the 15 Merchant-Ivory features. The
trio combined again on their most ambitious venture yet: ``Mr. and
Mrs. Bridge,'' starring Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward.
   Most of the trio's films have literary beginnings: Henry James'
``The Europeans'' and ``The Bostonians'' and E.M. Forster's ``Room
with a View'' and ``Maurice,'' for example.
   ``Mr. and Mrs. Bridge'' stems from a pair of novels by Evan S.
Connell. They trace 30 years of marriage of a well-to-do Kansas
City couple.
   Ivory and Merchant sat down for a joint interview at the Beverly
Hills Hotel. Ivory is a well-groomed, meticulous man, born in
Berkeley, Calif., and educated at the University of Oregon and the
University of Southern California film school. His fascination with
India led him to make documentaries about Indian art and life in
Delhi. In 1961 he joined with Merchant and Jhabvala in their first
feature, ``The Householder.''
   Born in Bombay, Merchant has lived and worked in Europe and
America; he graduated in business from New York University. He
became partners with Ivory when they met at the Cannes Film
Festival. A born salesman, Merchant financed their early films with
the frozen rupee funds of American distributors.
   Financing ``Mr. and Mrs. Bridge'' was an easy sell, Merchant
said. With Jhabvala's script and the Newmans' participation, he was
able to make a deal with his first customer, Cineplex Odeon.
   The film cost $7.5 million, and all of it is visible on the
screen, he insisted. He cited the cooperation of people in Kansas
City, as well as New York suppliers. One of them contributed
$250,000 worth of draperies and other materials.
   ``Let's not get lost here,'' snapped Ivory, ever the director.
``Why don't we start all over again. Let's not go into a thing
about the draperies. Let that be a later question.
   ``Let's get on to the key source of our success: good script,
good actors, good material. That's why we've gotten wherever we
have gotten.''
   Ivory also bristled at the suggestion that he was dealing with
superstars for the first time in ``Mr. and Mrs. Bridge'':
   ``It's not for the first time. It's the first time in the sense
of working in the United States, yes, certainly. But I've worked
with some superstars in Great Britain. Maggie Smith, James Mason,
Vanessa Redgrave, all marvelous actors. In my mind, Paul and Joanne
are in that league of great actors.''
   The project grew out of a dinner conversation with Miss Woodward
in New York.
   ``It was an accidental conversation,'' reported Merchant. ``We
started talking about books, and Joanne said she had read this
wonderful book, `Mrs. Bridge,' but not many people knew about it.
Jim had found it 20 years ago in Calcutta in a small bookstore. He
gave it to me and said, `It's a wonderful book, it could make a
good movie.'''
   ``It was Joanne's project,'' continued Ivory. ``She wanted to
make `Mrs. Bridge' for television, and she already had an
arrangement with (producer) Robert Halmi. We talked them into
combining the book with `Mr. Bridge.' Paul said if he liked the
script, he would play Mr. Bridge. He did like the script, and
that's how we got going.''
   Both Newmans have been directors, but Ivory said that posed no
problems.
   ``That just made it easier. We got over a lot of material fast
that might have taken longer. He knows the problems of a relatively
small production, having so recently done `The Glass Menagerie'
(with Woodward as star). He knew that we had to move swiftly. There
was a lot of hard work and long hours. They accepted that sort of
thing very well.''
   ``Mr. and Mrs. Bridge'' was filmed in Paris, New York and Canada
(for snow) as well as Kansas City. It was an amazing feat on a $7.5
million budget.
   Wouldn't it be easier for Merchant-Ivory to hook up with a major
studio and let it worry about financing?
   ``We've also hooked up with major companies, and we've made
exactly the film we wanted to make,'' said Ivory. ``And it was
certainly less of a headache for Ismail.''
   ``The important thing is to have one source of money, as we did
on this picture,'' said Merchant. ``Today, Merchant-Ivory has made
about 28 films (including TV). The negatives belong to us. If you
have a studio deal, the negatives belong to the studio.''
   Inevitably, there are clashes between art (Ivory) and commerce
(Merchant). The director cited an instance on ``Mr. and Mrs.
Bridge.'' He wanted a period fire engine for a scene in which a car
is burned. Such a machine was available in Kansas City, but
Merchant didn't want to pay for it. ``I finally convinced him it
was necessary,'' said Ivory.
   Would Merchant like to sit in the director's chair?
   ``Well, I'm a good entrepreneur and organizer, I like to take
the challenge of producing the picture,'' he replied. ``I am going
to direct a film which is set in India, `In Custody.' I did `The
Courtesans of Bombay' some years ago and a short film, `Mahatma and
the Bad Boy.' I must say I felt wonderful at the time, because
someone is taking all your orders, doing all your things, and you
are the boss.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Cultural Artifacts From Alaska and Siberia</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LOUINN LOTA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>

   A cultural thaw opened the way, but it took
10 years to put together a show of long stored masks, weapons and
ceremonial clothes used by the peoples of the frigid lands on both
sides of the Bering Strait.
   ``Crossroads of Continents: Cultures of Siberia and Alaska'' is
a Smithsonian Institution traveling exhibit now at the Gene Autry
Western Heritage Museum in Griffith Park.
   The idea for the exhibit of about 600 cultural artifacts arose
as a bridge between the Soviet Union and the United States, but the
project endured some chilly times before the recent dramatic
improvement in relations.
   ``We were delayed because of political problems,'' the exhibit's
curator, William W. Fitzhugh, said in an interview from his office
in Washington.
   ``We were fighting against the image of `The Evil Empire.' We
were the test wave of glasnost,'' said Fitzhugh, who is director of
the Smithsonian's Center for Arctic Studies.
   Sergei Serov, Fitzhugh's Soviet counterpart and senior
researcher with Leningrad's Institute of Ethnology, said the
project went well at their level. ``We experienced no problems with
cooperation between scholars,'' he said.
   The monumental task of uniting collections from the two
countries started in 1978 when the Soviet Union became more
receptive to scholarly exchanges, Fitzhugh said.
   ``If you take a project of this geographic scope, immensity, you
need time just to get familiar with the objects,'' he said.
``Documentation takes many, many hours. And we had no funding from
any American corporations.''
   Fitzhugh and his team made several trips to the Soviet Union,
and Russian researchers made similar trips here.
   In musty, dusty corners of museum warehouses, attics and
basements, Fitzhugh found items he had only read about from the
years before the United States bought Alaska from Russia in 1867.
``We were rediscovering collections that long had been in
storage,'' he said.
   ``It is quite a task to pack, to mount, to dismount and check
all the items and do condition checks and damage checks,'' said
Serov. ``We have been lucky that nothing has been seriously
damaged.''
   Enthusiasts who attend the display of jewelry, ivory work,
masks, religious costumes and everyday items like hunting and
fishing tools walk into darkened rooms that create an arctic winter
atmosphere.
   The lighting is subdued due to the fragility of the artifacts,
some a century old. The pieces are sensitive to light and could be
permanently damaged if exposed.
   ``The artifacts are made with vegetable and animal dyes and the
peoples who created them were accustomed to throwing them away
after they were used,'' Fitzhugh said.
   ``Things made for everyday use were expendable after a couple of
months,'' he added.
   One example of the elaborate work is a Siberian bucket made from
the jawbone of a whale. Using bentwood techniques, the jaw was
soaked, bent, riveted and fastened to a wooden bottom. The
ornamental trim decorated the handle of what was believed to be a
chamber pot.
   The exhibit was unveiled in 1988 at the National Museum of
Natural History in Washington. It also was displayed in Seattle and
New York in 1989 and was shown earlier this year in Indianapolis.
   It will be at the Western Heritage Museum until Feb. 24. Then it
will move on to the Anchorage Museum of History and Art in Alaska
and the Canadian Museum of Civilization in Ottawa.
   In 1992, organizers hope to take the exhibit to the Soviet Union
to cities including Moscow, Leningrad and Novosibirsk.
   Museum visitors who crave more Soviet art can view the work of
eight Russian artists at the Lori Kaye Gallery in Garden Grove. The
exhibit, which opened Nov. 29, includes 40 watercolors by Vasil
Panikarov, most of them still lifes ``enabling him to escape the
gloomy Russian everyday life.''
   The exhibit also includes ``The Window'' by the late Alexander
Freyidin, whose works are considered national treasures and
restricted from leaving the country.
   The other artists with works in the show are Constantin Filatov,
Victor Resovich, Lev Michaelovich Shmoys, Gavzdinskaya, Natalya
Teodorvna Tchulvaloma and Vera Alexandra Tchiyka.
   Another Soviet exhibit, ``Keepers of the Flame,'' was organized
by Selma Holo, director of the University of Southern California's
Fisher Gallery. Open until Jan. 19, it will be taken to three other
college campus galleries.
   ``Keepers of the Flame'' is a show of 25 unofficial or
underground artists. Before the era of glasnost, artists who did
not qualify to join the official artists union were not recognized
and banned from public exhibit. In 1975, the KGB dismantled an
outdoor show of such art.
   Lori Kaye said the Soviet artists' ``view of life is very
different.''
   Just getting art supplies in the Soviet Union is a test of an
artist's commitment to the craft, she said.
   ``Paper is often crude and causes the watercolors to react very
differently,'' she said. ``The paints themselves are difficult to
find and often have to be made using old-fashioned techniques such
as squeezing the oils from flower petals.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: Spies in the House of Was</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Success has (has not) been sweet for Was (Not
Was).
   For years, they were a funny, funky Detroit band, with singers
Sweet Pea Atkinson and Sir Harry Bowens, songwriters David and Don
Was and a handful of listeners. Their first two albums bombed. They
spent much of the 1980s bouncing around Europe.
   That made sense to David and Don, perpetual outsiders, pariahs
with pride. They expected mistreatment at the hands of the record
industry. They'd rather crash parties than be invited.
   But for the past two years, separately and together, the Wases
couldn't lose. ``Walk the Dinosaur'' and ``Spy in the House of
Love'' were hit singles. Their third album, ``What Up Dog?,'' went
gold. Don Was topped that by producing platinum records for Bonne
Raitt and the B-52's.
   Suddenly, everybody wanted to know about Was (Not Was), and when
they got around to making their next record, ``Are You O.K?,'' they
felt self-conscious, sensitive to the presence of spies in the
house of Was.
   ``I actually feel this is a fine record,'' said David,
interviewed with Don Was at a Manhattan hotel. ``But I'm glad we
got rid of it. The follow-up to a hit - it's like having a genius
kid and the next kid grows up and all you can see is the new kid in
the image of the older one. I think the next one we'll lose the
jitters, the pressure'll be off or something.''
   ``We thought we had a soft image, nothing like we really were,''
Don added. ``We went in the studio and the album took on a life of
its own. It was nothing like we planned.''
   After ``Are You O.K?'' they may have to start crashing parties
again; the album has quickly vanished from the charts. They knew
they were in trouble from the first single. A British A&amp;R (artist
and repertoire) man urged the Wases to take advantage of their
Motown roots and top-notch singers. Why not cover that old
Temptations hit, ``Papa Was a Rollin' Stone''?
   They had performed the song in concert, with great success, so
they gave it a shot in the studio, sticking closely to the original
version.
   The single flopped.
   ``Don put a nice beat under it, but otherwise it was
fruitless,'' David said. ``The singers are too close, they can `do'
the Temptations practically.
   ``We liked the song. It was a chance to pay homage to our soul
roots and it was a way of making a statement about today's
problems. The only problem was having it represent us as the first
single on the marketplace. Here's Was (Not Was) and their first
single is a cover. Maybe it was ill-advised.''
   If success has had an effect, it's made them more philosophical,
more concerned about being taken seriously.
   The problem: They are funny, very funny. Who else but Was (Not
Was) could get signed to their first contract with the help of a
flattering letter from jazz critic David Weiss, a.k.a. David Was?
Who else would come up with titles such as ``I Feel Better Than
James Brown'' and ``Earth to Doris.'' And who else but David Was
would let his young son pick out a Christmas tree and then help him
steal it?
   Yet, listen to ``Love Can Be Bad Luck'' off ``What Up Dog?'' or
``How the Heart Behaves'' from the new record. In quieter moments,
they're more likely to write lyrics such as these from ``Love Can
Be Bad Luck'':
   ``When two cars crash, you just pull them apart. But when lovers
come to together, they get tangled heart to heart.''
   ``When we saw `Walk the Dinosaur' work, we saw what the world
wanted us to and meant us to be: cartoonish, lovable, black and
white, kind of a fun party band,'' David explained.
   ``We tried to resist that definition with all of our energy, but
in a way I think we set ourselves up for it. In a way I'd like to
have Peter Gabriel's audience: listening hard, committed.''
   Don Fagenson and David Weiss grew up in suburban Detroit in the
1960s, their friendship sealed in eighth grade outside the
principal's office; both were there on detention.
   Similar in their thinking, the Wases are easy to tell apart.
Don's hair is dark - and wavy; David's is blond - and frizzy. Don
wears shades; David doesn't. David's voice is lower, a stage
whisper.
   ``It was a matter of finding a sensibility with someone,'' David
said. ``Those were fairly strained times. Growing up bored in the
suburbs. What do you do with yourself?
   ``We'd go on poetry writing missions, going to local shrines, to
a water tower at the mall. This was our religious life. Then it
burgeoned into full-blown productions when Don started
experimenting with tape recorders.''
   They formed the group in 1980, the name springing from the mouth
of Don's 2-year-old son. Atkinson and Bowen, studio performers in
Detroit, were recruited as singers.
   David, a history buff, thinks Was (Not Was) is going through its
``Baroque'' phase, a time of self-awareness, when every song
carries the weight of songs written before.
   ``If this was our last record, I would say we went out with a
whimper and not a bang,'' he said of ``Are You O.K?'' But he
dismisses the lull as ``birth pangs,'' growing pains for a band
with mixed feelings about growing up, a time when the only way to
go forward might be to take a giant step back.
   ``I think, and I don't really care if our company (Chrysalis)
reads this or not, we would be so much better off if they got sick
of us and said goodbye,'' David said.
   ``It would be nice to make records that didn't reflect having to
recoup such an enormous amount for a company. ... It would be nice
if we could go back to the beginning and make a record for
$18,000.''

<TEXT>
   ``The Great Gatsby'' is still one of Geoffrey
Wolff's favorite books, and narrator Nick Carraway's insistence
that he is ``inclined to reserve all judgments'' still makes the
author laugh.
   The novel is nothing but judgments, Wolff insists, a young man's
moral education. Carraway never stops evaluating Gatsby or Daisy or
Tom Buchanan - or himself. He has an opinion on everything, and his
opinion is constantly shifting.
   But Wolff doesn't mean that as criticism. He considers Carraway
the perfect writer, an inspiration for his own books, a man who
both observes and participates. Making judgments, and then changing
them, is part of the process, a moral education for an author who
learns something new with every word.
   ``We're told, teachers tell us, `Show, don't tell, show, don't
tell, show don't tell.' I don't feel comfortable only showing, I do
want to tell when I have a judgment to sound off on,'' Wolff,
author of ``The Duke of Deception: Memories of My Father,''
``Providence'' and the new ``The Final Club,'' said in an
interview.
   ``I think some things are right and some things are wrong. I
like to say when I think this person shouldn't have done something,
even at the old-fashioned primitive level that violates all the
aesthetics. For better or worse, I feel that's something I've been
doing.''
   ``The Final Club'' (Alfred A. Knopf, $19.95) is narrated by
Nathaniel Clay, a Princeton University student, class of '60, who
leaves behind a troubled family life in Seattle.
   His education begins immediately, on the eastbound Empire
Builder train, when he meets the beautiful Diana (pronounced
Dee-ah-nah, she emphasizes) Carr, falling madly in love with a
woman who either flirts with him or ignores him.
   This is straight out of F. Scott Fitzgerald, a relationship much
like the one in the short story ``Winter Dreams,'' in which a caddy
spots an 11-year-old girl on a golf course and never looks at life
the same way again.
   Even when Nathaniel declares he will no longer pursue Diana, he
admits he will always hold her up as some kind of ideal,
remembering her the night she showed up 42 minutes late for a
meeting under the giant clock at Manhattan's Grand Central Station.
   ---
   ``Nathaniel was past answering Diana's questions. She had asked
at least one question too many. But he'd never forget the way she
smelled, and years later he'd ask the snit behind the perfume
counter at Bendel's to spray his palm with this scent and that
scent, hoping to find that smell, and give it to the woman he was
about to marry, so that his wife would smell just as Diana smelled
tonight.''
   ---
   ``I'm interested in moments that change lives,'' Wolff
explained. ``It's like that extraordinary ending to Frank
O'Connor's short story `Guests of a Nation.' The last lines of the
story are something like, `Anything that happened afterwards, I
never felt the same about it again.' I want to write narratives in
which that happens. The world is one way before and one way
after.''
   Wolff was born in Los Angeles in 1937 and, like Nathaniel,
traveled East. But this was not by choice. As the author notes in
``Duke of Deception,'' his father was a notorious con man, racing
from city to city just out of reach of angry creditors.
   By the time Wolff was old enough to go to college, Princeton, he
had lived all over the country and was estranged from his mother -
his parents had separated - and his younger brother, Toby (author
Tobias Wolff, who wrote of his own childhood in ``This Boy's
Life'').
   In 1968, Geoffrey Wolff wrote his first novel, ``Bad Debts,'' a
story based on the relationship with his father, who died in 1970
after spending his final years in a sanitarium. Besides ``Duke of
Deception,'' Wolff has since written four novels and ``The Black
Sun,'' a bleak study of poet Harry Crosby.
   ``The Final Club'' takes Nathaniel through his years at
Princeton, offering judgments on fraternities, writers and the
elitist student body, and into a troubled marriage.
   The origin of the book's title keeps shifting. At first, it's an
alternative club Nathaniel forms with his Princeton friends, the
name coming from a card game in which you can be defeated by
holding the final club.
   But the world changes and the title eventually means something
much deeper. ``That was the final club,'' Nathaniel thinks when he
learns of a death in his family. ``Everyone was a member, not
exclusive in the least, all comers were goers.''
   The book ends at the beginning, with Nathaniel looking ahead to
the next time he can ponder ``The Final Club.'' He's a middle-aged
man who knows his life will never be the same, so all he can do is
what Wolff aims for himself, behave well to others and try to
maintain his capacity for wonder.
   ``He has, to a degree, an obsession about time passing,'' Wolff
said. ``It's like that wonderful line Burt Lancaster delivers in
`Atlantic City.' He looks out over the boardwalk and says, `When I
was a boy, there was a real ocean.' It's a line that breaks your
heart.''

<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a genre of music replete with songs
about rebellious drinking and infidelity, Don Williams is downright
counterculture.
   His songs are positive love ballads that also often glorify home
and family.
   So it's no surprise that Don Williams' new album is titled
``True Love,'' and it's the typical Williams form: soothing,
uncluttered, restrained. The LP maintains Williams' 15-year
tradition as something of a country music paradox. He sings
uplifting love songs, such as ``I Believe in You,'' ``You're My
Best Friend'' and ``We Should Be Together.''
   But don't expect him to play the new LP at his home on a 90-acre
ranch in neighboring Cheatham County where he lives quietly and
reclusively with his wife of 30 years. The 51-year-old Williams has
a detached attitude toward his music once it's recorded, rarely
listening to his songs.
   ``I think I've got a pretty good idea of what I've done after
I've finished it,'' he said in a rare interview. ``I'm so critical
of what I do that it's just never been a part of the picture to sit
around and relax with what I've done.
   ``I don't watch the (music popularity) charts. Unless someone
tells me what the sales are, I don't know. Because that's history.
I've done that. I'm always thinking more about what I'm going to do
than what I've done.''
   He doesn't even know if his LP ``I Believe in You'' was a
million seller. And there's also no need for adulation from fans.
   ``I don't think I'm the kind of person who'd go nuts if I didn't
have another standing ovation or wasn't on stage to hear that
applause,'' he said.
   ``The thing I've constantly been concerned about is I don't want
to whip a dead horse. I'm more than willing to step aside if the
folks out there reach a point where they've had enough of me.
   ``As long as they want me to do it, I'll do it. But I don't want
to force the issue.''
   About his only concession to the country music lifestyle is a
weather-beaten cowboy hat, one of four he owns, that's constantly
perched on his head. ``I kid about it turning into a growth,'' he
said.
   Williams has had five gold albums (sales of 500,000 each):
``Greatest Hits Volume 1,'' ``Expressions,'' ``The Best of Don
Williams Volume 11,'' ``Portraits'' and ``I Believe in You.''
   He has had concerts at Carnegie Hall in New York City, Royal
Albert Hall in London and the Sporting Club in Monte Carlo among
others. He has made international appearances in Belgium, Monaco,
Germany, Spain, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, France, Sweden, England,
Holland and Finland.
   He credits his popularity overseas to the universality of his
music.
   ``It's universal as to how we feel about each other and what our
needs in life are. Most of what I talk about is people and how they
react to people,'' he said.
   Williams also had a brief motion picture career in the 1970s,
appearing in two Burt Reynolds' films: ``W.W. &amp; the Dixie
Dancekings'' and ``Smokey &amp; the Bandit II.'' He'd like to do more
film work.
   Williams, a member of the Pozo Seco Singers pop-folk trio in the
1960s, has never been involved in even a whisper of controversy
despite his high visibility as one of country music's top
performers since the mid-1970s.
   ``I'm so bland I'm amazed people want to do interviews with
me,'' he said. ``We live a pretty simple life. And that's our
preference. We don't do a whole lot. We go to church and we were
involved in school activities when our kids were in school.''
   The first single released from ``True Love'' is ``Back in My
Younger Days,'' an uptempo song about the joy of getting older.
   Another cut, ``Lord Have Mercy on a Country Boy,'' is a
nostalgic piece about yearning to return to the dirt-road life of
hunting wild turkeys and fishing.
   In the song, Williams laments that a former meadow is now a
parking lot. For him, it's a rare reflection on a topical issue
such as the environment.
   ``I haven't been given too much to that - the political, the
religious. But I do have very strong feelings about it.''

   Add Barbara Hershey's voice to the growing
chorus of actresses who support Meryl Streep's attack on sex
discrimination in the movie business.
   Streep launched the campaign in August when she addressed the
first women's conference sponsored by the Screen Actors Guild. She
assailed movie moguls who produce a preponderance of male-oriented
films and pay actresses far less than actors.
   ``Meryl has come out with a lot of frightening statistics, such
as 23 percent of womens' roles vs. 79 percent for men,'' said
Hershey. ``When (women) hit 40, it's 6 percent. Those are pretty
scary - unhealthy - statistics. Certainly unfriendly.
   ``And the money factor: Men get twice as much as women. That's a
little more nebulous because in an acting career it' very hard to
measure someone's worth.''
   Hershey said that she didn't work as much as she would like.
``It's the quality. There are just so few quality pieces to work
on. And you have to be lucky to get one.''

   NEW YORK (AP) - Hugh Masekela, musician, composer and human
rights activist, leads a celebration for the 45th Anniversary of
the United Nations on Dec. 10 at the UN Delegate's Dining Room.
   Masekela and his African Orchestra will be sharing their
high-spirited music at the gala benefit sponsored by The Friends of
the UN, a non-profit, non-governmental organization, in honor of
the 45 years of service that the United Nations has provided on
behalf of peace, justice and the environment.
   Masekela began his career over 30 years ago when he became a

   Stock and bond prices climbed steeply and oil
prices plummeted after comments by President Bush led to renewed
hope of a peaceful end to the Iraqi stalemate.
   Oil plunged more than $4 per barrel Friday in its second-largest
one-day move since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   The biggest was a $5.41 drop Oct. 22, when traders sold on a
rumor that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had a dream in which a
prophet told him his missiles were pointed the wrong way.

raising the deposit insurance premiums banks pay to the fund,
imposing a one-time assessment on all banks, and requiring banks to
purchase preferred stock from the FDIC.

<HEAD>Leading Temp Agency's Survey Predicts Big Decline In Hiring Plans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Hiring plans of U.S. companies will drop steeply to recession
levels in the first quarter of 1991, particularly in the
economically battered Northeast, the world's largest temporary help
firm says it found in a srvey.
   Manpower Inc. said Sunday its sampling of more than 15,000
American businesses showed that 15 percent plan to increase hiring
while 16 percent plan to reduce their workforces, for a net hiring
drop of 1 percent.
   The firm said the net drop is the first shown by the survey
since the first quarter of 1983, when the nation was still emerging
from the last recession.
   Manpower said the 15 percent of firms intending to hire compares
with 20 percent for the same period in 1990. The 16 percent
planning work force cuts compares with 12 percent year earlier.
   The survey substantiated a number of other recently released
private and government statistical evidence that suggests the
nation is sliding into a recession or already is immersed in one.
   Mitchell Fromstein, Manpower president, said the survey figures
clearly show hiring activity is reaching recession depths in all
regions except the Midwest and is reflected in all business
categories.
   Although the first quarter of any year historically is a time of
low hiring activity, Fromstein said that even on a seasonally
adjusted basis the hiring predicions for the quarter are down
sharply.
   The survey showed the deterioration to be most evident in the
Northeast, where symptoms of recession have grown since the stock
market crash of 1987.
   The net hiring prediction for the area showed a net drop of 9
percent, vs. a 3 percent advance a year earlier. It is the lowest
in the 15 year history of the survey and well below the recession
levels of 1982-83.
   By industry, the survey showed the steepest declines in hiring
plans were in the construction and retail trade sectors. The survey
showed a 9 percent advance in hiring plans in the service category,
which suggested service jobs will account for much of the total
U.S. job increase activity through early next year.
   Manpower, based in Milwaukee, is the leading supplier of
temporary help to businesses worldwide, providing jobs to nearly
1.5 million people annually through more than 1,600 offices in 34
countries.
   It conducts the employment outlook survey on a quarterly basis,
measuring employer intentions to increase or decrease the permanent
workforce.

<HEAD>Report: Agents Seize Airline's Maintenance Records</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal agents have seized records of Eastern
Airlines as part of an investigation into allegations that the
troubled carrier failed to adequately inspect its airplanes for
safety as recently as early November, according to a published
report.
   Thirty federal agents entered Eastern's Miami headquarters on
Saturday after lawyers for Eastern unsuccessfully tried to block
the raid, Newsday reported Sunday.
   The seizure of hundreds of safety logs is tied to indictments
against Eastern handed down last July by a federal grand jury in
Brooklyn, the newspaper reported. The charges allege that the
airline and nine of its former and current managers participated in
a money-making scheme that allowed unsafe planes to fly.
   The grand jury has received evidence that Eastern failed to
perform safety inspections properly as recently as early last
month, Newsday said, citing unidentified sources.
   An Eastern spokeswoman, Karen Ceremsak, said there have been
allegations about the airline's safety inspections in the past and
``none of those have ever borne out.''
   ``The fact the (search) warrant was so broad indicates to us
that they're simply on a fishing expedition, that they're not
seeking records that relate to specific allegations,'' she added.
   The indictments were based on testimony from informants. The
raid was the first seizure of documents under search warrants
authorities obtained for Eastern's records, Newsday said.
   Newsday said U.S. Attorney Andrew J. Maloney, who is heading the
investigation, declined to comment on the report of the raid.
   Eastern attorneys who had somehow learned of the impending raid
went before U.S. District Judge I. Leo Glasser in Brooklyn late
Friday asking him to stay the seizure. Glasser agreed to seal the
affidavits supporting the government's plans for one week, but let
the raid go forward, Newsday said.
   Eastern has been operating under protection of U.S. bankruptcy
laws since last March. It received a temporary reprieve last week
when the bankruptcy judge overseeing the case agreed to the
airline's request to use up to $135 million from an escrow fund to
keep flying through the winter.

<TEXT>
   World trade officials opened a final
round of global trade talks today with a blunt reminder that the
economic health of millions was riding on the outcome of their
bargaining.
   ``The world is expecting a great deal of you,'' Belgian Prime
Minister Wilfried Martens told the delegates from nations attending
the negotiating session of the 107-nation Uruguay Round, the most
ambitious trade talks ever.
   ``Failure would deal world trade stability a nasty blow and
would seriously harm the world economy,'' he said at the Heysel
Palaces exhibition complex on the outskirts of the Belgian capital.
   Trade officials said 1,650 officials from 96 nations were in
attendance to launch the week of bargaining, which has been
threatened with failure by an acrimonious fight over cuts in
government payments to farmers.
   The dispute has pitted the European Community and Japan against
the United States, Australia, and others.
   Today, the United States formally warned it may impose
``prohibitive'' tariffs on some imports from the European Community
unless the EC agrees to renew an accord on compensation for
potential losses of U.S. farm exports to Spain and Portugal.
   U.S. trade officials said the move could cost the 12-nation
community almost $420 million in exports.
   Thousands of farmers, mostly Europeans, marched through Brussels
to show their opposition to any move to trim their support
payments.
   The negotiations, which began in 1986 in the Uruguayan resort of
Punta del Este, are designed to lower barriers to trade in 15
areas, including agriculture, textiles, manufactured goods and
services, such as banking, transportation, telecommunications and
construction.
   Indonesia's trade minister, Arifin Siregar, complained today
that rich nations were hindering work on an overall agreement.
   ``With a few days left in the Uruguay Round, we are being
confronted with a crisis situation, mainly attributed to roadblocks
put up by the majors,'' he told the opening session.
   He said if the problems were not solved quickly, ``It would not
be an exaggeration to say that the decay of the multilateral
trading system has begun.''
   Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama, whose nation is being
pressed by the United States and others to lift its ban on rice
imports, called for a ``realistic solution'' to agricultural
disputes. Japan argues that its ban on rice imports is essential to
give the country self-sufficiency in its staple food.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter met Sunday with trade
officials from the European Community and Japan but reported no
progress.
   On on the eve of the talks, officials stressed repeatedly that
ending the fight over agriculture was key to a successful
conclusion of the round.
   ``The impasse there is poisoning other parts of the round,''
said Australian Trade Minister Neal Blewett, chairman of the Cairns
Group of 14 farm-exporting nations.
   The Bush administration, backed by Australia, Argentina, Brazil
and others, wants the European Community to snip away much of its
costly farm support system, making cuts ranging from 75 percent to
90 percent. But the Europeans have refused to budge from a 30
percent cut in limited areas.
   Ray MacSharry, the EC's top farm official, however, told
reporters that ``there is substantial common ground'' in some areas
of negotiation.
   France and Germany have been the community's main opponents to
further reductions. But there is speculation that the Germans, who
had been anxious about the farm vote prior to Sunday's elections,
might give in some now that the balloting is over.
   Blewett predicted the farm issue would ``come to a head'' in the
first two days of the conference.
   On another dispute, officials reported some progress in an
effort to write new rules for trade in various service industries
such as banking and insurance.
   Canadian Trade Minister John Crosbie said his country, with the
support of several other nations, was expected to offer a proposal
for removing barriers to trade in financial services. He said the
measure has the support of the United States and the Common Market.
   The Uruguay Round is the eighth in a series of negotiating
sessions designed to reduce tariffs and lower barriers to global
trade. The negotiations are sponsored by the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, which was created in 1947 as a forum and an
agreement to freer world trade.

   Swissair and Singapore Airlines are

   The two airlines established an alliance last December that

Singapore will obtain a 2.77 percent holding in Swissair.

<HEAD>EEOC To Accept `Tester' Complaints of Job Discrimination</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government will begin prosecuting
job discrimination cases in which individuals used as ``testers''
by civil rights groups charge they have been illegally denied
employment, an official says.
   The new policy extends the use of testers - long a tactic in
housing discrimination complaints - to the federal employment bias
arena for the first time.
   ``It's used in housing cases and used by other state agencies,
and I couldn't see why it couldn't be used by the commission,''
Evan J. Kemp Jr., chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission, said in a telephone interview Sunday.
   ``Testers'' - or individuals from minority and women's groups
who historically have been victims of discrimination - have posed
as renters or home buyers to win housing discrimination suits.
   The Supreme Court in 1982 said such activities were legal even
if the testers did not intend to rent or buy.
   However, the government never has used the testimony of testers
to prosecute job discrimination cases.
   Kemp said the new commission policy, announced Friday, would
address one of the ``weaknesses'' of the EEOC system.
   ``People that apply for a job in answer to a newspaper ad can be
discriminated against and they won't know it,'' under current
circumstances, Kemp said.
   The EEOC chairman said he was confident his agency has the legal
authority to bring the cases because the ``courts address this all
the time and make a determination whether an employer has
discriminated or not.''
   Representatives of the business community could not be reached
for comment Sunday on the new policy.
   But Stephen Bokat of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce told The
Washington Post that ``proving the case'' of job bias against an
employment tester would be ``infinitely more difficult than it is
in the housing context.''

information and analysis on foreign companies as readily available
as it is for domestic concerns.
   Under the arrangement, which Donovan said was a combination of
cash and assets, Wright's corporate research center in Shannon,
Ireland, will provide material for marketing by Disclosure, a
Bethesda, Md. data distributor.
   Steven Goldspiel, Disclosure president and chief executive
officer, said the addition of Wright's Worldscope database would
make it the largest single-source provider of domestic and
international corporate information.
   He said the easier access to foreign financial information and
analysis was essential to chief executives and investment advisers
who increasingly are operating in an international business and
economic environment.
   The new product, called Worldscope-Disclosure, will be available
immediately through online information systems, compact discs,
magnetic tapes and published periodicals.
   The Worldscope database is the information source for Wright's
financial services business, which includes 28 domestic and
international mutual funds, the administration of 40 bank trust
departments, and various advisory products and services. It has
about $3.5 billion under management worldwide.
   In 1988, the company established its Shannon-based global
research center to gather, translate and analyze corporate
financial information. The center is staffed with more than 60
international analysts.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, with no major
developments influencing supply and demand.
   Wheat futures were slightly higher, soybeans fractionally lower
and corn futures narrowly mixed.
   Victor Lespinasse, an assistant vice president in the
grain-trading division of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said
supportive factors included expectations that the Bush
administration will announce a package of food export credits for
the Soviet Union on Thursday.
   Lespinasse said a turn to colder conditions in the Midwest could
result in stronger demand for livestock feed, a bullish development
for the corn and soybean meal markets.
   On the bearish side were perceptions that world trade talks in
Belgium will break down, possibly leading to a U.S.-European trade
war that could include grain, he said.
   In early trading, wheat futures were { cent to 2\ cents higher
with the contract for delivery in December at $2.46 a bushel; corn
was \ cent lower to 1{ cents higher with December at $2.29\ a
bushel; oats were { cent lower to 1 cent higher with December at
$1.13 a bushel; soybeans were \ cent to 4 cents lower with January
at $5.89\ a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mixed and pork futures were lower in early
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .05 cent to .20 cent higher with December at
78.72 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent lower to .20 cent
higher with January at 87.45 cents a pound; live hogs were .15 cent
lower to .35 cent higher with December at 51.25 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .10 cent to 1.20 cents higher with
February at 66.80 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures fell on Friday; pork futures were mixed.

   Stock prices pushed higher today, although an
early rally lost some of its steam.
   The Dow Jones industrial average, which rose 40.84 points on
Friday, was up 3.96 points at 2,563.61 as of noontime on Wall
Street. It had been up by about 16 points near the opening.
   Advancing issues were ahead of decliners by a margin of 4 to 3,
with 822 up, 563 down and 477 unchanged on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   Big Board volume totaled 83.24 million shares as of noon on Wall
Street compared with 71.94 million shares at the same point on
Friday.
   Analysts said the market opened strongly in the wake of gains on
overseas markets and in bond futures trading overnight.
   There was continuing hope that the Bush administration's offer
to discuss the Middle East crisis with Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein might avert a war.
   The rise in the Dow Jones average was held in check by AT&amp;T,
which fell 2&lsqb; to 30 after offering to acquire NCR Corp. in a $6
billion stock swap. AT&amp;T was the most-actively traded issue on the
NYSE this morning.
   NCR was the second most active, surging 25{ to 82\. The AT&amp;T
offer was $90 a share.
   Elsewhere in the technology sector, Digital Equipment was up 2{
at 54\ and IBM was up &rsqb; at 114.
   There was mixed evidence today on the state of the economy.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management said its
purchasing managers index, a closely-followed economic indicator,
continued to tumble in November, falling to 41.3 percent from 43.4
percent in October.
   The decline indicated a further weakening in manufacturing and
the overall economy.
   But the government said construction spending increased 1.3
percent in October, the first gain in three months. The advance was
due in large part to new school and sewer projects as spending on
residential and non-residential buildings continued to fall.
   Among active issues on the NYSE, Pepsico was up &rsqb; at 26, Philip
Morris was up &lsqb; at 48}, Limited was up 1&rsqb; at 17&lsqb; and General
Electric was up | to 54}.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed stocks rose 0.68 to

0.16 to 301.95.

   The number of working oil and gas rigs in the
United States remained unchanged this week at 1,175, following a
healthy rebound the week before, Baker Hughes Inc. reported Monday.
   The number of rigs had plummeted by 41 in late November,
following heavy rains in Oklahoma, then rebounded last week by 72
as weather improved and the end-of-year seasonal upturn began. A
year ago this week, the number of working rigs was 1,062.
   Decreases in the previous weeks followed a milestone earlier in
the month when the number of working rigs reached 1,144 - a figure
not seen since Dec. 28, 1987.
   Baker Hughes has kept track of the rig count - the widely
watched index of drilling activity - since 1940. The count
represents the number of rigs actively exploring for oil, not those
producing oil.
   At the height of the oil boom in December 1981, the count
reached a peak of 4,500. But the rig count plunged to a low of 663
after oil prices collapsed in the summer of 1986.
   Oklahoma led the major oil producing states for the week, adding
13 rigs to the count, followed by Pennsylvania, which added six;
Michigan, which added 2; and North Dakota and Ohio, which each
added one.
   Louisiana led the states reporting losses for the week, with
nine fewer working rigs. Louisiana was followed by Texas, whose
count dropped by 8; Wyoming and Colorado, which each lost two rigs;
and California and Kansas, whose counts each dropped by one.
   New Mexico's count remained unchanged for the week.

   Visa U.S.A. has imposed a moratorium on
issuing memberships to new applicants from non-banking companies.
   Visa said the six-month moratorium was a ``prudent measure''
while it reviews Visa membership eligibility in general.
Institutions not eligible to join Visa directly would not be
allowed to join indirectly by merging or acquiring a member company
without the approval of Visa's board, the company said.
   The membership freeze, annouced on Friday, is Visa's latest step
to soothe bankers disturbed by the success of their non-bank rivals
in winning part of the valuable credit-card market, particularly
the success of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s Universal card.
   Visa in October announced tight rules on so-called affinity
programs. Under those programs, non-financial organizations can
issue cards under contract with a financial institution. The
Universal card is sold under a relationship with Universal Bank in
Atlanta.
   Under the new rules, affinity cards cannot be used to access any
account that isn't maintained by a financial institution that
issues Visa cards.

   The Patent and Trademark Office today
recognized an aroma as a subject for trademark registration for the
first time. It granted a trademark to the scent of a line of
embroidery yarns and threads.
   The office approved registration of a scent described by its
developer, Celia Clarke of Goleta, Calif., as ``a high-impact,
fresh floral fragrance reminiscent of plumeria blossoms.''
   Ms. Clarke's application was initially turned down on grounds
the product's fragrance did not qualify for a trademark. The ruling
was overturned on Sept. 19 by the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board.
   ``This marks the first time in the history of trademarks that a
fragrance has been approved for registration,'' said Jeffrey M.
Samuels, assistant commissioner for trademarks. ``We are all
familiar with what trademarks look like. Now we'll see what they
smell like.''
   Approval of the registration was published in today's Trademark
Official Gazette. Members of the public have 30 days in which to
oppose registration. If no opposition is filed, the registration
will be issued on Feb. 26.
   More than one million trademarks have been registered since the
first trademark law was passed in 1870. About 600,000 of them are
still in use. A trademark registration lasts 10 years and can be
renewed indefinitely.
   David Sams, chairman of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board,
said Ms. Clarke and her associates maintained that the fragrance
``was in fact the trademark by which their product could be
distinguished from other people's thread and yarn.''
   Sams said the board's reasoning in granting the application was
that there was no natural fragrance to yarn and no evidence that
``it was a common practice or a practice of anybody else at all in
the industry, to make their yarn scented so that it stood out and
was distinctive to this particular producer of yarn.''
   He said the board said in a footnote to its decision that it was
not passing any judgment on ``registerability of a scent or
fragrance on products which are noted for those features, like
perfumes and household products. We left for another day whether a
party could register a particular scent for a product sold for its
scent.''
   ``We are here talking about an unusual application of a scent to
a product,'' Sams said.
   Ms. Clarke, reached by telephone in Goleta, said the firm, a
manufacturer of punch embroidery needles, has been in business 15
years. She said the application for trademark was submitted about
two years ago, when the company began producing the scented yarn.
   ``We are a small company, so we haven't done a big lot with it,
although we do intend to,'' she said. ``I think we will really push
it now and show it more,'' she said.

<HEAD>Ask For Total Ban on Tobacco Ads; Reject Milder Measure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Community Commission, at
the request of several member states, will soon propose a total ban
on tobacco ads on billboards and in the print media, officials said
Monday.
   The request for a total ban came after the 12 EC health
ministers, at a meeting here, rejected a proposal to toughen curbs
on tobacco ads in nations with relatively lax rules on such
advertising.
   Sources said Germany, Britain and the Netherlands argued the
proposal would not harmonize tobacco advertising rules across the
EC as France, Italy and Spain already have complete bans.
   ``The current proposal has lived its day and died,'' said
Italian Health Minister Franco De Lorenzo, who chaired the meeting.
   ``This will not be reanimated.''
   The measure that was rejected envisaged strict controls on the
content of tobacco ads in the print media and on billboards and
offered a choice of 14 specific health warnings.
   All EC nations ban tobacco commercials on television and three
ban tobacco ads from the print media.
   ``All delegations agree that it is necessary to take measures to
reduce tobacco consumption,'' De Lorenzo told reporters.

   The dollar soared against other major currencies
in Europe today, boosted by a Japanese news report of a planned
financial summit about the American currency, and later by comments
from the U.S. Treasury Department.
   Gold prices fell.
   The Treasury's comments, included in its twice-yearly report to
Congress on international economic and exchange rate policy,
stressed the government's desire to see the U.S. trade deficit
improved by fundamental economic factors rather than through a weak
dollar.
   Dealers said the statement refocused attention on growing
speculation that the so-called Group of Seven industrialized
democracies might reaffirm their commitment to maintaining a stable
dollar.
   The G-7 nations are the United States, Britain, France, Germany,
Japan, Italy and Canada.
   The Kyodo News Agency report, quoting unidentified Japanese
sources, said a G-7 meeting was planned in January, and sparked a
flurry of buying.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.9205 from $1.9400 late
Friday. Later in New York trading, the pound fetched $1.9163.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.25 yen to a closing 133.00 yen.
Later in London it was quoted at a higher rate of 134.35 yen. In
midday New York trading, the dollar fetched 134.61 yen.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe compared with late Friday:
1.5125 German marks, up from 1.4990; 1.2915 Swiss francs, up from
1.2760; 5.1113 French francs, up from 5.0630; 1.7055 Dutch

   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $380.50 a troy ounce
from $382.25 bid per ounce late Friday.
   In Zurich, the metal fell to a closing bid of $380.85, down from

<HEAD>Judge Tightens Bail Conditions to Avoid `Phone Tag' with
Prosecutors</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A judge on Monday tightened the terms of bail
for indicted financier Charles H. Keating Jr., after prosecutors
complained that the former Lincoln Savings and Loan owner couldn't
be found over the Thanksgiving weekend.
   Superior Court Judge Lance Ito ordered the district attorney's
office and Keating's attorneys to set up a schedule specifying the
day and hour at which Keating can be reached by telephone each
week.
   The order differs from one set earlier by a federal judge by
establishing the specific time for a call.
   ``That way you don't have to play phone tag with each other,''
Ito said.
   Keating, free on $300,000 bail, is charged with 46 counts of
fraud alleging he misled investors into believing that high-yield,
high-risk bonds issued by the Lincoln parent American Continental
Corp. were safe. The indictment says buyers, many of them elderly
people investing their life savings, lost some $200 million.
   The bonds became worthless in April 1989, when American
Continental sought bankruptcy protection. Lincoln was seized the
following day by federal regulators. Experts say its failure will
cost taxpayers $2 billion, the largest savings and loan bailout to
date.
   Ito postponed until Jan. 11 discussion of an amended indictment
that revises 20 of 42 original counts against Keating and adds four
counts.
   The case is scheduled to go to trial Feb. 3, but Deputy District
Attorney William Hodgman said that date probably would be postponed
until spring.
   In documents filed Friday, Keating's attorneys said their client
could not be located during the Thanksgiving weekend because he had
changed his home phone number in the Phoenix area to an unlisted
number.
   Conditions of bail set by U.S. District Judge John Davies
required Keating to be available for a weekly phone call from the
district attorney's office, but did not set a specific time.
   Hodgman said Keating violated the orders of bail by not advising
his office of the new number.
   ``We want to know where Mr. Keating is,'' Hodgman said. ``Mr.
Keating's got to play by the same rules as any other defendant.''
   Keating appeared for the hearing but declined to talk to
reporters.
   His attorney, Stephen Neal, criticized the Senate Ethics
Committee, which has been conducting hearings into the relationship
between Keating and five senators, for declining to grant Keating
immunity in exchange for testimony.
   Neal said it was impossible for the committee to learn the truth
without hearing from Keating.
   ``It is far more important that the committee gets to the bottom
of what is going on with campaign contributions than the ability or
inability of the federal government to prosecute anybody,'' Neal
said.

   Shopping mall patrons across the land are

   With Christmas shoppers breathing down their necks, the people
who run the nation's almost 35,000 shopping centers have an eye out
these days for the droves of teen-agers whose high jinks sometimes
explode in violence and whose presence sometimes intimidates other
shoppers.
   About a dozen shopping centers and malls have gone so far as to
ban teen-agers entirely at critical hours.
   And even those that haven't are looking for ways to cope with
youngsters who have adopted the comfortable and elegant mall
surroundings as second homes.
   At its fall meeting in Kansas City, Mo., the International
Council of Shopping Centers held a seminar titled ``Hanging Out:
Whose Shopping Mall Is It Anyway?''
   At McKinley Mall in Hamburg, N.Y., 15 miles from Buffalo, no one
under 20 is allowed inside between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. on Fridays
and Saturdays, unless they are reporting for work or are
accompanied by an adult.
   The mall took the action after an estimated 600 teens inundated
the mall's food court one Friday night and a fight in the parking
lot spilled over into the common area.
   At the Randall Park Mall in North Randall, Ohio, the operators
don't allow unescorted teens at any hour. Even teen-agers going to
the theater must be brought and picked up.
   Omaha's Park Fair has banned people under 18.
   Beyond those shopping centers which have banned teens, far more
have reported trouble controlling teen crowds that clog common
areas, block store entrances and generally, if inadvertently,
intimidate customers.
   But banning teens has also posed an ironic conflict. Teens are
good customers. They spend a lot of money.
   Mall operators say the problems stem from changes in the
community, a growing number of two-income latchkey families and the
cuts made in school budgets, leaving the teens no place to go when
the closing bell rings. They are a new kind of temporarily
homeless, and the mall is a haven.
   The scene at Aurora Mall, outside Denver, Colo., this Christmas
is a study in contrast to a year ago.
   This year there are teen-age advisory boards at all eight high
schools in the mall's neighborhood, and each of these sends a
representative to a super advisory board that meets once a month at
the mall.
   These youngsters, with adult advisors drawn from the community,
help devise programs that can help revise adult perceptions about
teen-agers.
   So this Christmas they will field Customer Service Ambassadors,
drawn from the high schools, who will help adult customers with
their parcels, with directions to shops, and try to change adult
attitudes to the teen-age presence. There will also be teen-agers
available at the mall to wrap Christmas presents for customers.
   Consider last year. Mall operators began to notice a growing
number of youngsters in the spring of 1989. Susan Keene, general
manager, says they were congregating in large groups, ``acting out
in loud fashion'' and otherwise horsing around. ``We started
receiving complaints from our adult shoppers'' on Mondays following
the weekends.
   ``So in order to get rid of the problem and get rid of it fast,
we instituted a get-tough policy in the fall of 1989. It was a kind
of steamroller approach.''
   Youngsters were handed wallet-sized cards with rules of behavior
on them - no behavior likely to cause a disturbance, no sitting on
planter walls, no alcoholic beverages, no blocking store entrances.
After two weeks notice, they were given one warning and then
photographed and banned. Recalcitrants were arrested by local
police and charged with trespass.
   The mall was banning 10 to 15 youngsters every Saturday.
   But it didn't work. There was no decrease in teen-agers coming
to the mall. Harassment was not the answer. Furthermore, the mall
became the target of a boycott and pickets from the black
community, which perceived the tactic as being aimed at their
children.
   ``While only about 20 percent of Aurora Mall shoppers were
African-American,'' says manager Keene, ``about 75 percent of the
kids who come to the mall are African-American.''
   Clearly something else had to be done. The mall began with a
marketing survey, intercepting youngsters and holding discussion
groups to find out just who they were. What they found was
something of a surprise.

   The teens and their parents, they discovered, had a sense of
ownership of the mall, even though it was private property. They
felt it was their right to congregate there, not just to shop. The
youngsters came to be with their friends, to make dates, to find
out where the parties were, all of this in lieu of a school
environment which had suffered from budget cuts.
   The mall offered an elegant and inexpensive focus for the
youngsters, and in some cases a place they perceived as being safer
than their own neighborhoods. The youngsters, concerned about gang
activity in the community, saw the mall as safe haven.
   Stephen Huber, of a Cleveland firm that manages a number of
malls, says that on one occasion three teen gang members were
standing at an entrance to the mall when four members of a rival
gang drove by. The four turned the car around, got a running start,
jumped the curb and crashed into the entrance in an attempt to run
down their rivals.
   Oddly, gang activity is easier to deal with than the teen
problem, shopping center operators say, because the police know who
they are and what to do about them.
   Not so the average teens. The market survey showed that the
teens visited the Aurora Mall one to three times a week, visited an
average of 10 stores and spent an average of $64 a visit. Most of
them had sincere career aspirations, and in spite of their bizarre
dress and behavior were basically ``good kids.''
   So the mall operators set about changing their own mind-set, and
that of security people. Just because kids had intimidating
appearances and numbers, it didn't mean they were bad or that they
were any more bizarre than previous generations.
   The mall also hired a customer service director whose job is
more public relations than security, which also comes under his
purview. The accent is on politeness, requests to move on, or
please don't block the store front. It seems to be working.
   And the city of Aurora put a highly visible police mini-station
in the heart of the mall.
   There was a similar impasse at the Columbia Mall in Columbia,
S.C., where a heavy-handed approach eventually yielded to gentler
means. Without knowing it, the mall operator had used a strong but
old South Carolina law that permits the banning of people from
private property for six months under penalty of law.
   They used the law frequently, but then discovered it had been
passed as a tool for segregationists. There was a community uproar.
   Now the mall has a polite Customer Service Corps, neatly dressed
people in blazers and carrying radios and directories of stores.
They help customers with parcels, give directions, and act as new
sets of eyes and ears as they roam around the mall.
   The emergence of the mall as a prime community focal point has
been growing throughout the nation each year. The number of malls
and floor space has been growing about 7 percent a year, drawing
172.4 million adults, 70 percent of the population.
   Malls and shopping centers now number 34,683, and more than
1,500 new ones were started in 1989. One near Minneapolis plans to
house about 600 stores.
   So the teen problem can be expected to grow.
   Most expect teen banning to abate, however. Teens are a growing
$56 billion market, and this has not passed unnoticed.
   Bans quite naturally have alienated teens. At the McKinley Mall
in Hamburg, N.Y., 15-year-old Jan Harris says, ``A lot of kids who
are here are straight. The reason they turn away people is that
they're different.'' She was banned from the mall when she sat on a
bench to rest. ``Is that a valid reason to kick someone out?'' she
asked.
   By and large, McKinley merchants say, the ban has not affected
business as much as they feared.
   Ron Jefferson, who runs the Singing River Mall in Gautier,
Miss., which attracts as many as 200 teens on a weekend, has put in
an outside entrance to the game rooms to divert traffic. He has
also put in extra security and more phones at the theaters. On
visits to local schools he reminds teens that they are potential
mall employees as well as patrons.
   Malls have been havens for teen-agers almost from the beginning.
In fact mall owners took pains to attract them with movie theaters,
game rooms, record stores. The difference today is their sheer
numbers.
   Managers are trying innovations to attract teens. One offers
vacant space to a church group, which has set up drop-in
counseling. Another features fashion shows with high school
students as models.
   Says one manager, ``When I was a kid, I didn't have an American
Express card, but these kids do. They spend a lot of money here.''

<HEAD>Steel Importers Lash out Against ``Dumping'' Accusations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID E. KALISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Steel importers have taken a bad rap for
``dumping'' products in the United States when the real culprit is
volatility in world currency markets, a trade group said Monday.
   The American Institute for Imported Steel contended that the
price discrepancies often seen in foreign steel are in many
instances due to unpredictable changes in the dollar's value
against foreign currencies.
   In recent months the dollar has fluctuated dramatically on world
currenyy markets amid a weakening of the U.S economy and the
growing potential for war in the Persian Gulf.
   ``Under present anti-dumping rules throughout the world,
international traders can become targets of expensive litigation
for reasons entirely beyond their control,'' said John Griffin, the
institute's president, at a news conference in New York, where the
group was holding an annual meeting.
   ``Dumping'' is the practice of selling foreign goods at unfairly
low prices in order to grab a bigger share of the market. It is
considered a violation of import rules in the United States and
many other countries.
   There has been widespread concern in the steel industry about
what domestic producers call foreign dumping of steel in the United
States, once one of the world's mightiest steelmakers but now a
major importer.
   To remedy what it called a potentially serious problem, the
steel-import institute proposed an agreement under which
governments apply a 10-year average to exchange rates to be used in
calculating costs and prices.
   The proposal, an amendment to existing anti-dumping rules, would
``strengthen the law by sharpening focus on truly predatory acts of
international price discrimination unrelated to shifting exchange
rates,'' said Griffin.
   It was unclear if the proposal would win the necessary
international support. Backers hope to introduce it in negotiations
next year.
   Institute members said dumping accusations were worsening with
the dollar's recent plunge in value, which were increasing imported
steel's dollar value but not giving the price charged in the United
States enough time to catch up.
   As a result, steel importers are being accused of ``technical''
dumping in cases brought against them by U.S. steel manufacturers,
group members said.
   American companies brought roughly 395 cases against importers
between 1980 and 1989, a dramatic increase from earlier years, said
Kermit Almstedt, an attorney representing the trade group.
   Almstedt said he did not know how many of those lawsuits were
prompted by ``technical'' dumping but added, ``one of the reasons
you're seeing a lot of cases against the Japanese is a result of
the exchange rates.''
   Importers found charging unfairly low prices for their products
can be slapped with a tarrif equal to the difference between what
they charged and the product's perceived fair market price,
Almstedt said.
   Steel importers fear a big litigation problem in 1992 with
President Bush's planned lifting of the system of Voluntary
Restraint Agreements which for the past five years has curbed
imports of steel from most major supplying countries into the
United States.
   The potential for a subsequent flood of steel imports into the
United States could prompt a backlash from domestic steel
manufacturers, members said.

<HEAD>Powerful Central Bank Warns on Government Borrowing Plans</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS throughout to RECAST lead to emphasize call for spending
cuts, moves to 3rd graf quote from Poehl; no pickup. Also moving on
general news wires.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   In a post-election warning, the president of
Germany's powerful central bank said Monday that drastsic
government spending cuts are needed to offset the costs of
unification.
   Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said in a magazine
interview that the government plans to borrow too much money to
rebuild the crippled eastern part of the newly united nation.
   Poehl, whose comments were confirmed by the bank's press
department, said ``far reaching and drastic'' government spending
cuts were needed to offset the borrowing.
   Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, a director of the bank, also criticized
the government's plans.
   With Chancellor Helmut Kohl's election victory now history, from
bars to boardrooms Germans are returning to a main topic of
conversation: How much will it cost to bail out economically
backward eastern Germany?
   Among the possible ways to pay the massive bill are cutting
government spending or going further into debt. Neither is popular,
and either could eventually lead Kohl into trouble despite his
Sunday re-election.
   The influential news magazine Der Spiegel said the total
government debt could reach $860 billion by next year, leading to
worries that today's unification joy will become tomorrow's debts
for future generations.
   Estimates of how much it will cost to give eastern Germans a
Western standard of living reach into the hundreds of billions of
dollars.
   Eastern workers are anxious to have their salaries brought up to
Western levels, and a recent railroad strike could be a sign of
trouble to come.
   For now, Kohl's government plans to run up the national debt to
pay for unification bills.
   That decision drew Poehl's remarks. The central bank president
told Stern magazine that the government's plan to borrow between
$93 billion and $100 billion in 1991 ``was too high.''
   The growing deficit is driving up interest rates and thus
borrowing costs for ordinary Germans who want loans for cars, homes
and other items.
   Chancellor Kohl needs Poehl's backing to complete a full and
swift merger of capitalist western Germany with the formerly
Communist eastern part of the country. The Bundesbank president is
probably the single most important figure in guiding the economy in
this nation of 78 million people.
   During the summer, Poehl expressed reservations about Kohl's
plans to exchange much of East Germany's virtually worthless money
into West German marks at a 1-to-1 rate. Poehl later went along,
despite his misgivings.
   The Bundesbank is especially vigilant in monitoring German
monetary policy, keeping a special watch out for economic moves
that could drive up inflation.
   Gaddum, the Bundesbank director responsible for eastern Germany,
said Monday that officials don't understand repeated warnings about
the dangers of high government borrowing.
   ``When I look at the planned growth rates of the public budgets
for 1991, I have doubts whether the message has been understood,''
the director said in an interview on Germany's ARD television
network.
   The comments from the two Bundesbank officials could cause
trouble for Kohl, under increasing criticism for planning to borrow
too much.
   Finance Minister Theo Waigel has said the borrowing will be
raised only to the point justifiable by German unification.
   ``Then, in the course of medium-term financial planning we have
to reduce the debt again, so that the repayment of interest and
principal don't become too great later on,'' Waigel said on
election night.
   Oskar Lafontaine, the unsuccessful candidate for chancellor from
the Social Democratic Party, has repeatedly accused Kohl of
slipshod financial planning for the Oct. 3 German merger.

<HEAD>Passengers Unfazed, Employees Don't Say Much</HEAD>

   Employees were low-key and passengers seemed
mostly oblivious Monday after the parent of Continental Airlines
filed for protection under federal bankruptcy laws for the second
time in seven years.
   ``I'm not worried as long as I can get home today,'' Gwendolyn
Currie, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., said.
   Her flight to New Orleans was detoured to Houston because of bad
weather and she was among the crowd waiting for Continental flights
at Houston Intercontinental Airport's Terminal C, the Houston-based
airline's main hub.
   ``I just hope to get out of here today,'' she said.
   ``I hope I still have a way to get back,'' said Frank Dow, who
was heading to Lafayette, La., from Houston.
   Some Continental employees were handed a printed message about
the filing when they reported to work Monday morning and a text of
the announcement was made availabletto others on computer monitors
at passenger check-in gates.
   Passenger reaction to the announcement was minimal, gate
attendants said, probably because so few people knew of it. The
airline company said it intended to run normally despite the
Chapter 11 filing in a federal bankruptcy court in Delaware, where
Continental is incorporated.
   ``The impact is zero,'' said one flight officer, who declined to
be identified, saying employees are told to not speak with
reporters. ``It's business as usual.
   ``Look around,'' he said, pointing to aircraft taxiing and
passengers boarding. ``I don't have any anxiety.''
   ``This is something external, with the fuel prices,'' a flight
attendant with him said. ``It's all out of our control and there's
very little I can do. I think it's important the public recognizes
this is an administrative action. That's what's important. If you
didn't watch the news, you would never know.''
   The flight officer, who said he went through the 1983 bankruptcy
filing when flights were halted, employees laid off and passengers
stranded, noted the chaos of that time was absent on Monday.
   ``It's very relaxed,'' he said. ``This was a whole different
background.''
   Capt. Robert Finley, a senior pilot at Continental, said he was
among four top pilots to meet with airline chairman and president
Hollis Harris on Thursday to discuss the situation.
   ``Continental Airlines is going to wind up surviving and being a
leader in the industry,'' Finley said. ``Mr. Harris is a very
positive, people-oriented person which is something we haven't
known a lot of around Continental for awhile.
   ``It seems like a breath of fresh air to see a man like him in
that job. If anyone can pull us through these difficult times -
where fuel costs are skyrocketing and all costs are elevating at an
enormous rate while the fares are still being depressed and the
fare wars are going on - I think Mr. Harris is the guy who can do
it.''
   Finley said he was not nervous about his future.
   ``I went through the last one,'' he said. ``That one made me
nervous. But this I feel is necessary and is a positive move to
strengthen the company so we can move forward.''
   ``If I was an employee, I'd really be concerned,'' passenger
Robert Cloud of Houston said.
   Cloud was a reluctant Continental passenger and was sent to the
airline on Monday by United Airlines when his United flight was
canceled.
   ``I had heard they were having problems,'' he said while waiting
to fly to San Francisco and then Bangkok. ``It's one of those
hazards.''
   ``I can just go to another airline,'' said Archie Buchanan,
flying to Phoenix. ``Filing Chapter 11 doesn't normally mean you're
going to quit flying - at least for the short term.''
   ``I think we're too tired right now to worry,'' Beverly Zigal,
of Austin, who was heading for Belize, Central America.
``Hopefully, we'll get back. It'll be interesting to see what
transpires in the next few days. I hope it hits the newspapers down
there but we'll be off on some remote island fishing.''
   ``As long as we get there, we'll probably get back,'' added her
companion, Jane Bessent.
   ``I've been through it three times before with other carriers,''
said one Continental flight officer, who refused to provide his
name but said he was based in Newark. `You position yourself. It's
a little bit of a surprise and it's kind of strange to hear this
from a reporter.''

   The retiring chairman and chief executive of the
New York Stock Exchange, John J. Phelan Jr., will join the board of
brokerage giant Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. on Jan. 1, the investment firm
announced Monday.
   Phelan announced earlier this year he would step down at the end

through its most tumultuous period that included the market crash
in 1987.
   He is being succeeded at the NYSE by William H. Donaldson.
   Before being elected chairman and chief executive at the NYSE in
May 1984, Phelan was its president and chief operating officer from
1980 to 1984.
   Phelan has been associated with the securities industry for 35
years. He becomes the 17th member on the Merrill Lynch board.
   Merrill Lynch is the nation's biggest brokerage company with $14
billion in annual revenue and 10,500 brokers.

<HEAD>Surging Soybeans Boost Crop Futures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A strong rally in the soybean and soybean product
markets helped lift grain futures prices to a higher close Monday
on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   The surge began in the soybean oil pit after a large number of
delivery notices were cancelled, indicating soybean oil supplies
for delivery against the December contract may be tighter than
previously thought.
   Steve Freed, grains analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in
Chicago, said the soybean complex also may have been boosted by
reports that Germany plans to sell at least some of its excess
soybean crushing capacity to the Soviet Union.
   Such an increase in European crushing activity would likely
translate into increased demand for U.S. soybeans because the
Europeans must import all the beans they use.
   ``We know Brazil is basically out and the Argentinias are
running out, so the only store left in town would be the United
States,'' Freed said.
   At the close, wheat futures were } cent to 2{ cents higher with
the contract for delivery in December at $2.47{ a bushel; corn was
{ cent lower to 2} cents higher with December at $2.30{ a bushel;
oats were \ cent lower to 1} cents higher with December at $1.13} a
bushel; soybeans were 3 cents to 11{ cents higher with January at

   The stock market edged higher today, extending
the previou session's advance in moderate dealings.
   The Dow Jones industrial average, which rose 40.84 points on
Friday, was up 5.45 points at 2,565.10 with one hour left in the
session. It had been up by about 16 points near the opening, but
later gave back nearly all the gains.
   Advancing issues were ahead of decliners by a margin of 3 to 2,
with 929 up, 603 down and 451 unchanged on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   Big Board volume totaled 142.82 million shares as of 3 p.m. on
Wall Street.
   Analysts said the market opened strongly in the wake of gains on
overseas markets and in bond futures trading overnight.
   There was continuing hope that the Bush administration's offer
to discuss the Middle East crisis with Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein might avert a war.
   The rise in the Dow Jones average was held in check by AT&amp;T,
which fell 2&lsqb; to 30 after offering to acquire NCR Corp. in a $6
billion stock swap. AT&amp;T was the most-actively traded issue on the
NYSE.
   NCR was the second most active, surging 26{ to 82\. The AT&amp;T
offer was $90 a share, but NCR indicated it wanted to remain
independent.
   Elsewhere in the technology sector, Digital Equipment was up 3&lsqb;
at 54~, IBM was up &lsqb; at 113}, Hewlett Packard was up 1{ at 31{ and
Honeywell was up 1&lsqb; at 91\.
   There was mixed evidence today on the state of the economy.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management said its
purchasing managers index, a closely-followed economic indicator,
tumbled to 41.3 percent in November from 43.4 percent in October.
   The decline indicated a further weakening in manufacturing and
the overall economy.
   But the government said construction spending increased 1.3
percent in October, the first gain in three months. The advance was
due in large part to new school and sewer projects as spending on
residential and non-residential buildings continued to fall.
   Among active issues on the NYSE, Pepsico was up { at 26&lsqb;, Philip
Morris was up \ at 48~, Limited was up 1\ at 17 and General
Electric was up { to 54|.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed stocks rose 0.95 to
177.01. On the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose

<HEAD>Arco Suits Seek to Force Insurers to Cover Toxic Waste Cleanup
Costs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Atlantic Richfield Co. sued more than 70
insurance carriers for reimbursement of the huge costs of restoring
50 hazardous waste sites polluted over six decades, company
officials said Monday.
   Experts said the case will help set precedents for insurers and
companies nationwide. It stems from a California Supreme Court
ruling two weeks ago that the cost of cleaning up toxic pollution
is part of the damages to be paid by insurers under standard
comprehensive general liability policies.
   Arco, the big Los Angeles-based oil company, also is asking to
have the duties and liabilities of both companies and insurers
clarified under the state Supreme Court ruling.
   ``Arco believes that this action will bring the questions of
insurance coverage and compensation before a single forum for
orderly and efficient resolution and administration,'' Arco said in
a statement.
   Supreme courts in Massachusetts, Minnesota, Washington and North
Carolina have made similar rulings in recent months.
   Thecase decided Nov. 15 said insurance companies that provide
property coverage must pay their policyholders' costs of cleaning
up toxic waste at government order. The case was brought against
AIU Insurance Co. and other insurers after FMC, A Chicago-based
chemical and weapons company, was sued by federal and local
agencies for allegedly polluting land and water at 79 sites in a
number of states.
   The unanimous state Supreme Court ruling was broad but not
all-inclusive. Carriers have legal defenses that include gross
negligence or willful misconduct by the insured. Many recent
policies also exclude all but ``sudden and accidental'' instances
of pollution.
   Companies affected by Superfund legislation all over the nation
are checking old policies to see if they can escape liability for
increasingly expensive toxic cleanup work, said Joel Moskowitz, a
partner specializing in environmental law with the Gibson, Dunn &amp;
Crutcher firm in Los Angeles.
   Steve Wasdick, a spokesman for Aetna Casualty and Surety Co. of
America, said suits over toxic waste liability have frequently
wound up in court, and often turn on the language of the policy. By
the early 1970s, many carriers included ``pollution exclusion''
clauses to avoid liability except when an incident was sudden and
accidental.
   ``There have been a good number that have gone the insurers' way
too,'' Wasdick said.
   Among the carriers named as defendants in Arco's lawsuit are
Aetna, Fireman's Fund Insurance, Travelers Insurance, Lloyd's of
London and more than 20 other foreign companies.
   The defendants issued policies as far back as the 1930s to Arco
and its predecessor companies: Anaconda Co., Richfield Oil Corp.,
Sinclair Oil Corp. and Atlantic Refining Co.
   Arco spokesman Albert Greenstein said it's too early to predict
the effect of the company's suit, filed Nov. 23, because the
Supreme Court ruling opened new ground.
   Greenstein also said it's too early to tell the total costs of
the cleanups. ``It goes back so far and involves so many cases that
it's impossible to say,'' he said.
   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates the average
costs of cleaning up a Superfund site has grown from $9 million to
$25 million during the past five years. However, a recent study by
the Rand Corp. think tank in Santa Monica found that the vast
majority cost far less than that.

   A smell can be registered as a trademark just
as a word, name, symbol, color or sound can be, the Patent and
Trademark Office said in a ground-breaking decision Monday.
   The office approved registration of the scent of a type of
embroidery yarn and sewing thread produced by Clarke's OSEWEZ
(pronounced ``Oh Sew Easy'') of Goleta, Calif.
   According to an exhibit in the case, the yarn can be used to
make, among other things, a scented skunk.
   If nobody objects within 30 days, the registration will be
issued on Feb. 26.
   A trademark is defined by law as any word, name, symbol or
device, or any combination of such things, that is used to
distinguish a product from the products sold or manufactured by
others.
   In an earlier case, the color pink was recognized as a trademark
for a type of fiberglass insulation. The trademark was granted in
the mid-1980s to the Owens-Corning Corp., whose Fiberglas product
is pink.
   Sound marks, such as the NBC chimes, also have been registered.
   There had not previously been a case, however, in which a
trademark was granted for an aroma.
   ``We are all familiar with what trademarks look like,'' said
Jeffrey M. Samuels, assistant commissioner for trademarks. ``Now
we'll see what they smell like.''
   What this one smells like, said Celia Clarke of Clarke's OSEWEZ,
is `` a high impact, fresh, floral fragrance reminiscent of
plumeria blossoms.''
   Trademark Examining Attorney David Cline had refused the
registration on grounds that consumers were likely to regard the
scent as just a pleasant feature of the yarn and not an indication
of its origin.
   Ms. Clarke argued that customers, dealers and distributors
throughout the embroidery field recognized the firm as the source
of scented embroidery yarn and thread.
   She submitted as part of the record a kit containing yarn and
thread for making a scented skunk.
   The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, in a decision handed down
Sept. 19, said Ms. Clarke was the only person who had marketed
yarns and threads with a fragrance.
   ``Under the circumstances of this case, we see no reason why a
fragrance is not capable of serving as a trademark to identify and
distinguish a certain kind of product,'' the board said.
   ``It should be noted that we are not here talking about the
registrability of scents or fragrances of products which are noted
for those features, such as perfumes, colognes or scented household
products,'' it added in a footnote.
   Oscar Mastin, a spokesman for the Patent and Trademark Office,
said perfumes can be patented and their names registered as
trademarks.
   J. David Sams, chairman of the board, said the case was the
first in which copyright registration had been sought for a scent.
   The company advertises its product as ``Clarke's Distinctive
Sof-Scented Yarns.'' They are of the type known in the trade as
Russian embroidery or punch embroidery.
   Ms. Clarke, reached by telephone in Goleta, said the firm, a
manufacturer of punch embroidery needles, has been in business 15
years. She said the application for trademark was submitted about
two years ago, when the company began producing the scented yarn.
   ``We are a small company, so we haven't done a big lot with it,
although we do intend to,'' she said. ``I think we will really push
it now and show it more.''
   More than 1 million trademarks have been registered since the
first trademark law was passed in 1870. About 600,000 of them are
still in use. A trademark registration lasts 10 years and can be
renewed indefinitely.

<TEXT>
   Frank Lorenzo is no longer boss at Continental
Airlines, but the carrier he shaped is following a road he traveled
in the early 1980s when Continental first sought refuge under
federal bankruptcy laws.
   On Monday, Continental Airlines Holdings Inc. filed for
protection for a second time, blaming the move on the recent runup
in fuel costs and heavy debts accrued in the 1980s.
   Lorenzo, the 50-year-old entrepreneur who came to symbolize a
tumultuous decade of airline deregulation, announced in August he
was selling off most of his stake in Continental to Scandinavian
Airlines System.
   He also resigned as chairman and chief executive at Continental,
replaced by Hollis Harris, a respected manager lured from rival
Delta Air Lines Inc.
   Just two weeks ago, in his first public remarks since departing
Continental, Lorenzo warned that the troubles in the airline
industry could leave just three or four major airlines within three
years.
   ``And if you don't like air fares today ... just hold on to your
hats - you may not have seen anything yet in terms of air fare
price increases,'' he said.
   The predecessor to Continental Holdings was Texas Air Corp.,
which Lorenzo built into the nation's largest airline operator,
parenting Continental and Eastern Airlines. The growth of Texas Air
began in 1966 when Lorenzo and Harvard University classmate Robert
Carney formed a financial advisory firm.
   Even before that, in 1963, Lorenzo's first professional job was
in the industry, when he was hired by Trans World Airlines as a
financial analyst. Within two years, he was manager of the
financial analysis department at Eastern.
   In 1968, the Lorenzo-Carney duo created Jet Capital Corp., which
bought a controlling interest in Texas International Airlines in
1972. Lorenzo, then 32, a Harvard MBA and son of Spanish immigrants
from Queens, N.Y., was the carrier's youngest president.
   In 1981, Lorenzo merged Texas International with Continental
after a bitter takeover battle. His image as a union buster began
when he fought organized labor at Continental and won.
   The image grew in 1983 when he put Continental, then the
nation's eighth-largest airline, under bankruptcy protection,
scrapped labor contracts and hired strike replacements at lower
pay.
   Lorenzo subsequently acquired New York Air, People Express and
Frontier airlines, which were merged into Continental.
   He didn't face another labor fight until he acquired Eastern in
1986, where his relationship with unions was acrimonious and a
strike against the airline made him the target of union members'
hatred.
   Using billions of dollars in borrowed money and cheap fares,
Continental and Eastern, once high-cost airlines, helped Texas Air
become the nation's largest airline operator, capturing about 20
percent of the domestic market.
   But with bitter resistance from the unions, particularly at
Eastern, both airlines came under extreme financial pressure and
there were doubts about Eastern's ability to survive.
   After the strike hamstrung Eastern in 1989, Eastern sought
bankruptcy court protection and is still operating under the
supervision of a court trustee who replaced Lorenzo in April.
   It was then that Continental began a quiet hunt for a new
leader, a search that resulted in the hiring of Harris.
   ``It's been perfectly obvious to me that I personally have
become a lightning rod for many of the attacks that the company has
taken,'' Lorenzo said in announcing his departure.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Stop Sliding; Up 30 Cents a Barrel</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Oil prices see-sawed but finished slightly
higher Monday as traders saw dimmed peace hopes in the Persian
Gulf.
   Light sweet crude oil settled at $29.15 per barrel, up 30 cents,
on the New York Mercantile Exchange on contracts for January
delivery. Price tumbled $4.06 a barrel Friday, when President Bush
proposed face-to-face discussions with ranking Iraqi officials.
   ``It was coming back from a bit of an overreaction on Friday,''
said Ed Kevelson, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Speculation of a possible diplomatic solution to the Persian
Gulf crisis pushed crude futures to their second sharpest drop
since Iraq invaded Kuwait in August.
   Crude fell Monday on hints of peace and rose on hints of war,
but stayed slightly higher all day. It rose as much as $1.63 per
barrel, but near the end of trading, crude was only 20 cents
higher.
   ``We had selling, as it appeared the peace winds were blowing,''
said analyst Bob Baker at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Prices fell after the State Department said only U.S. and Iraqi
officials would participate in the proposed talks later this month,
which traders interpreted as a sign of progress toward peace.
   But crude began rising again after Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
said sanctions against Iraq might not be sufficient to get Iraqi
troops out of Kuwait.
   War in the Middle East would threaten crucial world oil
supplies, making crude more expensive.
   Crude for delivery in later months fell as those contracts moved
to catch up with the losses suffered by January crude. On Friday,
later months had been held back by daily decline limits intended to
lessen risks faced by oil traders.
   Futures for refined petroleum products kept falling on Monday in
a move to catch up with Friday's crude losses.
   Unleaded gasoline settled at 73.52 cents per gallon, down 5.40
cents, on contracts for January delivery. Home heating oil settled
at 84.67 cents a gallon, down 3.75 cents, on contracts for January
delivery. Later contract months were down for both products.
   Some analysts were surprised that unleaded gasoline showed more
weakeness than home heating oil. Baker suggested traders might have
been responding belatedly to higher federal gasoline taxes imposed
over the weekend.
   Natural gas prices, which are not affected by the Mideast
standoff since it does not threaten supplies, were higher Monday.
Contracts for January delivery rose 3 cents to $2.475 per 1,000
cubic feet. Later contracts rose moderately.

   Business continued to slow at the nation's
industrial firms in November, extending a decline that is likely to
continue for some time, the National Association of Purchasing
Management said Monday.
   Private economists, agreeing with the trade group's assessment,
predicted the downturn will continue until interest rates come down
and the Middle East crisis is resolved.
   The purchasing managers said production and new orders both
dropped, pushing the group's index of economic activity down to
41.3 percent from 43.4 percent in October.
   The latest monthly decline was the fifth in a row, sending the
index to its lowest point since November 1982, during the last
recession.
   When the index registers below 50 percent, it indicates the
manufacturing economy is declining, and when it drops below 44
percent, it points to a shrinking of the overall economy.
   The survey results substantiated other statistical evidence that
the economy's health has worsened, including a Commerce Department
report Monday on construction spending.
   The department said spending for new building rose 1.3 percent
in October, the first gain in three months. But the advance was
largely due to new school and sewer projects. Spending on
residential and non-residential buildings continued to fall.
   Overall residential, non-residential and government spending
totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $434.4 billion, up
from $428.9 billion in September.
   Alan Levinson, an economist with Wefa Group, a private economic
forecasting service based in Bala Cynwd, Pa., said the purchasing
managers results ``confirm the fact that we are slipping deeper
into recession.''
   Robert Chandross, chief economist with Lloyds Bank PLC in New
York, called the survey figures ``unambiguously weak'' with
employment particularly hard-hit.
   Thirty-three percent of the purchasing managers questioned said
employment was down at their companies, while 62 percent said it
was the same and 5 percent said hiring was up.
   In October, 28 percent said employment was down, 63 percent said
it was the same and 9 percent said it was higher.
   The purchasing managers said many companies reported layoffs,
hiring freezes, plant closings and other steps to bring staffing
levels in line with business activity.
   Employment s tied directly to production and new orders, both
of which declined.
   Forty-three percent of the purchasing managers surveyed said
their firms had fewer new orders in November, while 39 percent said
orders were the same and only 18 percent said they had more orders.
   It was the fifth consecutive monthly decline for new orders,
dropping them to to their lowest point since May 1982. In October,
34 percent reported fewer orders, 47 percent were the same and 19
percent were up.
   Robert Bretz, chairman of the trade group, said the decline in
orders was an ominous sign for the economy.
   ``It appears likely the negative trend will continue for some
time,'' Bretz said in a statement.
   Production levels fell for the fourth straight month in
November. Thirty-five percent of those surveyed said production at
their firms was down, 49 percent said it was the same and 16
percent said it was up.
   In October, 31 percent reported lower production, 52 percent
said it was the same and 17 percent said it was up.
   The survey also found that deliveries to the companies from
suppliers were faster than the previous month. This is yet another
negative economic signal, because it means companies have fewer
orders to fill and therefore can deliver their goods faster.
   Inflation, accelerated by the surge in oil prices since the
Middle East crisis began in August, continued to put a bite on
industrial firms. Most reported they were again paying higher
prices for raw materials, although the rate of increase was down
from September and October.
   Chandross said the economy would begin to turn around if the
Federal Reserve eases credit.
   ``The weaker the economy looks, the more aggressively the
Federal Reserve will have to lower interest rates,'' to stimulate
business activity, he said.
   Both he and Levinson said, however, that the Middle East crisis,
which has sent oil prices sharply higher, stands in the way of an
economic recovery.
   ``Hopefully, in the early part of next year, some kind of
resolution to the Persian Gulf crisis will allow business and
individuals to go forward with a little more certainty,'' Levinson
said.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management is a trade
group of purchasing executives at industrial companies across the
country. Its monthly survey questions purchasing managers at 300
firms.

   Stock prices posted modest gains Monday, as oil
prices appeared to stabilize at lower levels and interest rates
slipped.
   But more evidence of a weakening economy and a decline in
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph stock in the wake of its $6 billion
stock offer for NCR Corp. limited the gains.
   The Dow Jones industrial average, which rose 40.84 points on
Friday, added another 5.94 points to close at 2,565.59. It had been
up by about 16 points near the opening, but quickly gave up most of
those gains.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 3 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
964 up, 612 down and 444 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 177.01 million
shares, compared with 192.35 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 211.46 million shares.
   Analysts said the market opened strongly in the wake of gains on
overseas markets and a strong performance in the bond futures
market overnight.
   There was continuing hope that the Bush administration's offer
to discuss the Middle East crisis with Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein might avert a war.
   That development had sparked a big drop in oil prices on Friday
and prices recovered only a fraction of that ground on Monday.
   The January contract for light, sweet crude oil, which lost
$4.06 a barrel on Friday, edged up 30 cents Monday to settle at
$29.15 a barrel.
   Bond prices, meanwhile, advanced and pushed yields on 30-year
bonds down toward 8.35 percent from 8.39 percent at the end of last
week.
   Tempering the stock market's advance were signs of more economic
weakness.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management said its
purchasing managers index, a closely-followed economic indicator,
tumbled to 41.3 percent in November from 43.4 percent in October in
another sign of weakening in manufacturing and the overall economy.
   ``People are realizing the main factor in the stock market is
the economy and these figures are still painting a dismal picture
of the economy,'' said Newton Zinder, a veteran market watcher at
Shearson Lehman Bros.
   The government reported construction spending increased 1.3
percent in October, but much of that was due to new school and
sewer projects. Spending on residential and non-residential
buildings continued to fall.
   The rise in the Dow Jones average was constrained by AT&amp;T, which
fell 2 to 30&lsqb; after offering to acquire NCR in a $6 billion stock
swap. AT&amp;T was the most-actively traded issue on the NYSE with
nearly 8.5 million shares traded.
   NCR was the second most active, surging 24} to 81{. The AT&amp;T
offer was $90 a share, but NCR indicated it wanted to remain
independent.
   Elsewhere in the technology sector, Digital Equipment rose 2} to
54{, Hewlett Packard gained } to 30} and Honeywell rose } to 90~.
IBM lost \ to 113&rsqb;, however.
   Continental Airlines Holdings dropped 2 to 1&rsqb; after it filed for
protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws.
   But some of the big airline companies rose, reflecting
expectations of lower fuel prices and speculation they could
benefit from the problems affecting airlines like Continental. UAL
climbed 1~ to 99&rsqb;, Delta Airlines rose 1} to 58{ and AMR Corp., the
parent of American Airlines, gained 1\ to 48{.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose $17.83 billion, or 0.59
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.01 to 177.07.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 2.13 to 380.05, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index gained 1.88 to 324.10.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
2.26 to 361.32. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 302.60, up 0.81.

<HEAD>Court Shields Businesses from Some Suits in Pension Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Businesses facing lawsuits over pensions
received some protection from the Supreme Court Monday as the
justices ruled workers cannot sue in state courts on grounds they
were fired so their employers would not have to pay pension
benefits.
   The court ruled unanimously that state suits are pre-empted by
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, which is aimed
at assuring that workers get their retirement pay.
   State lawsuits had loomed as potentially far more lucrative
because fired employees could win punitive damages that greatly
exceed lost pay.
   In other cases affecting businesses, the Supreme Court on
Monday:
   -Left intact an Iowa Supreme Court ruling that forced four
Omaha, Neb., automobile dealerships to defend themselves in Iowa
courts in lawsuits brought under that state's consumer fraud laws.
The dealerships had argued that Iowa's courts have no authority
over them.
   -Ruled that a federal anti-counterfeiting law may be used to
crack down on the sale of used cars with phony mileage readings.
   Writing in the pension case, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said
Congress clearly intended to preclude state lawsuits over firings
motivated by efforts to avoid paying pension benefits.
   ``The goal was to minimize the administrative and financial
burden of complying with conflicting directives among states or
between states and the federal government,'' O'Connor said.
   The decision is a victory for the Ingersoll-Rand Co., which was
sued by Perry McClendon after it fired him in 1982.
   McClendon had been transferred by the company from San Antonio
to Dallas in 1979 to develop a sales market for construction
equipment there. He was fired four months before his 10th
anniversary with the company.
   A worker with 10 years experience is entitled to have his
pension vested, which meant Ingersoll-Rand would have to contribute
to McClendon's retirement benefits.
   McClendon sued in Texas state courts, accusing his former
employer of firing him to avoid paying pension benefits. The
company said he was fired to reduce the workforce and save money.
   McClendon did not sue for lost pension benefits. In fact,
shortly after he sued the company agreed to vest his pension.
Instead, McClendon's suit sought a potentially big-money judgment
for lost wages, mental anguish and punitive damages.

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Monday it hopes to
halve state ownership of businesses in the next few years as it
replaces the Marxist economic model of past Communist rulers with
one where private ownership dominates.
   ``We may succeed in reducing the share of state ownership to 50
percent or less in the coming three to four years,'' government
official Lajos Csepi told reporters.
   Csepi is managing director of the State Property Agency, set up
in March as Hungary prepared for the first democratic elections in
four decades, to oversee the sale of state-owned assets.
   He spoke on the eve of a scheduled national address by Premier
Jozsef Antall expected to deal primarily with the dismal state of
the economy. The 1991 budget, to be presented in Parliament next
week, envisages a deficit of 78 billion forints, or $1.3 billion.
   As in other East European countries liberated from Communist
domination this year, initial euphoria among the population has
been replaced by gloom over the economic picture as the nation
struggles to correct past mistakes.
   Inflation is at 35 percent. The foreign debt has reached $20
billion, the highest per capita among former Soviet bloc nations.
Unemployment, officially unknown under the Communist leadership, is
now at 70,000 and is expected to balloon to 200,000 of the 4.5
million work force by next year. Poverty is growing.
   The state MTI news agency cited statistics indicating that at
least 60 percent of families are drawing on savings just to make
ends meet, compared to 40 percent last year.
   Growing frustration peaked late last month in a three-day
national blockade of main streets and highways by truckers and
cabbies irate over a planned 65-percent gasoline price hike.
   Most of the population supported the unprecedented protest,
forcing Antall's conservative government coalition to back down and
agree to lesser price increases.
   The decision to increase gasoline prices was due in part to
shortfalls in promised Soviet oil deliveries and to the rising
price of crude on the world market because of the Gulf crisis.
   Janos Martonyi, state secretary of the Ministry of International
Economic Relations, recently estimated economic damage from the
Gulf crisis at $200 million, including the cancellation of trade
with Iraq under terms of a U.N. embargo.
   Worsening economic conditions have taken their toll on
government popularity, with Hungarians increasingly agreeing with
opposition charges that the return to a capitalist economy is being
mismanaged and is taking too long.
   The criticism has exacerbated internal government differences.
Finance Minister Ferenc Rabar announced Oct. 10 that he planned to
resign after passage of the budget, following months of dispute
with Gyoergy Matolcsi, state secretary of the Prime Minister's
Office and a key economic aide, over responsibility for long-term
economic plans.

<HEAD>Soybeans Bound to 5-Week High on Bullish Supply-Demand Outlook</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices bounded to five-week highs Monday on the
Chicago Board of Trade in a late rally fueled by signs of tight
supplies and prospects for stronger export demand. Most grain
futures also advanced.
   On other commodity markets, most energy futures fell sharply;
gold futures retreated while silver advanced; cattle futures were
mixed; and pork futures were lower.
   Soybean futures settled 4\ cents to 11} cents higher in Chicago
with the contract for delivery in January at $6.01\ a bushel, the
first daily close above $6 for a near-term contract since Oct. 25.
   Wheat finished 1{ cents to 2{ cents higher with December at
$2.47{ a bushel; corn was \ cent lower to 2{ cents higher with
December at $2.30\ a bushel; oats were \ cent lower to 1} cents
higher with December at $1.13} a bushel.
   The surge began in the soybean oil pit after a large number of
oil delivery notices were cancelled, indicating soybean oil
supplies for delivery against the December contract may be tighter
than previously thought, according to analysts.
   Steve Freed, grains analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in
Chicago, said the soybean complex also was boosted by reports that
Germany is considering selling at least some of its excess soybean
crushing capacity to the Soviet Union.
   He said such an increase in European crushing activity probably
would result in stronger demand for U.S. soybeans since the
Europeans must import all the beans they use.
   ``We know Brazil is basically out and the Argentinians are
running out so the only store left in town would be the United
States,'' Freed said.
   William Biedermann, research director for the commodities
brokerage Allendale Inc., said U.S. farmers have been reluctant to
sell their soybeans at the recent low prices, which bottomed out at
$5.52 a bushel on Nov. 14. The limited availability of new-crop
beans has contributed to the rise in prices, he said.
   Biedermann said tax considerations will prevent many farmers
from selling new-crop commodities until the new year, leading to
further supply tightness.
   ``You can figure that from now until the end of the year the bin
door is locked up,'' he said.
   Near-term crude oil rose slightly but other petroleum futures
fell sharply on the New York Mercantile Exchange, reflecting lower
fears of war in the Persian Gulf. The decline extended the steep
losses that were posted Friday in reaction to President Bush's new
push for a negotiated settlement in the U.S.-Iraqi standoff over
Iraq's occupation of Kuwait.
   ``The story supporting a negotiated solution is still fresh in
everybody's mind,'' said Ray Mazzeo, energy futures specialist with
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
   Light sweet crude oil futures settled $1.97 lower to 30 cents
higher with January at $29.15 a barrel; heating oil was 2.29 cents
to 3.89 cents lower with January at 84.67 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was 3.1 cents to 5.4 cents lower with January at 73.52
cents a gallon; natural gas was 0.1 cent to 3.5 cents higher with
January at $2.475 per 1,000 cubic feet.
   Gold futures fell sharply on New York's Commodity Exchange in
line with the drop in energy prices and a stronger dollar. Silver
edged higher.
   Gold settled $6.70 to $7.70 lower with December at $376.60 a
troy ounce; silver was 1 cent to 1.6 cents higher with December at
$4.138 a troy ounce.
   Cattle futures finished narrowly mixed on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Pork futures retreated amid profit-taking after rallying
early in the session on perceptions that hog marketings in the
Midwest would be slowed by wintry weather.
   Live cattle finished .20 cent lower to .30 cent higher with
December at 78.70 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent lower
to .10 cent higher with January at 87.60 a pound; live hogs were
unchanged to .33 cent lower with December at 50.62 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .75 cents to 1.1 cents lower with February
at 65.90 cents a pound.

   The dollar closed sharply higher Monday, spurred
by reports that the big industrial nations will step in to halt the
U.S. currency's recent slide.
   Gold prices skidded, tumbling more than $6 a troy ounce in New
York, in response to the dollar's advance.
   Analysts said the dollar was boosted by reports that the Group
of Seven industrial nations would meet in January to discuss
stabilizing the U.S. currency.
   The G-7 nations, the United States, Britain, France, Germany,
Japan, Italy and Canada, have said little as the dollar plunged in
recent months. Their reticence contributed to the U.S. currency's
slide as traders believed the countries wanted a lower dollar, so
speculation that the G-7 was about to take a stand sent the dollar
higher Monday.
   Kevin Lawrie, senior foreign exchange manager with the Bank of
Boston, said the Persian Gulf crisis continued to affect dollar
trading, with rumors alternately sparking buying and selling. The
dollar is seen as a relatively safe investment in times of
international strife.
   ``We're all looking over our shoulder,'' he said. ``It's very
volatile and confusing.''
   Oveaseas traders said the dollar was also supported by the
Treasury's twice-yearly report to Congress on international
economic and exchange rate policy. The report stressed the
government's desire to see the U.S. trade deficit improved by
fundamental economic factors rather than by a weak dollar.
   Lawrie said the dollar also rose on technical buying by
investors adding to their portfolios before the end of the year.
   The dollar surged against the British pound. Sterling fell to
$1.9180 in New York from late Friday's $1.9430. In London earlier,
the British pound fell to $1.9205 from $1.9400 late Friday.
   The U.S. currency also jumped against the Japanese yen. In New
York, the dollar closed at 134.735 yen, up from 132.50 late Friday.
   In Tokyo overnight, the dollar rose 0.25 yen to a closing 133.00
yen, and it was quoted later in London at 134.35 yen.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
prices, included: 1.51395 German marks, up from 1.5020; 1.2935
Swiss francs, up from 1.2770; 5.1135 French francs, up from 5.0580;
1,138.00 Italian lire, up from 1,125.25; and 1.16625 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.16475.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe compared with late Friday,
included: 1.5125 German marks, up from 1.4990; 1.2915 Swiss francs,
up from 1.2760; 5.1113 French francs, up from 5.0630; 1.7055 Dutch
guilders, up from 1.6910; 1,137.00 Italian lire, up from 1,122.00;
1.1655 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1640.
   Gold prices fell as the dollar advanced and amid some optimism
that the Middle East crisis might be resolved without military
action.
   In New York, a troy ounce of gold closed at $376.60 on the
Commodity Exchange, down $6.70. Republic National Bank later quoted
a bid of $375.50, down $6.50.
   Gold fell earlier in London to a late bid price of $380.50 a
troy ounce from $382.25 late Friday. In Zurich, the metal fell to a
closing bid of $380.85, down from $385.00 late Friday.
   In Hong Kong, gold fell $4.95 to close at a bid $380.06.
   Silver prices advanced. In New York, silver rose 1.6 cents to
close at $4.138 on the Commodity Exchange. In London earlier,
silver rose to a late bid price of $4.16 a troy ounce from Friday's
$4.11.

   For three years, the tobacco industry and its Congressional
allies have lobbied the Environmental Protection Agency to soften
or delay its three draft reports on second-hand cigarette smoke,
documents show.
   Industry representatives sent the EPA a mountain of technical
information that dwarfs the EPA's reports and met repeatedly with
agency officials to press their concerns, according to documents
obtained by The Associated Press under the Freedom of Information
Act.
   ``They clearly were privy to stuff that was going on that we had
no idea about,'' said Mark Pertschuk, executive director of
Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights in Berkeley, Calif.
   The EPA at the industry's request twice extended the time
allowed for outside comment on draft reports.
   ``No one else was as active in conveying their concerns and
interests,'' said Robert Axelrad, director of the EPA's indoor air
division. He said the agency received ``boxloads'' of material from
the industry.
   The next step in the preparation of the reports occurs Tuesday
and Wednesday in Washington. An advisory panel chosen by the agency
will meet to consider the reports and hear testimony from
interested parties, including a dozen tobacco industry
representatives.
   Two of the three reports will be considered: a report assessing
the lung cancer risks associated with passive smoking, and a
workplace policy guide on environmental tobacco smoke.
   The risk assessment recommends that environmental tobacco smoke
be declared a class A carcinogen - a known cause of human cancer.
   A third EPA report, a compendium of related technical
information on passive smoking, is undergoing revision.
   Two Republicans from the tobacco state of Virginia - U.S. Rep.
Thomas Bliley and Sen. John Warner - have written to the EPA
expressing concerns shared by the industry. Bliley has repeatedly
sought clarification of EPA procedures and protested the agency's
reliance on certain scientists whose work has found large risks
associated with passive smoking.
   Brennan Dawson, a spokeswoman for the Tobacco Institute, said
passive smoking is important to the industry and ``we've let the
EPA know.''
   ``What we have tried to do is stay in the process and do it
appropriately and through conversations with EPA staff,'' she said.
   ``There has been a lot of involvement by the anti-smoking
community that we don't think should be there. If you're going to
pursue science, it ought to be without advocacy. ...
   ``The outcome certainly has not been entirely to our
satisfaction.''
   Most of the EPA's correspondence with industry representatives
makes clear the industry's comments are welcome. In a June 30,
1989, letter, however, an assistant administrator of the EPA
criticized the industry for its continued refusal to admit that
smoking causes cancer and other diseases in smokers.
   The industry's argument that passive smoking is not a proven
danger ``would be more credible if it were not so similar to the
tobacco industry's position on direct smoking, despite the
estimated 50,000 studies linking smoking with disease in humans,''
wrote William Rosenberg, the EPA's assistant administrator for air
and radiation.
   The industry has been lobbying outside the EPA, too. The Tobacco
Institute and the two largest tobacco companies, Philip Morris and
R.J. Reynolds, have formed a ``media subcommittee'' to get their
message to the media.
   Three R.J. Reynolds scientists, a company spokeswoman and an
adviser from PR firm Hill and Knowlton have been on the road nearly
full-time since Labor Day talking to reporters and newspaper
editorial boards about the EPA reports, said Betsy Annese of R.J.
Reynolds.
   Anti-smoking groups were critical of the apparent access granted
the tobacco companies by the EPA.
   ``They basically have no business being in there at all,'' said
Richard Daynard, an attorney and the chairman of the Tobacco
Products Liability Group in Boston. ``Nobody's talking in these
proceedings about regulating the tobacco industry. They're talking
about regulating individual behavior.''
   ``As I look at the intense pressure that the tobacco industry
placed on EPA staff, I see that they had a tremendous amount of
information about the process,'' said Pertschuk.

<HEAD>Investors Partnership Calls for Avon Stock Buyback</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of powerful investors increased its
pressure on Avon Products Inc. management Monday, calling for the
cosmetics company to repurchase $500 million of its own shares.
   In a letter to Avon Chairman James E. Preston, Chartwell
Associates said the move would ``enhance value for all
shareholders.''
   Chartwell conceded in the letter that such a move ``will require
debt restructuring.'' The letter was disclosed in a filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
   In New York, where Avon is based, Avon spokesman John Cox said
there was nothing new in the recommendation.
   ``Chartwell's letter, in effect, endorses several of the many
proposals that have been placed on the table during the last few
months,'' he said.
   ``A special committee of the board of directors is studying all
of these proposals with its independent adviser, James D.
Wolfensohn &amp; Co., which will present its recommendations to the
board in January,'' Cox said, adding, ``Further comment of the
merits of the specific proposals would be premature.''
   Chartwell, a limited partnership that includes oil heir Gordon
P. Getty's Family Trust, controls about 19.9 percent of Avon's
stock.
   The partnership has been wrangling with Avon since last year
when Chartwell started buying large blocks of Avon stock and sought
seats on the board of directors.
   The letter to Peterson listed other recommendations proposed by
Chartwell's investment bankers, Lehman Brothers.
   Those recommendations included trying to sell the Giorgio
subsidiary, and reappraising the decision to sell a portion of Avon
Japan.

<HEAD>Hearings Begin on Trump Taj Mahal Financial Stability</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY STERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Donald Trump's Taj Mahal Casino
Resort got off to a shaky start but a proposed restructuring of
$675 million in debt will give it time to recover, casino officials
testified Monday.
   ``The anticipation and expectation was perhaps way too high,
knowing what we know today,'' said Ed Tracy, president of Trump's
Atlantic City holdings.
   He and Trump Organization chief financial officer Stephen
Bollenbach blamed the casino's problems on the recession in the
Northeast and on its failure to capture enough of the lucrative
slot machine market.
   But both said conservative projections for the coming year leave
the property poised to recover.
   ``When times get good again, we'll have a wonderful property,''
Bollenbach told the state Casino Control Commission during a
special hearing into the Taj Mahal's financial stability.
   Trump did not attend the hearing, but his associates said they
expected to finish details of the restructuring within a week and
file it with the Securities and Exchange Commission Dec. 17.
   The casino commission said it would hold hearings Dec. 12aand
Dec. 19 as details of the restructuring plan are finalized.
   A ruling would come after Dec. 19, said chairman Steve Perskie.
   Under state law, the commission is responsible for ensuring that
each casino licensee remains financially stable and has the power
to revoke a license.
   One day after missing a $47.3 million bond payment due investors
in the Taj Mahal, Trump reached a restructuring deal on Nov. 16
that reduces the interest rate on the notes from 14 percent to 12
percent.
   The agreement also spreads the repayment date over 10 years to
the year 2000 instead of 1998, and gives bondholders half ownership
in the Taj Mahal.
   Trump can recover up to 30 percent of the ownership if he can
repay the bonds at rates above 12 percent.
   The casino plans to enter into a ``prepackaged'' bankruptcy
agreed to by bondholders and emerge by the spring, Bollenbach said.
   State gaming regulators, however, said the plan fails to cut the
Taj Mahal's debt significantly. They said it was still too early to
assess the deal's prospects.
   ``Regrettably, future stability cannot be adequately judged now
but must await an assessment of the final resolution between the
Taj Mahal and its bondholders,'' said Deputy Attorney General
Thomas Auriemma.
   ``Nevertheless, to the extent that the crisis which has
developed has forced this company to rethink its entire capital
structure, there may be long-term positive benefits for this
licensee,'' he said.
   Trump executives continued to play up the agreement.
   ``The really important element is ... that it reduces the
interest rate,'' Bollenbach said. ``A 12 percent rate would be a
very competitive rate.''
   Another key aspect of the deal would allow the casino to borrow
up to $50 million to meet debt service, with bondholders agreeing
to relinquish their claim to the new lender, he said. That means
the new lender would have first claim if any action is taken
against the Taj Mahal.
   Tracy and Bollenbach noted the Taj Mahal has cut operating
costs, with a 29 percent cut in payroll.

Contributions</HEAD>

   Former Vernon Savings Association owner Don R.
Dixon, on trial for bank fraud, testified Monday that he told
executives of the thrift to check with attorneys before reimbursing
themselves for political contributions.
   Dixon spent all day in the witness chair, his second day of
testimony. Prosecutors and defense attorney Billy Ravkind said
Dixon would finish testifying Tuesday and the jury is expected to
get the case on Wednesday.
   Some of the 38 bank fraud and conspiracy charges against Dixon
accuse him of making illegal political donations with Vernon funds.
Former Vernon officers have testified that Dixon encouraged them to
donate money to certain candidates and reimburse themselves through
falsified company expense accounts.
   Dixon, responding to Ravkind, said he encouraged political
donations to ``try to maintain the environment we were prospering
in.'' But he said some officers complained the donations were a
hardship.
   ``If it's that hard on you, you can expense it on our expense
account if you can clear it with our attorneys,'' Dixon said he
told one Vernon official. He said he didn't authorize any Vernon
officer to cheat on expense accounts.
   He is also accused of using Vernon funds personally for
prostitutes, trips and beach houses in California.
   If convicted on all counts, Dixon could be sentenced to up to
190 years in prison and be fined as much as $9.5 million.
   During cross-examination, prosecutors focused on an agreement
between Dixon and developer Jim Atkinson, who paid for a beach
house near San Diego that Vernon and Dixon used.
   Dixon testified he and Atkinson, a Vernon borrower, had agreed
``on a handshake'' that Atkinson could use the house half the time
and receive a share of the proceeds of its sale in return for
paying its lease.
   He said there were no written documents of the agreement for
thrift regulators to inspect.
   Under Ravkind's questioning, Dixon said Vernon needed the $1
million house to boost its image while moving into the southern
California real estate market.
   ``For a little savings and loan from Vernon, Texas, to go to the
shores of southern California and attract any type of quality
builder-investors, we felt we had to be part of the community,''
Dixon said.
   He said the house was remodeled to include three master bedrooms
and three smaller bedrooms so that it could be used by the thrift's
executives while visiting their California operations.
   He said the thrift had planned to sell the beach house after
establishing a permanent office in the San Diego area, which he
originally thought would take three years.
   Vernon was still making payments on the house in 1986, previous
witnesses have said. The thrift opened an office in San Diego in
1983, but it did not have facilities for executives, such as a
conference room, Dixon said.
   Dixon also provided details of trips to Kansas and California he
took with Linton Bowman, former commissioner of the Texas Savings
and Loan Department. The trips were paid for by Vernon. He
testified their expense was not harmful to the savings and loan.
   The California trips were made, Dixon said, so Bowman would
``get comfortable with the rapid growth of Vernon in southern
California.'' Dixon also wanted Bowman to check out some car
dealership investments he was considering and a computer system
developed by a southern California thrift consultant.
   Dixon said he helped arrange for a female Vernon employee to be
a date for Bowman on one those trips. Providing a date was
``probably inappropriate, but at the time I did not think so,''
Dixon testified.
   He said it was not a ``regular business practice'' for Vernon to
provide escorts at social functions and said the thrift never paid
women for sex.
   Dixon said he had no recollection of ``anything off-color'' ever
occurring during parties the thrift hosted, as other witnesses have
testified.
   Dixon testified he became concerned about Vernon's financial
condition in the mid-1980s when he heard rumors Congress might
change tax laws and thrift regulators might step up their efforts.
   Dixon said regulators, lawmakers and thrift leaders, including
himself, should all be faulted for the savings and loan crisis.
``We should all share in the blame,'' he said.
   Vernon failed in 1987 at an estimated cost to taxpayers of more
than $1.2 billion. Dixon, who developed condominiums before
purchasing Vernon in 1981, increased the thrift's assets tenfold
through speculative real estate and construction deals.

<HEAD>Texas Oilman, Unions to Investigate Foreign Investment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN NOLAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens and building
trade unions from Ohio and Kentucky said Monday they are starting a
research organization to investigate foreign investment in a
six-state region.
   Jerry Hammond, executive secretary-treasurer of the Kentucky
State Building &amp; Construction Trades Council, said the study will
focus first on Japanese investment in the region's auto industry
because of the investments by Toyota, Nissan, Mazda, Mitsubishi,
Honda and Subaru-Isuzu.
   He said the study is likely to expand to Japanese investment in
the steel business, Australian regional investments and Italian
contractors.
   Pickens has become a leading critic of Japan's business
practices because of his frustrated attempts to get a board seat on
a Japanese company he's invested in.
   He said the Japanese, who are among the biggest foreign
investors in this country, are unfairly preventing American entry
into Japanese corporate management.
   He attended a luncheon to give a $5,000 check for the
Mid-America Project.
   The building trade councils of Cincinnati and central Kentucky
are joining in the project. Jerry Monahan, executive secretary of
the Cincinnati council, estimated the unions would provide about
$25,000 in financing.
   Pickens said he is confident the study will find evidence that
Japanese keiretsus - cartel-like organizations of interlocking
companies - are operating in the United States to the detriment of
outside competitors.
   Pickens noted that the Federal Trade Commission, at the urging
of Congress, is investigating to determine whether Japan is
exporting its corporate cartels in violation of U.S. antitrust
laws.
   ``There's no doubt in my mind that the Mid-America Project is
going to find that the keiretsu system is being exported to the
U.S. and is more damaging than anyone ever figured,'' Pickens said.
   Union leaders said they want to compile a computerized
information database of foreign investment in Illinois, Indiana,
Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee. They expect the first data
by late spring and will use it to assess job prospects and
employment practices, and to better understand the objectives of
foreign investors,
   Hammond said the unions intend to be fair to the Japanese in the
study. They will gather information from published studies and
public information, including corporate filings and courthouse
records.
   ``We see new neighbors we don't know. We hear languages we don't
understand,'' Hammond told the union members. ``We don't fear
change. ... Change and ignorance is a dangerous combination.''
   Union leaders said they contacted Pickens to initiate the
research project because they support Pickens' drive for American
access to Japanese markets equal to what Japanese companies are
granted in the United States.
   Pickens, founder of Dallas-based Mesa Petroleum, says the
management of Japan's Koito Manufacturing Co., supplier of lighting
systems for Toyota vehicles, has denied him seats on the company's
board and access to its financial documents even though Pickens'
Boone Co. investment firm owns 26 percent of Koito.
   ``All I want is a chance. American shareholders must have the
same investment rights in Japan that Japanese investors have in the
United States,'' Pickens said.
   He said 850 of 900 U.S. companies with Japanese investors have
Japanese board members.
   Nori Shikata, press attache at the Japanese embassy in
Washington, responded: ``We are not sure how applicable his own
specific case is to when he describes the total Japanese
environment.''
   Shikata said the Cincinnati-based Procter &amp; Gamble Co. is among
U.S. companies that have penetrated the Japanese market.
   ``The people who are not successful tend to complain,'' Shikata
said.
   Koito Manufacturing Co. said through a press statement that
Pickens has been harassing Koito in a ``greenmail raid.''
   ``Pickens has cynically poisoned Japanese-American trade
relations in an effort to advance his own personal financial
interests,'' Koito said.

<HEAD>Strikes Idle Ports in Philadelphia, Baltimore</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE RULE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 2,000 dockworkers in and around Philadelphia and in
Baltimore stayed off the job Monday as strikes prevented ships from
loading or unloading during the ports' busiest season.
   ``We're not going to handle anything without a contract,'' said
Dan Duffy, a longshoreman in Philadelphia, where a strike entered
its third day.
   The walkout involves eight locals of the International
Longshoremen's Association representing about 2,000 dockworkers at
Delaware River ports in Philadelphia, southern New Jersey and
Wilmington, Del.
   The workers went on strike Saturday after rejecting an offer for
a new contract by the Philadelphia Marine Trade Association, an
employers' group.
   In Baltimore, business at the waterfront was at a
near-standstill after 415 cargo clerks began a walkout Monday after
contract talks collapsed over pension and benefit fund
contributions.
   Without cargo clerks to process documents, most ships were not
being loaded or unloaded in Baltimore.
   The strikes coincide with the ports' busiest season, when
imported fruit keeps the docks bustling.
   The Philadelphia-area ports are to receive 22 ships by
Wednesday, said Susan Howland, a spokeswoman for the Philadelphia
Maritime Exchange. She said five ships already have been diverted
to posts in Massachusetts, Connecticut and Virginia.
   Negotiators for the workers and the Philadelphia-area ports met
Monday and were to resume talks Tuesday. The union struck after the
dockworkers' 14-month contract extension expired at midnight
Friday.
   The union and the employers could not agree on the terms of a
new three-year, 10-month contract. Union and port officials said
the stumbling blocks included work rules and employer contributions
to welfare and benefit funds.
   The strike by Local 953 of the ILA in Baltimore was surprising
because a tentative agreement was reached Friday with locals
representing most of the Port of Baltimore's 2,000 union members.
   It was not clear whether other locals would honor the cargo
clerks' walkout.
   Baltimore officials had hoped to get some cargo diverted from
Philadelphia because of the strike there. Richard Trainor, chairman
of the Maryland Port Commission, said the port generates $7.6
million in business a day and can expect to lose $2.5 million each
day of the strike.

   BASF Corp. said Monday it would spend $400,000
to retrain workers left unemployed by an explosion that damaged one
of the company's chemical plants, but a union criticized the offer
as a publicity stunt.
   ``We're all about 50. We have high blood pressure and other
ailments. Who's going to hire us?'' said John Littlejohn, vice
president of Chemical Workers Local 417. ``We're too old for
school.''
   Littlejohn said the local's members want the $400,000 divided
among the 96 workers who lost their jobs after the July 19
explosion. BASF said it would pay for tuition at vocational
schools, books and living expenses.
   The blast, blamed on explosive fumes from a cleaning solvent,
destroyed much of the plant, which made chemicals to coat paper
cups and food cans. The explosion killed two people and injured
about 80 others.
   The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined
the company $1.6 million in November, citing more than 100 safety
violations at the plant.
   ``While our actions can in no way make up for the hardships
caused by the accident, we have tried to do as much as we can, and
we will continue to do so,'' said J. Larry Jameson, president of
BASF's coatings and colorings division.
   A three-member panel including an administrator from the
University of Cincinnati is to supervise a trust fund to pay for
the workers' training, the company said.

   Publisher James Hoge said Monday he is
determined to lure advertisers and readers back to the
strike-hampered Daily News and expects the tabloid to survive and
thrive.
   ``Absolutely. No question about it,'' Hoge said in an interview.
``We will prevail. We hope through settlement, but if not, without
it.''
   The man at the center of the 5{-week-old strike by 2,100
unionized employees said he is exploring options to take the paper
in new directions once the work force is stabilized.
   Before new plans can be carried out, he said, the strike must
end, profits must begin, and the work abuses the News has alleged
must be eliminated.
   As he sat in his eighth-floor office in midtown Manhattan, Hoge
spoke as if addressing the picketers on the sidewalk below:
``Fellows, get rid of the inefficiencies with us so we can build a
secure future for the next century.''
   The News recently spent $3 million to $4 million to select new
technology and design new printing plants to be built on land
bought in New Jersey and Long Island before the strike, the
publisher said.
   He said expansion options being weighed include creating either
an afternoon edition, a satellite-produced national edition or a
school edition. At least one was discussed at a Monday morning
meeting, he said, but he gave no further details.
   ``I wouldn't want to put a time on it now,'' Hoge said. ``We
have been chomping at the bit to be innovative and try to do things
when we think it's practical to do so and that includes variations
on what we do today.''
   The strike by nine unions, which began Oct. 25, has cost the
paper untold millions of dollars. It has been marked by incidents
of vandalism against News trucks and against news dealers who carry
the paper.
   The unions say the News engaged in unfair labor practices, which
the paper denies, and the News' parent, the Tribune Co. of Chicago,
is trying to break the unions, a charge Hoge denied Monday.
   Major advertisers have deserted the pages of what was, before
the strike, the nation's third-largest metropolitan daily, and have
fattened the pages of its tabloid rivals.
   Hoge estimated the paper's losses would total $200 million from
1979 to the end of this year, but he would not specify how much the
strike is costing. The News' vice president for human resources,
John T. Sloan, has said the paper expects to lose $30 million to
$35 million in this quarter.
   The paper has published every day during the strike, using
management, replacement workers and employees who crossed the
picket line. But circulation, which was 1.09 million on weekdays
before the strike, has dropped drastically.
   The News filed a civil racketeering suit against the striking
unions last week, claiming a pattern of orchestrated violence had
blocked the paper's distribution.
   The paper has used a system of hawkers, numbering more than
1,000, to help sell the paper.
   Under an agreement reached with the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority and enforced by court order, hawkers appeared Monday on
subway platforms and at commuter rail stations. Transit police said
there were no violent incidents.
   Hoge said the hawkers each day are given their 200,000 papers
free and are making 100 percent profit. That helps bring current
circulation to 525,000, Hoge said.
   ``Here it is a question of building back arduously piece by
piece the distribution system, and we are doing it,'' Hoge said.
``We went from about 400 sales outlets in the first 72 hours after
the strike to well over 4,000 now. We added over 900 last week.
We'll add more this week.''
  Hoge said he wants to get all parties to the negotiating table
and is willing to offer job buyouts if the unions are interested.
However, he reiterated the News' demand for an end to what it sees
as featherbedding and other labor abuses.
   ``I do not regret at all that we have in this generation faced
up to the issue that you have got to reform the contracts ...
because if we did not, the paper could not survive,'' Hoge said.
