<HEAD>Feds Settle Dispute Over Earthquake Money for Displaced Poor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government will pay nearly $25
million to counties hit by the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake to help
displaced poor people, officials said Thursday.
   Federal Emergency Management Agency officials backed out of a
similar agreement announced in February, saying it had been signed
under a misunderstanding.
   Legal Aid lawyers for the poor said the new settlement had been
approved by FEMA, high-level Justice Department officials and U.S.
District Judge Eugene Lynch.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney George Stoll confirmed the agreement was
reached, saying it was binding and the government should provide
funding quickly.
   ``We are confident they will not renege,'' said Morgan Gilhuly,
a volunteer San Francisco lawyer. ``This is a good deal for FEMA
and a good deal for people who lost their housing.''
   Under the settlement, FEMA is to distribute the funds to San
Francisco, Santa Cruz and Alameda counties, said Stepehn Ronfeldt
of Legal Aid Society of Alameda County.
   The funds will be distributed according to each county's
proportionate losses in low-income housing units.
   San Francisco planning official Carla Javits said the city would
use most of its money to renovate two centers providing 425 beds
and a variety of services to the homeless.
   Alameda County, which lost more than 1,100 residential hotel
rooms, will use some money for reconstruction and some for a newly
designed housing voucher program, said Rae Mary of the county's
Office of Community Development. Santa Cruz County has similar
plans, Ronfeldt said.

   Yes, Virginia, it's December already.
   In television land that means 'tis the season to beg your
parents for just one more viewing of ``Rudolph the Red Nosed
Reindeer'' while wading through an avalanche of prime-time holiday
specials.
   CBS boasts the oldest and most favored holiday fare, beginning
with the venerable ``Twas The Night Before Christmas,'' narrated by
Joel Grey, airing at 8 p.m. Dec. 8.
   The animated half-hour drawn from Clement Moore's poem was first
broadcast in 1974.
   On Dec. 10, CBS will rebroadcast ``The I Love Lucy Christmas
Special'' at 8:30 p.m. Lucy, Ricky, Ethel and Fred will be
colorized for portions of this year's special. The segment, shown
for the first time last season after being lost for 33 years,
flashes back to some classic ``Lucy'' episodes, including the birth
of Little Ricky.
   Charlie Brown and that poor, bedraggled Christmas tree trundle
back for the 25th anniversary of ``A Charlie Brown Christmas,''
(yes, Virginia, Snoopy and the gang first premiered in this
yuletide special in 1965), on Dec. 19 at 8:30 p.m.
   Charlie Brown will be preceded at 8 p.m. by 21-year-old ``Frosty
the Snowman,'' narrated by Jimmy Durante.
   CBS celebrates the holidays on its series with eight special
episodes of shows including ``Murphy Brown'' and ``The Trials of
Rosie O'Neill.'' In the latter, the recently divorced Rosie, played
by Sharon Gless, has her yuletide spirits dampened when she learns
her ex- and his new wife are going to midnight mass at her church.
   At NBC, the number of holiday programs is mind boggling. From
Bob Hope to the Chipmunks, NBC Christmas fare includes more than 20
specials and series episodes.
   Hope travels to Bermuda for a Dec. 15 Christmas show, broadcast
at 10 p.m., starring Dixie Carter of ``Designing Women'' and the
1991 Rose Queen. Alvin and the ``Chipmunks 30th Anniversary'' chirp
falsetto through another Christmas on Dec. 8 at 8 p.m.
   ``The Dreamer of Oz: The L. Frank Baum Story,'' airs Dec. 10 at
9 p.m., starring John Ritter and Annette O'Toole in a two-hour TV
movie chronicling the ``Wizard of Oz'' author's unlikely ascent to
fame.
   Holiday segments will appear on series including ``L.A. Law,''
Dec. 13, ``Quantum Leap,'' Dec. 14, ``Wings,'' Dec. 14 and
``Midnight Caller,'' Dec. 21.
   ABC has the fewest number of Christmas specials. Instead, the
network focused its holiday energies on making yuletide
installments of existing series.
   Dolly Parton takes viewers on a family reunion in the Smoky
Mountains at 9 p.m. on Dec. 21 with ``Dolly Parton: Christmas at
Home.''
   Teen-age sensations ``New Kids on the Block'' have their own
Christmas party Dec. 14 at 9 p.m.
   The 16-year-old whiz-kid title character of ``Doogie Howser,
M.D.'' tries to get out of a Christmas Eve hospital shift on Dec.
19, the ``Wonder Years' '' teen-age protagonist, Kevin, gets a
little bummed out when dad can't afford to buy the family a color
TV for Christmas and ``MacGyver'' spends the Dec. 10 episode
tracking down a statue of the (Biblical) Madonna.
   Fox Broadcasting Co. has a Dec. 21 Christmas episode of
``Against the Law'' and a Dec. 23 special installment of ``True
Colors.''
   After all this is over, Virginia, get ready for ``Dick Clark's
New Year's Rockin' Eve'' on ABC, when yes, once again, that guy who
has been around forever but never looks old stands in a horde of
crazed New Yorkers waiting for a fake apple to drop from Times
Square.

   Computers are challenging the sandbox and
easel in preschool programs across the country, although educators
have mixed opinions about introducing technology to toddlers.
   Youngsters should ``begin as early as possible to view computers
as a tool,'' said Suzanne Thouvenelle, vice president of an
Alexandria, Va., firm that developed software for young children.
   But John Lindley, principal of South Colby Elementary School in
Port Orchard, Wash., countered, ``Children need to be involved in
active learning. Computers are too passive. Computer introduction
to them is something they get too much of already and that's
television.''
   Even Bernard Gifford, vice president of education marketing for
Apple Computer Inc., acknowledged that computers in preschool may
be ``a bit too early.''
   ``I believe strongly in making it available to kids but I would
be reluctant to impose a structured program at that age. I think
the most important skills for youngsters at ages 3 and 4, frankly,
are social skills.''
   In a sampling of Head Start preschool classes around the
country, children used computers to create animals and plant
imaginary gardens. One program allowed them to combine facial
features on the computer while dictating stories to their teachers.
   The youngsters were so excited and motivated by the computers
that attendance improved, Thouvenelle said. Parents also showed a
greater interest in their children's work and enthusiastically
volunteered to work in the classroom.
   Walt Disney Computer Software, Inc. recently introduced a line
of software that had been tested at two Burbank, Calif.,
preschools. ``Nowhere on the package does it say educational
software,'' notes Sam Palahnuk, Walt Disney product developer.
``What we claim this stuff is a `fun exploratory software for your
kid.'''
   Fun is what 3-year-old Heather Leffler, 4-year-old Emily Koleini
and her 2-year-old brother Massoud were having during a
demonstration of the software at an upscale Virginia mall. With
parents nearby, the children watched in delight the colorful,
animated graphics of Mickey Mouse and his friends and listened to
the digitalized speech, fully orchestrated music and real-life
sound effects.
   The youngsters used numbers to help Mickey Mouse plan a birthday
party forGGoofy, named animals at a county fair with letters of the
alphabet, and identified shapes as Mickey performed magic acts.
   ``It certainly isn't boring,'' said Andrea Fleury of McLean,
Va., as she threatened to leave her 3-year-old, who had tinkered
with the computer for nearly two hours.
   ``We went for the approach `let kids really have fun and they'll
learn as a side effect,''' said Palahnuk. ``We don't want to claim
that it's going to teach your kid anything. We think it will, but
you start getting into teaching philosophy and curriculum and all
that kind of thing.''
   A study by the National Association of Elementary School
Principals found that elementary school children are more likely to
use computers in school than high school or college students, and
even 15 percent of kindergartners and preschoolers in the public
schools use computers.
   ``Research dating back to 1932 showed that technology as simple
as a typewriter had significant effects on the reading and writing
performance of elementary students,'' said James E. Dezel,
International Business Machines Corp. vice president. ``The
technology available to schools today and in the future could bring
about amazing results.''
   IBM sponsored the three-year study exploring classroom uses of
computers with children and parents in Head Start, a popular
federal preschool program that provides education, meals and health
screening for poor youngsters aged 3 through 5.
   Eleven of Head Start's 1,300 programs participated, including
four in Baltimore, Md., and one each in Winder, Ga., DeRidder, La.,
New York City, Lexington, Ky., Toledo, Ohio, Las Cruces, N.M., and
Dayton, Ohio.
   Head Start was used ``because of its emphasis on providing
equity for kids from low-income families,'' said Thouvenelle, vice
president of Mobius Corp., which developed new software after
evaluating the program.
   She said the software meets the guidelines of the National
Association for the Education of Young Children ``as being
developmentally appropriate.'' Association officials take no
position on computers in preschool.
   ``Our major concern was whether or not computers were
applicable, or would work for preschool children 3 and 4 years
old,'' said Thouvenelle. A second concern, she said, was whether
``young children can use computers as a tool the same way they use
blocks or easel painting.''
   Each of the 44 classrooms participating in the experiment had
two computers that shared a printer, mouse and a large,
touch-sensitive device known as the Powerpad. Thouvenelle said the
Powerpad is important to young children who often do not have the
fine motor skills needed to hold a pen or pencil.
   The computers ran a program called KidsWay, which came equipped
with voice cards in the native language of the parents of the
children who participated, such as Spanish, Navajo, Swahili and
Japanese.
   A key finding, said Thouvenelle, is that computers should be
available and accessible to youngsters in the classroom, the same
as reading materials, art work, blocks, sandbox and other so-called
learning center areas. Preschoolers should not be marched down the
hall to a computer laboratory, she said.
   She said a lack of teacher training and support remains a key
drawback to the program.
   Winnie Porter, a 12-year teaching veteran of kindergarten
through fifth grade in San Francisco, is against pushing academics
too early in kindergarten. Computers, she said, ``are good as long
as kids are allowed to explore with them and they are not forced on
them.''
   ``I think children could learn what they would learn from a
computer as they would learn from other things,'' said Pat
Wynne-Evans, who retired last year as a San Francisco teacher.
   With many school districts plagued by tight budgets, Lindley,
the South Colby principal, said, ``If I had to make a financial
decision between buying big blocks for $400-$500 and a computer for
$850, I'd go with the big blocks every time.
   ``Kids need active learning. Computers are not
multi-dimensional. Also you want children using their imagination,
rather than looking at a screen,'' Lindley said.

<DATELINE>ZASTAWIE, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In this dusty village, progress is not a
question of telephones or television. It is a matter of water.
   Stanislaw Szablowski and his neighbors had to truck water in
every day for years. Their wells were too shallow and tainted even
for their livestock and crops.
   Like more than 70 percent of Polish villages, Zastawie had no
running water. Recent Health Ministry tests of the farmyard wells
villagers depend on throughout Poland found the water in 67 percent
was too polluted to use.
   ``I don't have to tell you the impact of the lack of enough
clean water on the quality of life, on the amount of work for
women, on hygiene, on farm productivity,'' said Maria Stolzman, a
member of Parliament.
   Her Water Supply Foundation, led by the Roman Catholic Church,
helped Zastawie build a deep-well pumping station that brought
plentiful fresh water to the 31 farms in August.
   Poland's water crisis also affects urban areas, where more than
half the supply comes from surface water so contaminated that
experts say it should not have been collected in the first place.
Of the 4,500 Health Ministry tests made on city water systems in
1989, only 37.6 percent found good water.
   ``We are really struggling,'' said Eugenia Koblak-Kolinska,
deputy director of the Environment Ministry's water department.
   ``Everything that can be done on paper - regulations,
theoretical research, preparation of plans and progress - is
already worked out. What we lack is a way to put it into practice:
the new technologies ... the money.''
   Eastern Europe after communism is revealing a horror of
pollution that was created by heavy industry and untamed by concern
for the environment.
   The nations of the former Soviet bloc have neither the expertise
nor money to reverse the decades of destruction, and their efforts
for economic development often compete with environmental
protection.
   There is optimism, however, that the change to market economics
will provide governments newly focused on environmental hazards
with the ability to fight wanton polluters.
   Under the old system, state-owned factories subsidized by the
national treasury could afford the modest fines occasionally
imposed for pollution. The fines have been increased by up to 27
times, however, and will be much more important to industries
forced to survive in capitalist competition.
   ``Our minister made an ultimatum to a large group of factories:
Either you will do something for environmental protection ...
during a certain period of time, or the factory will cease to
exist,'' Mrs. Koblak-Kolinska said. ``The factories still cannot
believe that something like this might happen.''
   Pollution fighters look with some hope at offers from Western
nations to provide environmental help as part of their aid
programs.
   ``What they offer us - credits with very low interest and some
modern technologies - this is all very interesting,'' Mrs.
Koblak-Kolinska said, then added: ``But credits have to be paid
back.''
   Years of pollution of Poland's water supply are documented in
handwritten ledgers stacked in the Health and Environment
ministries.
   In Lomza province northeast of Warsaw, for example, only 6.6
percent of 280 wells tested in 1989 had acceptable water. In
Slupsk, a Baltic province, 40 percent of the 265 wells tested were
polluted.
   Communist officials did not act on the information or make it
public. A regime unable to provide jobs, housing and food tended to
dismiss environmental controls as luxuries.
   Under communist censorship, the information about polluted water
``might have been known to a certain very narrow circle of
people,'' said Alicja Lopatek, a Health Ministry sanitary
inspector, but it ``could not come into the open.''
   Reports by the Health and Environment ministries say:
   -Thirty-five percent of river water is not even fit for
industrial use. Poland's main river, the Vistula running from the
southern mountains to the Baltic, is unfit for any use for more
than half its length.
   -Warsaw is the only European capital without a sewage treatment
plant, and there are none in such other major cities as Lodz,
Bialystock and Radom.
   -Nearly half the 800 small cities and towns lack water
purification systems. Environmental officials estimate Poland needs
1,900 major sewage treatment plants in towns and cities and 8,300
in rural areas, at a total cost of $20 billion to $25 billion.
   -Half the nitrogen deposited in the Baltic comes from Poland,
along with a large share of other pollutants. Poland's Baltic
resorts are closed to swimmers and its fishing catch is
questionable. Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki said curbing the
pollution ``poses many problems'' and may even be ``unrealistic
without significant technological and financial support from
abroad.''
   -Water pumped from Poland's coal mines is so salty when it pours
into rivers that it kills biological life and corrodes machinery.
   Lack of purification systems exacerbates the health threat of
polluted water.
   ``The filter stations are old-fashioned,'' said Stanislaw
Sadanski, a Health Ministry water expert. Some were built in the in
the 1920s and 1930s, he said, and ``the one in Warsaw is 100 years
old.''
   Mrs. Lopatek of the ministry said: ``Local water systems ...
generally don't have any equipment for cleaning water, and the
worst situation is with the wells, public and private. Even on the
outskirts of Warsaw, people are using wells.''
   Shallow wells collect surface water that picks up chemicals,
human and animal waste and other contaminants. The answer is
deep-well water facilities with purification and sewage systems.
   ``If you are a mother with a child, it may be shocking to hear
the (pollution) standard is exceeded by 10 times, but if you have
no other water, what do you do?'' Sadanski said.

<HEAD>Crayola Has Another Surprise: Top Crayon Maker Colorblind</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Thursday AMs report; also on financial wire.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By KELLY P. KISSEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crayola company officials might be
turning a little red, make that fuchsia, with news that its top
crayon maker is colorblind.
   Emerson Moser, who is retiring next week after 35 years, isn't
colorblind in the sense that he can't see color at all. It's just
that some colors are confusing to him.
   That means trying to spot the difference between a cadet blue
and a blue green can make him feel, well, like a shrinking violet.
   ``If you have a serious case of it, you could foul up a lot of
materials,'' said Moser, 63, who has made a record 1.4 billion
crayons. His title at Binney &amp; Smith Co. is a crayon molder.
   As far as Moser and the company can tell, there's been no threat
of children coloring the sky green and the grass blue - unless they
were doing their Andy Warhol imitations.
   ``He's blue-green colorblind, but despite his handicap, he's
gone to the top of his trade,'' said Brad Drexler, spokesman for
the Easton-based company.
   Moser has made seas of salmon, pecks of plums and is a king
crayon craftsman, Drexler said. Tuesday, Moser made yards of yellow
and Wednesday, it was oodles of orange - colors that give Moser no
trouble.
   ``When you have shades of one color, you get a little doubt
about it. Before you go do anything, you double-check yourself,''
said Moser.
   It's the second technicolor shock to come out of the Crayola
plant this year. In August, it retired eight traditional colors
into the Crayola Hall of Fame.
   The company is asking Moser to donate his final pair of
ankle-high boots, splashed with the waxy colorful remains of his
time on the job, for inclusion in the hall.
   ``The colors splash a little bit when it comes out of the kettle
into the bucket,'' said Moser. ``People daily clean their shoes,
but I don't. I have a multicolored pair of shoes. It's probably
made them waterproof.
   ``This pair I have now ... there's yellow on them, because I
worked yellow today, and some orange and some red,'' Moser said in
a telephone interview Tuesday.
   A company doctor detected Moser's slight vision problem during a
physical conducted when he was hired Oct. 12, 1953, as a floor boy
in the packing department.
   ``It's so slight that if the doctor wouldn't have tested me, I
probably would have never noticed it,'' Moser said.
   Less than two years later, Moser graduated to the most colorful
job in the world, pouring molten wax into 2,400-crayon molds nearly
100 times a day. Once the wax is set, crayons are flicked out of
the racks and stacked in a bin for a conveyor belt to carry them to
a labeling machine.
   At Crayola, there are subtle shades of everything.
   But can anyone over age 12 really tell the difference between
violet and blue violet, cornflower and navy blue, blue green and
cadet blue, sepia and brown, orchid and thistle, or mulberry and
red violet?
   Other colors to worry about are the new shades of cerulean (a
type of blue), dandelion, fuchsia, jungle green, royal purple, teal
blue, vivid tangerine and wild strawberry. They replaced blue gray,
green blue, lemon yellow, maize, orange red, orange yellow, raw
umber and violet blue last summer.
   For less than obvious reasons, Moser likes the eight basic
Crayola colors: black, white, red, yellow, green, blue, brown and
orange. He even liked the eight retired colors, which now are
remembered only in 5-foot-tall models at the hall of fame.
   But Moser says there is no reason to wax nostalgic about
retiring the crayon colors.
   ``The new ones are nice. They really stand out when you color
with them,'' Moser said. ``The other colors were nice, too. You
grew up with them and got used to them, but you can't survive on
sentiment. Sentiment doesn't keep a company moving forward.''

<HEAD>Seattle Area Apartment Projects Delayed by Mismarked Lumber</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Thursday AMs report.</NOTE>

<BYLINE>By JIM KLAHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mismarked piece of lumber was a warning to Greg
Clarke that something was awry in the closely-guarded business of
grading wood for the construction industry.
   An angry Seattle lumber wholesaler telephoned Clarke's MacDonald
Inspection Services in Vancouver, British Columbia, early last
month.
   ``He found spruce lumber that was marked as hemlock,'' Clarke
said. ``The next day, we were down there.''
   Since then, a search for substandard lumber carrying
higher-grade marks has resulted in the closure by building
inspectors of dozens of apartment-building construction projects in
the Puget Sound area. Up to 60 projects have been shut down.
   While builders, inspectors and engineers have worked to ferret
out low-quality lumber and resume projects, the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police has started an investigation in British Columbia to
find the source of the mismarked wood.
   Costs to fix buildings are expected to run into the millions of
dollars. However, inspectors and builders said there were no safety
problems and the buildings would be built to code.
   ``We're not looking at this as a significant structural problem
right now,'' said Mike Dykeman, commercial inspection supervisor
for King County Building and Land Development.
   ``Rather than a health and safety issue, I think what we have is
a consumer fraud issue,'' Colin Quinn, Lincoln Property Co. vice
president, said Tuesday. Mislabeled studs were found in a new,
192-unit Lincoln apartment complex.
   Clarke and Tom Searles, executive vice president of the American
Lumber Standards Committee in Germantown, Md., said the mislabeled
lumber appeared to be limited to the Seattle area and to larger
construction jobs.
   The problem is with framing lumber generally considered No. 3
quality, but graded to indicate it is of No. 1 or No. 2 quality,
and with spruce marked as more desirable hemlock or fir.
   The lumber carries the MacDonald grading stamp, which is
registered and licensed to mills. Marking lower-quality wood a
higher grade can double its price.
   Searles said the case was the biggest he could remember.
   ``People have copied grade stamps before, but it's never been
this blatant,'' he said, adding that the international
lumber-grading system is zealously guarded and there have been few
cases of fraud.
   The most recent he could recall involved a truss plant in south
Florida several years ago, where the manufacturer had illegally
copied a stamp.
   Searles said the mismarked wood was ``a very small percentage in
the overall picture of things.''
   The United States building industry imports 12 billion to 14
billion board feet of lumber a year from Canada, Searles said.
Estimates of the mismarked timber involved range from 140,000 board
feet to millions of board feet.
   Dykeman said inspection agencies have asked builders to check
records, inspect buildings and dig through waste-wood piles in
search of suspect wood.
   In some instances, plumbing, electric wiring and wallboard have
had to be torn out to brace or replace mismarked lumber. The
biggest problems arise with joists, horizontal beams that support
floors or ceilings.
  Dykeman said some projects have been shut down for six weeks and
could be shut down eight more weeks.
   Quinn said the apartment builders would go to court to push the
losses they have sustained further up the chain of suppliers.
   In Canada, the Mounted Police has said little about its search
for culprits.
   Chris Perkins, investigating officer, declined to provide
details of the investigation, except to say it would be lengthy.
   MacDonald Inspection Services has retrieved its grading stamps
from two firms - Moga Timber Mill Ltd. and A.P. Timber Co., which
market lumber from a single mill in Surrey.
   The operations are owned by the Brar family. Brian Brar on
Monday denied any wrongdoing. ``We will not tolerate any claims
made against Moga or A.P. Timber,'' he said.
   Lumber carrying stamps licensed to the mill was sent to the job
sites in the Puget Sound area. However, it was shipped through
B.B.M. Lakeview Lumber Ltd. of Surrey, which had sold it to lumber
brokers in Seattle.
   B.B.M. Lakeview this week did not return phone calls to The
Associated Press. The company's attorney said earlier his company
was a victim and ``did nothing wrong.''
   In a separate case, B.B.M. Lakeview pleaded guilty May 6, 1988,
to defrauding the public in a case involving mismarked wood and was
fined $100,000.

   High over Hiroshima, a navigator in a B-29
recorded the world's introduction to the power and terror of
nuclear weapons.
   ``Bomb-Away - 09:15'' reads the simple entry from the
navigator's log for Aug. 6, 1945.
   The log from the top secret mission of the Enola Gay goes on the
auction block Friday - Pearl Harbor Day. Christie's auction house
expects it will attract a price of $100,000 to $150,000.
   ``I think, in looking at the log, you see in effect the world
moving from the pre-atomic into the atomic era. You see humanity
crossing a very profound boundary,'' said Chris Coover, a
manuscript specialist at Christie's.
   He said the timing of the sale - on the 49th anniversary of the
Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor - is a coincidence.
   But he said there was a ``historical symmetry'' to the attacks
on Pearl Harbor and Hiroshima, ``one marking the beginning of
hostilities and the other effectively the end of hostilities.''
   But Martin Sherman, director of the Nuclear Age History and
Humanities Center at Tufts University, called it ``an unfortunate
date.''
   ``It implies an appropriateness about Hiroshima - sort of a
balance on the scales of justice,'' he said. ``They attacked us so
we gave them any eye for an eye, so to speak, which is completely
inappropriate and historically inaccurate.''
   In the attack on Pearl Harbor, 18 U.S. ships were sunk or
severely damaged, about 170 planes were destroyed and the American
casualties numbered about 3,700. There were 130,000 casualties at
Hiroshima.
   Christie's is selling the log for the widow of Capt. Robert A.
Lewis, co-pilot of the Enola Gay. Eileen Lewis hopes she can retire
on the sale price and wants no publicity herself, Coover said.
   ``She is very concerned she is going to catch all kinds of hate
mail and flak for putting this up for sale,'' Coover said.
   The log recorded the Enola Gay's basic flight information -
position, altitude, air speed, compass direction - on three yellow,
oblong sheets during the 12-hour roundtrip mission between the U.S.
base in the Marianas Islands and Hiroshima.
   The bomber, with 12 people aboard, left Tinian Island at 2:45
a.m. The pilot was Col. Paul Tibbets, commanding officer of the
509th Composite Group, which had been specially trained for the
mission.
   Tibbets selected Lewis, a Brooklyn native, as his co-pilot.
Lewis was one of the most experienced B-29 pilots in the Air Force;
he had survived two crashes, and had a reputation for remaining
calm in moments of stress.
   In the plane's bomb bay rested a single 9,000-pound uranium
bomb. Tibbets carried cyanide capsules to distribute to each man if
the plane experienced engine failure or was shot down.
   The log was recorded in Tinian time - one hour ahead of the time
in Hiroshima - by navigator Theodore S. van Kirk. At 5:55 a.m. he
noted ``Iwo'' in the left-hand column, as the Enola Gay
rendezvoused with two other B-29s near Iwo Jima.
   At 8:30 a.m., the notation ``I.F.F. off'' appears; the plane's
radar identification gear was turned off to prevent any
interference with the bomb's detonation devices.
   At about this time, Tibbets decided on the mission's primary
target, Hiroshima, over secondary choices Nagasaki and Kokura.
   At 9:12 a.m., the bomber was 12 miles from its target. In the
right-hand column of the log, the navigator wrote, ``Eight large
ships in harbor at Mishima.''
   The bomb-bay doors opened three minutes and 17 seconds later.
``Bomb-Away - 09:15,'' reads the log entry. Within a minute, 80,000
people were instantly killed or seriously wounded. Two-thirds of
the city was destroyed in the now-familiar mushroom cloud.
   ``If I live a hundred years, I'll never quite get these few
minutes out of my mind,'' Lewis wrote in notes that a New York
Times reporter asked him to keep during the Hiroshima mission.
   Asked how the co-pilot came to have the navigator's log, Coover
said only that he got it from ``someone in the squadron.''
   Lewis, who died in 1983 at age 65, kept the log in a safe
deposit box.

   What flagrant exhibitionism, what terrible
identity crisis, what suicidal yearnings would compel a middle-aged
man to wriggle into a woman's dress and brave the taunts of 56,000
howling fans at a Washington Redskins football game?
   Michael Torbert stood thoughtfully at his front-row seat at the
50-yard line at RFK Stadium. He fluffed his bright yellow tresses,
smoothed the wrinkles from his polka-dot skirt and sniffed through
his plastic hog snout.
   ``Hey, priests have been wearing dresses for years, right?'' he
said. ``We just add a little color.''
   Torbert and his pot-bellied buddies are familiar to millions of
TV football viewers as the ``Hogettes,'' the unofficial Redskins
cheerleaders who go hog-wild every Sunday afternoon in gaudy wigs
and skirts, floppy hats and pink snouts.
   ``Our designer is Calvin Swine,'' says Ralph Campbell, who wears
a bleached-blonde wig and ruffled yellow dress with red Hogette
sash across his ample waist. A retired Navy helicopter mechanic,
he's known as ``the pretty one.''
   These bearded bimbos have nicknames like ``Pork Chop'' and ``Big
Georgette'' and ``Peewee.'' They boast an average weight of 243
pounds, nurtured by plenty of hot dogs and beer. They like to chew
on huge plastic cigars.
   And when the Redskins are rolling toward a touchdown, they wave
their parasols and hoist their beefy legs over the railing,
bellowing encouragement.
   Torbert organized the Hogettes in 1983 to lead cheers for the
``Hogs,'' the nickname of the Redskins' offensive linemen, and to
raise money for their favorite children's charities.
   The Hogettes range in age and occupation from a 28-year-old mail
carrier to a 59-year-old retired civilian employee of Army
intelligence. Torbert, 45, an Energy Department engineer and
longtime Redskins fan, said all the Hogettes are devoted fathers
and civic activists.
   Since 1983, he said, the Hogettes have helped raise $30 million
for sick and underprivileged children by appearing at golf
tournaments, telethons, parades and other charity benefits at their
own expense.
   Each of the 11 regular Hogettes spends as much as $1,000 out of
pocket to attend Redskins games and log about 5,000 miles traveling
to more than 100 fund-raising events every year, Torbert estimated.
   Their 17 beneficiaries include Children's Hospital in
Washington, the Ronald McDonald House and a rural Virginia summer
camp for young cancer patients.
   ``I didn't have a dress in my closet for the first 40 years,''
said George Maxfield, alias ``Big Georgette.''
   ``My mom didn't raise me that way. But I'd do anything to raise
money for these kids,'' he said.
   Campbell, who's nickname is ``Grandpa,'' says he has no qualms
about looking foolish in a woman's skirt, ``if it brings smiles to
the kids' faces and makes some money for the sick ones.''
   The Hogettes have stolen dresses from their mothers' closets and
learned how to drink beer without getting their hog snouts wet.
   They've been pelted with ice and game programs. They've had
their snouts pulled back and snapped in their faces. Shouts of
``You're mighty cute!'' and ``What are you doing after the game?''
are commonplace.
   They take personal bodyguards when they travel to Philadelphia
to protect them against violence. ``We know how the Israelis feel
when we attend an Eagles game - four of us surrounded by an armed
camp,'' Torbert said.
   The Hogettes have endured not only icy stadium winds but more
than a few surprise pinches on their tushes from playful fans.
   Maxfield, who stands 6-feet-4, remembers a particularly painful
grab at the Hogettes' first Super Bowl at Tampa, Fla., in January
1984.
   ``I was going up into the stands for lunch when somebody hogged
down on my right cheek big-time,'' he said. ``I swung around, and
it was a woman who must have been at least 7 feet tall.
   ``She said, `I'm sorry, I just couldn't resist.' I said, `If it
turns you on, feel free.' So darned if she didn't do it again -
real hard - and I almost went to the emergency room to see if she'd
torn a chunk out of me.''

<HEAD>Study Disputes Notion that Infertility is on the Increase</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Infertile couples are flocking to clinics,
joining self-help groups and lobbying Congress for help. But
contrary to popular perception, a new study says there is no
infertility epidemic.
   ``The overall rate of infertility didn't change between 1982 and
1988,'' said William Mosher, a statistician who co-authored the
federal report. ``This is another chapter in the life story of the
baby boom, whose members have affected American society at every
stage of their lives.''
   One out of 12 women had an impaired ability to have children in
both 1982 and 1988, a steady rate of 8.4 percent, according to the
report by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 1988 that
rate translated into 4.9 million women aged 15 to 44.
   The infertility rate for married couples actually fell from 8.5
percent in 1982 to 7.9 percent or 2.3 million couples in 1988.
   Nevertheless, said Mosher and co-author William Pratt, some
popular descriptions of infertility have suggested there are 9
million to 10 million infertile couples, or that one in six couples
is infertile, fertility is increasing rapidly or there is an
``epidemic'' of infertility in the United States.
   Not true, Mosher and Pratt said, based on their analysis of the
1982 and 1988 National Surveys of Family Growth. In fact, the
surveys found that the percentage of women with fertility problems
has decreased among baby boom women aged 25 to 44.
   Still, the authors said, infertility problems are plaguing more
people now than ever before, due to the aging of the outsized baby
boom generation and its propensity to delay childbearing.
   The number of childless women aged 35 to 44 jumped 64 percent
over the six-year period in the study. And while the percentage of
those with fertility problems did not change, the sheer size of the
group added to the number afflicted - 620,000 in 1988, up from
454,000 in 1982.
   Mix those statistics with an explosion in infertility treatments
and doctors trained in the field. Stir in a heavy dose of news
coverage, including letters to syndicated advice columnists like
Ann Landers. Voila: a trend.
   ``As the technology progresses, more stories are out and more
people are learning about the availability of options. More people
are seeking services and subsequently receiving help,'' said Joyce
Zeitz, a spokeswoman for the 10,000-member American Fertility
Society in Birmingham, Ala.
   But Zeitz said her group never expected the report, the first
national fecundity estimate of all 57.9 million women of
reproductive age, regardless of marital status, to document rampant
rises in infertility.
   ``At one point, we thought that with the aftermath of the IUD
(intrauterine device) problems and the prevalence of sexually
transmitted diseases, we might see a slight increase'' in the
infertility rate, she said. ``In the overall scheme, that was
probably not as significant as we thought it was going to be. But
we never really felt there was going to be an epidemic.''
   Even without the rapid rise some had anticipated, Zeitz said the
disorder remains a serious concern.
   ``We're still talking about 2.3 million couples, 4.9 million
women who have a problem,'' she said. ``We still need more
research, better contraceptives, better insurance coverage, better
lab regulation.''
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., is pushing a number of those
concerns in Congress. One of her bills led to money this year for
the National Institutes of Health to establish several
contraceptive and infertility research centers around the country.
   Mrs. Schroeder plans to reintroduce next year a bill that would
earmark federal money for programs that screen and treat women for
sexually transmitted diseases, a leading cause of infertility.
Another proposal would require federal employees' insurance
policies, if they offer pregnancy benefits, to also cover
infertility treatment and medical or counseling expenses related to
adoption.
   Mosher said the focus on infertility, and the visibility its
victims have gained, is not surprising.
   ``Whatever the baby boom is concerned with gets attention,'' he
said. ``When they were in their late 20s they started buying houses
and pushed up the demand for housing. Now they have children or are
trying to have children, so infertility, adoption and child care
are issues. When they retire, retirement and Social Security will
be the issues.''

<HEAD>Cancer Gene's Role Identified in Worm, Could Aid Cancer Research</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A gene that aids development of a sex organ in a
worm may lead to new insights into human cancer, scientists
reported.
   Researchers have discovered that it is a so-called ``ras'' gene,
a type linked to several cancers, and have figured out one of its
normal roles in the worm.
   Those advances will give scientists their first chance to use a
living animal to determine the details of what a ras gene does and
how it is controlled, commented Princeton University scientist
James Broach.
   ``We're going to have a big explosion in our understanding of
what ras does in the biology of an organism,'' Broach said. ``We
anticipate ... we'll be able to understand all the players that
`talk' to ras and that ras interacts with.''
   That may illuminate the process by which a ras gene promotes
cancer, revealing new targets for therapeutic drugs, Broach said.
   However, any such payoff would be a long way in the future,
cautioned H. Robert Horvitz, a biology professor at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an investigator at the
Howard Hughes Medical Institute there.
   Ras genes normally help control cell growth and development, but
little is known about how they do that, or how they are regulated.
Abnormal ras genes are frequently observed in pancreatic, lung,
colon and blood cell cancers.
   In today's issue of the British journal Nature, Horvitz and
colleagues describe the ras gene's role in development of female
genitalia in a worm called Caenorhabditis elegans.
   The worm gene, called let-60, was identified as a ras gene by
Paul Sternberg and Min Han of the California Institute of
Technology in research reported last Friday in the journal Cell.
   In the Nature paper, scientists report that let-60 acts as a
switch, controlling signals that are supposed to tell cells to form
genitalia called the vulva.
   The researchers showed that if let-60 is mutated such that it
cannot be activated, the cells fail to form genitalia when they
receive the signals. In contrast, if let-60 is mutated such that it
is always ``turned on,'' the cells will form a vulva even without
any signal to do so.
   Scientists also found that mutations that permanently activate
let-60 resemble a mutation linked to cancer in humans. Such
permanent activation of ras is what occurs in the human cancers
with which it is associated, Horvitz said.

<HEAD>Bargainers Working on Final Aspects of Nuclear Arms Treaty</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S. and Soviet negotiators, aiming toward an
early 1991 summit in Moscow, are tackling the remaining obstacles
to a treaty on strategic weapons.
   After clearing away three major roadblocks to the Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty, or START, officials say experts from both sides
will meet Friday in Washington to work on remaining technical
issues. They involve inspections to verify treaty compliance and
telemetry data from ballistic missile testing.
   Those areas of disagreement still could block completion of the
treaty, but one U.S. official said they ``are not enough for anyone
to fall on their sword over.''
   The negotiators have made significant progress over the past
month by agreeing to limit Soviet Backfire bombers that would be
outside the START treaty itself; to allow U.S. nuclear programs
with Britain to continue; and to restrict the launch and payload
weight of the Soviets' modernized, ground-based SS-18 missiles,
said an official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The White House is holding off on preparations for President
Bush's trip to Moscow, anticipated for January, saying the
president will go only if the START treaty is ready to sign.
   The treaty aims to cut U.S. and Soviet long-range nuclear
weapons by 30 percent, scrapping hundreds of warheads.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze will meet in Houston next Monday and
Tuesday to hash out the remaining issues, and Shevardnadze will fly
to Washington to meet with Bush on Wednesday.
   On the three big stumbling blocks recently resolved:
   -The United States agreed that the Soviet Backfire bomber can be
counted separately from the overall START limits of 1,600 heavy
bombers and ballistic missiles the Soviets are allowed to retain,
said an official close to the talks.
   The source declined to say how many Backfires would be permitted
under the politically binding letter that will be outside the
treaty itself. The Soviets have an estimated 355 Backfires now,
according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a
London-based think tank.
   -The Soviets agreed to continued U.S. nuclear programs with
Britain as long as those programs are not seen as upsetting the
overall strategic balance. The cooperation primarily involves
technology and missiles the United States provides for British
submarines.
   -The negotiators agreed that any modernized SS-18 could not have
the capability to carry heavier payloads, including warheads, than
the current SS-18. The treaty, however, would not limit
modernization such as improved accuracy or fuel efficiency, or
alteration in the types of warheads.
   Under the pact, the Soviets would cut the number of SS-18s by
half to 154.
   U.S. officials said the remaining issues involve:
   -Monitoring of production facilities for mobile ballistic
missiles. The two nations disagree on where in the missile
construction process the monitoring should be allowed. The United
States wants assurances for early inspection of Soviet SS-24
missiles, which have 10 warheads, while the Soviets have insisted
that inspection of final assembly is sufficient.
   -To what extent each side must provide uncoded telemetry from
testing of ballistic missiles so that the other can interpret the
data and verify compliance with the treaty's restrictions on
missile performance.
   -Whether the Soviets will be allowed to inspect the B-2 bomber
to ensure it is not equipped to carry long-range cruise missiles
armed with nuclear warheads.

   The Commerce Department approved more than 20
shipments of bacteria and other biological agents in recent years
to Iraq and Syria, a congressional lawyer says.
   U.S. experts said that while the agents could be intended for
medical purposes, they also could be used to develop biological
weapons. Both countries are believed to be developing such lethal
arsenals.
   As a result of the shipments, Iraq could end up using
U.S.-supplied goods against American soldiers if war breaks out in
the Persian Gulf, said Ted Jacobs, chief counsel of the House
subcommittee on commerce, consumer and monetary affairs.
   ``We never thought that Iraq would be so dangerous,'' said Peter
Chalfont, secretary of the Wiltron Co. of Morgan Hills, Calif.,
which sold $45,000 in electronic test measuring equipment to Iraq
in 1987. ``It's easy to say in hindsight that maybe the license
shouldn't have been approved.''
   The Bush administration has indicated growing concern about
Iraq's dangerous chemical and biological weapons since U.S. troops
moved into the gulf region in August to try to force Saddam
Hussein's forces out of Kuwait. American troops routinely don
special anti-gas suits as part of their readiness drills and carry
antidotes to counter poison gas.
   Jacobs said he has obtained information showing that the
Commerce Department has approved about half of the license
applications for shipments to the Atomic Energy Commissions of Iraq
and Syria over the last three years.
   The subcommittee has issued a subpoena to Undersecretary of
Commerce Dennis Kloske to testify about the sales to Iraq and
Syria, after the Commerce Department refused repeated requests for
additional information and stalled on others, said Jacobs.
   The department approved licenses worth $700 million to Iraq over
a three-year period ending Oct. 1, Jacobs said. Licenses were
required because all these goods were ``dual use items,'' meaning
they could be used either for peaceful or lethal purposes.
   Syria is under greater export restrictions than Iraq because it
is one of seven nations listed by the administration as supporters
of terrorism. Still, the Commerce Department approved 120 out of
251 applications between Oct. 1987, and Oct. 1, 1990, according to
information obtained by Jacobs.
   The approval rate, as well as information about the types of
items sold to Syria, was first disclosed by the Washington Jewish
Week newspaper.
   Jacobs said he had received limited information from the
Commerce Department that showed more than 20 shipments of bacteria,
protozoa and fungi from one U.S. company to a post office box in
Baghdad used by that nation's Atomic Energy Commission. The agency
is a government purchasing arm for weapons and technology.
   The Commerce Department declined to release the names of any
companies granted export licenses, citing a law that defends firms'
proprietary interests. A spokeswoman at the department's Bureau of
Export Administration declined to discuss Jacobs' allegations on
the same grounds.
   Most U.S. exports of biological agents require Commerce
Department approval because of the possibility they could be
diverted for non-peaceful use.
   The department, in its annual 1990 report to Congress regarding
export control measures, said applications to export such agents
``will generally be denied for Iran, Iraq, Syria and Libya.''
   A company that sold the agents to Iraq and Syria said it was
told the germs would be used to manufacture vaccines, said a
source, who asked not to be identified. But, the source said, an
expert could manipulate these germs to create a stronger, lethal
strain.
   The recipient of the biological agents in Damascus was also the
Atomic Energy Commission, said Jacobs.
   Jacobs said the Syrian commission also was sold a U.S.
oscilloscope. The device is used to measure electric impulses, and
a high-speed version is vital in the development of ballistic
missiles and other weapons.
   A California-based company, Techtronics, has said it sold an
oscilloscope to Iraq last year, but Jacobs said he did not know
whether it also sold the device to Syria.
   The Commerce Department also approved the sales of electronic,
optic and photographic equipment to Syria's Atomic Agency
Commission, Jacobs said.
   The total value of the goods licensed to Syria over the past
three years was $25.5 million, according to a letter from Commerce
Undersecretary Kloske to the chairman of Jacobs' subcommittee, Rep.
Doug Barnard, D-Ga.
   The Nov. 16 letter, parts of which were obtained by The
Associated Press, said most of the export applications were
referred to expert opinions at the State, Defense and Energy
departments.
   The Commerce Department's 1990 export control report said most
of the goods licensed for Syria were computer-related items
primarily for use in the country's petroleum industry.
   But critics say the use of much of the equipment in Syria, an
authoritarian state where the government controls all industry,
cannot be monitored. And they point to Iraq as an example of a
country where U.S. goods are known to have been used to manufacture
weapons.

   French designer Pierre Cardin says he
plans to produce and sell his coveted garb in this fashion-deprived
land, where shops still stock poor-quality, drab and utilitarian
clothes.
   Cardin worked out details of an agreement Wednesday in a meeting
with Premier Petre Roman. He is to open a boutique selling his line
in Bucharest by next September. Shops in other large towns are also
to open.
   Under dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, who was executed in last
year's revolution, outlandish Western fashions were actively
discouraged by the secret police. Youths caught in hippie or punk
garb were frequently arrested.
   Cardin told a news conference Wednesday that he intends to
license the manufacture of his products to local companies and
acould also open a branch of his Maxim's restaurant chain in
Bucharest.
   He already has cooperative ventures in Hungary, the Soviet Union
and China.
   Cardin-label ties, shoes and shirts are popular - and expensive
- on the Romanian black market. The designer said the new boutiques
would sell clothes ``a lot cheaper than in the West.''
   The government will pay Cardin $298,000 as a first-stage
compensation for his efforts, said Textile Industry Minister
Corneliu Zaharia.

   ``Cornet Rilke's Song of Love and Death'' is a
beautiful opera by Siegfried Matthus.
   An hour and a half long, it was given its American premiere by
students of the Manhattan School of Music.
   When Matthus, called the most often performed living German
opera composer, had his first American opera debut, of ``Judith,''
last summer in Santa Fe, N.M., he was an East German. He attended
both that premiere and ``Cornet Rilke'' on Wednesday night here.
   ``Judith,'' depicting a story from biblical times, is exceeding
tense, musically and dramatically. ``Cornet Rilke,'' though Matthus
means it as an anti-war piece, soars with youth and promise and
lovely melodies.
   The students all had pleasing voices, capable of singing the
music. But almost none of the English translation was
understandable except that of the 30-member chorus. David Gilbert
conducted the orchestra of 15.
   Matthus bases his opera on an 1899 epic poem by Rainer Maria
Rilke about a person in his family tree who died at 18 fighting the
Turks. Since the opera reopened the Dresden opera house in 1985,
burned 40 years before, Matthus begins it with the chorus singing
``On such a night there once was a fire,'' a lament for the opera
house and for the young Rilke.
   Tattered curtains pull away, showing the youth's body on the
ground. Staging, using a diagonal ramp and imaginative lighting,
was telling, throughout. Near the end, the chorus holds pieces of
wall which reflect the fire.
   The opera is in a number of concise scenes, each ending in
blackout. Every detail and bit of music works toward the whole
effect. At first, soldiers on their way to battle make horseback
riding motions as they sing, putting a foot down, then bending
their knees twice before stepping again. They sing of mothers and
wives, at one point are met by tarts.
   Rilke finds a man's body, a woman tied to a tree, is promoted to
cornet, meaning standard bearer. The part is written for a woman;
women's light voices sound younger than tenors. Christine Abraham
sang Rilke and Lisa Livingston, walking behind like a shadow, sang
a larger part, Rilke's thoughts.
   The soldiers are given a party at a castle and the countess
seduces Rilke.
   The next morning, the boy, joyfully awakened to the
possibilities of adulthood, grabs the flag and runs into battle,
where he is stabbed to death.
   Musical styles change depending on moods of scene. Sometimes,
there is melody in the orchestra but modern-sounding angularities
for the singers. The love scene's music is tenderly melodic instead
of passionate. At the end, drums roll.

<HEAD>Blood Donors to be Quizzed About Personal Lives</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blood banks will have to ask a broader range
of personal questions of would-be donors under new regulations that
recognize the growing spread of AIDS among heterosexuals.
   The new policy, announced Wednesday, also ends the ban on
donations from Haitians and eases the ban on donations from natives
of sub-Saharan African nations.
   The Haitian government called for a ``massive program of
re-educating Americans'' about a policy it said has ruined that
country's tourism industry, cost thousands of jobs and caused
Haitian children to be ``snubbed and taunted.''
   The regulations should be implemented at all blood
``establishments,'' including Red Cross centers, within a few
months, said Brad Stone, a spokesman for the Food and Drug
Administration, which oversees the safety of blood supplies.
   ``The strengthened program will enhance, rather than replace,
the current procedures used to safeguard the blood supply,'' Health
and Human Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan said in a statement.
   The changes ``will eliminate the need for excluding certain
donor populations based solely on their geographical or national
origins,'' he said.
   Under the new regulations, all potential donors will be
questioned orally as well as in writing, using terminology that is
understandable, ``culturally sensitive'' and avoids sexual
stereotyping, the announcement said.
   Potential donors will be asked about all high-risk behavior, and
will be asked direct questions about whether they have been treated
for syphilis or gonorrhea within the last year.
   The exclusion for potential donors who have either paid for or
sold sex will be extended from six months to a year.
   The exclusion for people who have received transfusions of blood
or blood products will be extended from six months to one year.
This change aims at reducing the risk of hepatitis C, another
blood-borne disease.
   Haitians were singled out in 1982, early in the AIDS epidemic,
because scientists found a higher-than-usual incidence of infection
among Haitian heterosexuals.
   The policy originally covered only Haitians who came to this
country after 1977 but was extended this year to cover all
Haitians, many of whom had fled to this country to escape political
persecution.
   Closer investigation determined that the occurrence of AIDS
among Haitians was due to the same risky behavior as among the
population at large and there was no connection with national
origin.
   ``The focus that is resulting from the secretary's decision
would seem to be quite appropriate,'' said Dr. S. Gerald Sanders,
director of medical services for the American Red Cross.
   The number of AIDS cases associated with heterosexual contact
rose from 755 in 1988-1989 to 1,026 in the next reporting period,
Sanders said, quoting statistics from the Centers for Disease
Control. That jump from 2 percent of all AIDS cases to 3 percent in
a single year is statistically significant, he said.
   Verbal screening of prospective donors is important because
testing of the blood supply has a gap: the AIDS antibodies do not
appear for up to six months after infection.
   Sanders said the screening is reliable because the kind of
people to take the time out to donate blood do not want to hurt
others and the process is anonymous.
   The policy continues the ban on donations from black Africans
unless they can be tested for a form of the AIDS virus, HIV-2, that
is endemic in West Africa. Such tests have been developed but are
not widely used in the United States.

   Arnold Schwarzenegger says Hollywood's
in-the-know were sure his Austrian accent and 14-letter surname
would keep him from stardom.
   ``They were right when they said no one with an accent has made
it, or made it with a name like that,'' Schwarzenegger said in an
interview scheduled for broadcast today on the Fox program
``Personalities.''
   ``But I didn't feel that ought to be an obstacle, and I went
ahead and did it anyway, thinking I could use all those things to
my advantage.''
   Schwarzenegger, who has starred in such action films as
``Terminator'' and ``Predator'' and whose latest film,
``Kindergarten Cop,'' is soon to be released, said he made it
because America ``is the land of opportunities.''
   ``This is the place where you still can make your dreams become
reality if you're willing to work hard and if you have a positive
attitude,'' he said.

   LONDON (AP) - Salman Rushdie came out of hiding for a
book-signing at a London bookshop.
   The ``Satanic Verses'' author was accompanied by bodyguards but
looked relaxed Wednesday as he signed 100 copies of his new book,
``Haroun and the Sea of Stories.'' The children's fantasy was
written during his two years in hiding.
   ``There were a lot of customers doing double-takes when they
came into the shop and saw him,'' said store manager David
McRedmond. ``We were only given brief notice that he was coming and
were a bit surprised he was coming out at all.''
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini sentenced the Indian-born British
writer to death two years ago for allegedly blaspheming Islam with
``The Satanic Verses.''

   NEW YORK (AP) - Billy Joel says he may be a little old to be on
the road for 16 months, but he needs the money.
   ``I was beyond broke. I was looking into the abyss,'' the
41-year-old singer-songwriter said Wednesday on ABC's ``Good
Morning America.''
   He claims in a lawsuit that his former manager misspent or stole
millions in earnings.
   Joel said the tour to promote his triple-platinum album ``Storm
Front'' has affected his relationship with his 4-year-old child,
Alexa Ray.
   ``Having a child and not being there, that has hurt the most,''
he said. ``And that's the thing that makes me the most bitter about
this situation. They've taken away a certain amount of time I
wanted to spend with my child.''
   The tour, which began last December, ends in March.

   AKRON, Ohio (AP) - Garrison Keillor remembers the backstage
entrances rather than the facades when he recalls theaters he's
visited.
   ``The way that theaters are memorable is if you come in from the
other way,'' the humorist said in Tuesday's Akron Beacon Journal.
``The backstages are always kind of grungy, like somebody's
basement. I always find that comforting.''
   Keillor's ``American Radio Company'' show on Saturday will be
broadcast live nationwide on public radio from the Akron Civic
Theater, which he last saw in 1985.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Keye Luke, who was Charlie Chan's No. 1 son

   The star unveiled Wednesday in honor of the 85-year-old actor
was the 1,925th dedicated.
   Luke played in some 150 film, including 13 Charlie Chan movies,
``Gremlins,'' ``The Good Earth'' and ``Love is a Many Splendored

   NEW YORK (AP) - Producer Cameron Mackintosh, who once canceled
the Broadway version of the hit London musical ``Miss Saigon'' over
ethnic casting, may be in for another squabble with an actors'
union over a role in the show.
   Mackintosh needs the permission of Actors' Equity for Filipino
actress Lea Salonga to play Kim, a Vietnamese bargirl, in the
Broadway production. The union has a veto over foreign actors
performing in the United States.
   No date has been set for a union committee to consider the
request, said union spokeswoman Helaine Feldman.
   Mackintosh battled the union last summer when it barred the
white actor Jonathan Pryce from playing a Eurasian, saying such
casting would be an insult to Asian actors. The producer then
canceled the show but changed his mind when the union relented.
   ``Miss Saigon,'' set during the closing days of the Vietnam War,
has sold a record $30 million in advance tickets. It opens on
Broadway in April.

   ORONO, Maine (AP) - The University of Maine student newspaper
says it has decided to avoid a long legal battle and abandon its
attempt to republish columns written 20 years ago by Stephen King.
   Doug Vanderweide, editor of the Maine Campus, said Wednesday the
decision was made after an ``extremely amiable'' phone conversation
with the best-selling horror writer, who lives in nearby Bangor.
   King had objected to republication of columns he wrote while he
was a student at the university. He said he found the columns
embarrassingly juvenile.
   Vanderweide said protracted litigation with King, who has long
been supportive of the university, would be ``personally
distasteful.''
   ``I think it's best to be fair to the man,'' Vanderweide said,
``and the way to be fair to him is just to let this issue slide.''

   GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) - A now run-down house President Ford
once lived in was sold at auction for $3,000.
   George Dennis of Grand Rapids and three partners sucessfully bid
on the home, where Ford lived from 1923 until 1930, when he was 17.
The City Commission was expected to give final approval to the bid
as early as next week.
   The house has been vacant for 20 years. Officials at the Grand
Rapids Public Museum, which was named caretaker after the city
acquired it from the Veterans Administration in 1971, estimates
renovations will cost $51,000.

   In four months, the Bush administration has
reversed itself on whether economic pressure can force Saddam
Hussein to give up his conquest of Kuwait.
   The president and his people have gone from saying sanctions
might work, to saying sanctions were biting, to saying they won't
do the job.
   The turning point - the assertion that sanctions won't budge
Saddam - came abruptly this week, after last week's United Nations
vote imposing a Jan. 15 deadline for withdrawing.
   Just as President Bush and his advisers began publicly
abandoning hope on the worth of sanctions, others found them to be
a promising alternative to war if given time to work.
   Two former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force Gen.
David Jones and Adm. William Crowe, told the Senate Armed Services
Committee last week that sanctions could achieve their goal in 12
to 18 months.
   ``It is dead wrong to say that Iraq is not being hurt,'' Crowe
testified. ``It is being damaged severely. ... The issue is not
whether an embargo will work, but whether we have the patience to
let it take effect.''
   Former Defense Secretary James Schlesinger said sanctions
already had reduced Iraq's economic activity by 40 percent.
Democrats generally endorsed those views.
   After Bush imposed sanctions on Aug. 2, the day Saddam's army
took over Kuwait, he expressed increasing confidence that economic
pressure, supported worldwide, would force Saddam back.
   Eight days after the invasion, Bush told reporters, ``Listen,
I'd love to see the economic sanctions be so successful that the
(U.S.) forces could be withdrawn. And I think they will be
successful. But I just can't - my problem is, I just can't estimate
the time right now, how long it will take.''
   Five days later, addressing Defense Department employees during
a visit to the Pentagon, Bush said, ``Sanctions are working.''
   And the following day, after meeting Jordan's King Hussein at
Kennebunkport, Maine, the president said sanctions were taking
hold. ``I don't think one can sustain true international isolation
for long, especially when you depend on the outside world for a lot
of your goods,'' he said.
   On Aug. 28, briefing members of Congress, the president said:
``The United Nations sanctions are in effect and have been working
remarkably well, even on a voluntary basis.''
   And on Sept. 11, in an address to a joint session of Congress:
   ``Iraq is feeling the heat. We continue to hope that Iraq's
leaders will recalculate just what their aggression has cost them.
They are cut off from world trade, unable to sell their oil. And
only a tiny fraction of goods gets through. ... I cannot predict
just how long it will take to convince Iraq to withdraw from
Kuwait. Sanctions will take time to have their full intended
effect.''
   Then, last Thursday, at the United States' behest, the Security
Council authorized the use of force after Jan. 15 to compel Iraq's
expulsion from Kuwait.
   Almost at once, the administration line on sanctions changed.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney was first. ``There is no guarantee
that sanctions will force him (Saddam) out of Kuwait,'' he
testified Monday. ``He can ride them out.''
   Bush, visiting Uruguay on Tuesday, elaborated on the new theme.
   ``I've not been one who has been convinced that sanctions alone
will bring him to his senses,'' he said, while adding that the
measures were ``having some effect.''
   ``The best chance for peace is for him (Saddam) to understand
that all means - all means - necessary ... will be used against
him,'' the president said.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III drove the point home
Wednesday. ``Nobody can ever tell you that sanctions alone can
force Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait. I am personally very
pessimistic that they will.''
   And CIA Director William Webster said, ``Our judgment has been,
and continues to be, that there is no assurance or guarantee that
economic hardhips will compel Saddam to change his policies or
lead to internal unrest that would threaten his regime.''
   The administration's change could be intended to send Saddam the
message that the United States was ruling out all possibilities
except the use of force for settling the dispute.
   Or it could be intended to send that message to the American
people, to prepare them for going to war.
   The change of signal is clear. Its purpose is not.

   OK, kids, it's pizza night. See what the
supermarket has to go. Hold the anchovies.
   It's the coming thing, says the Agriculture Department. And one
of these days the local supermarket may be delivering fresh, hot
pizza directly to the front door.
   ``Supermarkets have been edging into the fresh pizza business
for the past few years,'' says Charlene Price of the department's
Economic Research Service. ``Pizza is now becoming the food of
choice and is closing in on hamburgers as the most popular take-out
food.''
   Price, writing in the agency's National Food Review, said an
estimated 43 percent of the nation's supermarkets now offer fresh
pizza.
   As an example, she said, Bashas' Supermarkets in Arizona offer
hot pizza using fresh crusts pre-baked daily at each store's
bakery. Prices start at $2.99 for a 12-inch hot cheese pizza, made
to order from a fully exposed work station in the deli department.
Orders can be phoned in.
   ``For this type of service to continue to grow, supermarkets
must be able to provide more customer service by offering an option
of eating in as well as installing a phone solely for the pizza
department,'' she said. ``They must also provide pickup or delivery
service.''
   Pizzas just one example of the changing services being offered
by supermarkets.
   More than half of Safeway's stores offer prepared foods such as
lasagna, pastas, barbecued chicken, salads and desserts at deli
counters. Self-service salad, soup and sandwich bars, as well as
yogurt and ice cream machines, are in some stores.
   ``Farmer Jack Supermarkets in Detroit, Mich., introduced
prepared food sections, Yvonne's-To-Go, five years ago,'' Price
said. ``The section offers large selection of freshly prepared
entrees, imported gourmet coffee and tea, ice cream, pastries and
other desserts, all prepared in-store.''
   Also, she said, the store has a sit-down restaurant that serves
up to 20 people. The customers have a choice of salads, soups,
sauces, frozen pasta items, quiches, pates and sausages.
   Raley's in California has expanded its take-out food program in
selected locations to offer complete specialty menus of authentic
ethnic food, Price said. Some stores feature Chinese, while others
go with Mexican.
   ``Sit-down eating areas in supermarkets have been steadily
increasing,'' she said. ``More than two-thirds of the supermarkets
with service delis have some sort of eating area, ranging from a
few chairs and tables to elaborate sit-down restaurants.''
   Most of these eating areas are quite small, however. Less than 1
percent are full-scale restaurants or cafeterias.
   Another trend has been the move by processors to get on the
microwave bandwagon in supermarkets, Price said. The latest
innovations include microwaveable fast foods such as breakfast
sandwiches, hamburgers, cheeseburger and various potato products.
   Goodings Super Markets in Florida has set up microwaveable
fast-food sections in its frozen food departments. Items include
hamburgers, french fries, cheese sticks, popcorn, fish or meat
sandwiches, pizza and chicken snacks - all heated and served in the
store.
   ``Microwaveable hamburgers and cheeseburgers are competing with
fast food chains for the away-from-home food dollar,'' Price said.
   The microwaveable sandwich business posted an estimated $130
million in sales last year, and sales are expected to grow by 20
percent annually over the next couple of years, the researcher
said.
   ``Food service in supermarkets has come a long way, yet it
represents only the beginning,'' she said.
   According to Schotland Business Research Inc., the value of food
prepared specially for microwave heating will grow from $5 billion
in 1988 to $7 billion by 1993.
   ``An estimated 94 percent of homes will contain microwave
ovens,'' Price said. ``The number of microwaveable frozen foods
will grow by 25 percent during the next four years.''
   Despite the growth in supermarket food services, Price said some
problems still are being worked out.
   ``For example, there is a shift to fewer hot foods since the
first phase of ready-to-eat meals because it is difficult to
maintain the quality,'' she said. ``Heat lamps and steam tables
that keep foods hot also tend to dry them out and reheating causes
moisture loss.''
   And although microwave technology is fast and convenient, some
foods do not respond well to it. Pot pies and french fries often
are soggy when heated in a microwave oven.
   Price said designers are also producing packages that allow
foods to brown better and get crisper.
   The new food services and microwaveable products are the hot
items for the 1990s, she said. But industry officials say
traditional foods won't be pushed out of the picture.

<HEAD>Thousands More Reservists Called Up for Gulf Crisis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army called up 13,614 more reservists for
active duty in support of Operation Desert Shield, and it put an
undisclosed number of others on alert.
   The Marine Corps said it called up 84 reservists.
   The call-ups were announced Wednesday, two days after Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney raised to 188,000 the maximum number of
reservists who can be put on active duty at one time for the
Persian Gulf crisis. The previous limit had been 125,000.
   The additional reservists are needed to help load and transport
tons of extra equipment being deployed to Saudi Arabia with about
200,000 reinforcement troops, and to perform a variety of spport
roles once the materiel gets there.
   More than 110,000 reservists from the Army, Navy, Air Force,
Marine Corps and Coast Guard have been ordered to active duty since
late August.
   The Army said the 13,614 members of the National Guard and
Reserve are being called up from 37 states, the District of
Columbia, Puerto Rico and from three U.S. bases in Germany. They
were ordered to report for 90 days of active duty starting
Thursday.
   Among them are specialists in history, law enforcement, medical
service, combat engineering, cargo transport and blood support.
They raise to 87,204 the number of Army National Guard and Reserve
members called to active duty for Desert Shield.
   Of the Marine Corps reservists getting the call, 14 are from a
Newport News, Va., unit. They are to report Monday for salvage duty
with the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force, based at Camp Pendleton,
Calif.
   Seventy-four Marine reservists from various locations were
ordered to report Dec. 15 to the Combat Service Support Detachment
at Kaneohe Bay Marine Corps Air Station, Hawaii.

<HEAD>House Panel Calls for Review of Canadian Crash Probe</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The U.S. government should review Canada's
findings in the crash of a military charter plane that killed 256
Americans, says a congressional panel that probed a possible
terrorist link to the 1985 disaster.
   Canada should turn over its investigative reports on the Gander,
Newfoundland, crash to the FBI while the National Transportation
Safety Board analyzes the cause of the tragedy, Rep. William
Hughes, D-N.J., said Wednesday.
   FBI agents were barred from the crash scene and the NTSB
embraced Canada's findings about the cause without consulting the
chief U.S. investigator who looked into the disaster, according to
testimony before the House Judiciary subcommittee on crime, chaired
by Hughes.
   A Canadian panel ruled that the plane probably went down due to
ice on its wings.
   The FBI should have insisted on playing a role in the probe and
the NTSB was derelict in its duty, Hughes said at the conclusion of
two days of hearings.
   NTSB investigator George Seidlein was sent to Gander and
concluded that the weather conditions simply weren't right for ice
to have formed on the wings in sufficient amounts to cause the
crash. Seidlein testified that he wasn't invited by his superiors
to give his views and didn't volunteer them.
   FBI agents sent to Gander following the crash spent two days in
a motel and left after Canadian investigators assured them there
was no terrorist connection to the crash.
   The Royal Canadian Mounted Police handled the criminal aspects
of the probe, said Nicholas O'Hara, deputy assistant director of
the FBI's criminal investigative division.
   ``I never found your organization in 25 years to be timid,''
Hughes commented. ``I'm surprised you fold your tent after two days
and go home. ... The rumors of terrorism and sabotage were
rampant.''
   The FBI has a high level of cooperation with the RCMP, O'Hara
insisted.
   The families of the victims ``have a right to expect more,''
said Hughes. ``I'm disappointed with the ... FBI. ... No wonder the
families are so angry.''
   Hughes said the subcommittee has been pressing Canada to provide
investigative reports compiled by the RCMP.
   The Canadian embassy says it is still working on the request.
Hughes said he will urge Congress to pursue the matter and that the
FBI and intelligence agencies should review the reports once the
U.S. government gets them.
   The FBI and the State Department told the crime subcommittee
there is no credible evidence the DC-8 jetliner, carrying troops of
the 101st Airborne Division from the Middle East, was sabotaged or
targeted with a terrorist bomb.
   The Canadian government findings have been challenged by other
Canadian investigators, several congressmen and families of the
victims who suspect terrorism as the cause.
   Several eyewitnesses say they saw a bright flame just before the
crash. A terrorist group with ties to Iran claimed responsibility
for the disaster, which occurred amid the Reagan administration's
secret arms sales to Iran.

<HEAD>Don't Have a Meltdown, Man, But `Simpsons' Cooling N-Plant Jokes</HEAD>

   There will be no more three-eyed fish on ``The
Simpsons,'' whose producers say they're cooling their nuclear
industry jokes after touring a real power plant.
   But don't have a meltdown, Simpsons fans.
   The prime-time cartoon show will continue to rib the industry in
its third season next year, but in a more responsible way,
Executive Producer Sam Simon said in an interview this week.
   Simon said the Fox Broadcasting Co. program had been guilty of
``cheap shots.''
   The U.S. Council for Energy Awareness, a nuclear industry group,
told Simon in a February letter that the show ``offended a lot of
people in the energy industry.''
   ``At a time when we should be concerned about where we'll get
enough electricity to fuel our economy later in this decade, you
are confusing and frightening your viewers by portraying nuclear
power plant personnel as bungling idiots,'' the letter said.
   Top ``idiot'' on the council's list was Homer, father of the
Simpson family and an employee of the fictitious Springfield
nuclear plant. Homer seems to care less about safety than about
having enough tartar sauce for his fish sticks.
   In various episodes, Homer gives away the plant's blueprints to
a foreign exchange student, his boss tries to bribe a plant
inspector with a bushel of cash and three-eyed ``Blinky'' is found
swimming near the plant.
   ``I agree with you that in real life Homer Simpson would not be
employed at a nuclear power plant. On the other hand, he probably
wouldn't be employed anywhere,'' Simon said in a Feb. 5 letter to
Carl Goldstein, a vice president of the energy group.
   Simon suggested that he and other Fox executives tour a real
nuclear power plant.
   In April, the group converged on the San Onofre plant in San
Clemente, Calif., 40 miles south of Fox's Los Angeles offices.
   ``We don't have any Homers at our nuclear plant,'' said David
Barron, a spokesman for San Onofre's owner, Southern California
Edison, who accompanied the producers and writers.
   Simon said the tour showed that ``The Simpsons'' had been right
- and wrong - about nuclear power.
   Although they did little initial research, he said the
``Simpsons'' creators seemed to accurately represent worker
conditions - the cafeterias, lunch pails and radiation warning
signs. The writers placed Homer in a ``sector'' to illustrate an
impersonal bureaucracy, then discovered some plants actually used
that term.
   But Simon also said the tour also ``changed a lot of people's
minds. I think the facts are pretty powerful that it's a clean and
safe and important source of energy. While some of the shows were
in the works before, we really backed off that as a source of
comedy. No more three-eyed fish.''
   But the show will still feature jokes about what evil
Springfield nuclear plant owner Montgomery Burns terms his
``nuclear, nuclear family.''
   For example, plans call for Homer to avert a nuclear meltdown.
   ``He's kind of asleep at the wheel and wakes up when there's an
alarm, and doesn't know which button to press, so he goes
eeney-meeney-miney-mo and hits a button and does avert a
meltdown,'' Simon said. ``He becomes a hero and feels guilty about
it. It's not a politically charged episode.''
   And Homer is to begin a dinner grace with this: ``Thank you for
nuclear power, which has yet to cause a single fatality ... at
least in this country.''
   The U.S. nuclear power industry has been sensitive about its
image since the Three Mile Isand accident in 1979 that led to a $1
billion cleanup. And in 1987, Pennsylvania's Peach Bottom plant was
shut down for a time and 33 workers fined on charges of ``sleeping
and-or inattention to duty.''
   Asked if she watched ``The Simpsons,'' Three Mile Island
spokeswoman Mary Wells jokingly told a reporter, ``Goodbye!'' But
she relented, and confessed she finds the show funny.
   Simon said the producers had a practical reason for placing
Homer at a power plant.
   ``It was really just for the joke that this boob had a position
where he could possibly make a mistake and destroy the world,'' he
said.

<HEAD>California Looking For Businesses That Want Felons</HEAD>

   California is looking for businesses
willing to hire criminals, and only criminals, by the thousands.
   The new gang of factory workers won't have to commute. In fact,
they'll be in big trouble if they try. And they won't be organizing
unions, guzzling beer after work or chasing co-workers of the
opposite sex.
   The jobs will be blue collar, literally -prison blue.
   Pressed by a rising prison population and tight budget,
California voters decided to encourage businesses to set up shop
inside prisons and put inmates to work so they can contribute to
their upkeep and gain valuable job skills.
   If successful, it would be the largest such program in the
nation.
   Pay will be similar to what prisoners might make on the outside,
but some of their earnings will be deducted to help defray the $2
billion annual cost of feeding and housing California's 98,000
state prisoners.
   ``Why should law-abiding citizens have to work and pay taxes to
support a free ride for convicted criminals?'' said Gov. George
Deukmejian, who sponsored the ballot measure approved Nov. 6.
   The state prison population has more than quadrupled during
Deukmejian's two terms in office.
   About 8,000 adults in state prison now make only minimal wages
producing goods such as furniture and license plates. The products
can be sold only to government agencies in order to limit
competition with private industry.
   A separate program employs about 100 juveniles in private
businesses at California youth prisons.
   Organizers of the new program for adult inmates hope to create
7,000 jobs with operations like recycling or clothing manufacture.
Nationwide, about 1,500 prisoners work for private businesses,
according to the U.S. Justice Department.
   Craig Brown, undersecretary of the state Youth and Adult
Correctional Agency, said inmates will scramble for the new ``real
world jobs'' to make money and gain skills.
   ``Working in the prison kitchen probably doesn't provide you too
much you can use on the outside,'' he said.
   The California Manufacturers Association supports the program
but wants to ensure it does not create unfair competition with the
private sector, said president Bill Campbell.
   ``It's an exciting, innovative program and the manufacturing
community will look upon it very favorably,'' he said.
   Unions oppose the measure, arguing it will ``turn back the clock
of history to chain gang memories with controlled labor being
exploited to the detriment of free labor,'' said John Henning of
the California Labor Federation.
   State officials said they will try to limit any competition by
targeting emerging and labor-intensive industries. In a further
safeguard, companies are barred from using prison labor to replace
striking workers.
   Brown said a task force setting up the program hopes to bring
the first businesses into the men's and women's prisons sometime
next year.
   State analysts said they don't know how much the program will
save because there are too many variables, but savings will come
from diverting workers' pay to cover room and board, and from early
releases earned with work credits.
   Officials also hope the job skills learned will reduce the
number of inmates who return to prison.
   But the state also will lose some money by giving employers tax
credits.
   Task force member Kathy Kinser of the state Corrections
Department said the program requires that inmates get paid at
levels comparable to those on the outside.
   Proposed regulations call for 20 percent of inmates' net wages
to go to room and board; up to 20 percent for restitution to crime
victims, and up to 15 percent to mandatory savings. Paychecks would
be subject to the usual tax withholdings and other deductions,
including family support.
   The program for putting imprisoned juveniles to work in private
enterprise has employed 1,000 youths in five years. The 100 people
in the program handle overflow calls for Trans World Airlines
flight reservations, assemble electronics for exercise machines,
microfilm documents and form sheet metal for ducts.

<HEAD>Survey Shows Economy Slowing in All U.S. Regions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Federal Reserve survey of the nation's
economic pulse finds business conditions either declining or
growing weakly in every region of the country as November came to
an end.
   The ``beige book'' survey released Wednesday showed retail sales
down in virtually all 12 of the central bank's districts.
Manufacturing conditions weakened in most districts, and most
districts also reported continued sluggishness in construction.
   Demand for business loans softened in many areas at the same
time banks were tightening their standards for making loans.
   On balance, business conditions ``display a weaker pattern''
than a similar survey conducted in mid-October that found either
slow growth or an actual decline in economic activity in the Fed
districts.
   In one of the few bright spots, ``Agriculture is reported to
have been doing very well,'' a summary of the survey said. ``Crop
yields have been good and livestock prices have been high.''
   The report was the latest piece of evidence that the economy has
weakened in recent months to the point that many economists say it
now is in a recession.
   Manufacturers, in particular, expressed concern about business
prospects for the coming months, the survey found.
   ``The majority of manufacturers contacted in the Boston district
expect a national recession lasting two to four quarters,'' the
report said. ``Business leaders contacted in the San Francisco
district expect continued deterioration in the national economy.''
   Automobile sales were reported to have weakened, particularly in
the Cleveland, Chicago and St. Louis districts. Dallas was an
exception.
   The pessimism, however, was not universal.
   Philadelphia manufacturers expect modest improvements over the
next six months and ``manufacturers in the Richmond district were
less pessimistic about prospects than they had been a month ago,''
the report said.
   And soft domestic demand was partially offset by strong export
orders.
   Despite the weakness, inventories were described as ``under
control.'' An excessive increase in inventories could mean job
layoffs as industries cut production in an attempt to reduce
backlogs.
   Nevertheless, ``several districts report a decline in consumer
and business confidence and many refer to expectations of continued
diminution in economic activity,'' the survey found.
   ``Retail sales apparently have weakened in almost all the
districts,'' the report said. ``Most districts report that
retailers were pessimistic about sales prospects for the Christmas
season as well as for 1991.''
   Most districts also reported continued sluggishness in
construction activity.
   ``Residential construction continued to be weak, with several
districts citing a glut of houses for resale,'' the report said.
``Non-residential construction is also reported to be generally
weak.''
   ``However, there are bright spots,'' it continued. ``New York
reports a recent pickup in office leasing activity in downtown
Manhattan. Chicago reports that construction slowdowns are not
universal and that development continues in communities outside
major metropolitan areas ... Minneapolis reports a recent rebound
in construction activity.''
   But the report said activity in the financial sector generally
was slower.
   ``Several districts report a decline in consumer and business
loan demand,'' it said. ``Almost all districts also report some
tightening by banks of business loan terms, particularly for
construction and land development.''
   None of the districts reported any major problems with
inflation, although reports of price increases varied. In fact, the
strong agricultural production contributed to lower crop prices,
although this adversely affected farmer incomes in some areas.
   The report was written at the Federal Reserve Bank of
Minneapolis based on information collected before Nov. 26. The
report was prepared for the Dec. 17 meeting of the Federal Open
Market Committee, the Fed arm responsible for setting monetary
policy.

   President Hussain Muhammad Ershad, who
has promised to resign after widespread protests against his
government, dissolved Parliament on Thursday after lifting a state
of emergency.
   State-run radio announced the dissolution of Parliament but gave
no reason. Parliament had been expected to remain in session until
Saturday to ratify Ershad's successor, who would govern in a
caretaker capacity until new elections.
   Constitutional experts and well-placed opposition sources said
Ershad would swear in his own successor.
   They said this method of transition of power was chosen because
it appeared Parliament would not be able to summon a majority to
endorse the caretaker leader, Supreme Court Chief Justice
Shahabuddin Ahmed.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anomnymity, said the
swearing-in might take place later Thursday.
   Two-thirds of Parliament's members belong to Ershad's Jatiya
Party. Many have been reluctant to appear in public for fear of
being attacked by anti-Ershad activists.
   Some Jatiya Party offices and officials' residences around the
country have been stoned or ransacked in the past week. The
dissolved Parliament was seated in 1986 elections, called
fraudulent by observers, that Ershad also won.
   Ershad lifted the state of emergency late Wednesday, eight days
after he imposed it because of increasingly violent demonstrations
for his removal.
   But the street protests continued, despite the deployment of
army troops and a curfew that was supposed to keep people indoors.
   On Tuesday night, Ershad bowed to the groundswell of opposition
and said he would step down as soon as a temporary successor was
chosen.
   Opposition leaders Sheik Hasina and Khaleda Zia, agreed
Wednesday night on Shahabuddin, a career lawyer and judge with a
reputation as a political independent. The two women led the
seven-week campaign to oust Ershad, a former army general who took
power in a bloodless 1982 coup.
   Ershad's announcement that he would resign ended an
often-violent campaign for his ouster. The opposition claims at
least 100 people were killed by security forces since the
emergency. The government says only six people died.
   Ershad, who only a few weeks ago had confidently predicted he
would be re-elected in the spring, caved in to the opposition's
demands with an abruptness that stunned the country.
   Anti-Ershad demonstrations had become routine in recent years,
but the latest round were marked by unprecedented unity and
spontaneity.
   As the protests snowballed, eight years of rumors and discontent
over what was perceived as Ershad's arrogance and tolerance of
corruption burst out of private drawing rooms into the streets.
   The president's downfall was hastened by a wave of resignations
in support of the opposition. Hundreds of doctors, professors,
civil servants, merchant seamen and at least 19 Parliament members
of his Jatiya Party resigned from their jobs in protest against
Ershad.
   On Wednesday, a student leader was killed and two other people
were injured by security guards when they attempted to storm the
home of a high-ranking government official in a northern town.
   Several thousand people assembled at Dhaka airport demanding
that airport authorities stop Ershad or other government officials
if they tried to flee the country.
   But there was no indication that any government official was
planning to leave. Ershad spent Wednesday in his home and in an
office deep in the well-guarded military cantonment in Dhaka and
canceled all appointments.
   A senior member of his Cabinet, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Ershad was still in charge of the government. Other
sources said the military was still taking orders from Ershad.
   Mrs. Zia and Hasina appealed to their followers for calm. They
said the effort to end Ershad's rule was not yet over, and they
warned the president of ``the people's wrath'' if he reneged on his
promise to resign.
   Addressing 50,000 cheering and chanting followers at a rally,
Hasina said: ``Although Ershad announced that he had resigned, in
fact he is still in power.''
   Mrs. Zia echoed those concerns at another gathering, accusing
Ershad of ``conspiring to stay in power.''
   ``Let there be no doubt that people will fight until they have
achieved the victory and ousted the autocratic government,'' she
said.
   On Wednesday, state-run media let Hasina and Mrs. Zia address
the people for the first time.
   The two women have been agitating for Ershad's ouster since he
took power, but their political differences thwarted any lasting
campaign.
   Then, in October, the opposition was galvanized by Ershad's
announcement that he would be a candidate in June presidential
elections.
   Mrs. Zia and Hasina have said they have buried their
differences, but they still have not spelled out their stands on
constitutional changes or on other domestic or foreign issues.
   Hasina is the daughter of Sheik Mujibur Rahman, Bangladesh's
first president. Mrs. Zia is the widow of another former president,
Ziaur Rehman. Both men were assassinated.
   Ershad is the country's ninth president since it gained
independence from Pakistan in 1971. Like all of his predecessors,
he was installed by military action.

<HEAD>House Democrats Dump Two Veteran Committee Chairmen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Democrats are tossing out two veteran
committee chairmen in a move that reflects restlessness over an
embarrassing year on Capitol Hill and a trying election season for
incumbents.
   Wednesday's votes that ousted Rep. Glenn Anderson of California
as chairman of the Public Works and Transportation Committee and
Rep. Frank Annunio of Illinois from the Committee on House
Administration were seen as a warning to the chamber's leaders to
improve performance and efficiency.
   ``Neither of them saw it coming. It was a tidal wave,'' said
Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio.
   ``The House is in a position where some shaking up is a
necessary thing to do,'' said Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan. ``It's not
a mutiny. But the status quo cannot prevail. There's a healthy
questioning going on right now and a few chairmen are getting the
boot because of it.''
   In addition to the ousters of Anderson and Annunzio, several
committee chairmen racked up worrisome levels of opposition in
secret-ballot votes of confidence behind the closed doors of the
caucus.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez of Texas, chairman of the Banking
Committee, kept his position on a vote of 163-89.
   Rep. Morris Udall of Arizona, the Interior Committee chairman,
drew 47 opposition votes; North Carolina Rep. Walter Jones of the
Merchant Marine Committee was opposed by 46 members; and three
chairmen drew 34 ``no'' votes each: Energy and Commerce Chairman
John Dingell of Michigan; Veterans Affairs Chairman Sonny
Montgomery of Mississippi; and Appropriations Chairman Jamie
Whitten of Mississippi.
   Several lawmakers described the shakeups as aftershocks from
last month's elections, and others said they were an effort to weed
out figures who do not convey the vigorous, clean image the party
wants.
   ``Throughout 1990 the House was given a black eye because of the
protracted budget mess,'' said Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.
``Americans were asking, Why can't you get your work done? This is
an expression of that discontent. It's laying down the law that
we're not going to sit by and let it happen next year.''
   Democrats sent their signal not directly to the leadership,
which was all re-elected, but by knocking off what were deemed the
weakest of their committee chairmen.
   The 77-year-old Anderson, who was the subject of complaints of
ineffectiveness and passivity, was replaced by the second-ranking
Democrat on Public Works and Transportation, Rep. Robert Roe of New
Jersey.
   ``What the committee was looking for was stronger policy
positions and better coordination,'' Roe said after he edged the
No. 3 committee Democrat, Norman Mineta of California, 121-107, for
the chairmanship.
   ``This is the basic committee that provides the infrastructure
for the nation - roads, bridges, highways, airports. It really
determines the direction, what the priorities will be in rebuilding
America,'' Roe said.
   Annunzio, 75, who was linked to the savings-and-loan scandal
during a difficult re-election campaign in his Chicago, also was
described by colleagues as ineffective and too willing to let an
abrasive aide run the committee for him.
   He was replaced by Rep. Charles Rose of North Carolina, the
Administration Committee's No. 3 member. Rose prevailed over
second-ranking Joseph Gaydos of Pennsylvania on a 158-64 vote.
   The caucus also gave the Committee on Science, Space and
Technology, which had been chaired by Roe, to Rep. George Brown of
California, next in the line of seniority on the panel.
   In other changes, Rep. William D. Ford, D-Mich., gave up his
chairmanship of the Post Office and Civil Service Committee to
replace the retiring Augustus F. Hawkins of California as chairman
of the Education and Labor Committee. Rep. William Clay, D-Mo.,
moves up to Ford's old job.

   Chrysler Corp. is rejecting a consumer
advocacy organization's request to recall 500,000 cars and minivans
with a newly designed automatic transmission, insisting its flaws
have been worked out.
   ``We addressed those problems quickly and believe the
transmission is now fully competitive from reliability and
durability standpoints and ahead of the competition in many other
areas,'' Chrysler spokesman Tony Cervone said.
   But the Center for Auto Safety says the Ultradrive transmission,
introduced in 1989 models, is still plagued by sticking between
gears, clutch burnout, computer controller failure and internal
damage.
   The nation's third-largest automaker introduced the Ultradrive
four-speed transmission in late 1988.

Congressional Black Caucus for the 102nd Congress.
   He will succeed Rep. Ronald V. Dellums, D-Calif.

this year, is planning 27 flights in the next three years.
   The schedule announced Wednesday includes seven shuttle launches
in 1991, eight in 1992 and 12 in 1993. The shuttle Endeavour, a
replacement for the destroyed Challenger, will join the fleet in
1992 and its first mission will be to reboost a stranded satellite.
   In the three-year period, NASA also plans to launch 13 rockets.
Their payloads include three major scientific probes - the Extreme
Ultraviolet Explorer and Geotail on Delta 2 rockets, and the Mars
Observer on the larger Titan III.
   For the first time, there are no secret Defense Department
launches on the schedule. But unclassified military cargoes are
slated for three flights, including the first one next year.

   The dollar regained strength against the yen
Thursday, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange advanced
moderately.
   The yen closed at 134.05 yen, up 0.63 yen from Wednesday's close
of 133.42 yen. After opening at 133.90 yen, the currency ranged
between 133.70 yen and 134.17 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues rose 359.38
points, or 1.62 percent, closing at 22,553.10. The index had gained
331.11 points on Wednesday.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds slipped to 86.70, down from Wednesday's
close of 87.22. Their yield edged up to 7.340 percent from 7.225
percent.
   Currency traders said traders first bought the dollar following
its advance Wednesday in New York, boosted by Secretary of State
James A. Baker III's remark demanding that Iraq withdraw from
Kuwait.
   ``There was a little movement on the exchange market following a
round of dollar-selling on profit-taking,'' said a dealer with
Sanwa Bank, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Baker told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the Bush
administration would strike ``suddenly, massively and decsively''
if military force is used to try to drive Iraq from Kuwait.
   The dollar has gained recently after reports of possible
hostilities in the Middle East. The U.S. currency is seen as a safe
haven in times of international tension.
   The possibility of war in the Persian Gulf tends to weaken the
yen because Japan imports virtually all of its oil, with about 70
percent of the imports coming from the Middle East.
   On the stock exchange, the Nikkei index continued to rise in a
favorable reaction to signs of improvement in the Middle East
following a State Department announcement that Iraq had agreed to
hold talks with President Bush, securities dealers said.

   The two women who forced a change of
government this week have one thing in common: They were thrust
into politics by assassinations that deprived them of the men who
had the most influence on their lives.
   Both men were presidents of Bangladesh.
   Apart from that, Sheik Hasina and Khaleda Zia share little
except a dogged determination to oust President Hussain Muhammad
Ershad, the ninth president in 19 years and like all his
predecessors, installed by military might.
   Their personal and political rivalry had long been a stumbling
block in their shared goal of ousting Ershad.
   Mrs. Zia, asked once why she couldn't patch up her differences
with Hasina, said frostily: ``Two days ago, I invited her to tea.
She didn't come.''
   Hasina and Mrs. Zia had usually boycotted national elections for
the presidency and Parliament.
   But finally, they were forced to face the fast-approaching
reality: Ershad planned to seek election in June for another 5-year
term - and might win unless they mounted a joint campaign.
   Both women had long vowed not to run against him, charging that
he would would rig the elections to ensure his own victory.
Changing their minds would have meant backing down on what they had
called a matter of principle.
   Neither was ready to run unless the other did. And even if they
both ran, Ershad might have emerged the victor in a three-way
contest.
   Since the one thing they could agree on was getting rid of
Ershad, they concentrated on that as they never had before. Their
street rallies and nationwide strikes took on a life of their own,
drawing in people who previously had been content to sit at home
and gripe about Ershad without taking public action.
   After seven weeks of strikes and demonstrations, Ershad said
Tuesday that he would resign as soon as his replacement was chosen.
   The question of who will eventually emerge as Bangladesh's top
leader - Hasina or Mrs. Zia or a political compromise or dark-horse
candidate - is unanswered. So is the matter of what political
course Hasina and Mrs. Zia will pursue while they hold the
momentum.
   Hasina, 43, presides over the Awami League and seven allied
parties which are slightly left-of-center.
   Mrs. Zia, 46, is the leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party
which is grouped with six other centrist parties.
   Hasina inherited the Awami League leadership after her father,
Bangladesh's first president, Sheik Mujibur Rahman, was
assassinated in a military coup in 1975.
   Hasina was in Germany at the time. Except for a sister who also
was abroad, Hasina's entire family was wiped out in the coup. Her
father, mother, three brothers, two sisters-in-law, two uncles and
a cousin were all slain by the army officers who stormed into the
family home.
   Hasina's office is her father's library, just across the hall
from the stairs where his bloodstains have been preserved and fresh
flowers are placed daily.
   Mrs. Zia's husband, President Ziaur Rahman, was an army general
who took power in a 1977 coup and was assassinated four years
later.
   Despite their common personal tragedies, Hasina never warmed to
Mrs. Zia, a charismatic woman who strikes the sort of empathy with
crowds that Hasina has never achieved.
   Hasina harbors suspicions that Gen. Zia might have had a role in
the coup that killed her father, according to her closest
associates.
   Besides that, the two women have fundamental political
differences. Hasina prefers a parliamentary system of government
where power goes to the party that wins the most seats and whose
leader automatically becomes prime minister.
   Mrs. Zia favors the presidential system, wheretthe voters elect
an individual leader.
   Hasina's main strength is that her Awami League is believed to
have a larger and better-organized grass roots following than Mrs.
Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party.
   But Mrs. Zia inspires the crowds by her mere presence. She
exudes warmth and glamor, with discreet make-up and jewels and
silken saris.
   Hasina, with her wire-rimmed spectacles and practical cotton
saris, appears like a lecturer facing a classroom of dutiful
students. The dry wit she displays in small gatherings seldom comes
across in public.
   Both were brought into politics by supporters of their
assassinated menfolk.
   After her father was killed, Hasina spent six years in
self-exile in India where her husband, nuclear scientist Wazed Ali
Miah, was studying.
   She was elected head of the Awami League before she ever
returned to Bangladesh, although she says she had been tutored in
politics since childhood.
   Mrs. Zia was pressured to enter politics by her late husband's
followers, who were looking for someone to unite his party.
   But both women evolved into dominant leaders in their own right.
   ``She gets her own way when the question of party decision
comes,'' said a senior leader of Mrs. Zia's party, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Hasina has a similar reputation within her party, where she is
periodically at odds with the older leaders. She surrounds herself
with young people who support her in the internal party fights
against the senior leaders.

<HEAD>Karpov Beats Kasparov in Game 17</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Reigning champion Garry Kasparov and
challenger Anatoly Karpov resume their duel for the world chess
title this weekend, Karpov having won game 17 and again brought the
score to a tie.
   ``I feel very confident now,'' Karpov said Wednesday after
winning on the 40th move. ``It was quite clear that he was not in
good shape.''
   The two Soviet grandmasters are now tied 8.5 points each with
the next game scheduled for Saturday. A win counts for a point, a
tie for a half-point.
   Kasparov had gone ahead Tuesday when he won the marathon 16th
game after 102 moves played over four days. But Karpov, with the
white pieces on Wednesday, evened the match.
   The first player to gain 12.5 points wins the championship and
$1.7 million of a $3 million purse. In the event of a tie, Kasparov
retains the title. The first 12 games were played in New York.
   After forcing Kasparov's resignation Wednesday, Karpov said,
``It was a very complicated game, but I felt I always had the
advantage.''
   The game began with a familiar scenario. As the two previous
games in Lyon with Karpov playing white, the opening was a Grunfeld
with an exchange variation as Kasparov castled on the eighth move.
But Karpov moved his knight into deeper territory on the 10th move.
   That caused Kasparov almost 30 minutes of reflection before
countering with a pawn exchange, then bringing a knight forward.
   Each player is allowed 2{ hours for his first 40 moves.
   Karpov wasted his time advantage on the 25th move when he had to
decide how to capture a black knight. He finally did so with a
bishop.
   At that point, both players had less than 30 minutes for 15
moves.
   The game turned in Karpov's favor when he advanced a queen and
established a rook deep in black territory.
   Kasparov tried to get out of trouble, but Karpov kept advancing.
Karpov even moved a pawn to the seventh rank, blocking the black
queen and attacking a rook.
   Kasparov gave up two moves later.

   Accept a collect call from a New York state
inmate and you'll be helping battle AIDS, give prisoners cable TV
and make conjugal visits more comfortable.
   Like many state prison systems, New York's keeps a share of
telephone company profits from inmate calls - which are all collect
because there are no pay phones behind bars.
   ``We've provided them with a captive audience,'' Amy Colodny,
spokeswoman for the New York prison system, said of the rationale
for collecting a portion of phone company profits.
   In New York, the state gets 16 percent of the phone company's
profits on long distance calls made by inmates. For local calls,
which are also collect, the state receives between 6 percent and 12
percent of the profits.
   This year, the state's share will be about $8.5 million,
officials said.
   Thirty-four state prisons systems and the federal prison system
contract with phone companies for long-distance service. Of those,
32 states receive a portion of the profits, ranging from 5 percent
in West Virginia to 50 percent in Arizona, according a survey by
the publication Corrections Compendium.
   Several states put the money toward inmate programs. In Alabama,
prison officials said part of the money goes toward legal
materials. In Indiana and New Hampshire, the money pays for inmate
recreation, and in Michigan it pays for vocational education.
Pennsylvania receives about $100,000 per month through the program
and spends the money on inmate activities.
   Inmates in most New York state prisons can use the phones
between 8 a.m. and 11 p.m., whenever they're not participating in a
prison program.
   The largest portion of the money, $2.8 million, is spent on the
AIDS drug AZT, and $1.5 million is spent on AIDS training for staff
and inmates.
   Prison officials estimate that up to 8,000 of New York's 52,000
inmates are infected with the AIDS virus and about 800 have AIDS.
   Another $1.5 million is spent on such things as job services,
reception centers for visitors and furniture for ``family reunion''
trailers, where conjugal visits take place.
   Approximately $76,000 is spent on cable television. About half
of the state's prisons have cable.
   An additional $650,000 provides bus trips to prisons for
inmates' relatives, and nearly $500,000 is for a program to help
inmates be better mothers and fathers when they get out.

   A volcano at the bottom of the Pacific that
is destined to be the next Hawaiian island is going high-tech with
a $4 million network of cameras and seismic sensors to document its
deep-sea rumblings.
   ``We would love to catch an eruption,'' Fred K. Duennebier, a
professor of geology and geophysics at the University of Hawaii,
said Wednesday of the Hawaiian Undersea Geo-Observatory.
   The observatory will be installed on Loihi seamount, an
underwater volcano 22 miles southeast of the island of Hawaii.
Loihi rises about 11,200 feet above the ocean floor, but its
cratered summit is still 3,300 feet beneath the waves.
   ``It will be the next Hawaiian island in about 50,000 years or
so,'' Duennebier said at a meeting the American Geophysical Union.
``I wouldn't buy real estate yet.''
   The observatory, which scientists hope to have in operation
within two years, will be a network of 20 or more cameras and
instruments draped across Loihi's summit and slopes.
   HUGO will be connected to the Big Island by a power cable that
will also carry data from the observatory to scientists on shore.
   A ship will lay a network of electro-optical cable and outlet
boxes, then remote-controlled submarines and manned submersible
vehicles will plug in cameras, microphones, seismometers and heat
and chemical sensors.
   It will work for at least 10 years unless it is buried by lava
flows or landslides, Duennebier said.
   Scientists are sure Loihi is active but haven't actually
observed an eruption. Intense earthquake activity suggests
eruptions happened in 1986, 1988 and early this year, Duennebier
said.
   The Hawaiian Islands were created by a ``hot spot,'' a plume of
molten rock that rises from deep inside the Earth. Loihi is now
over the hot spot, which also has branches feeding Hawaii's active
Kilauea and Mauna Loa volcanos.
   Roughly 60 percent to 80 percent of the world's volcanos are on
the sea floor.
   ``We have no idea how these volcanos are built up from the ocean
floor,'' Duennebier said. ``We don't know how the lava actually
makes it to the top of the volcano.''

<HEAD>CNN Gives Up Fight to Keep Noriega Tape Transcripts Private</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CNN said it is giving up the fight to prevent the
release of court transcripts of its Manuel Noriega prison tapes.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler, ruling in favor of four
news organizations that demanded access to the transcripts, said
Tuesday they would be released today unless CNN appealed. On
Wednesday, CNN said it would not do so.
   ``CNN's main concern in opposing unsealing of the transcripts
has been to protect the integrity of agreements with sources,'' CNN
spokesman Steve Haworth said.
   But after reviewing the transcripts, network officials decided
there was little danger of compromising those sources, he said.
   CNN has televised some of seven tape recordings of Noriega's
jailhouse conversations with his legal team and had argued that the
recordings of the telephone calls, and therefore the transcripts of
them, were its property.
   Sanford Bohrer, the attorney for the news organizations that
asked for the transcripts, applauded CNN's decision to drop the
fight.
   ``I could never understand how CNN could claim to own
conversations that were taped by the United States government, of
an inmate in a federal prison,'' he said.
   Noriega is awaiting trial on charges he took $4.6 million in
payoffs to allow safe shipment of cocaine through Panama to the
United States.
   The organizations seeking the transcripts were The Miami Herald,
the Associated Press, Post-Newsweek station WPLG-TV of Miami and
Gannett Co. and its USA Today. They argued that the public has a
right to examine the content of the tapes, which were at the center
of a freedom-of-the-press dispute.
   The controversy began last month when CNN aired a series of
telecasts based on the recordings, which it said were provided by
an anonymous source.
   Hoeveler ordered the telecasts stopped while he determined
whether the action threatened Noriega's right to a fair trial. CNN
opposed the move as an unconstitutional prior restraint on the
press, but the Supreme Court refused to intervene.
   Hoeveler eventually ruled that the tapes didn't jeopardize the
case and could be aired.
   CNN hasn't said where it got the tapes, but Noriega's attorneys
have claimed they were released to the government of Panama by the
State Department or the Drug Enforcement Administration, and that
Panama gave them to CNN.

<HEAD>Attack on Supporters Of Priest Dims Hope of Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - After gunmen attacked one of his
rallies, the populist priest who is leading the race for president
tearfully urged supporters not to fear casting ballots in the Dec.
16 election.
   The Rev. Jean Bertrand Aristide blamed the Wednesday night
attack, in which five people were reported killed and 54 wounded,
on the Tonton Macoutes, the private militia that enforced the
brutal 29-year Duvaler family rule.
   The violence occurred just as a rally by about 10,000 people
near Port-au-Prince was breaking up and appeared intended to
intimidate Aristide supporters into staying away from the polls.
   It came as Haitians were feeling optimistic they could at last
have democratic elections, the first in the 186-year-old history of
this former French colony.
   ``Take heart, dry your tears, hold one another's hands,''
Aristide said in a tearful interview with Radio Antilles. ``We are
going to continue walking together because on the 16th of December,
whether they like it or not, the Macoutes will disappear from
Haiti.''
   A November 1987 attempt at elections was aborted after thugs
backed by the army killed 34 voters at the polls.
   The government promised a probe, but similar undertakings have
failed to bring arrests or charges in earlier violence.
   ``All necessary steps have been taken, and an investigation has
been opened,'' said Minister of Interior Joseph Maxi.
   The violence broke out in the wealthy suburb of Petionville,
about 7 miles from the capital, a half hour after Aristide had
left.
   The 37-year-old priest, the target of three assassination
attempts in the past, has been hailed as a ``prophet'' by many. He
has a huge following among the country's poor, the majority in this
Caribbean nation of 6 million people where violence and
intimidation have traditionally pervaded politics.
   As Aristide supporters were dispersing, the area was hit with a
10-minute blackout that was followed by a loud explosion and then
gunfire. Witnesses said they saw men in a jeep drive up moments
before the blackout.
   ``It happened during the blackout. There was a big boom. We ran,
and while we were running there was shooting. The lights went on
after,'' said one witness, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Hundreds of people ran screaming down the streets after the
explosion rocked the suburb. Scores of people fell to the ground.
It was unknown what caused the blast.
   Witnesses and Radio Metropole said five people died and 54 were
wounded.
   Aristide said the incident could have been prevented if
authorities had arrested Roger Lafontant, the Tonton Macoutes chief
who returned from exile to run for president but was disqualified
the race.
   The Tonton Macoutes were formed under the late dictator ``Papa
Doc'' Francois Duvalier in 1957. The family's rule ended in 1986
when his son, ``Baby Doc,'' Jean Claude Duvalier was forced into
exile in France.
   The country has been rocked by violence since Duvalier's fall
and the interim government of President Ertha Pascal Trouillot,
appointed in March, is the fifth since his fall.
   Reinhardt Helmke, a United Nations representative, said he
didn't think elections would be canceled as a result of the
Wednesday attack.
   ``At this stage, the electoral process is not compromised,'' he
said. ``This is the type of thing that everybody was expecting
would happen at some point.''
   More than 400 international observers from the United Nations
and the Organization of American States are to monitor the
elections. About 200 of them are already in Haiti.

<HEAD>Study: Doctors Who Profit on X-Rays Use Them More</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The suspicion that profits influence the way
doctors treat patients got some support today from a study showing
that those who make money on X-rays take four times as many of
them, researchers say.
   The study, based on a review of insurance records, compared
doctors who owned their own office X-ray and ultrasound machines
with those who send their patients to other specialists for X-rays.
Doctors make a profit on each image they take on their own
equipment but make nothing when they send patients to other
experts.
   The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine,
found that those who owned their own machines took four times as
many X-rays and ultrasound scans for such routine conditions as
colds and backaches.
   It also found that doctors who owned their own equipment charged
considerably more for them than did outside radiologists.
   Although the study could not determine precisely why these
doctors did more X-rays, ``one has to wonder whether it's an issue
of having these machines and realizing that incomes can be
increased by their utilization,'' said Dr. Bruce J. Hillman, who
directed the study at the University of Arizona.
   Ethical standards require that doctors put patients' health
ahead of their own financial interests.
   E. Haavi Morreim, a philosopher at the University of Tennessee
College of Medicine, said there may be other explanations for the
higher X-ray use ``aside from the obvious possibility that frankly
there is money to be made in them there hills.''
   ``There is the simple fact that when something is available,
it's easy to use it often,'' she said. ``When you have a hammer,
everything looks like a nail.''
   Physicians who own X-ray machines were critical of the study and
its implications. Dr. James Weber, a family practitioner in
Jacksonville, Ark., said doctors who do more X-rays may be
practicing better medicine.
   ``The assumption is inferred that these tests are ordered to
benefit the physician rather than the patient,'' he said. ``I can
tell you that wherever you go in the country, that may be true of
less than 1 percent of practicing physicians. The vast majority of
physicians have their patients' interests at heart.''
   Dr. J. Harold Morris, an internist in Kansas City, said doctors
who buy this equipment may take more X-rays because they fear
malpractice or simply because they are, by training, more inclined
to seek test results.
   The study was based on computerized records of 65,517 doctor
visits by privately insured patients who worked for several
companies, mostly in the Midwest.
   The researchers compared the number of X-rays and ultrasound
scans used by doctors who treated patients for stuffy noses,
pregnancy, low back pain and, for men, difficulty urinating.
   Medstate Systems, the company that provided the computerized
records, estimates that working Americans spend $290 million a year
on X-ray and ultrasound scans for these four conditions.

<TEXT>
   Stanislaw Tyminski, an unknown emigre
businessman who has not lived in Poland for the past 21 years,
became a serious contender for the nation's presidency with hardly
a question raised.
   When journalists finally started to take a hard look at
Tyminski's past, he called them ``wolves'' and benefited from a
wave of voter sympathy.
   What started as a cautious first foray into fair election
coverage has ended in a virtual free-for-all as the final round of
elections between Tyminski and Solidarity leader Lech Walesa draws
to a close Sunday.
   Almost daily, newspapers and television unleash a torrent of
disturbing news about Tyminski. But truth has been mixed with rumor
and supposition. Some reporters, frustrated by Tyminski's evasive
answers, have become so partisan that they boo and hiss him at news
conferences.
   In a country in which Communist authorities manipulated the news
media for decades, people became accustomed to believing that the
opposite of what they were reading must be true.
   As a result, some have ignored the alarms being raised in the
independent but factional press about the vague man with the
mysterious past who could assume the nation's highest office.
   Lost in the fury were late-to-surface facts: that Tyminski has
advocated arming Poland with nuclear weapons, that he is connected
with long-time Communist operatives, that he claims a life-changing
spiritual experience in the Peruvian jungle, that he is not the
well-known magnate he claims to be.
   ``We have somebody coming from nowhere, and no reporter checks
who he is,'' says Andrzej Szczypiorski, a senator and
internationally acclaimed writer. ``Now all the fire is aimed at
this puppet, because the country is in danger.''
   The Communists once tried a similar all-out character assault
against Walesa, Szczypiorski recalled. ``You know what effect that
had: Walesa's stature only grew.''
   Until the week before the Nov. 25 first round of voting, the
Polish press was preoccupied with the bitter contest between Walesa
and his former adviser, Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki.
   Back then, the self-proclaimed millionaire from abroad was an
oddity, covered dutifully but uncritically along with other
lesser-known candidates.
   That changed when Tyminski, who promises speedy prosperity,
charged Mazowiecki with economic treason and showed up a shocking
No. 2 in an opinion poll. He finished second in the election,
eliminating the prime minister who was cautiously overseeing
painful free-market reforms.
   Suddenly, Poland's press was engaged in a frantic effort to
discredit Tyminski. In raucous news conferences, journalists mixed
hard-hitting questions with ineffectual polemics, derisive laughter
and outright condemnation.
   Tyminski has largely stood his ground with eerie calm and
clipped replies, often refusing to answer straightforward
questions.
   ``This is the first campaign of this sort in Poland, so our
journalists do not have enough experience,'' said Maciej Ilowiecki,
chairman of the Association of Polish Journalists.
   After a ``sluggish'' start, he said, reporters ``tried to make
up for this professional neglect. I think they tipped the scale to
the other side ... and forgot about valid, ethical rules.''
   For example, on Tuesday night, state television broadcast an
interview with a couple who said they were friends of Tyminski's
wife, Graciela, in Canada.
   The pair said Tyminski had abused her and refused food and
medicine to his children, that a child-protection agency once
investigated him.
   But the television network never gave Tyminski a chance to
respond to the allegations.
   On Wednesday morning, Tyminski's campaign dismissed the
broadcast as ``slander.''
   The media should build a solid base of facts, ``before you show
he beats his wife,'' said Szczypiorski.
   ``Only in the second round, four days before election ends,
someone goes to Canada,'' he said. ``It was their duty to do it
four months earlier.''
   Poland's press does not have a tradition of objective
journalism, of establishing a clear line between reporting and
editorializing.
   Tyminski has accused television of ``dealing only with filth and
lies'' and the press of conspiring against him. His stance has won
support.
   ``I will vote for Tyminski thanks to journalists,'' Warsaw
resident Jerzy Krosmicki said. ``The reporters' behavior convinced
me that there is no democracy.''
   However, it appears some voters now are beginning to question
Tyminski. An independent opinion poll Wednesday showed Walesa
leading 61 percent to 20 percent, compared with 58 percent to 30
percent a week ago.
   Still, pollsters caution that Tyminski may do better at the
ballot box. They say the current atmosphere may encourage some of
his supporters to hide their preference.

<HEAD>Dollar Rebounds, Stocks Gain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar strengthened against the yen today,
while Tokyo share prices continued to gain moderately in thin
trading.
   The dollar closed at 134.05 yen, up 0.63 yen from Wednesday's
close of 133.42 yen. It opened at 133.90 yen and ranged between
133.70 yen and 134.17 yen.
   Thursday's spot trading totaled some $8.68 billion, compared
with $9.94 billion the previous day.
   Currency traders said the dollar's initial advance followed its
overnight rise in New York, where it was boosted by Secretary of
State James A Baker III's remark that the United States would
strike decisively if it chooses to use force try to drive Iraqi
troops out of Kuwait.
   The dollar, which closed at 127.13 yen on Nov. 22, has gained
recently amid uncertainties over the Persian Gulf crisis. The U.S.
currency is seen as a safe haven in times of international tension.
   The possibility of war in the gulf also tends to weaken the yen
because Japan imports virtually all of its oil, with about 70
percent of the imports coming from the Middle East.
   Yuko Fukakusa, a dealer with Tokai Bank, said sentiment favoring
the dollar basically remained strong.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
331.11 points on Wednesday, added another 359.38 points, or 1.62
percent, closing at 22,553.10. Volume on the first section totaled
330 million shares, down from 350 million on Wednesday.
   The index rose on index-linked buying and arbitrage buying, in
which investors seek profits from price gaps between the spot and
futures markets, securities dealers said.
   ``Judging from the day's small trading volume, it is too early
to say that the market actually gained confidence,'' said Atsushi
Sugihara of New Japan Securities Co.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds slid to 86.68 from Wednesday's close of
87.22. Their yield rose to 7.345 percent from 7.225 percent.

former army general whose eight years in power were ended by
massive street protests, resigned Thursday, a spokesman in the
president's house said.
   Fulfilling a vow he made to opposition leaders, Ershad handed
over power to a caretaker vice president, Shahabuddin Ahmed, who
had been nominated by the country's top opposition leaders.
   Ershad's press secretary, Toab Khan, said Ershad administered
the vice president's oath of office to Shahabuddin, chief justice
of the Supreme Court. Ershad then resigned as president, Khan said.

   New York City has proposed a $1.8 billion
anti-crime plan that would add nearly 3,500 officers to the police
force and would be paid for in part by a new, city-only lottery
game.
   The six-year program announced Wednesday also includes increases
in property and income taxes and comes amid rising fear of street
crime, dramatized by a string of slayings of children hit by stray
bullets.
   The income-tax increase and the lottery need the approval of the
state Legislature. The city can raise property taxes on its own.
   The program, which would cost about $300 million a year, was put
together by Mayor David Dinkins and the City Council. It comes at a
time when the city is trying to bridge a budget shortfall through
cutbacks in other city agencies.
   ``We have had enough of crime, enough of bloodshed, enough of
the suffering and the tears which flow in the wake of criminal
activity,'' Dinkins said Wednesday.
   Officials said the lottery would bring in $50 million to $120
million each year.
   The police force now has about 25,000 officers.
   The program provides for more money for prosecutors, Legal Aid
lawyers, prisons and drug treatment. The plan also calls for
improving security in schools, reducing delinquency and finding
jobs for high school graduates.
   Herb Berman, chairman of the City Council finance committee,
said homeowners would pay about $10 more in property taxes in the
first year and about $25 at the end of the program. The city's
surcharge on personal income tax that expires in mid-1993 would be
extended.

<HEAD>State Supreme Court Upholds Georgia Anti-Mask Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Ku Klux Klansman arrested for wearing his hood
in public lost a state Supreme Court bid to overturn a 39-year-old
ban on masks.
   The court voted 6-1 Wednesday to reject arguments by Klansman
Shade Miller Jr. that the Georgia law enacted to curb Klan activity
is unconstitutional.
   The justices said the 1951 law does not violate free-speech
rights and is a legitimate attempt to prevent violence and
intimidation.
   The decision overruled a Gwinnett County judge who dismissed
misdemeanor charges against Miller for wearing a mask in public.
   Attorney General Michael Bowers said Miller faces arrest if
caught wearing his Klan hood but did not say whether the initial
charge might be pursued.
   The offense carries up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine.
   Disguise is commonly used by those committing crimes of violence
and intimidation, Chief Justice Harold G. Clarke said.
   ``A nameless, faceless figure strikes terror in the human
heart,'' he wrote for the majority. ``But remove the mask, and the
nightmarish form is reduced to its true dimensions. The face
betrays not only the identity, but also human frailty.''
   Miller's lawyer, Michael Hauptman, said that the high court's
description of the no-mask law's range might allow for Klan members
to wear hoods in explicitly non-threatening situations, such as a
parade.
   Bowers said he didn't interpret the ruling that way. ``If his
client wears a mask, it'll make my day,'' he said.
   The lone dissent came from Justice George T. Smith, who said he
found the la unconstitutional on First Amendment grounds.
   It is ``a content-based restriction on political speech directed
to a dissident group in a public forum, and is not narrowly
tailored to serve a compelling state interest,'' he said.
   The Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith called the rulihng
``a rejection of Klan-inspired intimidation and a blow to
extremism.''

   Cautious in everything he did, Northwest pilot
Bill Lovelace seemed like the last person who would get caught in
the fiery Detroit airport crash that killed eight people, friends
say.
   Lovelace, an accomplished magician and woodworker as well as
veteran pilot, was just putting his life life back together after a
bankruptcy and an illness that kept him from flying for five years.
   Then on Monday, the Northwest DC-9 he was commanding collided on
a runway with a Northwest Boeing 727. Eight people on the DC-9 were
killed and 24 injured.
   Lovelace, whose own injuries were minor, once was a DC-9 flight
instructor. He had logged 20,000 hours of commercial flying in a
career spanning 24 years, friends and Northwest officials said.
   ``I don't honestly believe it was his negligence'' that led to
the collision, said Dave Giannini, who lives across the street from
Lovelace in a moderately affluent Phoenix neighborhood whose
residents range from retirees to families with young children.
``That guy was a straight guy. ... Even driving a vehicle he was
really cautious.''
   ``I would never hesitate to fly with him,'' added Giannini's
wife, Barbara.
   Monday's flight would have been Lovelace's 13th since returning
to work on Nov. 25 after five years on disability for treatment for
kidney stones. It was also his first flight without the company of
a supervising pilot.
   The cause of the crash is under investigation, but according to
a transcript obtained by NBC, Lovelace indicated to the control
tower he had become lost in the fog moments before the accident.
   The Federal Aviation Administration recertified Lovelace as fit
to fly on Oct. 10 and he returned to the air after two weeks of
ground training and 13 hours of simulator flying.
   ``Flying was his No. 1 love. He talked about it often,'' said
Judy Wells, a friend of 3{ years.
   Three weeks before returning to active duty, Lovelace had been
declared bankrupt under a petition he had filed in mid-July in
Phoenix. Court papers listed debts of about $152,000 against assets
of $106,000 and a monthly income of $4,212 in pension and
retirement benefits.
   His bankruptcy laywer, David Engelman, said part of Lovelace's
debt stemmed from an unsuccessful gift shop that he sold in 1989.
   Divorced and with two grown children, Lovelace remarried in
September.
   No one answered the dor at his home Wednesday, where a neatly
trimmed kumquat tree graces the front yard of the one-story stucco
house.
   But several neighbors and friends described him as a friendly,
helpful, conscientious person, as well as a talented magician and
woodworker.
   ``Good enough to be professional,'' Jack Wall said of the magic
shows Lovelace performs for schools and hospitals under the name
The Great Orsini.
   Friends said he also turns out prize-winning wooden bowls on a
lathe in his garage and in his backyard workshop. Lovelace has told
of spending 40 to 50 hours on a woodworking project, getting it
just right.
   ``His house, shop - anything he did - had to be just right,''
said Giannini.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly a year after a U.S. invasion
installed President Guillermo Endara, the government remains so
weak that it needed American GIs to put down an attempted mutiny
led by a disaffected officer.
   Wednesday's rebellion, in a Panamanian sergeant was killed, was
the most serious challenge mounted to the year-old Endara
government and a setback in U.S. efforts to foster a stable
government.
   Washington agreed just over a decade ago to cede control over
the Panama Canal at the end of the century.
   The Bush administration removed dictator Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega last Dec. 20 in an invasion it said was justified because
it put a democratically elected politician in office and fostered a
return to well-being in Panama.
   But the economy remains depressed despite Endara's efforts to
revive it. He has cut government spending, sold off money-losing
state companies and instituted other belt-tightening measures.
   About 30,000 of Panama's 100,000 public workers held a 24-hour
strike Wednesday called by the Coordinator of Unions, an umbrella
group that includes Noriega supporters.
   Strike leaders threaten longer strikes to continue pressing for
job security, easing austerity, and wage raises, which Endara says
Panama's economy - based on small canal revenues and a meager
agriculture - cannot afford.
   Workers' pay is still low, about 200,000 people out of a
population of 2.4 million remain jobless. At $3.5 billion, Panama's
foreign debt is the highest per capita in Latin America.
   On Tuesday afternoon, while about 40,000 public workers were
holding a street demonstration, the former deputy national police
chief escaped from jail on the Pacific island of Nao.
   Retired Col. Eduardo Herrera Hassan, who was awaiting trial on
charges of plotting against the government, flew to his former
Panama City headquarters, where the government says he tried to
organize an uprising.
   Herrera accused the government of humiliating members of the
National Police, the entity created in January to replace Noriega's
disbanded Defense Forces. The 13,000-strong force includes many
former Defense Forces soldiers.
   Herrera had been named national police deputy chief but was
removed in August and jailed in October.
   After his escape, he radioed units nationwide for support. But
except for a few dozen supporters, the National Police remained
loyal to Endara.
   Endara summoned a special joint U.S.-Panamanian task force to
quell the mutiny. The force of 500 troops, led by American
soldiers, had been helping the hitherto untrustworthy police keep
order since the invasion.
   Their attempts to rally Panamanian troops unsuccessful, Herrera
and his co-conspirators tried to flee military headquarters and a
Panamanian sergeant was killed and three civilians wounded in the
shooting that followed.
   Herrera, a hard-nosed veteran trained in Israeli and the U.S.
military schools, was captured along with 35 others. Fifteen rebels
were at large.
   Some 120,000 U.S. troops are stationed in the country, and the
joint patrolling agreement they have with the Panamanians expires
at the end December. Due to the political uncertainty and questions
about the loyalty of the National Police, it appears that agreement
could be extended.
   Tuesday was the first time since 1925 that a Panamanian
president formally asked U.S. troops to help restore order. The
last time, they helped quell riots to protest increases in housing
rents.
   U.S. troops weren't invited last December. They just roared in
from bases inside and outside Panama, crushed the Defense Forces
and flew Noriega to Miami to stand trial on drug trafficking and
money laundering charges.
   Some 370 Panamanians were killed in the fighting then.
   Endara, who had won handily in May 1989 elections that Noriega
annulled, was sworn in as president just as U.S. troops made their
move.
   Corruption remains widespread in Panama, having thrived during
the years of military rule that began when Gen. Omar Torrijos
seized power in 1968. Military-dominated regimes succeeded his
dictatorship when he died in a mysterious plane crash July 31,
1981.
   Seven puppet civilian governments came and went at Noriega's
whim while he wielded power as Defense Forces chief in the 1980s.
   A cousin close to Torrijos, Herrera was also a Noriega crony
until the two had a falling out and the dictator packed him off as
military attache to Israel. When Herrera returned in January,
Endara put him in charge of demilitarizing the police.
   Herrera told reporters shortly before his arrest Wednesday that
he was not leading a coup but trying to dramatize the disaffection
of the former military turned policemen.
   Many of them are known to miss the power and the perks they once
had. No military force was created after Noriega's Defense Forces
were disbanded.
   Panama seized independence from Colombia in 1903 with U.S.
warships standing off its coasts by to help. After that, the U.S.
government built, ran and owned the Panama Canal.
   In 1978, the treaties ceding the canal to Panama 2000 were
ratified and Panama became its titular owner.
   The two governments now jointly administer the waterway, and the
U.S. Southern Command keeps its troops on 11 military bases along
the canal's shores. Under the treaties, the bases are to be
eliminated by the year 2000.

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz will meet with
President Bush in Washington on Dec. 17 in an effort to resolve the
Persian Gulf crisis peacefully, diplomats disclosed today.
   Speakingon condition of a anonymity, the sources said the date
was fixed after a series of meetings this week between U.S. Charge
D'affaires Joseph Wilson and Deputy Foreign Minister Nizar Hamodun.
   Bush had invited Aziz to Washington during the week of Dec. 10
and said he would later send his secretary of state, James A. Baker
III, to meet with President Saddam Hussein in a last attempt to
avert war over Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Bush announced on Friday that he was willing to ``to go the
extra mile'' for a peaceful settlement to the crisis.
   But he said he will not accept anything short of a complete
Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, the release of all foreigners held
hostage by Iraq.
   Bush made the diplomatic overture a day after the U.N. Security
Council passed a resolution setting a Jan. 15 deadline for Iraq to
withdraw from Kuwait or face the possibility of being forced out in
a military strike.

<HEAD>Boston City Council Votes to Abolish School Board</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The City Council voted to abolish Boston's
13-member school board, accusing it of ``ripping off the
taxpayers'' and failing to educate the city's children. The move
needs the approval of the governor and Legislature.
   The City Council approved 10-3 Wednesday a measure to put
education of the city's 57,000 public school children under the
direct control of the council and Mayor Raymond Flynn.
   Flynn said legislative approval would put Boston in the
forefront of education reform.
   The School Committee, as the elected board is known, had been
criticized for failing to find a new superintendent. Last week it
called off its eight-month search.
   The quality of the city's schools had also come under attack, as
had the board's failure to close a $12 million deficit in this
year's $389.5 million budget.
   ``The School Committee over there has been ripping off the
taxpayers unmercifully,'' said Councilman Albert ``Dapper'' O'Neil.
``Today is D-Day.''
   ``No matter what the particular issue, nothing happens, or if it
happens, it's done in an incorrect way,'' said Councilman James
Byrne, who proposed abolishing the board.
   School Committee president Daniel Burke said the move was
politically motivated and not in the school system's best
interests. Committee member Robert Cappucci said Flynn is involving
himself in an issue he cannot handle.
   ``For the mayor to assume that he is going to be the answer to
quality education is ridiculous,'' Cappucci said.
   If the move is approved by the state, School Committee members
will be forced to step down at the end of the current school year.
   Flynn said he was optimistic about passage because he expected
lawmakers to see the correlation between Boston's high homicide
rate and its poor schools.
   ``We're seeing turmoil in our city because public education has
failed the schoolchildren,'' he said.
   Councilman Charles Yancey, who voted against the measure, said,
``We are depriving the right to vote by the people of Boston. It
was ramrodded through, and I think my colleagues will regret this
decision.''

   Richard Dunne was known as The Walking Man. He
loved to borrow classical music tapes from the library and listen
to them through headphones as he wandered the streets. Then he was
killed by a hit-and-run driver.
   The death of the 51-year-old retarded man has suburban Northlake
neighbors up in arms. The mayor is offering a reward out of his own
pocket in hopes of tracking down the driver who hit Dunne last
week.
   ``He got cheated by life when he was born, and now he's been
cheated out of the rest of his life,'' said Jerry Dunne, who cared
for his retarded brother.
   Northlake Mayor Reid Paxson, who is offering a $500 reward,
lamented the lack of witnesses to the fatal collision.
   ``Sometimes people have their memories jogged if there's a
reward involved, Paxson said Wednesday. ``I think the family could
accept it if it were an accident. They can't accept this.''
   Dunne's death brought an outpouring of grief from Northlake
residents. They had come to expect to see Dunne walking the streets
in a sport coat and tie, headphones on, listening to classical
music as he had for the 11 years he lived in town.
   ``The wake was loaded with people,'' his brother said. ``He knew
more people in this town than I did, and I've lived here 27
years.''
   Dunne and another brother, Gene, were born retarded, Jerry Dunne
said. They moved into Jerry's upstairs bedrooms after their mother
became too old to care for them. The pair became known for their
habit of walking everywhere.
   ``We accepted them as they were, and they accepted us `sane'
people for what we are,'' Paxson said.
   Dunne visited the Northlake Public Library almost daily,
although he couldn't read or write. He spent hours copying pictures
out of the Bible and listening to music.
   Tchaikovsky's works were among Dunne's favorites, said research
librarian Karen Ryeacki, who met him when she began working at the
library six years ago.
   ``He was one of our regulars. He would come in during the day,
leave for dinner or lunch, then come back in the evening,'' Ryeacki
said. ``There were some things he did not have. But he had gifts.
He could tell when someone was having a bad day, and he always had
a kind word.''
   Dunne did not visit the library the night he died, Nov. 29. A
police officer spotted him standing on a street corner about 6:45
p.m., Police Chief Seymour Sapoznik said.
   Twenty minutes later, a factory worker on break found him
sprawled on the ground, Sapoznik said. No witnesses have come
forward, although the corner usually is heavily traveled at that
time of night, police said.
   Police are distributing fliers to businesses in the community of
about 12,000 people in the search for clues, Sapoznik said.
   ``He was the town walker, and everyone knew and liked him,''
Sapoznik said. ``Why would someone run when it's just an
accident?''

<TEXT>
   The Associated Press and the Wire Service Guild
reached tentative agreement on a two-year contract covering more
than 1,300 employees nationwide.
   The agreement, which would replace a contract that expired
Friday, provides for raises of 2.8 percent in the first year and
2.3 percent in the second.
   ``I think it's a realistic contract and I think that given the
economic climate in the industry and its obvious impact on us,
that's what makes it realistic,'' D. Byron Yake, AP director of
human resources, said Wednesday.
   ``The other side of that is that we're pleased we can offer a
contract that has raises and not freezes and cuts.''
   Kevin Keane, Guild president, said, ``Obviously, the bargaining
committee is disappointed with the size of the wage increase. But
they worked hard, and we're convinced that this is the best
contract we can get, given the labor and economic climate.''
   He said the Guild was recommending ratification by the
membership.
   The contract calls for pay increases that would raise top scale
for newspersons and photographers from $720 to $740 weekly in the
first year of the contract, and from $740 to $757 in the second
year.
   Economic differentials also would go up in the second year of
the contract. News staff employees in New York and Washington would
receive a $10 a week increase in the differential, bringing it to
$97. The differential in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Boston and
Chicago would go up $15, to $60.
   The contract also offers improved retirement benefits for those
already retired and service credits for active participants in the
pension plan.
   The tentative pact cuts paid maternity leave for women from four
weeks to one week while keeping one week paid paternity leave for
men, and changes unpaid leave time from 18 months to 12 months for
both men and women.
   Under the old contract, men were not given unpaid paternity
leave.
   In addition, women on maternity leave will be allowed to use
eight weeks' full-pay disability regardless of their length of
employment.

   Doctors say a drug taken by transplant
recipients to prevent organ rejection will be tested on diabetics
to see if it helps them fight the disease.
   The drug, FK-506, already has shown promise in reversing the
effects of some types of skin diseases, leading researchers to
study whether it will halt the onset of a related type of diabetes,
said Dr. Thomas Starzl.
   Starzl heads the University of Pittsburgh's transplant program,
where about 800 patients since February 1989 have taken the drug to
prevent their white blood cells from rejecting donor organs.
   He said Wednesday that the drug also shows promise in treating
auto-immune diseases, in which the body's white cells destroy
healthy cells.
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved a two-year
test of the drug on 60 Type 1 diabetes patients, Starzl said.
   FK-506 has already reversed the effects of psoriasis, a skin
disease that creates unsightly lesions, in all six patients who
took it, Starzl said.
   The drug also reversed the effects of pyoderma gangrenosum, a
rare skin ulcer, in six of seven patients, he said.
   ``We're seeing some very dramatic recoveries,'' said Starzl who
performed the world's first successful human liver transplant in
1967.
   He said researchers want to move ahead quickly with the tests on
people with Type I diabetes, in which a person's white cells
destroy their pancreas' insulin-producing factories, requiring that
the person take insulin shots to survive.
   ``We are anxious to get the information out that there is
something that could switch off this disease,'' he told reporters.
   At least 11 million Americans suffer from Type 1 diabetes, which
can cause blindness and kidney failure. Its symptoms are excessive
thirst, frequent urination, rapid weight loss and blurred vision.
   FK-506, which is derived from a fungus, is taken orally twice a
day. It is manufacturered by the Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co. of
Japan.
   Transplant patients using the drug have displayed such side
effects as dizziness and excessive dreaming, said Dr. Patricia
Carroll of the university's medical school. But she said side
effects haven't shown up in people who have taken the drug but who
have not undergone transplants.

<HEAD>Doctor Says High-Impact Aerobics May Cause Vertigo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   High-impact aerobics enthusiasts bouncing their
way to trim tummies and tight tushes may also be jolting their
inner ears into episodes of vertigo and inviting hearing loss from
loud workout music, a doctor says.
   Dizziness, ringing in the ears and loss of balance were found
among aerobics teachers and others who do the popular form of
exercise frequently, Dr. Michael I. Weintraub of New York Medical
College wrote in today's issue of The New England Journal of
Medicine.
   Five recent cases prompted him to question 37 high-impact
aerobics instructors at two fitness clubs, Weintraub said. Results
suggested a link between the exercising and shock to the ears that
could be causing damage to the inner ear, he said.
   Aerobics exercising, popularized by actress Jane Fonda in the
1980s, features repeated jumping and running in place. High-impact
aerobics exercising is an advanced, more intense form of aerobics
workouts.
   Among the five cases that alerted Weintraub was a 29-year-old
woman aerobics teacher who suffered vertigo, skewed balance that
caused her to inadvertently to veer to the right and hearing loss.
   In another case, a 20-year-old aerobics enthusiast suffered
vertigo and general dizziness after exercising. A 42-year-old
instructor suffered reduced hearing in one ear.
   A 35-year-old instructor reported a muffled sound in one ear and
sense of imbalance that worsened after exercising, and a
26-year-old enthusiast had a 7-month history of dizziness and
hearing problems during and after exercises.
   ``The hearing loss ... was thought to be related to exposure to
the loud music played during the exercise routine,'' Weintraub
wrote.
   Of the 37 instructors questioned, Weintraub said five reported
episodes of vertigo and some hearing loss, and eight reported
tinnitus - ringing or buzzing in the ear.
   The injuries came despite the use of specially cushioned shoes,
he said.
   Vertigo is a loss of balance commonly accompanied by a whirling
feeling or the feeling that things surrounding the sufferer are
spinning. Possible dangers from aerobics need more study, Weintraub
said.
   ``In calling attention to this potential association, I do not
intend to discourage high-impact aerobics but rather to urge an
increased awareness among clinicians as well as exercise
instructors and enthusiasts,'' he said.

<HEAD>Marine Who Wouldn't Report to Persian Gulf Discharged;
Court-Martial Dropped</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BEN DIPIETRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first Marine to refuse orders to go to the
Persian Gulf says now that he's won a military discharge he'll
fight to keep his former colleagues out of war.
   The Marine Corps agreed Wednesday to grant Jeff Paterson an
administrative discharge and drop court-martial proceedings against
him in exchange for his dropping legal action against the military.
   ``I think now I'll be in a better position to mobilize support
against the war,'' said Paterson who attended a celebration at a
local coffehouse late Wednesday. ``I'll continue speaking out and
being very vocal against the war.''
   In a related development Wednesday, Army Spec. Sebastian Correa
sued the military and President Bush for extending his active-duty
enlistment because of the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Correa's four-year active-duty tour was to have ended Nov. 24.
In early September he was asked if he wanted to re-enlist; he
declined. Two weeks later, Correa, 24, was sent to Saudi Arabia,
and two weeks after that he learned his tour was extended until
December 1991.
   Paterson, 22, was accused of violating orders for refusing to
board a plane for Saudi Arabia with his unit on Aug. 29.
   He also was charged with unauthorized absence on Aug. 16, when
he failed to report for duty to hold a news conference announcing
his plans to seek conscientious objector status.
   The Marines denied that request, saying it was based on
political and not moral considerations and they didn't believe it
was sincere.
   Paterson said Wednesday he might have helped the anti-war
movement more if he had fought the charges at a court-martial.
   ``But the government probably would have won their case and I
would have been in jail,'' he said. ``I have no desire to be a
martyr.''
   He and his lawyer, Eric Seitz, said the military decided to drop
the court-martial to avoid negative publicity. But Paterson's
commanding officer, Brig. Gen. R.L. Phillips, said it would have
been too disruptive to the military's Operation Desert Shield to
have soldiers in the Persian Gulf take time to file depositions in
the case.
   ``The expeditious discharge of Lance Corporal Paterson ... was
in the best interests of the United States government and the U.S.
Marine Corps.,'' Phillips said in a statement Wednesday.
   Seitz said Paterson will be sent to Camp Pendleton, Calif.,
within the next few days to be formally discharged. As part of the
discharge he is being reduced in rank from corporal to lance
corporal.
   In two other conscientious objector cases:
   -Pvt. Alfred Edwin Esquibel Jr., who refused to carry a gun to
Saudi Arabia, was discharged Tuesday from the Army on grounds of
fraudulent enlistment, said Bill Harralson, Army spokesman at Fort
Campbell, Ky.
   -A special court-martial, which carries a lighter sentence than
a general court-martial, was recommended for Sgt. George Morse of
Fort Riley, Kan., who was charged with refusing orders to prepare
military equipment for transport to Saudi Arabia.
   Esquibel and Morse requested conscientious objector status.

   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein today
called for the release of all foreign hostages, saying recent
diplomatic moves have prompted him to ``respond to positive
changes,'' the Iraqi News Agency reported.
   Saddam also said the hostages' presence was no longer needed to
deter attack because his forces were fully deployed in Kuwait.
   Saddam, who rules parliament with an iron hand, asked the body
to approve the hostages' release, the official report said. It was
assumed the hostages would be freed immediately after parliament's
approval.
   The report did not say exactly when he wanted the estimated
2,000 Westerners, including 1,000 Americans, to be freed. About 90
of the detained Americans have been held at strategic sites to
deter an attack on Iraqi forces. Saddam previously had said he
would free all hostages over a three-month period beginning
Christma Day, ``if nothing mars the atmosphere of peace.''
   His decision was apparently a reaction to a decision by
President Bush last week to propose direct U.S.-Iraqi talks on the
Persian Gulf crisis. Iraq has accepted the offer for high-level
negotiations.
   Saddam's message also comes exactly one week after passage of a
U.N. resolution authorizing force against Iraq by Jan. 15 if its
fails to withdraw from Kuwait. The United States also recently
announced it would dramatically boost its forces in the Persian
Gulf region.
   The Iraqi New Agency, monitored in Nicosia, said Saddam urged
parliament to act in a letter he sent to the National Assembly
Chairman Sadi Mehdi Saleh.
   The agency quoted Saddam as saying in the letter: ``We deem it
necessary that our National Council convene to take a final and
irrevocable stand toward a humanitarian issue which you and the
rest of the world are aware of.''
   He said the most annoying factor of the gulf standoff was that
``some people with no confrontational or evil intentions were
caught in the middle.
   ``Some of the foreigners who have been prevented from travel
fall under that category.''
   Saddam said that when the travel ban was first announced, Iraqi
forces ``had not completed their mobilization in Kuwait to confront
a potential military aggression.
   ``Any measure that could delay war at the time was appropriate
... so that we use the opportunity to complete preparations for
that possibility,'' Saddam said, according to the Iraqi News Agency
text.
   ``But now our forces, with the blessings of the almighty, are
fully prepared to defend our values and principles against the
traitors and infidels ... and to defend our national, regional and
humanitarian wealth,'' he said.
   ``We had suggested different timing,'' for the release of
hostages, Saddam said, referring to the previous offer to allow the
foreigners to leave in batches over a three-month period starting
Dec. 25.
   But, he added, that recent overtures have prompted him to
``respond to positive changes.''
   Iraq this week accepted a Bush administration proposal to hold
talks on the crisis, which began when Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug.
2.
   CNN on Wednesday quoted a ranking Iraqi source it did not
identify as saying, ``All issues are on the table, everything.'' It
said Saddam was feeling enormous pressure to withdraw from Kuwait.
   Saddam told Parliament: ``I invite you to take a just decision
to end the travel ban imposed on foreigners and restore to all of
them the freedom to travel. We apologize to those who may have been
harmed, and from God we seek forgiveness.''

   Iraq is accepting President Bush's offer to
hold talks on the occupation of Kuwait, but the gap between the two
sides remains wide as Secretary of State James A. Baker III
testifies on Capitol Hill.
   Baker plans to use his trip to Baghdad to reiterate three U.S.
demands - that Iraq withdraw from Kuwait, free all foreign hostages
and permit the return of the ousted Kuwaiti government.
   Iraq today appeared to move closer to accepting one of those
demands when President Saddam Hussein called for the release of all
foreign hostages, saying recent diplomatic moves have prompted him
to ``respond to positive changes.''
   The Iraqi News Agency reported that Saddam said the hostages'
presence was no longer needed to deter attack because his forces
were fully deployed in Kuwait. Saddam, who rules parliament with an
iron hand, asked the body to approve the hostages' release, the
official report said. It was assumed the hostages would be freed
immediately after parliament's approval.
   Sadiq al Mashat, the Iraqi ambassador, told reporters Wednesday
that the Palestinians' dispute with Israel is the ``backbone'' of
Iraqi policy.
   ``It has to be addressed some way or another,'' he said. ``Let
us negotiate and arrive at a peaceful settlement which would be in
the interest of everybody in the region.''
   Al Mashat coupled that statement with a warning to the United
States: ``If you are going to war you are going to receive ashes
and animosity.''
   Baker, who appears today before the House Foreign Affairs
Committee, would go to Baghdad after Tariq Aziz, the Iraqi foreign
minister, comes to Washington for talks with Bush.
   Testifying Wednesday to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
Baker appealed for broad support for the administration's Persian
Gulf policy.
   Amid rising dissent, Baker said, ``we ought to send a clear
signal here that there is a willingness and a resolve to threaten
the use of force in a credible way so this man (Saddam) will know
if he doesn't leave peacefully force could be used against him.''
   Taking a tough line, Baker said his message to Saddam would be:
``Get out of Kuwait or risk all.''
   He said he would not negotiate with Saddam, and added a new
warning: ``If force must be used, it will be used suddenly,
massively and decisively.''
   Meanwhile, Bush said in a news conference in Buenos Aires,
Argentina, that the United States would make no effort to give
Saddam a face-saving way out.
   ``When naked aggression takes place, it's not a question of
finding face for the aggressor,'' the president said. ``When a
country is literally raped and pillaged, should the world go out
and try to find a way to save face for he who has raped and
pillaged that country?''
   Baker, meanwhile, said a trade embargo and other economic
sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Counil after the
Aug. 2 invasion had not worked. He said he was ``very pessimistic''
they would compel Saddam to withdraw, and said that also was the
judgment of intelligence experts.
   ``Put bluntly, this is the last best chance for a peaceful
solution,'' Baker said of his forthcoming trip to Baghdad, which
Iraq has accepted in principle with the details still to be worked
out.
   He said he would not negotiate with the Iraqi president on
subjects unrelated to the seizure of Kuwait.
   ``I will not be negotiating the Palestinian question or the
civil war in Lebanon,'' he said. ``Saddam did not invade Kuwait to
help the Palestinians. He did it for his own self-aggrandizement.''
   If Baker made any converts on the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, they were not evident.
   Committee Chairman Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., said sanctions have
not been given adequate time to work. His mail is running ``eight
or nine to one to slow down'' the rush toward military action, Pell
said. ``There is little evidence of ... impatience or of a popular
clamoring for war.''
   And Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., said, ``This is a time for the
qualities of the long-distance runner: perseverance, stamina,
determination. Lashing out may be less courageous than to stick the
course, particularly when you're talking about a significant loss
of life.''

<TEXT>
   Eleven years after the Islamic revolution
forced women under veils and banned social contact between the
sexes, President Hashemi Rafsanjani is championing a freer attitude
toward sex and social interaction.
   ``We imagine that it is good if we suppress ourselves, endure
frustrations and be patient in our sexual desires. This is
incorrect. It is wrong,'' Rafsanjani said last week at Friday
Prayers, an important forum for political statements.
   ``God has created certain needs in the human being, and he does
not want them left unanswered,'' he said, addressing thousands of
worshippers at Tehran University and millions of his countrymen
listening on radio.
   The efforts are part of a broad political and social
liberalization Ransanjani has pressed, despite sharp opposition,
since Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini died in June 1989.
   Rafsanjani's moves have ranged from such major policy steps as
encouraging private businesses and expanding ties with Western
countries to permitting more contemporary music and even making
television more lively.
   ``Why is it improper for a lady to marry twice in her lifetime?
Or to have a temporary relationship - a temporary marriage - with
someone else?,'' Rafsanjani said in his sermon.
   ``Sigheh'' or temporary marriage, according to Shiite Islam -
the branch of Islam in Iran - can be verbally contracted between
two consenting adults. They take a temporary ``vow'' before
engaging in sex.
   Attempting to make the idea of ``sigheh'' as loose as possible,
Rafsanjani said in his sermon that ``some people imagine that for a
temporary marriage we have to find a turbaned man (cleric),''
Rafsanjani said.
   ``None of this is necessary,'' he said. ``They can make a
contract for themselves, if they want to be together for a month or
two.''
   It wasn't clear whether Rafsanjani's comments Friday would
quickly lead to a liberalization of popular attitudes toward sex.
Social and moral codes are often interpreted differently from city
to city, and some religious and government leaders still hew to
Khomeini's ascetic line.
   Under Khomeini, Iran's 55 million people endured a rigidly
enforced Islamic social and religious code that outlawed even
pre-teen boys and girls from sitting together in classrooms.
   In many places, the all-pervasive neighborhood Komitehs, or
revolutionary committees, still swoop down on women who defy the
dress code that decrees they must always wear a head-to-toe robe.
   Armed, uniformed Komiteh militants still raid parties where both
sexes are allowed to mingle.
   Rafsanjani's sermon drew wide attention.
   ``He is calling for men and women to mingle in public, to eat
together in restaurants, to walk around in the parks, to be
normal,'' a university professor in Tehran said on condition of
anonymity.
   ``In my opinion, this temporary marriage thing is to wrap these
relationships in an Islamic cloak to silence opponents,'' the
professor said.
   Rafsanjani's anti-Western, hard-line rivals, locked in a power
struggle with him, claim to be the real heirs of Khomeini,
spiritual leader of the 1979 Islamic revolution.
   They demand unflinching adherence to the patriarch's strict
teachings.
   Using Khomeini's parlance, the hard-liners have accused
Rafsanjani of favoring ``American Islam'' - a diluted version of
the real thing.
   The more open atmosphere encouraged by Rafsanjani is palpable in
the streets of Tehran, where pretty young women made up with
lipstick and eyeliner push back their headscarves to show a peek of
their carefully coiffeured hair.
   A day after Rafsanjani's sermon, a crowd in central Tehran's
Ferdowsi square pleaded on behalf of a chic young woman being
arrested for showing a lock of hair - still considered a violation
by Komiteh revolutionaries.
   Growing nervous because of the size of the crowd, the
revolutionary ``sister'' attempting the arrest relented.
   She returned to her patrol car, muttering, ``One day we'll get
your American president, then you'd better watch out.''
   Hard-liners, led by former Interior Minister Ali Akbar
Mohtashemi and Parliament Speaker Mehdi Karrubi, are vehemently
opposed to Rafsanjani's steering of the revolution in a more
liberal direction.
   They have been the target of a purge by Rafsanjani, and have
gone on the defensive since Khomeini's death.
   They agonized when Rafsanjani moved toward normalizing ties with
a number of Western countries. They endured when he said he favored
private enterprise over the stifling, government-run economy.
   But Rafsanjani's latest statements - a call to reverse what his
rivals consider the revolution's most visible ``achievements'' -
has them up in arms.
   ``I hope we will never undermine the dignity of women. We should
never hurt their feelings,'' Karrubi said in Parliament Monday.

   President Hussain Muhammad Ershad
resigned today and surrendered power to an opposition-nominated
political independent who will lead the country until elections
promised for within three months.
   Ershad, a former army general who held power for eight years,
agreed on Tuesday to step down after a seven-week campaign of large
street protests that grew only fiercer when he imposed a state of
emergency last week.
   Fulfilling a vow he made to opposition leaders, Ershad
administered the oath of office to Shahabuddin Ahmed, chief justice
of the Supreme Court.
   Ershad then resigned as president of this impoverished nation of
107 million people.
   ``Allah bless you,'' Ershad told Shahabuddin. ``You have our
blessings. I want peace to return to the society.''
   Shahabuddin, sworn in as vice president, will serve as acting
president and preside over new elections that are to be held within
90 days.
   ``I have no political ambition. I shall not stay here beyond the
mandated 90 days,'' Shahabuddin told opposition leaders after the
ceremony.
   ``During this period I shall try to ensure peace and stability,
hold free and fair elections and hand over power to the elected
representatives of the people,'' he said.
   The transfer of power was shown on state-run television.
   Ershad, wearing a black suit and looking grim, was flanked by
the chiefs of the army, navy and air force. It was the first time
he had appeared on television since Monday night, when he first
expressed a willingness to resign.
   The ceremony took place at the president's office inside Dhaka's
military cantonment, a well-guarded complex of offices and houses.
   Ershad, 60, was an army general when he seized in a 1982
bloodless coup. He resigned his military commission before running
the 1986 presidential election that opponents said he stole through
massive vote-rigging.
   Shahabuddin, 62, met the opposition leaders later in the day.
Originally, his nomination was to be approved by Parliament on
Saturday, but Ershad unexpectedly dissolved the lawmaking body this
morning.
   Constitutional experts and opposition sources said Ershad
dissolved Parliament because it was doubtful a majority of
legislators would emerge in public.
   Two-thirds of Parliament belonged to Ershad's Jatiya Party. Many
deputies were reluctant to appear in public for fear of being
attacked by anti-Ershad activists.
   Some Jatiya Party offices and officials' residences around the
country have been stoned or ransacked in the past week.
   Ershad lifted the state of emergency late Wednesday, eight days
after he imposed it because of increasingly violent demonstrations
for his removal.
   Emergency measures had included a curfew and press censorship
but street protests continued despite the deployment of troops.
   On Tuesday night, Ershad bowed to a seven-week groundswell of
opposition and said he would step down as the opposition had chosen
someone to run the country until new elections.
   The top opposition leaders, Sheik Hasina and Khaleda Zia, agreed
Wednesday night on Shahabuddin, a career lawyer and judge.
   Ershad has not been seen in public for nearly a week. But
longtime aides said he remained at his home and office inside a
Dhaka military base.
   The opposition claimed at least 100 people were killed by
security forces since the emergency was declared on Nov. 27.
Ershad's govenment said only six people died.
   Mrs. Zia and Hasina have been agitating for Ershad's ouster
since he took power. But their personal and political rivalries had
long thwarted any lasting campaign.
   Then, in October, the opposition was galvanized by Ershad's
announcement that he would be a candidate in June presidential
elections.
   Hasina, leader of the left-of-center Awami League, is the
daughter of Sheik Mujibur Rahman, Bangladesh's first president.
   Mrs. Zia, head of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, is the widow
of another former president, Ziaur Rahman. Both men were
assassinated.
   Ershad is the country's ninth president since it gained
independence from Pakistan in 1971. Like all of his predecessors,
he was installed by military action.

   One of the rising political stars of the French
right wing, Mayor Michel Noir of Lyon, quit his party today,
describing the entire political system as ``sick.''
   His resignation from the Rally for the Republic, the nation's
largest conservative party, came a day after its leader, Jacques
Chirac, denounced the concept of an integrated Europe.
   Noir, 46, loses his seat in the National Assembly by the
resignation. He had been seen by many as a potential heir to
Chirac, a former prime minister and now the mayor of Paris.
   At a news conference in Lyon, Noir accused all French political
parties of failing to provide leadership as the country faces
disturbing social ills and tough choices for its future.
   ``France is sick. Sick of the crises ... in justice, education,
safety, health,'' Noir said. ``Sick of no longer holding its
historic role on the international stage.''
   France has been rocked in recent months by strikes by students
demanding better education, protests by judges angry at political
interference, and riots by youths in suburban ghettos.
   Chirac broke a national consensus Wednesday on further
integrating the 12 countries of the European Community, declaring
Paris was ceding too much sovereignty.
   The denunciation came as President Francois Mitterrand and
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany discussed proposals on political
union ahead of next week's EC summit in Rome.
   ``We reject the conception of the French Socialists, as well as
of the Germans and of the Italians, for a federation of the 12,''
Chirac declared.
   Chirac, who lost the 1988 presidential race to Mitterrand, is
one of the most prominent politicians to oppose further EC
integration since Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain
resigned last month. His comments in many views echoed her views.
   Noir did not address the change in policy toward Europe, but his
break with Chirac appeared certain to again steep the party in the
confusion it has experienced ever since the 1988 election loss.
   The Rally for the Republic's main political ally, the Union for
French Democracy led by former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing,
strongly supports European integration. It was not immediately
clear what effect Chirac's proposals would have on the alliance.
   The resignation deprives the Rally for the Republic of its most
charismatic young leader. Noir has fared consistently well in
opinion polls and has resolutely denounced moves by party bosses to
form an electoral pact with the extreme-right National Front of
Jean-Marie Le Pen.
   Political analysts predicted that Noir would seek some sort of
national role outside the Rally for the Republic.

   America's economic future will be jeopardized
unless colleges and universities develop strategies to recruit,
retain and graduate more minorities, a report by a national task
force said today.
   The Education Commission of the States' task force said an
18-month study of colleges and universities in 10 states found
there are too few minorities in higher education and those who do
attend college often don't graduate or go on to graduate-level
programs.
   In comparison, labor statistics show that in less than 10 years,
one-third of workers entering the work force will be members of
minority groups and that a majority of all new jobs will require
postsecondary education.
   America's economic future will be ``severely jeopardized'' until
all colleges and universities place the same priority on educating
a much higher proportion of minority citizens, said the report,
entitled ``Achieving Campus Diversity - Policies for Change.''
   ``Indeed, diversity can be a source of America's strength rather
than a force that divides,'' said Garrey Carruthers, outgoing
governor of New Mexico who is chairman of the National Task Force
on Minority Achievement in Higher Education.
   To increase campus diversity, the report said states should set
two goals against which to measure their progress. Minority
enrollment in higher education should be at least proportional to
the minority population in each state. Also, minority graduation
rates should be comparable to those of other students, the report
said.
   The report studied every four-year institution in California,
Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio,
South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
   The states represented 42 percent of the nation's 1985
population and enrolled 39 percent of Native American, 42 percent
of African American and 72 percent of Hispanic college students.
The states showed declines in enrollment for all the groups.
   According to the report, colleges must ``remove barriers to
participation'' by recruiting more underrepresented students,
providing adequate financial aid, using broadened admissions
criteria and scheduling classes at convenient times for employed
adults.
   Colleges and universities also must help students achieve by
making it clear what they expect and taking steps to help students
reach academic standards. Institutions should develop partnerships
with public schools and work with community colleges to ease the
transition from two-year to four-year institutions.
   Institutions also must increase the use of mentors and academic
advising.
   The final step for colleges and universities is to use
assessment, learning assistance, better teaching strategies and
curricular reform to ``change learning environments for all
students.''

   A TWA jet that had just taken off from
Greater Cincinnati International Airport this morning was brought
back and evacuated because of an odor that smelled like smoke, an
airline spokesman said.
   TWA flight 563, headed from Cincinnati to St. Louis, took off at
7:51 a.m. and was brought back to the airport at 8:20 a.m., said
Donald Morrison, a TWA vice president in St. Louis.
   The 38 passengers and six crew members were evacuated from the
DC-9 jet by the stairs, not emergency chutes, Morrison said. The
move was only a precaution because ``there was never any fire,''
Morrison said. Mechanics were trying to determine the origin of the
smoky odor.

<TEXT>
   The man accused of killing Rabbi Meir Kahane
says he believes a Jewish man shot the militant Jewish leader to
death, according to reports published today.
   State Supreme Court Justice Alvin Schlesinger set bail Wednesday
at $300,000 for El Sayyid Nosair, 35, of Cliffside Park, N.J.,
during a hearing in Manhattan Criminal Court.
   Nosair is accused of shooting Kahane to death Nov. 5 as the
rabbi finished speaking to a Jewish group at a midtown Manhattan
hotel.
   He also is accused of wounding two other men and threatening a
third while fleeing. He was stopped when a U.S. Postal Service
police officer shot him in the neck a block from the hotel.
   New York Newsday and The New York Times reported today that
Nosair gave a statement to police in which he said he believed a
Jewish man did the shooting. Newsday said Nosair claimed the gun
was placed next to him as he lay wounded in the street.
   Nosair also said in the statement that he went to see Kahane's
lecture because he agreed with much of Kahane's anti-Arab rhetoric.
   Groups of Jews and Arabs nearly came to blows in a raucous
confrontation outside the courtroom at Wednesday's hearing.
   ``No bail for murderers!'' yelled the Jews, and the Arabs
shouted, ``God is great! Thanks be to God!'' as they met in the
13th-floor hallway.
   Nosair's lawyer, Michael Warren, was accompanied by an Egyptian
lawyer, Abdel Halim Mandour, who said he was helping in the case.
Nosair came to this country from Egypt in 1981.
   ``We will raise the bail as quickly as we can,'' Warren said.
   Warren had asked that bail be set at $100,000. He said Nosair
had never been arrested before, has a wife and child and other
relatives here, and was a responsible city employee.
   Nosair, a university-trained engineer, worked as a boiler
tender.
   Assistant District Attorney William Greenbaum opposed bail,
telling Schlesinger that the prosecution had witnesses, the murder
weapon and ballistics evidence to tie the defendant to the crimes.
   Schlesinger scheduled another hearing for March 4.

   The United States and Britain asked
their NATO allies today for more help in transporting and equipping
their forces in the Persian Gulf.
   At a NATO defense ministers meeting, British Defense Secretary
Tom King urged his colleagues to provide more ammunition, medical
equipment and chemical-warfare gear as well as ships and planes to
transport troops to the gulf.
   King told reporters Defense Secretary Dick Cheney made a similar
request on the opening day of the two-day meeting at the NATO
headquarters here.
   ``He (Cheney) expressed his appreciation for allied support'' to
date, King said. ``But we both said we were looking for further
support and contributions from other members of the alliance.''
   The United States, with about 300,000 soldiers in the gulf
region, has the largest force facing Iraq, followed by Britain,
whose total deployment will reach 30,000 over the next few weeks.
   All 16 NATO members except Germany, Iceland, Luxembourg and
Turkey have sent forces to the gulf.
   King said he received ``one or two'' informal commitments from
other NATO nations for new aid to support the British military
presence in the gulf.
   In recent weeks, Washington issued two separate appeals to its
allies for help in flying and shipping American forces to the gulf.
While the response generally has been good, officials said more
help was needed in view of the scope of the U.S. military buildup.
   The NATO defense ministers meeting comes a week after the
adoption of the United Nations resolution authorizing military
action against Iraq unless it leaves Kuwait by Jan. 15.
   He said public support for an attack on Iraq and western
credibility in the Middle East could ``slide away'' if the
27-nation force fails to stick to that deadline.
   ``The idea that you could somehow drift longer is not a credible
option,'' King said.
   Also today, the defense ministers reviewed work to date on a new
NATO defense strategy to reflect the dramatic changes in East-West
relations.
   German Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg told a news
conference there was ``a general wish'' among the allies to involve
France more closely in allied military operations.
   France, although a NATO member, does not take part in the
alliance's integrated military structure from which it withdraw in
1966.
   Stoltenberg said ``it is very important to strengthen the
European security element'' in NATO through a new defense strategy
focusing on multinational force formations with links to French
troops.
   Without elaborating, he said, ``informal'' talks with France had
already been held and were continuing.
   King said NATO's new defense strategy, due to be adopted next
year, must reflect changes in Eastern Europe yet provide the allies
with adequate defenses.
   ``Quite clearly the scale and nature of the threat has changed
but there are considerably ... instabilities remaining, not least
the rise of nationalism'' in Eastern Europe, King said.
   Officials said the new strategy will call for smaller forces,
the maintenance of some nuclear arms as well as the continued
pressence of American troops in Europe but in far smaller numbers
than has been the case since the Second World War.

<HEAD>Defense Minister: 35,000 Evaded Draft in 1990</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN FRIEDMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet defense minister said 35,000 young men
have evaded the draft this year, most in republics where
independence movements have fostered anti-military sentiment, the
official Tass news agency reported today.
   In addition, more than 4,300 deserters from the army are at
large, aided in their flight by local authorities, Tass quoted
Defense Minister Dmitry Yazov as saying at a conference of military
officials held Wednesday.
   Two thousand soldiers died in the first 11 months of 1990, and a
quarter of those were suicides, the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda
said in a report on the same conference, citing figures given by
Col. Gen. Nikolai Shlyaga, the head of the main political
directorate of the armed forces.
   The report did not specify how the other soldiers died, but many
deaths apparently were the result of hazing of draftees by veteran
soldiers.
   Many draftees refuse to serve outside their home republics
because they fear the vicious hazing that often is ethnically
motivated.
   Yazov said the draft was disrupted in the republics of Latvia,
Lithuania, Estonia, Georgia, Armenia and the western Ukraine, Tass
reported.
   As independence or nationalist movements have strengthened in
these and other republics, sentiment against the Soviet military
has been growing. Some of the breakaway republics have proposed
setting up their own armed forces.
   The Soviet military does not reveal how many youths are drafted
each year, citing state security. But every Soviet man 18 or older
must serve in the military.
   Addressing the conference of junior and middle-level officers in
the armed forces, the KGB secret police, the Interior Ministry and
the railroad troops, Yazov said that attacks on the army, its
prestige and combat traditions are directed against the integrity
of the Soviet state, Tass reported.
   ``Can you jest with the army? Well, you can insult it once or
twice, but after all, this is a man with a gun,'' Yazov said in an
interview Wednesday night with Soviet television.
   ``Some people fail to understand that it is they who the army
defends,'' he added.
   Yazov also said civilians were involved in the slayings of 69
officers and 32 warrant officers, Tass reported without further
elaboration.
   Last week, Yazov ordered a crackdown on assaults against Red
Army units, saying such actions are endangering national security.
He ordered soldiers to use weapons if any military installation is
attacked, and he urged the protection of installations from
officials who would cut off power, water or other services.
   The Soviet military announced last month it was embarking on a
10-year restructuring program to cut manpower and weaponry. The
plan includes cutting personnel from the current 4 million to about
3 million to 3.2 million. The draft will continue, but alternative
service will be allowed for those who object on religious grounds.

   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein today
called for the release of all foreign hostages from Iraq and
Kuwait, saying recent diplomatic moves helped prompt the decision,
the Iraqi News Agency said.
   Saddam also said the hostages' presence was no longer needed to
deter an attack by the U.S.-led multinational forces in the Persian
Gulf because his forces were now fully deployed in Kuwait.
   Saddam urged his compliant Parliament to approve the hostages'
release, the official report said. It did not say when the captives
would be freed, but it was assumed they would be allowed to leave
after parliament's vote.
   The 250-seat National Assembly, which has no record of ever
challenging Saddam, scheduled a meeting for late Friday morning to
debate Saddam's request, the state radio later announced.
   Relatives and friends of American and British hostages were
overjoyed when they heard their loved ones could be freed soon.
   ``This has been the hardest thing I've ever had to go through in
my life,'' said Doris Whatley of Shreveport, La., whose husband,
Donald, has been held in Iraq. ``Now ... to know he'll be coming
home, well, I'm a changed person.''
   Patricia Hale of Spring, Texas, whose husband, Ed, was seized
from an oil rig in Kuwait by Iraqi troops, said: ``This surprise is
delightful. Truly delightful. It's all we ever wanted: for the
hostages to go free.''
   In Britain, relatives of hostages in Iraq and Kuwait were also
excited.
   ``I'm over the moon. It's what we've prayed and prayed for,''
said Sue Dorrington, whose husband David is being held in Baghdad.
   Saddam's announcement coincided with a report that his foreign
minister, Tariq Aziz, will meet with President Bush in Washington
on Dec. 17 to discuss a possible settlement of the 4-month-old gulf
crisis.
   There are thousands of Western hostages in Iraq and Kuwait,
including about 900 Americans. Some 90 of the detained Americans
are believed held at strategic sites to deter attack by the
330,000-strong multinational forces.
   Despite warnings by the U.S. State Department, dozens of
Americans have traveled to Baghdad trying to win freedom for their
family members and friends.
   Saddam previously had said he would free all hostages over a
three-month period beginning Christmas Day, ``if nothing mars the
atmosphere of peace.''
   The White House today welcomed the offer as ``a hopeful sign.''
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``It shows that Saddam
Hussein realizes that his position on the hostages has earned him
the outrage of the world.''
   Britain also applauded the move.
   ``We greatly welcome this news. We have been pressing throughout
for the return of all our hostages. The sooner they are back the
better,'' said a statement for the British Foreign Office.
   A Foreign Office spokesman said, however, that the government
has received no confirmation that the approximately 1,300 British
citizens in Iraq and Kuwait will be free to leave.
   Saddam's message came one week after passage of a U.N.
resolution authorizing force against Iraq by Jan. 15 if its fails
to withdraw from Kuwait. The Iraqi New Agency, monitored in
Nicosia, said Saddam urged parliament to act in a letter sent to
National Assembly Chairman Sadi Mehdi Saleh.
   In his letter, Saddam said his decision was prompted by recent
consultations with his ``Arab brothers,'' a reference to a meeting
with King Hussein of Jordan, Palestine Liberation Organization
chairman Yasser Arafat, and Yemeni Vice President Ali Salem
al-Baidh on Tuesday.
   He said recent overtures prompted him to ``respond to positive
changes.''
   Saddam said ``the reason for which the foreigners were prevented
from travel have dinmished and have been replaced by something more
powerful - a change in the American public opionion which will
impose restrictions on the decisions and intentions of the evil
ones, led by Bush, the enemy of God.''
   But, despite this change, he said, the ``Iraqi armed forces
should maintain the highest degree of alert and vigilance because
the forces of aggression remain on our sacred soil in Saudi Arabia,
fanning the flames of fire.''
   Iraq banned foreigners from leaving in response to the allied
troop buildup in Saudi Arabia. The United States has contributed
230,000 troops and promised another 200,000. Iraq has deployed
430,000 troops in southern Iraq and Kuwait.
   Saddam said that when the travel ban was first announced, Iraqi
forces ``had not completed their mobilization in Kuwait to confront
a potential military aggression.
   ``Now that the Iraqi military is battle ready,'' Saddam said,
the foreigners should regain their ``freedom to travel.''
   ``We deem it necessary that our National Assembly convene to
take a final and irrevocable stand toward a humanitarian issue,''
he said.

   The Bush administration today welcomed Iraq's
dramatic announcement that it would free all foreign hostages as
evidence ``our strategy of diplomatic and military pressure is

   Still, the administration pressed its efforts to win

Hussein does not order his army to quit Kuwait soon. Secretary of
State James A. Baker III said releasing hostages was not enough.
   ``It does not lessen, nor should it, our determination that

Sry in sex determination,'' Dr. David Page of the Whitehead

   The European scientists said they failed to find any Sry
mutation in most women they tested who carried the gene. In those
cases, a mutation may lie in a part of the gene that was not

   William K. Black, a blunt-spoken savings and
loan regulator, once prompted financier Charles H. Keating Jr. to
write, ``Kill him dead.''
   Lawyers for the so-called Keating Five senators didn't go that
far, but they clearly were unhappy with Black's testimony Wednesday
before the Senate Ethics Committee.
   Black offered the most dramatic and damaging testimony so far in
the panel's hearings into allegations that the senators improperly
intervened with S&amp;L regulators on behalf of Keating, a financial
contributor.
   ``It is the most fundamental smear,'' declared William Taylor,
attorney for Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.
   Black, a red-bearded senior attorney with the federal
government's thrift regulatory agency, was returning to the witness
stand today for more cross-examination by the defense lawyers.
   After hearing Black on Wednesday, the Ethics Committee disclosed
it had voted to grant limited use immunity to compel the testimony
of James Grogan, the former top aide and lobbyist for Keating.
   The panel met in private for two hours today, and afterward said
Grogan would produce subpoenaed documents in an executive session
next Wednesday and undergo questioning again on Monday, Dec. 17.
The new schedule will extend the schedule of he public hearings,
now in their 13th day, and leave the date of their conclusion
further in doubt.
   Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., the committee's vice chairman, said
Grogan would be questioned in public after the executive sessions.
The senators under investigation will be questioned in public
session after Grogan's appearance, Rudman said, meaning the
hearings may run until close to Christmas.
   Black, in his first day on the witness stand, supported earlier
testimony that the senators pressured regulators to help Keating's
Lincoln Savings and Loan.
   And he raised new allegations, saying that pressure by the
senators prompted the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to delay and
relax regulatory controls on Irvine, Calif.-based Lincoln, which
subsequently was taken over by the government.
   The result, Black said, was greater losses - which taxpayers
eventually must bear - than otherwise would have occurred.
   ``This ... is probably the worst institution in America, and
instead of people trying to help bring it under control, five U.S.
senators were pushing us in the opposite direction,'' he testified.
   None of the five senators was present for Black's testimony.
Besides Cranston, they are Republican John McCain of Arizona and
Democrats Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, John Glenn of Ohio and
Donald Riegle of Michigan.
   Keating had targeted Black as a problem to be eliminated long
before.
   The Ethics Committee released copies of a memo Keating wrote to
Grogan, his lobbyist, on July 15, 1987, making clear he wanted
Black removed. In it, Keating referred to the then-House Speaker
Jim Wright, D-Texas, as an ally.
   The memo began: ``Highest Priority - Get Black,'' with the last
two words underlined.
   ``Good Grief,'' Keating wrote. ``If you can't get Wright and
Congress to get Black - kill him dead - you ought to retire.''
   Throughout Black's testimony, the defense lawyers objected,
paced, stammered and complained.
   ``Innuendo,'' said James Hamilton, attorney for DeConcini. ``...
Reckless and irresponsible.''
   ``What this witness testified to are not facts,'' said Taylor,
Cranston's attorney.
   The lawyers tangled with the committee's special counsel, Robert
S. Bennett, who called Black as a witness. Committee Chairman
Heflin settled the dispute in his unruffled drawl, saying: ``Now,
he's got wide latitude to address the witness.''
   Black said Lincoln operated like a ``Ponzi scheme,'' or
financial pyramid dependent on an ever-increasing churning of
assets.
   Its parent, Keating's American Continental Corp., was no more
than a ``shell'' that siphoned dividends from Lincoln and
distributed them through inflated salaries to Keating, his family
members and associates, Black said.
   ``We call it a scam,'' Black said. ``I think most people do.''
   Keating, the Arizona high-flier who contributed $1.3 million to
the senators' campaigns and favored causes, is under indictment in
California.
   The cost to taxpayers of paying off Lincoln's insured deposits
are estimated at more than $2 billion.
   Black testified the bank board backed off its tough position on
Lincoln in May 1988. After first taking a hard line on May 5, he
said, a Cranston aide, Carolyn Jordan, ``called two senior officers
at the bank board ... and indicated severe displeasure.''
   The board revised its policy, Black said, to let Lincoln make
new speculative investments and expand its sale of junk bonds.
   ``This led to greatly increased losses'' for the taxpayers, he
said.

<TEXT>
   Tunku Abdul Rahman, who won
independence for Malaysia from Britain in 1957 and was the nation's
first prime minister until he retired in 1970, died tonight. He was
87.
   A team of five doctors tried to save him from intestinal
bleeding and other problems for the past two days. He had been in a
coma since Wednesday.
   The chief secretary to the government, Ahmad Sarji Abdul Hamid,
made the announcement at the government's General Hospital. He said
the Tunku would be accorded a state funeral with a gun-salute,
honor guard and other tributes.
   In keeping with the Tunku's wishes, he will be buried according
to Moslem rites at the Langgar Royal Mausoleum in Alor Star, 240
miles northwest of Kuala Lumpur, Sarji said. It was customary to
refer to the prime minister as the Tunku, which means prince,
because of his royal ancestry.
   Sarji said today would be a national holiday and all official
celebrations would be canceled as a mark of respect for the Tunku.
   Flags were to be flown at half staff and the government's TV and
radio stations began broadcasting readings from the Koran. The
Tunku was a Moslem.
   The Tunku was prime minister from the time of independence until
1970. He then became secretary general of the Organization of
Islamic Conference comprising about 40 nations and served at the
headquarters in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, for a few years.
   For the past few years he had been moving around in a wheelchair
because of poor health and had been in and out of hospitals many
times.
   But he had been active, writing books and writing a column for
the Star Daily, of which he was chairman. He also had criticized
the government.
   His last major public appearance was during the campaign for the
October general elections, when he urged people to oust Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad and vote in the opposition Semangat 46
party.
   Although he helped found the United Malays National Organization
party, of which Mahathir is the president, Tunku backed the
Semangat 46 and called Mahathir a dictator. The Tunku was president
of the party when he was prime minister.

   Columbia's astronauts today lost
the only working computer terminal for operating their $150 million
observatory, once again shutting down their star-gazing efforts.
   In the latest glitch on the problem-prone scientific mission,
the flight deck computer overheated and shut down automatically
this morning. The same thing happened Sunday with the only other
similar termimal. It has remained off since then.
   Although the crew smelled something burning each time, no smoke
was reported in the cabin. There was no danger to the crew, but
their observing was halted by the second computer shutdown.
   The suspension in observations by the three ultraviolet
telescopes was expected to last until late tonight, if not longer,
as NASA scrambled to devise a plan to control the instruments from
the ground.
   ``We know it's going to be difficult,'' said mission scientist
Ted Gull. ``But we're not giving up.''
   The telescope lenses were covered for protection as ground
controllers tried to get either of the problem computer terminals
working. At the same time, they quickly developed a plan in which
the telescopes would be brought back up one at a time.
   At least one of the computer terminals is needed for the
astronauts to operate the Astro observatory's three ultraviolet
telescopes. When the computer that crashed Sunday was opened today,
its air vents were found to be clogged with lint, the astronauts
said by radio. The reason for today's problem with the second
computer was not immediately determined.
   Columbia's commander, Vance Brand, said other computer screens,
unrelated to the malfunctioning ones that guide the ultraviolet
telescopes, still were working well. The astronauts' manual
star-tracking system also appeared to be fine, and the crew planned
to use it with commands sent from the ground while efforts
continued to restore a computer.
   ``When we first start up, we're going to be slower than the crew
simply because we haven't trained or practiced it anywhere near the
way they have,'' said flight director Bob Castle.
   It was the latest setback in a flight that has already been
plagued by technical problems. As a result, the crew's astronomers
have missed roughly half the celestial targets they had hoped to
observe by now.
   Earlier, during intermittent failures of the automatic pointing
system, the astronauts wiggled a video-game-like joystick and used
a computer keyboard - the one that has since malfunctioned - to
position the telescopes manually, and got more proficient at aiming
the observatory, NASA said.
   NASA said the crew had charted just 45 of 86 intended targets
through early Wednesday. Updated figures were not immediately
available, but officials were optimistic after Wednesday's showing,
mission spokesman Al Jordan said.
   ``We expect to show an improvement,'' he said.
   Scientists had planned to begin using the observatory late
Sunday, the day the shuttle lifted off.
   The schedule for the 10-day mission is tight, but NASA said the
crew might be able to make up a few hours' viewing time toward the
end of the flight if things go well.
   An X-ray telescope with its own pointing system was unaffected
by the computer problems. NASA halted X-ray observations as a
precaution but planned to resume work later this morning. An
alignment problem was corrected Wednesday, and the instrument was
working well today.
   About 250 celestial sources of ultraviolet light and X-rays were
supposed to have been studied during the mission. Such rays, which
are emitted from galaxies, quasars and stars, cannot penetrate
Earth's atmosphere.
   The automatic system has been successful in directing the
telescopes toward a target's general area but has often failed to
find the specific object. When that occurs, an astronaut uses the
joystick and keyboard to guide the system.
   Mission scientist Ted Gull could not say when the observatory
might reach peak efficiency, but he was confident that fine-tuning
would increase viewing time.
   ``We're just learning more and more about how to use the
spacecraft,'' he said.
   Successes included observations of a white dwarf star, a star
near the end of its life; a galaxy 41 million light years away that
is believed to contain a black hole, ad Crab Nebula, a remnant of
a supernova that occurred more than 900 years ago.
   Scientists from Johns Hopkins University, principal investigator
for one ultraviolet telescope, also studied one of their main
targets - a bright quasar 1 billion light years away in the
constellation Virgo - for 30 minutes.
   Astronaut Samuel Durrance operated the system manually to find
the quasar, the brightest in the sky.
   ``It's his steady hand to which we owe our success with this
one,'' said Arthur Davidsen of Johns Hopkins.
   The automatic system ``finds the target very closely, but not
close enough to do a beautiful job - that's where the astronaut
comes in,'' he said.
   The crew took some time out Wednesday night to sing ``Happy
Birthday,'' to Beverly ``Bev'' Brand, Brand's wife, and Barbara
Hoffman, wife of mission specialist Jeffrey Hoffman.
   The mission is scheduled to end with a night landing Tuesday. It
had been scheduled for 1986 but was postponed after the Challenger
accident and was delayed six months more this year, largely because
of shuttle hydrogen leaks.

   An Italian military jet crashed in flames
into a suburban high school today, killing at least 12 people and
injuring 70, officials reported.
   Students jumped out of windows of their two-story, red brick
school to escape the smoke and flames, witnesses said. Others
trapped on the top floor were rescued by firemen on ldders.
   Rescuers found one teen-age girl uninjured under the plane's
wing and continued to dig for bodies four hours after the
midmorning crash. Bologna prosecutor Mario Forte said he expected
the death toll to remain at 12.
   Officials said all the dead were believed to be students. Many
of the injured suffered serious burns. About 200 students, aged 14
to 18, were in school at the time.
   Police said the pilot bailed out and the plane crashed minutes
later into a classroom of the school, smashing a 12-foot-wide hole
in the wall on the second floor.
   ``I saw this plane in flames coming down slowly, it seemed to
level off and then it turned suddenly and crashed into the
school,'' a witneses told state RAI television.
   Students rushed in panic escape as flames and smoke swept
through the building, witnesses said.
   ``The upper floor was full of flames and students who were
immersed in the smoke were jumping out,'' a young woman said.
   Another student was quoted by the Italian news agency ANSA as
saying: ``I was in class and saw through a window this low-flying
plane coming at us and only had time to say: `This is crazy.'''
   The plane, a Macchi 326 trainer, came down in Casalecchio di
Reno, three miles outside of this central Italian city, and crashed
into the Gaetano Salvemini technical high school.
   Air force Gen. Carlo Brandini said the plane was on a mission to
test radar effectiveness for anti-aircraft readiness. The aircraft
took off from Villafranca military airport near Verona, 55 miles
north of Bologna, and was scheduled to return there.
   The pilot ``reacted according to regulations,'' the general
said. Brandini said the pilot, whom he identified as 2nd Lt. Bruno
Viviani, hoped to make an emergency landing at Bologna's airport
after the engine trouble developed.
   ``When he saw he couldn't do it, he directed the plane toward an
open area. If the plane had cleared the school, it would have
crashed in an area of open fields,'' Brandini said from air force
headquarters in Rome.
   Brandini said the jet's only engine had developed some sort of
problem and caught fire.
   The 24-year-old pilot suffered fractured vertebrae and was
questioned by a prosecutor in the hospital, the Italian news agency
ANSA said.

<TEXT>
   The co-pilot of a DC-9 involved in a
collision that killed eight people told controllers he thought the
plane had strayed onto a runway in use, but the captain told
investigators he didn't hear him.
   National Transportation Safety Board investigator John Lauber
said Wednesday that the DC-9 co-pilot, James Schifferns, radioed
the Detroit airport control tower moments before Monday's crash to
say he thought his taxiing plane had wandered onto an active
runway. The fiery collision when a Northwest Boeing 727 struck the
DC-9 also injured 24 people.
   Lauber added that pilot William Lovelace reported he didn't hear
what Schifferns said.
   ``Had the captain heard that, he said, `I would have headed for
the weeds,' meaning he would have turned off the runway
immediately,'' Lauber said.
   A control tower supervisor who did hear Schifferns shouted,
``Stop all aircraft! Stop all aircraft!'' Lauber said.
   But it was too late to halt the 727, which was on its takeoff
roll.
   NTSB investigators said today they were putting on hold their
plans to retrace the route that led the DC-9 onto the foggy runway.
   Board spokesman Brent Bahler said the ``walkthrough'' might not
be needed because a videotape had been made of the runway area
since the accident. Using a DC-9 to retrace the route would require
that the runway be shut down, and the agency didn't want to disrupt
airport operations unnecessarily, he said.
   In Monday's collision, the 727's right wing clipped the DC-9,
tearing off its rear engine and sparking a fire that incinerated
the DC-9. No one aboard the 727 was hurt, but toxic fumes from the
fire killed eight of the 43 people aboard the DC-9.
   Lauber said investigators know the DC-9 made two wrong turns in
the fog as it prepared for takeoff.
   The first time, the crew missed a turnoff and asked the tower
for a new taxiing route, Lauber said.
   Then, Lauber said, Schifferns radioed the tower, saying, ``We
may be on the active runway.''
   Northwest said Lovelace, 52, of Phoenix, was making his first
flight without another pilot observing since his return last week
from a five-year medical leave. Schifferns, 43, of Spokane, Wash.,
joined the airline in March.
   Improved ground radar equipment designed to prevent planes from
straying onto the wrong runways was on order for the Detroit
airport and 28 others when the crash occurred, said Federal
Aviation Administration spokesman Fred Farrar.
   But Farrar said it was not certain whether the new equipment,
which tracks vehicle and aircraft movement on runways, would have
prevented the accident.
   Lauber said investigators are also examining reports that some
of the airport's runway lights may have been out at the time of the
accident.
   He said a control tower supervisor reported that all lights on
active runways were working, but the 727 crew reported that the
center lights on their runway were out.
   One DC-9 survivor, Milio Rinna, a 60-year-old health and safety
official for the United Steelworkers, on Wednesday filed the first
lawsuit over the crash. He sued Northwest in state court for at
least $10,000.
   Rinna was treated at a hospital for injuries to his hands, head
and knees and was released, said his lawyer, William L. Martens.

<HEAD>Multiparty System Would Bring Cease-Fire, Rebel Leader Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The leader of the U.S.-backed UNITA rebels
says he would sign a cease-fire in the 15-year-old civil war if
Angola's ruling party approved a multiparty system at its current
congress.
   But rebel leader Jonas Savimbi on Wednesday reiterated his call
for international forces to monitor a cease-fire, a condition
opposed by the Soviet-backed Angolan government.
   ``If they (the government) approve the multiparty system
now...what we do is sign a cease-fire,'' Savimbi told a news
conference in the country's extreme southeast corner, headquarters
for his National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, or
UNITA.
   In Luanda, more than 600 miles to the northwest, President Jose
Eduardo Dos Santos' ruling party, the Popular Movement for the
Liberation of Angola, suspended its weeklong congress Wednesday.
   The congress was expected to debate constitutional amendments to
convert the one-party state to a multiparty system. Officials
blamed printing problems that delayed distribution of documents,
but observers said party hard-liners opposed to the reforms may
have caused the suspension.
   Dos Santos opened the gathering Tuesday by calling for political
and economic reforms, saying hanging on to its Marxist ideals would
be ``rowing against the tide.''
   He predicted the party's 15-year political monopoly would end
and said resolving the civil war was essential to restoring
economic growth in the southwest African nation.
   Angola is a potentially wealthy nation, with substantial oil
deposits and diamonds. But the civil war that began after Angola
gained independence from Portugal in 1975 has killed more than
300,000 people and devastated the economy.
   Despite the end of the Cold War, the United States and the
Soviets still provide assistance to the competing factions. The
United States is giving UNITA $60 million in aid this year.
   The government controls Luanda, the capital, and other cities in
the north and central parts of the country. UNITA claims control
over much of the southeast.
   The government and UNITA have held five rounds of peace talks
this year, with a sixth round scheduled for late January in
Portugal.
   Progress toward a cease-fire has been reported, but there have
been snags over recognition of UNITA as a political party, the
mechanics of a cease-fire and integrating the two armies.
   The government rejects recognizing UNITA before a cease-fire. It
also has rejected any international peacekeeping force to monitor a
cease-fire as a violation of Angolan sovereignty.
   Savimbi called on the government to carry out the proposed
change to a multiparty system. ``Then from there, there will be no
need to say recognize UNITA or not,'' he said.
   Savimbi continued to call for an international force to monitor
any cease-fire, similar to the U.N. force deployed in Namibia to
oversee a cease-fire and elections.
   Namibia gained independence from South Africa in March under an
agreement reached by Angola, Cuba and South Africa, with backing
from the United States and the Soviet Union. The agreement also
called for Cuba's 50,000 troops supporting the Angolan government
to withdraw by July 1991. At least 35,000 have left so far.
   A similar U.N. force would give UNITA guarantees of protection
during the transition to a multi-party system and free elections,
Savimbi said. It also could provide stability when the rebel and
government armies merged under an elected government, he said.
   Savimbi also called for ``just, fair and verifiable'' elections
within a year after a cease-fire. The government has said it would
take three years to set up voting.

   A dog appearing as a witness in a cruelty
case against his owner helped the defense considerably when he
licked his master's face in court, the prosecution acknowledged
Thursday.
   King, a beagle-pointer crossbreed, ``was led in because the
judge had asked to see him, and taken out after a while,'' said
prosecutor Clas Erik Ause in the central town of Namdal.
   ``He seemed very unoffended (against his owner) and at one stage
licked his face,'' the prosecutor said.
   The local Animal Protection League had reported King's owner,
Inge Skomsvold, to the police. The league said it had received
reports from Skomsvold's neighbors that he beat King.
   Along with the evidence from King, the court heard testimony
from neighbors who gave conflicting reports on how the dog was
treated.
   The prosecution asked the court to give Skomsvold a $500 fine
and ban him from keeping animals for five years.
   But Ause said that after Wednesday's hearing the outcome of the
case was ``open.'' The verdict was due this week.

   The government plans to sell the luxury
yacht that shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis donated to it in his
will, a magazine reported Thursday.
   The 325-foot yacht once hosted royalty, heads of state and
leading jet-set personalities. Onassis also used it as the base of
his shipping operations.
   Opera singer Maria Callas, once romantically involved with
Onassis, had her own suite on the yacht. And Jacqueline Kennedy,
who later married Onassis, was another frequent guest.
   Onassis died in 1975. He stipulated in his will that if his
daughter Christina did not want the yacht - named after her - it
should go to the Greek government. Christina Onassis died in 1988.
   The yacht was handed over to the Greek navy in 1978 and was
renamed the Argo.
   It has seldom been used since. The weekly magazine Tahydromos
reported Thursday that Greece was preparing to auction it.
   The former Canadian submarine chaser was bought by Onassis in
the 1950s and was converted into a luxurious palace, complete with
priceless works of art and faucets of gold.

   Troops bound for Saudi
Arabia are getting a one-week course from an Army unit based here
so they can learn the Arab world's cultural and legal taboos before
their boots hit the desert sand.
   ``We can't be sending people to Desert Shield if they're only
halfway prepared,'' said William Allbritton, deputy director for
Plans, Training and Mobilization at Aberdeen Proving Ground 40
miles northeast of Baltimore.
   ``Often their home post has taken care of a lot, but we still
have to make certain everything is in order. If it isn't they won't
go. No ifs, ands or buts.''
   Much of the program is consumed by routine processing - dental
examinations, the issuance of gas masks, and help in preparing
wills. And there are classified briefings on anti-terrorists
measures and the rules of engagement.
   Wednesdays are for lectures on Arab culture, law and climate, as
well as the international rules of war.
   Jerry Hurst, a civilian Army employee who has lived in Saudi
Arabia, recounted in a lecture on Arab culture his shock when a
member of the Saudi National Guard held his hand as they left a
meeting in Riyadh.
   Hurst said his Saudi friend told him, ``Don't get the wrong
idea. It's part of our culture.''
   Hurst and others in the orientation warned against insulting the
Saudis' Islamic beliefs and their women.
   Capt. R. Pete Hasterton, who lectured on Saudi law, said the
U.S. command has issued a general order forbidding gambling,
drinking or drug use for the troops and civilian workers. All are
crimes in Saudi Arabia.
   Hasterton also advised the servicemen that adultery is a capital
offense and premarital sex carries a long prison sentence.
   None of the seven women in the audience said they were put off
by the subordinant status of women in Saudi Arabia.
   ``It doesn't worry me at all,'' said Cindy Martinez of Corpus
Cristi, Texas, a civilian whose job status is classified. ``I'm
ready to comply. I don't want to get into any trouble. Basically,
I'll stay in my area and not wander off.''

<TEXT>
   A top co-defendant in the Manuel Noriega case today
pleaded guilty to giving drug payoffs directly to the deposed
Panamanian leader.
   Luis del Cid, a former lieutenant colonel under Noriega, entered
his plea this morning before U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler,
capping almost a year of plea negotiations with the government.
   ``Yes I transported the money, but, well, I am repented of
having done so,'' del Cid told the judge. ``What I was doing was
following orders of a superior officer.''
   Del Cid acknowledged making at least three separate cash
transactions for Noriega. He admitted to the government's
contention that he gave Noriega $100,000 in cash from drug pilot
Floyd Carlton Caceres in November 1982. He also delivered an
envelope with $150,000 cash from Carlton nd later picked up a
suitcase stuffed with cash - all of which was delivered to Noriega.
   Among the admissions by del Cid was agreement with government
claims that he accompanied Noriega to a meeting with Fidel Castro
in Cuba in the summer of 1984 to discuss the seizure of a drug
cartel lab they had paid the Panamanian leader to protect.
   Del Cid's plea negotiations stalled in March because of his fear
that following a U.S. sentence, Panama would demand his return for
criminal prosecution. The plea agreement was signed Wednesday.
   ``The Department of Justice has now agreed to oppose deporting
or extraditing my client,'' defense attorney Sam Burstyn said.
   Del Cid was an aide to Noriega at the time of their capture
following the U.S. invasion in 1989. Prosecutors have charged he
acted as a liaison and money courier between drug traffickers and
Noriega.
   Del Cid, who faced up to 70 years in prison, could be free under
the agreement after serving as little as two years, Burstyn said.
No sentencing date was set at today's hearing.
   Diane Cossin, spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office,
released a statement that said that del Cid's the admission of
guilt today is significant. ``We will carefully consider any
cooperation and truthful testimony before making a recommendation
(regarding sentencing) to the court,'' the statement said.
   The defendant's testimony could back up that of government
witness Floyd Carlton Caceres, a former drug pilot who served 4{
years in prison.
   Del Cid is accused of accepting $200,000 in cocaine profits from
Carlton, who prosecutors said had cut a deal with Noriega at a
meeting in 1983 to pay the money in exchange for Panamanian
protection of a U.S.-bound drug shipment.
   The government has said that the money was then passed on to
Noriega.
   A Noriega attorney professed little concern about del Cid's
possible testimony.
   ``He's just another witness who is getting paid for his
testimony,'' said Jon May. ``Del Cid is just one among many
witnesses who are getting the keys to the jailhouse door from a
government that's desperate to shore up its case.''
   The defense previously disputed prosecution claims that del Cid
was a key aide to Noriega, forcing the U.S. attorney's office to
acknowledge he was not head of Panamanian intelligence, as they
first asserted.
   Noriega is accused of taking $4.6 million in bribes to ship
cocaine through Panama.

   A 16th century painting by Lucas
Cranach the Elder worth $200,000 was stolen from Prague's National
Gallery, a newspaper said Thursday.
   The daily Mlada Fronta Dnes said ``An Enamored Old Man,''
painted by the German master in 1531, disappeared on Wednesday.
   Czechoslovak radio and television announced the theft in news
bulletins, describing the missing picture. Customs authorities also
were alerted, the daily said.
   The Gallery's 13,500 paintings in several locations in Prague
include Rubens' ``Gathering of the Olympic Gods'' and Titian's
``Lady at her Toilet.'' They make up what is considered one of the
finest collections of medieval art in central Europe.
   Czechoslovakia has become a popular target for international
crime after the revolution last year that lifted travel
restrictions and eased police controls.
   ``Problems with guarding valuable works of art in the National
Gallery have apparently not yet been solved,`` the daily said.

   Several governments quickly welcomed Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein's announcement today that he intends to
release all foreigners detained in his country and Kuwait.
   However, governments were waiting for confirmation and details
of how the release would be organized.
   ``We greatly welcome this news. We have been pressing throughout
for the return of all our hostages. The sooner they are back the
better,'' said a spokesman for the British Foreign Office.
   Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Gerry Collins said in Dublin that
he was very pleased by the report, but ``we are somewhat cautious
and will be so until such time as the news is confirmed.''
   There are nearly 1,200 Britons held in Iraq and Kuwait, and
about 250 Irish citizens.
   A spokesman at the Kuwaiti Embassy in London said, ``Let's hope
this is a prelude to him (Saddam) leaving Kuwait altogether.''
   Denmark's Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen commented:
   ``The decision underscores how crucial it has been to seek a
united solution on the detained foreigners by means of
international solidarity and efforts within the U.N. framework.''
   ``We must now hope that the coming diplomatic efforts lead to
Saddam Hussein's unconditional withdrawal of his troops out of
Kuwait,'' Ellemann-Jensen said. Sixteen Danish hostages remain in
Iraq.
   Swiss Foreign Minister Andrea Reichlin said the government was
reacting cautiously to the news. Switzerland has seven citizens
detained in Iraq.
   At the United Nations in New York, Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar was also cautiously optimistic.
   ``If all the information is confirmed, it will be a very good
development, but I always need the proper official information
about it,'' he said. But the U.N. chief said Iraq had not contacted
him about the hostages.
   In Belgium, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization termed
Saddam's call for the release of all foreign hostages ``very good
news'' but stressed Iraq must abide by all other United Nations
demands.
   ``If he (Saddam) really does what he says he is going to do, it
will be very good news,'' said a NATO official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   At the headquarters of the Gulf Support Group in London,
spokesman Andy Charles said the relatives of the hostages were
``cautiously optimistic and cautiously delighted, but we've had a
lot of similar announcemnts in the past which have not borne
fruit.''
   Some relatives, however, were more excited.
   ``I'm over the moon. It's what we've prayed and prayed for,''
said Sue Dorrington, whose husband, David, is being held in
Baghdad.
   ``I have been in tears all morning since I heard the news. I
just hope it is true,'' said Linda Grant, part of a group of 30
women related to British Airways employees who planned to go to
Baghdad this weekend.
   ``I am ... shaking like a leaf with relief and high hopes,''
said Deborah Pepper, who was also planning to go to Baghdad to seek
the release of her husband John, a British Airways employee.

   Frankie LaDel was sitting pretty
until Coco the cockatiel blew the whistle on him, authorities said.
   LaDel, 20, was arrested Tuesday on charges of breaking into a
home in this Florida Panhandle city and taking Coco, $100 in change
and $4,715 worth of camera gear, electronics equipment, jewelry,
shoes and food, police said.
   After the break-in, LaDel left Coco with the owner of Tats Are
Us Tattoo Emporium, asking him to keep the bird, which he said he
intended as a gift, until Christmas, according to a police report.
   But Coco couldn't keep his beak shut when police officer Jim
Walker stopped by the parlor Tuesday night.
   ``All of a sudden the bird started singing, and I remembered the
burglary,'' Walker said. ``He'd just been squawking and making bird
screams and then he started whistling.''
   It was the theme song from television's ``The Andy Griffith
Show.'' Walker recalled that Phillip Blankenship, Coco's owner, had
told an investigator his bird could whistle the tune from the
comedy show about a small-town sheriff.
   The tattoo parlor owner told police the bird had been brought in
by LaDel. A customer told police that LaDel could be found at a
nearby department store. LaDel was arrested in a parking lot, where
he was having car trouble, and confessed to Monday's burglary as
well as an earlier break-in at the same house, Walker said.
   The case was a first for the officer.
   ``I've never had a bird squeal on somebody,'' Walker said.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of supporters of the main
opposition to Communist power in Serbia defied a police ban
Thursday to hold a final rally in the bitter campaign for control
of Yugoslavia's largest republic.
   Opposition leader Vuk Draskovic, a candidate in Sunday's
election for the Serbian presidency, charged that a supporter of
his Serbian Renewal Movement had been shot and killed by a rival
Communist. The charge further escalated tensions in the republic.
   The crowd of 15,000 to 20,000 people chanted ``Down with Red
Bandits,'' and ``Down with Red Fascists'' after Draskovic announced
the death of Slobodan Ivanovic, 30, in the southern Serbian town of
Vranje late Wednesday.
   Sunday's election in Serbia and in the republic of Montenegro is
considered the crucial last act in a decade-long struggle for
control of Yugoslavia's future following the death in 1980 of Josip
Broz Tito, who governed with an iron hand for 35 years.
   The leaders of Yugoslavia's diverse regions have waged an
increasingly bitter battle since Tito's death, with tensions now so
high that the CIA has predicted the country may disintegrate within
18 months and civil war could break out.
   The Serbian election, the republic's first free vote in 50
years,pits the ruling hard-l in
other republics.
   Croatia, Bosnia-Hercegovina and Macedonia deeply oppose any such
expansion of the power of the Serbs, the largest of Yugoslavia's
many ethnic groups.
   In the struggle to shape the country, the Western republics of
Croatia and Slovenia, where center-right parties ousted Communists
in spring elections, want more independence from the federation.
They threaten to secede if they don't get it.
   They are pitted against Serbia and the poor southern republics
who favor a strong central government.
   As Sunday's elections approach, Draskovic and Milosevic have
been running virtually even in polls.
   Many Serbs, frustrated by Milosevic's attempts to block
political and economic reforms, apparently have turned to
center-right parties that promise Western-oriented changes.
   Milosevic repeatedly has refused to negotiate with Croatia and
Slovenia on the country's future.
   Draskovic, on the other hand, has said he would ``negotiate with
the devil'' if it benefits Serbia.
   Milosevic and Draskovic face 30 lesser rivals running for
Serbia's president. Also at stake are 250 seats in the republic's
Parliament, which will be contested by 53 parties. In districts
where there is no clear winner, runoff elections will be held on
Dec. 23.

   A 3-year-old boy whose nursery school teacher
found a loaded gun sticking out his jacket told police he took the
gun to school to show his friends.
   Isolyn Hong, an aide at the College Community Child Care Center
in the borough of Brooklyn, said she noticed the butt of the gun
sticking out of the boy's jacket Wednesday. School officials
thought the gun might be a toy but called police anyway.
   Officers confirmed it was a Raven .25-caliber automatic. It had
one round of ammunition in the chamber and three rounds in the
clip.
   ``It was an upsetting situation, yet we are thankful we were
able to discover the gun and no one got hurt,'' said Gail Dubins, a
teacher at the College Community Child Care Center. ``There were no
tears to be shed.''
   ``It makes you open your eyes,'' she said today. ``Everybody has
to be aware with children; you can't take anything for granted. It
was a scary experience.''
   The child, who was not identified beccause of his age, was
placed in city custody and the owner of the gun was arrested, said
Sgt. Grace Ridley, a police spokeswoman.
   Police Wednesday charged Lloyd Flowers of the borough of
Brooklyn with criminal possession of a weapon and endangering the
life of a child.
   Flowers, 27, a friend of the child's family, drove the boy to
school Wednesday, Ridley said. The child told police he took the
gun off the front seat of Flowers' van.
   Ridley said the Department of Child Welfare Services will decide
if the child will be returned to his parents.
   Other children have been found with loaded weapons at school,
but the 3-year-old was believed to be the youngest in the city's
history.
   In January 1989, a 5-year-old kindergarten student in the Bronx
took a loaded handgun into his school cafeteria and a 6-year-old
took a .25-caliber gun to his class for show and tell.

<NOTE>EDs: Top 6 grafs new with Bush rejecting linkage to Palestinian
issue. Editing throughout.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration today renewed its
opposition to a Mideast Peace conference as the idea surfaced anew
in the United Nations. President Bush said there is ``no linkage''
between an Iraqi pullout from Kuwait and Israeli withdrawal from
Palestinian territories.
   The United States will not give Saddam Hussein ``some
face-saving way out of something he shouldn't have gotten into in
the first place,'' Bush told a news conference in Santiago, Chile.
   ``The question is the aggression against Kuwait. There will be
and is no linkage to the Palestinian or the West Bank question,''
he said.
   With backing from the Palestine Liberation Organization and Arab
governments, a group of neutral nations has been trying to persuade
the U.N. Security Council to approve a resolution calling for a
peace conference that would discuss Israel's occupation of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The United States has sought in the past to resolve Palestinian
demands for national rights and to end Israel's occupation of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, captured in the 1967 Mideast war, Bush
said. ``And we continue to be very interested'' in moving forward
the search for a solution, he added.
   But, he said, Saddam has tried from the start to justify his
invasion of Kuwait by saying it would lead to a solution for the
Palestinians.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III told the House Foreign
Affairs Committee that U.S. policy on te question of an
international conference has not changed.
   ``We've taken the position for a long time that an international
conference, properly structured, at an appropriate time, might be
useful. That has been the policy of the United States for a long
time. We are not now recommending that an international conference
on the Arab-Israeli conflict be held,'' Baker said.
   He added: ``Nor are we supporting a resolution in the Security
Council that would seek to convene such a conference. Precisely
because of our consistent position that we will not link the gulf
crisis and the Arab-Israeli dispute, this is certainly not an
appropriate time for an international conference.''
   Diplomatic sources said U.S. diplomats in New York were trying
at this point to modify the proposed text to make the call for a
peace conference more a long-range goal than an immediate demand.
   ``We are against an international conference,'' said Avi Pazner,
spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. ``We favor
face-to-face negotiations with the Arabs. Peace with Egypt did not
come as a result of an international conference. We hope there will
be no such resolution.''
   Pazner was in Washington preparing for a visit next week by
Shamir. The prime minister will meet with President Bush, Vice
President Dan Quayle, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, Secretary
of State James A. Baker III and key members of Congress.
   As the Bush administration seeks to maintain Arab support
against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, supporters of the
Palestinians have seized the occasion to promote a peace conference
and other measures designed to force concessions from Israel.
   Although Bush and Baker have said they would not link their
campaign to force Iraq out of Kuwait with the Palestinian issue,
Baker said last week the problem must be addressed. He also said he
had made no commitments in exchange for support of the resolution
approved by the Security Council last Thursday to authorize force
if Iraq does not withdraw its troops voluntarily by Jan. 15.
   Shamir intends to stand by his proposal that Palestinians on the
West Bank and Gaza vote to choose leaders who would negotiate with
Israel five years of limited self-rule, Pazner said.
   It was approved by the Bush administration earlier this year.
But when Baker added provisions to permit Palestinians expelled
from the territories to participate in the negotiations, the
Israeli Cabinet refused to go along.
   Pazner said Shamir's visit to Washington was initiated by the
president. The Israeli spokesman described relations between the
two countries as good.
   Bush and Baker have excluded Israel from the diverse coalition
they organized in an attempt to force Iraq out of Kuwait. Pazner
said Israel has no objections to that arrangement.
 part of the decision-making process and our policy
is very clear - we want to stay out of it,'' he said.

   Amid a spate of bombing incidents carried
out by leftist guerrillas, President Bush arrived here today and
hailed Chile's ``democratic renaissance'' and pro-growth economic
policies.
   The bombings apparently were designed to dramatize guerrilla
opposition to Bush's call for conservative economic policies
throughout the hemisphere. No injuries were reported.
   Bush, at a news conference after talks with President Patricio
Aylwin, also pledged to go ``as far as we can'' to bring the
killers of Orlando Letelier to justice, and sought to deflect anger
over last year's ban on Chilean grapes in a poison scare.
   Bush said his Enterprise for the Americas initiative to spur
trade with the continent ``is not going to be an empty slogan'' and
will not be thwarted by his own bureaucracy.
   Here as elsewhere in Bush's week-long goodwill tour of South
America, the latest news from Iraq stole the headlines.
   Bush learned aboard Air Force One on his flight here from Buenos
Aires of Saddam Hussein's change of heart on holding foreign
hostages.
   Bush said he hoped it was true, but ``no single hostage should
have been taken in the first place.'' He said Hussein ``needs to
get out of Kuwait without trying to complicate this matter'' with
his call for a Middle East peace conference.
   Before Bush arrived, leftist guerillas exploded a half-dozen
bombs overnight at sites with U.S. ties, including four Mormon
chapels, a new McDonald's restaurant and a downtown park outside a
hotel where some officials in Bush's advance party were staying.
Police reported no injuries.
   One dissident scored a bull's eye with an egg on Bush's
limousine, splattering it over the door next to the presidential
seal. Most of the crowds that lined Santiago's streets were
friendly, however.
   Bush and Aylwin faced the press in the small garden outside the
president's private home before Bush flew by helicopter to the
Pacific port city of Valparaiso to address Chile's Congress in its
new home.
   At the red-carpet welcome for Air Force One at the airport,
Aylwin said, ``Mr. President, we welcome you with joy.''
   ``We value your presence in our land. We share common ideals,''
said Aylwin, elected last December as Chile restored democracy
after the 17-year military rule of Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
   ``No where among the nations of this continent has the pace of
free market reform gone farther, faster than right here in Chile,''
Bush said.
   ``Chile's return to the ranks of the world's democracies is
cause for pride and celebration,'' he said.
   Bush said, ``These past few days from Brasilia to Montevideo to
Buenos Aires, I have witnessed first hand the irresistible power of
the democratic ideal. Around the world, across the Americas, a
democratic renaissance is under way.''
   Letelier, a former Chilean foreign minister and staunch foe of
strongman Gen. Augusto Pinochet, was killed by a bomb on a
Washington street in 1976, along with an American associate Ronnie
Moffitt.
   A U.S. court indicted three Chilean army officers and secret
police members, but the Chilean Supreme Court blocked extradition.
Aylwin has promised to reopen the case with a special civilian
prosecutor and to compensate the families.
   Bush said, ``I think the president (Aylwin) has moved ...to get
that contentious matter cleared up. ... As far as we can, we want
to cooperate fully.''
   Aylwin promised that ``a full clarification of truth and
justice'' will be made.
   On the grape embargo, imposed after Food and Drug Administration
inspectors reportedly found two grapes laced with cyanide in the
hold of a ship in Philadelphia, Chilean growers are demanding
compensation for losses estimated at $330 million.
   Bush said he planned to ``discuss this very sensitive question''
later with Aylwin, but asked for understanding.
   Citing the deaths of several people who ingested poisoned
Tylenol in the early 1980s, Bush said, ``It isn't the Chilean grape
that was singled out. This is the way in the United States we
approach matters that can adversely affect the health of our
people.''
   Bush arrived at a time when U.S. economic and military ties have
been restored to normalcy with the removal of sanctions imposed
during the years of military rule.
   On Wednesday police used tear gas and water cannons to scatter
400 demonstrators marching through the streets and chanting
anti-Bush slogans.
   The Bush administration prefaced the visit by lifting sanctions
imposed during the dictatorship of Pinochet.
   In late November, Washington allowed Chile back into the General
Preferences System, which grants tariff concessions to exports from
various countries.
   Finance Minister Alejandro Foxley said that should allow Chile
to increase exports to the United States by around $100 million
from the present $1.45 billion a year.
   The Reagan administration excluded Chile from the system in 1988
to protest Pinochet's repression of the Chilean labor movement.
   Last weekend, the administration lifted a ban on military aid
and the sale of military equipment imposed in 1976 following the
Letelier and Moffitt murders.
   According to protocol, the 75-year-old Pinochet, who is still
army commander, should attend several ceremonies with Bush.
   But Pinochet has long accused the United States of interfering
in Chilean affairs. When King Juan Carlos of Spain, another strong
supporter of democratic changes, visited Chile in October, Pinochet
snubbed him by leaving Santiago for what were officially described
as military activities.

<TEXT>
   The Rev. Francisco Oves Fernandez, the
retired Roman Catholic archbishiop of Havana, Cuba, died of an
apparent heart attack. He was 62.
   Oves was among hundreds of priests driven from Cuba in the early
1960s as Communists led by Fidel Castro consolidated power.
   At the time of his death Tuesday, Oves was pastor of Santo Nino
de Atocha Catholic Church in El Paso.
   ``He was a man who suffered a lot in his life, particularly
after he went back to Cuba,'' said Irma Cordova, who heads a youth
group at Santo Nino de Atocha.
   Oves was allowed to return to Cuba in the late 1960s, and in
1969 was ordained auxiliary bishop of Cienfuegos, Cuba.
   Oves was named archbishop of Havana - the capital of a nation
that was officially atheist - in 1970 by Pope Paul VI.
   Oves generally avoided conflict with the government. He retired
as archbishop in 1982 and came to El Paso at the request of the
Vatican, said the Rev. Edward Roden-Lucero, spokesman for the El
Paso Catholic Diocese.
   A funeral Mass was held Thursday.
   He is survived by two brothers and two sisters.

   President Hussain Muhammad Ershad
resigned Thursday after ruling the country for eight years, handing
power to an interim leader chosen by the opposition.
   Ershad, a former army general who took power in a 1982 coup, had
faced seven weeks of often violent nationwide protests against his
government. On Tuesday, he promised to step down as soon as a
replacement was named.
   Earlier Thursday, Ershad lifted the state of emergency in effect
since Nov. 27.
   Later, he administered the oath of office to Shahabuddin Ahmed,
a political independent nominated by the country's opposition
parties as caretaker vice-president. Then he signed a letter of
resignation, making him acting president.
   ``Allah bless you,'' he told Shahabuddin after the 15-minute
ceremony in the president's office. ``You have our blessings. I
want peace to return to society.''
   Originally, Shahabuddin's nomination was to be approved by
Parliament on Saturday, but Ershad unexpectedly dissolved the
lawmaking body early Thursday.
   Constitutional experts and opposition sources said it had been
doubtful that a majority of legislators would emerge in public for
a vote. Two-thirds of Parliament belonged to Ershad's Jatiya Party,
and many were reluctant to appear in public for fear of being
attacked by anti-Ershad activists.
   Shahabuddin, 62, chief justice of the Supreme Court, will
supervise elections to Parliament, which must be re-constituted
within 90 days. The new body will decide whether to retain power or
hold presidential elections.
   ``I have no political ambition. I shall not stay here beyond the
mandated 90 days,'' said Shahbuddin, 62, after he was sworn in.
``During this period, I shall try to ensure peace and stability,
hold free and fair elections and hand over power to the elected
representatives of the people.''
   Reporters who attended the transfer of power ceremony said
Ershad's eyes were filled with tears as he bade farewell to chiefs
of the country's army, navy and air force and his personal staff.
   Army chief Lt. Gen. Nooruddin Khan played a pivotal role in
persuading Ershad to resign, according to well-placed sources. He
acted as a middleman between the president and the opposition after
junior army officers advised Khan they would not support a man
opposed by the people, the sources said.
   After Thursday's ceremony, Ershad and Khan shook hands and
embraced. Ershad then left for his home.
   Ershad was the army chief when he took power in a bloodless coup
eight years ago. He resigned from the army after winning
presidential elections in 1986, which the opposition claimed were
rigged.
   Charges of vote fraud also dogged the 1986 and 1988 elections to
parliament, which were won by Ershad's Jatiya or People's Party.
The opposition made vote fraud the pivotal point of their protest
campaign when Ershad announced his candidacy for the June 1991
presidential poll.
   Ershad's resignation capped a dizzying reversal of his political
fortunes. Three weeks ago, he was confidently predicting success in
next year's presidential elections.
   The opposition campaign to oust him had long been little more
than an irritation during his rule of this impoverished nation of
107 million people.
   But it gained new impetus with the end of longstanding political
differences between Sheik Hasina and Khaleda Zia, the opposition
leaders. Its growth continued even after Ershad declared the state
of emergency in late November and called out the army to quell
street protests.
   Hundreds of doctors, professors, merchant seamen, civil servants
and some Jatiya Party members of Parliament resigned to back the
opposition call. On Monday, Ershad offered to resign 45 days before
the next presidential polls. The opposition rejected the offer and
intensified its protest campaign.
   Then, on Tuesday night, Ershad promised to resign immediately.
   One of his last acts before resigning was to withdraw the state
of emergency and restore civil rights. The opposition claims that
at least 100 people were killed by government troops during the
emergency. Ershad's administration said only six people had died.
   The choice of Shahabuddin to head the interim government was
made by Ms. Hasina and Mrs. Zia.
   Ms. Hasina, leader of the left-of-center Awami League, is the
daughter of Sheik Mujibur Rahman, Bangladesh's first president.
   Mrs. Zia, head of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, is the widow
of another former president, Ziaur Rahman. Both men were
assassinated.
   Ershad is the country's ninth president since it gained
independence from Pakistan in 1971. All were installed by military
action.

<HEAD>Outgoing Soviet Spokesman Cited by U.S. Communicators' Group</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Gennady I. Gerasimov, whose statements of
``new thinking'' in Soviet foreign policy made him a familiar
figure on the world stage, has been named ``communicator of the
year'' by a group of American public affairs officials.
   Gerasimov, chief spokesman for the Soviet Foreign Ministry, lost
much of his visibility earlier this year when President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev named his own presidential spokesman.
   The 60-year-old former Soviet journalist has been replaced by
Vitaly Churkin, an aide to Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   Gerasimov is expected to be named ambassador to Portugal.
   The National Association of Government Communicators, whose
members include public affairs employees of federal, state and
local governments in the United States, will present its annual
award Friday.
   The group's announcement said the selection of Gerasimov marks
the first time the organization has selected a foreign
communicator.
   ``It would have been unthinkable to consider a Soviet official
as recipient of this award just a few short years ago,'' the
announcement said.
   Previous winners have been one-time State Department spokesman
Bernard Kalb, former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop and Voice
of America Beijing correspondent Al Pessin, who covered the 1989
crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square.
   As the Kremlin emerged from its hostile, secretive stance in the
latter 1980s, Gerasimov rose to prominence as a spokesman for the
new leadership. His frequent press briefings, fluent English and
acerbic wit made him an oft-cited source in news stories about
developments in the Soviet Union.
   He was criticized, however, for his inability to manage the
exploding public affairs operation of the Soviet government as
Gorbachev captured the world stage.

<HEAD>Zoo Loses Rhinoceros in Attempt To Trim Her Horn</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY FOSTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lewis Greene, flecks of blood clinging to his
glasses, still looked a little dazed as he watched workers hose
down the rhinoceros house at the Audubon Zoo.
   Greene had just lost - if not a loved one - a longtime
companion. Jessie, a 32-year-old African white rhinoceros, died as
veterinarians removed part of her horn in hopes the operation would
enable them to breed her before she was too old.
   ``Both of our males have very small horns and both females have
large horns. We think that prevented them from mating. The females
with larger horns would spar with the males and were able to keep
them away,'' said Greene, the zoo keeper in charge of rhinos.
   ``Other zoos that have had the problem have had good luck
reducing the female's horn,'' Greene said. ``Putting them on equal
footing, so to speak.''
   Because rhinoceroses in the wild are disappearing, zoos are
trying to breed those they have in accordance with an international
species survival plan.
   All of the five surviving species are endangered because of
habitat destruction and illegal hunting, especially for their
horns, said Curt Burnette, Audubon's general curator.
   The horns, made of matted hair, are considered an aphrodisiac in
the Far East, where they sell for as much as $18,000 a pound.
   ``Their situation in the wild is from bad to critical,''
Burnette said. ``Of the five species, the white is the most
plentiful. There are probably several thousand of them. The
Sumatran rhino probably numbers in the dozens. In 10 years I doubt
there will be any rhinos existing in the wild.''
   Jessie's biological clock was ticking away and officials hoped
to breed her before it was too late. Since the four rhinoceroses at
Audubon were all caught in the wild, adding their genes to the
genetic pool of captured rhinos would improve the long-term chances
of the species surviving, Greene said.
   ``Short term there will be rhinos in zoos, but long-term their
survival, even there could be in jeopardy. If only 20 percent of
the captive rhinos breed, as the years go by, there'll be fewer and
fewer that can reproduce,'' Greene said.
   The operation to reduce Jessie's horn was considered safe,
Burnette said. The animal had been anesthetized previously without
difficulty, he said.
   ``It was low risk and we were willing to take a small risk
because we have to,'' Burnette said. ``Her genes weren't crucial,
but they were important. Since she was captured in the wild ... the
offspring would be new to the captive breeding stock.''
   After the horn was trimmed, the four veterinarians were doing
some blood tests and an ultrasound test on the animal's
reproductive organs when she stopped breathing, Burnette said.
   A 12-hour necropsy was done to determine what caused the rhino
to die. Burnette said it might take weeks before results were
known.
   Jessie still might contribute to the overall genetic pool,
Burnette said. Veterinarians harvested unfertilized eggs, which
will be frozen in hopes of fertilizing them and implanting them in
another rhinoceros.
   ``That's just a hope at this time,'' Burnette said. ``The
technique hasn't been perfected. It's kind of like having your body
frozen when you die and hope they'll be able to bring you back
later. But, when something is so close to disappearing, you take
every chance you can to prevent that.''

   Pop diva Madonna was ordered by a judge
Thursday to trim a hedge and pine tree at her Hollywood Hills home.
   Superior Court Judge Sally Disco ruled Madonna violated an
agreement with neighbor Donald Robinson requiring her to keep her
shrubbery trimmed so it wouldn't interfere with his view.
   The judge rejected Robinson's claim of $1 million damages for
the loss of his view, but she ordered Madonna to pay Robinson's
attorney fees.
   Liz Rosenberg, publicist for the singer, was out of the office
Thursday and couldn't be reached, a receptionist said. Madonna's
lawyer, Meghan Serwin, and Robinson's attorney, Robert Rigdon, were
not in their offices Thursday for comment.
   Madonna said in a deposition she bought the house above the
Sunset Strip because of its spectacular view and privacy. But after
she moved in, she said she noticed gardeners peering through her
hedges.
   Disco ruled there was insufficient evidence to support Madonna's
cross-claim against Robinson that said he had harmed her by
infringing on her privacy.

   SEVIERVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - Dolly Parton's younger sister has
filed a worker's compensation lawsuit against the theme park the
entertainer owns.
   Freida Parton, 33, said she injured her back closing a dressing
room door at Dollywood, in the foothills of the Smoky Mountains.
   In the lawsuit filed this week in Sevier County Chancery Court,
Freida Parton says she sustained the injury on June 10, 1989, and
underwent back surgery.
   She seeks unspecified benefits under the state's worker's
compensation act.
   Barbara Headla, marketing manager at Dollywood, did not return a
telephone message left at the park.
   Freida Parton and her twin brother, Floyd, are the
next-to-youngest of the 12 Parton siblings.
   Dolly Parton opened Dollywood in 1985. She co-starred in ``Steel
Magnolias'' last year and was host of 1987's short-lived variety
television series ``Dolly.''

   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) - Former congresswoman Barbara Jordan has
agreed to serve as special counsel on ethics for Gov.-elect Ann
Richards.
   ``Barbara Jordan is recognized throughout the country as one of
the most important voices in ethics and government that one could
possibly have,'' Richards said Wednesday.
   In 1966, Jordan became the state's first black state senator. In
1972, she was the first black elected to Congress from the South
since Reconstruction.
   Once considered a possible Democratic vice presidential
candidate, Jordan ended her political career after three terms in
the House. She became a professor at the Lyndon B. Johnson School
of Public Affairs at the University of Texss.
   Richards said Jordan would counsel members of her administration
on ethical conduct and help draft legislation on ethics.
   Bill Cryer, Richards' press secretary, said Jordan was taking
the post on ``an unpaid, voluntary basis'' and would continue
teaching.

   LONDON (AP) - Dame Joan Sutherland is coming out of retirement
after just two months, but for only one performance: a New Year's
Eve farewell to Covent Garden, the Royal Opera House said Thursday.
   Sutherland, the coloratura soprano with amazing voice range,
will be joined by Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti and U.S.
mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne.
   ``Although Dame Joan has retired, she wants to make this one -
and only one - exception, to come to London to say goodbye to
Covent Garden where she began her opera career in 1952,'' said
Kathleen Wilkinson, the Royal Opera spokeswoman.
   Sutherland, 64, will play the ``star guest'' at Prince
Orlofsky's party in Act II of ``Die Fledermaus'' by Johann Strauss.
The opera will be conducted by her husband, Richard Bonynge and
will be televised live by the British Broadcasting Corp.
   Pavarotti and Horne will appear as fellow party guests.
   Sutherland, known as ``La Stupenda'' (the magnificent one),
retired Oct. 2 with a performance in her hometown of Sydney,
Australia.
   In October, Sutherland withdrew from performances at Covent
Garden, saying she wanted people to remember her voice in its
prime.

   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Beach Boys' reclusive founder Brian Wilson
made a private concert appearance before a group that included
political cartoonist Garry Trudeau as the two joined in an AIDS
fund-raising effort.
   Looking uncomfortable in a dark suit and tie, a nervous Wilson
played piano and sang Wednesday at the private reception. A few
dozen patrons paid at least $125 each for the 15-minute
performance.
   ``I enjoyed it,'' Wilson said after the performance. ``I had to
close my eyes. That's the only way I can really feel my music,
closing my eyes.''
   Wilson had said before the show that he was ``scared to death.''
   Trudeau, creator of the comic strip ``Doonesbury,'' sat
cross-legged on the floor during the concert.
   Among other tunes, Wilson played selections from the Beach Boys'
1966 ``Pet Sounds'' album, which recently came out on compact disc.
Andy Lippincott, a character in ``Doonesbury'' who died from AIDS,
had looked forward to the disc's release.
   Before the reception, Wilson and Trudeau attended the opening of
an art galley with 59 original drawings of editions of the comic
strip that dealt with Lippincott's death.
   The drawings are being sold to raise money for the NAMES
Project, which is coordinating the construction of a huge memorial
quilt dedicated to AIDS victims.

   Potential jurors in Elizabeth Taylor's legal
battle with an ex-boyfriend over dollars and scents were asked
about alcoholism, AIDS and what type of perfume they wear.
   Miss Taylor's former beau, Henry Wynberg, is suing the actress
for a share of the profits from her perfume, Passion, claiming she
breached a contract with him to market the fragrance.
   During jury selection Wednesday in Superior Court, two potential
jurors disclosed they splash on Passion but said it wouldn't affect
their objectivity.
   Today, two potential jurors said they had never seen the Academy
Award-winning actress on film; a third said he had seen most of her
films, since he had been going to movies since the silent film era.
Miss Taylor reacted with a mock expression of horror, then laughed
along with others in the courtroom.
   Wynberg, a former used-car salesman who courted Miss Taylor
between her two marriages to Richard Burton, claims he created the
fragrance.
   Miss Taylor signed a contract with Wynberg in 1975 but in 1986
struck a deal instead with Chesebrough-Ponds Inc., the company that
ultimately launched Passion.
   Wynberg then sued for 72 percent of the some $70 million a year
Passion generates in profit. He also argued that her alcoholism and
weight gain destroyed the glamorous image he counted on to market
the cosmetics.
   Miss Taylor contended that Wynberg's criminal record led her to
abandon their business deal, and on Wednesday she won permission
from Judge Coleman Swart to tell jurors about her former
boyfriend's criminal past.
   Wynberg's attorneys had tried to bar, as irrelevant and
prejudicial, evidence that he once pleaded guilty to statutory
rape, providing drugs to underage girls in return for sex and
taking pornographic photos of girls.
   Miss Taylor's attorney, Neil Papapiano, asked the 50 prospective
jurors whether they knew alcoholics and had any views about
rehabilitation programs. Most said they knew alcoholics and
approved of efforts to help them.
   ``It has been fairly well publicized that Miss Taylor at one
time had an alcohol abuse problem and went to the Betty Ford Clinic
and since that time has had no problem,'' Papiano said.
   The lawyer also also asked potential jurors if they knew about
Miss Taylor's work for AIDS research and how they felt about it. He
said a percentage of her perfume profits go toward AIDS research.

   Barbara Bush brought some holiday cheer to
Children's Hospital on Thursday and shared with the youngsters her
fondest wish for a Christmas gift: ``Peace.''
   ``We just started decorating the White House today,'' said Mrs.
Bush. ``And now I've come here and I feel like Christmas has really
started.''
   It was Mrs. Bush's second Christmas visit to the Children's
National Medical Center. Former First Lady Nancy Reagan visited
every year during her eight years at the White House.
   The children vied for seats next to Mrs. Bush while the Peace
Piper madrigal singers from Chopticon High School of Maryland
regaled them with songs ranging from Elizabethan Christmas carols
to The Reindeer Rap - ``Without us, Santa ain't nothin'.''
   Gifts were presented to Mrs. Bush by two of the hospital's
patients, Lorin Gerhardt, 9, of Waldorf, Md., and Jason Webster, of
LaPlata, Md., 11.
   ``Just what I wanted,'' cried Mrs. Bush as she unwrapped a
ribbon-bedecked rawhide dog bone.
   ``You were supposed to tell her it was for Millie,'' said the
hospital's president Donald Brown, referring to the First Family's
springer spaniel.
   The children also give her a teddy bear ornament for the White
House Christmas tree and introduced her to the hospital's mascot,
Ted E. Bear.
   Before joining the festivities in the hospital lobby, Mrs. Bush
read ``The Wild Christmas Reindeer'' by Jan Brett to a group of
young patients. The storytelling was taped for NBC-TV's special
``Christmas in Washington'' and will be aired on Dec. 19 at 10:00
p.m. EST.
   The First Lady chatted easily with the children who clamored to
be picked up and held.
   ``My friend just asked me how old I was,'' she said, pointing to
10-year old Ryan Cotnoir of Fairfax, Va. ``I told him I was 65 ...
and I told him George Bush was 66. `You're almost twins,' he
said!''
   Lorin said she was chosen to present the gifts to Mrs. Bushbecause
she'd ``been around a long time.'' Lorin has been receiving
treatment at Children's Hospital for cystic fibrosis since she was
five weeks old.
   ``I like Mrs. Bush because she comes here not just because
people ask her to, but because she really cares,'' said Lorin.
   And what did the First Lady want Santa to bring her? ``Peace,''
she said as she waved good-bye to the children.

<HEAD>Bush Embraces Hostage Release, Warns Iraq to Leave Kuwait</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Inserts grafs 3-4, The State Department, on preparations for
evacuation.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   President Bush today welcomed Saddam
Hussein's dramatic promise to free American and other hostages but
insisted ``the man must leave Kuwait without reservation, without
condition'' before the Gulf crisis can end.
   In Washington, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said the
United States had received official notification in Baghdad that
the hostages - 900 Americans among them - would be set free. It was
unclear when.
   The State Department, in a message for broadcast by the Voice of
America, advised U.S. citizens in Iraq and Kuwait it was making
preparations for their evacuation as soon as they are permitted to
leave.
   ``Until that time, stay where you are, stay in touch with the
U.S. embassy, and monitor the VOA closely,'' it said. ``We will let
you know as soon as we have more information.''
   Bush stressed that no deal with Saddam was in the works - or
would be considered.
   ``There are no secret negotiations, direct or indirect with Iraq
over this question,'' Bush said. ``None. And there will be none.''
   He said he hoped the Iraqi decision to release the hostages from
Kuwait was ``credible,'' and stressed, ``no single hostage should
have been taken in the first place.''
   Iraq invaded and occupied Kuwait on Aug. 2, triggering a crisis
that involved a sequence of hostage-taking and partial releases.
The Americans, and thousands others, continue to be held as part of
Saddam's effort to use hostages as human shields against a possible
attack.
   Saddam was quoted today as saying that diplomatic and military
developments made the hostages unnecessary.
   Bush is in Chile as part of a five-nation swing through Latin
America, but his attention was forced back to the Gulf crisis with
word of Saddam's initiative.
   ``We are not going to get diverted from the full implementation
of the United Nations resolutions in order to give him some face
saving way out of something he shouldn't have gotten into in the
first place,'' Bush said, again rejecting Saddam's calls to link
resolution of the current crisis with the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   ``He doesn't need any face - he needs to get out of Kuwait
without trying to complicate this matter. ... It is clear what his
ploy is and that ploy is not going to be successful.''
   Iraq on Wednesday accepted Bush's offer to send Baker to Baghdad
for a face-to-face meeting with Saddam. In his testimony, Baker
also rejected Iraqi demands that the talks include discussion of
other Mideast crises.
   ``I will not be negotiating the Palestinian question or the
civil war in Lebanon,'' Baker said.
   Bush made that point as well, saying: ``There will be and is no
linkage.'' Nor, Bush said, would there be any concessions to Iraq.
   Of the hostage development, he said: ``This would be welcome if
true but it will not change my thinking on his need to comply, 100
percent, without conditions, to the U.N. resolutions.''
   ``I hope it shows that the strategy is working and that Saddam
understands that his hostage policy has incurred the condemnation
of the whole world,'' Bush said.
   He tempered his praise for the announcement with harsh criticism
of Saddam's hostage taking. Like Baker, he said the promised
release of hostages was far short of what needed to be done to end
the crisis.
   ``We've got to continue to keep the pressure on,'' Bush said.
``The release of all hostages would be a very good thing but the
problem is the aggression against Kuwait and the man must leave
Kuwait without reservation, without condition.''
   On Capitol Hill, Baker embraced the announcement from Baghdad
but said nothing short of a complete withdrawal from Kuwait and
restoration of its government would end the 4-month-old standoff.
   ``This is a welcome and significant development, but we do want
to see it actually happen,'' Baker told the House Foreign Affairs
Committee. ``...It seems to me no coincidence that this comes just
one week, just one week, after the international community has
authorized the use of force.''
   The initial administration reaction to the hostage announcement
came from spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, who said, ``If it's true
we'll do what is necessary to get our people out.''
   Baker said anew that Bush hopes for a peaceful solution and has
not decided whether to use force immediately should Saddam ignore a
United Nations resolution demanding that Iraq withdraw from Kuwait
by Jan. 15.
   But he gave yet another pessimistic administration account on
the impact sanctions have had against Iraq over the past four
months and said waiting too long was not in the United States
interest.
   ``At some point delay carries a very high price for all of us,''
said Baker, including higher casualties among the U.S.-led forces
in the event of war should Iraq be given much more time to fortify
its positions in Kuwait.
   ``He has to be stopped, peacefully if possible, but if necessary
by force,'' Baker said. ``A willingness to use force against Iraq
remains essential.''
   Baker was following Defense Secretary Richard Cheney and Gen.
Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in a weeklong
administration effort to silence congressional critics of Bush's
gulf policy.
   ``Let the United States speak with one voice,'' Baker said
during one of several animated exchanges with lawmakers.
   Baker's won support from one liberal Democrat on the panel, Rep.
Stephen Solarz of New York, who said it must be made clear that
``unless he withdraws a war will be inevitable and unless he
withdraws he and his military machine will be destroyed.''
   Baker is to go to Baghdad after Tariq Aziz, the Iraqi foreign
minister, comes to Washington for talks with Bush.

payments, the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   Keith Bjerke, executive vice president of the department's
Commodity Credit Corp., said the subsidies would be paid by county
offices of the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service.
   The payments are due farmers when market prices in a specified

   Nearly all the payments, expected to begin next week, will go to
wheat farmers. Barley producers will get about $35 million and oats
producers about $8 million.

   The families of about 900 American hostages held in Kuwait and
Iraq awoke today to the promise of an end to the frustration and
fear that have haunted them since Saddam Hussein sparked the
Persian Gulf crisis four months ago.
   ``There were times I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep,'' said
Doris Whatley of Shreveport, La. ``All of a sudden I am a changed
person ... because my husband is coming home.''
   Mrs. Whatley's husband is an oil worker among about 90 of the
Americans who are being used as ``human shields'' at strategic
sites. He called from Baghdad this morning to share in his wife's
elation. But for the friends and relatives of other hostages it was
a time of restraint.
   ``We'll celebrate when we see them coming out and not before. At
my age, you learn to have a little equanimity about these things,''
said Margaret Williams, whose son and daughter-in-law were working
in Kuwait when Saddam's troops invaded Aug. 2.
   The couple's daughter, Jennifer Williams, was among a group of
about 20 Americans who, against State Department recommendations,
traveled this week to Baghdad to seek their loved ones' release.
   ``You can't give up hope - there's always hope,'' Mrs. Williams
said this morning from her home in Germantown, Tenn. ``But this
could well be just another one of (Saddam's) cat-and-mouse games.''
   Saddam called for the release of all foreign hostages in a
directive to the Iraqi parliament, a decision he said was prompted
by recent diplomatic moves that may include President Bush's
proposal for direct U.S.-Iraqi talks.
   The directive, which did not say when the captives would be
freed, followed Saddam's previous offer to release all hostages
over a three-month period beginning Christmas Day, ``if nothing
mars the atmosphere of peae.''
   ``So far we've heard a lot of rhetoric, double-talk and
half-truths,'' said David McDonald Jr., whose old friend and client
is among the Americans who have been hiding in Kuwait. ``But this
seems like the first serious break.''
   Bonnie Anderton of Larkspur, Colo., whose husband has been holed
up at the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait, agreed Saddam's directive was a
potential turning point in the Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``But (Saddam) has a habit of putting real nasty catches on
things,'' said Mrs. Anderton, who was among the wives and children
released several weeks after the invasion occurred. ``It looks
good, but we still need more details.''
   Still, families could not help but cheer the long-awaited
early-morning news. Around the country, relatives stayed home from
work to follow the story and celebrate the first glimmer of hope
they'd seen in weeks.
   ``It's an answer to our prayers. We have been praying him home
for Christmas ... and it looks like our answer is coming,'' said
Rande Vallekoop, whose husband has been stranded at the U.S.
Embassy in Baghdad.
   ``I feel freed too ... but none of us are ever going to be the
same,'' she said this morning from Minneapolis. ``There will be
emotional and mental stuff in becoming a family again.
   ``I'm sure it will take some time,'' Mrs. Vallekoop said. ``But
I don't mind that at all. Not one bit.''

   A senior Energy Department official accused
Japan on Thursday of hoarding crude oil in the months after Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait, despite agreement among most consuming nations
to draw down stockpiles and ease supply problems.
   Linda Stuntz, an Energy Department deputy under secretary for
policy and planning, said she expects the issue to be raised next
week at a meeting of the governing board of the International
Energy Agency.
   The Paris-based agency is responsible for coordinating responses
by oil consuming nations in an oil supply emergency.
   ``If everybody in the world did what Japan is doing we would
have a much more serious problem than we do. Prices would be a lot
higher,'' said Ms. Stuntz in remarks to a group of reporters.
   She later said in an interview that she did not want to
overstate the concern, but added that Japan's actions raise
questions about the success of future cooperative activities among
consuming nations in response to oil supply shocks.
   Ms. Stuntz said that in the months after the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait last August, U.S. oil companies and most companies in Europe
drew down crude oil stocks in order to keep supplies adequate
without having to dramatically increase imports.
   But, she said, the Japanese, rather than drawing down crude oil
stocks after the loss of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil, elected instead to
continue importing at high levels and, in fact, increased imports
to meet additional demand.
   ``That is stockpiling,'' she said, something the United States
and other consuming nation's had sought to prevent to ease the
immediate shock of losing 4.3 million barrels of oil a day as a
result of the Iraq-Kuwait crisis.
   Ms. Stuntz said that despite increasing consumer demand, U.S.
imports were 12 percent lower in September and 25 percent lower in
October than they were last July, before the Iraqi invasion,
because U.S. refineries were relying on existing stocks.
   In October, Japan imported 33 percent more oil than it did in
July, she said.
   ``What does this mean for future cooperative activities?'' she
asked.

   Peanut farmers will vote in a mail referendum
Dec. 10-13 on whether to continue government controls and price
supports for five years, the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   If two-thirds or more vote in favor of poundage quotas, no
referendum will be held in the second, third, fourth and fifth
year, and the federal program will remain in effect for crops in
1991 through 1995.
   But if the vote falls short of the two-thirds margin, the quotas
and price supports won't be in effect for the 1991 peanut crop.
However, another referendum would be held next year to determine
whether the program would be in effect for the 1992 through 1995
crops.
   In a 1986 referendum, more than 97 percent of the 21,456 peanut
growers who cast ballots voted in favor of the program for 1986
through 1990, officials said.

   President Bush on Thursday welcomed
Iraq's surprise promise to free all foreign hostages but said the
United States must not relax its war footing in the Persian Gulf.
``We've got to continue to keep the pressure on,'' he said.
   Iraq officially notified the United States that all 900
Americans held in Iraq and Kuwait would be released, Secretary of
State James A. Baker III disclosed in Washington. It was unclear
when, but Americans in the area were told to be ready.
   The State Department said the Voice of America was broadcasting
a message Thursday night saying, ``We are making preparations to
evacuate all U.S. citizens as soon as they are permitted to
leave.''
   Bush, citing the promised release of the hostages and the easing
of Iraq's pressure on the American Embassy in Kuwait, said, ``It
seems to be a little movement here, a little movement there,''
   Yet, he said, Saddam Hussein still ``must leave Kuwait without
reservation, without condition.''
   Bush spoke at a news conference at the next-to-last stop of his
five-nation South American tour while Baker, 5,000 miles away,
testified before Congress to win support for a possible military
strike against Iraqi forces.
   Baker said of Saddam's announcement, ``It seems to me no
coincidence that this comes just one week, just one week, after the
international community has authorized the use of force.''
   Yet, the dramatic move - if carried out - could well strengthen
demands in Congress that Bush allow more time for sanctions to work
before resorting to force.
   Facing Baker at a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, Rep.
Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., asked, ``Why should we not wait for this
policy of sanctions, diplomacy and putting in place a credible
military force ... to work?''
   ``What is working,'' Baker responded, ``is that we are beginning
finally to get the clear message across to Saddam Hussein. ... If
we want a peaceful solution, it should be crystal clear to them
that force is not going to be ruled out as an option.''
   Bush promised there would not be any secret deal with Saddam to
end the Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``There are no secret negotiations, direct or indirect with Iraq
over this question,'' Bush said. ``None. And there will be none.''
   Bush dismissed proposals circulating at the United Nations for a
Middle East peace conference, renewing his rejection of Saddam's
attempt to link resolution of the crisis with the Arab-Israeli
conflict.
   ``We are not going to get diverted from the full implementation
of the United Nations resolutions in order to give him some
face-saving way out of something he shouldn't have gotten into in
the first place,'' Bush said.
   ``I don't care about (saving) face; he doesn't need any face. He
needs to get out of Kuwait without trying to complicate this matter
by talking about some Middle East peace settlement or peace
conference.
   ``It is clear what his ploy is,'' Bush said, ``and that ploy is
not going to be successful.''
   The news of Saddam's pledge to release the hostages reached Bush
on Air Force One during a bumpy flight over the Andes from
Argentina to Chile on his salute-to-democracy tour. On Friday, he
will fly to Caracas, Venezuela, for an overnight visit before
returning to Washington.
   Release of the hostages has been a key demand of the United
States and the global coalition against Iraq, along with the
withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Kuwait, the restoration of the
exiled emir and a guarantee of security in the gulf.
   At a joint news conference with Chilean President Patricio
Aylwin, Bush said he hoped the Iraqi decision to release the
hostages could be believed. Some of the foreigners are being held
as shields to prevent attack against strategic targets.
   ``No single hostage should have been taken in the first place.
And I hope that it shows that the strategy is working and that
Saddam understands that his hostage policy has incurred the
condemnation of the whole world, the president said.
   ``And we've got to continue to keep the pressure on,'' said
Bush, who has authorized the deployment of more than 400,000
Americans to the gulf.
   The Pentagon said Thursday that Iraq had moved an additional
30,000 troops into Kuwait and southern Iraq, and that 10,000 U.S.
reinforcements had arrived in the Persian Gulf.
   There are now more than 480,000 Iraqi troops in the region and
more than 250,000 American troops, including at least 130,000 U.S.
Army soldiers in Saudi Arabia.
   Bush said his planned meeting with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq
Aziz, and a meeting between Baker and Saddam, would not be
negotiating sessions in which concessions might be offered to Iraq.
   ``What I want to do is be sure, by going this last, extra step
for peace, that the Iraqis know from me, and Aziz knows from me and
Saddam Hussein knows directly from the secretary of state, what is
at stake in this matter and how supportive the United States is of
the consolidated U.N. position,'' Bush said. ``And that's what it's
about.''
   On Capitol Hill, Baker also rejected Iraqi demands that the
talks include discussion of other Mideast issues.
   ``I will not be negotiating the Palestinian question or the
civil war in Lebanon,'' Baker said.
   Baker said anew that Bush hopes for a peaceful solution and has
not decided whether to use force immediately should Saddam ignore a
United Nations resolution demanding that Iraq withdraw from Kuwait
by Jan. 15.

<HEAD>FCC To Launch Search for Spectrum for New Radio-Based Technologies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the Federal Communications
Commission announced on Thursday an endeavor to squeeze future
technologies such as high-definition TV, personal phones and
digital radio onto the nation's crowded airwaves.
   FCC Chairman Alfred Sikes, noting that Congress and his agency
are making decisions today that will affect American lifestyles and
economic competitiveness well into the 21st century, said the FCC
will initiate a search next year for frequencies to satisfy the
voracious appetites of new radio-based technologies.
   ``My ultimate goal will be to create a new spectrum reserve for
emerging technologies,'' Sikes said in what was good news for a
host of would-be broadcasters and telecommunications companies that
are waging a fierce battle for wave space.
   But in a bit of bad news for existing licensees, Sikes warned
that locating spectrum to accommodate new technologies could not be
done without some pain to incumbents.
   ``If we are to have sufficient spectrum to meet projected new
technology needs, some of the incumbents will have to find new
homes,'' Sikes said in a speech to the Practicing Law Institute.
   He added, however, that the legitimate needs of incumbents must
be considered and that ``any comprehensive program will have to be
implemented over a period of years.''
   New technologies such as HDTV and pocket-sized, go-anywhere
telephones are expected to arrive worldwide by the end of the
decade and dramatically change today's communications systems.
   Digital broadcasting is another area of promise, in which
compact-disc quality sound may be available from traditional radio
stations or from new satellite companies.
   These technologies will require a radical overhaul of existing
transmission and receiving systems, creating new jobs and business
opportunities, and are expected to play a crucial role in
determining the nation's economic well-being in the next century.
   The House this year passed a bill by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich.,
that would force the government to relinquish for private use about
a third - 200 MHz - of the radio spectrum that is allocated
exclusively for government use. The bill did not get through the
Senate.
   Advocates of high-definition television, personal phones and
digital broadcasting are squabbling over spectrum now held by UHF
broadcasters, cellular telephone companies and microwave users such
as police and fire departments, mobile radio dispatchers, the space
industry, railroads and utilities.
   New and more spectrum-efficient radio technology promises to
ease the pain somewhat of reallocation of spectrum, and
technological advances also promise the ability for different users
to share space.
   But something will have to give somewhere, as Sikes noted, since
there is only so much wave space.
   ``The creation of spectrum reserve will not be without costs,''
Sikes said. ``But the benefits to the public of facilitating new
communications services will be dramatic.''
   He noted that in Europe and Japan, important chunks of the
airwaves already have been set aside for these emerging
technologies.
   ``We need to do at least as much as our international trading
partners,'' Sikes said.
   Sikes said the commission also will be looking at how to deal
with proposals to create new multiple-use technologies, such as
linking satellite and cellular systems together; allowing telephone
companies to provide cable TV service over phone lines; or allowing
cable and mobile communications companies to link up as an
alternative to private or public phone networks.

   Here are questions and answers dealing
with the Persian Gulf crisis, excerpted from President Bush's news
conference:
   Q. Mr. President, do you view Saddam's - do you view this
promise by Saddam Hussein to release the hostages as credible? And
will it affect the U.S. war footing in the Persian Gulf?
   A. One, I hope it is credible. Two, no single hostage should
have been taken in the first place. And I hope that shows that the
strategy is working and that Saddam understands that his hostage
policy has incurred the condemnation of the whole world. And we've
got to continue to keep the pressure on.
   And this would be welcomed, if true, but it will not change my
thinking on his need to comply 100 percent without condition to the
U.N. resolutions.
   ---
   Q. Mr. President, thank you. I wonder if you'd take te context
of what's going on since you got the U.N. resolution authorizing
the use of force. You know, you made the announcement last week
that they were resupplying and helping to resupply the U.S.
Embassy. Now, the announcement on the hostages. My question, Mr.
President, is whether you believe Saddam is serious about defusing
the tension, or if he is playing chess?
   A. Well, first, I don't consider a couple of cases of Pepsi-Cola
a serious release on our beleaguered embassy in Kuwait. I hope,
though, in response to the broader aspects of your question, that
Saddam Hussein is getting the message, the message so clearly
stated in the last U.N. resolution. And the release of all hostages
would be a very good thing.
   But the problem is the aggression against Kuwait, and the man
must leave Kuwait, without reservation, without condition. And the
whole world is united in this, and I will not speak for Chile, but
I believe the Chileans agree with that.
   ---
   Q. Mr. President, there were reports this morning, out of New
York apparently, linking American diplomats to a suggestion that
the U.S. might go along with a U.N. resolution backing a Mideast
peace conference. This was linked with Saddam's latest statement
about the hostages. Since then, we understand that Secretary Baker
has denied any change in the U.S. position. Certainly you have said
there should never be any linkage, and you're aware that Saddam is
trying to link them. However, having said that there is no linkage,
can you offer any hope that the United States might take a
favorable position toward a Mideast peace conference?
   A. The question is the aggression against Kuwait. There will be
and is no linkage to the Palestinian or the West Bank question. And
to help clarify, I would refer people to Secretary Baker's
statement today, to my comments at a press conference in Helsinki
with Mr. Gorbachev, and to what I said at the United Nations in my
speech. And I hope that will make clear there is no linkage.
   And the United States, of course, remains interested in a
solution to that other question. But there is no linkage with what
has to happen in Kuwait, or what will happen in Kuwait.
   ---
   Q. Mr. President, in making his announcement today, Saddam
Hussein said he was moved to release these hostages by what he
called ``positive diplomatic changes.'' Are there any secret
negotiations, back-door negotiations going on now between the
Iraqis and the U.S.? And when you sit down with Foreign Minister
Aziz, will you be laying down the law, or will you be offering
further incentives to encourage Iraq to leave Kuwait?
   A. One, there are no secret negotiations, direct or indirect,
with Iraq over this question. None, and there will be none - secret
negotiations of that nature.
   Secondly, I am not looking for incentive or further incentive.
What I want to do is be sure, by going this last extra step for
peace, that the Iraqis know from me, and Aziz knows from me, and
Saddam Hussein knows directly from the secretary of state what is
at stake in this matter and how supportive the United States is of
the consolidated U.N. position. And that's what it's about.
   And I said that before, and I'll keep repeating it because I
don't want any people to think there are secret negotiations going
on, or that I, on behalf of this worldwide coalition, will even
consider making a concession, if you will, or you can call it
incentive, if you will. That is not what these meetings are about.
   ---
   Q. Mr. President, I'd like to come back to John's question about
a Middle East peace conference. ...
   A. From the very beginning, Saddam Hussein has tried to justify
his illegal aggression against Iraq basdd on an overall Middle East
problem that involves the West Bank and the Palestine question. And
we are not going to get diverted from the full implementation of
the United Nations resolutions in order to give him some
face-saving way out of something he shouldn't have got into in the
first place.
   As you know, Jim Baker has been very active up until quite
recently in trying to move that whole peace process forward and we
continue to be very interested in moving the peace process forward.
But it will not be linked in any way with Saddam Hussein's
aggression. I don't care about face, he doesn't need any face, he
needs to get out of Kuwait without trying to complicate this matter
by talking about some Middle East peace settlement, or peace
conference. And it is clear what his ploy is, and that ploy is not
going to be successful.ssed on. That's the way the companies take
advantage of changing market conditions.''
   The oil industry, which maintains that prices are set by supply
and demand, says pricing is not such a simple thing.
   The American Petroleum Institute has acknowledged there are
times when savings have not been passed along promptly to
consumers, but it has also pointed out trends in which crude oil
prices were rising at the same time the pump price of gasoline was
falling.
   ``If the price of crude oil goes down and stays down, then the
price of gasoline will undoubtably follow,'' Institute spokesman
Gus Ensz said. ``It's difficult to analyze each and every
situation, because thousands of people are running service
stations, and the people who run those service stations make the
ultimate decision.''
   The industry has asserted that all recent probes into petroleum
pricing have given oil companies a clean bill of health, but
Rothschild said a comparison of recent prices shows that consumers
are paying too much.
   ``From the beginning of November to December, there's been a
20-cent-a-gallon drop in the spot price of gasoline, and yet
there's been barely any decrease at all in the (pump) price of
gasoline,'' Rothschild said. ``My suspicion is, if anything, we
should now be much more concerned about oil companies ripping
consumers off.''
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the leading market for
petroleum contracts, wholesale gasoline prices fell below 65 cents
Thursday, to the approximate level they were at right before Iraq
invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and caused a spike in the price of oil.
   But the latest nationwide survey by the American Automobile
Association found the average price of a gallon of self-serve
regular unleaded to be $1.387. That's 31.2 cents higher than the
price on Aug. 1, and just .1 cent less than AAA's highest recorded
price of $1.388, just before the Easter holiday in 1981, the AAA
said when the survey was released Tuesday.
   Gasoline was up 2.1 cents for the week, and AAA pointed out that
it probably would have fallen a few cents for the week had it not
been for the imposition of an additional 5.1-cent federal tax,
which took effect Saturday.
   Rothschild agreed that the tax had an impact and that otherwise
pump prices could be coming down, although he insisted any decrease
will take too long.
   Early in the latest oil crisis, the petroleum industry said
prices shot up quickly because companies were worried about paying
higher replacement costs for their overseas supplies. The industry
has also maintained that it showed restraint and never passed on
the complete cost increase to consumers.
   ``The replacement cost for crude has been steadily falling and
we have not seen steadily falling prices for gasoline and heating
oil,'' Rothschild said.

<HEAD>Owner of City Hall Seeks Eviction of City Workers for `Rent'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The secret trust that owns City Hall
is trying to evict about 200 City Hall workers because, claiming
the city owes nearly $500,000 in back rent on the building.
   Eviction notices for City Hall employees are only the newest
knot in a tangle of money troubles and lawsuits started when a
judge decided to give away City Hall to settle a damage suit.
   The latest development occurred when attorney Patrick M. Young
filed a lawsuit in St. Clair Circuit Court Nov. 21, saying East St.
Louis owes the private trust he represents $447,300 in rent unpaid
from Sept. 30 through Nov. 30.
   The city says it's nonsense.
   ``We don't owe any rent,'' City Attorney Eric E. Vickers said
Thursday. ``The city still owns the property.''
   But Vickers has also appealed the ruling by St. Clair County
Circuit Judge Roger Scrivner that awarded the City Hall building to
Walter DeBow.
   DeBow had been severely beaten in the city's jail several years
ago and won a $3.4 million damage award against the city, which
refused to pay.
   DeBow sold the building and two accompanying pieces of property
to the private trust for less than $200. The identity of the trust
remains a secret. Young estimated the value of City Hall at $7.5
million and the daily rent at $7,100.
   Young was out of his office Thursday and could not be reached
for comment.
   Vickers said he hadn't seen a copy of the lawsuit, but doubted
it was enforceable. He also said he wasn't aware of the city being
warned that eviction was likely, which is customary.
   ``We may try to seek an injunction,'' Vickers said. ``I don't
think anyone will be evicted.''
   On Wednesday, Vickers filed a countersuit in U.S. District Court
in St. Louis against Police Sgt. J.W. Cowan and his attorney, Amiel
Cueto. That was a week after Cowan sued Vickers for $12 million for
allegedly failing to file a timely appeal of the ruling that gave
away City Hall.
   Vickers called Cowan's suit ``political garbage'' aimed at Mayor
Carl E. Officer.
   ``I think with the city election coming, you've got shots being
taken at the mayor through me,'' he said. ``I didn't start this
nonsensical legal warfare, but I'm going to end it.''
   The city attorney is also seeking $25 million for the damage he
claims Cowan's lawsuit did to his reputation.

<HEAD>Medical Panel Calls for More Research on Female Biology</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ignorance about female biology still impedes
the treatment of breast cancer and other diseases of women, a panel
of scientists said Thursday.
   ``There's no research on the normal breast,'' said Dr. Susan
Love, an author and professor of surgery at Harvard. ``Therefore,
we don't have a clue when carcinogens are acting.''
   Yet breast cancer will strike one woman in 10 in her lifetime,
and will kill 44,000 this year, she said.
   ``It is appalling that in 1990 we have little or no information
on the natural course of the endocrine and tissue changes that
occur during menopause,'' said Barbara Sherwin of McGill
University.
   The two medical expas that medical professionals consider
closely but also look beyond the biological factors unique to women
- such as the menstrual cycle, pregnancy and hormonal differences.
   They said professionals also need to gather data on individual
patients' social and economic status as risk factors - poverty,
raising children alone - and on ``psychosocial'' factors such as
depression, occupational stress and the multiple demands on women
as mothers, workers and spouses.
   Special centers should be established at academic research
facilities to study the ``interactions and complexities'' that have
an impact on women's health, said Dr. Susan Blumenthal, chief of
the Behavioral Medicine Program at the National Institute of Mental
Health.
   That women generally live longer than men poses challenges in
itself, noted Dr. William Hazzard, chairman of the medical school
at Wake Forest University and spokeswoman for the cardiovascular
panel.
   For example, he said, heart disease accounts for more than a
quarter of all deaths in women in the United States. But women
suffer heart attacks and heart disease later in life, and often
they must endure their suffering alone while men usually have their
spouses for support, he said.
   The growing longevity of women also exacerbates ignorance about
menopause, said Sherwin. Changes brought about by menopause account
for an estimated 250,000 hip fractures a year.
   Another problem that follows menopause, urinary incontinence,
accounts for billions of dollars in costs not to mention the
``human misery'' that results from the problem, she said.
   Panelists in all four fields also agreed on the need for further
understanding of hormones, especially hormonal therapy, because of
their impact on diseases and treatments.
   ``We desperately and urgently need prospective studies of
post-menopausal hormones and their effects on cardiovascular
disease, on atherosclerosis, breast cancer and endometrial
cancer,'' said Love. ``Otherwise, women cannot make the decisions
that they need to make.
   ``It may be worth the small increase in breast cancer to
eliminate the large number of women dying of heart disease, but
until we know what risks we're weighing, we can't make those kinds
of decisons.''
   The panelists reiterated the criticism raised in recent months
in Congress that women are being excluded from clinical research,
and they noted efforts within the federal National Institutes of
Health to monitor research grants to be sure women are included.

   Jesse Jackson said Thursday he is considering
suing the federal government on behalf of citizens of the nation's
capital in an effort to gain statehood for the District of
Columbia.
   ``We're weighing a lawsuit on this matter,'' said Jackson, who
won election in November to an unofficial ``shadow'' Senate seat
from which he will lobby Congress to grant the district statehood.
``We are restricted to paying taxes without representation; we
serve up our sons and daughters in times of war, yet we have no
voting representation in Congress. That is fundamentally
undemocratic.''
   In outlining his lobbying strategy for statehood, the two-time
Democratic presidential contender said he will attempt to combine
litigation, lawmaking and mass protest in the fashion used by the
civil rights movement.
   Jackson did not provide specifics on the lawsuit.
   ``We're still researching this, but the whole thing would center
on the question of taxation without representation,'' said a top
Jackson aide who asked not to be named. ``It might well end up as a
standard, civil rights lawsuit.''
   Jackson aides said they are also trying to learn whether any
districts or territories have ever sued the federal government to
gain admission to the union. The ``shadow'' concept was first used
by the Tennessee territory prior to its admission to the United
States in 1796; the concept was last used by Alaska, which in 1959
became the nation's 49th state.
   The federal government would be the target of the lawsuit since
Congress governs the admission of states to the union, the aide
said.
   Another goal of the lawsuit would be to gain Jackson the right
to set up a separate office for statehood purposes if he so
chooses, Jackson aides said.
   Earlier this year, the General Accounting Office concluded that
``shadow'' congressional delegations could not use either public or
private funds to acquire office space without congressional
approval.

   A Republican logging supporter defeated
the incumbent for his legislative seat by one vote after a recount,
but she didn't gloat in the ``campaign from hell.''
   ``You can bet I'm not going to be running up and down the street
yelling, `Hey, I'm Representative Goos.' I'm not going to act like
an idiot,'' said Ann Goos, whose name rhymes with dose.
   State Rep. Evan Jones, D-Sequim, said he'll contest Wednesday's
results and demand a new recount.
   There is no legal limit to the number of recounts and the
Legislature could be asked to decide which candidate to seat, said
David Brine, spokesman for Secretary of State Ralph Munro.
   ``It ain't over 'til it's over,'' Jones said.
   Going into the recount, Jones led the race for the 24th District
seat by five votes. But when new tallies were added from three
counties, he trailed by one vote. The new total: Goos 16,167, Jones
16,166.
   Jones said he's evaluating which precincts and counties to
include in his demand for a recount, and whether to seek a hand
recount or a computer recount. He has to pay five cents a ballot
for the recheck.
   ``The one silver lining is that ... everyone thinks it is their
vote that made the difference - and they're all right, of course,''
Jones said. ``People can know that literally one vote makes a
difference.''
   Goos summed up the race as the ``campaign from hell.''

<TEXT>
   The Vatican restored diplomatic ties with
Bulgaria Thursday, thus achieving ties with all members of the
former Warsaw Pact and formally ending an era in which the church
and the East bloc were foes.
   The former hard-line Communist nation had been implicated in an
attempt to kill Pope John Paul II.
   In a brief statement, the Vatican said ties between the Holy See
and Bulgaria would be at the ambassadorial level.
   Diplomatic links were broken in 1949 when the Communist
government prevented the Vatican's representative from re-entering
the country.
   Since democratic revolutions swept Eastern Europe in the past 18
months ousting Communist governments, the Vatican has also restored
ties with Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania and Pope John Paul II's
native Poland.
   Also this year, ties were forged for the first time with the
Soviet Union.
   The pope has been invited to visit Bulgaria. He has already made
a brief trip to Czechoslovakia and is to travelt to Hungary in
1991.
   Relations between the Vatican and Bulgaria reached a
particularly low point after the 1981 assassination attempt on Pope
John Paul II.
   Italian prosecutors said the plot involved Bulgarian agents and
the Soviet KGB. A Rome court, however, acquitted three Bulgarians
of conspiracy to murder the pontiff, citing lack of evidence.
   Bulgaria denied involvement in the shooting, which was carried
out by a Turk.
   Catholics make up only around 1 percent of Bulgaria's population
of about 9 million.
   Under Bulgaria's previous Communist government, freedom of
religion was guaranteed by law. However, most Bulgarian Christians
were at least nominal members of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church,
which avoided antagonizing authority.
   The country has a large Moslem minority, but many discontinued
practice of their religion under pressure from the Communist
government.

<HEAD>CDC Reports Homicide Explosion for Young Black Males</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Homicide, the leading cause of death among young
black males, has increased by two-thirds among that group in four
years, researchers with the national Centers for Disease Control
reported Thursday.
   Nationwide, 2,741 black males aged 15 to 24 were homicide
victims in 1988, CDC epiemiologist Dr. Robert Froehlke said.
   The killings represent a rate of 101.1 for every 100,000 black
males in the age group, up 67 percent from the 1984 rate of 60.6.
   The new figures indicate a reversal in a trend that saw
homicides decrease among young black men in the early 1980s, the
CDC said.
   Meanwhile, rates for females and white males in that age group
``have either stayed essentially the same, or in fact decreased a
little bit,'' Froehlke said. ``The disparity between black males
and other groups has widened even more.''
   In 1987, the latest year in which complete statistics are
available, young black males' homicide rate is some six times
greater than the rate for all Americans aged 15-24; among blacks,
the rate was 84.6 per 100,000, compared with 13.8 per 100,000,
Froehlke said.
   The nation's overall homicide rate in 1987 was 8.5 per 100,000.
   That year, homicides accounted for 42 percent of the deaths of
black males in that age group.
   The CDC's analysis is based on 1987 figures. The 1988
statistics, released just last week, have not yet been analyzed
in-depth, Froehlke said.
   The homicide problem is getting worse faster for black teenage
males, the CDC said. The 1988 homicide rate for black males 15-19
was 76.8 per 100,000, up 99 percent since 1984. The rate for black
males 20-24 was 127.2 per 100,000, up 53 percent since 1984.
   Firearm homicides accounted for more than 95 percent of the
1984-87 increase in killings of young black males, the CDC said.
   Six areas - California, Florida, Michigan, Missouri, New York
and the District of Columbia - accounted for 51 percent of the
deaths of young black males in 1987.
   Those six locations have 29 percent of the nation's population
of black males aged 15-24, the CDC said.
   In its weekly report, the CDC called for more research into ways
to stop the killings.
   ``Research and evaluation efforts have not demonstrated
effective programmatic approaches to prevent homicide,'' the
Atlanta-based agency said.

   Elizabeth Taylor pretended she was horrified,
then joined the courtroom in a hearty laugh Thursday when a
prospective juror said he's seen most of the star's silent films.
   During the second day of jury selection in her court contest
with her ex-beau Henry Wynberg, a majority of potential panelists
said they have only vague memories of the 58-year-old Miss Taylor
as an actress. Wynberg claims he conceived the actress' popular
perfume Passion, and he's seeking a hefty share of some $70 million
a year in profit.
   Two prospective jurors said they had never seen the Academy
Award-winning actress on film and one associated her with the
silent-film era, which predates her career.
   ``I go back to the silent movies, so I've seen most of her
films,'' the panelist said when asked if he had ever seen Miss
Taylor on the screen.
   Miss Taylor, wearing a black dress and a thick gold necklace,
bracelet and earrings, reacted with a mock expression of horror,
then laughed along with others.
   When jury selection began Wednesday, Miss Taylor's bout with
alcoholism was raised as her lawyer probed prospective jurors'
feelings about the actress.
   The issue is relevant to her court contest because Wynberg
claims her alcoholism and related weight gain destroyed the
glamorous image he counted on to market cosmetics under her name.
   As Miss Taylor sat facing jurors, attorney Neil Papiano said:
``It has been fairly well publicized that Miss Taylor at one time
had an alcohol abuse problem and went to the Betty Ford Clinic and
since that time has had no problem.''
   The attorney asked the prospects whether they knew others with
such problems and had any views about rehabilitation programs. Most
said they knew alcoholics and approved of efforts to help them.
   Miss Taylor claims Wynberg's criminal record led her to abandon
their planned business deal and turn to the major cosmetics
company. She won permission to tell jurors about Wynberg's
statutory rape conviction.
   The legal dispute pits Miss Taylor against Wynberg, a former
used car salesman who courted her between her two marriages to
Richard Burton in the 1970s.
   Wynberg and Miss Taylor signed an agreement in Burton's presence
in 1975 for Wynberg to market cosmetics under Miss Taylor's name.
She says he breached the contract by doing nothing to fulfill it.
He says she breached it when she agreed to sell Passion through
another company.
   During jury questioning, Papiano asked panelists if they knew
about Miss Taylor's work for AIDS research and how they felt about
it.
   ``I support it,'' said one woman.
   ``I think it's a great cause,'' said another.
   The attorney explained later that the question was asked because
evidence will show that a percentage of Miss Taylor's profits from
Passion go to benefit research for acquired immune deficiency
syndrome.

   A fake edition of the student newspaper
carried a headline proclaiming ``U.S. Invades Iraq,'' and caused
some panic on campus.
   Students and staff at the State University of New York at
Binghamton hugged each other and cried. A dining hall worker whose
son is stationed in Saudi Arabia ran screaming from the building.
The school's radio station began broadcasting that the United
States had gone to war.
   One of the headlines announced, ``SUNY Binghamton Students
Drafted.''
   But both Page One stories Wednesday had disclaimers in their
last paragraphs on inside pages: ``The events described above have
not happened. Yet. But they may.''
   Editors of the real paper, called Pipe Dream, said a student
group, Looking Left, known for its radical politics, had published
the phony issue to make an anti-war statement.
   ``We were inundated with several hundred phone calls,'' said
junior Matthew Furman, managing editor of Pipe Dream.
   The editors rushed to distribute 4,000 printed fliers by
midafternoon that said war had not begun and that Pipe Dream had
not published the issue.
   University President Lois B. DeFleur called the publication ``a
grossly insensitive hoax.''
   David Anderson, interim vice president for student affairs, said
the publication violated the code of campus conduct. University
officials said the incident would be investigated.

<TEXT>
   The African National Congress
pressed its demand for an interim government Thursday in rallies
that drew 18,000 supporters, and it threatened to increase pressure
if its demands are not met.
   A stepped-up campaign of rallies and other mass action could
heighten tensions with the government, which considers such tactics
detrimental to the nation's stability, and delay talks on reform.
   In Johannesburg, ANC leader Mac Maharaj blamed the government
for the slow pace of talks with black leaders. About 40 miles north
in Pretoria, Winnie Mandela and Communist Party chief Joe Slovo
blamed security forces for violence in black townships.
   A third march was in Bloemfontein, 180 miles south of
Johannesburg.
   ``We say to the government: `Stop stalling on negotiations!'''
Maharaj told about 10,000 people in downtown Johannesburg. ``We
want an interim government now.'' Maharaj said those who have
presided over the apartheid system must not be allowed to oversee
change.
   President F.W. de Klerk has pledged to end apartheid and
negotiate a new constitution, but he rejects demands for an interim
government to oversee the changes.
   Demonstrators demanded the government speed up talks with the
ANC; make good on promises to release all political prisoners and
permit exiles to return; and take action to stop black factional
violence.
   Mrs. Mandela, the wife of ANC deputy president Nelson Mandela,
said in Pretoria that the peace process could be derailed if
township violence is not stopped.
   Mrs. Mandela repeated allegations that security forces have
sided against ANC supporters in township battles - a charge the
government denies. Since August, nearly 1,000 people have died in
Johannesburg townships. Most of the unrest involves backers of the
ANC and its main rival, the Inkatha Freedom Party.
   The 5,000 protesters marched to de Klerk's offices and handed
over a letter stating the demands. Security was tight, with
soldiers in riot gear and police dogs lining the route. At one
point, three Air Force Mirage fighter jets flew overhead.
   Demonstrators in Johannesburg marched several blocks to City
Hall and then to a police station with a list of demands. The ANC
said if the demands were not met, a program of boycotts and rallies
would be called.
   The government has denounced such actions, saying activities
such as marches and strikes lead to violence. Black leaders accuse
security forces of causing the violence by interfering in peaceful
protests.
   The demands presented Thursday included freedom by Christmas of
all political prisoners, an interim government, and the integration
of Bophuthatswana into South Africa.
   Bophuthatswana is a black homeland considered independent by the
South African government but not recognized as such by other
nations. The ANC considers the homeland system an attempt by the
government to perpetuate apartheid by keeping blacks and whites
apart.
   About 3,000 people rallied peacefully in Bloemfontein.
   The ANC supporters were joined by members of the closely allied
South African Communist Party and ANC-aligned trade unions.
   The Johannesburg demonstration was the first mass rally in the
city since Nov. 17, when two people died in clashes with police
after an illegal march. No violence was reported Thursday, and
police presence was not heavy. All three marches had official
permission.

<HEAD>Soaring Deficit Will Test Voters' Tolerance of Red Ink</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New estimates that the budget deficit is
soaring past $300 billion will test voters' tolerance for federal
red ink, but analysts are divided over whether the record
shortfalls will blunt Congress' spending appetite.
   The Congressional Budget Office projected Thursday that next
year's budget gap will be at least $337 billion. The non-partisan
budget office blamed the slowing economy and the expensive bailout
of the nation's savings and loans.
   That would easily set a record - despite the Nov. 5 enactment of
a five-year package of tax increases and spending cuts designed to
shrink the deficits by $496 billion in that period.
   The record deficit ``puts one more arrow in the quiver of those
who would oppose higher spending,'' said Carol Cox, president of
the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan group
that studies budget issues. ``There is a political constraint in an
era of $300 billion deficits when somebody wants to spend even more
money.''
   Others noted that new budget procedures virtually eliminate the
current system of across-the-board spending cuts if the deficit is
too high. As a result, they said, large budget gaps may not
dissuade Congress from seeking new spending programs.
   ``With the new system, we're suddenly being told that the
deficit is not the real enemy,'' said Stanley Collender, a budget
analyst for the accounting firm of Price Waterhouse. ``The last
decade has shown that the average American doesn't want spending to
stop.''
   But Collender said that with deficits expected to hit record
levels for the next few years, it was unclear how Americans would
react.
   ``We'll be really testing the mettle of the American people on
this stuff,'' Collender said. ``If they get riled up, a person who
proposes new spending will at a disadvantage. But that's a big if.
We haven't seen that before.''
   CBO Director Robert Reischauer warned the House Budget Committee
that with the economy continuing to worsen, next year's shortfall
could well be even worse than $337 billion. As the economy
declines, the government collects less revenue and spends more for
unemployment and other programs, driving up the deficit.
   Reischauer told the lawmakers that he expected the economy to
shrink during the last three months of 1990, and that the same
thing would probably happen during the first quarter of 1991 if the
large U.S. troop deployment in the Middle East continues. But he
did predict an improving economy beginning in 1992, and a shrinking
federal deficit.
   ``It looks like a period of weakness, followed by a rebound,''
he said.
   This year's budget gap should be $320 billion, the CBO said.
Fiscal 1991 runs through next Sept. 30.
   The deficit for fiscal 1990 was $220 billion, just below the
record $221 billion shortfall in 1986.
   Those figures cannot be directly compared with the $320 billion
projection for next year.
   Past years' deficits included the huge and growing Social
Security surplus, expected to reach $66 billion this year.
   Under new budget rules, that surplus is no longer included in
federal deficit calculations. The fiscal 1990 budget gap would have
been $277 billion had the Social Security surplus not been included
in the deficit figures.
   The new deficit calculations also do not include the costs of
Operation Desert Shield, which will be counted separately.
Reischauer said U.S. operations in the Persian Gulf this year will
probably cost $12 billion if fighting does not break out. He had no
figures on the costs if war erupts.

   Her car was never mistakenly towed. She was
never charged with someone else's unpaid fines, never billed for a
ticket she'd already paid. But Barbara James has won the
competition for the city's ``worst parking nightmare.''
   ``You're kidding,'' the 33-year-old advertising consultant from
Clifton, N.J., said Thursday when informed she had won the $100
grand prize.
   Her skepticism was understandable, for this is the city where
the parking nightmare was invented. An ever-growing number of
vehicles and an ever-shrinking number of parking spaces has created
a happy hunting ground for quota-burdened ticket agents and tow
truck crews.
   In such an environment, Mrs. James' nightmare sounds more like
an unpleasant daydream. But welcome to it:
   Eight years ago Barbara was single, living in the city and
dating Bob James, who would become her husband. He was living in
New Jersey, where she refused to go, and drove ``a snazzy, sporty
Mustang.''
   She persuaded Bob, against his better judgment, to drive into
the city for the last night of the San Gennaro festival in Little
Italy, a cramped old neighborhood.
   But Bob and Barbara found what looked like a parking space just
two blocks from the festival. There were other cars parked on the
block, none were ticketed, and a sign said, ``No Parking Until 6
p.m.'' It was 5:55.
   They asked a policeman standing on the corner if they could park
there, and he said go ahead. The couple giddily walked off.
   Here's the rest of the story, according to Mrs. James: ``We came
back, stuffed with cannoli, and almost threw up when we found a $35
parking ticket on the car - issued at 5:59, not 30 seconds after
the cop assured us it as OK to park!''
   Bob wrote out a check, smeared the ticket with marinara sauce,
and mailed both to the city.
   However luckless in parking, Mrs. James does well in contests.
Several years ago she won a Caribbean cruise by composing a poem of
25 words or less on the topic ``What I'd Do for a Miller Beer.''
   But she was surprised that her entry won the parking nightmare
competition, which was staged by Glenn Bolofsky, publisher of a
calendar that charts the days when the city's byzantine
alternate-side-of-the-street parking rules are suspended. Bolofsky
said he received more than 200 entries.
   There are many local drivers with a better claim on the $100,
and who need it more than Mrs. James:
   -Michael Cutrone, who had to pay $8,240 in parking tickets even
though copies of the tickets showed they were not issued to his
car. He paid after the city's Parking Violations Bureau obtained a
lien on his house.
   -Carlos Gonzales, whose Nissan was seized while he was in church
because the bureau claimed he owed about $5,400 in fines and
interest. But the car to which the tickets were issued was a
Pontiac belonging to another Carlos Gonzales, who had the same
birthday as the Nissan owner.
   -JoAnn DiDomenico, who paid the same parking ticket twice: $20
on Sept. 1, 1987, and $45 (including penalty) the following spring
after the bureau changed computers, lost record of her first
payment, and billed her a second time.
   None of these unfortunates entered the contest, however. ``Maybe
they just want to forget,'' Bolofsky mused.
   Mrs. James feels sorry for them, but she'll take the $100.
She'll also take her free copy of the parking calendar, even though
she never drives into New York. ``I've learned my lesson,'' she
said. ``I take the bus.''

   The U.S. government advised American hostages
in Iraq and Kuwait on Thursday to ``stay where you are'' until
arrangements can be worked out for their safe return to the United
States following an Iraqi pledge to release all foreigners.
   The Iraqi ambassador said he hoped all could be out by
Christmas.
   U.S. officials say there are fewer than 1,000 American citizens
still in Iraq and Iraqi-occupied Kuwait.
   At last count, 88 were being held at strategic installations as
human shields to ward off attack by the U.S.-led international
forces massed around Iraq. Many more have remained in hiding,
unable to leave the country and unwilling to be rounded up for
possible assignment to Iraqi military bases.
   The State Department said Thursday it was making arrangements to
evacuate all Americans and their foreign-born family members as
soon as they obtain exit permits or waivers allowing them to leave.
   In a message for broadcast to the region over Voice of America,
the department acknowledged Iraq's announced intention to release
all foreigners and said, ``We have asked for, but not yet received,
information from the Iraqi government on when and how such releases
can take place.''
   In the meantime, the message said, ``Stay where you are, stay in
touch with the U.S. Embassy and monitor the VOA closely. We will
let you know as soon as we have more information.''
   A U.S. official, who asked not to be identified by name, said
once the hostages are permitted to leave, they can be home in two
or three days.
   Iraqi Ambassador Mohamed Al-Mashat suggested in Washington that
people would be leaving ``within days.'' He added, ``Of course I
cannot now tell how long it will take to provide all the necessary
things for departure but I hope that they will be all of them out
for Christmas.''
   The United States has evacuated 2,250 U.S. citizens and
foreign-born family members since the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait. Generally, they have been flown out of the country by Iraqi
air charters that start out in Baghdad, fly to Kuwait to pick up
passengers, return to Baghdad, then fly on to Amman, Jordan. From
there, the Americans are flown either to Frankfurt or London, where
they stay overnight en route to the United States.
   The official said the State Department and a team of federal
officials from the Immigration and Naturalization Service, Customs
and other agencies meets each evacuation flight at its port of
entry to smooth the hostages' return.
   The State Department has expressed particular concern for 49
Americans, including 21 of those held at strategic sites, who are
said to have medical conditions that require special attention.
   In addition to those who have been unable to leave, eight U.S.
diplomats have been holding out inside the American Embassy
compound in Kuwait in defiance of Iraqi orders to close down all
foreign embassies in the territory it annexed after the invasion.
Nineteen private citizens, the last of more than 100 who sought
refuge initially, are believed to remain with them.

   Testing of equipment designed to help
airliners avoid collisions on runways has uncovered flaws that
could delay by a year plans to use the radar system at 29 airports
nationwide, the system's maker said.
   Among those to receive the new ground radar system is Detroit
Metropolitan Airport, where two jets collided on a runway Monday,
killing eight people and and injuring another 24.
   The system, which uses radio waves to relay images of ground
traffic to the the control tower might have averted Monday's
accident, said Phil Leman, an Federal Aviation Administration
electronic engineer involved in testing.
   But a key component in the ground radar system being tested at
Greater Pittsburgh International Airport is falling apart and must
be replaced before it can be used, said Scott Brinckerhoff, a
spokesman for the manufacturer, Norden Systems Inc. of Norwalk,
Conn.
   A reflector in the system antenna atop the airport's control
tower separates from the antenna's outer surface when the unit
spins, said Brinckerhoff.
   Norden plans to replace the antenna before testing continues, he
said.
   The problems with the antenna and software have delayed use of
the so-called Airport Surface Detection Equipment 3 at Pittsburgh
and installation of similar systems at 28 other airports.
   A new prototype should be in operation by fall 1991, about one
year later than expected, said FAA spokesman Dick Stafford.
   Norden had wanted to install all systems by July 1992, said
Brinckerhoff. It will ask the FAA for a one-year extension, he
said.
   Of the airports to receive the system, 13 have older ground
radar systems and 16, including those at Pittsburgh and Detroit,
have no ground radar, the FAA said.

<HEAD>Pope Supports Program to Combat Anti-Semitism in Eastern Europe</HEAD>

<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II on Thursday voiced support
for a plan to combat rising anti-Semitism in Eastern Europe, but
Vatican officials declined appeals by a Jewish delegation to
recognize Israel.
   A Jewish leader, Seymour Reich, said two days of talks between
the Jewish delegation and the Vatican marked ``the beginning of a
new chapter'' in the Catholic-Jewish relationship.
   But he said delegates of the International Jewish Committee on
Interreligious Consultations were ``somewhat disappointed'' the
pope did not go further in his comments.
   The Vatican's new foreign minister, Monsignor Jean-Louis Tauran,
cited the Vatican's traditional reasons for not recognizing Israel,
including unsettled borders, the status of Jerusalem and the
Palestinians' lack of a homeland.
   The pope hailed progress in relations between Jews and Catholics
in his speech to the 30-member Jewish delegation and top Vatican
officials.
   In particular, he praised a September plan drawn up by Jews and
Catholics in Prague, Czechoslovakia, for fighting anti-Semitism in
Eastern Europe.
   The six-point plan included calls for setting up courses for
priests to counter anti-Jewish sentiment, and omiting religiously
divisive material from textbooks.
   The Prague meeting also branded anti-Semitism a sin.
   Jewish leaders have expressed concern about an upsurge of
anti-Semitism in the former Communist countries of Eastern Europe,
including the pope's native Poland.
   The pope praised the Prague meeting for coming ``to conclusions
that are of great importance for the continuation of our dialogue
and cooperation. It is my hope that these may be widely recognized
and that the recommendations then formulated will be implemented
wherever human and religious rights are violated.''
   Besides the pope's endorsement for the plan to combat
anti-Semitism, the Jewish delegation had sought the Vatican's
formal recognition of Israel.
   But Reich, of Great Neck, N.Y., said they saw no change in the
Vatican position on the Jewish State.
   Reich said the Jewish delegates told Vatican officials, ``there
can be no full normalization of relations between the Catholic and
Jewish communities until the Vatican has full normalization of
relations with the Jewish state.''
   Nevertheless, delegates said the one-hour papal meeting was
warm. Lisa Palmieri-Billig of the Anti-Defamation League, quoted
the pope as reiterating his wish to visit the Holy Land.
   ``I hope one day to be able to visit the holy sites, beginning
with those of Abraham'' in Jerusalem, he said, according to
Palmieri-Billig.
   ``That would be our joy,'' replied Rabbi David Rosen, according
to Palmieri-Billig. Rosen is a representative of the
Anti-Defamation League in Jerusalem.
   The Catholic-Jewish meetings were held to mark the 25th
anniversary of Nostra Aetate, adopted during the Second Vatican
Council. The document, considered a turning point in
Catholic-Jewish relations, withdrew the accusation that the Jews
were responsible for killing Christ.

   Moldavia loosened restrictions Thursday on an
ethnic minority within its borders, but Russian officials
complained that its nationals were being harassed, news reports
said.
   As the country's fragmentation continued, a newspaper also
criticized local officials in Uzbekistan over Sunday's clashes in
Namangan that left five soldiers and three civilians dead.
   The Moldavian parliament lifted emergency rules in the southern
corner of its republic where a Christian Turkish minority, the
Gagauz, triggered tense standoffs in October when they demanded
autonomy, the official news agency Tass said.
   The lawmakers, indicating the situation had improved, said the
Soviet Interior Ministry should leave the area within three days
and special administrators should hand control back to local
officials, Tass said.
   Meanwhile in Moscow, one chamber of the Russian republic
legislation approved a resolution appealing to the other 14
republics to stop the ``pressure'' on ethnic Russians living in
non-Russian republics.
   The chamber charged that ``our compatriots are compelled to
leave their homes,'' and urged republic parliaments ``to settle
inter-ethnic problems through negotiations and with due regard for
the interests of all people concerned,'' the independent Interfax
news agency reported.
   Ethnic Russians, who make up more than half the population of
the country, have sizable communities in every non-Russian
republic, sometimes outnumbering the indigenous population. Some of
the ethnic groups within republics have sided with the Kremlin
against republic leaders, leading to intra-republic tension and
sometimes violence.
   The clashes in the Central Asian town of Namangan came between
local residents and Soviet troops. Witnesses told the labor
newspaper Trud that the clashes were not spontaneous, but were
planned in advance by residents who had stockpiled stones, metal
bars, and pipe cutters.
   Local authorities had said the soldiers were drunk and harassing
women on a bus when the clashes broke out. But the newspaper said
investigation has shown the dead soldiers had no alcohol in their
blood.
   It also complained that all information about the clashes came
from national broadcasts and newspapers, and that local media were
silent on the deaths.

   Fire gutted the University of North
Carolina Press headquarters, destroying rare books and
irreplaceable manuscripts, officials said.
   The fire broke out about 6 p.m. Wednesday at the building near
the university's Chapel Hill campus and caused some $500,000 in
damage, authorities said. No injuries were reported.
   Richard Hendel, the university press' associate director, said
he believed some items destroyed in the fire were irreplaceable,
adding:
   ``There were some new manuscripts in the editorial department,
and those would have to be edited all over again. There also were a
few rare books in our library. I'm sure there are copies elsewhere,
but they will be difficult to find.''
   Many computer files also were lost, he said.
   Hendel was the only person in the building when the fire
erupted. He said two men - apparently university students - knocked
on his office window and alerted him to the blaze.
   The fire's cause was under investigation Thursday, a fire
department spokesman said.
   The university press, founded in 1923, specializes in topics
relating to North Carolina and the South. It has published books on
subjects including black history, botany and literary criticism.
   One book the press published, ``The Transformation of Virginia,
1740-1790'' by Rhys L. Isaac won the Pulitzer Prize for history in
1983.

   In compelling James Grogan to testify, the
Senate Ethics Committee is summoning the person who probably knows
more than anyone but Charles H. Keating Jr. about Keating's
relationship with five powerful senators.
   At the start of Thursday's 13th day of hearings, the committee
announced Grogan will begin closed-door testimony on Dec. 17,
followed by his appearance at an open hearing.
   Grogan was Keating's main liaison with Congress. He's the man
who can tie together any relationship between the money Keating
raised for the Keating Five and their intervention with thrift
regulators on his behalf.
   Documents released in the case show that Grogan, who earlier
declined to testify on Fifth Amendment grounds, had often arranged
for Keating's political donations and had enlisted the senators'
backing for Keating's failing Lincoln Savings and Loan.
   In testimony Thursday, a career counsel for the Federal Home
Loan Bank Board, William K. Black, said the five senators mounted
``defense after defense after defense'' of Lincoln at a 1987
meeting when examiners informed them of massive violation's at
Keating's thrift.
   And the senators did so, Black said, ``despite use laying out in
the starkest terms ... exactly what was wrong, and it didn't
impress them.''
   But four members of the ethics panel appeared skeptical about
whether the senators had been as aggressive as portrayed by Black.
Sen. Terry Sanford, D-N.C., accused the witness and his fellow
regulators of having a ``siege mentality'' when they entered the
meeting with the five lawmakers.
   The committee is trying to learn whether the $1.3 million
Keating raised for the five influenced their conduct. The senators
are Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.; John McCain, R-Ariz.; Donald W.
Riegle Jr., D-Mich.; Alan Cranston, D-Calif., and John Glenn,
D-Ohio.
   Grogan was the corporate counsel for Keating's American
Continental Corp. and vice president of Lincoln. He undertook
several activities that could spark the committee's interest. For
instance, he:
   -Arranged for Keating's contributions to three
voter-registration projects supported by Cranston. Keating donated
$850,000.
   -Set in motion a complaint by a Cranston aide to regulators
about a tough enforcement action planned against Lincoln in May
1988.
   -Played a role in arranging two crucial meetings with
regulators. One, on April 2, 1987, involved all of the five
senators except Riegle; the second, a week later, included all the
senators.
   -Was told in a memo from Keating to try to get Black fired for
his tough stance against Lincoln.
   In that July 1987 memo, Keating wrote:
   ``Highest priority - get Black. Good grief - If you can't get
Wright and Congress to get Black - kill him dead - you ought to
retire.'' Wright is a reference to former House Speaker Jim Wright.
   Black, testifying Thursday, repeated his assertion that
political pressure by the senators caused the bank board to loosen
its regulatory control on Lincoln.
   He blamed the senators' pressure for the decision by top
regulators in Washington to take San Francisco-based regulators off
the examination of Lincoln. The examination, he said, would have
disclosed phony transactions and a ``tax-sharing scam'' that sent
false profits to Lincoln's parent company.
   ``This is the most likely explanation for this completely
unprecedented and grossly improper action of halting the
examination that would have blown all of these thing so wide
open,'' Black said.
   The committee's vice chairman, Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H.,
announced Thursday that, under a grant of limited immunity, Grogan
will be asked to produce key documents Wednesday - five days before
his closed-door testimony.
   There could be more private testimony after Dec. 17, and then
public testimony by Grogan after that. The revised schedule will
delay testimony from the five senators until they hear what Grogan
has to say, Rudman announced.
   Seven witnesses, including Grogan and Keating, have refused to
testify on Fifth Amendment grounds. Rudman said Keating would not
be offered immunity and is not expected to appear.
   Documents abound on Grogan's role in dealing with the senators
and their aides.
   On Oct. 6, 1987, Cranston wrote Keating, ``I am very grateful
for your willingness to contribute $250,000 this year, and have
asked Joy to discuss with Jim Grogan the states in which you would
most like to help.''
   Joy is Cranston fund-raiser Joy Jacobson. The money was for
voter-registration projects.
   In the same letter, Cranston expressed his pleasure that
Keating's meeting with M. Danny Wall, then chairman of the Federal
Home Loan Bank Board, ``had gone so well.''
   On May 6, 1988, Cranston aide Carolyn Jordan wrote the senator
that she had just received a call from Grogan, who said the board
had ``decided to take an enforcement action against Lincoln,''
including placing an overseer at the institution.
   Black testified that Ms. Jordan then complained to the
regulators - causing a weakening of the action and eventually
delaying the takeover.
   Glenn, in his opening statement, said Grogan, who once worked
for the senator, had influenced his attendance at the April 2, 1987
meeting with regulators.
   Grogan, according to Glenn, ``had told my staff that Lincoln was
being harassed and was receiving unfair treatment by federal
banking regulators.''
   Glenn said he then asked his staff for additional evidence of
unfair treatment - a corroboration he said was routine even though
the staff ``knew and trusted Jim Grogan.''

<HEAD>State Department Says Carter Agreed Not to Intervene in Liberia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL PUTZEL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department said Thursday former
President Jimmy Carter agreed last summer that beleaguered Liberian
President Samuel Doe's appeal for Carter's intervention to halt a
civil war was unworkable.
   Carter, in a broadcast interview published Wednesday, said the
State Department asked him not to play peacemaker in the bloody
Liberian civil war and he obeyed.
   The former president said Doe, who was later killed by rebel
forces, appealed to him last summer to come to Liberia to negotiate
a peaceful solution to the civil war.
   ``I called the State Department and told them that I had this
invitation, that I thought horrendous bloodshed was going to take
place in Liberia,'' Carter said in a recent interview conducted for
Alabama Public Television. ``After a day or two, they called back
and asked me not to go, so I didn't.''
   David Denny, a State Department spokesman, said Thursday that
Doe asked the department last June to deliver a letter to Carter
``in which Doe asked for President Carter's assistance for holding
early elections in Liberia.''
   ``At that time, Doe's executive mansion was already under
siege,'' the spokesman said in a department response to a query
from The Associated Press. ``His calls for an election were
rejected by the other parties. U.S. policy was to encourage Doe to
enter into serious negotiations with other political and military
forces to try to bring about a settlement to the Liberian crisis.''
   Denny said Carter was briefed by telephone on the situation and
``our view of the essential unworkability of Doe's appeal.''
   ``At that time, President Carter agreed with our approach,'' the
spokesman reported.
   Doe, a 40-year-old master sergeant who had seized power in a
bloody coup in 1980, was slain in September by a break-away rebel
force after being lured to what was billed as a meeting to discuss
a peaceful settlement of the conflict.
   Tribal massacres in the wake of the bloody power struggle have
claimed more than 10,000 lives, and about half of Liberia's 2.3
million people are estimated to have sought refuge in neighboring
countries.
   Carter, who was the only American president to visit Liberia,
said he now devotes his efforts to ``waging peace'' in troubled
areas of the world. He has acted as mediator in two of the African
continent's most intractable wars, in Ethiopia and the Sudan.
   He cited the Liberian case as an example of his willingness to
back away from sensitive issues and accept the advice of the State
Department. Spokesmen for the department declined comment Wednesday
on Carter's remarks.
   Carter said he routinely shares his invitations with President
Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III, whom he described
as very supportive.
   ``Sometimes they request that I not undertake a project where
I've been invited in, and invariably I defer to their request,'' he
said. He did not say who asked him to turn down Doe's request to
visit Liberia, which was founded by freed American slaves in 1847.

<HEAD>Lawyer for Jim Bakker Donors Blames PTL Accountants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL NOWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer for thousands of PTL
contributors suing to get their money back argued Thursday a fraud
scheme that put Jim Bakker in prison worked only because he had
help from his accountants.
   Tom Anderson, an attorney for former Bakker believers in a $757
million lawsuit, blamed the accounting firm Deloitte, Haskins &amp;
Sells for his clients' troubles.
   ``If Deloitte had not aided and abetted, we would not be here,''
he said.
   Anderson made the remarks during his closing argument in a
six-week civil trial. About 145,000 people are seeking
reimbursement for money they paid to stay at Heritage USA, PTL's
now-defunct religious theme park in Fort Mill, S.C. Lodging at the
park entitled donors to be ``lifetime partners'' in PTL, Bakker's
bankrupt ministry.
   Bakker, 49, is serving a 45-year prison sentence on conspiracy
and mail fraud charges for overselling lifetime partnerships.
   The lawsuit said Bakker, other PTL officials and accountants
including those of Deloitte conspired to set up secret bank
accounts that were tapped to give huge bonuses to the Bakkers and
ministry officials.
   The case could go to the jury Friday.
   Attorneys for Bakker and Deloitte argued that when it came to
using donations, no harm was intended by the televangelist, his
wife, Tammy, and other PTL officials.
   ``Jim Bakker did not intentionally wrong his people,'' said his
lawyer, Jim Toms. ``Like all men, he was flawed and he made
mistakes. But he gave every ounce of his strength to build his
dream.''
   ``Corporate America will be listening to your verdict, whatever
it is,'' Anderson said. ``The auditing profession will be
listening.''
   Jim Williams, representing Deloitte, told the jury: ``I'm not
representing corporate America.''
   In his opening argument, Anderson sought to simplify the case,
which has generated volumes of evidence and brought dozens of
witnesses to the federal courthouse here.
   ``This is a case in which Jim Bakker stole from the church. This
is a case in which Jim Bakker defrauded the lifetime partners and
he went to jail for this,'' Anderson said. ``Deloitte knew all
about the fraud. This is a case in which Deloitte didn't tell
anyone.''
   Toms said there was nothing simple about PTL or Bakker.
   ``This was not a simple man. This was not a simple place,'' he
said. ``It was not a simple task he was undertaking.''
   Toms described Bakker and his PTL followers as people of faith
and vision.
   ``Visionaries may not always be practical, but they're people of
faith who in their day did great things,'' Toms said.
   The lawsuit also named the accounting firm of Laventhol &amp;
Horwath as a defendant. The firm has since filed for bankruptcy
protection and last month its attorneys withdrew from the trial.
   The other defendants are David Taggart, Bakker's former personal
aide, and Aimee Cortese, a minister from New York who served on
PTL's board of directors in the mid 1980s.
   Bakker did not testify at the trial. Mrs. Bakker was never
charged.
   Three othe PTL officials have gone to jail for charges related
to the case.

   The government is expected to give American
women their first new birth control option in three decades when it
approves a hormonal implant that prevents pregnancy for up to five
years, officials said Thursday.
   The implant, called Norplant, was expected to win government
approval within days, according to government and industry sources
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The method involves implanting in a woman's upper arm six
silicone rubber capsules, each about the size of an
inch-and-a-half-long wooden matchstick. The procedure is done with
local anesthesia and the implant isn't noticeable.
   The capsules contain a hormone called levonorgestrel, a
synthetic progestin, that is released slowly over time.
   The contraceptive effects are reversed immediately upon removal.
   ``Norplant is one of the most significant advances in
contraception we've had in the last 30 years,'' since the birth
control pill and intrauterine device became available, said Dr.
Samuel A. Pasquale of the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New
Brunswick, N.J.
   ``It's the most effective, reversible method of contraception''
available in the United States, with a failure rate of less than 1
percent, said Pasquale, a principal investigator in the Norplant
studies.
   It also would be the first long-acting, hormonal contraceptive
available in this country.
   ``It's a new choice women have and there haven't been any new
choices in the United States in a long time,'' said C. Wayne
Bardin, vice president and director of medical research for the New
York-based Population Council, which began researching the method
in 1966.
   ``It offers them a new choice which is long-lasting and
convenient, uses the lowest dose of hormone that's used in any
(hormone-based method) and it doesn't contain estrogen,'' which can
cause problems for some women, he said.
   Norplant has been approved in 16 countries, the council said.
   In the United States, it would be marketed by Wyeth-Ayerst
Laboratories of Philadelphia.
   The company was reluctant to talk about Norplant without formal
approval from the Food and Drug Administration.
   However, Wyeth-Ayerst spokeswoman Audrey Ashby said that
assuming the drug is approved soon, the contraceptive would be
available commercially in February. The company will train
physicians on how to implant the capsules, but ``there will be some
lag time,'' she said.
   Ashby declined to discuss the cost of Norplant, saying that
pricing was being evaluated. However, she said expected it ``will
be priced significantly below oral contraceptives over five
years.''
   Birth control pills cost about $15 to $20 per month.
   Bardin said he had been told the price for Norplant would be
$200 to $300, which does not include the fee for implanting the
device.
   That cost worries Lisa Kaeser of the Alan Guttmacher Institute,
a research and education group that deals with reproductive health
issues.
   ``I'm not sure it's going to be available for low-income
women,'' she said.
   The contraceptive contains nothing new - the silicone rubber and
the hormone have been used for many years, according to the
council's literature. However, the delivery over a long period of
time is a new technique.
   An FDA advisory board recommended approval of Norplant in April
1989, saying the method was at least as safe and effective as any
other contraceptive on the market.
   The National Women's Health Network has expressed concern about
the long-term safety of the implant and wants post-marketing
surveillance to be conducted for 15 years to get more data.
   The contraceptive is more than 99 percent effective overall,
meaning that for every 100 women who use Norplant for one year, at
most one will become pregnant, according to the council's
literature.
   During the first two years, the pregnancy rate for women on
Norplant was one per 200 to 300 per year, Pasquale said. In the
third year, however, women weighing more than 154 pounds had a
higher pregnancy rate, about five per 100, he said.
   Its major side effect is menstrual irregularities, including
prolonged periods and spotting between periods. About 15 percen of
women who have the implant have it removed because of bleeding,
Bardin said.
   ``It's been very popular in other countries,'' Bardin said. ``If
you ask women what they like about it most, they say convenience.''
   Norplant seems to be more popular when compared with oral
contraceptives, he said. Among women who discontinue either after
less than a year, 15 percent stopped using Norplant compared with
50 percent who stopped using the pill, he said.

<HEAD>Lung Cancer Continues to Rise Faster Among Women</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Deaths from lung cancer are continuing to
increase faster among women than men, said health researchers who
predict the trend won't slow down until 2013.
   The federal Centers for Disease Control said Thursday that lung
cancer incidence and death rates for 1987 sustained a pattern of
the 1980s: increasing steadily for women and fluctuating slightly
for men.
   Previous studies have blamed increasing lung cancer rates among
women on their giving up smoking less readily than men.
   CDC researchers estimate that 85 percent of lung cancer cases
are caused by smoking. That excludes cases in non-smokers caused by
second-hand smoke, said Dr. Ronald Aubert, a CDC epidemiologist.
   ``The whole passive smoking issue has been recognized more and
more recently, and that's something to take into account,'' he
said.
   The lung cancer death rate in this country rose slightly from
1980 to 1987, from 42.5 per 100,000 population to 47.9. The rate
for males - who still suffer the most lung cancer, despite the
increases among women - rose by fewer than 5 percentage points,
from 71.6 to 75.0.
   But the lung cancer death rate for women increased by more than
one-third in seven years, from 20.9 in 1980 to 28.2 in 1987, Aubert
said.
   Similarly, lung cancer incidence nationwide increased from a
rate of 52.4 in 1980 to 55.5 in 1986 - the latest year available
for those statistics - and increased faster for women than for men.
   The increases in lung cancer incidence and death rates among
women ``are consistent with historically increasing trends in
smoking,'' the Atlanta-based CDC said.
   CDC researchers cautioned that because peaks in smoking are
historically followed by peaks in lung cancer as much as 35 years
later, today's lung cancer increases in women will continue for
decades.
   ``Based on these trends, the increases ... for females are not
expected to plateau until after the year 2013,'' the CDC said,
citing a math-model projection taking into account smoking
prevalences and progression of disease.
   ``That's our best guesstimate,'' Aubert said. ``I don't think
it's fully understood why you have some more rapid growing cancers
for some people, and not for others.''
   In general, lung cancer death rates in the 1980s have been
higher for black men than for white men, but did not differ
significantly between white and black women, the CDC reported.
   Surveys have shown that smoking prevalence is higher among black
men, who also tend to smoke brands higher in tar and nicotine, the
CDC said.

<HEAD>Now Powerless, Old Pals Thatcher and Reagan Sip Tea, Reminisce</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Not long ago, Margaret Thatcher rolled out the red
carpet at 10 Downing St. for Ronald Reagan. But on Thursday the two
old and now powerless pals just had a cup of tea at his hotel.
   Then Reagan had to hurry off to Downing Street to see the prime
minister, John Major, and Mrs. Thatcher headed back to suburban
London where she moved last week after her ouster in a governing
Conservative Party revolt.
   ``They reminisced about their years together,'' said Reagan's
spokesman, Mark Weinberg. ``They have many, many memories of their
years in office. And they talked about what it is like to have been
in office and then return to private life, and about current world
affairs.''
   Reagan, on a four-day British visit, had been scheduled to see
Mrs. Thatcher at Downing Street - just like so many previous times
when their great friendship made the U.S.-British relationship more
special than at any time since World War II.
   Instead, the 65-year-old ex-prime minister showed up at
Claridges Hotel in a chauffeur-driven Jaguar. A dozen passersby
stopped to clap and wave.
   She was a few minutes behind four police escort vehicles. But
they were for someone else, a visiting president from one of
Africa's tiniest nations, Dawda Jawara of Gambia.
   When Reagan's second term was drawing to a close in 1988, Mrs.
Thatcher laid on a magnificent farewell with motorcades and
fanfares for a ceremony in the splendid setting of London's ancient
Guildhall.
   She hailed him as the president who restored the American dream;
he called her ``an inspiration to the world.''
   But when British leaders, who have no fixed terms, fall, it is
swift with no time for farewells.
   So the pair who governed through the 1980s met again with a
handshake and a kiss before a clutch of photographers outside the
hotel's second floor royal suite. Reagan, his wife, Nancy, and Mrs.
Thatcher then headed in for tea.
   Reagan lauded Mrs. Thatcher, the fellow conservative who stood
with him in the days of Cold War, saying, ``I salute you.''
   At Downing Street, Reagan arrived just as visting Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir was leaving. And he came out with Major
when the new British leader spoke to reporters to welcome Iraq's
decision to release Western hostages.
   A Downing Street spokeswoman said Reagan and Major spent about
45 minutes together. ``It was extremely amiable,'' she said.
   Earlier, the 79-year-old former president and his wife made the
royal rounds, lunching with Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace
after a meeting with the Queen Mother at nearby Clarence House.
   The queen, who gave Reagan an honorary knighthood in 1989, came
out to meet him, apologizing that her husband, Prince Philip, had
been delayed by fog on his way home from Australia.
   The Reagans are due to return to Los Angeles on Saturday.

<HEAD>Masterpiece Paintings, Stolen in 1985, Returned to Paris</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nine paintings that vanished in a brazen 1985
theft, including the Monet masterpiece that gave impressionism its
name, returned to Paris on Thursday after police found them in a
Corsican villa.
   Police said recovery resulted in part from information gathered
from gangsters in Japan.
   ``It's the best Christmas present we could have,'' said Arnaud
d'Hauterives, curator of the Marmottan Museum.
   He said Claude Monet's ``Impression Sunrise'' and the other
works might be ready for re-display at the Marmottan by the end of
the month after specialists treated them for damage caused by
humidity.
   D'Hauterives joined Culture Minister Jack Lang in praising the
persistence of a special police art theft unit, headed by
Commissioner Mireille Balestrazzi.
   Balestrazzi, one of the highest-ranking women in the national
police force, said the key breakthrough in the case came during a
1987 trip to Japan to bring home four paintings by Camille Corot
that had been stolen in 1984 from a museum in eastern France.
   She said her team learned that a Japanese collector had been
considering the purchase of one of the nine Marmottan works,
although the transaction did not take place.
   She said additional information was obtained through contacts
with the ``yakuza,'' or members of Japan's organized crime network.
Some of the gangsters were approached by representatives of the
thieves, she said, but refused to get involved.
   Balestrazzi provided few other details about the five-year
investigation. Authorities said one man had been arrested in
Corsica and about a dozen other people had been questioned, but
they indicated that the thieves themselves remained at large.
   The nine paintings from the Marmottan, along with an
as-yet-unidentified 17th century painting, were found Tuesday in a
villa in Porto-Vecchio in southern Corsica.
   Balestrazzi said the theft was committed solely in hopes of
profit and was in no way linked to any of Corsica's militant
separatist movements.
   She said the works were in good condition, although a few had
suffered slightly from humidity. Experts were to conduct a thorough
examination to assess their condition.
   Five armed, masked men carried out the theft on a Sunday morning
in October 1985, getting away easily because the Marmottan's alarm
system had been disconnected the previous night.
   About 30 visitors and nine guards were held at bay by the
gunmen. They were in the museum for only about 10 minutes, and
drove away after putting the paintings in the trunk of a car.
   The stolen paintings included five Monets, two by Pierre Auguste
Renoir and one by Berthe Morisot, as well as a portrait of Monet.
Their total value was estimated at the time at $12 million, but one
official described ``Impression Sunrise'' as priceless.
   The 1872 work shows the port at Le Havre in a mixture of blues
and browns, with an orange sun shining through the morning fog. It
was first displayed in 1874, and derisive critics dismissed it as
``impressionist.''

   A burning, pilotless military jet plowed
into a classroom at a suburban high school Thursday, killing 12
students, officials said. Many survivors jumped from upper windows
and were among the 87 injured.
   The pilot of the Italian air force jet had been trying to land
his disabled plane in fields near the school, and ejected minutes
before the crash, Gen. Carlo Brandini said. The pilot suffered
injuries.
   Some survivors, engulfed by heavy smoke, were rescued from the
third floor by firemen on ladders.
   Police said 87 people suffered burns, broken bones or smoke
inhalation and were taken by ambulance or helicopter to hospitals
in Bologna. One fireman was hurt.
   At the time of the crash, 285 students, 28 teachers and four
monitors were at the Gaetano Salvemini vocational high School in
Casalecchio, three miles from Bologna, authorities said.
   ``I heard a lot of students screaming and I saw at least eight
of them jump in panic from the third floor,'' said Giovanna Degli
Esposti, who watched from her home in a nearby condominium complex.
   ``Luckily the firemen arrived in a few minutes.''
   She said it was recess time and some students were already
outside Gaetano Salvemini High School in Casalecchio, three miles
from Bologna.
   A paramilitary official said all 12 dead were students in the
classroom hit by the jet, which tore a 12-foot-wide hole in a wall
on the second floor of the three-story building.
   A teacher who was giving a German lesson to the 16 pupils in the
class was hospitalized in Parma, in critical condition with burns,
the officer said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Fireman Tonino Pavoni said he heard the cries of a girl in the
class who was trapped under wreckage of a wing, and pulled her
free.
   The girl, Federica Tacconi, 16, suffered a crushed pelvis, said
ANSA.
   ``The German lesson was almost over. The teacher was giving us
homework. I heard a very loud noise, I saw the airplane come down,
then it was the end of the world. I found myself on the floor, in
pain, and now I'm here,'' ANSA quoted her as saying from her
hospital bed.
   Brandini said the plane was on a mission to test the
effectiveness of an anti-aircraft radar system and had taken off
from Villafranca military airport near Verona, 55 miles north of
Bologna.
   He said the Macchi 326 trainer was flying at about 280 mph when
trouble developed in its single engine, which then burst into
flames.
   Brandini said the pilot ejected ``according to regulations.'' He
identified the pilot as 2nd Lt. Bruno Viviani and said Viviani
first thought he could make an emergency landing at Bologna's
airport.
   ``When he saw he couldn't do it, he directed the plane toward an
open area. If the plane had cleared the school, it would have
crashed in...open fields,'' Brandini said from air force
headquarters in Rome.
   ANSA quoted a student as saying, ``I was in class and saw
through a window this low-flying plane coming at us and only had
time to say `This is crazy.''' The 24-year-old pilot suffered
fractured vertebrae and was questioned by a prosecutor in the
hospital, ANSA said.
   Brandini said the plane was flying low when the pilot ejected,
but he didn't know the exact altitude. A helicopter, alerted to the
pilot's distress, was following the jet and rescued the pilot after
he parachuted to safety.
   The Italian-produced jet, a two-seater, had only the pilot was
aboard, Brandini said. The plane, which has been purchased by
several other countries' military forces, has a wingspan of 35 feet
and can be used for training or for attack.
   In addition to the prosecutor's office, a military commission is
investigating the crash.
   Opposition parliamentarian Filippo Berselli demanded the
government explain why a military jet was on a training mission
over a populated area.

   A country music fan was in hog heaven
after a bath with steaming noodles and a 6-month-old pig won her
tickets to see her favorite star.
   ``I'm a big Clint Black fan,'' said Karen Herring, who wallowed
Wednesday in a noodle-filled bathtub for 30 minutes.``I just wanted
to go see him.''
   Ms. Herring, 38, came up with the idea for the stunt after
Jackson country music station WJDX held a contest offering free
tickets to see Black Thursday night at the Mississippi Coliseum.
   Listeners were asked what they would do for the tickets.
   Ms. Herring's proposal was the most unusual one, disc jockey
Scott Mateer said. ``We felt this was the most daring, most
creative thing she could do,'' he said.
   So while about 100 people looked on, Ms. Herring, clad in a
French maid's costume, plunged into the bathtub with a pig named
Clint.
   ``She's crazy,'' said her 15-year-old daughter, Mindy.
   ``Is this a crazy town or what?'' spectator David Grayson asked.

<HEAD>AU Trustees Rescind $1 million Offer to Berendzen</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The trustees of American University voted
unanimously Thursday to rescind its controversial offer to pay
nearly $1 million to buy out the contract of former president
Richard Berendzen, who pleaded guilty to making obscene telephone
calls.
   Berendzen had asked the trustees to withdraw the offer after he
was offered a chance to return as a full professor on the physics
faculty in the spring of 1992.
   That agreement puts Berendzen, 51, on administrative leave with
pay at his faculty salary for the 1990-91 academic year and the
fall 1991 semester. His annual salary would be in the range of
$70,000, officials said.
   He has continued to draw his annual salary of about $140,000
since resigning as president in April.
   Berendzen, named president in 1980, pleaded guilty to making
obscene telephone calls to a woman from his office. Two 30-day jail
terms were suspended in lieu of psychiatric treatment.
   Students, faculty and staff members representing various groups
were harshly critical of the proposed $1 million settlement.
   Although Edward Carr, chairman of the trustees, declined to
discuss specifics, the initial buyout offer reportedly would have
reached $1 million, including more than $600,000 in appreciation
for Berendzen's contributions in raising the school's image and
prestige.
   Carr said that agreement would not affect severance payments to
Berendzen provided for in his presidential contract. Carr estimated
the amount at slightly less than $400,000.
   Carr said the trustees supported the agreement allowing
Berendzen to return to teaching.
   Gayle Abbott, president of the school's Alumni Association, said
her group felt ``that the best interests of American University
mandate that A.U. sever all ties'' with Berendzen.''
   Abbott urged that Berendzen not be allowed to return as a member
of the faculty.
   Betty Bennett, dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, said
originally the deans did not support Berendzen returning to teach.
   ``If he does decide to return, then we will welcome him back ...
and we would take it from there,'' she said.

<HEAD>Dallas Votes Saturday On Changing City Council Structure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRI LANGFORD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters in the nation's eighth largest city are
divided over a referendum designed to help minorities win seats on
the City Council.
   Supporters of the proposal to create single-member districts say
the plan would help ease racial inequities that make it difficult
for minorites to get elected.
   Opponents say the referendum would actually re-segregate Dallas.
They back a plan voters approved last year that called for some
candidates to be elected by district, others by region and one at
large for the 11-member council.
   The referendum, up for vote Saturday, has heightened existing
racial tension in the ethnically diverse city, community leaders
said.
   ``To some, this election represents the last chance for peace in
Dallas,'' said Roy Williams, one of two former City Council
candidates who sued the city over its election system, saying it
was discriminatory.
   ``It would be a serious mistake for the city to ignore the
warning signs - widespread frustrations and cynicism in the
community,'' Williams said.
   Under the existing system instituted in 1975, eight council
members are elected in individual districts and another three,
including the mayor, are elected by voters citywide.
   The system voters approved by a 2-1 margin in August 1989 called
for 10 candidates to be chosen by district, four by region and one
at large. That system was never implemented because a federal judge
suggested he would rule it unconstitutional.
   The system proposed in the referendum calls for the creation of
14 single-member districts, with a mayor elected at large.
   The referendum is being held as part of the settlement of the
1988 federal lawsuit brought by Williams and Marvin Crenshaw, who
failed in their at-large council bids.
   The men, who are both black, charged the existing election
system made it difficult for minorities to win election.
   Black and Hispanic leaders nationwide have long charged that
at-large elections dilute minority candidates' political power and
make it difficult for them to win office.
   They maintain minorities have a better chance of winning office
under a political system in which candidates are elected by
individual districts.
   The city proposed the referendum on the newest plan when it
reached a settlement with Williams and Crenshaw in August.
   Although minorities are estimated to make up more than half the
city's population, only two of 11 City Council members are black,
and there are no Hispanics. Only one minority - a Hispanic who no
longer serves on the council - has won an at-large City Council
election.
   If a simple majority of voters approve the plan, a commission
will be set up to draw new district lines next year, using 1990
Census figures. Almost 17,000 of the city's 451,411 registered
voters cast absentee ballots as of Thursday.
   Former Dallas Cowboy quarterback Roger Staubach is among those
who support the change. ``You've got to look at where Dallas has
come and how it has treated the representation of minorities,''
Staubach said. ``It has not been fair.''
   Opponents include City Councilman Glenn Box, who said the plan
is a token quota system that re-segregates the city.
   ``We don't become an integrated city with 14-1,'' Box said.
   A poll The Dallas Morning News published last weekend indicated
voters were not unified on the issue.
   Half of the likely voters the newspaper contacted said they
would support the measure. Another 30 percent said they would vote
no and 20 percent were undecided.
   There have been no formal estimates of the city's racial makeup
since the 1980 census, when Dallas' 904,078 population was 61
percent white, 26 percent black and 12 Hispanic.
   The racial breakdown of the 1990 Census count of 982,250 people
is expected to show a majority black and Hispanic population.

<TEXT>
   Leftist radical Laura Whitehorn received a
20-year sentence Thursday for bombing the U.S. Capitol and
conspiring to set off seven other explosions that a prosecutor
called acts of terrorism.
   Whitehorn was sentenced along with co-defendant Linda Sue Evans,
who was ordered to serve five years for her role in the bombing
conspiracy after completing a 35-year term she is already serving
for illegally buying firearms.
   The two women, who pleaded guilty in a plea bargain Sept. 7,
were sentenced by U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene at a
proceeding punctuated by the cheers and applause of supporters who
packed the courtroom.
   ``You have committed acts of violence which are not excused by
good purposes or political purposes,'' Greene said. ``The effect of
these kinds of violence are just as devastating to the victims and
to society at large as if they were motivated by greed.''
   ``The defendants Linda Evans and Laura Whitehorn are
terrorists,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Margaret Ellen told the
judge. ``They are people who by their actions have sought to coerce
others by means of threats or violence.''
   The Nov. 7, 1983 bonb blast that blew a hole in the wall outside
the Senate chamber and the explosions at seven other locations in
Washington and New York City ``were not symbolic gestures; they
were distinct acts of terrorism,'' Ellen said.
   ``Only chance prevented serious harm'' to people, she said.
   Over boos of the defendants' supporters, she said, ``The
government has not and does not view these actions as political
crimes.''
   Evans' involvement in the bombing conspiracy was part of ``a
pattern of escalating violence'' that includes a 1987 conviction
for buying firearms and ammunition, Ellen said.
   FBI agents who raided a Baltimore apartment where Whitehorn and
Evans, 43, lived found components for more bombs and written plans
to set off explosives at other locations.
   Whitehorn, 45, who raised her right fist to greet supporters as
she entered the courtroom, described her involvment in what she
called a radical struggle against racism, militarism and oppression
of poor people.
   ``This government put us in a difficult position of choosing
between morality and the law,'' Whitehorn.
   ``How did Martin Luther King achieve progress without
violence?'' Greene asked at one point during the proceeding.
   ``The struggle of Martin Luther King is not divorced from other
struggles that because of necessity had incorporated violence,''
said defense attorney Nkechi Taifi. ``This whole country is built
upon violence,'' the lawyer said, evoking cheers and applause from
the crowd.
   Whitehorn received the maximum term for each of three charges to
which she pleaded guilty: conspiracy, malicious destruction of
government property and possession of equipment to make false
documents.
   In sentencing Evans, Greene said he was taking into account the
fact that she was already serving a 35-year prison term.
   Greene dismissed all charges against Susan Rosenberg and Timothy
Blunk, who are both serving 58 years for possession of explosives,
as part of the plea bargain. A Supreme Court ruling on double
jeopardy precluded their prosecution.
   Charges against Alan Berkman, who is undergoing chemotherapy for
Hodgkin's disease, will be dismissed at another, unscheduled,
proceeding.
   Another defendant, Marilyn Buck, was given a 10-year prison term
on Nov. 16 to run concurrently with a 60-year term she is serving
for other crimes.

   Elizabeth Taylor and an ex-beau reached an
out-of-court settlement Thursday in a battle over Passoon perfume
profits, ending what promised to be a revealing peek into the
star's personal life.
   Both sides agreed to drop their lawsuits in the middle of jury
selection. The judge announced the actress and former boyfriend
Henry Wynberg reached a settlement that leaves Miss Taylor in
control of the perfume line.
   Wynberg sued Miss Taylor for a share of $70 million in profits,
claiming she breached a contract with him to market the highly
popular fragrance.
   She had countered Wynberg's lawsuit with claims that his
criminal record led her to abandon their planned business deal and
turn to a major cosmetics company that began marketing Passion.
Miss Taylor won permission to tell jurors about Wynberg's statutory
rape conviction.
   Miss Taylor's lawyer, Neil Papiano, said no money would change
hands and each arty would pay its own legal expenses.
   ``It means I'm vindicated and it proves the perfume, Passion, is
something I worked for a year and a half for. ... It has nothing to
do with Henry Wynberg,'' Miss Taylor said afterward.
   Miss Taylor said she didn't relish the idea of being on the
witness stand, but didn't say that was the reason for reaching the
settlement.
   ``It's not like on television. It's not over in an hour. It's
not something I was looking forward to, but I was willing to fight
as long as I had to,'' she said.
   Wynberg said: ``I'm pleased it's all over with.''
   He said his decision wasn't based on fear a trial would reveal
too much about his criminal past.
   ``That turns out to be a two-way street. Anything they wanted to
ask of me we could have asked also of Elizabeth,'' Wynberg said.
   His lawyer, Quentin Kopp, refused to discuss how the settlement
came about or any details. They also refused to acknowledge that
Wynberg wouldn't receive any money.
   Attorneys had been negotiating for some time, but were unable to
reach agreement until Thursday, Papiano said.
   Jury selection had been under way for a day and a half,
highlighted Thursday by a prospective panelist's assertion that he
had seen most of the 58-year-old star's silent films, provoking
laughter in the packed courtroom.
   Under questioning by attorneys, a majority of potential
panelists said they have only vague memories of Miss Taylor as an
actress.
   Most said they best remember Miss Taylor as the child star of
``National Velvet.'' Two said they had never seen the Academy
Award-winning actress on film and one associated her with the
silent-film era, which predates her career.
   ``I go back to the silent movies, so I've seen most of her
films,'' the prospective panelist said when asked if he had ever
seen her on the screen.
   Miss Taylor, wearing a black dress and a thick gold necklace,
bracelet and earrings, reacted with a mock expression of horror,
then laughed along with others in the courtroom.
   Prospective jurors were asked about alcoholism, AIDS, what kind
of perfume they wear and their taste in television and movie
viewing habits.
   Miss Taylor's past bout with alcoholism was raised because
Wynberg claims her alcoholism and related weight gain destroyed the
glamorous image he counted on to market cosmetics under her name.
   The entire jury pool said they weren't biased by Miss Taylor's
work raising money for AIDS research.
   Wynberg is a former used car salesman who courted Miss Taylor
between her two marriages to Richard Burton in the 1970s.
   Wynberg and Miss Taylor said they had been hurt deeply by
personal attacks during the litigation. But Wynberg said they left
the courtroom as good friends.
   ``It's just like old times,'' he said.

   Here, at a glance, is some of the reaction to Saddam Hussein's
promise to free foreign hostages held in Iraq and Kuwait:
   ---
   President Bush welcomed Saddam's freedom promise but insisted
``the man must leave Kuwait without reservation, without
condition'' before the Gulf crisis can end.
   ---
   Secretary of State James Baker III told Congress that releasing
the hostages ``does not lessen, nor should it, our determination
that Iraq's aggression against Kuwait should be reversed.''
   ---
   Wall Street reacted with a brief rally and an initial sharp
plunge in oil prices. Bond prices, the dollar's value and gold all
fell.
   Oil prices dropped more than $2 a barrel, but ended with an
89-cent loss, closing at $26.40 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   The Dow Jones average finished down 7.92 points to 2,602.48. The
average had been up over 30 points in the first 15 minutes of
trading.
   ---
   Relatives reacted with joy and caution:
   ``There were times I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep,'' said
Doris Whatley of Shreveport, La. ``All of a sudden I am a changed
person ... because my husband is coming home.''
   ``The news is very welcome, but we're not throwing a
celebration,'' said Margaret Williams, whose son and
daughter-in-law are among ``human shields.'' ``We'll celebrate when
we see them coming out - and not before,'' she said from her home
in Germantown, Tenn.

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, unfazed by a spate of
bombing incidents that greeted his arrival here Thursday, hailed
Chile's peaceful transition to democracy and its pro-growth
economic policies.
   Bush received a generally friendly welcome on the first visit by
an American president in 30 years. He hailed Chile's ``democratic
renaissance'' and said ``Chile's return to the ranks of the world's
democracies is cause for pride and celebration.''
   But the bombings and other anti-American incidents were a
reminder that Chile has not yet escaped its fractious political
past.
   Before Bush arrived, leftist guerrillas exploded a half-dozen
bombs overnight at sites with U.S. ties, including four Mormon
chapels, a new McDonald's restaurant and a downtown park outside a
hotel where some officials in Bush's advance party were staying.
   The incidents, however, seemed designed more to make a political
statement than to cause harm. Police reported no injuries.
   The president's limousine was also hit by an egg thrown from the
crowd as his motorcade passed through Santiago streets.
   Police used tear gas and water cannon to scatter scores of
university students who threw rocks at police and blocked traffic
during a two-hour anti-Bush protest at a campus in the southern
section of the city. They burned at least two U.S. flags and waved
several Cuban flags.
   Later, shortly before Bush's arrival for a dinner at the
presidential palace, police dispersed demonstrators who were
shouting anti-American slogans.
   But generally the visit - Bush's fourth stop on a week-long
South American tour - went smoothly. At a colorful airport arrival
ceremony, at a news conference and at a speech to the national
congress, Bush heaped praise on Chile not only for its peaceful
return to democracy but its ability to generate economic growth
rates that are the envy of Latin America.
   Many Chileans have viewed the United States with suspicion and
hostility for years because of suggestions that the United States
subverted Chile's democracy in 1973, paving the way for 17 years of
military rule.
   With the restoration of freedom and economic growth, much of the
passion against the United States has dissipated.
   At the red-carpet welcome for Air Force One at the airport,
President Patricio Aylwin said, ``Mr. President, we welcome you
with joy.''
   ``We value your presence in our land. We share common ideals,''
he said.
   Also on hand at the airport was former military ruler Gen.
Augusto Pinochet, who is still commander in chief of the army.
After shaking hands with Bush, the smiling Pinochet told reporters:
``I want to thank President Bush because he recognized that the
previous government encouraged free market policies.''
   It was the first time Pinochet met a visiting head of state
after handing over power last March.
   In his speech to the Congress in Valparaiso , Bush said that
Chile ``has moved farther, faster that any other nation in South
America toward real market reform.''
   He said there has been an increase of 15 to 20 per cent in the
value of exports in each of the last five years.
   One issue dividing the United States and Chile is a four-day
grape embargo imposed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
against Chile last year. Inspectors reportedly found two grapes
laced with cyanide in the hold of a ship in Philadelphia. Chilean
growers are demanding compensation for losses estimated at $330
million.
   The issue was taken up during Thursday's talks here.
   Bush said the FDA decision was based purely on health
considerations and was not intended to punish Chile.
   The Bush administration prefaced the visit by lifting sanctions
imposed during the dictatorship of Pinochet, who ousted Chile's
leftist president, Salvador Allende, in 1973.
   In late November, Washington allowed Chile back into the General
Preferences System, which grants tariff concessions to exports from
many countries. The move could mean a $100 million increase in
Chile's U.S. exports, according to Finance Minister Alejandro
Foxley.
   The Reagan administration excluded Chile from the tariff
preference system in 1988 to protest Pinochet's repression of the
Chilean labor movement.
   Last weekend, the administration lifted a ban on military aid
and the sale of military equipment imposed in 1976 to protest
alleged human rights violations in Chile. Bilateral relations
further deteriorated that year following the murder on a Washington
street of Orlando Letelier, a Chilean exile who was an arch foe of
military rule in Chile.
   The United States has said that Chilean security officers were
responsible for the incident, in which an associate of Letelier's,
Ronni Moffitt, also died.
   Aylwin, speaking at the news conference with Bush, promised ``a
full clarification of truth and justice'' in the case.

<HEAD>Dry Weather Prevails With Rain and Snow in Some Areas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Dry weather prevailed Thursday across most of the nation, with
rain from Oklahoma to Missouri and snow lingering over Colorado and
western New York state.
   A cold front brought strong southerly winds to the south-central
sections of the United States and wind advisories for most of Texas
and Oklahoma.
   Strong, gusty winds also developed over parts of Southern
California, including the Tehachapi Mountains in Kern County.
   High temperatures ranged from the 20s in Colorado, Wyoming,
Minnesota, Wisconsin and upper Michigan, the 60s and 70s over
Florida and southern Texas and the lower 80s in Southern
California.
   The nation's low was 1 degree in McCall, Idaho.
   Flooding resulting from earlier heavy rains continued Thursday
in South Carolina and in portions of the Kankakee and Wabash rivers
in Indiana.
   Officials announced that record flooding in Washington state
last month ravaged wilderness areas in the state's western
sections, with damage to Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest
alone estimated at $12 million.
   The Wenatchee, Olympic and Gifford Pinchot forests also
suffered.
   Damage to roads, homes and businesses has been estimated at tens
of millions of dollars and some counties were declared federal
disaster areas. Two men died in Thanksgiving weekend floods.
   California farmers got some bad weather news Thursday.
   The state told farmers, who already face a grim water outlook as
California enters its fifth dry year, that they may get only
one-third of their scheduled supplies in 1991.
   ``This is not absolutely the worst case scenario, but it's close
to it,'' said Don Long, the state Department of Water Resources'
top water analyst.

<HEAD>Fugitive American John Hull Settling Down in Nicaragua</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DORALISA PILARTE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JUIGALPA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fugitive American linked to the
Iran-Contra scandal is building a new life in this provincial
capital with the support of some powerful patrons and former rebel
leaders.
   Hull fled neighboring Costa Rica in July 1989 after posting bail
following his arrest on charges of drug trafficking and ``hostility
to the security of the state of Costa Rica.''
   The last charge stems from his allegedly letting air strips at
his farms near the Nicaraguan border be used by the CIA to resupply
Contra rebels inside Nicaragua in 1984 and 1985.
   The U.S.-born Hull has been identified by federal prosecutors as
a point man in former National Security Council aide Oliver North's
efforts to funnel aid to Nicaraguan rebels. The program, which
turned into the Iran-Contra scandal, involved the selling of
weapons to Iran and the illegal diversion of proceeds to help
Nicaragua's Contra rebels. Since his arrival five months ago, Hull,
who is about 70, has been living in modest rented homes in Juigalpa
with his adopted daughter, Emily.
   Former top Contra leader Israel Galeano, known as ``Commander
Franklyn,'' said Hull is deciding whether to stay.
   ``We have known him for a long time, and he always has helped us
when we were in our most difficult moments,'' Galeano is quoted as
saying in Barricada, the official Sandinista newspaper.
   The Contras abandoned their war after the leftist Sandinistas
were voted out of ofiice and replaced by a U.S.-backed
administration earlier this year.
   Hull avoids the press. But in interviews with friends,
associates and neighbors, a picture of his new life has emerged.
   According to local officials, Hull intends to get involved in
cattle ranching, lumber exporting and citrus plantations.
   Nicaraguan officials say they have not received any extradition
requests from Costa Rican and that there are no charges against him
in Nicaragua.
   Costa Rica presented an extradition request to the United
States, where Hull initially fled after jumping bail. But Hull
vanished again, later turning up in Nicaragua.
   In Costa Rica, the Foreign Ministry has asked the Supreme Court
to change the extradition request from the United States to
Nicaragua.
   ``By pure chance I saw Hull (Tuesday) in Managua. He drove past
me in his pickup truck,'' said Carlos Aguilar, Costa Rica's
ambassador in Managua.
   Juigalpa Mayor Isaac DeLeo says he did not realize who Hull was
when he first met him.
   ``Some little time ago, he came here and he was introduced to me
by a gentleman from the Resistance, who said that Hull had
protected the boys and given them food when they were in Costa
Rica,'' said DeLeo.
   ``He said he wanted to buy a ranch in Chontales and that he has
a friend from California who wants to set up a shoe factory here.''
   In addition to his links to resupplying Contras, Hull has been
implicated in Costa Rica in the 1984 assassination attempt against
former Contra leader Eden Pastora.
   A bomb at a news conference at Pastora's jungle camp in La
Penca, Nicaragua, killed five people, including an American
journalist.
   ``He (Hull) said to me, `I swear I had absolutely nothing to do
with La Penca','' DeLeo said.
   Hull is one of 29 people named in a civil suit in the United
States filed over the bombing. The suit claims the bomb was the
work of the CIA.
   ``He's a very quiet man, very well educated and of few words,''
DeLeo said. ``I have no commitments with Mr. Hull, I only have
helped him look for housing.''
   Hull has also reportedly sponsored humanitarian donations,
earning the gratitute of Dr. Leonel Rosales, director of Juigalpa's
hospital.
   ``We all knew exactly who he was when he came here,'' Rosales
said. ``But I'm not interested in all that. If the devil comes to
donate medical materials - of if God comes - I'll take it and don't
ask questions.''
   In November, Hull introduced Dr. Verne Chaney, president of the
New York-based Dooley Foundation, to Rosales.
   Chaney was to bring two containers full of donations, including
X-ray and blood analysis machines, for a Contra clinic near the
Honduran border.
   ``Hull ... came back saying that he (Chaney) did not think that
place met the conditions for the machines to work,'' Rosales said.
``Then Hull said the donations would instead be given to our
hospital.''

   A Bensonhurst defendant whose first murder trial
ended with a hung jury was acquitted Thursday of murder and
manslaughter in the racially motivated slaying of a black youth.
   John Vento, 22, was found guilty only of riot. He was the third
defendant acquitted of major charges this week.
   As the verdict was read, the defendant banged his hands on the
defense table and screamed, ``Yes, yes, yes!'' Vento, crying, then
grabbed and hugged his lawyer before he was restrained by court
officers.
   The jury in state Supreme Court returned the verdict during the
second full day of deliberations. The riot conviction carries a
maximum term of one and one-third to four years in prison.
   He faced 25 years to life in prison if convicted on the murder
charge.
   ``It's always hard to convict someone when he was not the
triggerman,'' said Assistant District Attorney Paul Burns. ``This
jury was a smart jury, and I have absolutely no criticism of their
verdict whatsoever.''
   ``All I will tell you is it was a very, very difficult case and
a very difficult decision,'' said juror Gay Fallows, reached by
telephone.
   The trial was the second for Vento, the former star prosecution
witness turned defendant. Vento backed out of a deal to testify
against his friends after he and his family received threats.
   In July, a jury convicted Vento of unlawful imprisonment and
menacing, but acquitted him of the most serious charge he faced,
intentional murder. The panel deadlocked on a second murder count
and riot. A few weeks later he was also indicted on second-degree
manslaughter.
   He is serving a sentence of up to eight years in prison for the
convictions.
   Prosecutors described Vento as a major participant in the Aug.
23, 1989, slaying of Yusuf Hawkins in the Bensonhurst section of
Brooklyn. Hawkins, 16, was in the predominantly white neighborhood
to look at a used car. He was cornered by a gang of whites and
fatally shot in the chest.
   ``He was there, he helped organize and recruit a mob,''
Assistant District Attorney Paul Burns said of Vento. ``He was
there when the mob armed itself and he was there as one of the
leaders of the mob.''
   Defense attorney Gerald J. DiChiara defended Vento as a young
man drawn into what he thought would be a brawl to protect his
friend Keith Mondello and to keep outsiders from his neighborhood.
   ``Kids fight. Kids who are 17 and up who hang out at
luncheonettes and candy stores fight, but they're not murderers,''
DiChiara said.
   He argued that Joseph Fama, who has been convicted of murder in
the case, acted alone and that there was no evidence proving Vento
shared the killer's mental culpability.
   Prosecutors did not say Vento shot Hawkins, but maintained that
in helping Fama corner and then shoot the teen-ager he acted in
concert with the shooter and was equally guilty of murder.
   In the weeks following the shooting, Vento agreed to cooperate
with prosecutors in exchange for immunity and appeared before a
grand jury.
   He subsequently backed out of the deal and fled the city after
the threats against his family, DiChiara said. Vento surrendered in
Ohio, but opted to face a trial rather than resume his cooperation.
   Fama, convicted of murder and other crimes, is serving 32 and
two-thirds years to life. Mondello, the organizer of the mob, was
acquitted of murder and manslaughter, but was sentenced to up to 16
years in prison for his conviction on several leser crimes.
   Three other defendants are scheduled to stand trial early next
year for their alleged roles in the slaying.

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saddam Hussein told his parliament Thursday
to free all foreign hostages in response to ``positive changes'' in
the Persian Gulf crisis, and he said Iraq should apologize to the
thousands who were held.
   Baghdad wants all the hostages released and home by Christmas,
Iraq's U.N. ambassador said Thursday.
   ``Definitely, we would like to see everyone with his family by
Christmas, because that is a very joyous and happy occasion, and it
is time for family reunions,'' Ambassador Abdul Amir al-Anbari said
at the U.N. headquarters.
   There are an estimated 900 U.S. hostages among the thousands
held by the Iraqis in Iraq and Kuwait in the aftermath of Iraq's
Aug. 2 invasion of the neighboring oil-rich emirate.
   Their release could begin as early as Saturday, Iraqi officials
said late Thursday, though processing of visa applications and
other papers could take days.
   Saddam said the reason for holding foreigners - to deter an
attack - had diminished. He also said Iraqi troops had been given
the time to become battle ready.
   The Iraqi leader also noted there had been growing opposition in
the United States to President Bush's efforts to form a consensus
for military action to dislodge Iraq from Kuwait.
   The 250-seat National Assembly, which routinely backs the ruling
Baath party leader, scheduled a meeting for 11 a.m. Friday.
   If it approves Saddam's proposal as expected, it would be the
first time Iraq has agreed to abide by a U.N. Security Council
resolution on the crisis sparked by Iraq's invasion.
   President Bush welcomed the announcement but said Saddam should
not have taken people hostage in the first place. And Bush
insisted: ``The man must leave Kuwait without reservation, without
condition'' before the standoff can end.
   Iraq holds thousands of foreigners, whom it refers to as
``guests.'' Some 600 of them - mainly Americans, Britons and
Japanese - have been moved to strategic military and industrial
sites to serve as human shields to ward off military action.
   Saddam said the foreigners were people ``who do not want to
fight'' and who got ``trapped in the space between the two
trenches.''
   In all, there are an estimated 950,000 foreigners in Iraq and
occupiedKuwait, but Saddam earlier said most Asians and Arabs -
the majority of the foreigners - were free to leave.
   There was a spontaneous celebration Thursday at the Al-Mansour
Melia Hotel in downtown Baghdad, where several hostages were
brought to meet with visiting family members.
   ``We did it at last and now we can go home for Christmas,'' said
Susan Dring, who traveled to Baghdad last week to try to win her
husband's freedom.
   Michael Dring stood behind her, celebrating with a can of
imported beer.
   Saddam's decision coincided with a report that his foreign
minister, Tariq Aziz, will meet with Bush in Washington on Dec. 17
to discuss a possible settlement of the crisis.
   Bush had said he would receive Aziz during the week of Dec. 10,
then dispatch Secretary of State James A. Baker III to Baghdad.
   The announcement also came as a source in Paris said ambassadors
of the five permanent members of the Security Council - including
the United States - had agreed on a resolution seeking an
international peace conference on the Middle East.
   Since 10 days after the invasion, Saddam has stressed a linkage
of other Middle East problems, particularly the Israeli occupation
of Palestinian lands in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, to a
withdrawal from Kuwait.
   The United States rejects such a linkage, insisting that Iraq
withdraw from Kuwait before the Arab-Israeli conflict is discussed.
   In his letter to parliament speaker Sadi Mehdi Saleh, Saddam
said his decision was prompted by recent consultations with his
``Arab brothers,'' a reference to a meeting Tuesday with King
Hussein of Jordan, PLO chief Yasser Arafat and Yemeni Vice
President Ali Salem al-Beidh.
   Saddam said ``the reason for which the foreigners were prevented
from travel have diminished and has been replaced by something more
powerful - a change in the American public opinion which will
impose restrictions on the decisions and intentions of the evil
ones, led by Bush, the enemy of God.''
   Iraq stopped foreigners from leaving in response to a U.S.-led
multinational troop buildup in Saudi Arabia and the gulf region
which followed the occupation of Kuwait.
   About 400,000 soldiers have been deployed in the multinational
force. The United States alone has 250,000 and nearly 200,000 more
on their way.
   The Security Council told Saddam last week that he must leave
Kuwait by Jan. 15 or face a military onslaught. That resolution,
the 12th against Iraq since the crisis erupted, also demanded that
he free all hostages.
   Saddam told Saleh the foreigners were interned to ``delay war''
and provide Iraqi forces with enough time to prepare for a possible
war over Kuwait.
   Now that the Iraqi military is battle ready, Saddam said, the
foreigners should regain their ``freedom to travel.''
   ``We deem it necessary that our National Assembly convene to
take a final and irrevocable stand toward a humanitarian issue,''
he said.
   He referred to his earlier offer to allow the foreigners to
leave between Dec. 25 and March 25, which is the most likely period
for an attack to drive Iraq from Kuwait.
   He added that recent overtures prompted him to ``respond to
positive changes.''
   Among the positive changes, he cited a drive within the United
States to avert war and give sanctions imposed on Iraq more time.
Several witnesses appearing before Congress this week have urged
caution.
   Saddam referred briefly to Bush's offer for talks with Iraq.
   ``Bush's calls for dialogue are still concealing war intentions
and we must be aware not to fall into such traps,'' he said.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel rejected
Thursday the idea of an international Mideast peace conference, and
he vowed to ask Washington about reports it is backing the idea at
the United Nations.
   Shamir labeled as ``rumors'' the reports that the United States
will ask the U.N. Security Council to consider convening the peace
conference.
   In a speech at a Joint Israel Appeal fundraising dinner, Shamir
also reassured Israel's supporters that the country is ready to
deal with threats by Iraq's leader. Saddam Hussein has said Israel
would be the first target in any Persian Gulf conflict.
   ``Saddam Hussein must surely know that if he resorts to violent
action against Israel, he will pay dearly for such action,'' Shamir
said.
   ``The days when people could attack defenseless Jews with
impunity are over. This is what Israel is all about.''
   About 6 million Jews were killed in the Nazi Holocaust.
   The Israeli leader, who is on nine-day trip to Britain and the
United States, noted that his country is not part of the
multinational force opposing Iraq in the gulf.
   ``But by our very presence in that area - thanks to our
steadfastness and capacity - we have been, and continue to be, a
force for stability, a barrier that has prevented many military
adventures and muand in a civil clomplaint charged Cartisano and his
Challenger V Foundation with violation of five Hawaii laws.
   The complaint said Challenger V violates child welfare licensing
laws, compulsory school attendance laws, operates without a
business license and is avoiding state taxes, is an unlicensed
practice of psychology and has engaged in unfair and deceptive
trade practices.
   Tom Farrell, Hawaii's assistant attorney general, said he
believed Cartisano was with the teen-agers either near Kona on
Hawaii Island or floating in the seas.
   Repeated telephone messages left with Challenger V's answering
service in Honolulu were not returned.
   Cartisano's wife, Debbie, said Wednesday her husband is in
Guadalajara, Mexico, where he is attempting to set up another
wilderness therapy program. She said she had no way of contacting
him.
   The Utah program, founded in 1988 by Stephen Cartisano, sought
Chapter 11 protection this summer. State officials say it owed more
than $279,000 in federal and state taxes. A creditors' hearing
showed the program owed more than $1.1 million and had assets of
about $260,000; the program claimed assets of $63,000.
   Cartisano, 33, and his company are awaiting trial in May on
charges of negligent homicide and child abuse in connection with
the hiking death June 27 of Kristen Chase. Athorities closed down
the program in August.
   An offshoot of a popular wildrness program offered at Brigham
Young University in the 1970s, Cartisano claimed therapeutic value
in forcing unruly teen-agers to cope and succeed in an unforgiving
environment.
   In Utah, Challenger charged $16,000 for the 63-day program,
which many parents swore by, including the mother of the dead
teen-ager.
   Mrs. Cartisano accused Hawaii officials of pursuing a vendetta
passed on by Utah officials.
   ``They called over here with all that gossip,'' she said.
   She said company attorneys told them that Challenger V is
operating legally. She declined to name the lawyers.
   ``Those people (in Hawaii) haven't had any complaints,'' she
said. ``There's no reason to be doing these things.''

<HEAD>Food Aid Pours In, But Moscow's Real Need: Empty Bottles</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with additional shipments received,
distributed, SPECIFIES metric tons. No pickup.</NOTE>

   While government officials squabbled Thursday over
who was to blame for Moscow's food shortages, a Soviet Foreign
Ministry spokesman reported that humanitarian aid from abroad had
topped $160 million.
   But if Western nations really want Muscovites to have a happy
holiday season, they should send empty bottles. A shortage of the
glass containers threatens to leave the city without vodka, wine
and champagne to toast the New Year.
   In the latest round of finger-pointing over shortages in Moscow
that have raised fears of a hungry winter, authorities from regions
that supply the capital with meat, milk and other foodstuffs denied
they are withholding stocks.
   There is ``no need to start a witch-hunt where there are no
witches,'' said V. Syrovatko, an official of the Bryansk region
southwest of Moscow, in an interview published in Thursday's
Sovietskaya Rossiya newspaper.
   Last month, Moscow Deputy Mayor Sergei B. Stankevich accused the
regions of Bryansk, Penza and other areas of violating delivery
contracts to the capital.
   A. Kovlyagin, executive committee chairman of the Penza regional
council, said his region fulfilled its delivery plans by 97 percent
the past 10 months. He said Penza supplied 18,087 metric tons of
meat, of the contracted 19,463 metric tons, and either surpassed or
nearly met all its dairy contracts, the newspaper reported.
   The neighboring Tver region sent 347 metric tons o meat to
Moscow, exceeding the state plan of 275 metric tons, Sovietskaya
Rossiya said.
   Kovlyagin blamed any shortages on Moscow city officials for
failing to establish contact with regional authorities, it
reported.
   Moscow's milk supply is down 15 to 20 percent the last 11
months, Soviet television reported Thursday. It said 20,000 metric
tons of powdered milk is being sent to the capital.
   Soviet officials say food production is no lower than last year,
including a record grain harvest this year. Many blame barren store
shelves on a crumbling distribution system and panicked consumers.
   Many regions halted shipments of food and consumer goods to
other areas to protest Kremlin policies. Rather than obey central
government demands for food deliveries to the cities at state
prices they consider too low, farmers are trading directly with
factories and other consumers for other scarce supplies.
   Aid from abroad kept arriving Thursday. The second of two
Israeli jetliners filled with fruit, vegetables, medicine and 15
metric tons of powdered milk arrived in Moscow Thursday night.
   The powdered milk was trucked from the airport to Khimkenskaya
Hospital in Moscow and to Soltikovsky Children's Home outside the
city, officials said.
   About 20 metric tons of food arrived Thursday from the United
States, Tass said, without specifying who sent it. Leningrad
received more than 12 metric tons and Moscow 17 metric tons from
Germany, Tass said.
   More shipments were announced from Norway and Germany on
Thursday, officials in those countries said.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vitaly Churkin told a briefing $160
million worth of food has been sent to this country or is in the
pipeline. He said governments and charitable organizations from 21
nations have promised or delivered aid.
   Tass said any information about distribution of foreign food aid
may be directed to the government commission responsible for
overseeing the shipments, headed by Deputy Prime Minister Lev
Voronin.
   By Dec. 15, more than 200,000 food parcels, each weighing 22
pounds, will start arriving here, containing such items as milk,
macaroni, meat, vegetables and fruit, Churkin said.
   Churkin said Spain, Italy, France and Canada offered financial
aid for food purchases, and negotiations are under way with
Austria, Britain, Australia, Greece, South Korea, Turkey, Saudi
Arabia and Iran.
   He praised Tuesday's comments in Britain by former President
Ronald Reagan, who called Mikhail S. Gorbachev a ``friend in need''
and said the West must offer assistance.
   But the newspaper Moskovskaya Pravda said Moscow's latest need
is empty bottles - half-liter containers, preferably - to hold
holiday spirits.
   The city faces a ``dry'' New Year because consumers are not
returning empties, though stores now pay about 90 cents a bottle,
more than twice the usual price. The newspaper did not say why
people apparently are holding onto the bottles. Some stores won't
sell a bottle of wine or vodka unless the buyer surrenders an
empty.
   One reason for the shortage is that bottle production was
curtailed during Gorbachev's anti-alcohol campaign three years ago.
   Although some enterprises will fill jars with wine or vodka,
Moskovskaya Pravda suggested the practice ``won't look nice on the
holiday table.''

<HEAD>Daughters of King and Malcolm X to Visit Arizona</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The daughters of slain civil rights leaders
Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X have decided to keep a
commitment to perform a musical play at the University of Arizona,
a minister said.
   The Rev. Warren Stewart of Phoenix said Yolanda King and
Attallah Shabbazz will perform the play Sunday.
   Arizona voters rejected a referendum that would have created a
paid state holiday honoring King. The Nov. 6 vote triggered a
backlash against the state, including a recommendation by National
Football League Commissioner Paul Tagliabue to move the 1993 Super
Bowl out of Arizona.
   The play, ``Stepping Into Tomorrow,'' was booked months before
the general election, said Jesse Hargrove, the university's
assistant dean of African-American Student Affairs.
   Stewart, pastor of the First Institutional Baptist Church, said
Ms. King called him Monday to ask his advice.
   ``Some people were telling her to come and some were telling her
to stay away and to boycott Arizona. She said she wanted to be a
pro-active force rather than a reactive force, and I told her that
coming at this time could contribute to the healing of the state,''
Stewart said.
   Ms. King, 34, would not discuss the controversy.
   ``She wants to make a prepared statement Sunday in order to be
fair to everyone,'' publicist Jahna Cole said Wednesday.
   Ms. Shabbazz was on tour Wednesday and could not be reached for
comment. Ms. King, who lives in Los Angeles where she is pursuing
an acting career, was 12 years old when her father was assassinated
in 1968.
   Since the Nov. 6 election, five organizations have canceled
conventions that would have brought a total of about $7.1 million
to the state, said Larry Hilliard, vice president of the Phoenix
Convention and Visitors Bureau.
   The Harlem Globetrotters basketball troupe also canceled an
appearance.
   The Phoenix Gazette reported Thursday that acting Gov. Rose
Mofford may ask the Legislature in January for temporary authority
to declare a paid King holiday by executive order.
   The newspaper, quoting an unidentified source, said the holiday
would be referred to Arizona voters in 1992 under Mofford's
proposal.
   Then-Gov. Evan Mecham stirred controversy in 1987 when he
rescinded a paid King holiday declared by his predecessor, Bruce
Babbitt, by executive order. Attorney General Bob Corbin had said
Babbitt lacked the authority to declare the holiday.
   Mofford and key aides left Wednesday for Washington and planned
a private meeting Friday with Tagliabue to discuss the Super Bowl.
   ``We'll certainly discuss things with him, and I'm sure he'll
listen to what we have to say,'' Mofford said.

   Investigators used a DC-9 on Thursday to
retrace the misguided route taken by one of two jets that crashed
and killed eight people on a runway at Detroit Metropolitan
Airport.
   National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Brent Bahler said
the walkthrough in the same kind of plane involved in the accident
was among the final steps in the agency's investigation.
   ``We've gotten to the point where the factual part of this is
starting to wind down. Now it's all analyzing the data,'' Bahler
said.
   As with other investigations of fatal crashes, a final NTSB
report could take up to a year.
   Eight people were killed and 24 injured Monday when a
Pittsburgh-bound Northwest Airlines DC-9, carrying 39 passengers
and four crew members, wandered through thick fog into the path of
a Northwest Boeing 727 roaring toward takeoff. None of the 727's
145 passengers and eight crew were injured.
   Earlier Thursday, investigators in a car videotaped the route
the DC-9 took that put it on runway 3-C, where it was clipped by
the Memphis, Tenn.-bound 727.
   The 727's right wing gored the right side of the DC-9 from just
behind the cockpit, knocking off one of the DC-9's aft engines and
igniting jet fuel.
   NTSB investigator John Lauber said the second walkthrough was
ordered ``primarily to get ... all taxiway markings, runway
markings, the lights, the signs: all the relevant ground markings''
from the DC-9 pilot's point of view.
   Lauber said investigators had gathered data on the runways and
taxiways involved and from interviews with crew members of both
planes and other pilots working Monday.
   ``We wouldn't, at this stage, rule out anything,'' he told
reporters at the group's final news briefing before wrapping up
work at the suburban Detroit airport.
   Wednesday, Milio Rinna, a passenger on the DC-9, filed suit
against Northwest in Wayne County Circuit Court. It was the first
lawsuit filed against the airline following Monday's accident.
   Rinna, a 60-year-old health and safety official with the United
Steelworkers, suffered burns and other injuries to his hands, head
and knees. He was treated and released at a hospital, said his
lawyer, William L. Martens.
   About 140 lawsuits were filed against Northwest and airplane
manufacturer McDonnell Douglas Corp. after Northwest Flight 255
crashed at Detroit Metro on Aug. 16, 1987, killing 156.
   About 12 cases were settled before trial, and payouts have
totaled about $150 million, ranging between $300,000 and $5 million
apiece.

<TEXT>
   Members of the 32-nation Antarctic
Treaty ended an 18-day meeting Thursday but failed to ban
exploitation of the vast, frozen continent's resources.
   The group did agree on a draft of guidelines for an
international agreement on the protection of the continent's
environment, said meeting president Oscar Pinochet, a Chilean. The
draft will be discussed in Madrid next April, he said.
   The document, written by Rolf Anderssen, head of the Norwegian
delegation, was not made public. But Pinochet said the issue of
exploitation of the southern continent's potentially rich
resources, including oil, was not included.
   Pinochet said that while negotiations were continuing on the
issue of minerals extraction, ``a gentlemen's agreement'' remains
banning all mineral activities in Antarctica.
   Alternatives are to ban minerals extraction forever, which has
been proposed by Australia and several European nations including
France, or impose a long moratorium. Most member nations apparently
support the moratorium option but details must be worked out,
officials said.
   A communique issued at the end of the meeting in this Pacific
resort city said: ``The decision was made to prepare, as soon as
possible, a new international instrument for the protection of the
Antarctic environment, and negotiations have already begun.''
   ``The meeting showed that a consensus exists on the necessity of
protecting the Antarctic environment,'' the communique said.
   ``I'm convinced that we are going to have a protocol or a
convention for the protection of environment in Antarctica,'' said
Pinochet, who is not related to former ruler Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
   ``We will have it subscribed during the first half of 1992,'' he
predicted.

   The United States asked its NATO allies
Thursday for more help transporting, equipping, and reinforcing the
multinational force in the Persian Gulf, officials said.
   U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney was joined by Tom King, his
British counterpart, in welcoming the help given so far and urging
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies to provide still
more.
   The two officials made the appeals during the first day of a
two-day session of NATO defense ministers.
   Officials said Cheney also told the ministers a post-Cold War
NATO should focus on four potential threats to its security: the
Soviet Union as Europe's largest military power, political
instability in Eastern Europe, the spread of chemical arms and
ballistic missiles in the Middle East, and threats to Western
supplies of energy.
   King told reporters Britain wants its allies to provide more
ammunition, medical equipment and staff, chemical warfare gear, and
ships and planes to transport troops to the gulf.
   A senior Cheney aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the United States did not present a detailed list of its needs nor
did it ask for an immediate response.
   However, the aide said Cheney cited ``categories'' of assistance
that other officials described as air and sealift help and
protective gear for chemical warfare. He also said, ``The United
States would welcome such additional support as the allies could
supply,'' including troops.
   The aide said several nations ``indicated considerable ways in
which they might offer additional support.'' But there were no
details.
   The United States has almost 300,000 troops in the gulf region.
About 100,000 more U.S. troops are now being sent, and Britain is
bringing its deployment to 30,000 over the next few weeks.
   A NATO official termed ``very good news'' an Iraqi announcement
Thursday that President Saddam Hussein had called for releasing all
foreign hostages. The release could begin as early as Saturday and
is hoped to be completed by Christmas, Iraqi officials said.
   However, the NATO official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
also said Iraq ``must completely withdraw from Kuwait and restore
the legitimate government.''
   On other matters, the defense ministers reviewed work on a new
NATO defense strategy to reflect the dramatic changes in East-West
relations.
   The Cheney aide said the defense secretary told the allies NATO
no longer faced a ``single threat'' but a combination of dangers,
especially from an unstable Eastern Europe and turbulent Middle
East.
   ``Quite clearly the scale and nature of the threat has changed,
but there are considerable ... instabilities remaining, not least
the rise of nationalism'' in Eastern Europe, said King, the British
minister.
   The new defense strategy, to be adopted next year, will stress
greater reliance on smaller, more flexible multinational forces. It
will also commit the NATO allies to continue relying on a mix of
conventional and nuclear arms and to maintain a U.S. military
presence in Europe, though at a sharply reduced level.
   Officials said discussions continued about whether NATO should
operate as an alliance outside its own territory, a politically
sensitive issue in many allied capitals.
   German Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said a consensus had
emerged to rid Europe of short-range nuclear weapons.
   However, U.S. officials were more cautious. They stressed a need
for negotiations with Moscow on reducing, not eliminating these
weapons with a range of up to 310 miles.

<HEAD>Cellmate Says Accused Nurse Claimed Killing 23</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former nurse accused of killing a
nursing home patient with a tranquilizer told a cellmate he had
killed 23 people, pretrial documents show.
   Brian Rosenfeld, who has worked for at least 10 Pinellas County
nursing homes before his arrest in August, said he selected victims
who were about to die anyway, said the cellmate whose testimony was
inadvertently included in a packet of pretrial discovery material
made public Monday.
   David Allen Greenway, held at the Pinellas County Jail on a
grand theft charge, made the statements to sheriff's Detective
Chuck Vaughn.
   After a St. Petersburg Times reporter read an account of
Greenway's statements and asked for a copy, Assistant State
Attorney Marie King removed it from the packet, the newspaper
reported Wednesday. Confessions are not supposed to be released,
she said, and Greenway's statements had been included in the packet
by mistake.
   Greenway's testimony is crucial evidence linking Rosenfeld to
multiple deaths, Assistant State Attorney Fred Schaub said Tuesday.
Greenway knows things about Rosenfeld that weren't in any news
accounts, Schaub said.
   For example, Greenway said Rosenfeld told him the names of five
or six of his alleged victims. Schaub confirmed those nursing home
patients died while under Rosenfeld's care.
   Rosenfeld, 32, was helit shows that the strategy is working and that
Saddam understands that his hostage policy has incurred the
condemnation of the whole world, the president said.
   ``And we've got to continue to keep the pressure on,'' said
Bush, who has authorized the deployment of more than 400,000
Americans to the gulf.
   The Pentagon said Thursday that Iraq had moved an additional
30,000 troops into Kuwait and southern Iraq, and that 10,000 U.S.
reinforcements had arrived in the Persian Gulf.
   There are now more than 480,000 Iraqi troops in the region and
more than 250,000 American troops, including at least 130,000 U.S.
Army soldiers in Saudi Arabia.
   Bush said his planned meeting with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq
Aziz, and a meeting between Baker and Saddam, would not be
negotiating sessions in which concessions might be offered to Iraq.
   ``What I want to do is be sure, by going this last, extra step
for peace, that the Iraqis know from me, and Aziz knows from me and
Saddam Hussein knows directly from the secretary of state, what is
at stake in this matter and how supportive the United States is of
the consolidated U.N. position,'' Bush said. ``And that's what it's
about.''
   On Capitol Hill, Baker also rejected Iraqi demands that the
talks include discussion of other Mideast issues.

   A judge suspended a $300,000 bail Thursday for
the man accused of killing extremist Rabbi Meir Kahane and set new
bail arguments for Monday.
   State Supreme Court Justice Alvin Schlesinger set the bail
Wednesday for El Sayyid Nosair over Manhattan District Attorney
Robert Morgenthau's objections.
   ``We had asked that the defendant continue to be held without
bail,'' Morgenthau said. ``We pointed out to the court that he is
accused of committing a number of exceptionally serious crimes,
including both the murder of Rabbi Kahane and the wounding of a
federal police officer.''
   The judge's suspension of Nosair's bail means he would not be
freed even if he came up with the money, Morgenthau's spokesman
Gerald McKelvey said.
   Schlesinger said the bail issue will go back to court Monday.
   Morgenthau said bail should be revoked because the case against
Nosair is strong and because he has foreign contacts who could help
him flee.
   Nosair, 35, is accused of shooting the Zionist radical through
the neck Nov. 5 as Kahane finished speaking to a Jewish group in a
midtown hotel. He is also accused of wounding two other men and
threatening a third as he allegedly tried to get away.
   In a statement to police, attached to a disclosure form filed in
court, Nosair said he went to see Kahane's lecture because he
agrees with much of the rabbi's anti-Arab rhetoric.
   Nosair also told police he believes Kahane was shot by a Jewish
man. He said he was wounded when he was caught in the crossfire
between the killer and the U.S. Postal Service police officer who
fired a bullet into his neck.
   The gun police recovered and accused him of using on Kahane was
placed next to him as he lay wounded in the street, according to
Nosair's statement.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - Populist priest Jean-Bertrand
Aristide on Thursday blamed the Tonton Macoutes, the private
militia that terrorized the people during the Duvalier rule, for
killing seven people at a campaign rally.
   Fifty-three people were wounded in the Wednesday night gun and
bomb attack on his rally in Petionville, a suburb seven miles from
the capital.
   Aristide, considered front-runner in the Dec. 16 presidential
elections, said he and the 10 other candidates would not let such
violence derail the campaign.
   The attack appeared intended to keep Aristide supporters from
the polls. It was the first violence since campaigning began in
October and came as Haitians were optimistic they could hold the
first democratic elections in the history of the former French
colony.
   ``Take heart, dry your tears, hold one another's hands,''
Aristide said in an emotional interview with Radio Antilles. ``We
are going to continue walking together because on the 16th of
December, whether they like it or not, the Macoutes will disappear
from Haiti.''
   Aristide demanded the arrest of Roger Lafontant, reputed leader
of the Tonton Macoutes who returned from exile to run for
president. The independent Electoral Council, however, later
disqualified his candidacy.
   A warrant for Lafontant's arrest has never been served.
   Lafontant denied responsibility for Wednesday's violence.
   Interior Minister Joseph Maxi promised an investigation.
   The capital was quiet Thursday. Traffic was normal and people
went to work.
   Radio reports said schools closed early for the Christmas
holidays because of the attack. They were supposed to close Dec.
19.
   The attack came as the rally was breaking up, starting with the
explosion of a homemade bomb during a brief blackout. Men in a jeep
then fired into the crowd.
   Most of the injured treated at Port-au-Prince's General Hospital
suffered burns and bullet, shrapnel and shotgun pellet wounds. Some
had limbs amputated.
   ``Too bad for those who want war and not peace; we who defend
the rules of democracy, who refuse the language of violence, will
continue our struggle and go on with the electoral campaign as
before,'' said Hubert De Ronceray, conservative candidate of the
Mobilization for National Development Party.
   Louis Dejoie Jr., candidate of the moderate National
Agricultural and Industrial Party, said: ``We will not ee
intimidated, but will go ahead with our campaign. To establish
democracy is to honor the memory of the victims of dictatorship.''
   Aristide visited the wounded at the hospital. Hundreds of
cheering supporters greeted him. Later, Dejoie arrived and the two
candidates embraced.
   The United Nations representative in Haiti, Reinhardt Helmke,
said he believed the elections would stay on track.
   ``At this stage, the electoral process is not compromised,'' he
said. ``This is the type of thing that everybody was expecting
would happen at some point.''
   Ismael Diallo, spokesman for the U.N. Election Verification
Mission, said the elections would proceed because the Electoral
Council, the army and Haitians ``are determined to go ahead and
make a success of these elections.''
   The 37-year-old Roman Catholic priest, target of three previous
assassination attempts, had left the rally shortly before the
attack.
   He has been hailed as a ``prophet'' by many and has a huge
following among the country's poor, the majority in this Caribbean
nation of 6 million people where violence and intimidation have
traditionally pervaded politics.
   ``After what happened it's normal our blood is boiling,''
Aristide said in the radio broadcast. ``It could have been
prevented ... all they had to do was arrest Roger Lafontant ... We
demand the immediate arrest of Roger Lafontant.''
   Lafontant denied responsibility in an interview broadcast on
Radio Lumiere. He insinuated Aristide was behind it, saying, ``the
crime profits Aristide,'' apparently a reference to the public
sympathy it will generate.
   The Tonton Macoutes were formed under the late dictator Francois
Duvalier in 1957. The family rule ended in 1986 when his son,
Jean-Claude Duvalier was forced into exile by a popular uprising.
   This month's elections will be the first democratic presidential
vote since Haiti's slave population rose up and won independence
from France 186 years ago.
   More than 400 international observers, including former
President Carter, along with unarmed military security advisers,
have agreed to monitor the balloting.

   President Bush on Thursday cast doubt on
prospects for a January summit in Moscow with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and sources said the meeting might slip to
February.
   The Persian Gulf crisis is one reason for the uncertain timing,
said White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   ``It's not an easy time to be traveling,'' he said, referring to
the Jan. 15 deadline set in a U.N. resolution authorizing force
against Iraq unless it withdraws from Kuwait.
   Both the United States and Soviet Union are unsettled about
summit timing, Fitzwater said. ``I think we're saying, let's wait a
little bit longer before we set a date,'' he added.
   Bush said at a Santiago news conference that plans for a meeting
next month were ``not totally'' abandoned. Asked if the trip were
being canceled, he replied, ``Not as far as I'm concerned.''
   Sources said January was the target date for the trip but that
scheduling difficulties and logistical problems had cropped up.
``As a result, it's possible it could slip to February,'' one
source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Bush has said he would like to visit Moscow early next year, but
has insisted that his trip be linked with the signing of a
U.S.-Soviet treaty to slash long-range nuclear weapons.
   A White House advance team was supposed to have left for Moscow
in mid-December to begin planning for Bush's visit, but the trip
was unexpectedly called off. One source familiar with Bush's
schedule said it showed no foreign travel in January.
   Fitzwater said the advance trip was put off because of the lack
of a date for Bush's visit. He said Jan. 6 had been mentioned as
one possibility, and that mid-January had been another.
   ``It's all tied to the START (nuclear arms negotiations)
treaty,'' he said.
   As president, Bush has held summits with Gorbachev in
Washington, Malta and Helsinki. The two leaders met for more than
two hours in Paris last month during a 34-nation summit on the
future of Europe after the Cold War.

   Baghdad wants all the hostages it has been
holding to be released and home by Christmas, Iraq's U.N.
ambassador said Thursday.
   ``Definitely, we would like to see everyone with his family by
Christmas, because that is a very joyous and happy occasion, and it
is time for family reunions,'' said Ambassador Abdul Amir
al-Anbari.
   Foreigners may begin leaving as early as Saturday, Iraq
officials in Baghdad said late Thursday, though visa processing may
take days.
   There are an estimated 900 U.S. hostages among the thousands
held by the Iraqis in Iraq and Kuwait in the aftermath of Iraq's
Aug. 2 invasion of the neighboring oil-rich emirate.
   The Iraqi ambassador said it might speed the release of the
detainees if the United States sent planes to Jordan to pick them
up.
   ``Definitely, they could send the planes to Amman, and from
Amman it would be a short flight,'' al-Anbari said.
   ``It is a matter of logistical things,'' he said.
   Iraq President Saddam Hussein said Thursday that all hostages
would be released, but he did not say when.
   The United States applauded the announcement, but said it still
wants all Iraqi occupation forces out of Kuwait by Jan. 15, as
spelled out in a U.N. Security Council resolution passed last week.
   If not, multinational forces are authorized to take military
action against Iraq.
   Saddam's dramatic announcement signaled the removal of a major
obstacle to resolving the 4-month-old Persian Gulf crisis.
   The State Department, in a message for broadcast by the Voice of
America, advised U.S. citizens in Iraq and Kuwait it was making
preparations for their evacuation as soon as they are permitted to
leave.
   Several governments and relatives of hostages quickly welcomed
Saddam's announcement, which the Iraqi leader called a response to
the ``positive changes'' of recent diplomatic moves.
   In all, there are an estimated 950,000 foreigners in Iraq and
occupied Kuwait, but Saddam earlier said most Asians and Arabs -
the majority of the foreigners - were free to leave.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said the United States had
received official notification in Baghdad that the foreigners would
be set free.
   Saddam's announcement was made by the official Iraqi News
Agency, which published a letter from him instructing the National
Assembly to approve the release.
   Parliament routinely accepts his recommendations, and the
release was expected soon after the vote - which could come as
early as Friday.

<HEAD>Two Irishmen Convicted of Planning Bomb Attacks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury on Thursday convicted two suspected IRA
members of planning a bombing campaign on the British mainland, and
they were sentenced to 30 years each in prison.
   Damien McComb, 22, and Liam O'Dhuibhir, 28, gave clenched-fist
salutes and shouted ``Victory to the IRA!'' as they were taken away
after sentencing.
   Judge Simon Brown told McComb and O'Dhuibhir they were
``ruthless, dangerous, merciless men intent on carnage.''
   ``There is no doubt whatever you are a pair of IRA terrorists
who were intent late last year upon a bombing campaign here on the
mainland which would have wreaked death and destruction, very
probably singling out men of public service, worth and honor as
your victims,'' he said.
   Earlier, the jury of eight women and four men convicted the pair
of conspiring with persons unknown to explode bombs in Britain on
various dates before Dec. 22. The men denied the charge.
   Police arrested McComb and O'Dhuibhir at gunpoint Dec. 21 last
year as the pair removed weapons and explosives from hiding places
on the Welsh coast. Police said the men's hit list, discovered
later, included the entire British Cabinet.
   At the start of the trial, prosecutor John Nutting said late in
1989 the pair were in the ``preparatory stages'' of a British
bombing campaign. All the equipment seized with the men ``bore the
hallmarks of Provisional IRA material,'' he said.
   The so-called Provisionals, now the only active Irish Republican
Army faction, grew out of a 1969 split in the militant movement,
which has engaged in a bombing and shooting campaign to end British
rule in Northern Ireland.
   Nutting said in November last year that police recovered 10
guns, more than 1,300 rounds of ammunition, 88 pounds of Semtex
explosive, hand-grenades and bomb timers and detonators at two
hiding places at St. Bride's Bay in the southern Welsh county of
Pembrokeshire.
   They replaced the caches and staked out the hiding places until
McComb and O'Dhuibhir returned Dec. 21, he said.
   In a house in Luton, southern England, where O'Dhuibhir had
rented a room, police found ammunition, radio equipment, false
identification documents and a list of people prominent in British
public life ``including a full list of the Cabinet and the names of
a number of middle-ranking and junior ministers,'' Nutting said.
   McComb, from Belfast, told the court he and O'Dhuibhir had
agreed to bring something back to Ireland from Britain for friends,
but had not realized it was arms and explosives until they got to
Wales.
   Dubliner O'Dhuibhir, who did not give evidence, was jailed for
five years in Dublin in 1984 for attempted kidnapping, illegal
possession of arms and using a gun to resist arrest. He was
released in 1987 for good behavior.

   Twenty-five pounds of cocaine was found
Thursday by security forces aboard an American Airlines plane at
Bogota's airport, police said.
   Drug smugglers placed the cocaine in a hole they drilled under a
seat in aisle 28 of the airplane bound for Miami, an airport police
report said.
   During a routine inspection, police found the drugs, which had
fallen from the cabin into the baggage department, the report said.
   Police said they were investigating how traffickers managed to
board the plane and open up the floor. There were no arrests, the
report said.

<TEXT>
   Lech Walesa said in an interview Thursday
that if he wins the presidency, his challenger should be barred
from leaving the country until he proves his campaign allegations
or apologizes for ``abusing Poland's good name.''
   Walesa told the government-owned daily Rzeczpospolita that
recent charges by emigre businessman Stanislaw Tyminski ``cannot be
overlooked, even in the name of democracy.''
   The election will be held Sunday. Walesa refused to hold a
televised debate with Tyminski on Thursday night, as requested by
his opponent after Tyminski backed out of a confrontation last
week. Walesa showed up for that debate to find he faced only an
empty chair.
   Tyminski said he wanted to face Walesa Thursday night to ``sum
up'' the campaign. But Walesa accused him of plotting a last-minute
smear to which he would not be able to respond because of the ban
on campaigning after noon on Friday.
   The challenger has insinuated repeatedly that he has damaging
material about Walesa that would force the Solidarity labor leader
into exile. Walesa has demanded proof and says no such documents
could exist.
   At a news conference later Thursday, Tyminski again refused to
release the damaging material he claims to have. ``There are many
documents, but I don't think (it is) in the best interest of the
country to state them,'' he said Thursday night.
   He later promised to reveal the information during his final
campaign stop Friday morning in Szeczin, but then said he had not
made the ``political decision'' whether to do so.
   At another point, Tyminski read from a magazine interview with
Walesa, focusing on Walesa's contention that civil unrest will
develop if Tyminski failed as president to fulfill promises for
speedy economic improvement. Tyminski said those were the words of
a ``terrorist, an assailant.''
   In his interview Thursday, Walesa said, ``Tyminski must not be
allowed out of the country.''
   ``He must account for everything that brought Poland harm, for
abusing Poland's good name in the world.''
   In particular, Walesa said, Tyminski must apologize to Prime
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, whom he accused of treason by creating
economic chaos.
   Mazowiecki, who was picked by Walesa to be the East bloc's first
non-Communist government head and lead the country's dramatic
reforms, resigned after Tyminski defeated him in the first election
round on Nov. 25. His government's resignation has not yet been
accepted by Parliament.
   After a bitter first-round campaign battle with his former
adviser, Walesa has appealed for Mazowiecki's government to stay on
to stabilize the country and has asked the prime ministers'
supporters to vote for him Sunday.
   The Polish-born Tyminski also has passports from Peru, where he
says he underwent a spiritual transformation during the early
1980s, and Canada, where he is the leader of the fringe Libertarian
Party.
   Tyminski has refused to reveal his plans for after the election,
saying he is concentrating on winning.
   Interior Minister Krzysztof Kozlowski said at a news conference
Thursday that no evidence has emerged for holding Tyminski in the
country if he loses.
   But, he added, the ministry remains convinced after repeated
checking of its passport records that Tyminski was issued Polish
visas in Libya seven times between 1980 and 1989. Tyminski has
denied ever being in Libya.
   Tyminski won support from Poles with his promises of a quick fix
for Poland's shattered economy.
   Two polls on Wednesday showed Walesa widening his second-round
lead, however. One conducted by the private Demoskop agency put
Walesa ahead 61 percent to 20 percent, while state television
pollsters said he led 58 percent to 23 percent. Both surveys put
the undecided at 19 percent.
   Tyminski has threatened a suit against state television, which
interviewed a Canadian couple who said he abused his wife and
denied his children food and medicine.
   Tyminski denied the allegations.

   Space shuttle Columbia's star-gazing
mission suffered yet another major setback when the astronauts
Thursday lost their only working computer terminal for operating a
$150 million observatory.
   Observations, already lagging far behind, were halted as a
frustrated NASA scrambled to devise a plan to control three of the
telescopes from the ground.
   ``We've got to bootstrap ourselves from ground zero,'' said
mission scientist Ted Gull.
   Controllers developed a procedure in which the telescopes and
their pointing system could be guided by commands from the ground.
The astronauts, aided by data from the ground, could manually steer
the telescopes toward desired targets with a joystick and
television cameras.
   Using that process, one telescope observed a supernova Thursday
night, said mission manager Jack Jones. Scientists planned to
attempt additional observations through the night with the other
telescopes.
   ``We've now got a way to operate,'' Jones said.
   But Jones could not say yet how well the new process would work
or how many observations may be lost because of the latest problem.
   It was the latest in a series of blows to the mission, which was
delayed six months by shuttle fuel leaks and suffered instrument
failure within a few hours of Columbia's liftoff Sunday. The
shuttle is to land Tuesday.
   ``I'm not sure whether to smile ear to ear or cry,'' said
William Blair of Johns Hopkins University, revealing data of a
supernova remnant that the school's telescope made before being
shut down.
   The four astronomers aboard Columbia were forced to halt
observations Thursday morning when a flight deck computer
overheated and automatically turned off. Moments before, they had
smelled a burning odor similar to one that filled the cabin Sunday
when they lost the only other terminal for operating the
observatory.
   The astronauts had been managing the Astro observatory's three
ultraviolet telescopes with the one remaining terminal.
   When the first failed computer was disassembled Thursday, its
air vents were found to be clogged with lint. The National
Aeronautics and Space Administration tried to bring that terminal
back on line, but the smell reappeared and astronaut Jeffrey
Hoffman quickly turned the machine off.
   ``No joy on the test. Power is off,'' Hoffman said.
   Mission Control's James Hartsfield said there was no large
release of harmful fumes and the crew's air was fine. The
astronauts had their breathing helmets ready just in case.
   Before Thursday's computer failure, the astronauts have had to
manually steer the telescopes because of nagging problems with the
automatic pointing system, which was used sporadically.
   As a result of the slower, less precise manual method, many
stars were dropped from the observing schedule. Astro was supposed
to have begun examining galaxies, quasars and other high-energy
objects late Sunday.
   Scientists scrapped more targets Thursday in light of the
computer problem. Gull said he could not estimate how many of the
planned 250 objects had been lost.
   ``I would be lying if I said I wasn't frustrated. I mean, I am
frustrated,'' said Mary Jane Taylor, part of the University of
Wisconsin telescope's team.
   ``But I don't think any of us thought that this was going to be
error free,'' she said. ``I don't think anybody thought it was
really going to go 100 percent smoothly.''
   To salvage the rest of the mission, NASA planned to operate the
telescopes via computer commands sent from the ground if neither
flight deck terminal could be repaired. The astronauts, aided by
the ground data, would use a joystick and TV monitors to steer the
instruments in the open cargo bay toward desired stars.
   Johnson Space Center in Houston would control the instrument
pointing system in bringing the telescopes back up one by one,
assisted by astronomers at Marshall Space Flight Center in
Huntsville, Ala. Ground controllers practiced moving the
observatory Thursday afternoon.
   ``Acquisition is going to be difficult,'' Gull said. ``It's
certainly going to be a close teamwork effort.''
   Such a procedure was never practiced before the mission, Gull
said.
   ``We anticipated that an individual instrument might need (to
be) controlled from the ground. But we didn't anticipate that we
might have to control all three instruments from the ground,'' he
said.
   Astro's X-ray telescope was unaffected. The instrument is
operated by computer commands sent from Goddard Space Flight Center
in Greenbelt, Md., and has its own pointing system.
   The X-ray telescope's observing schedule was being revamped,
however, to take advantage of the ultraviolet instruments' idle
time. Many of the targets were supposed to be viewed simultaneously
by all four telescopes.
   Ultraviolet light and X-rays are absorbed by the atmosphere and
thus invisible from the ground. Astronomers had been counting on
Astro's results 218 miles above Earth to improve their
understanding of objects that emit such radiation.
   While waiting for observations to resume, Columbia's seven-man
crew photographed Earth and relaxed.
   ``We're just sitting here, you know, enjoying the view, doing a
few other things,'' said astronaut Sam Durrance.
   The astronauts still planned to conduct a live science lesson
Friday for more than 40 middle-school students at two NASA centers.
The youngsters will be able to question two crew members.

   Catherine Bergeron looked up at the gray, stormy
skies from the steps of Notre-Dame Basilica on Thursday and
recalled it was much the same kind of day as a year ago - when her
sister Genevieve and 13 other women were shot to death.
   The women, 13 of them engineering students, died and 13 were
wounded when Marc Lepine stormed Ecole Polytechnique on Dec. 6,
1989, with a semi-automatic rifle. He said his fight was against
``feminists.'' His rampage ended when he turned the gun on himself.
   The basilica memorial service was one of many commemorative
events planned across Canada to mark the anniversary of the
massacre.
   ``It is hard that it is the anniversary, especially seeing that
the weather is much the same as last year,'' said 20-year-old Ms.
Bergeron. ``It is also good that it is the anniversary. Maybe it
will be easier from now on.''
   Dressed in a rust-colored coat, her auburn hair tied behind her
head, she stood with friends under the massive arches of the
basilica.
   Other family members and schoolmates of the victims streamed by
to enter the service.
   Some wept. More were solemn. A few even managed to laugh. But
everyone talked in hushed tones.
   Friends hugged as they met on the steps.
   A man carrying a bouquet of daisies and carnations walked up the
steps.
   At the door, security guards checked identification cards and
invitations. A few seats were reserved for journalists, but the
service was intended to be private. About 1,000 people - family and
friends of victims; students; school employees and politicians -
filled the dimly lit, ornate cathedral.
   The hourlong Mass led by Msgr. Fernand Lecavalier included
unveiling of a replica of the plaque now on the school's west wall,
engraved with 14 names.
   Nathalie Provost, a former student who was wounded in the
shooting, unveiled the replica.
   ``They will rest in our memories and in the memories of those
who succeed us,'' she said.
   Many students joined the fight for tighter gun-control
legislation after the tragedy.
   It was early evening when Lepine, a baseball cap on his head,
walked into a classroom at the engineering school where students
were presenting their projects before the Christmas break.
   He fired his rifle into the ceiling. With attention now fixed on
him, he asked the men in the classroom to leave. Nine women
remained.
   ``Do you know why you're here?'' he asked.
   ``No,'' one answered.
   ``I'm fighting against feminists,'' he said - and started
shooting.
   Six of the women were killed, three wounded.
   Then he roamed the halls, firing at random. Finally he turned
the rifle to his head and pulled the trigger, kiling himself.
   Ms. Bergeron said people have learned much from the tragedy.
   ``It has opened people's eyes to the violence against women in
our society,'' she said.
   ``We - both men and women - have to take a long look in the
mirror. It may be shocking at what we see but it has to be done.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government should coax U.S. science and
industry to monitor Japanese technology as it evolves and not just
when Japan produces a new product, Congress was told Thursday.
   ``We have had great difficulty getting (U.S. business) to pay
attention'' to Japanese innovations until they arrive in America in
the form of imports, said Dr. William F. Finan, a former Commerce
Department official now engaged in private research and consulting.
   ``As more and more of the major technological breakthroughs
originate in Japan, the issue of gaining adequate access to
Japanese research establishments will only gain in importance,''
Finan testified to the Joint Economic Committee.
   He and other witnesses said technology transfer should be a
two-way street but U.S. industry seems passive about applying
results of Japanese research.
   ``The burden of remedying any asymmetry in technology flow
between our two countries falls largely to us,'' Finan said. ``It
is essential for the U.,S. government to continue to jawbone the
U.S. engineering and scientific establishment (to recognize) ... a
national priority that we stay abreast of japan in key, strategic
technologies.''
   Finan disputed ``the belief that Japan only absorbs foreign
knowhow but never supplies it in kind,'' declaring that major
Japanese corporations such as Toshiba, NEC, Fujitsu, Hitachi and
Mitsubishi ``have provided us literally with hours of time of their
staffs at all levels.''
   The government should encourage young American engineers
visiting Japan to feel ``they are participating in a mission of
national importance,'' he said, voicing hope that eventually ``our
companies will value executives who have spent time in Japan to the
same degree that Japanese executives see the path to the top
requiring spending time in the U.S.''

<TEXT>
   A judge Thursday ordered a
newspaper reporter jailed because she refused to reveal all that
she and a murder defendant discussed during interviews.
   Prosecutors want to enter as trial evidence articles written
last month by Libby Averyt about Jermarr Arnold, 32. But the
reporter and her newspaper - the Corpus Christi Caller-Times -
maintain anything unpublished is nobody else's business. So State
District Judge Eric Brown held her in contempt.
   Arnold is accused in the 1983 slaying of jewelry store clerk
Christina Marie Sanchez in Corpus Christi.
   The 26-year-old reporter was expected to go to jail Friday.
Brown ordered her to remain behind bars until she agrees to answer
questions about the interviews with Arnold.
   It will be the second jailing of a Texas reporter this year.
   San Antonio television reporter Brian Karem was jailed for 13
days for refusing to reveal who arranged an interview between him
and a murder suspect.
   Twelve times during a hearing Thursday Ms. Averyt refused to
answer questions on First Amendment grounds. She specifically
refused to reveal any details that were not published.
   ``I don't want to go to jail,'' Ms. Averyt said after the
hearing. ``But my desire to avoid jail is outweighed by my duty to
stand up for what I believe in.''
   ``If reporters are allowed to be used as others' resources, a
consequence may be that reporters will offer the public less and
less information,'' said Larry Rose, the newspaper's executive
editor.
   The newspaper's lawyer, Jorge Rangel, said he planned to appeal
to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals in Austin to keep the
reporter free.
   ``Our position is that some of the questions call for disclosure
of unpublished information,'' Rangel said Wednesday. ``We are
asserting the reporter's qualified privilege under the First
Amendment.''
   The articles quote Arnold as saying that he shot jewelry store
clerk Christina Marie Sanchez.
   Defense attorneys don't want the articles admitted into
evidence. If they are allowed, the lawyers want Ms. Averyt to
testify about the content of her interviews.
   Rangel says a reporter's unpublished material is protected by
the First Amendment of the Constitution and similar provisions in
the Texas Constitution.
   Last week, Brown ordered Ms. Averyt to testify. The judge gave
Rangel until Wednesday to seek a ruling from the 13th Court of
Appeals on the case. When the Corpus Christi appeals court refused
to hear the case, Rangel took it to the Criminal Appeals Court.
   Rangel wanted the appeals courts to direct Brown to reverse his
order requiring Ms. Averyt to discuss the unpublished information.
   Under order from Brown last week, prosecution and defense
attorneys submitted a list of potential questions they may ask Ms.
Averyt.
   Defense attorneys Carl Lewis and Constance Luedicke said last
week they wanted to be able freely to cross-examine Ms. Averyt
about information Arnold may have divulged that was not included in
the articles.
   District Attorney Grant Jones said last week that the
prosecution wants to enter the published articles into evidence
because they contain information that Arnold did not reveal to law
enforcement officers.

   Northwest Airlines officials were
investigating why a company jet ran low on fuel, forcing it to make
an emergency landing at Newark International Airport, an airline
spokeswoman said Thursday.
   No injuries were reported when Flight 90 touched down at
LaGuardia Airport Wednesday, authorities said. The flight from
Minneapolis-St. Paul was bound for New York's LaGuardia Airport.
   The 183 passengers and seven crew members aboard the Boeing 757
were taken by bus to LaGuardia, about 20 miles away, said Northwest
spokeswoman Christie Clapp in St. Paul. The plane was then flown
back to Minneapolis, to be checked out by maintenance experts, she
said.
   The incident came two days after two Northwest jets collided in
heavy fog at Detroit Metropolitan Airport, killing eight people and
injuring 24.
   In January, an Avianca flight en route to New York's Kennedy
airport crashed on Long Island when it ran out of fuel, killing 73
people.

   Hundreds of followers of slain Rabbi Meir
Kahane rioted in Jerusalem on Thursday, hurling flaming torches at
police, who forcefully dispersed the angry extremists.
   Police detained about 25 Kahane supporters. One officer was
beaten by rioters and taken to a hospital with slight injuries,
Jerusalem police spokesman Aharon Elhayani said.
   The fracas came as Kahane supporters were holding a memorial
ceremony for their leader, assassinated in New York on Nov. 5.
   The militant, Brooklyn-born rabbi was known as the founder of
the radical anti-Arab Kach party, which advocates expulsion of
Palestinians from Israel and the occupied territories.
   Earlier Thursday, the Supreme Court rejected a Kach party appeal
to hold a rally in front of the Israel Television building in
Jerusalem to protest what the movement sees as biased news media
coverage.
   As the rally began in a downtown Jerusalem hall, Kach supporters
hurled stones at journalists and TV crews. Kach spokesman Noam
Federman blamed the Supreme Court for the outbreak of violence.
   After a three-hour rally, hundreds of Kach members, waving
torches and shouting ``Kahane! Kahane!'' marched to the town's
entrance and blocked the main Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway, Israel
radio reported.
   Mounted police charged at the crowd and police officers on foot
used clubs to disperse the rioters, who responded by throwing
torches at the officers. Some elderly participants were seen being
dragged away to police vans, the radio said.
   An hour later, about 400 Kahane supporters gathered at a nearby
square, raising pictures of Kahane, blue-and-white Israeli flags
and the yellow flags of their movement, showing a clenched fist
inside the Star of David.
   On a wall, a freshly spray-painted slogan declared: ``Revenge
will come.''
   Border police formed a human chain around the square but about
100 Kach activists managed to block the road again and were
dispersed by force.

   Western governments welcomed Saddam Hussein's
announcement on Thursday that he is freeing all hostages, but said
Iraq must still quit Kuwait.
   President Bush said in Santiago, Chile, that Saddam's
announcement ``will not change my thinking on his need to comply
100 percent, without condition, to the U.N. resolutions'' calling
for withdrawal.
   British Prime Minister John Major echoed the demand. ``Saddam
Hussein still has to withdraw totally and unconditionally from
Kuwait and the legitimate government must be restored,'' he said in
London.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said in New York
it was very good news, if confirmed, ``but I always need the proper
official information about it.''
   French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said Saddam's decision was
``going in the right direction. It's a good sign. Now we have to
wait for this decision to be executed.''
   A spontaneous celebration was held at the Al-Mansour Melia Hotel
in downtown Baghdad, where several hostages were brought from
strategic sites to meet with visiting family members.
   ``We did it at last and now we can go home for Christmas,'' said
Susan Dring, who traveled to Baghdad last week to try to win her
husband's freedom.
   Michael Dring stood behind her, celebrating with a can of
imported beer.
   The reaction from hostage relatives around the world ranged from
cautious optimism to uncontained joy.
   ``I'm over the moon. It's what we've prayed and prayed for,''
said Sue Dorrington, whose British husband is being held in
Baghdad.
   ``I have been in tears all morning since I heard the news. I
just hope it is true,'' said Linda Grant, part of a group of 30
women related to British Airways employees who planned to go to
Baghdad this weekend.
   Relatives of Americans held in Iraq expressed delight.
   ``There were times I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep,'' said
Doris Whatley of Shreveport, La. ``All of a sudden I am a changed
person... because my husband is coming home.''
   Italy's foreign minister, Gianni De Michelis, said the
announcement caused ``deep satisfaction for the Italian government
and for me personally.'' He said he hoped it was a first step
toward full compliance with U.N. resolutions demanding Iraq's
unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan said the crisis should be
resolved fairly and peacefully, based on complete implementation of
the U.N. resolutions. ``I hope that this measure by Iraq is the
first step toward achieving that goal.''
   Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Gerry Collins said in Dublin that
he was very pleased by the report, but ``we are somewhat cautious
and will be so until such time as the news is confirmed.''
   Britain's Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said the embassy in
Baghdad was seeking details on how the release would be organized.
   ``If President Saddam Hussein does not comply in full with the
Security Council resolutions, then he will be forced to do so. If
he does comply, then he will not be attacked,'' Hurd said in the
House of Commons.
   Hurd said it was not known whether Saddam's announcement applied
to 440 Britons known to be in hiding in Kuwait, which Iraq invaded
Aug. 2.
   There are nearly 1,200 Britons held in Iraq and Kuwait, and
about 250 Irish citizens.
   Swiss Foreign Minister Andrea Reichlin said the government was
reacting cautiously to the news. Switzerland has seven citizens
detained in Iraq.
   At the London headquarters of the Gulf Support Group, which aids
relatives of hostages, spokesman Andy Charles said the families
were ``cautiously optimistic and cautiously delighted, but we've
had a lot of similar announcements in the past which have not borne
fruit.''

   Security Council members Thursday held
private talks on a draft resolution that contemplates a peace
conference on the Palestinian problem - one of Iraq's key demands
for solving the Kuwait crisis.
   In Baghdad, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein told his Parliament
to free all foreign hostages. His announcement came just hours
after the text of the draft resolution was leaked and widely
reported, and the releases may begin as early as Saturday,
officials said.
   Saddam said he made his hostage-release decision to ``respond to
positive changes'' on the diplomatic front.
   On Friday, President Bush proposed diplomatic exchanges with
Iraq. Secretary of State James A. Baker III will meet Saddam in
Baghdad, while Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz will come to
Washington to see Bush.
   Saddam has also noted the U.S. Congressional hearings on the
Persian Gulf crisis, in which many senators and former U.S.
officials have challenged the wisdom of military action against
Iraq.
   In its deliberations on the Israeli-occupied lands, the U.N.
Security Council has been considering steps to protect
Palestinians. A scheduled meeting set for Thursday afternoon was
suddenly postponed until Friday, and diplomats met in private and
consulted with their capitals.
   However, on the eve of his arrival in the United States for an
official visit, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said in
London that Israel rejects a possible U.N. call for an
international conference on peace in the Middle East.
   ``Israel will not agree to any foreign body deciding its future
and fate,'' he said.
   The Bush administration, meanwhile, took pains to stress that is
not pushing for any immediate peace conference.
   Bush, visiting Chile, said Thursday there is ``no linkage''
between an Iraqi pullout from Kuwait and Israeli withdrawal from
Arab lands.
   The United States will not give Saddam ``some face-saving way
out of something he shouldn't have gotten into in the first
place,'' Bush told a news conference.
   Bush's spokesman said Washington was making changes in the
language of the U.N. resolution. U.S. officials at the United
Nations confirmed that report but said the changes di not alter the
basic thrust of the draft.
   ``We're trying to work out language that is acceptable, that
meets our policy. Obviously the U.N. wants to speak to this
issue,'' said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, who was in
Chile with Bush.
   The release of all hostages is one of the key demands of the
Security Council, which also insists that Iraq unconditionally
withdraw its troops from Kuwait and restore the government of the
emir of Kuwait.
   A week ago, the Security Council voted 12-2, with one
abstention, to authorize ``all necessary means,'' including a
military strike, to force Iraq to leave Kuwait unless it complies
by Jan. 15.
   The five permanent Security Council members - the United States,
Britain, Soviet Union, France and China - agreed in principle
Wednesday on a text that contemplates a future Middle East peace
conference.
   The approved ``working paper'' would have the council say that
it ``considers that the convening at an appropriate time of an
international peace conference on the Middle East, properly
structured, with the participation of the parties concerned, would
facilitate the achievement of a comprehensive settlement and
lasting peace in the Middle East.''
   The problem of a homeland for the Palestinians would be central
to any such peace settlement.
   It is the first time the United States has approved of the
council taking up the issue of a Middle East peace conference.
   An earlier draft proposal offered by Cuba, Yemen, Malaysia and
Colombia would have said the council ``welcomes the calls for
convening'' a peace conference. That language was diluted
Wednesday.
   Saddam proposed on Aug. 12, just 10 days after his troops
conquered Kuwait, that a solution to the Palestinian homeland
question must be linked to any discussion of the withdrawal of his
army from the emirate.
   The text that the Security Council is considering, however,
contains so many caveats that the proposed Middle East peace
conference could be years in the making, if it happens at all.
   The proposed resolution contains numerous loopholes that would
allow Israel to delay or abort the process. The clause requiring
``the participation of the parties concerned'' gives Israel virtual
veto power over the conference.
   With Shamir due to arrive Friday in the United States, the leak
of the council's ``working paper'' sent U.S. officials into a
flurry of denials that they were calling for a peace conference.
   Baker testified before Congress on Thursday, saying: ``This is
certainly not the time for an international conference.''
   ``We've taken the position for a long time that an international
conference, properly structured, at an appropriate time, might be
useful,'' Baker said.
   Baker also denied there was any linkage between the Kuwait
situation and the Palestinian problem.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said
Thursday he was going to the United States with ``several ideas''
for reviving the Israeli-Arab peace process, but added the gulf
crisis must be resolved first.
   Shamir also thanked Secretary of State James A. Baker III for
his pledge of American support in case of an Iraqi attack on
Israel, but said the Jewish state must fight its own battles.
   ``We welcome (Baker's) remarks, but we never rely on anyone,
even if he is the best friend of Israel,'' Shamir told reporters at
Ben Gurion International Airport before leaving for a nine-day trip
to Britain and the United States.
   On Tuesday, Shamir was scheduled to hold talks with President
Bush on the Persian Gulf crisis and the Israeli-Arab conflict.
   Relations between the two leaders reportedly have been strained
because of Shamir's rejection of U.S. compromises for starting
peace talks. U.S. officials have demanded that Shamir bring
``creative ideas'' to his talks with Bush.
   Asked whether he had any new ideas, Shamir said: ``Concerning
the effort that will have to be made - I assume after the
resolution of this (gulf) crisis - in order to advance a settlement
of the conflict between the Arab world and Israel ... I have
several ideas on where to begin and how to continue, and very much
hope we will succeed in this discussion.''
   Baker had proposed holding preliminary peace talks in Cairo, but
Shamir opposed the composition of the Palestinian delegation,
saying it was an attempt to give the PLO a role in negotiations.
   Concerning the gulf crisis, Shamir said the world had a special
obligation toward Israel. ``Israel is the most threatened, perhaps,
among all the countries (threatened) by Iraq,'' he said.
   Asked whether a peaceful resolution of the Gulf crisis would
leave Israel to fight Iraq alone, he said: ``I don't think we are
facing such a situation but Israel is ready for every possible
situation, and will have to act according to the conditions that
arise.''

   Counselors warned students at a day care center
Thursday of the danger of handguns after a teacher found a loaded
gun in the jacket of a 3-year-old.
   ``He thought it was a toy, and he brought it to school, ready to
play,'' said a kindergarten teacher, who gave her name only as
Adrian. ``He thought he had a toy, and all of a sudden the cops
came.''
   The counseling sessions at the College Community Child Care
Center in Brooklyn came after a school aide, walking her nursery
charges to a playground Wednesday, noticed what looked like the
butt of a gun protruding from the 3-year-old's jacket pocket.
   Police confirmed it was a .25-caliber Raven automatic, with one
live round in the chamber and three in the clip.
   Gail Dubins, another teacher at the center, described the
incident as ``an upsetting situation, yet we are thankful we were
able to discover the gun and no one got hurt. There were no tears
to be shed.''
   Prosecutors refused to press charges against a 27-year-old
family friend who drove the 3-year-old to school the day he showed
up with the gun. Brooklyn District Attorney Charles J. Hynes cited
a lack of evidence.
   The boy, whose name was withheld because of his age, told
detectives he found the gun inside the car of the family friend.
   The child was turned over to the Department of Child Welfare
Services, then returned to his mother, said police spokeswoman
Officer Kim Royster.

<HEAD>Study: Juvenile Drug Enforcement Targets Minorities</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Police and prosecutors nationwide unfairly
target minority offenders in juvenile drug cases, said a study
released Thursday by the National Center for Juvenile Justice.
   The study said drug prosecutions of whites dropped 15 percent
from 1985 to 1988, while prosecutions of non-whites jumped 88
percent in the same period.
   Researchers reviewed more than 300,000 records in the center's
National Juvenile Court Archive.
   The records described drug and alcohol cases in 841
jurisdictions across 17 randomly selected states, officials said.
   The disparity between the number of cases against whites and
those against non-whites was alarming, said Hunter Hurst, director
of the Pittsburgh center, a non-profit research organization
partially funded by the U.S. Justice Department.
   ``The juvenile justice system is rapidly becoming a system
exclusively for minority offenders,'' Hurst said. ``This is one war
we cannot win by focusing solely on minorities and the poor.''
   The study said the number of drug cases involving all youths are
on the rise.
   The rate of arrests per 1,000 youth increased 8 percent from
3.69 in 1985 to 4.12 in 1988. The total number of drug cases in
juvenile court jumped 12 percent in the same period.
   ``A lot has happened in the past five years,'' said U.S.
District Maurice B. Cohill Jr. of Pittsburgh, chairman of the
center's board. ``Crack hit the streets and the federal government
officially launched the war on drugs.''
   Juvenile courts handled more drug possession cases than drug
trafficking cases, the study said. The study showed the number of
trafficking cases was quickly growing.
   The report said the number of juveniles arrested for murder
increased 67 percent from 1985 to 1989.

<HEAD>Maker of Expensive Schizophrenia Drug Could Cut Price</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The maker of an expensive drug used to
treat schizophrenia said it will study alternative ways of
monitoring its use that could cut costs and make it available to
more people.
   The New York Times reported Thursday that the Swiss-owned drug
company, Sandoz Pharmaceuticals, folded to congressional and public
pressure and agreed to reduce the cost of clozapine.
   The drug costs $8,944 in the United States for a year's supply.
A significant portion of the cost is believed to come from a
monitoring system - required by Sandoz - that guards against
potentially fatal side effects.
   An official for the East Hanover-based company said Wednesday
the company agreed only to look for different ways to monitor the
drug.
   ``It could change the overall price structure but we don't know
how much at this point in time,'' said Dr. David L. Winter, vice
president of scientific and external affairs at Sandoz.
   The Food and Drug Administration estimates 200,000 severe
schizophrenics in the United States could benefit from the drug,
but because of the cost only about 7,000 people are taking it.
   Many veterans hospitals and state programs refuse to use the
drug because of its expense. They have said they could save
millions of dollars by monitoring the drug themselves.
   Six states, led by Minnesota, have threatened antitrust
lawsuits, and legislation has been introduced in Congress to make
the drug more affordable.
   Patients taking clozapine are monitored for agranulocytosis, a
potentially fatal side effect that reduces the level of
infection-fighting white blood cells.
   Sandoz has a contract with Caremark Home Services, a national
home health care firm, to operate a monitoring system in which all
patients taking the drug are given blood tests weekly.
   The company withholds the following week's dosage if a patient's
white blood cell count is down or if a blood test is not taken,
Winter said.

<TEXT>
   Tunku Abdul Razak, who led
Malaysia in winning independence from Britain in 1957 and served 13
years as this Southeast Asian nation's first prime minister, died
Thursday night. He was 87.
   He had been in a coma at General Hospital since Wednesday as
doctors tried to stem intestinal bleeding.
   The Tunku had been confined to a wheelchair for the past few
years and had been hospitalized often, but remained active.
   Government chief secretary Ahmad Sarji Abdul Hamid announced
plans for a state funeral and said all official celebrations
Thursday were canceled.
   He said the Tunku will be buried according to Moslem rites at
Langgar Royal Mausoleum in Alor Star, 240 miles northwest of Kuala
Lumpur, in keeping with the Tunku's wishes.
   It was customary to refer to the prime minister as the Tunku, or
prince, because of his royal ancestry.
   In 1946, the Tunku helped found the United Malays National
Organization, or UMNO, which has provided all four of Malaysia's
prime ministers to date.
   He recently took to calling Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad a
dictator, however, and backed the opposition.
   The UMNO, under Mahathir, won the general elections in October.
   The Tunku resigned as prime minister in 1970 and became the
first secretary-general of the Organization of Islamic Conference,
comprising more than 40 Moslem nations, which was formed at his
urging.
   He also served as chairman and columnist of The Star Daily
newspaper and wrote books and movie scripts.
   Born Feb. 8, 1903, to the sultan of the Malay state of Kedah and
his Thai wife, the Tunku studied at Cambridge University in Britain
and many years later earned a law degree there.
   He liked fast cars and horse racing, enjoyed his daily brandy
and mmoked, finding no conflict in this with his Moslem religion.
   ``One of my happiest days is when we got independence,'' he once
said.
   ``My saddest day was May 13. I hope and pray it never happens
again.''
   He was referring to May 13, 1969, Malay-Chinese racial clashes
that left hundreds dead in the streets of Kuala Lumpur.
   The Tunku began losing his political power soon after. Malay
students felt he conceded too much to the Chinese.

   A rare autograph of ``Shoeless'' Joe Jackson,
the illiterate, banned baseball player whose legend has grown with
the help of Hollywood, sold for $23,100 Thursday at auction.
   It was the second-highest price paid for a signature not
attached to a document, and it makes Jackson's autograph worth more
than Babe Ruth's, Ty Cobb's or even Abraham Lincoln's, experts
said.
   The shaky writing is on a 4-inch by 1{-inch piece torn from a
legal paper in 1936, said Herman Darvick, who staged the auction.
   The signature of Button Gwinnett, a signer of the Declaration of
Independence, set the record for an unattached signature, selling
for about $56,000, Darvick said.
   The signature, like other Jackson signatures made on legal
documents in 1922 and 1937, is crude and belabored, Darvick said.
   He said Jackson's wife generally signed his autograph and the
ballplayer signed only formal documents.
   Darvick originally estimated the signature would sell for $1,500
to $2,000. He said it was obtained by a collector of baseball
autographs about 25 years ago.
   The collector, who thought it might be worth about $100, had
obtained it from Jackson's family in Greenville, S.C., Darvick
said.
   ``He had no idea of its value,'' he said.
   Jackson was recently memorialized in two movies, ``Eight Men
Out,'' the story of how the Chicago White Sox sold the 1919 World
Series to gamblers, and ``Field of Dreams,'' in which Jackson
returns from the dead to play baseball in an Iowa corn field.
   ``Shoeless Joe'' hit .356, third highest in history, during a
13-year career that ended abruptly after the 1920 season when the
commissioner of baseball banned him and seven others from the sport
for life for accepting money to throw the 1919 Series to
Cincinnati.
   On his deathbed in 1951, Jackson maintained his innocence.

   Iraq told the world on Thursday that all foreign hostages would
be freed, some as early as this weekend, but President Bush said
release of the thousands of hostages would not weaken U.S. resolve
to get Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.
   In the United Nations, Iraq's U.N. ambassador said all the
hostages, including an estimated 900 Americans held in Iraq and
Kuwait since Iraqi forces overran the oil-rich emirate on Aug. 2,
would likely be home by Christmas.
   ``Definitely, we would like to see everyone with his family by
Christmas, because that is a very joyous and happy occasion, and it
is time for family reunions,'' U.N. Ambassador Abdul Amir al-Anbari
said.
   Iraq officials late Thursday said foreigners can begin leaving
Saturday, and that those in Baghdad, the capital city, can apply
immediately for exit visas. Processing could take days, though, the
officials said.
   The State Department said in Washington that the Voice of
America was broadcasting a message Thursday night meant for U.S.
citizens in Iraq and Kuwait, saying, ``We are making preparations
to evacuate all U.S. citizens as soon as they are permitted to
leave.''
   Saddam Hussein's dramatic announcement signaled the removal of a
major obstacle to resolving the Persian Gulf crisis.
   But Bush said Saddam should not have taken people hostage in the
first place and insisted: ``The man must leave Kuwait without
reservation, without condition'' before the standoff can end.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said in a statement
Congress could take no credit for any release of hostages, and,
``It looks like Saddam is finally hearing the administration's
tough message loud and clear.''
   The news of Saddam's announcement sent oil prices plunging to
their lowest level since August, when Iraq invaded its neighbor.
   The initial drop was more than $2 a barrel, but closed Thursday
on the New York Mercantile Exchange at $26.40 a barrel, an 89-cent
loss.
   Gold prices and the dollar, historically considered safe ways to
protect money during times of political and economic travail, also
ended with losses, which some trading professionals attributed to
the prospects of peace.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold settled at $371.70 an
ounce, off $2.50 from Wednesday.
   Several governments and relatives of hostages quickly welcomed
Saddam's announcement, which the Iraqi leader called a response to
the ``positive changes'' of recent diplomatic moves.
   ``It's an answer to our prayers,'' said Rande Vallekoop, whose
husband has been stranded at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.
   ``We have been praying him home for Christmas ... and it looks
like our answer is coming,'' she said from Minneapolis.
   One American detained in Baghdad was ``absolutely elated,
thilled,'' at Saddam's decision; a British hostage popped open a
can of imported beer in celebration.
   ``I feel delirious that I can leave,'' said David Farington, a
British worker stranded in Baghdad by the Iraqi invasion. He became
one of the foreigners Saddam kept captive to deter an attack on
Iraq. Some were kept at strategic sites to serve as human shields
against attack.
   There are hundreds of thousands of foreigners in Iraq and
occupied Kuwait, but Saddam earlier said most Asians and Arabs -
the majority of the foreigners - were free to leave.
   Baker said the United States had received official notification
in Baghdad that the thousands of foreigners would be set free. It
was unclear when.
   Saddam's announcement was made by the official Iraqi News
Agency, which published a letter from him instructing the National
Assembly to approve the release.
   ``I invite you to take a just decision to end the travel ban
imposed on foreigners and restore to all of them the freedom to
travel. We apologize to those who may have been harmed, and from
God we seek forgiveness,'' the letter said.
   Saddam also said Iraq had completed its deployment in Kuwait,
and therefore the hostages were not longer needed to prevent an
attack. Pentagon spokesman Bob Hall estimated Thursday that more
than 480,000 Iraqi troops now are in and around the conquered
emirate, facing a nearly 400,000-strong multinational force in the
gulf that includes 250,000 American troops.
   Saddam did not say when the foreigners would be freed, but
parliament routinely accepts his recommendations, and the release
was expected soon after the vote - which could come as early as
Friday.
   Bush administration officials are trying to convince Congress
that trade sanctions against Iraq will not force its withdrawal
from Kuwait and that the lawmakers should support a possible
military strike on Iraqi forces.
   Saddam's announcement appeared to be an attempt to influence
those deliberations, and the direct U.S.-Iraq talks scheduled in
Washington and Baghdad for later this month.
   Bush stressed that no secret deal with Saddam was in the works -
or would be considered.
   ``The release of all hostages would be a very good thing, but
the problem is the aggression against Kuwait, and the man must
leave Kuwait without condition,'' Bush said of Saddam.
   ``No single hostage should have been taken in the first place,
and I hope ... Saddam understands that his hostage policy has
incurred the hostility of the whole world,'' Bush told a news
conference in Santiago, Chile, his latest stop on a South American
tour.
   Bush also discouraged efforts by several U.N. nations to set up
a Mideast peace conference.
   He said there is ``no linkage'' between an Iraqi pullout from
Kuwait and Israeli withdrawal from Palestinian territories, which
Saddam has demanded as a condition for withdrawal.
   The United States will not give Saddam Hussein ``some
face-saving way out of something he shouldn't have gotten into in
the first place,'' he said.
   Last week, the U.N. Security Council authorized force against
Iraq by Jan. 15 if it fails to withdraw from Kuwait.
   In Washington, Baker was pressing ahead with efforts to win
congressional support for using force against Iraqi troops if they
do not pull out of Kuwait soon.
   Baker told Congress that releasing the hostages ``does not
lessen, nor should it, our determination that Iraq's aggression
against Kuwait should be reversed.''
   Britain, Spain and Ireland welcomed Saddam's move, and Western
hostages and their relatives were jubilant.
   The wife of one detained American said her husband in Baghdad
was ``absolutely elated, thrilled'' at Saddam's decision. ``I feel
a little free now for the first time in months,'' said Doris
Whatley of Shreveport, La., whose husband, Donald, called her from
Baghdad after the announcement.
   Mrs. Whatley said her husband, an oil foreman held since the
invasion, hoped to hurry home to visit his critically ill father.
   ``He told me he was just so happy because he would have a chance
to see his daddy one last time,'' Mrs. Whatley said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Daily News replacement driver scheduled to
appear before a grand jury probing strike-related violence was
stabbed Thursday by an angry mob, the newspaper's publisher said.
   Publisher James Hoge announced a $100,000 reward for information
leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for the
stabbing in Irvington, N.J.
   The driver, Carlos Chacon, was stabbed in his buttocks and
abdomen and his helper, Derrick Foster, was cut and bruised in the
attack, police said. Chacon, 45, of Harrison, N.J., was
hospitalized in satisfactory condition and Foster, 27, of Newark,
N.J., was treated and released.
   The men, who were on a delivery route, told police they were
surrounded by about 15 men armed with baseball bats, bottles and a
knife. They reported that one attacker said, ``These people that
work for the Daily News are taking my job. I'm going to kill you.''
   Hoge said Chacon was to appear as a witness in a Queens grand
jury's investigation of an Oct. 27 incident in which a striking
Daily News driver, Carlo Costantino of Brooklyn alegedly smashed a
delivery truck's headlights and windows with a baseball bat.
   ``The fact of this cowardly act is made all the more significant
when one realizes that Chacon had been called as a witness in a
grand jury proceeding which began yesterday,'' Hoge said Thursday.
   A law enforcement source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Chacon had not yet testified before the grand jury. It was not
known if there was a link between the stabbing and his scheduled
appearance.
   ``I think the attack is deplorable and none of the union members
condone that sort of behavior,'' said Barry Lipton, leader of the
Newspaper Guild.
   Nine of the newspaper's 10 unions have been on strike since Oct.
25.

<TEXT>
   Thousands overran this tiny town Thursday
in a growing pilgrimage to a church where each day since
Thanksgiving an image many believe looks like the Virgin Mary has
appeared on a wall.
   About 5,000 people waited in line for a look at the strange
light.
   ``I think it's a miracle,'' said Marie Cammarota, 60, of
Sacramento after making her way through St. Dominic's Church.
   The daily crush of visitors to the Roman Catholic church
threatens to overwhelm this community of 1,000 people in the
foothills of the Sierra Nevada range.
   The apparition appears each day for just one hour, from about
9:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m.
   Many prayed as they filed through the church, which seats 200
people. Some wept. And some were skeptical.
   ``It was weird. ... I think it's what you want it to be. If
you're into religion, then you see the Virgin Mary,'' said Tyler
Palacio, 13.
   Everyone agreed they saw something. It started as faint, curved
lines of red, blue, green, purple and pink light. The lines
darkened and extended into a shape that looked like the top half of
a figure. Then it faded away.
   The image always appears above a statue of Jesus on a wall
facing the sun. It might be explained as the optical effect of a
light fixture hanging from the roof. The fixture may be reflecting
colored light coming through a stained-glass window and throwing it
back onto the wall.
   The reflection theory is discounted by those who said the image
has appeared even on cloudy days.
   Bishop Francis Quinn of the Sacramento Diocese, which includes
Colfax about 45 miles east of Sacramento, said if the image
persists he will establish a commission to investigate it.
   ``It could be the image of the Blessed Mary in a silhouette
pose,'' Quinn said. As he sees it: ``She is holding the infant
Jesus in her arms to the left side.''
   Police Chief Bill Mintline said residents aren't bothered by the
fuss.
   ``It's not like a rock concert crowd,'' Mintline said.

<TEXT>
   Tunku Abdul Rahman, who led
Malaysia in winning independence from Britain in 1957 and served 13
years as this Southeast Asian nation's first prime minister, died
Thursday night. He was 87.
   On Friday, thousands of Malaysians filed past his body, lying in
state at the main hall of Parliament House in Kuala Lumpur.
   Doctors lost a two-day battle at General Hospital to stem
intestinal bleeding and other problems.
   The Tunku had been confined to a wheelchair for the past few
years and had been hospitalized often, but remained active.
   The Tunku, which means prince, was a son of the ruler of Kedah
state. He was scheduled to be buried with full royal and state
honors Friday evening at the Royal Mausoleum in Alor Star, 240
miles northwest of the capital.
   Alor Star is Kedah's capital and the prince was being buried
there at his own request, Chief Secretary to the Government Ahmad
Sarji Abdul Hamid told reporters.
   Malaysians affectionately referred to the Tunku as Bapak
Merdeka, or father of Malaysia, because he won independence for the
nation.
   The Tunku resigned as prime minister in 1970. He accused the
present prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, of being behind student
demonstrators who demanded his resignation.
   In 1946, the Tunku helped found the United Malays National
Organization, or UMNO, which has provided all four of Malaysia's
prime ministers to date.
   He recently took to calling Mahathir a dictator, however, and
backed the opposition.
   The UMNO, under Mahathir, won the general elections in October.
   After resigning as prime minister, the Tunku became the first
secretary-general of the Organization of Islamic Conference,
comprising more than 40 Moslem nations, which was formed at his
urging.
   He also served as chairman and columnist of The Star Daily
newspaper and wrote books and movie scripts.
   He liked fast cars and horse racing, enjoyed his daily brandy
and smoked, although some of his pursuits were proscribed under his
Moslem religion.
   ``One of my happiest days is when we got independence,'' he once
said.
   ``My saddest day was May 13. I hope and pray it never happens
again.''
   He was referring to May 13, 1969, Malay-Chinese racial clashes
that left hundreds dead in the streets of Kuala Lumpur.
   The Tunku began losing his political power soon after. Malay
students felt he conceded too much to the Chinese.
   The Tunku is survived by his wife, Sharifah Rodziah, and seven
children, including five adopted children.

   A judge ordered the fiance of convicted
murderer Lawrencia Bembenek to stand trial after a Canadian
policeman testified Thursday the man admitted helping her escape
from prison.
   Judge Henry B. Buslee denied a motion by Dominick Gugliatto's
attorney to bar news media from the Circuit Court hearing.
   Ms. Bembenek, known to her sympathizers as ``Bambi,'' fled July
15 from Taycheedah state prison, where she was serving a life
sentencing for murdering her husband's former wife.
   She and Gugliatto were captured in October in Thunder Bay,
Ontario, where she is fighting deportation.
   Buslee ordered Gugliatto, 35, bound over for trial on charges of
aiding an escape.
   Gugliatto's lawyer Mary Lou Robinson said reporters should be
kept out of the courtroom to ``respect the dignity'' of her client,
a divorced Milwaukee factory worker who says he fell in love with
Ms. Bembenek while visiting another inmate at the prison earlier
this year.
   Buslee rejected the request, saying news media are an
``extension of the public.''
   Gugliatto was released on $100,000 bond Sunday.
   Ms. Bembenek, 32, is a former Milwaukee policewoman, a calendar
model and Playboy Club cocktail waitress. She married policeman
Elfred O. Schultz, then was accused of murdering his ex-wife with
his pistol because she disliked his paying alimony.
   A private detective working on her behalf says she was framed.
She has appealed several times unsuccessfully to get a new trial.
   Ms. Bembenek, working as a waitress under an assumed name, was
captured in Thunder Bay Oct. 17 after a customer recognized her
from a television show that publicized her case.
   Andrew C. Rozdolsky, a constable with the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police, testified that Gugliatto admitted helping Ms. Bembenek
escape from prison and establish a new identity in Ontario.
   Rozdolsky quoted him as saying: ``I'm guilty and I'm not going
to go before a jury and say I'm not guilty.''

   Astronauts aboard the space shuttle
Columbia will take time from their extra-terrestrial duties Friday
to give a science lesson to 11 students and do a little space
agency public relations.
   The project, dubbed Space Classroom by NASA, is designed to
involve more students and teachers in shuttle science missions.
   Members of the seven-man crew of Columbia, which went into orbit
Sunday from Cape Canaveral, Fla., will talk to middle school
students about the electromagnetic spectrum and its relationship to
their astronomy mission.
   After the lesson, the students will remain in a mission control
room to participate in demonstrations and discussions of what they
learned. Karen Widenhofer, a science teacher on temporary
assignment with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,
will do the teaching on the ground.
   The students will then ask questions of the orbiting crew.
   The youngsters also will talk with scientists and control team
members at Marshall Space Flight Center, tour its facilities and
take part in other science sessions.
   The space-to-earth astronomy school originally was scheduled for
September but fuel leaks and telescope problems delayed the launch
until this week.
   The 11 students, chosen from schools across the Southeast, are
Denny Elkins of Snellville, Ga.; Willie Carter of Memphis, Tenn.;
Karen Scott of Nashville, Tenn.; Jennifer Marple of Brentwood,
Tenn.; Bart Doran of Glen, Miss.; and Cindy Hughey of New Hope,
Christopher Battle of New Market, Julie Rodman Athens, Paula
Montgomery of Huntsville, Eric Sweatt of Birmingham, and Mario
Trimble of Montgomery, Ala.
   Columbia carries a $150 million Astro observatory intended to
focus on about 240 high-energy objects in space, such as quasars, a
supernova and a comet as Columbia orbits 218 miles above Earth.
Prospects for using the observatory were dimmed by the loss
Thursday of the only working computer terminal for operating the
stargazing equipment.
   In connection with the Space Classroom project, called
``Assignment: The Stars,'' NASA is offering teachers sets of
materials for classroom use, including a guide for lesson plans and
student activities on the electromagnetic spectrum and a slide
presentation describing the Columbia mission and concepts on the
electromagnetic spectrum and astronomy.
   The 11 students, chosen because of their scientific aptitude,
arrived at Marshall on Thursday and will go through various
exercises before leaving Sunday.

   A motorist was killed and a couple injured
Thursday when two men armed with an assault rifle sprayed a city
street with gunfire, authorities said.
   Kenneth Wiggins, 46, died less than four hours after he was
struck by a single bullet as he drove down a street before dawn,
police said
   Police arrested Ronald Stokes, 40, and recovered an AK-47 rifle
and ammunition clip, police spokesman Tom Santry said. Authorities
searched for a second man.
   Stokes, a paroled convict, was charged with homicide and assault
and battery with a dangerous weapon, Santry said. Stokes was
arrested near the shooting scene after dropping the rifle and
fleeing, police said.
   Kenneth Pounds, 45, had just left his house for work when he
came running back inside fleeing the gunfire, said his wife,
Bettie. She was shot as she tried to evade the gunfire, which
pierced the door even after the couple closed it.
   Pounds was hospitalized at Brigham and Women's Hospital; his
wife was treated and released.
   ``We have no beefs, no arguments or fights, with anyone,'' Mrs.
Pounds said.

   The Commerce Department approved more than 20
shipments of bacteria and other biological agents in recent years
to Iraq and Syria, a congressional lawyer says.
   U.S. experts said that while the agents could be intended for
medical purposes, they also could be used to develop biological
weapons. Both countries are believed to be developing such lethal
arsenals.
   As a result of the shipments, Iraq could end up using
U.S.-supplied goods against American soldiers if war breaks out in
the Persian Gulf, said Ted Jacobs, chief counsel of the House
subcommittee on commerce, consumer and monetary affairs.
   ``We never thought that Iraq would be so dangerous,'' said Peter
Chalfont, secretary of the Wiltron Co. of Morgan Hills, Calif.,
which sold $45,000 in electronic test measuring equipment to Iraq
in 1987. ``It's easy to say in hindsight that maybe the license
shouldn't have been approved.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Iraq is accepting President Bush's offer to
hold talks on the occupation of Kuwait, but the gap between the two
sides remains wide as Secretary of State James A. Baker III
testifies on Capitol Hill.
   Baker plans to use his trip to Baghdad to reiterate three U.S.
demands - that Iraq withdraw from Kuwait, free all foreign hostages
and permit the return of the ousted Kuwaiti government.
   But Sadiq al Mashat, the Iraqi ambassador, told reporters
Wednesday that the Palestinians' dispute with Israel is the
``backbone'' of Iraqi policy.
   ``It has to be addressed some way or another,'' he said. ``Let
us negotiate and arrive at a peaceful settlement which would be in
the interest of everybody in the region.''
   ---&equals;
   WASHINGTON (AP) - U.S. and Soviet negotiators, aiming toward an
early 1991 summit in Moscow, are tackling the remaining obstacles
to a treaty on strategic weapons.
   After clearing away three major roadblocks to the Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty, or START, officials say experts from both sides
will meet Friday in Washington to work on remaining technical
issues. They involve inspections to verify treaty compliance and
telemetry data from ballistic missile testing.
   Those areas of disagreement still could block completion of the
treaty, but one U.S. official said they ``are not enough for anyone
to fall on their sword over.''
   The negotiators have made significant progress over the past
month by agreeing to limit Soviet Backfire bombers that would be
outside the START treaty itself; to allow U.S. nuclear programs
with Britain to continue; and to restrict the launch and payload
weight of the Soviets' modernized, ground-based SS-18 missiles,
said an official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ---&equals;
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Infertile couples are flocking to clinics,
joining self-help groups and lobbying Congress for help. But
contrary to popular perception, a new study says there is no
infertility epidemic.
   ``The overall rate of infertility didn't change between 1982 and
1988,'' said William Mosher, a statistician who co-authored the
federal report. ``This is another chapter in the life story of the
baby boom, whose members have affected American society at every
stage of their lives.''
   One out of 12 women had an impaired ability to have children in
both 1982 and 1988, a steady rate of 8.4 percent, according to the
report by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 1988 that
rate translated into 4.9 million women aged 15 to 44.
   The infertility rate for married couples actually fell from 8.5
percent in 1982 to 7.9 percent or 2.3 million couples in 1988.

   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - California is looking for businesses
willing to hire criminals, and only criminals, by the thousands.
   The new gang of factory workers won't have to commute. In fact,
they'll be in big trouble if they try. And they won't be organizing
unions, guzzling beer after work or chasing co-workers of the
opposite sex.
   The jobs will be blue collar, literally - prison blue.
   Pressed by a rising prison population and tight budget,
California voters decided to encourage businesses to set up shop
inside prisons and put inmates to work so they can contribute to
their upkeep and gain valuable job skills.

   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) - Eleven years after the Islamic revolution
forced women under veils and banned social contact between the
sexes, President Hashemi Rafsanjani is championing a freer attitude
toward sex and social interaction.
   ``We imagine that it is good if we suppress ourselves, endure
frustrations and be patient in our sexual desires. This is
incorrect. It is wrong,'' Rafsanjani said last week at Friday
Prayers, an important forum for political statements.
   ``God has created certain needs in the human being, and he does
not want them left unanswered,'' he said, addressing thousands of
worshippers at Tehran University and millions of his countrymen
listening on radio.
   The efforts are part of a broad political and social
liberalization Ransanjani has pressed, despite sharp opposition,
since Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini died in June 1989.

   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) - Miners are fighting congressional
efforts to reform an 1872 law allowing them to claim public land
for $2.50 an acre. Opponents say it's a relic of the Old West that
makes modern land-grabbing easy.
   Supporters argue that changing the law could put thousands of
miners out of work and cripple one of the nation's basic
industries.
   ``The mining industry is in trouble. It's in deep trouble in the
Congress of the United States,'' said Bill Grannell, executive
director of the Western States Public Lands Coalition in Pueblo,
Colo.
   The coalition of miners, logging interests and ranchers who use
federal land, mostly in the West, has launched a petition drive to
preserve the Mining Law of 1872.

   A year after sweeping to power,
Eastern Europe's intellectuals face a dilemma: how to mesh their
old job of keeping the national identity with the new one of
conducting practical politics.
   For 40 years, these men and women preserved the cultures of
their nations in spite of Communist repression and guarded
individuality against collectivism.
   Intellectuals have played a similar role for at least 100 years
in the region, whose 19th century nationalist movements were
founded by thinkers determined to find places for their nations
apart from giant, alien empires.
   When the Soviet empire suddenly crumbled last year, politics
fell in many cases to the dissidents and intellectuals, the only
figures sufficiently untainted by communism.
   After a deluge of economl be swept out.''
   A senior aide to President Vaclav Havel said, ``It's fun when
you can work on the intellectual concepts, but it's not when you
get caught up in schedules and routine.''
   The aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, reflected a
certain distaste for day-to-day politics that some commentators and
foreign observers see as a serious flaw.
   ``It's sad, but there's almost no politician in sight,'' said
Vladimir Mlynar, a former dissident who now is a journalist at the
daily Lidove Noviny.
   Havel ``doesn't see this too well because his pet theory is that
politicians have brought the world to ruin,'' Mlynar said.
   ``His problem is that, as a dissident, he made up this theory of
moral politics. ... When he became president, he found out you must
behave differently because your opponents behave like politicians.
He would not admit this, but he's learning.''
   The problem is perhaps most acute in Czechoslovakia, where Havel
and other dissidents went in mere weeks from the underground to the
presidential castle that dominates Prague's skyline.
   In Poland, intellectuals were able to ally with the workers 10
years ago in Solidarity. Even after Solidarity was suppressed, real
politics continued underground.
   Change also was more gradual in Hungary, where some dissident
opposition was tolerated. In 1985, the Hungarians held partially
free elections for a Communist-dominated parliament.
   In Bulgaria, as in Czechoslovakia, everything seemed to happen
at once. The ouster in a Politburo coup of Todor Zhivkov, who had
led the nation for 35 years, caught both the opposition and much of
the Communist Party by surprise.
   The party had never articulated its internal split between
reformers and Stalinists, and the opposition had just begun to
organize. They are still quarreling over who should rule.
   Only in Romania did key intellectuals stand aloof from politics,
largely refusing to join either the technocrat-dominated National
Salvation Front or the opposition.
   Their attempt to continue acting as the nation's conscience,
however, drowned in the emotion and intrigues of everyday politics.
   One result of the sudden changes and the intellectuals' new role
is a dearth of cultural interest across the region.
   ``We have lost our theme,'' said Alex Koenigsmark, a
Czechoslovak playwright. Dodging the censors and Communist
oppression used to unite spectators and artists in ``a kind of
plot,'' he said. ``Now, we must search for new identity.''
   Some intellectuals have been slow to abandon what Koenigsmark
called the ``Stalinist warmth'' of the old system, which lured
artists into conformity by offering the material comforts of
special holiday homes or guaranteed fees.
   Tens of thousands of other intellectuals eked out livings in
undemanding jobs. Their reward was plenty of free time to read and
debate existential problems in a fashion that exhilarated
Westerners absorbed in material gain.
   Financial needs also occupy Eastern brains these days.
   ``We have simply no time to read anymore,'' said Vasil
Atanassov, a Bulgarian translator. ``Now, we have to make money.''
   This means East European societies are stripped of the very
people who, as Mlynar put it, should ``shove the mirror in
politicians' faces ... so they cannot move outside certain
boundaries.''
   In Western societies, this role is played largely by the media.
Free, independent media are slow to emerge in Eastern Europe, where
most people know only totalitarianism.
   Especially in the Balkans, a torrent of emotional comment poses
as free reporting.
   Even at Lidove Noviny, which existed in the underground, it
often proves difficult for former dissidents to stand back from the
petty intrigues of daily politics or to criticize friends in power.
   Collapsing economies add to the woes. Culture no longer enjoys
heavy subsidies, meaning soaring ticket and book prices that drive
audiences away.
   Western pop and pornography, long forbidden, are touted
blatantly throughout Eastern Europe. The popular concept that
freedom equals the absence of control makes it difficult to impose
limits on such wares.
   Idealists, who could sketch the new identities for which society
might strive, find such a climate unwelcoming.
   ``It's quite nice to have visions,'' wrote Jaroslav Weiss, a
Lidove Noviny columnist, ``but you have to have money for that.''

   The Institute of the Arab World, opened three years
ago as a showcase of Arab culture, faces hard times as the Persian
Gulf crisis chokes off donations from Kuwait and other major
benefactors.
   The cultural center, which attracts about 5,000 visitors a day,
occupies a stunning building beside the Seine. It was created to
promote Western understanding, but turmoil in the Arab world has
taken its toll.
   France paid most of the $100 million cost of construction for
the institute, which contains a research center, auditorium and
exhibition halls. It also has provided 60 percent of the $20
million yearly operating budget, or about $12 million last year.
   Under the institute's founding charter, members of the Arab
League were to pay the remaining 40 percent. Edga Pisani, the
institute director, said only half a dozen of the 21 counties had
paid their share, resulting in an Arab debt of $30 million
accumulated since 1987.
   Pisani said France would not take over the institute's entire
cost and operation.
   To keep the center in operation, he has eliminated jobs, cut the
budget for buying manuscripts and other materials, and refused to
accept exhibitions or cultural events unless outside parties pay
for them in advance.
   The newspaper Le Monde said one-fourth of the institute staff,
about 50 people, had been laid off.
   Lack of money has been a problem since President Francois
Mitterrand inaugurated the institute in 1987, but things have grown
worse since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Le Monde reported that Kuwait, which once contributed $1.2
million a year, was paying nothing. It said other major debtors
included Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Egypt, Libya and the United Arab
Emirates.
   Political arguments also have plagued the institute. Insiders
accused its first director of hiring a disproportionate number of
Lebanese and not giving all member countries equal influence.
   ``Money is just a pretext; what's $30 million to a rich gulf
state?'' said a Lebanese researcher who regularly makes use of the
institute's facilities. ``The real problem is politics, the
relations among the Arabs.''
   ``The institute has no leadership or direction and it is not the
research center it was supposed to be,'' he said, on condition of
anonymity. Other research facilities in Paris have more Arabic
manuscripts than the institute, he said.
   Others argue that because the institute depends on donors, it
cannot be an authentic showcase of Arab culture.
   ``If the library does not have a work which attacks Algeria,
even indirectly; if the film library does not have a certain movie
that the Saudis don't like, then all is lost,'' Philippe Gardenal
wrote in Liberation, a leftist newspaper.
   He said Paris could end up with a ``sanitized view of the Arab
world, just another stop on the itinerary of hurried tourists
rushing from the department stores to the Folies Bergeres.''
   Saudi Arabia recently canceled an exhibition of photographs
about the country, without explanation. Iraq demanded the removal
of a Syrian caricature from an earlier display, on grounds the
caricature resembled President Saddam Hussein.
   Plans had been made for 1991 to be the ``Year of Morocco.'' They
were canceled when relations between France and Morocco
deteriorated because of a best-selling French biography critical of
King Hassan II.
   Some commentators have suggested the institute focus on France's
Arab population. About 5 million Arabs live in the country, and
many are out of touch with their own culture.
   Jean Nouvel of France designed the institute, whose sleek
metallic facade curves along a bend in the Seine.
   It has been described as one of the most daring and beautiful
buildings in Mitterrand's ambitious state-financed construction
program. Other projects included the new Bastille Opera House and
the Louvre Museum's glass pyramid.
   Nouvel said he was inspired by traditional Arab architecture.
   Space is defined by light and shadow. Sunlight filters
dramatically through an interior facade composed of 25,000 metal
diaphragms reminiscent of the intricate wooden screens on
traditional Arab windows.
   The institute offers temporary exhibits, Europe's largest
reference library on the Arab world, video facilities and
electronic data banks, a 500-seat auditorium and a restaurant with
a breathtaking view of the Paris skyline and Notre Dame cathedral.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Last spring, veteran American climber Jim
Whittaker made one of mountaineering's most difficult and dangerous
endeavors look almost easy - his expedition put a record 20
climbers on the summit of Mount Everest.
   On Monday, PBS airs ``Three Flags Over Everest,'' an hour-long
film account of the feat that, for Whittaker and his team of
American, Soviet and Chinese mountaineers, was more than the
challenge of the world's highest mountain.
   ``It wasn't just a climb to see if we could get to the top,''
Whittaker said in a telephone interview from his home near Seattle.
``It was more of a climb to see if people of different cultures
could get together to work for a common goal.
   ``The message is of people doing things that are difficult for
the good of the world.''
   The idea for the International Peace Climb came to Whittaker six
years ago in pre-glasnost days, when relations between the
superpowers were chillier.
   Whittaker, a world-class mountaineer in 1963 when he became the
first American to stand atop Everest, assumed the role of
globe-trotting diplomat, shuttling between Beijing and Moscow
looking for a commitment to the climb.
   ``When I was in China and approached the idea to the Chinese,
they said, `We have not had Soviets in our country in 30 years,'''
Whittaker said.
   ``And I said, `Yes, I understood that, but you had come to our
country with ping-pong balls and ping-pong paddles and we'd like to
come to your country with the Soviets with ice axes and crampons.''
   The Americans - financed through Whittaker's lectures,
individual and corporate contributions and support from the outdoor
industry - supplied the cash and equipment to mount the $1.1
million expedition to the top of Everest, located on the border of
Nepal and Tibet.
   Still, the Soviets and the Chinese were slow to agree, for fear
the other nation would back out. They joined only after
considerable negotiations.
   For the 61-year-old expedition leader, the climb had another
symbolic goal beyond goodwill among the three nations.
   The mountaineers originally expected to be on the summit April
22, the 20th anniversary of Earth Day, a chance ``to highlight that
we were going to clean the Earth from the top down,'' Whittaker
said.
   Severe cold and 100 mph winds delayed the summit attempt for
more than a week. But on May 7, the mountaineers awoke to perfect
weather.
   Setting aside language differences and disputes over climbing
styles, six climbers - two from each nation - made it to the
29,028-foot summit, the top of the world.
   During a remarkable four-day window of favorable weather, 14
more members of the expedition ascended. No previous expedition had
put 20 people on the summit. In 1985, a Norwegian group had 17
reach the top.
   Whittaker, who did not try for the summit, knows his team, made
up of the best climbers from each country, was lucky as well as
skillful: No one died and no one was seriously hurt.
   In Everest history, for every two climbers who had been
successful, one has died in the attempt.
   ``We ran into quite a bit of difficulty, but it always seemed to
work out,'' Whittaker said. ``It seemed like the gods all said,
`Let's give these guys a tough time because we don't want it to be
easy.' In the end though, we had the good luck, right when we
needed it.''

   Elsewhere in television ...
   FROM THE WHO SAYS TV COMEDY IS JUST ONE INFINITELY VARIEGATED
FORMULA? DEPT.: ``You Take the Kids,'' a new half hour comedy
series starring Nell Carter and Roger E. Mosley, takes to the
airwaves Dec. 15 on CBS.
   Carter, who starred for six years in the sitcom ``Gimme a
Break!'' plays Nell Kirkland, ``a less-than-perfect mom who may not
have all the answers but who is always ready with an opinion.''
That's what the publicity says. Honest.
   Mosley (who was sidekick T.C. on ``Magnum, P.I.'' for eight
years) plays her husband, Michael, a school bus driver. You say all
this series needs is a couple of cute kids? How about four?
   There's Raymond, the dreadlocked 16-year-old ``whose biggest
concern is staying cool.'' There's Lorette, the 14-year-old ``who's
in a big hurry to become an adult.'' Uh huh.
   Then there's studious 12-year-old Peter, ``who aspires to be a
doctor and doesn't quite fit in.'' And there's Nate, ``a
10-year-old con artist forever planning his next scam.'' Could any
sitcom viewer ask for more?
   Living in the basement is Nell's cantankerous mother (Leila
Danette), ``who gets all her news from supermarket tabloids and is
still in search of the perfect husband for her already married
daughter.''
   Aw, gimme a break! The series' executive producer is Paul
Haggis, a two-time Emmy winner in 1988 for his work in
``thirtysomething.''

<HEAD>Church Leaders Warn Against Military Offensive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   In times like these, a trenchant, old question gnaws at
consciences: When should nations go to war, and for what?
   That is the moral issue troubling the nation's churches, and
most are saying: No, not now. Not yet. Wait. Have patience. Seek
talks. Negotiate. Pursue every just avenue to avoid the inevitable
horrors of war.
   That burning, apprehensive note echoed through statements of
Protestant, Roman Catholic and Orthodox church leaders as the
United Nations, backed by the United States, authorized the use of
force against Iraq if that nation does not withdraw from Kuwait by
mid-January.
   The anxious, restraining plea had not been noticeable in the
immediate aftermath of Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   In that period, most churches strongly condemned the aggression,
the abuse of civilians and taking of hostages, supporting the
international embargo against Iraq, and the moves by the United
States and others to defend Saudi Arabia.
   Mainly, church voices still hold those positions, but now
indicate alarm at potential offensive tactics against Iraq.
   They want the United Nations to take a principal role, and
remain hopeful that steady international pressure will bring a
peaceful solution. But they bridle at talk of a military offensive.
   Expressing fear the crisis ``is leading our nation steadily
toward war,'' heads of most of the country's main Protestant and
Eastern Orthodox Churches last week declared, ``We are convinced
that war as a means of settling international disputes is in
conflict with the teachings of our faith.''
   The group of 15 church leaders, including top Episcopal,
Lutheran, Orthodox, American Baptist, Presbyterian, Reformed,
United Church and National Council of Churches officers, said they
want justice done in the area.
   They also reiterated condemnation of Iraq's aggression and
support for the U.N. sanctions, but they urged the number of
American troops there be reduced to those the United Nations
requires to maintain ``peace and security.''
   ``We believe that resorting to war to force a solution on the
issue would be disastrous in its human and environnmental costs,''
the leaders said.
   Their stand was similar to that expressed in mid-November by the
National Conference of Catholic Bishops, although the bishops did
not suggest a reduction of U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia, saying
instead:
   ``We understand that a strong military presence can give
credibility to a vigorous pursuit of non-violent solutions to the
crisis.''
   However, after a closed discussion in Washington by the bishops,
their president, Archbishop Daniel Pilarczyk of Cincinnati, wrote
to President Bush urging him to stick to ``peaceful pressure and
not resort to war.''
   Noting that the church's criteria for ``just war'' require that
it be a last resort after all peace efforts fail, that the goal
outweigh the likely damage inflicted and that it minimize civilian
casualties, the letter said:
   ``Moving beyond the deployment of military forces ... to the
undertaking of offensive military action could well violate these
criteria, especially the principles of proportionality and last
resort.''
   The National Council of Churches, including most major
Protestant and Orthodox denominations, called for a halt to the
buildup of U.S. forces in the region and also urged they be pared
to those needed by the United Nations.
   The United States ``increasingly prepares for war, a war that
could lead to the loss of tens of thousands of lives and the
devastation of the region,'' the council's governing board said at
a mid-November meeting in Portland, Ore.
   ``In the face of such reckless and imprudent behavior ... we
have a moral responsibility publicly and unequivocally to oppose
actions that could have such dire consequences,'' the church
representatives added.
   In Cleveland, the Rev. Paul H. Sherry, president of the United
Church of Christ, sent a letter to Bush, saying:
   ``The steady drumbeat of war messages from you and your
administration have sent a shocking message ...
   ``We want you, in turn, to hear the clear message from the
religious community: Do not lead the U.S. into war with Iraq. War
is not the solution to Iraq's immoral invasion of Kuwait and will
lead to severe suffering for untold numbers of people.''
   The United Methodist Council of Bishops urged Bush ``as a
manifestation of his faith in God as revealed in Jesus Christ'' to
pursue every diplomatic avenue to solve the crisis rather than
military action.
   Representatives of the three historic ``peace'' churches - the
Brethren, Friends and Mennonites, want American troops withdrawn
completely, telling Bush that ``Our own hunch is that you are
talking us toward war'' out of economic interests.
   Advocating simpler lifestyles to conserve energy and development
of alternative energy sources, the ``peace'' churches added:
   ``We fear there will be a growing tendency to go to war in the
coming years over resources such as petroleum if we do not find
ways to curtail our dependency on them.''

^French Immersion: A Major Tool in Striving For Bilingualism</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Only 4 million of this officially bilingual
country's 26.5 million people are officially bilingual, and most of
them are French Canadians who learned English.
   The main effort to remedy that situation and fulfill national
policy is called French immersion, which now involves 7.3 percent
of all schoolchildren.
   Every weekday, more than 250,000 English-speaking children troop
to classrooms around the country and spend all or most of the day
studying in French. Enrollment increases every year.
   ``Unlike French programs 20 years ago which graduated students
who could not speak French, sometimes after nine years of studying
the language, French immersion programs are producing functionally
bilingual graduates,'' said D'Iberville Fortier, Canada's
commissioner of official languages.
   Herns Pierre-Jerome, head of French immersion at Lawrence Park
high school in Toronto, added: ``Students in the program not only
have an opportunity to master a language, but in terms of learning,
they are open to other dimensions.''
   Ever since the British sneaked up on the French at Quebec in
1759 and defeated them on the Plains of Abraham, French speakers
have been at a disadvantage. They make up a quarter of Canada's
population, but their minority thrives only in the province of
Quebec and in scattered pockets elsewhere.
   English Canada never troubled itself much with learning French.
   Then, in 1969, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau pushed through the
Official Languages Act. It declared French and English to be the
official languages of Canada and obliged all federal institutions
to provide services in both languages.
   The law put bilingualism at a premium, particularly for federal
jobs, and made the dual nature of Canadian society official.
   Experiments with French immersion began in the 1960s. Programs
blossomed in the 1970s and 1980s. Early fears that Children's
English would suffer or that performance in other subjects would be
affected have been allayed, for the most part.
   ``As an educational experiment, it's a resounding success,''
said Sharon Lapkin, a professor at the University of Toronto and
researcher at the Modern Language Center of the Ontario Institute
for Studies in Education.
   French immersion has its opponents, among them Hector Hammerly,
a professor of linguistics at Simon Fraser University in British
Columbia. This is how he describes the problem:
   ``It's not really immersion. They are not surrounded by French
speakers. They are surrounded by 25 other children who speak French
as badly as they do.''
   Hammerly cited a study indicating that 52 percent of simple
sentences written by immersion students had one or more errors in
grammar or vocabulary.
   ``The immersion approach does not work and cannot work,'' he
said. ``It forces children to communicate far beyond what they
know. They make far more errors than a teacher can correct
effectively.''
   Lori Nash of Ottawa, head of a national group that favors a more
traditional approach to learning French, said: ``They can't be
taught, they can't learn and they can't explore in a second
language as well as in their mother tongue.''
   Claims by others that the program is elitist bring a more mixed
response.
   ``Is the system elitist?,'' Ms. Lapkin asked. ``Yes. Should it
be? No. Does it have to be? No. Are there places where it is less
so? Yes.''
   Pat Brehaut of Sherwood Park, Alberta, is president of Canadian
Parents for French, one of the main organizations supporting French
immersion. She agrees immersion may have been elitist in the
beginning, when many of the children came from better-educated
families of the professional and managerial class.
   ``I think now if you look at children going into the program,
you see a balance of abilities and a balance of socio-economic
backgrounds,'' she said.
   Demand continues to increase. In some parts of the country,
parents line up to enroll their children in immersion programs.
   ``They are still waiting in Calgary, and there always have been
waiting lists in Prince Edward Island,'' Mrs. Brehaut said.
   ``It has been growing since the day it started,'' she said. ``A
year ago, CPF did a survey and we found that 69 percent of
English-speaking parents wanted their children to learn French.''
   Even the most vocal proponents of the program acknowledge
shortcomings.
   According to Fortier, the federal languages commissioner, major
problems include low participation at the secondary school level,
teacher shortages, that the program does not work for all school
districts and that immersion graduates do not have real fluency.
   How the success is evaluated depends on goals and definitions.
   Merrill Swain, head of the Modern Language Center, said the
goals are to develop language skills better than those achieved by
traditional French classes with no loss of mother-tongue
proficiency and no loss in general academic achievement.
   She said immersion had achieved those goals.
   Does bilingualism mean speaking perfect French or just the
ability to communicate effectively?
   ``You can't expect an anglophone child to become a
francophone,'' said Marie-Antoinette Mantione, assistant
coordinator for French as a second language at the Toronto Board of
Education.
   Children working in totally English environments cannot be
expected to become perfect speakers of French, but experts agree
the major achievement is ``functionally bilingual'' children who
are able to communicate and be at ease when speaking French.
   Ms. Swain said immersion is probably the most studied program in
the history of education. Surveys have shown there is no long-term
detrimental effect on the students' English, academic achievement
is comparable to students taught in English and students acquire a
high level of confidence in their ability to handle French.
   Another benefit is that the young English Canadians have a
better understanding of their French-speaking compatriots from
Quebec and elsewhere.
   ``These kids can speak French with an ease that is way beyond
what could be done in a traditional program 20 years ago,'' said
Roy Harvey, principal of Lawrence Park. ``What has that contributed
to a general understanding and tolerance in this country? I would
say a lot.''

<HEAD>Sniping Continues Between Bankers and Farm Credit System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If one sure thing emerged from the Agriculture
Department's recent outlook conference, it was a feeling that
bankers and cooperative lenders aren't hitting it off too well
these days.
   The latest sniping concerns a report released last month by the
American Bankers Association showing that a liberalization of Farm
Credit System lending policies 19 years ago led to a land boom in
the 1970s and a bust in the 1980s.
   Congress created the FCS more than 70 years ago to provide
farmers with a dependable source of credit at competitive rates.
   Today, the system is a $60 billion network of farmer-owned
lending institutions, which include federal land bank and
production credit associations.
   According to the banker-financed study by Ely &amp; Co. Inc. of
Arlington, Va., the FCS ``fueled a financially unsupportable
farmland price boom'' after Congress revised the Farm Credit Act in
1971 so the cooperatively owned system could liberalize its lending
powers.
   The 1971 law, among other things, raised the system's collateral
limit to 85 percent of the market value of farmland from the
previous standard of 65 percent of its agricultural
income-producing value.
   Peter C. Myers, president of the Farm Credit Council, the chiehing
more
powerful - a change in the American public opionion which will
impose restrictions on the decisions and intentions of the evil
ones, led by Bush, the enemy of God.''
   But, despite this change, he said, the ``Iraqi armed forces
should maintain the highest degree of alert and vigilance because
the forces of aggression remain on our sacred soil in Saudi Arabia,
fanning the flames of fire.''
   Iraq banned foreigners from leaving in response to the allied
troop buildup in Saudi Arabia. The United States has contributed
230,000 troops and promised another 200,000. Iraq has deployed
430,000 troops in southern Iraq and Kuwait.
   Saddam said that when the travel ban was first announced, Iraqi
forces ``had not completed their mobilization in Kuwait to confront
a potential military aggression.
   ``Now that the Iraqi military is battle ready,'' Saddam said,
the foreigners should regain their ``freedom to travel.''
   ``We deem it necessary that our National Assembly convene to
take a final and irrevocable stand toward a humanitarian issue,''
he said.

<HEAD>Serving New Masters: Merging and Purging the East Germany Army</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK FRITZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WILDPARK WEST, Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gone are the goose step, the old
allies, the pledge to protect communism from the evil forces of the
other side. Gone, too, is the other side.
   The East German soldiers who once stood on the Cold War front
find the front has moved to their flank. What once was the enemy
flag flies over their garrisons. Old foes are now commanders and
comrades.
   Welcome to NATO, soldier. Your old mission with the Warsaw Pact
is finished. So is the Warsaw Pact.
   Once pointed defiantly westward, the National People's Army now
wears the uniform of a united German military, a more benign entity
pointed nowhere in particular.
   Without firing a shot, the West German armed forces took over
their eastern counterpart in a single day, then fired most of the
officers and cut the force almost in half in a matter of weeks.
   What has been billed as a merger is essentially a purge. The
remaining soldiers must apply to stay. If they are approved, they
will undergo a two-year probation to determine whether they have
the right ideological stuff to continue their careers.
   ``For old soldiers like me, the generals and commanders, it was
right to dismiss them; there's a new command,'' said Gerhard
Seifert, an ousted Communist general who led an engineering corps.
``But firing other professional soldiers - I think they moved too
quickly.''
   Seifert lives in Wildpark West, a village of large homes hidden
in a forest outside Berlin and surrounded by a military complex
once known as National People's Army Defense District No. 84.
   Before World War II, Wildpark West was an exclusive resort for
some of Berlin's wealthiest people. After Germany was divided, it
became home to top officers in the East German army.
   Now, Wildpark West is esentially a retirement community.
   Seifert, who spent 38 years in the army, warmly welcomed a
visitor and displayed snapshots his wife took on Oct. 10, the day
he relinquished his command.
   One shows him on a couch, in uniform, drinking cognac with Gen.
Eckard Jantzen, the West German who took over the base outside
Potsdam, 18 miles south of Berlin.
   ``For years, we were painted a portrait of the Western soldiers
as the enemy,'' Seifert, 59, said jovially. ``But on that day, we
were all military men.''
   Seifert, who was 12 when he watched American planes bomb his
native Chemnitz during World War II, said he had no animosity
toward the West and realized the necessity of his nation's
evolution.
   He expressed disappointment, however, that professional East
German military personnel were dismissed so quickly.
   ``Career soldiers too young for pensions and too old for new
work face a difficult future,'' Seifert said.
   The western army also is becoming smaller, but has not shrunk so
dramatically.
   To get the four World War II allies who conquered Germany to
agree to reunification, the nation must reduce its total forces to
370,000 by 1994.
   On Oct. 3, unification day, West Germany had 460,000 soldiers
and the East had 110,000.
   Only 60,000-80,000 now remain in eastern Germany and the west
has about 450,000, Defense Department spokesman Walter
Reichenmiller said.
   Many soldiers in the east have quit or were conscripts who had
their tours of duty reduced. About 25,000, most of them officers,
were dismissed for being too close to old regime.
   Ultimately, the goal is 50,000 eastern troops and 320,000 in the
west, Reichenmiller said.
   For the soldiers who remain, the biggest challenge will be
thinking differently.
   East German soldiers promised to defend communism and were
subject to rigid external discipline.
   West Germans, in a reaction to Nazi brutality, have been
schooled in ``Innere Fuehrung,'' or moral leadership, a philosophy
that teaches a code of honor, humanity, self-discipline and
responsibility.
   ``One of our major concerns is to educate our eastern friends in
the terms of how we think a military individual should relate to a
community,'' Reichenmiller said.
   ``It's a formidable job. Certainly, it won't work with
everybody, but there are enough people there who are young enough,
tolerant enough to learn.''
   Klaus Becher, a security analyst with the German Society for
Foreign Politics in Cologne, said tensions had arisen because
Western officers know little about the men they now command.
   ``It's uneasy, to say the least,'' he said. ``Some of the
western soldiers look down on their colleagues.''
   Bjorn Trauer, a 19-year-old native of Potsdam drafted in
September, served one month in the National People's Army and now
wears a western uniform.
   ``The western officers are much friendlier,'' he said, ``but I
think it's a shame they had to fire so many of the old officers.''
   Strangely, the part of the old East German army with the darkest
past still remains. About 6,000 border troops, who had orders to
shoot people fleeing the country, remain on duty.
   They are removing the border fortifications - land mines,
watchtowers and electrical fencing - they once monitored.
   ``They will be dismissed once the job is done,'' Reichenmiller
said. ``They have, of course, a rather bad reputation.''
   For the East German soldier, the last year has been a jarring
experience.
   Markus Nitschke, a former soldier from Potsdam, was drafted in
September 1989 just as protests against the old government were
beginning. He said soldiers were given training in riot control,
including how to use nightsticks.
   Soldiers were asked to sign pledges promising to support the
police. He and several others refused, Nitschke said, and that
caused problems initially, but ``after Honecker fell, nobody cared
any more.''
   Communist Party chief Erich Honecker was forced out in October
1989. Nitschke, 20, now is a civil engineering student.
   East Germans elected a democratic government in March that made
major changes, including the remarkable decision to appoint a
pacifist preacher, Rainer Eppelmann, as defense minister.
   He cut the 3-year tour of duty in half, got rid of the goose
step that had been the army's trademark and removed the inductee's
pledge to protect communism.
   German unification eliminated the National People's Army
altogether and is now causing the removal from German soil of its
staunch ally, the Red Army. All 380,000 Soviet soldiers in eastern
Germany must leave within four years.
   They are returning to an economically depressed, ethnically
polarized country whose very existence is in question.
   There have been widespread reports of Soviet soldiers deserting,
selling their guns and uniforms, even committing suicide.
   ``I worked with these men all my life,'' Seifert said. ``I was
trained in Moscow. It's tragic what's happening to them.''

   In an odd side effect of German unification, NATO
pilots streak across the skies in perhaps the finest fighter plane
ever produced by the Warsaw Pact.
   The sleek and deadly MiG-29 is by far the most dazzling prize in
the vast trove of weaponry that once belonged to the East German
armed forces.
   The 24 twin-finned Soviet jets still are flown by eastern German
pilots, who now wear the uniforms of what was once West Germany.
   ``It's absolutely unprecedented,'' said Walter Reichenmiller,
spokesman for the Defense Ministry.
   When the two German nations reunited on Oct. 3, the former West
German military suddenly was handed a large and varied collection
of Soviet combat technology.
   How valuable is it, now that the Soviet threat has abated?
   The question of more immediate import may be: Will it give
Germany's close ally, the United States, a clearer strategic
picture of Iraq, which has much of the same Soviet-built hardware?
   ``If there were some windfall, it would not be very helpful to
talk about it too much in the best interests of the United
States,'' Reichenmiller said. ``Certainly ... some findings are
very interesting.''
   He and independent defense experts say, however, that little can
be gleaned from East Germany weaponry that wasn't known already.
   ``Most of the equipment the East Germans have has been around a
long time,'' said Andrew Duncan of the International Center for
Strategic Studies in London.
   Reichenmiller said the most advanced tank Iraq and East Germany
had in common, the T-72, was 18 years old.
   The MiG-29 is fairly new to both the Iraqis and the East
Germans, who got it in 1988.
   Iraq is believed to have only about 30 among its hundreds of
fighters, and they are so new the Iraqis may not have mastered them
yet, Duncan said.
   Klaus Becher, a security policy analyst at the German Society
for Foreign Politics in Cologne, said Iraq's MiG-29s may be
slightly different versions than East Germany has - with different
electronics systems, for example.
   The MiG-29 mystique is diminished somewhat by the fact that the
Soviets have shopped the plane around to prospective buyers,
including Israel.
   Presumably, Becher said, they also are making information about
its capabilities available. He said the Soviets even let a reporter
from a Western aviation magazine fly a MiG-29.
   ``Sure, it is useful to take these things apart, but the West
always has had ways to do that,'' Becher said.
   The jet has an advanced radar system some experts believe may
give it an edge on the American F-16.
   ``It's a pretty good aircraft,'' Reichenmiller said, adding that
Germany routinely passes such information on to the United States.
   Right now, the 24 MiGs are being kept for research purposes.
Reichenmiller said no decision had been made on whether to put the
MiGs into active service, but that most of the East German arsenal
- hundreds of tanks, older jet fighters, helicopters, guns and
munitions - would be destroyed.
   The German armed forces must shrink to comply with the
international terms of unification. Keeping much of the weaponry in
service also probably would require Germany to buy replacement
parts from the Soviets.
   Germany may keep the Soviet-made transport planes. Reichenmiller
said the government has offered some to the United States for use
in the Persian Gulf.
   He said Soviet transport planes were even being used for a daily
shuttle service carrying government and military personnel from
Bonn, the seat of government, to Berlin, the newly designated
capital of the united country.

<HEAD>Limited or Unlimited Terms: Who Can Tell Which Is Better?</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   According to Vice President Dan Quayle's sales
pitch, there's not much wrong with Congress that couldn't be fixed
by putting a 12-year limit on House or Senate service.
   To that, critics reply that some of the very ills Quayle cited
would only get worse in a Congress populated by people who couldn't
run again.
   It's a case neither side can prove in advance.
   Both sides agree that a constitutional amendment limiting terms
would lead to more competitive congressional elections because it
would force out incumbents and give newcomers a chance.
   They also agree that it is not going to happen any time soon.
   ``This is obviously going to come from outside the beltway,''
Quayle said the other day at a conference sponsored by the American
Enterprise Institute. ``...It is not going to come through members
of Congress seeing the light all of a sudden.''
   He said it wasn't a partisan matter, but term limits would do a
lot more for the Republican than for the Democrats, who have held
control of the House for 36 years and have just extended it to 38.
Forced retirements would open House seats and enhance GOP chances
in future congressional elections.
   A term limit amendment was proposed in the last Congress and
will be introduced again next year, but it won't get anywhere.
Approval would take two-thirds votes in each house. Advocates could
get only 15 senators to sign on last time, and two of them have
since limited their own terms by retiring.
   So the strategy of Americans to Limit Congressional Terms,
seeking to capitalize on the limits approved in three states this
year, is to build pressure for national limits by trying to get the
voters to impose them on state legislatures.
   They hope to get term limit measures on the ballots of at least
15 states in the 1992 elections.
   The group, which calls itself a grass-roots movement with more
than 70,000 members nationwide, held its own conference this week
to push its issue and plan the next campaign.
   But first, some of the limitation measures imposed this year
will face challenges in the courts. That's a sure thing in the case
of the Colorado limits, which reach beyond state legislators and
officeholders to cover senators and House members as well.
   There also have been threats of court action against the state
measure imposed in California and the city limits voted in Kansas
City.
   President Bush has endorsed congressional term limits, but he
hasn't pushed the issue. Quayle has, as vice president and when he
was in Congress, learned first-hand, he says, about the abuses that
can go with seniority.
   ``The longer one is in Congress, the more staff, the more
subcommittees you acquire, and the more bureaucratic the government
becomes,'' Quayle said.
   Critics countered that congressional newcomers lean more heavily
on their staffs, and are more susceptible to special interest
influences.
   ``Well, who do you think has the power right now?'' Quayle
countered. ``...The special interest crowd likes the current
system. It's comfortable. They know the people.''
   He said the turnover produced by limiting terms would attract
talent to Congress, lead people to vote with an eye on issues
rather than on reelection and campaign fundraising, strengthen
party discipline, encourage competition for committee
chairmanships.
   Point by point, critical questioners told him the result could
as easily be the reverse, arguing that those objectives can better
be attained with election reform that would limit spending, staffs,
free mailings and other advantages that make incumbents almost
impossible to dislodge.
   Quayle said he doesn't look for real reform because incumbents
would have to approve it, adding that the prospect of term limits
might give reformers the leverage to force action.
   ``There is a voter revolt brewing,'' he said.

<HEAD>A Military Paradox: Trying To Shrink and Grow at Same Time</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At Marine Corps headquarters in the shadow of
the Pentagon, Col. Russell Appleton shuttles between two desks. At
one, he works to cut the active-duty roster. At the other, he
tracks call-ups of military reserves.
   This seeming contradiction - getting smaller and bigger at the
same time - points up one of the paradoxes lurking behind the
scenes of the dramatic buildup in the Persian Gulf crisis.
   The uniformed services and their civilian overseers are
orchestrating the largest U.S. military operation since Vietnam
while simultaneously carrying out Congress' order to shrink the
military by 80,000 people over the next 10 months.
   Can it be done?
   The Pentagon says ``yes.'' But there are growing indications
that military leaders may ask Congress to set aside the troop cut
goals.
   Appleton, head of manpower policy and planning for the Marines,
may have to tuck away his ``force reduction'' files because, as he
said in a recent interview, ``putting 200,000-plus soldiers,
sailors, marines and airmen on the other side of the world ...
isn't business as usual.''
   Even more unusual is the challenge of adding yet another 200,000
troops as reinforcements for the original deployment, as ordered
Nov. 8 by President Bush to get Iraq out f Kuwait.
   When the full contingency of perhaps 430,000 personnel is in
place, nearly one-quarter of the entire American armed forces will
be committed - more troops than the United States had in Europe at
any time during the Cold War.
   Just a few months ago, Congress put the Pentagon on a path
toward reducing troops by up to 500,000 over the next five years -
part of the now-aborted drive to gain a quick ``peace dividend''
from the collapse of communism.
   Even in the seemingly unlikely event that the gulf crisis is
resolved peacefully and soon, it may force Congress and the Bush
administration to take a new look at how to restructure and reduce
U.S. forces in the post-Cold War era.
   The Pentagon could ask Congress for permission to put off the
troop reductions. But Pete Williams, the chief Defense Department
spokesman, said in a recent interview ``we're still going to try to
hit'' the targets set by Congress in October.
   The problem is seen most clearly in the colliding paths of
reserve and active duty forces.
   Tens of thousands of reservists are being called out of their
civilian jobs to join Operation Desert Shield at the same time many
active duty career officers are being forced to retire.
   The military says it must cut officers and enlisted personnel to
meet the force-reduction targets set by Congress, yet it can't
prepare for a possible war against Iraq without adding more than
100,000 reservists to the active duty force.
   The reserves provide vital skills not available in the
active-duty force, such as certain medical, transport, water
purification and construction services.
   Somewhere in the sands of Saudi Arabia the paradox takes on
real-life meaning.
   ``The fact is there's a reserve colonel standing out there next
to a regular colonel (facing a forced retirement), and it can
become a very, very emotional issue,'' Appleton said.
   The Army, which must absorb about half the 80,000 personnel cuts
for the total U.S. armed forces by Sept. 30, has found a temporary
solution to the conflicting demands presented by Congress and the
gulf crisis.
   On Nov. 23, it froze all active-duty personnel in their
positions. In effect it acknowledged - though not in so many words
- that it could not continue cutting the force while putting
roughly 200,000 Army personnel in Saudi Arabia.
   The other services might be forced to do the same if the gulf
crisis erupts into war.
   ``If we go to hostilities then all bets are off because you then
have casualties that you have to replace,'' Appleton said. ``It
changes the calculus completely.''
   Yet even now the Marine Corps, while officially preventing some
of its personnel deployed for Desert Shield from leaving the
service, is using retirement boards to decide which 100-plus active
duty officers will be forced out of uniform.
   Such boards are used by the services to meet their troop-cut
requirements.
   The Air Force plans to convene a retirement board this month to
force as many as 750 colonels and lieutenant colonels out of
uniform.
   The Army decision to freeze its force, made with the approval of
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, meant that about 5,500 personnel per
month who otherwise would have chosen to leave the Army will be
kept in uniform indefinitely, according to an Army planner who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Army has not only stopped shrinking, but also has grown as a
result of adding more than 68,000 National Guard and Reserve troops
to its ranks as part of Desert Shield. Technically, the reservists
are not counted in the total force level that the Army is legally
required to reach by Sept. 30.
   The complications are especially great for the Army, which also
is trying to manage the huge task of withdrawing 30,000 troops from
Western Europe over the coming year, deactivating some
Germany-based units, and maintaining its other worldwide
commitments - including 40,000 troops in Korea and 50,000 in Japan.
   ``It's an unprecedented challenge,'' said Gen. Gordon Sullivan,
the Army vice chief of staff and a central figure in long-term
planning for restructuring the Army.

   His product tastes horrible, the package is
all wrong, and the name sounds funny. Still, Greg Blazic has
managed to build Fisherman's Friend into one of the leading coughlozenges
in America.
   ``I had commission sales reps who were terrified of the
product,'' Balzic said. ``I'd tell them, `You have to make the
buyer taste the product,' and they say, `You're nuts! I was just
getting in the door!'
   ``But so many of these drugstore chains make decisions by
committee, and if a buyer went to committee with these and somebody
else tasted it first, he wouldn't have a comeback when they said,
`This tastes lousy!'''
   They look like flattened doggie treats, and the powerful taste
of menthol, eucalyptus, licorice and pepper can leave you rolling
your eyes and gasping for breath.
   But people keep buying their Fisherman's Friends.
   ``The reaction is, it tastes terrible, but it's unique because
it's effective,'' said John Zarbatany, president and CEO of Peter
P. Dennis Inc., a wholesale distributor in northwestern New Jersey
and eastern Pennsylvania.
   ``People either love it or hate it, and the people who love it
swear by it,'' Zarbatany said. ``They've built a nice trade out
among the consumer public, and they seem to be coming back from
year to year. They've got a niche in the marketplace that they're
going to maintain.''
   In seven years since he started importing them, Blazic has
managed to carve out increasing shares of the cough lozenge market,
ranking third behind Sucrets and Chloraseptic with a sales volume
of more than $6 million.
   The 125-year-old formula first was sold to English cod fishermen
trying to cope with colds caught in the North Atlantic and hasn't
been changed much since pharmacist James Lofthouse developed it.
   Lofthouse sold the lozenges, 19 at a time, in littl paper
envelopes, still the way his family markets them. The family takes
an old-fashioned approach to the export market, too, appointing one
distributor for each country they target.
   Two distributors failed to catch on in the U.S. before him,
Blazik said.
   ``They tried to sell them as candy,'' he said. In the U.S.
market, Blazik thinks the strong taste and the old-fashioned
packaging work for him.
   ``When you were growing up, wasn't it a belief of your
grandmother that no medicine works unless it tastes bad? I think
there's a psychology about that, for something to really work you
have to pay your dues.''
   Selling at 19 for 99 cents, the lozenges are among the cheapest
on the market.
   ``So it's a good value, and it's got a name that easy to
remember. You know, the recall factor is tremendously high, and
anybody who's ever tasted one of these just forms an opinion, and
they always remember it.''
   Blazik &amp; Associates was incorporated in January 1983, after the
conglomerate he worked for decided to sell off its candy companies.
He went into business with his savings and severance and an
agreement from his wife.
   ``She'd support me for two years, and by the third year if the
company had a 50-50 chance of making it, she'd give me another
year. But she wouldn't have anything to do with the business at
all, because it had to survive on its own.
   Surviving isn't easy in the world of big drug store chains,
Blazik found out. If a product isn't selling, it's taking up
valuable space that could be used to stock something that will make
money.
   He had to convince some very tough buyers for drugstore chains.
   ``I was thrown out of so many places in the early years, it was
incredible,'' he said. ``But the funny thing about this product is
that nobody ever forgets.
   ``You call up and you only get one shot a year with a buyer for
a chain. So I'd get shot down, and I'd know I can't come back for a
year. So I call back a year later, and the guy would say, `Are you
still trying to sell that stuff?'''
   Blazik started with a novel marketing idea: Put the packages in
a plastic boat on a pedestal on the store's counter. The gimmick
worked, although Blazik admits ``People bought because of the boat,
not because of the product. The boat was cute.''
   His company now has 14 employees, but Blazik estimates he still
works 70 to 80 hours a week.
   Someday, Blazik's daughter may join the business - on one
condition.
   ``She told me, `You know, Daddy, when I get older, I want to
sell Fisherman's Friends like you do, but I don't have to eat them,
do I?'''

<HEAD>Forest Service Looking at Forest Instead of Trees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARNARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AGNESS, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Driven by the environmental battle over the
northern spotted owl, the U.S. Forest Service is developing a new
approach to logging that demands looking at the forest, not just
the trees.
   Through the New Perspectives program, the Forest Service is
looking harder look at what cutting down a tree means: to wildlife,
plant life, biological diversity, erosion, sedimentation of
steelhead and salmon spawning beds, and hiking and driving through
the forest.
   New Perspectives is being showcased along Shasta Costa Creek in
the Siskiyou National Forest in southwestern Oregon.
   By careful management, foresters hope to produce in 80 to 120
years the kind of old growth forest that took nature more than 200
years to create.
   ``We're looking beyond the trees,'' said Kurt Wiedenmann,
program director for the project. ``We're looking at it from an
ecological standpoint. Not just timber production.''
   Shasta Costa Creek is a tributary of the Rogue River in the area
where the Klamath Mountains join with the Coast Range. The
watershed runs from an elevation of 200 feet at the creek's mouth
o 5,300 feet at Brandy Peak.
   The watershed provides spawning grounds for salmon and
steelhead, and nesting and hunting grounds for the spotted owl,
which was listed as a threatened species this year. It also is home
to pine martens, which have been proposed for federal protection,
pileated woodpeckers, elk and deer.
   Only 2,000 of the watershed's 23,419 acres have been logged,
making it a potential battleground between environmentalists who
want to preserve old growth forests and the timber industry, which
wants to keep mills rolling.
   As a result, the Forest Service has undertaken an environmental
impact statement, rather than the less demanding environmental
assessment, to plan how it will log the Shasta Costa. It is to be
finished this spring.
   ``No two ways about it, the spotted owl issue was the big driver
in the New Perspectives movement,'' said John Henshaw, the program
coordinator for the Northwest. ``New Perspectives concepts offer a
hope, not a promise, of an ability to continue both amenity- and
commodity-based production on the national forests.''
   In the past decade, scientists such as Jerry Franklin, professor
of ecosystem analysis at the University of Washington and chief
plant ecologist for the Forest Service, began questioning
traditional forestry. They decided nature had some valuable lessons
to teach when it came to harvesting and replanting forests. The
concepts became known as New Forestry.
   ``What we see happening everywhere is an appreciation of the
fact that a more structurally diverse managed forest probably can
do a better job of providing other ecological values, like wildlife
habitat,'' Franklin said.
   The concepts were embraced first at the grassroots level of the
Forest Service and ran up to the top. Chief Dale Robertson thought
they had merit, but thought the term New Forestry implied the old
ways had been bad. So New Perspectives was born.
   On the Shasta Costa, New Perspectives can be described as
logging the forest the way a forest fire would, in a mosaic of
intensities that will grow back with the complex structure of old
growth.
   It includes debris left on the ground to decompose, standing
dead trees where birds can nest and find food, and big green trees
that will become the top of a multistoried canopy that shelters
spotted owls from predators.
   Henshaw said the program is spreading quickly throughout the
Forest Service. But environmental groups and the timber industry
aren't sold on the concept.
   ``I think New Perspectives has its roots in the notion that we
ought to be able to manage everything,'' said Andy Stahl, forester
for the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund. ``I would submit that there
are some lands, some things, that nature does the best at, and one
of those is old growth forests. I don't think the old growth they
will grow in 80 years is going to compare with the old growth
Mother Nature took 300 years to grow.''
   Dennis Hayward, vice president of the North West Timber
Association, said New Perspectives provides a way to manage lands
that have been set aside from logging.
   But where he had hoped to see 17.5 million board feet of timber
come out of Shasta Costa in the next three years, the Forest
Service has proposed cutting 11.2 million board feet.
   ``Compared with what they started out with, their preferred
alternative is a sleight of hand,'' Hayward said. ``They are using
it politically to try to avoid a controversy for three years, and
that is wrong.''

   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. launched a
$90-a-share, $6 billion cash tender offer for NCR Corp., but NCR
said it would fight a takeover unless the phone giant raised the
price by $2.5 billion.
   AT&amp;T made its direct offer to NCR shareholders Wednesday after a
deadline passed for the nation's fifth-largest computer maker to
respond to the takeover bid. NCR said it would enter into merger
talks with AT&amp;T if the phone company increased its takeover bid to
$125 a share, for a total of about $8.5 billion.

   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Negotiators involved in 107-nation free
trade talks reported failure in efforts to resolve a nasty fight
over farm subsidies. Some trade ministers suggested the discussions
might break down.
   The trade ministers emerged just before midnight Wednesday from
a two-hour meeting in which they sought in vain for a compromise
position on the expensive subsidies that developed countries pay to
their farmers.
   If the talks are broken off, even for a brief time, it would put
the entire four-year effort at trade reform in jeopardy. Talks were
to continue Thursday.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Factory orders for manufactured goods bounced
up 2.8 percent in October, the government reported. But analysts
said the jump mostly was due to the transportation sector and the
higher cost of oil.
   The Commerce Department said Wednesday that orders for both
durable and non-durable goods totaled a seasonally adjusted $250.7
billion after a revised 0.2 percent decline the previous month. The
revision showed September orders even weaker than the 0.1 percent
gain initially reported.
   ---
   WASHINGTON (AP) - American workers' productivity grew at a
mediocre annual rate of 0.2 percent in the July-September period,
while the nation's businesses trimmed the working hours of their
employees, the government said.
   Analysts took the 0.2 percent falloff in hours - the first such
decline since 1986 - as a sign that American businesses had been
bracing over the summer for a recession, which many economists
think has taken hold.
   The Labor Departmet's report Wednesday was not surprising
because many American businesses have implemented large-scale
layoffs in recent months.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - A Federal Reserve survey shows the economy in
all regions of the country were either declining or growing
sluggishly at November's end.
   Both retail sales and construction activity were found to be
weak in virtually all of the central bank's 12 districts in its
so-called ``Beige Book'' assessment of the nation's economic pulse.
   The report, released Wednesday, was the latest piece of evidence
that the economy has weakened in recent months.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The government's sale of real estate and other

released Wednesday as the committee opened two days of hearings on

<TEXT>
   Alan Bond, the flamboyant businessman
who bought a Van Gogh and bankrolled a stunning yachting upset, was
charged today in connection with a government investigation of a
collapsed investment bank.
   Bond, whose brewing and mining empire collapsed in a mountain of
some $6 billion in debt, joins a growing list of fallen Australian
high-flyers now facing criminal charges.
   He was accused of concealing information during an attempted
1987 rescue of the investment bank Rothwells Ltd. Police in Perth,
Bond's hometown, said Bond was released on $77,000 bail. He was to
appear in court on Friday.
   In a statement, Bond denied the allegations, saying he is
``absolutely innocent.''
   Bond was charged in an investigation by a special government
task force set up Rothwells collapsed in November 1988 with losses
of about $200 million.
   Police last week charged former Rothwells chief Laurie Connell
and casino boss Dallas Dempster for alleged illegal stock trading.
Three others face trial on charges of falsifying accounts to make
it appear the bank was making substantial profits.
   Prosecutors allege that large, undisclosed borrowing by Connell
of up to $385 million was the main cause of Rothwells' failure.
   Bond joins bankrupt Hooker Corp. head George Herscu and Elders
Resources managing director Geoff Lord as prominent Australian
businessmen to face criminal charges.
   Herscu, one of Australia's 10 richest men until Hooker Corp.
fell on hard times, was convicted Thursday of corruption charges
for paying off a former state official. On Monday, Lord was charged
with 37 similar offenses.
   The charge against Bond, a British-born former sign-painter, was
the latest chapter in a long slide.
   Only three years ago, Bond bought Vincent Van Gogh's ``Irises''
from the auction house Sotheby's for a then-record $53.9 million.
The same yeat he financed Australia's upset of the United States in
the Americas's Cup yacht race.
   At its peak, Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd., the company he founded,
included interests in brewing, media, resources and property. It
had a gold mine and telephone company holdings in Chile, and
brewing and other mining interests in the United States.
   Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke last year praised Bond as
``a great Australian.''
   Bond rode out the 1987 stock-market crash on strong cash flow
from his beer assets. But the man who built a fortune on borrowed
funds continued to overextend and Bond Corp. eventually ran up
estimated debts of more than $6 billion.
   A combination of heavy debts, rising interest rates and bad
business decisions alienated bankers and creditors, put Bond's
Australian brewing interests into receivership and forced him to
sell assets ranging from a Hong Kong office development to a coal
mine.
   In March, Bond sold the Van Gogh for an undisclosed amount amid
reports he had taken a loss.
   In September, he resigned under pressure as chairman and
director of Bond Corp., although he still holds a controlling
interest through his private company, Dallhold Investments. Two
days after the resignation, Bond Corp. reported a loss of $1.72
billion.
   Bond was charged under the Western Australia state Securities
Industry Code with concealing an arrangement between Rothwells and
Bond Corp. from another member of the ``rescue team.''
   Under the deal, Bond Corp. was to contribute $13.1 million to a
rescue package aimed at keeping Rothwells afloat after the October
1987 stock market crash caused a run on its funds.
   But Bond allegedly did not tell other contributors he was to
receive a $12.3 million fee for helping to organize the rescue.
   The charge alleges that by concealing the arrangement, Bond
induced Perth businessman Brian Coppin to contribute to the rescue
through an underwriting agreement with Wardley Australia Securities
Ltd.
   ``I deny absolutely that I acted dishonestly or concealed
anything from Brian Coppin,'' Bond's statement's said.
   He said ``no fee was paid to me, Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd., or
any company associated with me, in connection with the Rothwells
rescue of 1987. I am absolutely innocent of any wrongdoing, and the
charge will be strenuously defended.''

<TEXT>
   A controversial campaign urging
citizens to avoid luxury goods has helped create South Korea's
worst trade frictions since Seoul joined the ranks of the world's
top economies.
   At stake are millions of dollars worth of services, consumer
goods and products from Europe, the United States and other nations
that Korea's most important trading partners claim have been
blocked in the Korean market.
   Foreign diplomats said that in the last year imports have been
removed from stores, consumers buying large items such as
automobiles have been threatened with tax audits and some goods are
being held at customs under obscure regulations.
   Goods as diverse as candy-coated chocolates and luxury
automobiles have been caught in the cross-fire.
   U.S. Ambassador Donald P. Gregg said recently that rising trade
friction threatens to undermine political and economic relations
between Washington and Seoul. The United States is South Korea's
largest trading partner, and has been its chief ally for more than
four deacades.
   ``We don't like it, particularly coming from Korea,'' U.S.
Senator Frank Murkowski of Alaska, a frequent visitor to Korea,
said. He said there is ``a growing concern ... and support for the
merits of retaliation.''
   Korean officials maintain that the campaign is an earnest desire
by citizens to restore frugality and austerity in Korea's fast
changing society. Government officials say they are hard put to
stop it.
   Officials say the movement was not designed as a policy to
discriminate against imports, but they admit privately that in
implementation some imports and Korea's image as a fair trader have
been hurt.
   ``I'm not going to deny there was some misinterpretation,'' said
Kim Sam-hoon, director-general of the international trade bureau
for the Foreign Ministry. ``But we have many people who are
spending excessively and wastefully.''
   The campaign is rife with cultural overtones: Western
materialism and the right to sell to consumers vs. a tightly knit,
homogeneous culture where conspicuous consumption is seen as moral
decay.
   The movement has been described as an anti-import campaign, a
consumer's crusade, an austerity campaign or a spiritual effort to
restore basic Confucian thrift.
   Western trading nations see the campaign as an anti-import
drive, secretly backed by the government and aimed at restricting
access to foreign goods and services. Luxury Korean-made goods have
not been targeted.
   The American Chamber of Commerce, which said the movement was
targeted at imports, was attacked by a band of radical students and
remains under guard by plainclothes riot police.
   The chamber said the campaign ``effectively reinstated a number
of barriers to the importation of consumer goods ... and equated
imported consumer goods with luxury goods.'' It said Korean
consumers would benefit from more choices.
   ``At no time did we challenge other aspects of the campaign -
frugality, austerity, cultural values, Confucian ethics,'' a letter
to chamber members said.
   Koreans feel foreigners do not appreciate the campaign as an
extension of Korea's Confucian culture stressing fruguality and
moderation. They are offended by consumption-oriented Western
societies they feel destroy harmony by allowing the rich to be
different.
   ``The driving force behind this campaign is social discontent
over the extravagant consumption of the rich,'' Deputy Prime
Minister Lee Seung-yun said.
   He said misunderstandings have evolved because the campaign
discourages buying unnecessary imports. ``The reasonable
consumption of foreign goods with regard to quality and price
should not be criticized,'' he said.
   Newspapers have warned that anti-Americanism will increase if
the trade war continues.
   Radicals, farmers and dissidents have staged violent protests
against imports and demanded an end to U.S. pressure to open
markets. They say foreign goods and farm products will adversely
affect the livelihood of Korean workers.
   British Ambassador David Wright said advertisements for foreign
goods have been defaced. He said regulations hamstring banks and
security companies that operate freely in other foreign markets.
   Most significant, he said, the Seoul government is showing signs
of retrenching in its recent promises to liberalize its markets.

<HEAD>Plan Offers $680 Million Over 20 Years To Compensate Workers</HEAD>

   In a key case in the nation's biggest worker
health saga, Eagle-Picher Industries Inc. wants to provide up to
$80 million over 20 years to compensate asbestos disease victims
and avoid declaring bankruptcy.
   Eagle-Picher is widely viewed as a test case for dozens of
companies saddled with huge liabilities stemming from the
production and use of asbestos, the insulation material that causes
lung cancer and other respiratory diseases.
   Two attorneys representing asbestos plaintiffs Wednesday
proposed creating a trust that would begin making payments in
November 1993. The trust would be funded with annual cash payments
by Eagle-Picher and company stock.
   Under the plan, Eagle-Picher would pay $460 million into the
trust over 20 years, $45 million for claims already negotiated and
an estimated $178 million in proceeds from cash flow in company
operations.
   The attorneys said Eagle-Picher, a Cincinnati-based industrial
and auto parts manufacturer, needs to resolve the fate of more than
65,000 asbestos claims quickly or face a financial crisis and
possible Chapter 11 filing.
   ``Eagle-Picher appears to be on the brink of bankruptcy unless
its asbestos-related liabilities are promptly settled,'' attorneys
Stanley Chesley and David I. Shapiro wrote in a 22-page
recommendation to U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein.
   ``The evidence we have seen indicates that Eagle-Picher cannot
generate enough cash from operations to pay its obligations as they
mature,'' the lawyers wrote.
   But two other attorneys appointed by Weinstein to negotiate with
Eagle-Picher are opposing the plan, saying it provides too little
money to resolve existing claims and untold thousands of future
claims.
   ``The obligations of the company are minimal in relation to the
number of persons who have sustained serious injury by way of
occupational exposure to its products,'' plaintiffs' lawyer Peter
Angelos of Baltimore said.
   A hearing was scheduled for Friday on Eagle-Picher's request
that Weinstein declare a class-action to resolve the claims on
grounds the company cannot meet its asbestos liabilities.
   A similar request has been made by the Manville trust fund, the
nation's largest asbestos resolution facility, which faces about
130,000 claims but has run out of cash to pay new claims. A
proposal to restructure the trust is pending.
   Dozens of other former asbestos makers are watching the cases
closely, and judges nationwide are hopeful for model plan to clear
a backlog of 90,000 cases in state and federal courts. Payments to
victims in some instances have been delayed for years, and many
workers have died before receiving compensation.
   Weinstein and asbestos defendants support converting company's
claims into single class actions to reduce legal fees they say are
exhausting assets that could be used to compensate victims.
   Eagle-Picher has paid about $540 million in asbestos claims in
the last five years. Court documents said the company no longer can
sell assets, issue common stock and debt, or use tax refunds and
insurance claims to meet its liabilities.
   Under the settlement plan, Eagle-Picher would create an
independent trust to resolve claims. The company would contribute
$30 million in the first year, $20 million per year for the next
nine years and $25 million per year in the following 10 years, for
a total of $460 million.
   In addition, the trust after five years would receive 25 percent
of Eagle-Picher common stock if the company's meets the payment
plan, and 50 percent if it does not.
   Eagle-Picher would set aside 6.75 percent of its net sales each
year to provide for basic operations. The company's remaining cash
flow would be split with the trust, for a estimated $178 million.
About $45 million in claims already settled but held up by
Weinstein would be paid within 18 months.
   Shapiro and Chesley said in the court papers that victims stand
to receive more money faster if the company remains an operating
entity than if it is forced seeks bankruptcy court protection.
   Eagle-Picher's claims stem from worker exposure to an
asbestos-based pipe sealant the company made primarily for U.S.
government ships from 1934 to 1971.

   Reader's Digest, a symbol of traditional
American values for decades, will compete for a place near Russian
hearths next year.
   Reader's Digest Association Inc. announced plans Wednesday for a
two-year test of a Russian-language edition of its flagship
magazine to be published in the Soviet Union beginning in August
1991.
   The monthly, which is already published in 15 languages in 39
countries, joins a growing list of American publications scrambling
to gain a foothold in the largely untapped Soviet market.
   Business Week magazine launched a Russian-language edition this
past summer. The Ladies Home Journal put a 32-page Russian-language
insert in about 10,000 copies of its November issue that it sent to
the Soviet Union.
   Rodale Press has announced plans to publish a magazine there in
Russian called The New Farmer. The Journal of Commerce plans a
monthly tabloid in Russian starting in January. The trade publisher
International Data Group is producing a pair of Russian-language
magazines, PC World-USSR and Manager.
   Officials of the Magazine Publishers of America said Scientific
American and the inspirational magazine Guideposts are also
planning Russian editions.
   Russell J. Melvin, an executive at the MPA who tracks
international publishing developments, said these efforts ``hinge
on hope'' that changes in the Soviet economic system will open the
country to Western products and ideas.
   In the meantime, publishing ventures face ``nothing but problems
in the short term'' in getting into the Soviet Union.
   Paper is in short supply. Printing operations are not up to
Western standards. Distribution systems are questionable. The
Soviet ruble can not yet be converted into other currencies.
   But Melvin said the Soviet Union is proving a powerful lure to
publishers with its 300 million consumers who have been
economically isolated for years.
   ``They have a great desire for the printed word. Virtually every
magazine that is printed is gobbled up, '' Melvin said.
   Publishers who get in now will be ready to give advertisers a
way to reach those readers once their products become available
there, he said.
   George Grune, chairman of Reader's Digest, said the company has
been studying the market and talking with Soviet officials for two
years. He said the magazine has been assured complete editorial
freedom and that there would be no censorship.
   The magazine will be published monthly with an initial
distribution primarily on newsstands of 50,000, rising to 100,000
within two years.
   Following the format followed with other international editions,
the cover will carry the title Reader's Digest in both English and
Cyrillic.
   A typical edition will contain articles translated from the U.S.
edition of Reader's Digest. The company is sending an editor not
yet selected to Moscow to oversee the operation.
   The cover price, which will be in rubles, has not been
determined. Subscriptions will also be sold.
   Each issue will be about 160 pages, which is about average for
inrternational editions of the magazine, and will carry
advertising. The charge for a four-color, two-page spread in all 12
issues is $35,000.
   The rate for a single page in four colors in the U.S. edition of
Reader's Digest, which has a circulation of 16.25 million, is
$131,000.
   Grune said that after the test period, the company will evaluate
Soviet interest in the magazine and decide whether to continue
doing business there.
   In the meantime, spokesman Bruce Trachtenberg said the company
will bank the proceeds from its sales. Part of the money will be
used to pay for translating, producting and distributing the
magazine.
   If the test is successful, Trachtenberg said the company hopes
to proceed with other publishing ventures in the Soviet Union.
   ``Reader's Digest celebrates the power of the individual. It
gives people tools to live productive daily lives. Those are
universal themes,'' he said.

   Eastern Europe may not be the boundless market
for U.S. products that may manufacturers envision, a new study
suggests.
   Consumers in the region want U.S. fast food and Japanese
electronics but hope to purchase most other goods from Western
European producers, according to a survey of 600 people in
Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, the Soviet Union and
Yugoslavia.
   The study conducted by MAI, a London-based market researcher,
contradicts a widespread notion that Eastern Europeans are eager to
buy almost anything made in America, an official for the research
firm said Wednesday.
   ``The point is that people there are not just sitting with bated
breath waiting for products from U.S. sources,'' said Robert Kaden,
president of MAI's Goldring &amp; Co. division in Chicago.
   ``It will be necessary for most U.S. brands to build both
goodwill and awareness before they begin selling.''
   Some international trade experts said the MAI study reflects an
overly simplistic view of the pan-European market, but they
generally agreed with its conclusion that U.S. companies should
look closely before leaping into Eastern Europe.
   ``It's very much a niche market,'' said management professor
Michael Radnor, executive director of Northwestern University's
International Business Development Program.
   ``There are opportunities there but you have to really have done
your homework to see where there are possibilities.''
   Experts also pointed out that some U.S. makers of consumer goods
are positioned for doing business in Eastern Europe through
subsidiaries or joint ventures.
   For example, Whirlpool Corp., the Michigan-based manufacturer of
dishwashers, refrigerators and other home appliances, owns 57
percent of the large-appliance division of Philips N.V., a Dutch
company that is well known in Europe.
   ``If this survey shows that Eastern Europeans want to buy
appliances from Western European producers, we would say bravo.
That would be ideal for Whirlpool,'' said spokesman T.R. Reid.
   The MAI survey quizzed people on brand name recognition and
product preferences.
   Kaden said Pepsi Cola and Coca-Cola were the most recognized
brands at 99 percent and 97 percent respectively. Levi jeans,
McDonald's hamburgers and the Gillette and Palmolive brands also
were widely recognized, he said.
   But when asked, ``Which of the following types of consumer
products would you like to see more of in the shops and where would
you like them to have been produced,'' North America dominated only
in the fast-food category, Kaden said.
   Soft drinks were not included in the section of the survey on
desired products, nor were Russians polled on product desires
``because they need everything,'' Kaden said.
   When asked where they would prefer to have their cars produced,
Western Europe was the top choice of all countries except
Yugoslavia, where Western Europe tied with Japan, Kaden said.
   People in all five countries indicated they would prefer major
home appliances - washers, dryers and dishwashers - from Western
Europe.
   Western Europe also was the unanimous top choice as a source of
clothing and as a producer of small home appliances, although
Polish subjects indicated an equal preference for Polish-made small
appliances.
   Douglas Lamont, author of the recently published book ``Winning
Worldwide: Strategies For Dominating Global Markets,'' said he was
not surprised by the findings since West Germany has been a
favorite trading partner of Eastern Europe, and the people are also
familiar with French and Dutch-made products.
   ``In this country there is a notion we can sell our products
into Eastern Europe but I think that notion is mistaken,' Lamont
said in an interview from his office in north suburban Evanston.
   ``I think it will take substantive change on the part of Eastern
Europeans to consider American products first on the list,'' he
said.

   Car and truck production cuts, nose-diving sales
and the specter of fourth-quarter financial losses suggest the auto
industry is in a recession.
   If worst-case forecasts come true, the industry next month could
be looking at a financial picture reminiscent of the dark days of
the early 1980s, analysts said Wednesday.
   On Tuesday, the Big Three automakers reported sharp downturns in
late-November car and truck sales.
   ``I think we have established a new lower level of car sales for
a while,'' analyst Douglas Laughlin of Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. of New
York said.
   ``I think it is going to go into and probably through the first
quarter (of 1991) unless we get a real break in interest rates,''
he said.
   ``There is a lot of caution out there,'' Laughlin said of
potential buyers. ``It does look like at least for the auto
industry, it is a recession.''
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp., which
together held 68.2 percent of the total vehicle market in November,
said sales of their North American-made cars and light trucks
during the Nov. 21-30 period this year were 24 percent lower than
the same time last year.
   That paints a gloomy picture when coupled with recent
announcements of production cuts, forecasts for financial losses in
the fourth-quarter, the general softening of the economy and the
threat of war in the Middle East, analysts said.
   GM Chairman Robert Stempel said in a speech last week in Fort
Wayne, Ind., that the largest automaker in the world had cut its
December production schedule by 40 percent to 144,000 vehicles.
   Coincidentally, Ford announced new temporary plant idlings for
December. Chrysler declined to release fourth-quarter production.
   Adjustments in production are common in the industry. But the
size of the GM reduction was significant, especially coming so late
in the quarter.
   As a result of the cut, Stempel said the company expected its
fourth-quarter financial results ``will decline significantly
relative to our ... third-quarter results.''
   In the third quarter, GM said it earned $109 million. However,
it took a $2.1 billion one-time charge for closing some of its
factories, resulting in a $2 billion loss for the period.
   Wall Street analysts forecast that GM would lose somewhere in
the neighborhood of $450 million during the final quarter of this
year.
   Meantime, Ford Motor Co. finance Vice President and Treasurer
David McCammon said in an interview published Wednesday in The Wall
Street Journal that the No. 2 automaker would lose money in the
October-December period also.
   Analysts estimated that Ford would lose around $230 million
during the period and financially struggling Chrysler Corp. would
lose about $35 million in the quarter.
   If those forecasts, which are subject to change, come true, the
fourth quarter of this year would be the first that each of the Big
Three have lost money since mid-1981, when the industry was
affected by the national recession.
   But there are differences between then and now, analysts said.
   ``The magnitude of these (production) cuts would appear to be
something in excess of the current selling rate,'' Laughlin said.
``There is a sincere effort here to avoid an inventory buildup.''
   High inventories inspire big incentives, which slice directly
into profits.
   ``The action appears to be preventative rather than
reactionary,'' Laughlin said.
   He and other analysts said Tuesday's sales report gives a better
picture of the industry's health than other recent 10-day reports,
which showed a much less radical swing in this year's selling rate
compared with a year ago.
   Those earlier reports, analysts have said, included large
numbers of fleet sales to rental car companies and large
corporations. Stripped of those figures, the retail sales rate is
weak, they said.
   ``We don't know how many fleet sales are in the numbers,'' said
analyst Scott Merlis of Morgan, Stanley &amp; Co. in New York.
``Clearly people are taking a wait-and-see attitude toward a
perceived economic crisis and a perceived (Mideast) military
crisis.
   ``It's very hard to buy a car in this atmosphere.''

   Retailing giant Sears, Roebuck and Co. is
freezing the salaries of 20,000 employees for one year in a
cost-cutting move, a published report said today.
   All Sears' salaried employees at the company's Chicago
headquarters will have their 1991 salaries frozen at 1990 levels,
The New York Times reported.
   Store managers, sales managers and other salaried executives in
the merchandising group also will be affected by the freeze, as
will salaried employees in the catalogue and operations, according
to an unidentified Sears spokesman.
   The company, which earned $1.45 billion last year, hopes to save
$24 million to $35 million by imposing the wage freeze, the report
indicated.
   The freeze does not include salespeople, who are paid on an
hourly basis, or the company's financial services businesses, the
Times said.
   Sears has about 500,000 workers, of which about 330,000 are in
the merchandise operation.

<HEAD>Cigarette Smoke Causes Lung Cancer In Nonsmokers, EPA Panel Says</HEAD>

   An Environmental Protection Agency
committee concludes that cigarette smoke causes cancer in
nonsmokers and may be an important cause of bronchitis, pneumonia
and asthma in children.
   The effect of passive smoking on children ``might have a greater
public health impact than the increase in cancer,'' Morton Lippmann
of New York University, chairman of the advisory panel, said
Wednesday.
   The tobacco industry criticized the report's conclusions and the
panel's deliberations.
   But the Coalition on Smoking or Health embraced the panel's
conclusions.
   ``The committee action is a big win for the American people,''
said Fran Du Melle, head of the coalition and deputy director of
the American Lung Association's Washington office.
   ``Given what we know about smoking and lung cancer, there should
be no question that passive smoking can cause lung cancer in
innocent bystanders,'' Du Melle said in a statement. The coalition
is made up of the American Lung Association, the American Heart
Association and the American Cancer Society.
   The EPA panel's acceptance of findings that had been reached in
a draft report on passive smoking assures that those conclusions
will survive in the final version of the report, agency officials
said.
   The report will likely prompt the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration to take steps toward possible adoption of
restrictions on smoking in the workplace, said Roy Clason Jr.,
OSHA's policy director.
   ``The findings of this report are very important in the future
direction OSHA will take,'' he said.
   OSHA has been planning for some time to establish rules on
indoor air quality ``in which we would place a very high emphasis
on the issue of smoking,'' Clason said.
   The draft EPA report was released on June 25. It concluded that
tobacco smoke should be designated a class A carcinogen - a known
cause of human cancer.
   It also estimated that passive smoking kills 3,700 Americans
each year. And it found a link between passive smoking and
increased incidence of bronchitis, pneumonia, wheezing and middle
ear disease in children.
   The report concluded that the children of women who smoke also
have impaired lung growth and development.
   But Brennan Dawson, a spokeswoman for the Tobacco Institute,
said the human evidence did not support the classification of
tobacco smoke as a class A carcinogen.
   She said she expected that ``anti-smokers will continue to use
the document in its draft form to push for restrictions'' on
smoking.
   The expert panel accepted the draft report's conclusion that
``environmental tobacco smoke,'' or ETS, causes lung cancer,
Lippmann said.
   ``We are persuaded that the evidence exists ... for considering
that ETS does cause lung cancer in nonsmokers,'' he said.
   But the panel raised questions about the report's estimate of
3,700 cases per year.
   Lippmann said that number would probably change by the time the
report is revised in accordance with the panel's recommendations.
He said he did not know whether the estimate would increase or
decrease.
   Robert Axelrad, director of the EPA's indoor air division, said
the panel's comments had been useful.
   ``These are all well-known and respected scientists. Their
criticism will ultimately result in a stronger and better
document,'' he said.
   Gary Giovino of the federal Office on Smoking and Health, which
prepares the surgeon general's reports on smoking, said the EPA
report validates conclusions reached in earlier studies by the
National Research Council and the surgeon general.
   ``They've come to the conclusion that previous scientific bodies
have, with more data,'' said Giovino.
   The EPA's report is a review and analysis of available research
on the health risks of passive smoking.

<HEAD>California Seeks to Pull License of Firm That Audited Lincoln
Savings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's largest accounting firm could be
banned from doing business in California because of its audit work
for Charles H. Keating Jr.'s Lincoln Savings.
   Karen J. Scott, executive officer of the state Board of
Accountancy, asked the panel to bar Ernst &amp; Young from doing audits
in California.
   A panel review concluded the company's audits of Lincoln and its
parent, American Continental Corp., were ``grossly negligent,''
according to a board complaint filed last month.
   Scott's Nov. 16 request and the complaint were disclosed this
week.
   Steve Miller, an attorney for Ernst &amp; Young, said Wednesday the
company stands by its audit and will contest the case at hearings
before the Board of Accountancy.
   Experts say Lincoln's collapse will cost taxpayers $2 billion,
the biggest thrift failure ever. Investigations have focused on how
the S&amp;L's finances could have been allowed to deteriorate so badly
before it was seized in 1989.
   A year before the seizure, Ernst &amp; Young's predecessor company,
Arthur Young &amp; Co., issued an unqualified opinion that Lincoln's
upbeat financial statements for 1987 ``fairly represented'' its
financial condition.
   A month later, the chief Arthur Young partner on the account was
hired by American Continental, which tripled his salary.
   The Accountancy Board can clear Ernst &amp; Young or impose
probation, temporary suspension or a permanent ban, said Deputy
Attorney General Michael Granen, who is handling the case for the
board.
   Central to the case are eight Arizona desert land deals traded
by Lincoln. The accounting board contends the deals shouldn't have
qualified as profits because the buyers and sellers were related
through complex business ties.
   Ernst &amp; Young also is the target of a negligence lawsuit filed
in June by state Attorney General John Van de Kamp. The lawsuit
seeks to recover the losses of investors who purchased $250 million
in now-worthless American Continental ``junk bonds'' at Lincoln
branches.
   ``If investors had known the truth, no one would have invested a
dime in these bonds,'' Van de Kamp said in announcing the lawsuit.
``But with Arthur Young standing behind them, their bonds sold
easily.''
   Eugene R. Erbstoesser, Ernst &amp; Young's associate general
counsel, questioned the timing of the attempt to revoke the firm's
license. He speculated the attorney general could be trying to
pressure the company to settle the earlier lawsuit.
   ``I believe this whole thing is totally unnecessary,''
Erbstoesser said. ``All of this is just making the firm's resolve
more determined to clear its name.''

<HEAD>Reorganization Guide, New Indictment Filed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Development Corp. looked ahead toward
reorganization as federal prosecutors looked back at business
practices that got the big-time developer into trouble.
   A consultant hired by the developer filed a reorganization
outline in U.S. Bankruptcy Court on Wednesday, hours after a
federal grand jury added two former executives and dozens of new
charges in issuing a new indictment in the case that supersedes an
earlier indictment.
   The Palmieri Co. proposed placing the assets of the public
company in a private trust, which would sell General Development's
90,000 acres, utilities and other assets over eight to 10 years for
the benefit of creditors.
   Conceding the difficulty of a short-term sell-off, the
consultant said, ``The real estate market, the general economy,
absorption rates and other factors require a relatively long-term
horizon to maximize values.''
   The consultant estimates General Development's assets could be
sold now for $861 million to $986 million for a return of less than
40 cents on the dollar for unsecured creditors.
   Palmieri believes General Development, which settled its
criminal fraud case with a plea bargain last week, could emerge
from Chapter 11 proceedings with an approved reorganization plan by
June 1.
   Meanwhile, arraignment was set for today for Tore DeBella,
former GDC senior vice president of marketing, and Richard Reizen,
former vice president of marketing.
   They joined ex-Chairman David Brown and ex-President Robert
Ehrling as defendants in the criminal case against company
executives. All four resigned last March within days of the
original indictment.
   ``The increased number of counts, it seems to me, is a case of
`That's what you get for not pleading guilty, pal,''' said Joel
Hirschhorn, Ehrling's attorney. ``It's what lawyers call
prosecutorial vindictiveness.''
   Reizen said, ``I'm not guilty of anything that the indictment
charges. My attorney and I will prove that at trial.''
   The first 16-count indictment named the company, Brown and
Ehrling, but the new one grew to 74 counts, added the two former
sales executives and dropped the company because of its guilty plea
to fraud conspiracy.
   The four are accused institutionalizing fraudulent and deceptive
sales tactics that resulted in the sale of more than 10,000 homes
at inflated prices from 1983 to 1989.
   Twenty-three charges claim the executives brought people to
Florida to further the fraud by promoting ``Southward Ho!'' trips
to induce purchases at General Development's nine planned
communities. The defendants face possible $250,000 fines and
10-year prison terms on each count.
   The superseding indictment also includes one fraud conspiracy
count and 50 mail fraud counts carrying a maximum five-year term on
each charge.
   General Development was accused of routinely rigging appraisals
and using deceptive ploys to entice people into buying and to keep
them from finding out their new property wasn't worth what they
paid.
   U.S. District Judge Lenore Nesbitt accepted the company's third
plea offer last Thursday with a guilty plea to one count of fraud
conspiracy.
   Sentencing required a $1 million letter of credit to cover
administration of a $160 million restitution plan for the
victimized homeowners, 10 years of court supervision and five years
probation.
   The company, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in
April, has halted sales and stock trading.

   Share prices were higher at midday Thursday on
London's Stock Exchange, buoyed by the news that Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein has called for the release of all foreigners held by
Iraq.
   At midday, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was up 28.7 points, or 1.3 percent, at 2,181.3.
   Volume was 299.6 million shares.
   Traders said there was an immediate markup of prices on the

subsiding quickly, however, they said.

   Miller Brewing Co. has received 22,000
applications for jobs at a brewery that won't open until next month
and isn't expected to have more than 1,500 employees.
   Miller began advertising to fill the jobs a week ago.
   ``I think we've exceeded our expectations so far,' brewery
spokeswoman Sandra Lewis said. ``We knew we'd get several thousand,
based on what's happened in the past, but maybe not quite this
many.''
   Miller expects to start production at the $411 million brewery
in July. The company has advertised in newspapers in Cincinnati,
Dayton, Hamilton and Middletown for secretarial and clerical
workers and for production workers.
   Applications came from Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana, Ms. Lewis
said. She said Miller is not accepting applications by telephone or
in person to avoid being mobbed by job seekers.
   Ms. Lewis said production would be phased in, starting with only
the workers necessary to start up the plant.
   When the brewery reaches full capacity of 10 million barrels a
year, it could employ up to 1,500 workers, the company has said.
Miller has not said what the jobs will pay. There have been
newspaper advertisements by union organizers who want to represent
employees.
   The brewery was completed in 1981, but Milwaukee-based Miller
never opened it, saying the production capacity was unnecessary
because of declining sales.
   The company said last month that increased beer sales justify
opening the brewery. Miller shipped almost 42 million barrels of
beer last year, its largest year ever.

<HEAD>Government To Allow Increased Foreign Ownership in Broadcasting</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Dollars are U.S.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New Zealand government said
Thursday it will allow foreign companies to increase their stake in
radio and television companies.
   Communications Minister Maurice Williamson said legislation
providing for up to 49.9 percent shareholding by foreign companies
in New Zealand broadcasters will be introduced to Parliament before
the end of the month.
   The current ratios are a maximum of 15 percent foreign ownership
in television and up to 25 percent for radio.
   The main beneficiary of the move is expected to be the
financially troubled private TV3 network, now operating in
receivership.
   The network, launched just over a year ago as the first private
competition to the two stations run by state-owned Television New
Zealand, attracts an average 15 percent viewing audience.
   The National Broadcasting Co. of the United States owns 7.5
percent of TV3, after reducing its stake from 15 per cent.
   TV3 reported a $28 million million loss for the year ending
March 31.
   Williamson told a news conference that TV3's current financial
predicament had given urgency to the matter.
   Williamson said consideration had been given to a 20 percent
ratio, as in Australia, or the United States figure of 25 percent,
but neither would have been satisfactory.
   ``The existing overseas investment restrictions are now a
serious impediment to the development of the broadcasting industry.
Most large New Zealand companies and institutions have significant
overseas shareholding and it is proving impossible for such
companies to have a worthwhile shareholding in broadcasting
enterprises,'' he said.
   ``The 49.9 percent figure will allow New Zealand broadcasters to
seek equity partners overseas and, along with the equity, they will
be able to seek expertise, which is probably just as important,''
he said.

<HEAD>MCA Rejects Lujan Request to Donate Yosemite Park Concession</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Entertainment giant MCA Inc. rejected a
request by Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. to donate its
concession at Yosemite National Park to the government before its
buyout by a Japanese firm is completed.
   Instead, the Yosemite Park &amp; Curry Co. will be sold within a
year to an American buyer as a result of Matsushita Electric
Industrial Co.'s $6.6 billion buyout of MCA.
   ``We had hoped for better news,'' said National Park Service
spokesman George Berklacy.
   MCA Chairman Lew R. Wasserman said the decision was in the best
interests of shareholders as well as park visitors. MCA agreed to
terms of the buyout by Matsushita last week.
   Lujan asked for the donation in a letter to Wasserman and
Matsushita Executive Vice President Masahiko Hirata on Tuesday.
   But James Ridenour, director of the Park Service, said Wednesday
that MCA and Matsushita attorneys told him that Curry Co. assets
were ``made part of the deal with Matsushita'' and could not be
given away.
   Because of concern toward a foreign firm owning a concession in
a national park, MCA and Matsushita agreed last month to place the
Curry Co. in escrow until a U.S. buyer could be found. In the
meantime, Curry Co. profits will be donated to the National Park
Foundation, a group that channels private money to the Park
Service.
   ``We believe this is a generous gift which will further the work
of the National Park Service,'' Wasserman said in a written reply
to Lujan on Wednesday.
   The company owns about half the restaurants, stores and lodgings
in Yosemite Valley. The National Park Service must approve any
buyer of Curry Co.
   In his letter, Lujan asked the corporations to give the
concession ``to the American people.''
   ``Such a dramatic gesture would be recognized as a remarkably
generous and public-spirited demonstration of the MCA-MEI
commitment to the values of Yosemite National Park and what they
stand for in the minds of the American people,'' he wrote.
   The Curry Co.'s contract with the Park Service expires in 1993.

<HEAD>Moscow Stock Exchange To Open Early Next Year, Russian Minister
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Moscow International Stock Exchange hopes to
begin trading in a limited number of government bonds in January,
Russian Finance Minister Boris Fyodorov said today.
   The government of Russia, the largest and richest of the 15
Soviet republics, was among 20 organizations and individuals which
founded the exchange last month.
   ``We would like to take in the first place a very primitive
step,'' Fyodorov said of the decision to start by trading bonds
before gradually introducing securities. He spoke at a seminar on
Russia's economic future.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev issued sweeping decrees in
October permitting individual Soviets to buy stocks, bonds and
other securities for the first time in 73 years.
   Trading in shares was outlawed following the 1917 Bolshevik
Revolution and allowed only a brief revival during the 1920s before
being abolished by Josef Stalin.
   The Russian-supported exchange is smaller and separate from the
Moscow Stock Exchange founded in November by 187 companies. The
Moscow Stock Exchange has not yet set an opening date, but has
ambitious plans to open offices in the New York, Frankfurt, Tokyo
and Singapore stock exchanges.
   Fyodorov said the Moscow International Stock Exchange has only
10 million rubles, or about $5.5 million, in capital, compared with
61.5 million rubles, or about $34.1 million, for the Moscow Stock
Exchange.
   ``We hope that the first session will be in the beginning of
January with the state bonds,'' he said.
   Bonds, usually issued by governments, are considered less risky
than stocks because they pay the buyer a fixed annual interest rate
and mature at a specified future date.
   Western advisers helping the Soviet government revive trading
say bonds will also be easier for inexperienced investors to
understand.

   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. is appealing
directly to NCR Corp. shareholders to accept its $6 billion
takeover bid for the nation's fifth-largest computer company.
   But NCR said Wednesday it would fight the $90-a-share cash
tender offer unless the phone giant raised the price by $2.5
billion.
   AT&amp;T made its direct offer to NCR shareholders after NCR's
directors, who faced a 5 p.m. EST deadline to respond to the bid,
rejected the offer as ``grossly inadequate.'' But almost
simultaneously, NCR said it would enter into merger talks with AT&amp;T
if the phone company increased its offer to $125 a share, for a
total of about $8.5 billion.
   AT&amp;T disclosed that its chairman, Robert E. Allen, and NCR
Chairman Charles E. Exley Jr. met Wednesday afternoon in New York
at Exley's request. During the meeting, Exley presented the
$125-a-share counterproposal.
   Allen, in a letter to Exley released by AT&amp;T, rejected NCR's
offer.
   ``We do not understand how you can maintain ... that a merger at
$125 in AT&amp;T stock would work, continue NCR's success and be a good
deal for your shareholders, but a merger at $90 would be a
strategic disaster,'' Allen wrote.
   `Chuck, all we have is a difference of opinion on price,'' he
continued. ``We should let your shareholders decide. We believe
that we are offering a full and fair price.''
   AT&amp;T, in a later statement, called the $125-a-share proposal
``outrageous and totally unjstified.''
   The AT&amp;T tender offer would provide NCR shareholders $90 in cash
for each share, while AT&amp;T's earlier offer to the company's board
would have involved exchanging AT&amp;T stock worth $90 for each NCR
share. The tender offer is effective today and runs until midnight
Jan. 4.
   As part of its offer to enter merger talks with AT&amp;T at $125 a
share, NCR also said the phone company must agree to enter into a
confidentialty agreement and to refrain from further action on a
takeover while the talks proceed.
   ``Please understand that if you cannot offer NCR shareholders
this fair value, we will use every means at our disposal to protect
our shareholders and other stakeholders against your attempt to
deny them the inherent values of NCR,'' Exley said in a letter to
Allen released by NCR.
   Last week, the board rejected an earlier AT&amp;T offer of $85 a
share.
   Daton, Ohio-based NCR said its board bolstered NCR's takeover
defenses by lowering the threshold for a shareholders' rights plan
to take effect. Under the change, the right of existing
stockholders to buy special shares in NCR can be exercised after a
company acquires 15 percent of NCR, down from 20 percent. The
special shares are intended to make a takeover more difficult.
   Exley has said he is opposed to AT&amp;T's bid on the grounds it
would not make sense to combine NCR's well-regarded computer line
with AT&amp;T's disappointing computer business. He said he would quit
NCR if AT&amp;T's bid suceeded.
   This morning, NCR's shares began trading at $92.25, up $5.50,
after a delayed opening due to an order imbalance on the New York
Stock Exchange. On Wednesday, NCR shares rose $3.12{ to close at
$86.62{ in heavy trading. News of AT&amp;T's tender offer came after
the close of the markets.
   AT&amp;T shares rose 12{ cents in early trading to $30.25. On
Wednesday, AT&amp;T stock fell 25 cents as more than 5 million shares
changed hands, topping the most-active list on the NYSE.
   Many industry analysts believed Exley's opposition to the
takeover bid was just posturing, and that he was holding out in
order to push up AT&amp;T's offering price. Others believe Exley
geniunely wants to fight to keep NCR independent.
   To battle AT&amp;T's tender offer, Exley has several options,
including seeking another merger partner, taking NCR private by
buying its shares with borrowed money, or arranging a large payout
to stockholders, again through borrowed cash.
   But analysts said the last two options seem unlikely in the
current climate on Wall Street, where bank credit and bond
financing for such deals have all but dried up.
   That leaves finding another merger partner the most likely
course should NCR try to block AT&amp;T's bid, experts say. Such a
partner may offer more favorable terms than AT&amp;T.

   Hopes for an orderly resolution of the impasse
in the Middle East helped propel stock prices sharply higher today.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 32.67 points to
2,643.07 in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 1 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 906 up, 184 down and
348 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 53.93 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The market's yearend rally picked up fresh momentum Wednesday
after word came from the State Department that Iraq had agreed to
hold talks with President Bush on the crisis in the Persian Gulf.
   Today, traders arriving at work were greeted by news that Saddam
Hussein, Iraq's president, had urged his parliament to permit all
foreign hostages stranded by the invasion of Kuwait last summer to
leave.
   Those developments sent oil prices sharply lower, and interest
rates fell in the credit markets.
   Brokers said stocks benefited in particular from hopes that
efforts to pull the U.S. economy out of recession could proceed
without the disrupting influence of the threat of war with Iraq.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Philip Morris, up 1 at
50}; General Electric, up 1\ at 58\; International Business
Machines, up 1&rsqb; at 116, and General Motors, up } at 37~.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.88 to 181.99. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 2.27 at 307.68.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 30.70 to
2,610.40, bringing its gain over the past four sessions to 91.59
points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 2 to 1 on the
NYSE, with 1,064 up, 488 down and 449 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 205.82 million shares, up from 185.82

<TEXT>
   The weak economy and the mammoth costs of
helping the savings and loan industry will soon push the federal
deficit to records surpassing $300 billion per year, a
congressional study said today.
   But by 1993, the newly enacted deficit-reduction law and an
improving economy should begin shrinking the federal shortfall, the
Congressional Budget Office said in a report presented to the House
Budget Committee.
   ``The economy appears to be near a turning point - a time when
predicting its course is particularly difficult,'' said Robert
Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office.
   The calculations are the first showing how the five-year, $496
billion deficit-cutting law will affect the federal budget over the
next several years. The Bush administration is not expected to
release its own figures until February.
   The report, obtained by The Associated Press in advance of the
hearing, said that in fiscal 1992, for which the administration is
planning its budget, the shortfall will be at least $337 billion,
easily the highest ever. Fiscal 1992 begins next Oct. 1.
   But by the following year, the CBO expects the red ink to shrink
to $252 billion and reach $143 billion by 1995, the last year for
which the study contains projections.
   The report cautioned, however, that economic conditions have
worsened since October, when the CBO made its calculations. Oil
prices have remained high, the real estate market has been weak and
many banks and corporations have had financial problems, it noted.
   ``Unless these factors are offset by other developments, a more
pessimistic economic outlook will worsen the budget projections,''
the authors wrote.
   The budget office said it expects the government to spend $91
billion in fiscal 1991 - which runs through next Sept. 30 - bailing
out the nation's savings and loan institutions. That figure will
peak at $107 billion in 1992.
   But then, as the government begins selling S&amp;L assets it has
taken over, it will recoup some of its losses, actually earning $44
billion in 1994, the report said.
   The economy will also take its toll on the budget. As a rule of
thumb, a weak economy means lower federal revenues and higher
spending, and thus a bigger budget gap.
   Many of the CBO's expectations for economic performance have
deteriorated since it released its last projections last summer.
   The budget office now expects the economy to grow at a weak 0.6
percent in 1991, down from its 2.5 percent estimate in July. The
Bush administration is calling for economic growth at around 0.8
percent.
   The report also projected that inflation will increase by 5.3
percent in 1991, 1.1 percent higher than the CBO called for in
July. And it forecast unemployment to be 6.4 percent in 1991, up
from the 5.4 percent projected earlier.
   This year's budget gap should be $320 billion, the CBO said. The
deficit for fiscal 1990 was $220 billion, just below the record
$221 billion shortfall in 1986.
   But those figures cannot be directly compared with the $320
billion projection for next year because they include the huge and
growing Social Security surplus, expected to reach $66 billion this
year.
   Under new budget rules, that surplus is no longer included in
federal deficit calculations. The fiscal 1990 budget gap would have
been $277 billion had the Social Security surplus not been included
in the deficit figures.
   The Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law sets new deficit ceilings
for each of the next few years. If those targets are surpassed,
automatic spending cuts can be triggered.
   But under the new procedures, the administration adjusts those
targets to reflect changing economic conditions, so there is little
threat they will cause the automatic spending slashes to occur.
   The CBO's numbers are advisory and are not officially used to
measure the deficit. That task falls to the White House's Office of
Management and Budget. Nonetheless, the CBO figures are widely
respected on Capitol Hill.

   Oil futures prices tumbled even lower today to
levels not seen since August after Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
said all of his foreign hostages should be released.
   Light sweet crude oil was down $1.79 per barrel to $25.50 at the
New York Mercantile Exchange this morning on contracts for delivery
in January. Crude for next-month delivery last settled below $26
per barrel on Aug. 29, when it was at $25.92, the exchange said.
   Unleaded gasoline for next-month delivery was down 3.34 cents at
65.50 cents a gallon by late this morning. It fell at one point to
within less than a penny of the price it commanded on Aug. 1, the
day before Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   Home heating oil was trading at 77.70 cents a gallon, down 3.44
cents, on contracts for delivery in January.
   The rapid plunge today followed crude's drop of $3.37 per barrel
on Wednesday, which came amid speculation of peace in the Persian
Gulf.
   ``Word came out that Hussein is releasing the hostages and it
fell $1.50, just like that,'' said Ann-Louise Hittle, a senior oil
analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. ``We're seeing an
erosion of the war premium.''
   During the wild downturn that began on Wednesday, all of the
petroleum futures hit levels they had not seen since the month of
the invasion.
   ``It almost feels like we're reversing course,'' Hittle said.
``We're back in a period of uncertainty again.''
   Oil for next-month delivery had not closed below $28 per barrel
since Aug. 31, when it closed at $27.32, the exchange said.
Wednesday's close for gasoline was the lowest since Aug. 2 and the
close for heating oil was the lowest since Aug. 31.
   Prices also skidded today in frantic activity in London on the
news of Saddam's statement on the hostages.
   January contracts for North Sea Brent Blend, the most widely
traded international crude oil, fell to $25.60 a barrel from $27.35
late Wednesday.
   In the four months since Iraq seized Kuwait, speculation about a
war-induced oil crisis has pushed prices as high as the $41 a
barrel level. Many oil strategists have said the market will
continue to act unpredictably until the crisis shows decisive signs
of ending.
   The market swung wildly on headlines Wednesday. A brief rally
led by saber-rattling from Secretary of State James A. Baker III
failed to sustain any buying momentum. Prospects of peace soon took
control and pushed prices down.
   The final shove came in the afternoon, when the U.S. government
announced Iraq had agreed to top-level diplomatic meetings to
discuss the desert standoff.
   ``Although the rhetoric from Bush and Baker is still pretty
tough, at least now there's going to be some kind of discussion
between the two parties and the ground rules are becoming
clearer,'' said Christian Gohler, a broker at Merrill Lynch Energy
Futures.

   Trading in crude oil futures would be
temporarily suspended in response to large price swings, under a
plan approved today by the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   ``For the first time, the exchange will be imposing trade
cessations as circuit-breakers,'' President R. Patrick Thompson
said. The proposed changes would allow crude oil futures to rise or
fall by up to $15 per barrel each day, far more than they have ever
moved.
   Exchange officials said they are not trying to predict movements
that big, but rather setting up rules that will keep trading
orderly through a crisis.
   The exchange also offers futures contracts for two refined
petroleum products, unleaded gasoline and home heating oil, that
will be affected.
   The possibility that war or peace in the Persian Gulf could lead
to huge movements in oil prices has prompted some calls for tighter
controls on the exchange.
   But exchange officials said in a news conference this morning
that the proposed rules changes, which they expect to be approved
by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission next week, were
``self-imposed.'' The exchange has nonetheless discussed the rule
changes with the CFTC ahead of time.
   ``We were not goaded into this by any federal agency,'' Chairman
Z. Lou Guttman said. ``We felt that this was a very responsible and
necessary precautionary measure.''
   Under the new rules, if oil prices swing $7.50 in either
direction during a single trading session and stay at that level
for five minutes, oil brokers will be told that trading will be
halted in two minutes. After the market is stopped for an hour,
trading will resume, with the swing in prices limited to $15 for
the spot month and the month after that.
   If futures for unleaded gasoline and home heating oil move 20
cents a gallon, their trading would be stopped and then resumed
with a 40-cent-a-gallon limit on moves for the rest of the session.
   Prices have never swung as wildly as the new limits would allow
them to swing, and exchange officials emphasized they are not
trying to predict the size of the swings that would be possible
during a sudden oil emergency.
   The exchange came up with the price limits by figuring out what
kind of swings the market could withstand while keeping trading
orderly and fair, the officials said.
   Exchange officials said the hour's break in trading would give
futures players time to take a closer look at world events that are
pushing the price of crude.

   The stock market advanced broadly today,
inspired by hopes for an orderly resolution of the impasse in the
Midle East.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 30.70 points
Wednesday, climbed 19.06 to 2,629.46 by 11 a.m. today.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by nearly 4 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 1,065 up,
288 down and 413 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 115.96 million shares at
midmorning.
   The market's yearend rally picked up fresh momentum Wednesday
after word came from the State Department that Iraq had agreed to
hold talks with President Bush on the crisis in the Persian Gulf.
   Today, traders arriving at work were greeted by news that Saddam
Hussein, Iraq's president, had urged his parliament to permit all
foreign hostages stranded by the invasion of Kuwait last summer to
leave.
   Those developments sent oil prices sharply lower, and interest
rates fell in the credit markets.
   Brokers said stocks benefited in particular from hopes that
efforts to pull the U.S. economy out of recession could proceed
without the disrupting influence of the threat of war with Iraq.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Philip Morris, up 1 at
50}; General Electric, up 1 at 58; International Business Machines,
up ~ at 115{, and General Motors, up | at 37}.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.42 to 181.53. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 1.82 at 307.23.

   Government regulators do not have an effective
system to manage the consultants hired to sell real estate
inherited from failed savings and loans, the head of the General
Accounting Office said today.
   ``One of our key concerns is that the RTC (Resolution Trust
Corp.) does not have an effective contractor oversight program,''
Charles A. Bowsher, head of the congressional investigative agency,
told the House Banking Committee.
   ``Because of the large dollar value of assets to be placed under
contractor control, we believe it is essential that an effective
system be put in place as quickly as possible to assure proper
contract management and oversight, and minimize RTC's vulnerability
to fraud, waste and mismangement,'' he said.
   Bowsher's testimony came a day after the Democratic staff of the
committee issued a report charging that RTC red tape is tangling
the sale of S&amp;L assets and costing taxpayers millions of dollars.
   ``Investors and would-be homeowners have encountered innumerable
stumbling blocks in their attempts to negotiate purchases of
RTC-held assets,'' said the report, released Wednesday. An RTC
spokesman called the findings ``nonsense.''
   The report conceded that the 16-month-old RTC ``has been
assigned a difficult task in cleaning up the largest financial
crisis in the nation's history.'' But it said the agency must
develop a better sales effort if it is to succeed.
   ``Uncooperative property managers, difficulties in obtaining
current and accurate appraisals, delays in contract negotiations,
deteriorating condition of assets and a simple inability between
RTC and many potential buyers to effectively communicate have
delayed or prevented the closing of countless transactions, costing
the federal government millions of dollars in carrying costs while
billions of dollars worth of unsold properties continue to
deteriorate,'' the report said.
   ``Congressional offices have been inundated with letters from
frustrated investors, brokers and homebuyers who have found that
purchasing property from the RTC is not a simple case of arriving
at mutually acceptable terms of sale, but rather involves hours of
sifting through paperwork and bureaucratic red tape, often leading
to frustration and disappointment,'' it said.
   RTC spokesman Stephen Katsanos called the report ``nonsense.''
From the RTC's creation in August 1989 through Sept. 30, it has
taken over 493 S&amp;Ls with $251 billion in assets, he said. At the
end of the period, it was left with 207 institutions and $142
billion in assets.
   ``We've moved assets roughly the size of Citicorp back into the
private sector,'' Katsanos said. ``I think it's been a pretty
productive year.''
   He said some buyers may be frustrated because they want to
privately negotiate a purchase at a bargain-basement price rather
than compete against other bidders.
   ``That's not what Congress asked for in the legislation,'' the
spokesman said. ``There are a lot of complainers out there, but
there also are a lot of happy people who have bought stuff.''
   However, Richard Buerkle, an Arlington, Texas, real estate
executive, told the committee that lower-level RTC staff actually
doing the agency's work complain they do not have enough authority
to make decisions on properties, that too much paperwork is
required and that top officials have little knowledge about how to
sell real estate.
   Attempts by top policymakers to improve the sales effort are
``bureaucratic, more control, more documentation,'' he said.
   Bertram Lewis, a real estate executive who teaches at Columbia
University's Graduate School of Business, said RTC account officers
who deal with sour loans and real estate on a day-to-day basis are
either ex-regulators or former low-level bankers who ``seem to lack
the experience, confidence, incentive, authority and temperament to
make a deal.''
   The agency has hired outside consultants who are dealmakers,
Lewis said. ``Unfortunately, they cannot make decisions - only
recommendations, which are then subjected to the red tape and
time-consuming review of the bureaucracy.''

<HEAD>Grand Met Posts 25 Percent Profit Gain, Thanks to Pillsbury, Burger
King</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grand Metropolitan PLC, the British food and
liquor company, said Thursday its annual net profit jumped 25
percent, helped by the inclusion of Pillsbury Co. and Burger King's
full-year results for the first time.
   Grand Met said net profit for the year ended Sept. 30 came to
634 million pounds, or $1.07 billion, compared with 508 million
pounds, or $859 million, in the same period a year ago.
   Pretax profit rose 26 percent to 919 million pounds, or $1.55
billion, from 732 million pounds, or $1.24 billion.
   Revenue rose only 1 percent, however, to 9.394 billion pounds,
or $15.9 billion, from 9.298 billion, or $15.7 billion.
   Grand Met blamed the small revenue gain on asset disposals,
notably its retail betting and Berni restaurant operations. Revenue
from its continuing businesses was up 19 percent, it said.
   The company did not report results for the latest quarter or
second half of the year. It isn't required to under British law.
   Grand Met said part of the earnings gain for 1990 reflected the
inclusion of full-year results from Pillsbury and Burger King, an
increase from nine months of results included in 1989. Grand Met
acquired Pillsbury, which owned Burger King, for $5.7 billion in
early 1989.
   Profit before tax and other considerations for Grand Met's food
operations rose 26 percent to 309 million pounds, or $522 million,
in 1990.
   Pillsbury alone increased its contribution to 183 million
pounds, or $309 million, from 117 million pounds, or $198 million.
   Trading profit from Grand Met's liquor division rose 22 percent
to 473 million pounds, or $799 million, while the retailing
division posted the fastest growth. The 29 percent rise to 278
million pounds, or $470 million, included a 64 percent jump in
profit by Burger King to 125 million pounds, or $211 million, due
partly to lower overhead costs and improved operating efficiency.
   All figures were converted at a company-provided exchange rate
of $1.69 to the pound.
   ``The group has had another successful year; all sectors have
overcome adverse economic conditions to report good growth,'' said
Grand Met Chairman Sir Allen Sheppard.
   He noted that Pillsbury, including Burger King, had positive
earnings in its first full year in the group, and said it continues
to perform excellently.
   Sheppard said the company expects further earnings improvements
in 1991, although he said it will be ``potentially a difficult
year, with the translation impact of a weak dollar on our
considerable U.S. earnings, fewer property disposals and an
increased tax charge.''

<TEXT>
   Saddam Hussein's call for the release of foreign
hostages touched off an early rally in stocks and a decline in oil
prices today, but the moves fizzled quickly as traders awaited more
news on the Persian Gulf.
   President Bush told a news conference during a visit to
Santiago, Chile, that he viewed the hostage report as a hopeful
sign. But he said the United States had ``to keep the pressure on''
Saddam to withdraw from Kuwait as well as release the hostages.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average of 30 blue-chip
stocks leaped more than 30 points in the first 15 minutes of
trading, then fell back to the 2,613 level by noon EST, up about 3
points from Wednesday.
   Volume exceeded 163.3 million shares by midmorning in heavy
trading.
   Oil prices plunged by more than $2 per barrel in early trading
on the New York Mercantile Exchange, but edged back by noon to
$26.30 per barrel for January delivery, down 99 cents from
Wednesday's close.
   Gold, which had been a safe haven for some nervous investors,
also fell by more than $4 per ounce to around $370, and the dollar
was lower in foreign exchange dealings.
   Bond prices rose strongly with the Treasury's 30-year bond
moving up about $3.75 per $1,000 face amount in the early going.
But by noon, the advance was cut to less than $1.25 per $1,000. The
yield on the bond, which moves in the opposite direction from its
price, fell to 8.30 percent from 8.31 percent late Wednesday.
   Saddam's initiative heightened the markets' expectations for
peace in the Persian Gulf, which has been in turmoil since Iraq
invaded Kuwait Aug. 2.
   The market movesbegan earlier this week after Bush set a process
in motion for talks with Iraqi leaders.
   Saddam called today for the release of all hostages, saying
recent diplomatic moves had prompted him to ``respond to positive
changes,'' according to the Iraqi News Agency.
   Saddam also said the hostages' presence was no longer needed to
deter an attack because his forces were now fully deployed in
Kuwait.
   There are thousands of Western hostages in Iraq and Kuwait,
including about 900 Americans.
   Speculation about peace had sent oil futures to their lowest
levels since August on Wednesday with crude for January delivery
falling $3.37 per barrel to settle at $27.29 on the Mercantile
Exchange. The Dow Jones average climbed 30.70 points on Wednesday
to the highest point in 12 weeks.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hanson PLC, the British industrial conglomerate
with extensive interests in the United States, said Thursday its
annual after-tax profit rose 19.4 percent, thanks to healthy
results from most of its operating units.
   After-tax profit for the year ended Sept. 30 reached 971 million
pounds, or $1.64 billion, compared with 813 million pounds, or
$1.37 billion, a year ago.
   Net profit fell to 501 million pounds, or $847 million, from 764
million pounds, or $1.29 billion. The company had an extraordinary
credit of 288 million pounds, or $487 million, in 1989 for
disposals of Consolidated Gold Fields properties.
   Hanson acquired Gold Fields for $5.9 billion in 1989, and the
disposals have since generated some $1.91 billion.
   Hanson's pre-tax profit rose 21 percent to 1.28 billion pounds,
or $2.16 billion, from 1.06 billion pounds, or $1.79 billion.
   Sales rose 2.3 percent to 7.15 billion pounds, or $12.1 billion,
from 6.99 billion pounds, or $11.8 billion.
   The figures were converted at a rate of $1.69 to the pound, the
average exchange rate in the year ended Sept. 30.
   The company did not report results for the latest quarter or
second half of the year. It is not required to do so under British
law.
   Company Chairman Lord Hanson forecast the good results will
continue despite the worldwide economic downturn because ``our
strategy to face these circumstances has been prepared for some
time.''
   He also said the company continues to be expansion-minded. ``Our
large cash balances and borrowing capability mean that we have the
resources,'' he said. ``Combining these with our expertise and
knowledge of the market, we shall undoubtedly find an increasing
number of acquisition opportunities.''
   The company's U.S. unit, Hanson Industries, said trading profit
rose 18 percent to 416 million pounds, or $703 million, on sales of
3 billion pounds, or $5.1 billion.
   ``Even in the difficult economic climate, some 20 individual
(Hanson) companies reported record profits,'' said the unit's
chairman, Sir Gordon White.
   The company's U.S. interests include SCM Chemicals, Jacuzzi
whirlpool baths, Kaiser cement, Ames garden tools and Peabody Coal,
which Hanson acquired control of in the spring.

   Pet Inc. said Thursday it will close its
frozen pie factory in Michigan Feb. 3, the first of several plant
closings the company expects to announce in coming weeks.
   The Frankfort plant's 115 employees will be offered a severance
package, said plant manager Don Olney. Production of Pet-Ritz pies,
cobblers and other goods will be moved to other factories.
   Pet's parent, Whitman Co., announced in September that it was
spinning off Pet as a subsidiary and would consolidate Pet
operations. Pet posted third-quarter income of $45 million, down
from $63 million in the third quarter of 1989.
   Pet spokesman Les Landes said the food company, which has about
25 plants nationwide, has too much production capacity. More
closings or consolidations will be announced in the next several
weeks, Landes said.
   Olney said employees were shocked when he told them Wednesday
afternoon that their jobs were being eliminated.
   ``It was a sad day yesterday,'' Olney said. ``Most of them are
in shock. It's very hard for them to believe. This was their
livelihood.''

   An ambitious program of world trade
talks was rescued from the brink of collapse today after the
European Community showed a willingness to discuss greater cuts in
farm subsidies.
   Officials attending the Uruguay Round of negotiations decided to
continue their talks rather than suspending them immediately
because of a bitter dispute between the Community and the United
States over the subsidies.
   ``The meeting decided we should go to work ... that we should
continue the negotiations,'' Frans Andriessen, the community's top
trade official, said after an hour-long session of negotiators.
   He said the 12-nation trading bloc ``made some movement'' and it
was sufficient for the bargaining to continue.
   The talks appeared near collapse earlier in the day because of
the deadlock between the United States and European nations over
farm issues.
   ``I definitely think a cooling-off period might help the
(European Community) achieve a mandate,'' U.S. Trade Representative
Carla Hills said after a round of morning sessions.
   There was a stalemate in agricultural issues, she said, ``and it
would be very constructive if we had a quiet period.''
   But the Europeans promised to show new flexibility and rejected
the drift toward suspending the current Uruguay Round of world
trade talks.
   While details on the Europeans' new offer were sketchy, it
appeared they were offering to discuss a U.S. demand for
across-the-board reductions in subsidies.
   ``The impasse was broken,'' said David Woods, spokesman for the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the organization conducting
the negotiations.
   Canadian Trade Minister John Crosbie, who earlier in the day had
said chances for successfully concluding the talks appeared all but
doomed, said: ``It's not a breakthrough. It's a reprieve.''
   Canada is a member of the Cairns Group of 14 major exporting
countries who along with the United States have been pushing the
Europeans to agree to major cuts in subsidies.
   Australian Trade Minister Neal Blewett said the European
proposal offered a ``glimmer of hope. Things are no longer
terminal.''
   The announcement that after four days of stalemate the talks had
gained new life came suddenly following a closed-door session of
the trade negotiators held to determine whether there was any use
of proceeding further.
   The Europeans have offered to cut 30 percent from subsidies on
major crops over 10 years, starting retroactively in 1986, in order
to reduce their farmers' advantage over foreign producers and make
imports more competitive.
   The United States' demand is for subsidy cuts of 75 percent to
90 percent over the next decade.
   At stake in the talks, convened by the 107-nation conference of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, are more
access to world markets for poor and newly democratizing countries,
protection against copyright theft, and extension of fair-trade
rulesto agriculture, banking and textiles.
   By Washington's calculation, agreement could lead to a doubling
of world trade by the end of the decade. Trade now amounts to $3.8
trillion annually.
   But in the corridors of the Heysel Palaces, where the talks are
being held, delegates argued fiercely late Wednesday over who was
responsible for the slide toward a collapse or suspension of GATT.
   More than 1,500 delegates, many of them Cabinet members
including four from Washington, attended the conference that
started Monday and was to end Friday.
   The talks are named the Uruguay Round after the country where
they started in 1986 with the goal of liberalizing trade in 15
areas.
   Backed by agriculture-dependent countries in the Third World,
the United States, Canada, Argentina, Brazil, Australia and others
want the EC to make deep cuts in subsidies that have made the EC's
10 million farmers into potent exporters. The subsidies distort
world farm trade, reformers argue.
   GATT was established in 1947 as a forum for promoting free
trade. The current round of talks, the eighth since World War II,
aims to extend free trade rules to areas not under current GATT
rules, such as farm products, textiles and services such as
financial services and construction.

<HEAD>New Moscow Stock Exchange Hopes to Open Doors in January</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE SHEPHERD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new Soviet stock exchange founded with the help
of the Russian republic hopes to start trading bonds in January,
Russian Finance Minister Boris Fyodorov said Thursday.
   The Moscow International Stock Exchange is separate from a
larger stock exchange founded in November. The two, possibly
competing exchanges are the first to operate in the Soviet Union
since dictator Josef Stalin banned them in the 1920s.
   The reform-minded Russian government was joined by 19 other
organizations and individuals to found the newest exchange last
month, Fyodorov told a seminar on economic reforms in Russia, the
largest and richest Soviet republic.
   The exchange will start with bonds and later will begin trading
shares, Fyodorov said.
   ``We would like to take in the first place a very primitive
step,'' Fyodorov said. ``We hope that the first session will be in
the beginning of January with the state bonds.''
   Many Western experts advising the Soviet Union on how to revive
and operate stock exchanges have recommended they start with bonds,
rather than equities, to give the national and republic governments
time to privatize factories and other means of production.
   Bonds, issued by governments and corporations, are considered
less risky than stocks because they pay the buyer a fixed interest
rate and can be redeemed at a specified future date.
   David Darbyshire, a partner in Arthur Andersen, the
international services company that sponsored the seminar, said
bonds are also easy to understand.
   He said the fledgling Soviet markets need some early successes
to encourage confidence and investor interest.
   ``In the early stages of the exchange it will be critical that
only those companies which have a fair chance of success should be
allowed onto the marketplace,'' he said.
   Among those most frequently mentioned are the state airline
Aeroflot, the Intourist travel agency and the oil and gas
industries.
   Trading in stocks and bonds was outlawed following the 1917
Bolshevik Revolution, forcing the closure of an active,
200-year-old exchange in St. Petersburg. A Moscow stock exchange
and commodity exchanges were allowed a brief revival during the
1920s before being abolished.
   In October, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev issued sweeping
decrees restoring Soviets' rights to buy stocks, bonds and other
securities.
   The Moscow Stock Exchange was founded in November by 187
independent companies and without any government body. That
exchange said it would hold a trial bidding session in the spring.
It has has 61.5 million rubles, or $34.1 million, in capital.
   By comparison, Fyodorov said the Moscow International Stock
Exchange has 10 million rubles, or about $5.5 million, in capital.
   Russia's role in forming the Moscow International Stock Exchange
appeared to reflect the divergent economic agendas of the
independent-minded republics.
   Latvia on Thursday passed its own law legalizing ``shareholder
societies,'' something other republics also have done. Latvian
lawmakers warned investors to adhere to Latvian, rather than
Soviet, law, according to the independent news agency Interfax.
   Meanwhile, the new Moscow Commodity Exchange said this week it
has hired an American grain expert to develop its grain and
agricultural commodities section.
   It said Myron Laserson, former president of the North American
Export Grain Association, will head a Soviet-American team to
develop and implement an efficient trading mechanism.
   A Russian Commodity Exchange begn trading in Moscow this week
and plans are in the works for both stock and commodity exchanges
in Leningrad.

<HEAD>Miners Fight to Save 1872 Law and Public Land Claims at $2.50 per
Acre</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Miners are fighting congressional
efforts to reform an 1872 law allowing them to claim public land
for $2.50 an acre. Opponents say it's a relic of the Old West that
makes modern land-grabbing easy.
   Supporters argue that changing the law could put thousands of
miners out of work and cripple one of the nation's basic
industries.
   ``The mining industry is in trouble. It's in deep trouble in the
Congress of the United States,'' said Bill Grannell, executive
director of the Western States Public Lands Coalition in Pueblo,
Colo.
   The coalition of miners, logging interests and ranchers who use
federal land, mostly in the West, has launched a petition drive to
preserve the Mining Law of 1872.
   The law allows hardrock miners to stake claims on public land,
pay no royalties on extracted minerals and obtain title to claims
for as little as $2.50 an acre.
   Hardrock minerals include gold, silver, uranium, copper, lead
and zinc. The U.S. Bureau of Mines says there are about 130,000
active hardrock miners nationwide.
   The law was designed to promote mineral exploration and
development on federal land, which covers 724 million acres, mostly
in 11 Western states and Alaska. It applies to everyone from lone
prospectors to major mining companies.
   Reform proponents say they will introduce legislation in
Congress to make miners pay royalties similar to those paid by
companies that lease land from the government to extract oil, coal
and natural gas.
   Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., will submit a bill like one he pushed
last session, and Rep. Nick Rahall, D-W.Va., will bring a similar
bill to the House, aides said.
   The bills would end the so-called patent provision that allows
miners to work the land and eventually obtain title to it at 1872
prices - $2.50 to $5.00 an acre.
   Under the current law, prospectors need to have spent $500 on a
claim to qualify for a land patent. Critics of patenting cite a
1989 General Accounting Office report that cited abuses and huge
private and corporate profits.
   In one example, holders of the title to 17,000 acres near Grand
Junction, Colo., several years ago paid the government $42,500 for
the land, then turned around weeks later and sold it to major oil
companies for $37 million.
   The GAO said one 40-acre site near Mesa, Ariz., patented in 1983
for $100, is now valued at $400,000.
   The Bumpers bill also would charge miners royalty fees and
require them to post large bonds to guarantee their ability to
repair any environmental damage.
   Miners say boosting their costs that much would force many out
of business.
   In 118 years, more than 6 million mining claims have been filed
with the government, and 1.2 million are still active. Nevada has
the most, 370,000. Arizona has 143,000, Utah 113,000, Colorado
80,255 and Alaska 32,000.
   Miners have obtained title to 84,000 acres in Colorado, mostly
in oil shale deposits. They gained title to 11,158 acres in Nevada,
14,475 in Montana, 16,796 in Wyoming and 8,406 in Alaska.
   ``Mining is destroying a lot of public land in this country,''
said Laura Lapins of the Mineral Policy Center in Washington, which
is pushing for reforms.
   The law enacted during the presidency of Ulysses S. Grant
doesn't fit in a modern world where the wilderness is disappearing
and environmental damage is mounting, said Dave Alberswerth of the
National Wildlife Federation.
   ``That law is simply an anachronism in this day and age,'' he
said. ``It is the last remaining land disposal act on the books.''

<HEAD>Truck Maker Reports $7 Million Loss for Quarter; $11 Million Loss
For Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Navistar International Corp. said Thursday it
lost $7 million in the fourth quarter and reported a loss for the
year, due to reduced demand for medium and heavy trucks.
   The Chicago-based truck maker said it lost 6 cents a share in
the quarter ended Oct. 31, compared to a loss of $13 million, or 8
cents a share, in the fourth quarter of 1989.
   Revenues fell 4 percent, to $971 million vs. $1.01 billion.
   For the year, Navistar lost $11 million, or 16 cents a share,
compared with net income of $87 million, or 23 cents per share, for
fiscal 1989. Revenues were $3.85 billion, down 9 percent from $4.24
billion the previous year.
   James C. Cotting, Navistar's chairman and chief executive
officer, said the principal factor behind both the lower demand for
trucks and the company's losses was a slower U.S. economy.
   During the fiscal year, medium and heavy truck sales in North
America totaled 281,800 units, down 15 percent from 331,500 units
in 1989.
   Navistar said shipments of mid-range diesel engines to original
equipment manufacturers totalled 100,700 engines for the year, down
6 percent from the 106,700 engines shipped in 1989.
   Despite the decline in sales, Cotting said Navistar was able to
increase its industry-leading share of the medium- and heavy-truck
market from 27.4 percent to 27.9 percent.
   He said the company's projections for 1991 anticipate continued
weakness in demand for medium and heavy trucks. He said the company
has adjusted its production schedules to the lower demand outlook,
and will move to reduce costs to lower the company's break-even
point.

<HEAD>Expectations of Soviet Business Boosts Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed higher in
light trading Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade on
expectations credits soon will be extended to the Soviet Union to
buy U.S. grains.
   Hearings Wednesday by a U.S. House Agriculture subcommittee
indicated the Soviets could be offered credits of about $1.25
billion.
   William Biedermann, an analyst with Allendale Inc. in Chicago,
said those reports, as well as rumors of increased bookings of
ocean vessels for exports, helped fuel the gains in the market.
   Biedermann said the strong ocean vessel market was an indication
the Soviets may be pricing grains for purchase.
   Also boosting the market was the improved tone in the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks taking place in Brussels.
   The European Community showed a willingness to discuss greater
cuts in farm subsidies, and officials attending the negotiations
decided to continue their talks rather than suspend them.
   At stake in the talks are more access to world markets for poor
and newly democratizing countries, protection against copyright
theft, and extension of fair-trade rules to agriculture, banking
and textiles.
   At the close, wheat was 1\ cents to 3 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $2.46{ a bushel; corn was a \
cent to } cent higher with December at $2.26 a bushel; oats were 1{
cents to 2 cents higher with December at $1.11} a bushel; soybeans
were 3 cents to 5 cents higher with the contract for delivery in
January at $5.97$ a bushel.

   The stock market was mixed in heavy trading
today, responding uncertainly to visions of an orderly resolution
of the impasse in the Middle East.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than 20 points
in the early going, was down 14.36 at 2,596.04 by 3 p.m. on Wall
Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 862 up, 662 down and
480 unchanged.
   The market's yearend rally picked up fresh momentum Wednesday
after word came from the State Department that Iraq had agreed to
hold talks with President Bush on the crisis in the Persian Gulf.
   Today, traders arriving at work were greeted by news that Saddam
Hussein, Iraq's president, had urged his parliament to permit all
foreign hostages stranded by the invasion of Kuwait last summer to
leave.
   Those developments drove oil prices lower, and interest rates
fell in the credit markets.
   Brokers said stocks benefited in particular from hopes that
efforts to pull the U.S. economy out of recession could proceed
without the disrupting influence of the threat of war with Iraq.
   But after an initial burst of enthusiasm, investors seemed to
sit back to await more concrete evidence that more peaceful times
lay ahead.
   NCR, which is opposing a $90-a-share takeover bid by American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph, rose 5| to 92\. AT&amp;T shares slipped &lsqb; to 30.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
.66 to 179.45. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .92 at 306.33.
   Volume on the Big Board reached 227.76 million shares with an
hour to go.

<HEAD>Economic Growth Slowing Overseas, Conference Board Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world's leading industrial nations - with
the exception of Germany - are expected to suffer economic declines
in 1991 as credit tightens around the globe and trade subsides, the
Conference Board said Thursday.
   The latest data show the leading economic indicators are flat or
declining in nine of the world's top 11 industrial nations, the
board said.
   While Germany is ``the only country that seems immune from the
current rash of pessimism,'' Conference Board Chief Economist Gail
Fosler noted that the unification euphoria ``will wear off once tax
increases are announced to fund the rapidly escalating cost of east
German econonic development.''
   Fosler predicted growth in Japan will be about 3.5 percent next
year, well off from initial estimates of 5 percent. In France,
growth is ``expected to be as little as 2-2.5 percent,'' she said
in a release.
   Canada and Australia are expected to register economic declines
in the latter half of this year, while the verdict on Britain ``is
still out'' after a third-quarter decline.
   Among the factors influencing the decline overseas are slowing
investment growth and consumer spending in Europe; high interest
rates and a falling stock market in Japan; banking, finance and
real estate problems in many major countries; and a downturn in
world trade.
   ``Interest rates must come down substantially outside the U.S.
in order to preserve growth'' in world trade, she said.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls Worldwide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell on world currency markets
Thursday as the prospects for war dimmed following Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein's offer to release Western hostages.
   Gold prices also fell. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold
settled at $371.70 a troy ounce, off $2.50 from Wednesday. Later,
Republic National Bank quoted a late bid for gold at $371, off
$1.75.
   The market interpreted Hussein's offer ``as a sign war tensions
were easing, and the dollar fell sharply,'' said Marc Chandler, an
analyst with the firm IDEA. The dollar typically is viewed as a
safe-haven currency during times of world turmoil.
   But as the session wore on, Chandler said it became more clear
to traders that Hussein was actually prepared for war and made the
offer because his troops are now fully deployed in Kuwait. That
assessment helped the dollar firm a bit around midday, but it then
languished for the remainder of the session.
   ``The market was supporting the dollar on a war premium and took
it down on a peace premium,'' said Michael Malpede, a senior
analyst at Refco Group Ltd. in Chicago.
   Also pressuring the dollar was anticipation over the release
Friday of November unemployment data. Analysts expect the Labor
Department report will show an increase in initial jobless claims
and a higher overall unemployment rate for the month.
   ``That will further confirm the slowdown of the U.S. economy and
add pressure on the Federal Reserve to ease interest rates,''
Chandler said. Lower interest rates erode the value of
dollar-denominated securities and therefore decrease investors'
need for the U.S. currency.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 134.05 Japanese yen from
133.42 yen on Wednesday. Later in London, it fell to 132.35 yen. In
New York the dollar settled at 132.14 yen, down from 133.63 yen on
Wednesday.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.9390 from $1.9225 late
Wednesday. In New York it cost $1.9400 to buy one pound, more
expensive than Wednesday's $1.9260.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.4885 German marks, down from 1.4993;
1.2710 Swiss francs, down from 1.2795; 5.0510 French francs, down
from 5.0770; 1,122.25 Italian lire, down from 1,127.68, and 1.1621
Canadian dollars, down form 1.1630.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late
Wednesday's rates included: 1.4890 German marks, down from 1.5025;
1.2725 Swiss francs, down from 1.2835; 5.0540 French francs, down
from 5.0898; 1.6805 Dutch guilders, down from 1.6955; 1,122.25
Italian lire, down from 1,130.75, and 1.1621 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1623.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $370.25 a troy ounce,
from $372.65 bid late Wednesday. In Zurich, the metal fell to a
closing bid of $369.50, from $374.50. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold
fell $2.80 to close at a bid $374.24.
   Silver prices also declined. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery settled at $4.121 a troy ounce, down from
$4.148 on Wednesday. In London the metal was unchanged at a late
bid price of $4.16 a troy ounce.

<HEAD>Rose $1.02 Billion in Latest Week to New Record</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Interest rate figures reported by Donoghue's Money Fund Report
are for week ended Tuesday. All other figures are for the week
ended Wednesday.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Assets of the nation's 533 money market mutual
funds rose by $1.02 billion in the latest week to an all-time high
of $424.89 billion, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   The rise in the seven-day period ended Wednesday came despite an
easing of interest rates that generally tend to make money-market
fund investments less attractive relative to stocks and bonds.
   The fund-asset total broke the record set the previous week,
when the figure reached $423.87 billion. That total originally was
reported as $423.76 billion but the institute subsequently revised
it upward.
   ``Despite further moderate easing of yields offered by money
market funds, their assets continued to climb,'' said Jacob Dreyer,
vice president and chief economist of the institute, a
Washington-based mutual fund trade group.
   ``So far, neither rising stock and bond prices nor the
anticipation of future decliens in short-term interest rates had a
discernible inhibiting effect on flows of assets into money market
funds,'' he said.
   The institute said that in the latest week, assets of 265
general purpose funds rose by $303.8 million to $150.32 billion;
assets of 104 broker-dealer funds rose by $147.3 million to $166.53
billion; and assets of 164 institutional funds rose by $570.8
million to $108.04 billion.   The seven-day average yield on money market
mutual funds in the
week ended Tuesday was 7.27 percent, unchanged from the previous
week, said Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade journal based in
Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 7.31 percent from 7.34 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
52 days, up from 50 days, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual
yield available on money market accounts fell to 5.98 percent as of
Wednesday from 5.99 percent a week earlier. The North Palm Beach,
Fla.-based newsletter said the effective annual yield available on
special savings accounts, called Super NOW accounts, was 5.07
percent, unchanged from a week earlier.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.50
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 7.53
percent the previous week. Yields were 7.60 percent on 1-year CDs,
down from 7.62 percent; 7.70 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 7.73
percent; and 7.95 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 7.97 percent.

<HEAD>Oil Market Would Briefly Halt Trading During Big Price Swings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIRK BEVERIDGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trading in crude oil futures would be
temporarily suspended in response to large price swings, under a
plan approved Thursday by the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   The plan, to be considered by federal regulators, would also
limit the amount oil could rise or fall each day to $15 per barrel
and the amount gasoline or home heating oil could rise or fall to
40 cents a gallon each day.
   Exchange officials told a news conference that the plan was
developed to ensure orderly trading in volatile situations, such as
a war in the Persian Gulf, which could push prices higher, or a
sudden outbreak of peace, which could send prices into a steep
decline.
   The officials denied bowing to any pressure from regulators or
criticism that speculators were profiteering from wide swings in
the futures market.
   ``We were not goaded into this by any federal agency,'' said
Merc Chairman Z. Lou Guttman said. ``We felt that this was a very
responsible and necessary precautionary measure.''
   But oil market traders said the plan was aimed at heading off
tighter regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
   ``Rather than have the CFTC close the exchange during war, we
could claim there are circuit-breakers,'' said Christian Gohler, a
broker at Merrill Lynch Energy Futures. ``That's the only redeeming
quality.''
   David Geary, a CFTC spokesman, said the commission had not yet
received the complete proposal from the exchange, but he said the
matter would be considered quickly. Exchange officials said they
expected the plan to be approved by next Wednesday.
   A prominent critic of oil pricing, Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman,
D-Conn., said the exchange's plan was a small step in the right
direction. But he said he would favor a government shutdown of the
oil market if war broke out.
   ``A $15-a-barrel increase in one day is still huge and
unacceptable,'' Lieberman said in a telephone interview. But
Lieberman praised the exchange officials for acknowledging ``they
have some obligation to try to limit the increases in the price of
oil due to panic.''
   Oil traders pointed out that any limits at the exchange would
not stop a big move by crude, because there are no limits at the
futures markets in London and Singapore or in the spot market where
buyers pay cash for oil at loading docks.
   Many doubt the exchange's limits would ever come into play,
because they are so wide.
   ``It's going to be in effect limitless trading, which is the way
the free markets are supposed to operate,'' said Brian Tagler, an
oil broker at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
   The largest one-day move oil futures have made in New York
occurred on Oct. 22, when crude dropped $5.41 per barrel, largely
in response to a rumor that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had a
dream in which a prophet told him his missiles were pointed the
wrong way. The oil market took that to be a sign of peace in the
Middle East.
   Exchange officials said they were not trying to predict oil
prices would move $15 daily after a war broke out. They said the
figure set conservative limits for the normal functioning of the
market. Beyond those limits, market participants might be unable to
meet their obligations as buyers and sellers.
   Under the new rules, if oil prices swing $7.50 in either
direction during a single trading session and stay at that level
for five minutes, oil brokers would be told that trading would be
halted in two minutes. After a trading halt of one hour, trading
would resume, with the swing in prices limited to another $7.50 for
a total of $15. The limits would affect contracts for the two
nearest delivery months.
   Trading of unleaded gasoline and home heating oil futures would
follow a similar pattern with a maximum move of 40 cents a gallon
in either direction on the two nearest months.
   The exchange currently has no limits on moves made by contracts
for next-month delivery of oil, although there are limits on outer
months.
   Exchange officials said the hour's break in trading would give
futures players time to take a closer look at world events that are
pushing the price of crude.

<HEAD>American General Rejects Bids for Partial Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American General Corp.'s board of directors on
Thursday rejected two bids for its home service insurance
subsidiaries and took the units off the sales block.
   The board also authorized the resumption of its stock repurchase
program suspended since talk of a possible sale began last May.
   Harold S. Hook, chairman and chief executive of the
Houston-based financial services company, said the higher of the
two bids opened Tuesday was $3.65 billion, of which $1.8 billion
would cover the assumption of corporate debt.
   ``Under this proposal, American General shareholders would have
received about $15 per share in a combination of cash and
securities of the acquiring company,'' Hook said. ``The board
concluded that this proposal fell short of the value of these
operations.''
   Trading in American General stock was halted temporarily on the
New York Stock Exchange Thursday pending the announcement. It fell
$1.50 for the day, closing at $28.87{ per share.
   American General, with $34 billion in assets, is one of the
nation's largest providers of life insurance, retirement plans and
consumer loans.
   The company put itself up for sale in May amid speculation it
could be the target of a hostile takeover.
   When no potential buyers came forward to purchase the company as
a whole, American General set a Dec. 3 deadline for bids for part
of the company as well as the company as a whole. But by Tuesday it
had received only two bids for the home service subsidiaries and
none for the whole company.
   Hooks said after considering the proposals and the company's
future, the board agreed that continuing the sale process ``is not
likely to be productive'' and instead would be ``detrimental to the
business of the company.''
   American General has paid about $1 billion to repurchase about
20 percent of its stock outstanding as of April 1, 1987, when it
initiated its repurchasing plan. The plan was suspended last May
when the sale process was begun.
   Besides voting to resume the repurchase program, American
General's board set a new annual common dividend rate of $2 per
share in 1991, a 27 percent increase over the $1.58 annual rate in
effect before May.
   In May, the company had set a rate of 80 cents per quarter to
give shareholders an additional return while waiting for a sale to
be completed.
   Torchmark Corp., a Birmingham, Ala.-based insurance firm, has
been trying to acquire all or a part of American General since
March, when it informally proposed more than $6 million. The offer
was turned down by American General officials, who said the company
was worth more.

   The stock market turned in a mixed showing
Thursday in the heaviest trading in more than a year as investors
took a wary view of Middle East peace prospects.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up about 30 points in
the early going, was down 7.92 at 2,602.48 by the close.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 4 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
869 up, 710 down and 456 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 256.38 million
shares, up from 20.82 million Wednesday and the heaviest total
since aa 416.29 million-share day on Oct. 16,1989.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 308.93 million shares.
   The market's yearend rally picked up fresh momentum Wednesday
after word came from the State Department that Iraq had agreed to
hold talks with President Bush on the crisis in the Persian Gulf.
   On Thursday, traders arriving at work were greeted by news that
Saddam Hussein, Iraq's president, had urged his parliament to
permit all foreign hostages stranded by the invasion of Kuwait last
summer to leave.
   Those developments pushed oil prices lower, and interest rates
fell in the credit markets.
   Brokers said stocks benefited in particular from hopes that
efforts to pull the U.S. economy out of recession could proceed
without the disrupting influence of the threat of war with Iraq.
   But after an initial burst of enthusiasm, investors seemed to
sit back to await concrete evidence that more peaceful times lay
ahead.
   NCR, which is opposing a $90-a-share takeover bid by American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph, rose 6&lsqb; to 92&rsqb;. AT&amp;T shares were unchanged
at 30&lsqb;.
   International Business Machines was a principal drag on the Dow
Jones industrial average, falling 3&lsqb; to 111{ on negative comments
by at least one analyst who follows the company.
   Energy stocks also were weak. Atlantic Richfield dropped 4| to
122{; Chevron 1\ to 69}; Mobil 1&rsqb; to 56{; Amoco 1 to 50&rsqb;; Exxon |
to 49|, and Texaco ~ to 57|.
   Airline issues, by contrast, extended their recent upturn on
prospects of cheaper fuel costs. UAL gained 2{ to 106&rsqb;; AMR 1&lsqb; to
52&rsqb;, and Delta Air Lines 1 to 60|.
   American General, which said it ended an effort to find a buyer
for parts or all of its operations, dropped 1{ to 28~.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $3.38 billion, or 0.11
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .40 to 179.71.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell .47 to 384.86, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was down .85 at 329.07.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
1.42 to 372.29. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 306.35, up .94.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil prices fell for a second straight session
Thursday to levels not seen for months, with the plunge based on
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's promise to free all hostages.
   Light sweet crude oil dropped 89 cents to $26.40 per barrel at
the New York Mercantile Exchange on contracts for delivery in
January. Oil for next-month delivery had not been that cheap on the
exchange since late August.
   Unleaded gasoline futures fell 2.24 cents to 66.60 cents a
gallon for January delivery. At one point, gasoline was below 65
cents a gallon, within a fraction of a penny of the price it
commanded on Aug. 1, the day before Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   Home heating oil was down 1.43 cents to 71.91 cents a gallon.
   A day earlier, all of the futures contracts dropped to levels
they had not traded for since the month of the invasion. They kept
falling Thursday, though not as sharply.
   ``We're seeing an erosion of the war premium,'' said Ann-Louise
Hittle, a senior oil analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. ``I
think the market is just registering this change in the situation
and trying to establish a new base.''
   Oil had fallen even farther in early trading Thursday, but it
regained some ground during the afternoon. Traders were responding
in part to continued harsh rhetoric from U.S. officials, but some
began buying oil again when they decided crude must have hit
bottom, at least for the time being.
   The oil market has been overwhelmingly bearish since last
Friday, when President Bush offered to hold diplomatic meetings
with ranking Iraqis in an effort to convince Saddam that he must
get his troops out of Kuwait.
   Analysts have said the demise of much of the war premium has
been accentuated by increased oil production that has some
countries stuck with millions of barrels of crude they cannot
immediately sell.
   But the threat of war still carried some weight in the oil pits.
   Crude had been down more than $2 a barrel before President Bush
held a news conference in Santiago, Chile, that was construed as
bullish. Bush said release of the thousands of hostages would not
weaken American resolve to get Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.
   That sparked a rally, but it was unable to pull oil all the way
back up.
   Natural gas, which is not directly affected by the turmoil in
the Middle East, also dropped Thursday. It closed down 5.1 cents at
$2.351 per 1,000 cubic feet on contracts for January delivery.

<HEAD>Gold, Energy Continue to Take Cues from Gulf Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Developments in the Persian Gulf crisis continued to control the
direction of the precious metals and energy markets Thursday. They
both lost ground as the rhetoric by world leaders waxed both
conciliatory and bellicose.
   Gold futures for February delivery plunged $4.10 a troy ounce in
early trading before recovering somewhat, while energy futures
followed the same pattern.
   On other markets, livestock and pork futures were mixed, and
grains and soybeans were higher.
   Gold on New York's Commodity Exchange opened sharply lower on
word the Iraqis will release foreign hostages held since the
occupation of Kuwait, said William O'Neill, an analyst with Merrill
Lynch Futures Inc. in New York.
   O'Neill said gold futures began to show improvement after
President Bush's comments that Iraq must leave Kuwait ``without
reservation, without conditions'' before the gulf crisis can end.
   Gold settled $2.30 to $2.60 lower with the contract for delivery
in February at $373.20 a troy ounce; silver was 2.7 cents to 3.5
cents lower with January at $4.136 a troy ounce.
   Brian Tagler of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in New York said
the energy market mirrored gold's movement.
   ``The market was counting on Bush to be unbending and figured
that would send the market back up, and he was,'' he said.
   Tagler said that while the Persian Gulf crisis is primarily
controlling the movement of energy prices, he noted that there is
an underlining bearish tone to the market.
   He noted that Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states have more than
made up for the loss of Kuwaiti and Iraqi oil production.
   ``There is a lot of crude out there, and demand is soft,''
Tagler said, adding that in the long term, energy futures will
continue to be pressured.
   Light sweet crude was 23 cents to 94 cents lower with January at
$26.40 a barrel; heating oil was 1.16 cents to 3.55 cents lower
with January at 79.71 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 1.80
cents to 3.13 cents lower with January at 66.50 cents a gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed higher in light trading
on the Chicago Board of Trade on expectations that credits soon
will be extended to the Soviet Union to buy U.S. grains.
   Hearings Wednesday by a U.S. House Agriculture subcommittee
indicated the Soviets could be offered credits of about $1.25
billion.
   William Biedermann, an analyst with Allendale Inc. in Chicago,
said those reports, as well as rumors of increased bookings of
ocean vessels for exports, helped fuel the gains in the market.
   Biedermann said the strong ocean vessel market was an indication
the Soviets may be pricing grains for purchase.
   Also boosting the market was an improved tone early on at world
trade talks in Brussels. The European Community had shown a
willingness to discuss greater cuts in farm subsidies, and
officials attending the negotiations decided to continue their
talks rather than suspend them.
   Later on, however, after the markets closed, the EC rejected a
last-minute compromise proposal to make significant subsidy cuts,
and the talks were close to collapse.
   At stake in the talks are more access to world markets for poor
and newly democratizing countries, protection against copyright
theft, and extension of fair-trade rules to agriculture, banking
and textiles.
   Wheat was 1{ cents to 3{ cents higher with December at $2.47 a
bushel; corn was 1\ cents lower to 1 cent higher with December at
$2.25} a bushel; oats were 1{ cents to 2 cents higher with December
at $1.11} a bushel; soybeans were 3 cents to 5{ cents higher with
the contract for delivery in January at $5.97\ a bushel.
   Livestock futures were mixed and pork futures mostly lower on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Cattle futures were boosted by high cash prices, which are
trading at a premium to futures, said Charles Levitt, an analyst
with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in Chicago.
   Pork futures were pressured by the steady marketing of hogs by
farmers, and the heavier than normal weight of hogs being
slaughtered. The heavier hogs mean more pork is available to the
market than normally is the case, Levitt said.
   Live cattle were .02 cent to .30 cent higher with December at
79.27 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower to .50 cent
higher with January at 88.22 cents a pound; live hogs were .62 cent
lower to .12 cent higher with December at 49 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were 1.02 cents to 1.25 cents lower with February at
62.85 cents a pound.

<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended Nov. 26, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,324.5 billion from a revised $3,319.1 billion the
previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted
$4,089.7 billion from a revised $4,082.7 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $825.5 billion from $823.7 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The growth rate in M2 in the last 52 weeks was 3.8 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The growth rate in M3 over the past year was 1.4 percent, which is
within the Fed's target range of 1 percent to 5 percent. The Fed
has not set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,320.0 billion, a 3.6
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,089.9 billion, up 1.0 percent, while M1
rose 5.2 percent to an average of $821.5 billion.
   In other reports:
   -The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $112 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from
$184 million the previous week.
   -The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $319.9 billion in the two-week period ended
Nov. 28, up from $318.7 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>NEC Strengthens Overseas Supercomputer Marketing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NEC Corp. said Thursday it will create new sales
divisions in Germany and Japan to boost its overseas marketing of
supercomputers.
   While NEC and two other Japanese supercomputer makers, Fujitsu
and Hitachi, together have sold more than 200 supercomputers, the
vast majority have been ordered in Japan.
   NEC's new European supercomputer division, based in Cologne,
Germany, hopes to sell 30 of the company's new SX-3 supercomputers
over the next four years, company officials said. That would
approximately double the number of Japanese supercomputers in place
overseas.
   NEC says the SX-3, which it recently began shipping, is the
world's fastest computer in some benchmark tests. It plans to sell
120 of the multimillion- dollar machines worldwide, including 40
outside Japan.
   NEC has sold only one supercomputer in the United States, and
some officials charge that Japanese machines have been unfairly
excluded from U.S. government procurement programs.
   A U.S. trade official negotiating access for U.S. supercomputers
to Japanese procurement programs said earlier this year that Japan
should ``do as we say, not as we do'' regarding open government
purchasing. He also said U.S. supercomputers, made primarily by
Cray Research Inc., still had an overall performance advantage.
   But many industry analysts believe that gap has greatly
narrowed, and some believe it has disappeared.
   In the United States, NEC will continue to market its
supercomputers through its HNSX Supercomputers sales subsidiary,
the official said.
   The new marketing division in Tokyo will provide worldwide sales
and technical support, NEC said.
   Supercomputers are high-speed computers designed to handle large
numbers of repetitive scientific calculations in areas such as car
design, weather forecasting, aerospace and defense.

<HEAD>VCR Maker Challenges MCA Buyout on Antitrust Grounds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The $6.6 billion buyout of MCA Inc. by a
giant Japanese electronics company is being challenged in an
antitrust lawsuit by a small Arizona manufacturer of a dual-deck
videocassette recorder.
   Go-Video Inc., of Scottsdale, contends Matsushita Electric
Industrial Co.'s pending deal is part of a conspiracy with Sony
Corp. and oher Japanese companies to monopolize the world market
for electronics hardware - VCRs, televisions, and audio gear.
   The lawsuit, filed Thursday, asks the federal court in Phoenix
to block the buyout on grounds it violates U.S. laws designed to
encourage competition.
   The action grows out of earlier lawsuits by Go-Video, which is
counting on sales of its patented, dual-deck VCR-2 for survival. It
began selling the machine, billed as the world's first such device,
last July.
   The lawsuit touches on the sensitive issue of how Japan has
taken control of the consumer electronics business from the United
States.
   The primary objective of the Japanese companies is to dominate
the yet-to-emerge high-definition television market, said Joseph M.
Alioto, a lawyer for Go-Video.
   ``These guys are looking 20 years down the road,'' Alioto said
in a telephone interview from San Francisco.
   Matsushita spokeswoman Joele Frank declined immediate comment,
saying the company's lawyers hadn't finished reviewing the lawsuit.
MCA spokeswoman Christine Hanson said the company never comments on
lawsuits.
   Much has been made of the fact that the purchase of MCA, the
parent of Universal Studios, would give Matsushita movies,
television shows and recordings to complement its consumer
electronics products.
   Sony Corp. used the strategy last year in purchasing Columbia
Pictures for $3.4 billion. The Korean electronics giant Samsung
Group was reported Thursday to be interested in a similar purchase
of Orion Pictures.
   Alioto said the Japanese companies intend to use their
domination of both sides of the entertainment business to ensure
that ``Go-Video's products will not play their software, and
anybody else (outside Japan) who makes HDTV won't either.''
   Go-Video already is pursuing its conspiracy claim in an earlier
lawsuit against Matsushita and its Panasonic division; Victor Co.
of Japan Ltd. and its JVC Corp. subsidiary; Sanyo Electric Co.
Ltd.; Sony; and NEC Corp.
   Go-Video contends the companies have formed a cartel to control
the consumer-electronics market.
   In an unrelated development, MCA said it would sell its Yosemite
Park &amp; Curry Co. to an American buyer rather than give the national
park concession to the U.S. government before the buyout by
Matsushita.
   MCA Chairman Lew R. Wasserman turned down a request by Interior
Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. for donation of the company, which has
the concession contract at Yosemite National Park until 1993 and
owns about half of the restaurants, stores and lodgings in Yosemite
Valley.
   James Ridenour, director of the Park Service, said Wednesday he
had been told that Curry Co. assets were ``made part of the deal
with Matsushita'' and could not be given away.
   Because of the foreign ownership issue, MCA and Matsushita
agreed last month to place the Curry Co. in escrow until a U.S.
buyer could be found. In the meantime, Curry Co. profits will be
donated to the National Park Foundation, a group that channels
private money to the Park Service.
   ``We believe this is a generous gift which will further the work
of the National Park Service,'' Wasserman wrote to Lujan.

<HEAD>Union Rallies Against Nordstrom Labor Practices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of the United Food and Commercial Workers
Union rallied in Seattle and other cities Thursday to protest what
they called labor abuses by the retailer Nordstrom Inc.
   About 90 union members and supporters gathered at a downtown
Seattle park before marching six blocks to hand out leaflets in
front of the clothing retailer's flagship store.
   UFCW Local 1001 President Joe Peterson, whose union has been
battling Nordstrom for more than a year and a half, told the
gathering, ``We're here today to let Nordstrom employees know we're
fighting for their right to earn a living under decent working
conditions.''
   Few current Nordstrom workers attended the Seattle rally.
Peterson said Nordstrom employees didn't turn out because they are
afraid of being harassed by the company.
   Peterson outlined what he said were past and present abuses by
the company. The allegations include forcing employees to perform
services without pay, discriminating against workers over 40,
pregnant women and blacks, trying to deny unemployment benefits to
former workers, and seeking to limit information to employees and
the news media about its treatment of workers.
   Nordstrom spokesman Tim Doke called the union's allegations
``nonsense.''
   Doke said union rallies were reported in Los Angeles; San
Francisco; Portland, Ore.; and in Tyson's Corner, Va. near
Washington, D.C.
   Local 1001 represents about 1,700 workers at six Seattle-area
stores. Nordstrom employs more than 30,000 people at 62 stores in
Washington, Oregon, Alaska, Utah, California, Virginia and New
Jersey.
   Two Nordstrom workers who attended the rally in Seattle were
Diane Aldrich, who works at the Seattle Northgate mall store, and
Kathleen Sargent, from the downtown Seattle store. Both said they
are members of Nordstrom Employees Opposed to Union Representation,
an employee group seeking a vote to decertify UFCW representation.
   Aldrich said most of the allegations mentioned by the union had
been settled.
   ``I couldn't be upset with what I heard today because it's all
old news,'' she said.
   Aldrich said she didn't understand the union's allegations about
discrimination. She said she works with blacks and pregnant women
at Northgate, and that ``I'm 44 and I've only worked there a
year.''
   Last month, the National Labor Relations Board rejected appeals
by Local 1001 to overturn settlements reached by Nordstrom and the
federal agency.
   In the settlements, Nordstrom agreed to post notices promising
not to penalize employees for union activity, not to bargain with
workers directly and not to withhold information sought by the
union for negotiations.
   After the notices have been posted 60 days, Nordstrom may be
found in compliance with the settlement, the NLRB said. At that
point, employees could start circulating petitions for an election
on whether to retain the union. Peterson, however, has said the
decertification effort would be blocked by the filing of new unfair
labor practice charges.
   Action on petitions to decertify a union are barred while any
unfair labor practice charges are pending.
   Peterson has said that fewer than half the workers represented
by his local are union members.
   Local 1001's contract with Nordstrom expired July 31, 1989,
after company negotiators refused to accept renewal of a provision
requiring employees covered by the contract to belong to the union.
   Last winter, the union filed suit seeking more than $300 million
in back pay for Nordstrom employees nationwide.
   A separate but similar union complaint resulted in a state
Department of Labor and Industries ruling in February that
Nordstrom failed to pay some workers for attending company
meetings, writing thank-you notes to customers, making deliveries
and performing other functions on their own time.

   Saddam Hussein's offer to free foreign hostages
jolted financial markets Thursday, inciting a brief rally on Wall
Street and a drop in oil prices on hunches of a breakthrough in the
4-month-old Persian Gulf crisis.
   But President Bush's skeptical response and insistence that the
Iraqi leader's troops vacate Kuwait doused the initial enthusiasm.
Many strategists said it was premature to conclude war had become a
remote possibility.
   ``I think the market feels we're taking a step closer to
peace,'' said Gary N. Ross, president of consulting activities at
Petroleum Industry Research Associates in New York. Nonetheless, he
said, ``you've got to expect the market is going to continue to be
volatile. Peace isn't necessarily at hand.''
   The Iraqi leader said all foreign hostages would be freed
because of what he called diplomatic advances in resolving the
crisis that began after he seized Kuwait Aug. 2. That invasion led
to United Nations sanctions and a major U.S. military deployment
that has threatened to escalate into war.
   Bush, at a news conference during a trip to Santiago, Chile,
said Saddam should never have taken hostages and that he must
withdraw from Kuwait unconditionally before the crisis can end.
   By the end of the day the price of oil, which initially plunged
more than $2 a barrel on the hostage-freedom offer, ended with an
89 cent loss at $26.40 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, the best-known
barometer of Wall Street, finished down 7.92 points to 2,602.48.
The average had been up over 30 points in the first 15 minutes of
trading.
   ``I was sort of stunned that we ended down, 40 points
essentially,'' said John Eberley, a stock trader at the Chicago
Corp. investment company. ``My guess is that Bush's posture,
nothing less than absolutely withdrawal, spooked some people.''
   In the bond market, a sensitive barometer of interest rates and
the economy's direction, the key 30-year Treasury bond also ended
with loss after rising sharply on the Iraqi hostage announcement.
   Gold prices and the dollar, historically considered safe ways to
protect money during times of political and economic travail, also
ended with losses, which some trading professionals attributed to
the prospects of peace.
   ``The dollar's advantage as a safe haven currency is the reason
for its unfortunate demise, at least temporarily,'' said Zlatko
Glamuzina, chief currency dealer at the New York branch of the
Banco di Sicilia.
   ``The war premium is down,'' Glamuzina said. ``If I am an
investor, the dollar is not the greatest currency to park my
money.''
   In the precious metals market, gold prices, which lately have
been following the behavior of the oil market, fell about $2.50 a
troy ounce to about $372, but that is considered an insignificant
drop.
   Some strategists said the decline in gold would have been
greater if the Iraqi leader had begun freeing hostages instead of
simply suggesting they would be released at an unspecified time.
   ``If he does the release the hostages, he loses a major chip,''
said Nelson Colton, president of the precious metals group at
A-Mark Precious Metals, a leading wholesaler based in Los Angeles.
``The general opinion is when he does it, we'll believe it.''
   Others said the financial market behavior reflected other
influences, particularly signs of weakness of the American economy
that is discouraging U.S. investments.
   ``People are using any opportunity, any good news out of the
Persian Gulf to lighten up,'' said John Hickey, treasurer at the
New York branch of Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, a Finnish banking
company.

<HEAD>Ousted CenTrust Chairman Fights Bond Payment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ousted CenTrust Chairman David Paul went back to
court Thursday in an effort to get out of posting a $30.8 million
bond that would cover lavish spending by the failed thrift.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision ordered Paul to put up the
cash, and Paul failed Tuesday to persuade a judge to throw out the
order. Paul's attorneys responded by asking for a stay of the
ruling and filing notice of appeal late Thursday, which could
eventually put the case before the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Atlanta.
   ``Since we expect the government to do whatever it can to hurt
David Paul, contempt or whatever, we are trying to get the ruling
stayed,'' attorney Sanford Bohrer said.
   After the government seized CenTrust in February, regulators
questioned spending that included $29 million for paintings, $15
million on a legal defense fund for officers and directors, $5
million for Paul's retirement and a laundry list of ritzy equipment
and furnishings for the 47-story CenTrust tower in downtown Miami.
   Paul also spent $129,000 in bank funds to bring French chef Paul
Bocuse and other notables to prepare a banquet at his Miami Beach
mansion, and CenTrust insured a clambake against rain at Paul's
Connecticut home, authorities said.

<HEAD>Texas Radioactive Waste Handler Accused of Stock Fraud</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   A federal judge in Texas froze a Houston
company's assets Thursday after regulators charged it had bilked
investors out of at least $350,0000 with false claims about a deal
to dispose of low-level radioactive waste in Africa.
   Houston-based FMF Corp. also falsely claimed to have had a deal
with a pharmaceutical company to dispose of 30,000 tons of
contaminated waste, according to a civil lawsuit brought by the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
   In the lawsuit, filed at federal court in Houston, the SEC
accused FMF Corp. and three top officers of fraud scheme in which
they either deliberately misled investors or recklessly disregarded
whether the information they supplied was true or false.
   Under the recently passed Securities Enforcement Remedies and
Penny Stock Reform Act, the stock market watchdog agency is seeking
a court order to freeze the defendants' assets and make them pay
restitution to investors and fines to the government.
   William McLucas, head of the SEC's Enforcement Division, said
the action was the first brought by the agency under the new law
which empowers the SEC to seek fines for securities crimes other
than insider trading.
   He said the law allows the SEC to seek up to $500,000 in fines
from a company for each alleged violation, although the agency has
not quantified how many violations allegedly occurred.
   Named as defendants in the suit in addition to the company were:
FMF's chairman, Abraham A. Greenspan, and its president, B.F.
Winborn, both of Houston; and the company's vice president of
operations, Charles W. Brandes, of Sealy, Texas.
   There was no one in FMF's offices to provide comment Thursday
afternoon.
   U.S. District Judge Sim Lake in Houston has issued a temporary
restraining order freezing the corporation's assets and prohibiting
further sale of any more interests until the suit is resolved. Lake
set a Dec. 17 hearing.
   Among the false information allegedly supplied investors, the
SEC charged the defendants said:
   - the United States had a treaty with Equitorial Guinea allowing
the storage of low-level radioactive waste in the West African
nation when no such treaty exists.
   - FMF had a concession from Equitorial Guinea to bury up to 2
million tons of ``radon gas impregnated'' waste within its borders
when Equitorial Guinea has not given that permission to anyone.
   - FMF had a contract with Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly &amp; Co. to
dispose of 30,000 tons of contaminated material in Africa when
Lilly has never done business with FMF.
   ``It is our belief and our allegations that they never engaged
in this business at all. This appears to be a total sham to us,''
said Therese D. Pritchard, an SEC attorney handling the case.
   SEC officials said the case was referred to them by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission.
   The SEC also charged that FMF did not tell investors, as
required under securities law disclosure rules, that Greenspan, the
FMF chairman, was barred from practicing law in Texas in 1980, was
convicted of fraudulently obtaining a $1 million bank loan in 1989
and filed for personal bankruptcy in 1988.

   Talks among 107 nations trying to draft
an ambitious global trade pact neared collapse Thursday night after
the European Community rejected a last-minute compromise making
significant cuts in farm subsidies.
   Trade ministers suggested the EC's action virtually dooms any
chances for reaching a trade agreement this week in Brussels.
However, many said they will campaign Friday for holding more
discussions after a cooling-off period.
   However, such a strategy runs a high risk of failure, given
tight deadlines imposed by the U.S. Congress for approving any
final outcome under so-called ``fast-track authority.''
   The battle between the United States and its trade allies on one
side and the 12-nation European Community on the other turned out
to be the biggest stumbling block to getting an overall agreement
in the trade talks.
   In a last-ditch attempt to rescue the negotiations, Swedish
Agriculture Minister Mats Hellstrom, chairman of the farm
negotiating panel, put forward a proposal that represented a
compromise between the drastic cuts in farm subsidies being sought
by the United States and the minimal offer of the EC, which was
trying to protect its 10 million mainly small farmers.
   The talks, known as the Uruguay Round for the country where they
began in 1986, had stalled in what was to have been the final week
of bargaining.
   The talks are being held under the auspices of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, also known as GATT.
   Hellstrom suggested across-the-board cuts of 30 percent in
internal farm supports, export subsidies and market barriers over a
five-year period.
   But the Hellstrom proposal brought strong objections almost
immediately from Community officials.
   Other countries who objected the proposal were South Korea and
Japan, which would have been forced to open its closed rice market
to foreign imports under the proposal.
   ``You will find that among ministers, opinion strays from
`monstrous proposal,' `shocking paper,' `twice what the community
has agreed to,''' said EC Agricultural Commissioner Ray MacSharry.
Talking to reporters, he refused to be specific about what other
cuts the EC was willing to make.
   U.S. negotiators are pushing for cuts of 75 percent in internal
price supports and market barriers and 90 percent reductions in
export subsidies over a 10-year period.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills suggested the United
States would be willing to accept smaller percentage reductions as
long as it obtained binding commitments from the EC to make
reductions in all three areas.
   The United States and some other major exporting countries,
including Canada, have been pushing the Europeans to relent and
agree to major cuts in subsidies.
   Without movement on agriculture, it is likely the trade talks
will be suspended, perhaps for up to a month.
   Neal Blewett, the Australian trade minister, said it is now time
for the countries to turn their attention to trying to rescue the
overall trade package by setting up a fall-back meeting, possibly
in January.
   The United States had insisted such a strategy was risky, given
a March 1 deadline imposed by Congress for submitting a complete
deal and the necessary time to put the nearly 300-page document in
shape.
   The reduction in farm subsidies is being pushed hard by the Bush
administration. Washington sees the change as a boost to American
farm exports as well as those of many farm-based Third World
nations, which cannot compete with the huge subisidies offered by
the developed world.
   More than 1,500 delegates, including four members of Bush's
Cabinet, have been taking part in the negotiations, which began on
Monday and were scheduled to end on Friday.
   GATT was established in 1947 as a forum for promoting free
trade. The current round of talks is the eighth since World War II.

   Continental Airlines officials made misleading
comments about the troubled carrier's plans to seek bankruptcy
protection in an effort to prop up its stock value, according to a
lawsuit filed Thursday.
   Former chairman Frank Lorenzo and others artificially inflated
the market price of Continental stock by denying in interviews with
the news media that the nation's fifth-largest airline was
considering filing for bankruptcy protection, according to the
lawsuit filed on behalf of shareholders.
   Continental disputed the allegations.
   ``As far as this airline is concerned, that suit is utterly
without merit,'' spokesman Art Kent said from Houston. ``In no way
were our shareholders or the public misled by any statements that
were made. At the time those statements were made, we had no intent
to file for protection under Chapter 11.''
   Continental filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors on
Monday, saying it was forced into bankruptcy court by soaring fuel
costs and mounting interest payments on its $6.2 billion debt.
   The shareholders lawsuit, a class action filed in U.S. District
Court, was brought on behalf of investors who purchased Continental
stock between Oct. 24 and the airline's bankruptcy filing.
   The shareholders said that during this time period, airline
officials publicly denied their intention to seek bankruptcy
protection even though ``such action was continually under
consideration as a solution to Continental's worsening liquidity
and other financial problems.''
   The lawsuit accuses the airline officials of violating
securities laws and seeks unspecified damages because of losses on
investments.
   According to the lawsuit, Continental stock fell from $3.62{ per
share to $2 per share after the bankruptcy filing.
   In addition to Lorenzo, the lawsuit names Jan Carlzon, chairman
of Scandinavian Airlines System, Continental's largest shareholder;
Continental chairman Carl R. Pohlad; and Hollis Harris, president
and chief executive officer of Continental.

<TEXT>
   American Telephone and Telegraph Co. has filed
federal lawsuits in Maryland and Ohio seeking to block NCR Corp.
from fighting a hostile $6.1 billion takeover attempt by the
telephone giant.
   AT&amp;T spokeswoman Paula Horii said the lawsuit filed Thursday in
U.S. District Court in Columbus, Ohio, seeks to prevent NCR from
stalling AT&amp;T with requests for information.
   The Baltimore action, filed late Wednesday in U.S. District
Court, also names NCR, which is chartered in Maryland, and Maryland
Attorney General J. Joseph Curran, who has opposed corporate
takeovers.
   AT&amp;T asked a federal judge to bar NCR and Curran from using the
Maryland Business Combination Act or other state laws to stop AT&amp;T
from acquiring enough NCR stock, or shareholder proxies, to take
over the Dayon, Ohio-based computer maker.
   The Maryland law would impose a five-year moratorium on
acquiring enough stock or proxies to force a takeover.
   AT&amp;T has issued a tender offer of $90 per share for NCR common
stock, which the lawsuit said is ``a premium of nearly 90 percent
over the market price of NCR's common shares.''
   NCR Chairman Charles E. Exley has told AT&amp;T his company would
not consider a tender offer of less than $125 per share.
   NCR spokeswoman Connie Olasz said the company has not yet seen
the lawsuits and could not comment on them.
   Olasz said NCR's board of directors on Wednesday voted to opt
out of a Maryland state law in an attempt to block AT&amp;T from
calling a special meeting of NCR shareholders to vote on the tender
offer.

<TEXT>
   Faced with rising local wages and
other problems, foreign corporate investors withdrew $110 million
from South Korea in the first nine months of 1990, the Finance
Ministry said Friday.
   Approvals on new foreign capital investment in South Korea from
January to September totaled $632 million, down 26.9 percent from
the same period last year, ministry officials said.
   The total amount of foreign capital investment remaining in
South Korea was listed at $5.66 billion at the end of September.
   Withdrawals of direct foreign investment from the country
totaled $75 million in 1989 and $48 million in 1988. It was not
known how many foreign businesses were involved in the capital
withdrawals in the past three years.
   The declines were attributed to worsening investment conditions
such as steep local wage hikes, labor unrest and a slowdown in
local economic growth.
   Even many Korean businesses in recent years have relocated
manufacturing and other operations to other countries where labor
is available at lower cost without unrest.

<HEAD>Steel Company Presents Reorganization Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ERIE, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. on Thursday
asked a federal judge to confirm a reorganization plan to keep the
company in business by giving $600 million in cash to creditors.
   Executives of the nation's 10th-largest steelmaker said at a
hearing before U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Warren Bentz the plan will
allow the company the remain competitive with other steel
companies.
   Under the proposed reorganization, unsecured creditors would be
paid 72 cents per $1 of debt.
   The remaining challenger to the plan is a joint interest of the
U.S. Farmers Home Administration and Equibank, which is owed $44
million.
   Bentz on Thursday dismissed a claim by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, which sought to force Wheeling-Pittsburgh to
place pollution-control devices on its mills.
   The agency wanted Wheeling-Pittsburgh to place cash in an escrow
account for the machinery, but Bentz said the agency would have to
sue in another court for such an order.
   The plan before the judge would create two corporations - a
holding company, Wheeling-Pittsburgh Corp., chaired by New York
investor Ronald LeBow, who purchased 86 percent of secured debt;
and an operating company, Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp.
   Liquidating the company's assets would be unsound, said James T.
Gibbons, Wheeling Pittsburgh's director of reorganization and
planning.
   Gibbons estimated the value of a liquidated Wheeling-Pittsburgh
at $860 million to $870 million. In contrast, the reorganized
company would be worth at least $1.1 billion, he said.
   Gibbons told Bentz that Wheeling-Pittsburgh is a leaner, more
competitive company than the one that filed for protection from its
creditors in 1985.
   A major step toward recovery was the closing of the Monessen
steel mill, which was operating at 30 percent capacity, Gibbons
said. The mill was sold in 1988 to other steel makers.
   Wheeling-Pittsburgh employs 7,100 people in Ohio, West Virginia
and Pennsylvania.
