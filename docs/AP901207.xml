   Millonario norteamericano perseguido en Costa Rica desaparece
en Nicaragua
   Por Rodolfo GarcDia
   MANAGUA, 7 (AP) - John Hull, millonario norteamericano
prDofugo de la justicia costarricense descubierto el lunes
residiendo en una ciudad del sureste nicaraguense, ``desapareciDo
misteriosamente'', dicen hoy diarios locales.
   ``Estamos apresurando los trDamites a travDes de nuestra
embajada en Managua para solicitar la extradiciDon de Hull, que
tendrDa que enfrentar la justicia costarricense'', dijo el
miDercoles por telDefono a un diario nicaraguense el asesor legal
de la cancillerDia de ese paDis, Alvaro JimDenez.
   Hull estDa acusado en los tribunales de justicia costarricense
por ``actos hostiles contra el estado, homicidio calificado y
trDafico ilegal de drogas y armas''.
   En la dDecada de 1960 Hull llegDo a Costa Rica y comprDo una
finca de mDas de 607 hectDareas, muy cerca de la frontera con
Nicaragua.
   SegDun versiones periodDisticas, Hull se naturalizDo
costarricense en 1984, ``para burlar la enmienda (del congreso
norteamericano) Boland que prohibDia al gobierno de Estados
Unidos y sus ciudadanos apoyar, financiar o trabajar con los
rebeldes antisandinistas conocidos como `contras'''.
   En marzo de 1984 se mencionDo a Hull como contacto directo de
agentes de la Central de Inteligencia de Estados Unidos en Costa
Rica, que asesoraban a los jefes de la Resistencia Nicaraguense.
   Posteriormente, en mayo de 1984 se le involucrDo en la
explosiDon de una bomba en el campamento La Penca, desde donde el
jefe militar de la antisandinista Alianza Revolucionaria
DemocrDatica (ARDE), EdDen Pastora, dirigDia las acciones contra el
rDegimen sandinista de Nicaragua.
   En ese atentado murieron cinco personas, incluso dos
periodistas norteamericanos, y resultaron 27 heridos, incluso
Pastora.
   Hull huyDo de Costa Rica cuando se le investigaba sobre su
presunta participaciDon en el trDafico de armas y narcDoticos y su
vinculaciDon con la Resistencia Nicaraguense.
   El lunes, un periodista del diario prosandinista Barricada,
lo descubriDo en la ciudad de Juigalpa, 137 kilDometros al este de
la capital y al preguntarle sobre su situaciDon con la justicia
costarricense, Hull contestDo: ``AquDi no hay nada, no pueden
hacer nada'' e inmediatamente partiDo en su camioneta.
   Las autoridades de migraciDon confirmaron a los periodistas
que Hull se encontraba en el paDis desde el 31 de agosto en
``calidad de turista'', pero no podDian arrestarlo mientras el
gobierno costarricense en forma oficial no lo solicitara.
   DespuDes de la publicaciDon de Barricada, Hull y una hija
adoptiva que le acompaInaba desaparecieron y no han sido vistos
en Juigalpa, donde sostuvieron entrevistas con autoridades
locales y lDideres de la antigua resistencia nicaraguense, segDun
se informDo.

   Homicide among young black men and teen-agers in
America is rapidly worsening, federal health officials said.
   In 1988, 2,741 black males from 15 to 24 were slain in homicides
in the United States, CDC epidemiologist Dr. Robert Froehlke said
Thursday.
   The killings, based on preliminary figures, would translate to a
homicide rate of 101.1 for every 100,000 black males 15-24, up 67
percent from the 1984 rate of 60.6. While homicides decreased among
young black men in the early 1980s, the rate has skyrocketed since,
the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control said in a report
Thursday.
   Rates for females and white males of that age ``have either
stayed essentially the same, or in fact decreased a little bit,''
Froehlke said. ``The disparity between black males and other groups
has widened even more.''
   In 1987, the latest year for complete statistics have been
compiled, the homicide rate for young black males was 84.6, some
six times higher than the rate for all Americans 15-24, which was
13.8. Overall, the nationwide homicide rate in 1987 was 8.5.
   Homicides accounted for 42 percent of the deaths of black males
15-24 in 1987. It was the leading cause of death for the group.
   The homicide problem is getting worse faster for black
teen-agers, the CDC said. The 1988 homicide rate for black males
15-19 was 76.8, up 99 percent since 1984. The rate for black males
20-24 was 127.2, up 53 percent from 1984.
   Firearm homicides accounted for virtually all the 1984-87
explosion in killings of young black males - more than 95 percent,
the CDC said.
   And six areas with rates of greater than 100 - California,
Florida, Michigan, Missouri, New York and the District of Columbia
- accounted for more than half the deaths of young black males in
1987, 51 percent.
   Those six areas have 29 percent of the nation's black male
population 15-24, the CDC said.
   In its weekly report, the CDC called for more research into ways
to stop the killings.
   ``Research and evaluation efforts have not demonstrated
effective programmatic approaches to prevent homicide,'' it said.

   Statistics don't lie, but neither do they tell the whole truth.
Behind the soaring numbers of homicides in some of America's
largest cities lie the bodies and broken dreams of real people,
real families and real neighborhoods. Here is a sampling:
   ---
   Rayvon Jamison was trying to learn how to walk when he died in
his family's New York City apartment in July. Rayvon, who was 9
months old, was one of four New York children who were caught in
the line of gunfire in a week's time.
   Rayvon was in a walker when he was struck in the shoulder by two
of seven shots fired into the apartment, police said at the time.
Nine adults, including his mother, were home at the time.
   Three young men were arrested and charged with murder in the
case. Police said they had been involved in an argument with
Rayvon's uncle and some other neighborhood men.
   Mayor David Dinkins issued an anguished plea for federal gun
control after Rayvon's death.
   ``Our children are dying. These young people, these babies, had
the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, but their
rights have been blown away. And for what?'' he said.
   ---
   On Monday, 10-year-old Willie Lawrence became the year's 60th
homicide victim in Bridgeport, Conn. He was shot in the head in the
inner-city apartment building where he lived.
   His cousin, Ramon Pagan, 18, said he believed he was the
gunman's target and that Lawrence was an innocent bystander.
   ---
   Kimberly Rae Harbour was 26 years old, a crack user and
sometimes prostitute. For that reason, some people in Boston say,
police didn't make a big deal out of her death on Halloween night.
   It was, however, a horrifying death - one that has since
captured far more attention than Harbour ever received in her life.
According to police, Harbour was chased into a park in the city's
Dorchester section by a group of teen-agers who proceeded to rape
her, bludgeon her and stab her more than 100 times.
   She also was robbed, police said, of $1.
   Eight youths have been charged in her death.
   ---
   Police called it a case of ``utterly senseless violence.'' Were
it not for the victim's last name, Bias, the shooting on Nov. 20 in
a shopping center outside Washington, D.C., probably would have
been quickly forgotten.
   Police in Maryland's Prince George's County said 20-year-old
James Stanley Bias III, also known as Jay, was shot in the parking
lot of the Prince George's Plaza Shopping Center in Hyattsville
following an argument in a jewelry store a few minutes before.
   Jerry Samuel Tyler, 24, of Temple Hills, was charged with
first-degree murder in the case.
   Bias was pronounced dead of two gunshot wounds to the back at
Leland Memorial Hospital in Riverdale, the same hospital where his
brother Len Bias was pronounced dead in June 1986.
   Len Bias, whose death shocked the sports world, died of a
cocaine induced heart attack just two days after his first-round
selection by the Boston Celtics in the National Basketball
Association draft.

   The following are selected portions of transcripts
of CNN tapes of Manuel Noriega's prison telephone conversations
prepared by a federal court and ordered released Thursday.
   Many of the conversations appear to use code words.
   The first segment comes from a conversation between Noriega and
his defense attorneys' office that sparked the judge's order to CNN
to cease telecasting the tapes. It involves Noriega speaking to
lead attorney Frank Rubino's legal secretary Cristina Machin.
   
   Noriega: ``There is a name I just saw in the newspaper, a person
named Alfredo Sanchez.''
   Machin: ``A...Alfredo''
   N: ``Sanchez.''
   M: ``Sanchez''
   N: ``And Felipe Camargo.''
   (he repeats, she checks with Rubino investigator Jim Hawkins)
   M: ``I have Jimmy here ... he says they were both arrested.''
   N: ``Uh huh.''
   M: ``And it is anticipated they will fully testify.''
   N: ``uh huh.''
   Hawkins: (Unintelligible.)
   M: ``This is only the newspaper.''
   N: ``Uh-huh.''
   M: ``We don't known anything definite yet, from the
government.''
   N: ``O.K., but you do have the article from the paper, right?''
   M: ``Yes, he suggests you run these names through your mind.''
   (Noriega says he has known Camargo as an officer, but not
Sanchez.)
   N: ``It's the last part, ah ah ... it's the, the last part, the
article is interesting because, well, it's showing their strategy,
it says that they are trying to offer them deals, right, so they
will testify against me.''
   
   In the following excerpt, Noriega appears to discuss frozen
funds with his mistress Vicki Amado's mother, Norma Amado. She asks
if ``the man'' has arrived and Noriega says no.
   Amado: ``No, I ended up without lunch because ...''
   Noriega: ``Yes, yes yes.''
   A: ``Too cold is also a hassle.''
   N: ``Ah, uh-huh, the weather there is bad?''
   A: ``Yes, yes, yes, uh?''
   (She says her ``namesake is going farther.'')
   A: ``Because there, well, it's not frozen there.''
   N: ``Uh-huh...''
   A: ``Since we are all frozen here and over there it wouldn't be
a problem.''
   (They continue)
   A: ``It occurred to me...''
   N: ``Yes.''
   A: ``That at a given moment there we have''
   N: ``Yes.''
   A: ``A good towel.''
   N: ``Ah, perfect.''
   A: ``And the important thing is that it shouldn't be a hand
(towel.)''
   N: ``Yes.''
   
   The following excerpt involves a conversation betwen Noriega
and his daughter, Sandra.
   Noriega: ``Because I was thinking, you know, that, well, that
changing the thing, see, if he leaves on Sunday, well, since the
food guy will be in Panama on Sunday...''
   Sandra: ``Uh-huh.''
   N: ``That he gives it to him and he brings it to Santo Domingo
to your mother.''
   (They discuss when he would arrive)
   S: ``The one with the food.''
   N: ``The one with the food goes there Sunday.''
   
   The next excerpt involves Noriega and an unidentified man,
possibly a lawyer who belongs to a pro-Noriega political party.
   Unknown man: ``If it is going to be this way, have someone do it
who is, is one of ours.''
   Noriega: ``Yes, there will be a hell of a headline, they well,
they will, (expletive), there will be a hell of a mess.''
   U: ``No.''
   N: ``And besides, they have a lot of information.''
   (They continue)
   N: ``And this, that is the first time, that the (expletive) will
be spelled out, without fear.''
   (Later, they talk about politics.)
   U: ``We must continue our path based on history.''
   N: ``And that is what we must explain to the people, that
before, that, that one must unite, that there are people with
ambition that are now going to take over the party, uh, because one
must also think of those who are still in the jails, those who have
died, the, the family, those that have been fired, those out
canvassing and looking for sponsors for the party and the people
who are suffering.''
   U: ``Maybe that is the point we must strive for, and keep
ourselves now, uh, in terms of future elections.''
   N: ``Yeah.''

<HEAD>Author Says Oil Was `Linchpin' of Japanese War Strategy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The attack on Pearl Harbor 49 years ago today
was linked more closely than commonly believed to Japan's thirst
for secure oil supplies, according to a new book that draws
haunting parallels to the Persian Gulf crisis.
   In ``The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power''
published this week, author Daniel Yergin called oil the
``linchpin'' of Japan's strategy for Asian conquest and the trigger
for its stunning attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941.
   The assault on the U.S. Pacific Fleet killed 2,335 American
servicemen and 68 civilians.
   Yergin's book, which was seven years in the making, cites the
Pacific campaign as one of many examples from the 20th century of
oil's crucial and painful role in global and regional conflict. It
draws parallels to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, calling it a
high-stakes gamble by a militaristic ruler bent on capturing new
oil wealth in order to widen his regional domination.
   Saddam Hussein, like Japan's leaders five decades earlier,
coveted oil and gave in to ``the inevitable and irresistible
temptation to grasp for its rewards,'' Yergin writes.
   Historians for years have drawn a connection between oil and
Japan's Indochina campaigns. Yergin, however, says oil not only
played a central role in the broader Japanese war strategy but also
was the driving force behind Operation Hawaii, as the Japanese
military called the Pearl Harbor plan.
   Yergin, an international oil specialist and president of the
consulting firm Cambridge Energy Research Associates, argues that
the militaristic Japanese leaders saw oil - in particular, Japan's
lack of indigenous supplies - as a vulnerability that could spoil
their imperialistic ambitions in Asia.
   ``They went to war over oil,'' Yergin said in an interview.
   So worried was Adm. Isoroku Yamamoto, commander-in-chief of
Japan's Combined Fleets, about insecure oil supplies to power his
ships that he even sponsored experiments by a ``scientist'' who
claimed he could change water to oil, Yergin writes. Japan also
considered sinking large sums into a crash program to produce
synthetic fuel from coal, although this never yielded results.
   Yergin concludes that Japan's main focus in the Asia campaigns
was to secure access to the oil fields of Borneo and the Dutch East
Indies, now Indonesia. At the time, Japan got 80 percent of its oil
from the United States, and it feared the consequences of a
possible American cutoff of supplies.
   In July 1941, President Roosevelt did sever the oil lifeline, a
move that Yergin says hardened the Japanese leadership's resolve to
strike at the U.S. Pacific Fleet, which Tokyo believed was the only
serious threat to its success in Asia.
   ``The operation against Pearl Harbor was meant to protect the
flank - to safeguard the Japanese invasion of the Indies and the
rest of Southeast Asia by incapacitating the American fleet and,
thereafter, to protect the sea lanes, particularly the tanker
routes from Sumatra and Borneo to the home islands,'' Yergin
writes.
   Strangely, considering the important role that oil played in
Japan's decision to attack Pearl Harbor, the Japanese navy failed
to understand the importance of the oil supplies on the Hawaiian
island of Oahu, Yergin says. They did not strike at the more than 4
million barrels of oil stored on the island for the U.S. ships.
   ``If the Japanese planes had knocked out the Pacific Fleet's
fuel reserves and the tanks in which they were stored at Pearl
Harbor, they would have immobilized every ship of the American
Pacific Fleet, and not just those they actually destroyed,'' he
writes.

   Worried about how to send fragile gifts? Take
some tips from curators of The Corning Museum of Glass, who just
shipped more than 120 priceless treasures to Washington without a
chip or crack.
   ``We do it very, very carefully,'' said museum official David
Whitehouse.
   ``The secret is to pack an object so it is held gently but
firmly into place, with enough packing materials around it and a
sturdy container to resist the bumps and knocks,'' he said.
   Whitehouse supervised the installation of a new exhibition
titled ``The Art of Glass: Masterpieces from The Corning Museum,''
which will be on display at the National Gallery of Art from Sunday
through March 17.
   The delicate objects that traveled from Corning, N.Y., to
Washington span 35 centuries of the glassmaker's art, from a
perfume bottle made by Egyptian artisans in about 1400 B.C. to
brilliantly colored glass filament sculptures fashioned by a Dutch
artist in 1988.
   Among the most famous pieces in the show are the ``Disch
Kantharos,'' a 4th Century Roman goblet contained in a clear glass
cage, and a rare ``Hedwig beaker'' from the 12th century that was
discovered in Cologne, Germany.
   From one of these carved glass tumblers, only 14 of which are
known to survive, the patron saint of Silesia supposedly drank
water that turned into wine.
   To pack a treasure like these, Whitehouse said, the Corning
museum began with a stout cardboard box.
   ``We would fill the box with two foam bricks, cut to fit inside
the box exactly when placed one on top of the other. Then we would
carve out of the two bricks a nest as close to the shape of the
object as we can make it, and a tad bigger,'' he said.
   ``We would wrap the object in acid-free tissue paper and set it
into the bottom half of the nest. Then we'd fit the other brick on
top, so the object is gently but firmly trapped inside its own foam
shock absorber.
   ``Then we put the box inside a custom-built wooden crate about a
half-inch thick. The crate will contain usually eight cardboard
boxes with little thin foam sheets to separate them. Then we screw
the lid down on the crate.
   ``What you've got is a stout crate of eight boxes instead of a
carton of eggs,'' he said.
   For the 280-mile trip to Washington, the boxed glass objects
traveled in two customized commercial trucks built with an air
suspension and long wheel base to minimize the shocks of hitting an
occasional pothole.
   The trucks were climate-controlled to protect the glass from the
damaging effects of sudden changes in temperature and humidity. A
half-dozen Corning museum employees packed the objects, traveled
with the shipment and unpacked and mounted them at the National
Gallery.
   Several objects in the show are so fragile that they were
carried personally to Washington by the Corning curators, nestled
safely under their car or plane seats.
   Whitehouse said one was an ``incredibly thin'' pitcher made in
Persia in 1000 A.D. that previously had been ``broken into a
million pieces'' and painstakingly glued back together.
   ``Another secret is never to let these objects get out of your
sight,'' Whitehouse said. ``There is absolutely nothing you can do
to stop a cowboy driving a forklift except to tell him to back
off.''

   To Brazilian industrialists, an
Acre-Peru Road is the path to a brighter future. To ecologists
worried about the Amazon, it is the devil's own highway.
   Such a road would fulfill a centuries-old vision of a land route
across northern South America, but it probably won't be built soon
because the continent has a huge foreign debt and concern for the
environment is growing.
   Mere mention of the Acre-Peru Road causes headlines in Latin
America, mobilizes environmentalists in Europe and the United
States, and starts up the diplomatic teletypes.
   Mario Amato, one of Brazil's most influential industrialists,
was the latest catalyst.
   ``Brazil must have an outlet to the Pacific,'' said Amato, who
is acting president of the National Confederation of Industry and
organized a seminar to promote the highway. He said it would be a
direct export route for Brazilian forest products to the U.S. west
coast and Japan, bypassing the Panama Canal.
   ``Opposition to this road is mostly political demagoguery,'' he
said in an interview, and environmentalists ``have a morbid
aversion to progress. Real ecological degradation is that which
destroys human dignity, through misery and isolation.''
   Amato said ecological problems ``can be worked out while the
highway is being built.''
   His campaign has produced a flood of newspaper articles, with
maps and dotted lines showing how to link Brazil's far-western
Amazon region, as yet undestroyed, with the Pacific.
   There are two possible routes for the road, both starting at Rio
Branco, the capital of Acre, Brazil's westernmost state.
   One would run northwest and hook up with the Peruvian highway
system about 700 miles away in Pucallpa, on the eastern slopes of
the Andes. The other, about 300 miles long, would go southwest, cut
through part of northern Bolivia and meet the Peruvian road system
at Puerto Maldonado, a jungle outpost.
   Jungle tracks and muddy ruts already exist along sections of
both routes, but building the highway would involve massive
clearing of forest and the uprooting of rubber-tree tappers, Brazil
nut harvesters and native Indians.
   On the Peruvian side, the road would run through country
controlled by cocaine gangs and the Maoist guerrilla group Shining
Path, both deadly to intruders.
   The main opposition in Brazil comes from President Fernando
Collor de Mello and his internationally known environment
secretary, Jose Lutzenberger.
   ``I'm against the highway for ecological reasons,'' Lutzenberger
said in an interview. ``The president guaranteed it will not be
built.''
   Brazil plans to host a huge U.N. world environment conference in
1992 and has been working to change its image from destroyer of the
Amazon jungle to its protector.
   Peru's director of roads, Hector Rosales, said in an interview
in Lima: ``We are not in a condition to finance this road, but if
Brazil or somebody else offered us money to build it, we would
probably accept.''
   For environmentalists, the most convincing argument against a
highway west of Rio Branco is the one called BR-364 that was opened
east and south of there in the 1980s.
   Hundreds of thousands of homesteaders, prospectors and ranchers
followed the road into Acre's neighboring state, Rondonia, and in a
few short years chopped down or burned 20 percent of the virgin
rain forest. Rondonia is the size of Oregon.
   When the Inter-American Development Bank proposed to finance the
paving of BR-364, such groups as the National Wildlife Federation,
Sierra Club and Environmental Defense Fund mobilized a global
campaign against it.
   At one point, pro-environment U.S. senators threatened to block
all U.S. financing for the Inter-American Development Bank because
of BR-364. Brazil agreed to impose strict protections for the
jungle and Indian tribes.
   When the Acre-Peru proposal emerged at the end of the decade,
President Bush entered the picture, at least in the view of the
Brazilian news media.
   They were convinced Bush personally opposed the highway and had
pressured Japan not to finance it. Brazilian environmentalists
applauded the U.S. leader and the pro-highway faction accused him
of meddling in Brazilian affairs.
   ``The president, while aware of the controversy, has never
voiced a position on the road,'' Stephen Hart, deputy White House
press secretary, said in Washington. He said the administration
would follow State Department guidelines on the Acre-Peru Road.
   A State Department official who works on Brazilian affairs said,
on condition of anonymity: ``We're not helping anybody who's
building a highway in which there is no environmental plan.''
   Japan also is cautious. Shintaro Sasaki, second in command at
the Japanese Embassy in Brasilia, said his government was ``unaware
of any plan to finance such a highway.''
   He agreed Brazilian exports to the East now must travel through
the Panama Canal or around Cape Horn, but said that made sense for
iron ore, the main export to Japan, because the mines are in
eastern Brazil.
   ``Therefore,'' he said, ``Japan has no interest in shortening
trade routes from Brazil by building a highway to the west coast of
South America.''
   Proponents are not giving up.
   ``What we're talking about is the need to physically link Acre
to the rest of the world,'' said Marco Antonio Mendes, the state's
environment secretary.

   The displays of sparkling jumpsuits, gold
records and shiny motorcycles at Elvis Presley's house are about to
get a bit flashier, managers of the estate say.
   Tom Parker, who directed Presley's career for 30 years, has sold
his personal collection of rock 'n' roll memorabilia to the
residence known as Graceland.
   The collection includes about 70,000 pounds of business
documents, photographs, clothes, newsreels and other items,
Graceland managers said Thursday.
   It also includes more gold records, acetate recordings of
Presley's early studio work and promotional tapes of Elvis messages
passed out to radio stations in the early days of the singer's
career.
   One acetate recording is of Presley's first appearance on the
``Louisiana Hayride'' radio show in 1954.
   Presley's famous gold lame suit will join his other outfits on
display at Graceland, as will the 1976 Cadillac he gave Parker as a
present.
   The gold suit will go on display in January during annual
festivities surrounding Presley's birthday.
   Jim Jaworowicz, Graceland's specialist for rock 'n' roll
artifacts, said the collection covers Parker's 65 years as a music
promoter and offers a clear paper trail on the business side of
creating a star.
   ``It's so well kept, it's like a time capsule from the `50s,''
Jaworowicz said.
   Parker, 81, who generally avoids reporters, said he had several
would-be buyers for the collection, including an eager Japanese
bidder who offered the top price.
   Parker, known as Col. Tom Parker or just ``the colonel,'' said
he wanted the collection at Graceland. He said he expects there to
be an ``Elvis and the Colonel'' museum at Graceland one day.
   ``Someday when I'm not around, it will always be `Elvis and the
Colonel,''' Parker said by telephone from his residence near
Nashville.
   Jack Soden, executive director of the Graceland Division of
Elvis Presley Enterprises Inc., would not reveal the purchase price
for the collection. Niether would Parker.
   Graceland, which draws more than 600,000 visitors annually,
already includes extensive displays of clothes, vehicles and
mementos that once belonged to Presley. The estate also has a
36,000-square-foot shopping center devoted primarily to Elvis
souvenirs.
   His body racked by drug abuse, Presley died at Graceland in
1977. He was 42.
   Parker said there was nothing he could do to keep Presley from
abusing drugs.
   ``He did it on his own. Elvis, you could not tell Elvis anything
what to do,'' he said. ``He made his own decisions and you could
not change them.''
   Parker said he was unaware of Presley's drug use when it began.
   ``I found out later that Elvis told the boys, `Don't tell the
colonel,'' Parker said.
   Parker, who has been involved in legal disputes with the Presley
estate over the years, said he was pleased for his name to become a
bigger part of the Elvis displays at Graceland.
   ``No one but myself and Elvis and his father knew how close we
were,'' Parker said.

   Decades before the sound bite became
the parlance of politics, Calvin Coolidge doffed his ``Silent Cal''
image and stepped up to the mike, delivering his annual Message to
Congress to a spellbound nation.
   Historians on Thursday remembered the anniversary of the
president's first broadcast, hailed by critics of the day who said
Coolidge's Yankee twang cut admirably across the crackle of early
radio.
   ``Apparently his high-pitched nasal whine really penetrated the
static,'' said Kelly Buckley, curator of the Coolidge collection at
the Forbes Library in Northampton, the western Massachusetts town
where Coolidge got his political start.
   The speech, delivered Dec. 6, 1923, on a hookup of seven radio
stations, sent neighbors flocking to the homes of those who owned
new radio sets, said Buckley, also a historian at the University of
Massachusetts.
   ``Out on the prairie, picking up these little signals on crystal
radio sets, it really must have given people a sense of connection
that they never had before,'' he said.
   The speech was a lengthy discourse on several topics including
foreign affairs, with Coolidge taking a wishy-washy stand on the
League of Nations, and endorsing continued restricted immigration.
   ``America must be kept American,'' Coolidge said in a broadcast
heard by stations as far away as Missouri and Texas, said Michael
Kittross, a professor at Emerson College in Boston.
   ``Coolidge was the master of the platitude,'' Buckley said.
``What he said was comforting and full of cracker barrel wisdom.''

<HEAD>Pentagon Says Saddam Put More Troops in Kuwait</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new buildup of Iraqi troops in and around
Kuwait is enabling Iraq to extend its line of multi-layered
defenses well to the west of the occupied emirate, the Pentagon
says.
   Bob Hall, a Pentagon spokesman, said Thursday that Iraq has
moved an additional 30,000 troops into Kuwait and southern Iraq,
raising the total to 480,000. That is more than four times the
number Iraq used in its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Hall also announced that 10,000 U.S. reinforcements had arrived
in the Persian Gulf area, raising the total American deployment to
more than 250,000.
   About 180,000 additional U.S. troops are scheduled to join
Operation Desert Shield over the next several weeks. On Thursday,
the Army said it ordered to active duty 1,521 National Guard and
Reserve members for Operation Desert Shield.
   The Army call-up raised to 118,834 the number of U.S. reservists
put on active duty in all services for Desert Shield since the
operation began in August.
   In announcing the further Iraqi buildup at a news briefing, Hall
said most of the extra Iraqi troops were shifted from the Iranian
border. Their redeployment has enabled Iraq to extend its line of
defense further west from Kuwait, he said.
   The apparent purpose of extending Iraqi defensive fortifications
to the west would be to block any flanking movement by American and
allied ground forces in the event of an offensive campaign to
dislodge Iraq from Kuwait.
   U.S. military officials have said they would look for ways of
avoiding a frontal assault on the Iraqi forces inside Kuwait, which
are aligned in an elaborate and deep defensive position surrounded
by land mines and anti-tank ditches.
   The Bush administration, in arguing against waiting indefinitely
for United Nations economic sanctions to compel Iraq to withdraw
from Kuwait, has argued in recent days that delay would give Iraq
more time to strengthen its defenses in and around Kuwait.
   It is unclear, however, whether the extended defensive line Iraq
reportedly is building west of Kuwait actually would make it harder
for a U.S. attack to succeed. One Army official, speaking
privately, said the stretching of its defenses would make Iraq's
supply lines more vulnerable to air attack.
   Hall said the addition of 30,000 Iraqi troops to the area seemed
to indicate that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein did not intend to
withdraw from Kuwait, even though Iraq announced Thursday that it
was preparing the release of all foreign hostages.
   A hostage release would not affect Pentagon plans for Desert
Shield troop deployments, Hall said.
   He declined to provide more information about the latest Iraqi
reinforcements, which apparently have been detected by U.S.
intelligence in recent days.
   In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Gen.
Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Monday
there were 450,000 Iraqi troops in and around Kuwait, along with
3,800 tanks. Hall said there now are 4,000 tanks.
   He also said the Iraqis have 2,500 armored personnel carriers
and infantry fighting vehicles in the Kuwait area of operations, an
increase of 300 from the total Powell reported to the Senate
committee. The number of Iraqi artillery pieces was reported by
Hall to have increased by 200, to 2,700.
   The Pentagon, citing security, won't provide figures on specific
U.S. weapons in the gulf area.
   The latest U.S. troops to arrive in the gulf apparently are the
lead elements of a huge reinforcement effort under way at U.S.
bases in Germany and the United States. About 430,000 American
troops are expected to be in the gulf area by late January.

   Americans in the nation's biggest cities killed each other in
record numbers this year, a rise in carnage police blame on guns,
drugs and a declining reverence for human life.
   Not all cities had increased killings, but the number of
homicides in the 20 largest cities in 1990 has surpassed the 1989
total by 3 percent, and the year is not yet over. Police in those
20 cities have recorded 7,698 homicides so far this year.
   New York City recorded its 2,000th violent death of the year
last weekend, when seven people were killed in one night. The city
had long since surpassed its old record of 1,905 homicides, set
just last year.
   Washington, D.C.'s, mark of 434 homicides fell late last month,
making it likely that the nation's capital, which has the highest
per-capita homicide rate, would remain the murder capital as well.
   Homicide records have been set in Dallas, Phoenix, San Antonio,
Memphis, Milwaukee, Boston and New Orleans, according to the latest
statistics compiled by police in those cities. New marks also were
set in Richmond, Va., in Providence, R.I., Bridgeport, Conn., and
Oakland and Fresno, Calif.
   In most big cities, police say young black men are causing - and
bearing the brunt of - the increase in violence.
   In 1990, young urbanites killed for drugs, for clothes, for
pittances of cash, for love, for hate and just for the hell of it.
They killed friends, relatives and innocent bystanders. They turned
poor neighborhoods into virtual prisons for law-abiding citizens.
   ``They just don't care,'' said Lt. Joe Hladky, acting commander
of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department homicide division.
``It's that disregard for the value of human life that makes you
wonder what direction we're going.''
   James A. Fox, co-director of the National Crime Analysis Program
at Northeastern University in Boston, has been tracking homicide
statistics dating back to 1976, and believes the current upsurge in
homicide can be traced to a ``baby boomerang'' - the coming of age
of the children of baby boomers.
   The last big peak in homicides occurred in the early 1970s, when
baby boomers reached prime murder age - late teens and early to
mid-20s. Now, Fox said, their children are beginning to reach that
age.
   These young people, Fox said, ``have drugs and weapons and a
much more casual attitude about human life than their parents a
generation ago.''
   ``This year will pale in comparison to years to come. It's going
to get a lot worse,'' he said. ``It's often said that Americans
have a love affair with violence, but in reality it's more like a
marriage. And if we don't watch out in the next few years, it may
be a marriage in which death does us part.''
   Ask Clifton Waters, a 36-year-old Milwaukee man. A 21-year-old
man was shot to death while sitting in a car in front of Waters'
home in October. With 156 homicides so far this year, Milwaukee has
far exceeded its previous high of 116, set in 1989.
   ``When I was young, you could play football in the street,''
Waters said. ``If you bumped into someone's car, you said, `Excuse
me.' Now, if you touch someone's car, you get killed.''

   The 22-year-old actor was hospitalized last week and released
Thursday, said his spokesman, Michael Gerety, who declined to

   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - M.C. Hammer showed up in person at a
high school, surprising about 1,000 students who had just finished
watching an anti-drug video featuring the hot rapper.
   ``I just want to tell everybody here today to do all they can to
not be caught up in a substance problem or with dealing drugs,''
said Hammer, known for his hit album ``Please Hammer Don't Hurt
`Em.''
   Hammer answered questions Wednesday from McClatchy High School
students after the premiere of the video featuring his hit, ``U
Can't Touch This.''
   He was in town for a concert Wednesday night, but the students
did not expect to see him at school.

   PHILADELPHIA (AP) - Mayor W. Wilson Goode, who this week imposed
a gag order on his administration, will write a newspaper column
starting today.
   The Philadelphia Tribune, the nation's oldest continuously
published black newspaper, will publish the column biweekly on its
editorial page, editor Paul A. Bennett said. Goode will not be paid
for the column.
   Goode, Philadelphia's first black mayor, addresses the city's
fiscal crisis in today's column. The city may not meet its payroll
this month.
   The mayor on Wednesday ordered city officials not to talk to
reporters about Philadelphia's fiscal crisis ``without direct
clearance to do so from me personally.''

who lined up in 20-degree weather for a chance to be one of 100
extras in the filme.
   Some footage for the romantic comedy ``Only the Lonely'' was
shot Thursday night, with more scheduled for tonight.
   ``It's a big scene of holiday travelers at a train station with
John Candy and Ally Sheedy on the train,'' said Mark Ridge, a
casting director.
   The movie also features Jim Belushi, Maureen O'Hara and Kevin

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Soviet spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov, known
for his quick wit and understanding of the United States, is the
first foreigner to win a government group's ``communicator of the
year'' award.
   Gerasimov, 60, formerly chief spokesman for the Soviet Foreign
Ministry, lost much of his visibility earlier this year when
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev named his own presidential
spokesman.
   The National Association of Government Communicators, whose
members include public affairs employees of federal, state and
local governments, will present its annual award today.
   Gerasimov rose to prominence as the Kremlin emerged from the
Cold War in the 1980s. His frequent press briefings, fluent English
and acerbic wit made him a frequently cited source in news stories
about the Soviet Union.

   POMPANO BEACH, Fla. (AP) - From the totally bald Telly Savalas

   Company founder Jacqueline Sabal said she's also approached
Frank Sinatra, James Caan, Corbin Bernsen, Julio Iglesias, Jackie
Mason and George Carlin without success.
   ``I'm having a heck of time getting these movie stars to admit
they're losing their hair,'' said Sabal, who invented an herbal
scalp cleanser called Foli-Kleen 2000, which she claims helps slow
hair loss.
   ``Everyone on that list there, I've either spoken to them or to
their agents,'' Sabal said. ``They laugh at us.''

<HEAD>Economic Slide May Push Jobless Rate to 6 Percent, Analysts Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The nation's economic slide, which has pushed
the American unemployment rate up dramatically in recent months,
threatens to send the jobless rate to 6 percent or higher by the
end of the year, analysts say.
   ``As the outlook becomes more dire ... the entire pipeline (of
jobs) will slow,'' said Elliott Platt, an economist with Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp.
   Private analysts will get their first comprehensive look at the
nation's economic activity for November with today's release of the
Labor Department's unemployment report.
   In advance of the report, many predicted the jobless rate shot
up to 5.9 percent in November, an increase of 0.2 percentage points
from the October rate of 5.7 percent.
   That would be the highest jobless rate since October 1987, when
it was 6 percent.
   Analysts also expected the Labor Department's report to show
that the nation's industries lost between 45,000 and 160,000 jobs
in November. Last year, the nation's economy was producing nearly
200,000 new jobs a month.
   Higher unemployment and widespread job losses in November would
back up many analysts' belief that the nation is in a recession,
even though government data backing that up or refuting it won't be
out until January.
   ``The recession deepened in November, the lull continued - that
would be the basic message,'' said Robert Dederick, chief economist
at the Northern Trust Co. of Chicago.
   If American businesses posted big job declines in November as
predicted, Platt said, it won't be a surprise because many
companies have announced large-scale layoffs in recent weeks.
   `It's not just a matter of people not adding on workers; it's
now a matter of laying them off,'' Platt said.
   Many analysts believe the jobless rate will be at least 6
percent by the end of the year.
   ``The trend is toward 6 percent. If it isn't there by the end of
the year, it will be only because the labor force is growing more
slowly than we think,'' Dederick said.
   Before July, the jobless rate had held steady for months at 5.3
percent or within a tenth of a percentage point of that level.
   In July, the jobless rate shot up from 5.2 percent to 5.5
percent, then rose again in August and September before holding
steady at 5.7 percent in October.
   The nation's manufacturing sector, which has been in a slump for
months, probably continued that slide in November, analysts said.
But now the slump is also affecting the services sector as well,
they said.
   The only industry that has been spared in recent months and
continued to boom is health care, which has been adding about
50,000 jobs a month.

   For professional petroleum traders, prices for
unleaded gasoline have tumbled to the level they stood at just
before Iraq invaded Kuwait, but for motorists, prices at the pump
are still near all-time highs.
   If past pricing trends hold true, ordinary consumers will find
that the law of gravity doesn't necessarily apply in the energy
business. One consumer activist group said Thursday that for the
next few weeks at least, customers of the friendly neighborhood
filling station likely will get gouged.
   ``When prices go up, they raise prices immediately,'' said Edwin
S. Rothschild of Citizen Action in Washington. ``When prices in
these futures and spot markets go down, it takes a long time for
the savings to be passed on. That's the way the companies take
advantage of changing market conditions.''
   The oil industry, which maintains that prices are set by supply
and demand, says pricing is not such a simple thing.
   The American Petroleum Institute has acknowledged there are
times when savings have not been passed along promptly to
consumers, but it has also pointed out trends in which crude oil
prices were rising at the same time the pump price of gasoline was
falling.
   ``If the price of crude oil goes down and stays down, then the
price of gasoline will undoubtably follow,'' API spokesman Gus Ensz
said. ``It's difficult to analyze each and every situation, because
thousands of people are running service stations, and the people
who run those service stations make the ultimate decision.''
   The industry has asserted that all recent investigations into
petroleum pricing cleared oil companies of gouging.
   But Rothschild said a comparison of recent prices shows that
consumers are paying too much.
   ``From the beginning of November to December, there's been a
20-cent-a-gallon drop in the spot price of gasoline, and yet
there's been barely any decrease at all in the (pump) price of
gasoline,'' Rothschild said. ``My suspicion is, if anything, we
should now be much more concerned about oil companies ripping
consumers off.''
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the leading market for
petroleum contracts, wholesale gasoline prices fell below 65 cents
Thursday, to the approximate level they were at right before Iraq
invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and caused a spike in the price of oil.
   But the latest nationwide survey by the American Automobile
Association found the average price of a gallon of self-serve
regular unleaded to be $1.387. That's 31.2 cents higher than the
price on Aug. 1, and just .1 cent less than AAA's highest recorded
price of $1.388, just before the Easter holiday in 1981, the AAA
said when the survey was released Tuesday.
   Gasoline was up 2.1 cents for the week, and AAA pointed out that
it probably would have fallen a few cents for the week had it not
been for the imposition of an additional 5.1-cent federal tax,
which took effect Saturday.
   Rothschild agreed that the tax had an impact and that otherwise
pump prices could be coming down, although he insisted any decrease
will take too long.

   Britain's official war artist, with sketchbook at
the ready, has been anxiously waiting for three months to start
drawing the troops in the Persian Gulf.
   The Imperial War Museum has commissioned him and is eager to get
him there. But a Ministry of Defense spokesman said Wednesday:
``There is no delay - we haven't got a war yet.''
   John Keane, still waiting in his north London studio, says the
commission is ``an extraordinary opportunity and I've been keyed up
to be going.''
   ``The fact of my going doesn't depend on there being a war and I
sincerely hope there won't be one,'' said Keane, who has worked in
zones of conflict in Northern Ireland and Nicaragua.
   ``The reason for my going is to portray the British troops
committed to the area; war would be an extra dimension.''
   The museum set aside almost $20,000 in August for the Keane
commission - a quarter before he goes and the balance on completion
of his studio paintings from on-the-spot sketches and photographs.
   ``I haven't had a penny yet so I have been getting on with other
work,'' said Keane, 36, a respected artist who receives up to about
$30,000 for an oil painting.
   The Imperial War Museum in south London has 12,000 works
recording battles and the home front in both world wars, as well as
lesser campaigns like the 1982 conflict to regain the Falkland
Islands.
   ``We want John to go to the gulf now, as when serious fighting
takes place he can't do much. He can't wander about with his
sketchbook and camera if shells are falling,'' said Angela Weight,
curator of the museum's art collection.
   The defense spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the ministry won't sanction an official war artist ``when there is
no war at this time.''
   ``There has to be a conflict for him to be employed. If
something happens he could expect to go,'' the spokesman said.

   Here are some of the fast-moving diplomatic developments in the
gulf crisis that preceded Thursday's annoucement by Iraq on freeing
foreign hostages.
   ---
   Nov. 29 - The U.N. Security Council authorizes the use of force
to push Iraq out of Kuwait unless Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
withdraws by Jan. 15.
   ---
   Nov. 29 - Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze says the Soviet
Union ``will not hesitate to use force'' to protect Soviet citizens
in Iraq.
   ---
   Nov. 30 - President Bush invites Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq
Aziz to Washington the week of Dec. 10 and says he will dispatch
Secretary of State James A. Baker III to Baghdad before Jan. 15.
   ---
   Dec. 2 - Iraq warns the Soviet Union not to send troops to the
gulf, and tells Bush not to use proposed talks ``as a pretext with
the American people to justify his aggression against Iraq.''
   ---
   Dec. 4 - Iraq says it will allow almost 3,300 Soviets stranded
in Iraq to leave, but demands that Moscow pay compensation for
canceling their work contracts.

international Mideast peace conference.
   ---
   Dec. 5 - The U.S. State Department announces that Iraq has

<HEAD>Texas Congressman Says FBI Out to Get Him</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Rep. Albert Bustamante, reportedly under
investigation by the FBI in Texas, says agents have threatened
people with jail time if they refused to provide damaging
information about him.
   The San Antonio (Texas) Light reported Thursday that the FBI had
confirmed it was investigating Bustamante and his longtime friend,
Eddie Garcia, as part of a probe into an Indian bingo parlor deal.
   But chief FBI spokesman Thomas F. Jones refused to confirm or
deny that the men were being investigated.
   ``We are not going to comment on a pending investigation,''
Jones said.
   The newspaper reported that a source said the FBI was
investigating whether Bustamante or Garcia spent or received money
illegally in pursuing a bingo parlor agreement with the Kickapoo
Indians in Eagle Pass.
   ``They've been looking but they can't find anything; it's
garbage,'' said Bustamante, a Democrat.
   ``They've tried to persuade people to say things against me,
even to the point of threatening them that they'll face jail
time,'' Bustamante said.
   Bustamante said the investigation is the latest twist in a
long-running effort by the FBI to ``get'' some ``Hispanic scalps,''
particularly a Hispanic politician.
   Bustamante said that he wrote a letter introducing Garcia to
leaders of the Kickapoo tribe, whose reservation is in his
district. Garcia was lobbying them for a bingo contract.
   An unidentified source told the newspaper that FBI agents are
checking whether Garcia offered any inducements to the tribe -
including bribes - to cement the bingo deal.
   Garcia, who told the San Antonio Express-News earlier this week
that the case is before a federal grand jury, denies any
impropriety.
   Garcia said the investigation was ``strictly political.''

<TEXT>
   Saddam Hussein's decision to free all
foreign hostages appears to be an Iraqi gamble to avert war. It
also seems aimed at bolstering opposition in the United States to a
Persian Gulf conflict.
   In asking Iraq's National Assembly to free the hostages, Saddam
cited ``positive changes'' in the Persian Gulf crisis, including
sentiment in the U.S. Congress for a non-military solution.
   He also said ``any measure that could delay war at the time was
appropriate. ...''
   There are strong indications that Saddam failed to get what he
wanted from the hostages and that they had become a burden,
analysts said Thursday.
   ``Now, I think, he is divesting himself of the burden, and also
taking away the biggest reason, in the minds of public opinion, for
confronting him,'' said Philip Robins, an analyst with the Royal
Institute of International Studies in London.
   From the beginning, the hostages have been a public relations
nightmare for Saddam. The world reacted to the detention of
thousands of foreigners at least as harshly as it did to the
invasion of Kuwait itself.
   The way they were labeled ``guests of Iraq'' was ridiculed in
the West. So was Saddam's attempt to portray a kindly image by
appearing on television ruffling the hair of a frightened looking
child.
   In responding to Saddam's announcement Thursday, President Bush
mentioned the world's reaction:
   ``No single hostage should have been taken in the first place,
and I hope ... Saddam understands that his hostage policy has
incurred the hostility of the whole world.''
   For weeks, Saddam had said he would release everyone in exchange
for guarantees against an attack - which he never received.
   On Nov. 18, he said he would free all the hostages by March 25.
The only condition then was if ``nothing mars the atmosphere of
peace.''
   But that step was followed by U.N. Security Council's approval
of the use of force to drive Iraq out of Kuwait if Saddam does not
withdraw by Jan. 15.
   ``I think it increasingly becomes clear that the hostages have
been a problem for him,'' Robins said. ``They have not been able to
deliver to him what he wanted, which was immunity from attack, or
breaking up the international consensus against him.
   ``I think having failed to achieve that, the hostages have
become a burden because they depict him as a tyrant in the West,''
he said.
   Shahram Chubin of the Graduate Institute for International
Studies in Geneva said there seemed to be two main reasons for
Saddam's latest move: ``U.S. domestic division on the use of force,
weakening the credibility of the Jan. 15 deadline, and that the
sanctions are working.''
   Allowing more time for the sanctions to work was one of the
strongest themes from experts testifying in hearings before the
U.S. Senate's Armed Services Committee.
   Right after sanctions were imposed, Bush himself voiced
confidence they would succeed in forcing Saddam to withdraw from
Kuwait. But his administration has shifted to the opposite view in
recent weeks.
   The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Colin Powell,
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Secretary of State James A. Baker
III have left no doubt that administration policy would not depend
on ecomomic sanctions to force Saddam to leave Kuwait.
   ``As we wait, he will continue manipulating hostages, attempting
to break the coalition,'' Baker said.
   On Tuesday, Democrats in the House of Representatives voted
177-37 for a non-binding resolution that said Bush should not order
and attack without prior approval from Congress.
   ``I think the Iraqis will try to use this to try to find an
accommodation, some sort of agreement with the United States,''
Robins said.
   Saddam's releasing the hostages now puts the United States in
the position of having to negotiate seriously when Foreign Minister
Tariq Aziz goes to Washington and Baker goes to Baghdad later this
month, analysts said.
   ``The psychological pressure (on Saddam) has been kept up both
ways,'' said Don Kerr, a military analyst at the Institute for
Strategic Studies in London.
   First came the U.S. approach for talks, ``followed up by Gen.
Powell's indications and indications from Mr. Baker that the United
States was prepared to go to war and was prepared to make it
sudden, bloody and successful,'' Kerr said.
   ``I think that this is probably a response by Saddam in the same
vein, to throw off balance, to obfuscate,'' Kerr said.

   Following are excerpts of Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein's letter to his National Assembly on the release of
foreign hostages as reported by the official Iraqi News Agency. The
excerpts were translated from the Arabic by The Associated Press:
   ---
   In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate,
   Mr. National Assembly speaker, members. Peace be upon you.
   In difficult conditions, the strength of the believers'
commitment is put to the test. Their action in the service of
principles is also put to the test. Iraqis in general, and you
amongst them, have proved that on very dark nights, the spark of
faith glows much brighter than on ordinary nights. Adherence to the
supreme principles governing the relation between man and the
creator and his duty toward him, as well as the relation between
the Iraqis and other nations, becomes stronger in the more
difficult circumstances...
   On the basis of these principles and what we desire - that the
influence of the believers expand, and that the knowledge of
mankind in general expand with the believers' principles and the
truth of their mission - we deem it necessary that our National
Assembly convene to take a final and irrevocable stand toward a
humanitarian issue which you and the rest of the world are aware
of...
   National Assembly members, the thing that worries the faithful
mujahid, the honorable struggler, and the brave fighter ... most is
when the trenches in the battle arena get mixed and when some
people, who do not want to fight and who are not among the
evildoers, get trapped in the space between the two trenches. This
worry becomes deep grief when that kind of people are harmed
because of the level and type of the conflict.
   Some people with no confrontational or evil intentions were
caught in the middle.
   Some of the foreigners who have been prevented from travel fall
under that category in the battle between right, led by Iraq's
great people and valiant armed forces, and evil, whose failing mass
is led by Bush, the enemy of God.
   As you and my brothers in the leadership know, I recognize that,
despite what they had to put up with, denying those people the
freedom to travel has rendered a great service to the cause of
peace. And, because God has taught us that forbidden things should
never be resorted to except in very urgent cases and without any
excesses, we must not keep these emergency measures, especially
this measure, any longer...
   For instance, our valiant Iraqi forces had not completed their
mobilization in Kuwait to confront a potential military aggression.
   Any measure that could delay war at the time was appropriate,
although it may have not been correct from the humanitarian
standpoint, so that we use the opportunity to complete preparations
for that possibility.
   But now our forces, with the blessing and care of the Almighty,
are fully prepared to defend our values and principles against the
traitors and infidels and also in defense of the great national,
regional and humanitarian gains.
   Gentlemen: good people, men and women of different nationalities
and political trends have come to Iraq. Dear brothers from Jordan,
Yemen, Palestine, Sudan and the Arab Maghreb have also consulted
with us on this issue, as on others. We had suggested a different
timing to coincide with Christmas and New Year, the two holy
occasions which are of special importance to Christians all over
the world, especially in the West.
   However, the appeal by some Arab brothers, the decision of the
Democratic majority in the U.S. Senate, and the European
Parliament's invitation to our foreign minister for dialogue; all
these have encouraged us to respond to these positive changes -
changes that will have a major impact on world public opinion in
general, and U.S. public opinion in particular, in restraining the
evil ones who are seeking and pushing for war as the option they
have chosen out of their evil tendencies and premeditated
intentions to do harm.
   In view of all this, we have found that the reasons for which
the foreigners were prevented from travel have diminished and have
been replaced by something more powerful - a change in the American
public opinion which will impose restrictions on the decisions and
intentions of the evil ones, led by Bush, the enemy of God.
   Therefore, I urge you to take a just decision to end the travel
ban imposed on foreigners and to restore to all of them the freedom
to travel, apologizing to those who may have been harmed, and
seeking forgiveness from God, the Almighty.
   Brothers, I ask you, and through you I ask the Iraqi people to
maintain your alertness and vigil. Iraqi armed forces should
maintain the highest degree of alert and vigilance because the
forces of aggression remain on our sacred soil in Saudi Arabia,
fanning the flames of fire.
   Bush's call for dialogue is still concealing war intentions and
we must be aware not to fall into such traps...
   God is great, cursed be the infidels and traitors, who gave the
oppressors and infidels the opportunity to invade the holy
land...''

   Galina is tired of Russian men who expect her to
do all the cooking and shopping, plus work a full-time job. She has
an idea that with an American man, ``things might be a bit more
equal.''
   So she sent three photographs and an application to Nakhodka, or
Godsend, the first ``mail-order bride'' service matching Soviet
women with North American men.
   ``Of course, if I met a very sweet American man, I would be
willing to cook and clean for him, too,'' Galina, 36, explained in
an interview. ``But at least I would be living in America.''
   The lure of love in a land of prosperity has hooked many Soviet
women this year. More than 1,500 have paid 50 rubles (about 880)
apiece to join Godsend since it was founded eight months ago.
   The company is part of a new Soviet bride industry that includes
an Italian marriage service, an international video introduction
firm and half-a-dozen magazines packed with personal ads.
   Behind the industry are two recent phenomena: President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's political reforms, which have made it easier to
meet, marry and move abroad with foreigners; and the worsening
Soviet economy, which has cut into the quality of many women's
lives and set them to dreaming about life in the West.
   ``Soviet women have a lot more respect for American men than for
Soviet men,'' said Sergei Kurochkin, 39, a former computer software
designer who founded Godsend last April.
   ``They say Soviet men are lazy, unfaithful and rude. They want
someone who will hold doors open for them.''
   Again and again, those sentiments are reflected in the seductive
short letters that women who join Godsend write about themselves.
   ``I'm kind and sensitive and I want to marry a gentleman,''
wrote Maria. ``I want to look after him.''
   ``For me, the ideal husband is an American man,'' wrote Galya,
28. ``I would like someone 30-35 years old, intelligent, who ...
wants to start a family on the basis of mutual respect, tenderness
and love.''
   Many letters also brim with frustration over the competing
demands of working full-time, shopping and keeping a home.
Kurochkin said the choice of most Soviet women is clear: ``They
love their homes. They want to be in their kitchens.''
   For $25, an American man can receive a packet of a dozen such
letters and photographs from a Los Angeles-based agency called
American-Russian Matchmaking.
   After corresponding by mail, the would-be American groom can
arrange through Godsend to come to the Soviet Union for 10 days to
meet his prospective mate, a trip that costs between $1,500 and
$4,000.
   If he ends up marrying one of the women, the price rises even
more: by contract, he's obligated to pay the matchmakers $3,000.
   Still, there seems to be plenty of interest. After the U.S. Army
magazine Stars and Stripes published a picture of some of the
women, it got phone calls from U.S. servicemen in Saudi Arabia,
asking for the matchmaking firm's address.
   Kurochkin said he's still working out the bugs in his system.
Originally, he offered to link American women with Soviet men, but
found little demand and dropped the service. Some Soviet men shake
their heads at their American counterparts who change diapers and
share household chores.
   Recently, Kurochkin began requiring Soviet women to say whether
they smoke, because bean-sprout-and-whole-wheat types from
California were appalled to be matched with chain-smokers.
   So far, no marriages have resulted from Godsend's efforts.
Kurochkin said the first may be in late January or early February,
when a Soviet woman plans to fly to the United States to join an
American man she met through the agency in November.

<HEAD>GAO Chief Raps Treasury Plan to Boost Bank Insurance Fund</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's top auditor says a Treasury
Department idea for increasing the dwindling insuranc fund for
bank deposits looks like an accounting gimmick.
   Charles A. Bowsher, head of the General Accounting Office, told
the House Banking Committee on Thursday that requiring banks to
purchase preferred stock from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
``gives us great concern.''
   Bowsher's statement came in response to a question from Rep.
Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the committee, who called
the proposal ``highly unusual.''
   ``Does this pass the auditor's sniff test?'' Gonzalez asked.
   ``It worries us,'' Bowsher replied, explaining that the plan
allows both the government fund and banks to count the same money
as an asset.
   Currently, banks support the fund by paying deposit insurance
premiums, which are treated as an expense and deducted from bank
earnings.
   Under the preferred stock proposal, the insurance fund would get
the banks' money - $14 billion to $28 billion over five years - and
the banks would get a dividend-earning preferred stock certificate
that would count as an asset, rather than as an expense.
   ``We start to fall into the trap of what I call accounting
gimmicks,'' Bowsher said.
   The problem would arise if the bank fund sinks deeper into
trouble. If accountants doubt the FDIC stock could be redeemed at
face value, they would probably force banks to write it down and
take a loss.
   In a speech last week, FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman said the
preferred stock plan was among three options being studied to shore
up the dwindling Bank Insurance Fund. By year end, the fund is
expected to have only about $10 billion protecting insured deposits
of nearly $2 trillion.
   One option would be another increase in deposit insurance
premiums, on top of the more than 60 percent increase taking effect
Jan. 1. Another is a one-time assessment on banks.
   Both would burden the industry at a time of declining profits.
However, critics of the preferred stock plan say it would only
postpone recognition of the burden.
   Bowsher said he was considering telling Treasury Secretary
Nicholas F. Brady that the GAO, as auditor of the FDIC, would
``look very closely'' at the preferred stock proposal.
   Brady has acknowledged the Bank Insurance Fund may need a cash
infusion and has pledged that the money will come from the
industry, not taxpayers.

   Native groups have formed ``human
blockades'' to stop logging on Borneo island, idling hundreds of
timber workers since last month, an official says.
   Logging camps in the Kapit, Ulu Belaga, Baram and Limbang areas
of Sarawak state were forced to close, causing substantial losses
to timber companies, Lau Hui Kang, chairman of the Sarawak Timber
Association, said Thursaday.
   Some of the nomadic Penans and other natives, who live off the
jungle, say logging has prevented them from hunting and finding
food. Friends of the Earth and other environmental organizations
have sided with the Penans over the past four years.
   The government of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad claims only
1,000 of the 10,000 Penans are nomadic and they too should settle.

<HEAD>Higher Domestic Demand for Rice Making Up for Export Drop</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Domestic use of rice, including large
quantities to make beer, is rising enough to take up some of the
slack caused by a drop in exports, the Agriculture Department says.
   Total U.S. production, at an estimated 154.4 million
hundredweight, is about the same as last year, although yields
dropped sharply in Arkansas and some other areas.
   All told, the U.S. rice stockpile by the end of the 1990-91
marketing year next summer may be about 23.7 million hundredweight,
the smallest in a decade and only a fraction of the carryovers - up
to 77.6 million in 1986 - in some previous years.
   Recent supply-and-demand figures show domestic use and
``residual'' will be around 88.8 million hundredweight in 1990-91,
up from 82.4 million last season. Residual includes unreported
uses, processing losses and statistical errors.
   Exports are projected at 73 million hundredweight, compared with
76.8 million in 1989-90 and 85.9 million in 1988-89.
   The December issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine said world
rice production this year is expected to be at a record level. And
that is making export competition tougher.
   ``Iraq, the fourth largest importer in 1989, accounted for 4
percent of global imports,'' the report said. ``Further, Iraq was
the largest market for U.S. rice last year, taking about 13 percent
of U.S. exports.''
   The analysis said the United Nations embargo is expected to
reduce Iraq's total rice imports by about 44 percent in 1991.
   But ``the embargo had a smaller impact on 1990 imports because
most of the rice had already been delivered before the embargo was
imposed,'' the report added.
   Rice is grown mostly in six states: Arkansas, California,
Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri and Texas. Arkansas, with
production estimated at 60 million hundredweight, accounts for
nearly 40 percent of this year's crop.
   Martha R. Evans of USDA's economics management staff said rice
is grown on about 12,000 farms in the United States and is ``the
most expensive of the major commodities to produce on a per-acre
basis. It is completely dependent on irrigation and its production
is highly mechanized.''
   Evans, writing in Farmline magazine, said rice is a major food
for more than half the world's people.
   Rice in the United States was first produced in Appalachia and
the Southeast. After the Civil War, however, Louisiana and Texas
become more competitive because they had plenty of level, fertile,
cheap land and not as many trees.
   ``Expansion continued into Arkansas and eventually into
California, Mississippi and Missouri,'' Evans said. ``Recently,
rice production has increased in Florida.''
   She noted the increase in rice yields, from an average of 1,144
pounds per acre in 1895 to 3,061 pounds in 1955. This year's
harvest is estimated at 5,499 pounds per acre.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Once the goal of breeding new plants was to
increase their yields of food and fiber needed for survival of the
human species. An Agriculture Department report shows how times
have changed.
   Henry L. Shands of the department's Agricultural Research
Service said in the report Thursday that about a hundred times a
year agency researchers release new plant varieties that have
special traits to let them thrive even if there are viruses,
bacteria, fungi, insects, bad weather and poor soils.
   Shands is the agency's national program leader for research on
germplasm - the genetic material in seeds, cuttings and live
plants.
   Even during the 1960s, he said, the primary aim of more than
half the new plant strains released by the agency was to boost
yields. Not today.
   ``The research strives to customize a crop to withstand
diseases, pests and environmental stresses such as drought, while
preserving traits for high yield,'' Shands said.
   In a five-year period, 1984 to 1989, the USDA research agency
made 599 germplasm releases that had improved resistance to some
pest or disease.
   ``These releases consisted of 147 actual plant varieties and 452
germplasm lines - strains of plants with useful traits that
breeders can transfer into existing varieties,'' he said.
   Approximately 80 percent of the releases over the five years had
improved disease resistance, 30 percent had improved insect
resistance and about 10 percent had improved resistance to
nematodes, tiny worms in soil.
   Some releases contained more than one kind of resistance, which
Shands said pushed the total to mcent.
   The current U.S. germplasm collections include nearly 400,000
plant introductions, cultivars and germplasm releases, he said. The
core than 100 perollections are a source of a steady supply of new crop
varieties.
   ``In the United States alone, farmers grow more than 200
varieties of wheat, 85 varieties of cotton, 200 varieties of
soybeans and many kinds of fruit, vegetables and ornamental
crops,'' Shands said. ``Disease and pest resistance must be bred
into each of these varieties, which often thrive only in specific
growing areas.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Agriculture Department says farmers who
participated in the 1990 wheat, barley and oats program will
receive more than $1.7 billion in cash payments.
   Keith Bjerke, executive vice president of the department's
Commodity Credit Corp., said Thursday that the subsidies would be
paid by county (AP) - As President Bush nears the end of his
South American tour, he is encouraged by the promised release of
hostages from Iraq and Kuwait but says this is no time to relax
military pressure on Saddam Hussein.
   After concluding a 24-hour visit to Chile, Bush was heading
today for Venezuela, a longtime U.S. friend and major oil producer
and the last stop on his five-nation swing to promote democracy and
free trade.
   Bush has praised Venezuela for increasing oil production after
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. The Venezuelan move has helped to ease
inflation in world oil prices.
   The price of oil has fluctuated wildly since August, rising when
Persian Gulf tensions increased and receding when peace prospects
seemed to improve. Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Peres has
called for talks among consumers and producers to see if a way can
be found to stabilize prices.
   Officials said Venezuela advocates creation of a hemispheric oil
reserve for emergencies, but that the United States has so far
shown little interest in the idea.
   In Chile, there was a spate of bombings and anti-Bush
demonstrations Thursday, but the overall reception seemed friendly.
Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater called the welcome
``terrific.''
   Bush hailed Chile's return to the democratic fold in March and
praised the government for a reform policy that has led to a surge
in economic growth.
   Once again, the gulf crisis intruded on Bush's activities
Thursday. He was flying to Chile from Buenos Aires, Argentina, when
word came of the prospective release of about 900 American
hostages. Fitzwater called the Iraqi announcement ``a hopeful
sign.''
   Release of the hostages has been a key demand of the United
States and the global coalition against Iraq, along with the
withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Kuwait, the restoration of the
exiled emir and a guarantee of security in the gulf.
   But, at a news conference Thursday, Bush said Saddam's show of
flexibility will not affect his gulf policy. Bush said Saddam
``must leave Kuwait without reservation, without condition.''
   ``We've got to continue to keep the pressure on,'' said Bush,
who has authorized the deployment of more than 400,000 Americans to
the gulf.
   The president promised there would not be any secret deal with
Saddam to end the gulf crisis. ``There are no secret negotiations,
direct or indirect with Iraq over this question,'' he said. ``None.
And there will be none.''
   Bush's Chilean visit was the first by an American president in
30 years. The welcome was not uniformly friendly.
   Before Bush arrived, the guerrillas exploded a half-dozen bombs
overnight at sites with U.S. ties, including four Mormon chapels, a
new McDonald's restaurant and a downtown park outside a hotel where
some officials in Bush's advance party were staying.
   The president's limousine was hit by an egg thrown from the
crowd as his motorcade passed through Santiago streets. Police
reported no injuries.
   Police used tear gas and water cannon to scatter scores of
university students who staged an anti-Bush protest at a campus in
the southern section of the city. The students threw rocks at
police and blocked traffic for two hours in front of the campus.
They burned at least two U.S. flags and waved several Cuban flags.
   Later, shortly before Bush's arrival for a dinner at the
presidential palace, police dispersed demonstrators who were
shouting anti-American slogans.
   Bush also visited Brazil and Uruguay, and he returns to
Washington Saturday.

<TEXT>
   Iran says it has arrested 7,000 drug
addicts and smugglers, only days after Amnesty International
condemned such arrests and said Iran had killed more than 1,100
alleged drug traffickers in 1989.
   Tehran radio, monitored in Nicosia, quoted the director of the
anti-drugs squads of the Islamic Revolutionary Committees as saying
Thursday that 6,247 addicts, and 651 drug smugglers were arrested
in the crackdown.
   The official, identified only as Yabu, said 350 pounds of drugs
were confiscated in raids over the past month.
   He warned that a massive follow-up operation would be launched
today to ``wipe out centers where addicts and smugglers
congregate.''
   Yabu said 715 checkpoints were to be set up to catch traffickers
today.
   Iranians generally mock such operations, which are announced in
advance.
   ``If I were a drug smuggler, do you think I would be stupid
enough to transport my goods on a day when everybody is out looking
for me?'' said an Iranian businessman in Tehran last week.
   Iran has executed more than 1,500 alleged drug smugglers, and
jailed over 70,000 so-called addicts since December 1988, according
to official figures.
   Possession of even small quantities of drugs, with intent to
sell, carries a mandatory death sentence under Iran's laws.
   Iranian opposition groups say the drug-related killings and
arrests mask a crackdown on political opponents.
   Amnesty International, the London-based human rights
organization, said in report Tuesday that Iran executed 5,000
political opponents in the past three years.
   The Amnesty report coincided with a resolution passed by the
United Nations Third Committee condemning human rights violations
in Iran.

<HEAD>New Contraceptive Implant Expected to be Available in February</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new contraceptive is expected to be
available in the United States beginning in February, giving women
their first major new option in decades, the manufacturer says.
   Norplant consists of six match stick-size silicone rubber
capsules that are implanted in a minor surgical procedure under the
skin of a woman's upper arm. For five years, the capsules release a
hormone to prevent pregnancy, but they can be removed - and
fertility restored - at any time.
   The Food and Drug Administration is expected to approve the
contraceptive within days.
   ``It offers them a new choice which is long-lasting and
convenient, uses the lowest dose of hormone that's used in any
(hormone-based method) and it doesn't contain estrogen,'' said C.
Wayne Bardin, vice president and director of medical research for
the New York-based Population Council.
   The council began researching the method in 1966. Wyeth-Ayerst
Laboratories of Philadelphia will market the contraceptive.
   Norplant has been approved in 16 countries. Half a million
people in those countries have used Norplant, according to the
council's data.
   ``It's the most effective, reversible method of contraception,''
with a failure rate of less than 1 percent, said Dr. Samuel A.
Pasquale, a principal investigator in the Norplant studies and an
associate dean at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New
Brunswick, N.J.
   ``Norplant is one of the most significant advances in
contraception we've had in the last 30 years,'' since the birth
control pill and intrauterine device became available, Pasquale
said.
   The major side effect is menstrual irregularities, including
spotting between periods and prolonged periods. This causes about
15 percent of women with the implant to have it removed, Bardin
said.
   Wyeth-Ayerst officials were reluctant to talk about Norplant on
Thursday without FDA approval of their product yet.
   Company spokeswoman Audrey Ashby said that assuming approval
comes shortly, the company expects Norplant to be available
commercially in February. Wyeth-Ayerst plans to train physicians
how to implant the capsules, but ``there will be some lag time,''
she said. ``Obviously not every physician will be trained to do
it'' by the time it is available.
   Ashby said the price of Norplant was being evaluated but she
said it ``will be priced significantly below oral contraceptives
over five years.'' Birth control pills cost around $15 to $20 per
month.
   Bardin said he had been told the price would be about $200 to
$300 for Norplant, which does not include the price of having the
implant.
   The price worries Lisa Kaeser, a policy analyst for the Alan
Guttmacher Institute, a research and education group that deals
with reproductive health issues.
   ``I'm not sure it's going to be available for low-income
women,'' she said. That will depend largely on Wyeth-Ayerst's price
of the contraceptive to family planning clinics.
   Bardin said Norplant fits the needs of many women but is
particularly well-suited to those who have completed their family
size but don't want to become sterilized and for women who want to
delay pregnancy for a fixed time.
   It also is a good choice for women who don't want to take
estrogen, which is in most birth control pills and is a risk for
women with a family history of breast cancer, he said.
   The capsules are implanted in a minor surgical procedure with
local anesthesia. Generally, they are not noticeable. When they are
removed, the contraceptive effects are reversed and the woman is as
fertile as she was before the implant.
   It's not clear yet how Norplant will be accepted by American
women. The contraceptive is popular in the countries where it has
been approved, Bardin said.
   ``It's a matter of public education, of people recognizing that
they can have it taken out when they wish,'' Kaeser said.

<HEAD>Investigators: Other Pilots Were Confused in Same Area as Fatal
Collision</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ROMULUS, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Airline pilots told investigators they had
become confused while taxiing in the same runway area where two
Northwest Airlines jets collided in heavy fog this week, killing
eight people.
   The unidentified pilots, not involved in the fatal collision,
volunteered the information in interviews with the National
Transportation Safety Board team looking into Monday's crash, head
investigator John Lauber said Thursday.
   Previous confusion among pilots at Detroit Metropolitan Airport
was reported ``and not necessarily under low visibility
conditions,'' Lauber said at a news conference held before most of
the team left Detroit.
   Investigators used a DC-9 jet Thursday to reconstruct the errant
path taken by a Northwest DC-9 through heavy fog onto runway 3-C,
where a Northwest Boeing 727 was thundering toward takeoff for
Memphis, Tenn.
   Lauber said reconstructing the events leading up to the crash
helped investigators document what the cockpit crew may have seen,
including ``all taxiway markings, runway markings, the lights, the
signs.''
   Eight people were killed and 20 were injured when the
Pittsburgh-bound DC-9, carrying 39 passengers and four crew
members, apparently made two wrong turns and ended up in the path
of the other jet.
   The 145 passengers and eight crew aboard the Boeing 727 jet
escaped injury.
   Investigators have said poor visibility, inadequate runway
lighting and pilot and control-tower error could have contributed
to the crash.
   ``We wouldn't, at this stage, rule out anything,'' Lauber said.
   About 70 NTSB workers have been conducting interviews and
investigations. Remaining investigators hoped to finish field work
over the weekend.
   ``We've gotten to the point where the factual part of this is
starting to wind down. Now it's all analyzing the data,'' agency
spokesman Brent Bahler said.
   A final report could take as long as a year to complete.
   On Wednesday, Milio Rinna, 60, of Allen Park, a passenger on the
DC-9, filed a lawsuit against Northwest in Wayne County Circuit
Court, the first suit filed against the airline after Monday's
crash.
   Rinna, a health and safety official with the United Steelworkers
union, suffered burns and other injuries after using his bare hands
to extinguish flames on another passenger, said his lawyer, William
L. Martens of Southfield.
   Martens and Northwest spokesman Bob Gibbons said Rinna's suit
probably would be the first of many.
   ``It seems inconceivable to me, given the number who were
injured and the number of deaths, that there will not be other
lawsuits,'' Martens said.
   Gibbons agreed, but declined further comment on legal action.
   Five passengers remained hospitalized today, listed in
conditions ranging from good to serious.

   More than a million workers staged a
one-day strike to protest an anti-strike law, and the capital was
engulfed in one of its worst traffic jams as cars flooded the
streets due to the lack of public transport.
   The strike Thursday by government workers and the country's
largest labor group, the General Confederation of Greek Workers,
included employees of public transit and utilities.
   In Athens, a city of 10 million, people fought for taxis and
traffic doubled as authorities abandoned an odd-even license plate
system that usually limits the number of private cars downtown.
   The new anti-strike law will allow the state to operate
utilities with skeleton staff during walkouts and make it easier to
fire strikers.
   The bill is due to become law on Saturday after passing
Wednesday. The governing conservative party holds 152 seats in the
300-member Parliament.

   The Palestinian uprising in the occupied
territories has made 42 percent of Israelis more hawkish, but
opinion on how to solve the problem is deeply fragmented, according
to an opinion poll.
   The uprising is 3 years old on Saturday.
   The survey published Thursday said 45 percent had experienced no
change of opinion, and only 6 percent had become more dovish. Seven
percent had no opinion.
   The sounding of 1,200 adult Israeli Jews was conducted by the
Smith Research Center for the Jerusalem Report, a weekly news
magazine. No margin of error was given.
   On the question of how to solve the conflict, 25 percent favored
some sort of statehood for the 1.7 million Palestinians of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, the poll said.
   Twenty-one percent wanted to expel all or some of the
Palestinians from the occupied territories, and 20 percent thought
Israel should withdraw from the Gaza Strip, regarded as the most
troublesome occupied area.
   Only 6 percent of those questioned favored annexing the West
Bank, 9 percent opted for preserving the present situation, and 19
pecent had no opinion, it said.
   ``People are very confused about where to go,'' the Jerusalem
Report quoted pollster Hanoch Smith as saying.
   ``Antagonism toward Arabs is at an all-time high,'' he said.

<HEAD>American U. Trustees Rescind $1 Million Offer to Ex-President</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American University trustees rescinded their
$1 million buyout offer to former President Richard Berendzen, who
pleaded guilty to making obscene telephone calls, and will allow
him to return to campus as a faculty member.
   Board Chairman Edward Carr said all 27 trustees present at a
special meeting Thursday agreed to withdraw the initial settlement
offer. He said the board supports the alternative agreement
spearheaded by interim President Milton Greenberg in consultation
with faculty committees and agreed to by Berendzen.
   ``I hope today's events will allow us to put the turmoil of the
past month behind us,'' said Carr.
   Carr met with reporters after the two-hour trustees meeting
during which student, faculty and staff groups voiced strong
opposition to the initial settlement. The school's alumni
association called for Berendzen to sever all ties with the
university.
   Berendzen, 51, resigned as president abruptly last April, citing
fatigue. The next month, he pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor
charges of making obscene telephone calls from his university
office to a woman living in a Virginia suburb of Washington.
   He was sentenced to two 30-day jail terms, which were suspended
provided he stays out of trouble for one year and continues
psychological treatment.
   Although Carr declined to discuss specifics, the initial offer
reportedly would have reached $1 million and included more than
$600,000 in appreciation for Berendzen's contributions in raising
the university's image and prestige.
   Under the alternative agreement, Berendzen will be on
administrative leave with pay at his faculty salary, for the
1990-91 academic year and the fall 1991 semester. The salary will
be in the range of $70,000, officials said.
   Berendzen, who throughout the ordeal had continued to draw his
annual salary of about $140,000 since resigning as president in
April, will return in the spring of 1992 as a full professor of
physics.
   In rescinding the offer, Carr said the action does not affect
severance payments to Berendzen provided for in his presidential
contract. He estimated the amount at slightly less than $400,000.
   Testifying before the board, alumni association president Gayle
Abbott said her group felt strongly ``that the best interests of
American University mandate that AU sever all ties with Dr.
Berendzen as expeditiously as possible.''

   Germany is paying a price for
unification in increased traffic casualties, with the number of
fatal accidents nearly doubling in former East Germany, the federal
statistics office says.
   Traffic deaths in Germany's five new eastern states and former
East Berlin are expected to reach 3,330 for the year, compared to
1,784 in 1989, a statistics office news release said Thursday.
   Since the opening of German borders and the fall of the Berlin
Wall last fall, many eastern Germans have switched from two-stroke
Trabant cars to powerful Western models that can exceed 100 miles
an hour.
   The Western cars and inexperienced drivers on crumbling roads
have proven to be a deadly combination, according to news reports.
   Traffic deaths for the western two-thirds of the newly united
nation are expected to increase by only 1.3 percent this year, or
100 over last year's 8,000 fatalities, the statistics office said.

   Some of Manuel Noriega's taped prison conversations
were in code, including passages in which the deposed Panamanian
dictator apparently discussed frozen funds, court transcripts show.
   Many of the conversations included in transcripts released by a
federal judge Thursday dealt with family affairs, but some
apparently involved money transfers and others showed Noriega
followed Panamanian politics after he was ousted during a U.S.
invasion in December 1989. Among the apparently coded calls was one
by Noriega to the Cuban Embassy in Panama.
   The government tapes, some of which were broadcast by CNN last
month, triggered a battle pitting freedom of the press against
Noriega's right to a fair trial.
   After first ordering CNN to halt the broadcasts, U.S. District
Judge William Hoeveler ruled last week that the tapes were harmless
to Noriega's defense, and allowed the network to resume the
broadcasts.
   This week, the judge agreed to a request by media organizations
to release court transcripts of the tapes, over the objections of
CNN. The network dropped its objections Wednesday.
   In one transcript, Norma Amado, mother of Noriega's mistress,
talked in apparent code with him about why ``the man'' had not
arrived. The conversation appeared to be about frozen funds.
   Amado said the man would go elsewhere because ``it's not frozen
there ... since we are all frozen here and over there it wouldn't
be a problem.''
   She also discussed the need for ``a good towel ... and the
important thing is it shouldn't be a hand (towel.)''
   CNN has said that conversation also included coded discussions
about the transfer of $4 million.
   In a call to the Cuban Embassy, Noriega said he would send a
facsimile transmission ``so you can grab it and pass it on to the
grandfather.''
   Another transcript had Noriega urging an unidentified man to
encourage opposition to the new Panamanian government.
   ``We must explain ... that one must unite, that there are people
with ambition that are now going to take over the party,'' he said.
   The transcripts included five tapes, most containing several
conversations.
   In one previously telecast conversation, Noriega speculated
about two potential government witnesses with his lawyer's
secretary, who was translating for a defense investigator. That
conversation triggered the original objection by Noriega's
attorneys, who said broadcastingit would violate lawyer-client
privilege and hurt his chances of getting a fair trial.
   The transcripts showed that Noriega was commenting on an article
in El Nuevo Herald, the Spanish-language edition of The Miami
Herald, about the arrest of the two men, Alfredo Sanchez and Felipe
Camargo.
   The news organizations that went to court for the transcripts
were The Miami Herald, The Associated Press, Post-Newsweek station
WPLG-TV of Miami and Gannett Co. Inc. and USA Today, which Gannett
owns. They argued that the public has a right to examine the
content of tapes that ignite a free-speech controversy.
   Noriega's defense team claims the Panamanian government gave the
tapes to CNN after receiving them from the U.S. government. Taping
prisoners telephone callsis legal.
   Noriega is awaiting trial on drug trafficking charges the he
took $4.6 million in payoffs to protect the cocaine trade passing
through Panama from Colombia to the United States.

   In a nearby classrom some students were
singing Christmas carols while Federica Tacconi took notes about
some homework at the end of a German lesson.
   ``Looking through the window I suddenly saw it coming. It was
coming slowly, silently, as if it was pushed by the wind, its wings
tilting. ... I was paralyzed by dread. I heard someone screaming,
then a rumble and the wall collapsed,'' she recalled in tears.
   Federica, 16, was one of the four Italian students of a class of
16 who survived the crash of a flaming military jet into a
classroom in a suburban high school Thursday.
   Pulled free from the wreckage of a wing, she suffered a crushed
pelvis and burns but was not in danger of life, doctors at Bologna
Maggiore hospital said.
   Twelve of her classmates were killed instantly when the
pilotless jet plowed into a high school at Casalecchio, three miles
outside Bologna. The engine had caught fire, forcing the pilot to
bail out.
   At the time of the crash, 285 students, 28 teachers and four
monitors were at the Gaetano Salvemini vocational high school,
authorities said.
   The teacher who had just completed a German lesson was
hospitalized in nearby Parma with critical burn injuries.
   In nearby classrooms panic spread because of the flames and
heavy smoke but many did not immediately realize what had happened.
   ``It's an earthquake, some of my friends shouted. I thought of a
bomb, or the explosion of a heating boiler. I could not believe it
had been a jet,'' said Federico Bonanni, 18, who reached the ground
safely, from a third floor classroom, on ladders quickly brought by
firefighters.
   Many survivors panicked and jumped from the windows before
arrival of firemen, a few minutes after the accident.
   In total those injured were 87, including a firefighter and the
jet pilot, who bailed out shortly before the crash.
   The prosecutor's office and a military commission are
investigating the crash. The cause of the engine fire was not
immediately known.
   Gen. Carlo Brandini said the plane was on a mission to test the
effectiveness of an anti-aircraft radar system and had taken off
from Villafranca military airport near Verona, 55 miles north of
Bologna.
   He said the MB-326 Aermacchi was flying at about 280 mph when
trouble developed in its single engine, which then burst into
flames.
   Italian Air Force officers said the pilot, 2nd Lt. Bruno
Viviani, stuck to the emergency procedure as he tried to land his
stricken craft into the fields after unloading most of the fuel.
   But the fire forced Viviani to bail out, paramilitary officers
reported.
   Several eyewitnesses saw the military jet, painted in bright
orange, coming down slowly in flames and hit the three-story school
after grazing a five-floor condominium complex.
   Officers reported that the pilot was not immediately told of the
high death toll claimed by the crash.
   Federica also did not know that 12 of her classmates were
killed.
   ``I hope Carmen and Laura managed to jump from the window, or
flee through the corridor,'' she said.
   Carmen Schrinzi and Laura Corazza, both 16, were listed among
the known victims.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls, Stock Prices Rally</HEAD>

   The dollar fell against the Japanese yen Friday,
while share prices rose sharply.
   The dollar closed at 132.17 yen, down 1.88 yen from Thursday's
close at 134.05 yen. After opening at 132.58 yen, it ranged between
132.10 yen and 132.80 yen.
   On the stock exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues ended at 23,522.49 points, up 969.39 points or 4.30 percent
from Thursday's finish at 22,553.10 points.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds rose to 87.02 points as of 3 p.m. (1 a.m.
EST) from Thursday's close of 86.68.Their yield fell to 7.270
percent from 7.345 percent.
   News of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's announcement Thursday
that he will free all foreign hostages by Christmas brought the
dollar down and sent share prices higher, traders said. Market
players sold the dollar as prospects for war dimmed with the
report.
   The U.S. currency is regarded as a safe investment in times of
international tension, while the possibility of a peaceful
resolution of the gulf crisis tends to strengthen the yen because
of Japan's near-total dependence on oil imports.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's fall followed its overnight
decline in New York to 132.14 yen.
   But additional news confirming the United States' firm demands
for Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait made nervous market players buy
back the dollar, said a dealer at Sumitomo Bank, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Akihiko Kagawa, a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, said the U.S.
currency was oversold earlier. ``I think the dollar will regain
strength now that market-affecting news has come out,'' he said.

<HEAD>Liz Taylor Keeps Control of `Passion' Perfume in Out-of-Court
Settlement</HEAD>

   The courtroom stink over Elizabeth Taylor's
Passion perfume evaporated when the legendary actress reached an
agreement with her former boyfriend.
   Miss Taylor retains control of the Passion perfume line, which
has earned $70 million, under terms of the agreement announced
Thursday.
   Her ex-boyfriend Henry Wynberg will drop a lawsuit against the
actress in which he claimed he developed the fragrance, and Miss
Taylor will drop a countersuit against Wynberg.
   ``It means I'm vindicated and it proves the perfume, Passion, is
something I worked a year and a half for,'' Miss Taylor said after
Superior Court Judge Coleman Swart announced the settlement.
   Both sides will pay their own legal fees and no money will
change hands, said Miss Taylor's attorney, Neil Papiano.
   Swart said the settlement was made ``with prejudice,'' meaning
neither Wynberg or Miss Taylor can raise the issue again.
   Wynberg and his attorney, Quentin Kopp, refused to confirm that
Wynberg won't get any money. In his lawsuit, he asked for nearly
three-quarters of Passion's profits.
   The settlement was reached during jury selection for a trial
that had promised to be embarrassing to both sides.
   Attorneys for Wynberg, a former used car salesman who was Miss
Taylor's boyfriend between her two marriages to actor Richard
Burton in the 1970s, said they would bring up the Academy
Award-winning actress' highly publicized bouts with alcohol and
obesity.
   Miss Taylor's attorneys said they would bring up Wynberg's
guilty pleas to charges of statutory rape, providing underage girls
with drugs in return for sex and taking pornographic photos of
young girls.
   Miss Taylor acknowledged she was glad to avoid the trial.
   ``It's not something I was looking forward to, but I was willing
to fight as long as I had to,'' she said.
   Jury selection was highlighted Thursday by a prospective juror's
statement that he had seen most of Miss Taylor's silent films,
which brought laughter from the actress and others in the packed
courtroom.
   Miss Taylor, 58, wasn't born until after the silent movie era
ended. Her more than 50 films include ``National Velvet,'' ``Who's
Afriad of Virginia Woolf?,'' ``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,'' and
``Butterfield 8,'' for which she won an Academy Award as best
actress.
   Wynberg claimed he was the creator of Passion, and said Miss
Taylor breached a contract with him to develop the popular
fragrance. The pair signed an agreement in Burton's presence in
1975 for Wynberg to market cosmetics under Miss Taylor's name.
   But the actress said Wynberg breached the contract by not
following through and developing a product.

   A cat chewed two fingers off a
2-month-old infant girl's hand and authorities are considering
whether to charge a baby sitter with child neglect.
   Sara Elizabeth Culler's fingers were retrieved from the cat's
stomach Tuesday, but they were too badly damaged to reattach, said
the girl's father, Tom Culler.
   ``She's a good baby,'' Culler said. ``When she cries, you know
something's wrong. The question is where was the baby sitter? From
the damage done, it is obvious that cat was working on her for a
while.''
   The baby sitter, whose name was withheld pending any formal
charges, operated a day care center from her home in Pittsfield
Township. The license for the child care operation lapsed in
September.
   ``Chances are I'm going to send it back ... to investigators,
for further investigation,'' Washtenaw County assistant prosecutor
David Lady said Wednesday. ``No decision will be made in the
immediate future.''

<HEAD>Former Noriega Aide Pleads Guilty, Ties Ousted Dictator to Drug
Cash</HEAD>

   The U.S. government gained a key ally in its
prosecution of Manuel Noriega when a former aide admitted
delivering drug money to the deposed Panamanian dictator and agreed
to testify against his former boss.
   ``The admission is significant,'' U.S. attorney's office
spokeswoman Diane Cossin said Thursday. ``The defense attorney has
asserted that his client is very knowledgeable.''
   Luis del Cid, 47, a lieutenant colonel under Noriega, admitted
Thursday that he was a ``liaison, courier and emissary for Manuel
Antonio Noriega in his transactions with drug traffickers.''
   He had faced a possible 70-year prison term if convicted on four
racketeering counts. In exchange for the guilty plea to one count,
the government dropped the other three and recommended a 10-year
sentence.
   Prosecutors said they would consider reducing that to three
years if del Cid cooperates fully. That could mean he would leave
prison by early 1992, defense attorney Sam Burstyn said.
   The plea bargain boosted the government's drug case against
Noriega after months of disputes over frozen bank accounts,
attorneys fees and leaked tapes of Noriega's prison phone calls.
   Prosecutors said del Cid gave Noriega $100,000 in cash from drug
pilot and star prosecution witness Floyd Carlton Caceres in
November 1982. Del Cid received an envelope with $150,000 cash from
Carlton in 1983, and also picked up a suitcase stuffed with cash -
both of which were delivered to Noriega.
   ``Yes I transported the money, but, well, I am repentant at
having done so,'' del Cid told U.S. District Judge William
Hoeveler. ``What I was doing was following orders of a superior
officer.''
   Plea negotiations had stalled in March because del Cid feared he
would be sent back to Panama for criminal prosecution after
pleading guilty in the United States.
   Burstyn said the agreement eliminated that problem: ``He will
never be sent anywhere that he does not want to go.''
   Del Cid will testify against Noriega, his lawyer said.
   He could back up testimony by Carlton, who served 4{ years in
prison and is now under federal protection, and of Panamanian
businessman Enrique ``Kiki'' Pretelt, who has pleaded guilty in a
parallel Tampa marijuana case against Noriega.
   Noriega is accused of taking $4.6 million in bribes to ship
cocaine through Panama.

<HEAD>Study Reveals That Straying Blackbird Males Father Many Chicks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Redwing blackbirds form bonded pairs withing a
defended territory, but neither partner appears to care much about
remaining faithful, a researcher says.
   Genetic tests show that up to a third of all redwing blackbird
chicks are fathered by lusty males that cuckold their neighbors.
   ``It's clear that there is mating outside of the socially bonded
pairs,'' said H. Lisle Gibbs, a biologist at Queen's University in
Ontario, Canada. But just which bird is untrue - the male or the
female - is still not clear, he said Thursday.
   Whatever the case, Gibbs said, genetic tests run on blood
samples taken from 36 redwing blackbird families in a Canadian
marsh showed that about a third of all chicks were fathered by
males that lived in neighboring territories.
   In effect, a male often is defending a nest that contains
another bird's offspring.
   A report on the study was to be published Friday in the journal
Science.
   Gibbs said earlier studies of blackbirds tried to determine
reproductive success by counting the number of chicks in nests
within a territory defended by a specific male.
   ``Our work shows that is clearly an inaccurate measure of
success'' because so many of the chicks are actually fathered by
males from other territories, he said.
   Redwing blackbirds spend virtually all spring and summer trying
to assure their personal success at reproduction.
   Males, Gibbs said, stake out a territory in March or April and
spend the rest of the season defending it.
   ``To get any mating success, a male redwing has to hold a piece
of turf,'' he said. ``They will spend days fighting, defending
their territory. There is a long period of conflict even before the
females show up.''
   When the females do arrive, ``the males put on quite a show
trying to attract the ladies,'' Gibbs said.
   A male is successful when one or more females chooses to build a
nest in his territory. The pair mate and, except for a little home
defense, the male's job is over.
   Over the course of a season, a successful male may lure up to
five females to nest in his territory. He will defend each nest but
won't help raise any of the chicks.
   ``It's not like other monogamous species where both act to feed
the young,'' Gibbs said. ``That's the difference in this mating
system.''
   Biologists believe males in many species are driven to have as
many offspring as possible and, often, to defend their mates from
reproductive success of other males.
   But among the redwing blackbird, Gibbs said, ``there's a
definite conflict between the sexes'' because such a high
percentage of the young are fathered by outside males.
   ``The key question is whether females are going out and seeking
other males, or are males going out and coercing females,'' he
said. ``It could be a combination of both. But who's running the
show - the males or the females?''
   Though the answer must await more research, Gibbs noted: ``If I
had to guess, I would say it's the females.''
   Gibbs' team of researchers in the study included Peter T. Boag,
Lisa M. Tabak and Bradley N. White, all of Queen's University, and
P.J. Weatherhead and Drew J. Hoysak of Carleton University in
Ottawa.

   Nearly 50 years after Japanese planes bombed Pearl
Harbor, some Japanese are trying to persuade their government to
apologize for the attack.
   Atsuyuki Sassa, a former government official, said Thursday he
hoped Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu would make a statement today,
the 49th anniversary of the attack that drew the United States into
World War II.
   With that possibility dimming, ``I am trying my best to get him
to make a comment on Jan. 1. We must do something before
(President) Bush's visit in the spring,'' said Sassa, who has
worked in the prime minister's office.
   Kenichi Takemura, a social commentator, called for a ``mutual
forgiveness week'' for the two countries in an interview with the
newspaper Sankei Seiron earlier this year.
   The paper quoted him as saying U.S.-Japan relations are bad
enough because of economic frictions, and could worsen next year if
the Pearl Harbor anniversary brings more bad feelings.
   Japan has apologized to South Korea and China for its military
actions in the 1930s and 1940s. No official apology has been issued
to the United States.
   A Foreign Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said he was not aware of any effort to promote an apology.
   Sassa said he is part of an informal group of about 30
government officials, diplomats and journalists who meet every
month to discuss a ``national grand design of Japan.''
   Sassa said other members of the group are cautious about voicing
their views for fear of retaliation by right-wingers, who have
staged violent attacks against critics of Japan's role in the war.
   Sassa said the apology idea occurred to him in 1985, when
Richard von Weizsacker, president of then-West Germany, included an
apology for World War II in a speech on the 40th anniversary of the
Nazis' surrender.
   ``Japanese are afflicted with collective amnesia about the war,
but those who suffered at our hands cannot forget,'' Sassa wrote in
an article that appeared in the Yomiuri Shimbun, the most widely
circulated Japanese newspaper, in September.
   Richard Armitage, former assistant secretary of defense, said in
a speech in Tokyo last month that Bush and Kaifu should make
reciprocal apologetic gestures.
   He said Kaifu should place a wreath on a memorial to the dead at
Pearl Harbor and Bush should pay homage to those who died after the
United States dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima Aug. 6, 1945.
Japan surrendered six days later.

   The death rate from lung cancer keeps increasing

   The national Centers for Disease Control said Thursday that lung
cancer incidence and death rates for 1987 continued a pattern of
increasing steadily for women, while fluctuating or holding steady
for men.
   The national lung cancer death rate rose slightly from 1980 to
1987, from 42.5 per 100,000 people to 47.9.
   The death rate for men rose by less than 5 deaths per 100,000
people, from 71.6 to 75.0, while the rate for women increased by
more than a third, from 20.9 per 100,000 in 1980 to 28.2 in 1987,
the CDC said.
   The Atlanta-based federal health agency also concluded that the
increase among women would continue into the next century.
   Lung cancer incidence nationwide increased from a rate of 52.4
per 100,000 people in 1980 to 55.5 in 1986 - the latest year
available - and increased faster for women than for men.
   Previous studies have said the increasing lung cancer death rate
among women may stem from their reduced willingness to quit
smoking, as compared to men. But researchers aren't sure that is
the only reason.
   ``I don't think it's fully understood why you have some more
rapid growing cancers for some people, and not for others,''said
Dr. Ronald Aubert, a CDC epidemiologist.
   CDC researchers estimate 85 percent of lung cancer cases are
caused by smoking, not counting cases caused by secondhand smoke,
Aubert said.
   The statistics ``are consistent with historically increasing
trends in smoking,'' the Atlanta-based CDC reported.
   Researchers said that because peaks in smoking are historically
followed by peaks in lung cancer as much as 35 years later, the
rate among women will likely increase for decades.
   ``Based on these trends, the increases ... for females are not
expected to plateau until after the year 2013,'' the CDC said.
   In general, lung cancer death rates in the 1980s have been
higher for black men than for white men, but did not differ
significantly between white and black women. Surveys have shown
that black men are more likely to smoke, and to smoke cigarettes
higher in tar and nicotine, the CDC said.

<HEAD>Medical Panel Calls for More Research on Female Biology</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Treatment of breast cancer and other women's
diseases is still hindered by ignorance about female biology, two
researchers say.
   ``There's no research on the normal breast,'' said Dr. Susan
Love, an author and professor of surgery at Harvard. ``Therefore,
we don't have a clue when carcinogens are acting.''
   Yet breast cancer will strike one woman in 10 in her lifetime,
and will kill 44,000 this year, she said.
   ``It is appalling that in 1990 we have little or no information
on the natural course of the endocrine and tissue changes that
occur during menopause,'' said Barbara Sherwin of McGill
University.
   The two medical experts were among more than 100 physicians and
other scientists who gathered for a symposium on ``Forging a
Women's Health Research Agenda.'' They spoke Thursday.
   Although panelists looked specifically at breast cancer,
menopause, cardiovascular disease and clinical pharmacology, there
were many common threads and a common set of recommendations.
   A key recommendation was that medical professionals consider
closely but also look beyond the biological factors unique to women
- such as the menstrual cycle, pregnancy and hormonal differences.
   They said professionals also need to gather data on individual
patients' social and economic status as risk factors - poverty,
raising children alone - and on ``psychosocial'' factors such as
depression, occupational stress and the multiple demands on women
as mothers, workers and spouses.

<HEAD>Woman Given 20-Year Sentence in Capitol Bombing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of two women described by a prosecutor as
terrorists has been handed a 20-year prison sentence for bombing
the U.S. Capitol and conspiring to set off seven other explosions.
   Laura Whitehorn, 45, was ordered jailed along with co-defendant
Linda Sue Evans. For her role in the conspiracy, Evans, 43, was
sentenced to five years after completing a 35-year sentence she is
already serving for illegally buying firearms.
   The two women, who pleaded guilty in a plea bargain Sept. 7,
were sentenced by U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene at a
proceeding punctuated by the cheers and applause of supporters who
packed the courtroom.
   ``You have committed acts of violence which are not excused by
good purposes or political purposes,'' Greene said. ``The effect of
these kinds of violence are just as devastating to the victims and
to society at large as if they were motivated by greed.''
   ``The defendants Linda Evans and Laura Whitehorn are
terrorists,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Margaret Ellen told the
judge. ``They are people who by their actions have souht to coerce
others by means of threats or violence.''
   The Nov. 7, 1983 bomb blast that blew a hole in the wall outside
the Senate chamber and the explosions at seven other locations in
Washington and New York City ``were not symbolic gestures; they
were distinct acts of terrorism,'' Ellen said.
   ``Only chance prevented serious harm'' to people, she said.
   Whitehorn received the maximum term for each of three charges to
which she pleaded guilty: conspiracy, malicious destruction of
government property and possession of equipment to make false
documents.
   In sentencing Evans, Greene said he was taking into account the
fact that she was already serving a 35-year prison term.

<HEAD>U.S. Official Accuses Japan of Hoarding Oil</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan has hoarded crude oil in the months
following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, despite agreement among most
consuming nations to draw down stockpiles and ease supply problems,
a senior Energy Department official claims.
   The matter will likely be raised next week at a meeting of the
governing board of the International Energy Agency said Linda
Stuntz, an Energy Department deputy under secretary for policy and
planning.
   The Paris-based agency is responsible for coordinating responses
by oil consuming nations in an oil supply emergency.
   ``If everybody in the world did what Japan is doing we would
have a much more serious problem than we do. Prices would be a lot
higher,'' said Ms. Stuntz in remarks to a group of reporters.
   She later said in an interview that she did not want to
overstate the concern, but added that Japan's actions raise
questions about the success of future cooperative activities among
consuming nations in response to oil supply shocks.
   Ms. Stuntz said that in the months after the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait last August, U.S. oil companies and most companies in Europe
drew down crude oil stocks in order to keep supplies adequate
without having to dramatically increase imports.
   But, she said, the Japanese, rather than drawing down crude oil
stocks after the loss of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil, elected instead to
continue importing at high levels and, in fact, increased imports
to meet additional demand.

<HEAD>Dollar Weakened, Stocks Up in Tokyo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's surprise
announcement that all foreigners can go home helped weaken the
dollar today in Tokyo and sent share prices up, traders said.
   The dollar closed at 132.17 yen, down 1.88 yen from Thursday's
close at 134.05 yen. After opening at 132.58 yen, it ranged from
132.10 yen to 132.80 yen.
   The day's spot trading totaled some $9.33 billion, compared with
$8.68 billion the previous day.
   Market players sold dollars as the news of the hostage release
dimmed prospects of military action in the Middle East, said Ikuo
Ikenaga, a dealer at the Security Pacific National Bank.
   In recent weeks, the dollar has tended to rise over speculation
of increasing international tensions as investors seek a safe-haven
currency.
   On the other hand, the likelihood of a peaceful solution in the
gulf is favorable for the yen because of Japan's almost total
dependence on oil imports.
   Dealers said subsequent technical adjustments prevented a
drastic decline of the dollar.
   On the stock exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average ended
at 23,522.49 points, up 969.39 points or 4.30 percent from
Thursday's finish at 22,553.10 points.
   Brokers said optimism about peace in the Middle East was the
biggest market-affecting factor on an active trading day. Volume on
the first section totaled 570 million shares.
   ``This is big news because no one had been buying, but there was
buying today,'' said Masahiro Umemori, a researcher at Nomura
Securities Co.
   He said the timing of the news was good because it came when
everyone was pessimistic and lethargic, and share prices were
heading toward hitting bottom. If it had come when the market was
rallying, the news would not have had the same impact, he added.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds rose to 87.31 points from Thursday's
close of 86.68. Their yield fell to 7.210 percent from 7.345
percent.

<HEAD>Lightning Detectors to Protect Jetliners from Volcanic Ash Clouds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lightning detectors will be used to track
ash clouds spewed by Alaskan volcanos, allowing jetliners to bypass
the clouds and avoid clogged engines, which nearly caused an
airline disaster last year.
   ``The lightning-detection system will help us warn the airline
industry so they can divert airplanes and prevent crashes,'' said
Tom Miller, scientist-in-charge of the U.S. Geological Survey's
Alaska Volcano Observatory.
   Volcanic ash plumes generate lightning bolts. Scientists don't
know why, but it means lightning detectors can be used to find and
track ash clouds from Redoubt Volcano and others in Alaska.
   ``That's useful information at a volcano you can't see most of
the time because of bad weather and short winter days,'' said Rick
Hoblitt, the USGS Cascades Volcano Observatory volcanologist who
dreamed up the idea of using the detectors to protect jetliners.
   The new $100,000 system of sensors will be installed in February
to protect heavy traffic at Anchorage International Airport,
Geological Survey researchers said Thursday at the American
Geophysical Union's fall meeting.
   The detection system consists of direction-finding antennas and
radio receivers that sense radio signals from lightning, and a
central computer that uses the information to pinpoint the
lightning.
   The sensors will be installed at Palmer, Homer, Lake Iliamna and
Squentna, Alaska, not at the Anchorage airport itself.
   Even in good weather, the pilot of a KLM Boeing 747-400 jumbo
jet failed to detect an ash cloud from Redoubt Volcano last Dec.
15, a day after the 10,197-foot volcano started erupting for the
first time since 1968.
   The plane, traveling from Amsterdam to Tokyo via Anchorage, flew
into the cloud and all four engines stalled.
   For nine terrifying minutes, the plane and its 245 passengers
and crew members plunged in a powerless glide from 28,000 feet to
13,000 feet. The engines were restarted just in time to prevent the
jet from hitting 11,000-foot-tall mountains in the area.
   Redoubt, 110 miles southwest of Anchorage, repeatedly spewed ash
up to 40,000 feet since last December. A snow-covered lava dome in
its summit crater threatens to trigger steam eruptions and send
more ash skyward any time, Miller said.
   After the KLM jet's near-crash, a Boeing 727 and two 737s also
flew into Redoubt's ash clouds and sustained minor damage last
December and February. Three jumbo jets had close calls similar to
the KLM incident when they flew into ash clouds from Indonesian
volcanos during the 1980s.
   Thunderstorms are rare around Anchorage in winter, so there
won't be a problem of confusing storm lightning with bolts from the
volcanic clouds, Miller said.

   Golfers in Palm Beach County can tee
off at the driving range at night again, but some Boy Scouts still
can't camp under the stars as the state's worst encephalitis
outbreak since the 1960s winds down.
   Health officials have recorded 203 cases of St. Louis
encephalitis, a potentially deadly illness, in 27 central and south
Florida counties since it was first reported in mid-August. Eight
people have died.
   State health officials say the outbreak of the flu-like viral
disease will likely end with winter. Cold weather slows down and
begins to kill the night-flying mosquitos that carry the virus.
   ``I can almost guarantee you that there won't be any more
transmission by January,'' Dr. Diana Wells, the state's assistant
epidemiologist, said Wednesday.
   Camping, high school football and Halloween trick-or-treating
were some of the evening activities canceled in many areas as the
state Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services advised
residents and visitors to stay inside after dark.
   The outbreak was worse than in 1977, when 110 cases were
reported and eight people died. Officials said another severe
outbreak occurred in the late 1960s, but figures for it were not
available.
   Health officials in Tallahassee said last week that nighttime
activities could begin again, but that people going out at night
should still cover up and use mosquito repellant.
   Palm Beach County health officials lifted their medical alert
Monday.
   ``You could almost hear the sigh of relief,'' said Cam
Freedlund, a state health agency spokeswoman in West Palm Beach.
``People can go back outside on the driving range now and not worry
about it.''
   Alerts remained in effect in several other counties, but were
expected to be lifted soon, Wells said.
   In Tampa, Mark Griffin, an official with the Boy Scouts of
America, said a camping ban was still in effect for troops in eight
counties.
   Bill Toth, a spokesman for the Orange County Public Health Unit,
said activities were also being restricted there.
   Toth said his office has fielded calls from people around the
world who were concerned about visiting Florida during the
outbreak.
   ``We have accepted phone calls in this building from Australia
to Hawaii to Alaska to Canada to the United Kingdom and all points
between, questioning whether it was safe to come here,'' he said.

<HEAD>ANC Says It Is Rethinking Sanctions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   African National Congress
leader Nelson Mandela says his organization is rethinking its
support of economic sanctions but wants present measures kept in
place for the time being.
   Mandela, in a letter Thursday to European Community leaders,
called on the group to delay any new decisions on sanctions until
early next year.
   The EC leaders are to meet next week in Rome. There have been
indications some member countries may support a relaxation of the
sanctions imposed to protest apartheid.
   The ANC, South Africa's leading black opposition movement, has
been the leading proponent of comprehensive sanctions to put
pressure on the white-led government. It has repeatedly said
sanctions should be maintained until there was ``irreversible''
change toward dismantling apartheid.
   Manela said the ANC was reviewing its sanctions policy to reach
a ``position common to the majority of anti-apartheid forces in the
country.''
   The ANC is to hold a major conference Dec. 14-16, and
re-evaluating sanctions was expected to be a leading issue.
   ``It is too early to begin celebrating the lifting of
sanctions,'' said Business Day, an anti-apartheid newspaper that
opposes sanctions.
   But the ANC ``could be on the brink of moderating it
uncompromising support of sanctions,'' the newspaper said.
   Business Day reported Thursday that sports and cultural
sanctions supported by the ANC could be lifted first, followed by
economic sanctions.
   Western European nations and the United States have maintained
limited economic sanctions against South Africa in recent years.
   But the countries have praised President F.W. de Klerk's reforms
and said sanctions would eventually be lifted if he continued with
his stated plans to end aparthied.
   The government says that blacks suffer the most from the
economic hardships caused by sanctions.
   Despite economic damage from the sanctions, South Africa still
has the continent's strongest economy and its main trade partners
are Western Europe, the United States and Japan.
   South Africa also says it trades with every African country,
mostly in secret. It also has established trade links with several
East European countries that used to be leading backers of the ANC.

<HEAD>$100,000 Reward Offered After Stabbing of Daily News Truck Driver</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY McSHANE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The publisher of the strikebound Daily News
accused New York's mayor and police of ignoring evidence that
strikers conspired to destroy the newspaper with violence and
intimidation.
   The allegations by James Hoge came Thursday after a replacement
driver was beaten and stabbed about 12 hours after he was summoned
to testify before a grand jury investigating strike violence.
   ``I submit that the police need to face up to what is clearly
the reality today in this community: the gangsters are running
free, and nobody is willing to say what is really occurring,'' Hoge
said.
   ``Instead, we have public officials that are hiding behind
technical and innocuous statements - and that is not living up to
the full responsibility of officials who have sworn to uphold the
law.''
   Hoge urged Mayor David Dinkins to speak out more forcefully.
Dinkins earlier called on all parties to denounce violence and a
mayoral spokesman said police and Dinkins had responded fairly to
complaints from both sides.
   The newspaper offered a $100,000 reward for information about
the attack early Thursday in Irvington, N.J.
   Police said 15 men armed with baseball bats, bottles and a knife
attacked replacement driver Carlos Chacon, 45, of Harrison, N.J.
   He was stabbed in the buttocks and abdomen and a helper, Derrick
Foster, 27, of Newark, N.J., was cut and bruised, police said.
   Chacon was hospitalized Thursday in satisfactory condition.
Foster was treated and released.
   Police said the victims heard one attacker say: ``These people
that work for the Daily News are taking my job. I'm going to kill
you.''
   Hoge stopped short of saying the grand jury summons and the
stabbing were directly linked.
   Chacon was called as a potential witness for an investigation
into an Oct. 27 incident in which a striking Daily News driver
allegedly smashed a delivery truck's headlights and windows, Hoge
said.
   Nine of the newspaper's 10 unions have been on strike since Oct.
25.
   Union officials decried the stabbing and denied Hoge's
accusations.
   ``The highest police officials of this city have refuted these
charges. Jim Hoge repeating something over and over like a parrot
doesn't make a conspiracy,'' said Newspaper Guild head Barry
Lipton. ``This is meaningless babble from a desperate man.''

   Pop posers Rob Pilatus and Fabrice Morvan of
Milli Vanilli were stripped of their Grammy because they synched
when they should have sang. Now they face a $120 million lawsuit
for allegedly stealing music from the 1960s-era band Blood, Sweat
and Tears.
   Singer David Clayton-Thomas said in court papers filed Thursday
that the melody of ``Spinning Wheel,'' which he wrote in 1968, was
used without his permission on the Milli Vanilli album, ``Girl You
Know It's True.''
   ``This suit is about the song they didn't write on the album
they didn't sing,'' said Clayton-Thomas' lawyer, Robert Marcus.
``The words may change but the melody lingers on.''
   Pilatus and Morvan were forced to give back a Grammy they won
for best new artist after it was revealed they did not sing the
album's songs and were lip-synching the words in concerts.
   At at news conference in Manhattan, Marcus played tapes of
``Spinning Wheel'' and the Milli Vanilli song ``All or Nothing.''
The lawyer said the melody lines of the choruses are identical.
   The Milli Vanilli record does not credit Clayton-Thomas. On the
album, group producer Frank Farian and two others are credited with
writing the song.
   The suit named Pilatus, Morvan, Farian and EMI Music Publishing
Inc., which holds Clayton-Thomas' music copyrights in trust.
   EMI executive vice president Harold Rosenbloom did not
immediately return a call seeking comment.
   The whereabouts of Farian, Pilatus and Morvan were not
immediately known. A call to Arista Records, where the album was
recorded, was referred to lawyer Michael Pollock, who did not
immediately return messages.

<TEXT>
   Filipinos are stocking up on
necessities in anticipation that oil prices driven up sharply by
the Persian Gulf crisis and government subsidy cuts will spark
inflation across the board.
   The government of President Corazon Aquino this week ordered a
30 percent increase of the gas price to $2.81 a gallon. Other fuel
prices also increased, by an average of 45 percent.
   The increases announced Wednesday and Thursday are expected to
double the cost of public transport and lead to sharply higher
prices for food, electricity and other essentials.
   It now costs more to fill the tank of a mid-sized car than a
public school teacher earns in a week.
   Thousands of shoppers jammed Manila supermarkets following the
fuel hikes to stock up on canned goods, cooking oil and other basic
supplies before prices on those items go up.
   Spot checks of several markets showed prices for fish, chicken,
and pork had increased about 7 percent since the fuel price hike.
   Sen. Orlando Mercado, chairman of the Senate commerce committee,
called the increases ``an act of national suicide'' and joined Sen.
Ernesto Maceda and opposition Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile in calling for
Mrs. Aquino to resign.
   Communist rebels threatened to bomb gas stations that increase
their gas prices in the city of Cagayan de Oro, 500 miles south of
Manila.
   About 4,000 students of the Bukidnon State College, southeast of
Cagayan, staged a one day walk-out to protest the new prices.
   The government said the fuel price increase was brought on by
higher crude oil prices since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in
August. The Philippines imports most of its crude oil.
   World oil prices have fallen since the invasion. But the
government has subsidized the oil products it refines for years,
and the price increase was also due to measures included in an
austerity program pushed by the International Monetary Fund.
   Stunned by the increases, dozens of angry Filipinos have been
telephoning call-in shows on Manila radio stations to vent their
anger.
   ``Cory Aquino is like a doll - a puppet of her advisers,''
caller Loy Trinidad told radio station DZRH.
   One supermarket shopper, Ria Teves, said she had to wrestle a
can of cooking oil away from a clerk who tried to remove it from
her shopping cart to mark a higher price.
   ``I scolded her and told her off,'' Mrs. Teves said.
   At another supermarket, housewife Rosalinda Mundo said she had
planned to do the monthly shopping next week but changed her mind
after fuel prices were increased.
   ``If I wait, my budget will get me only half as much,'' she
said. ``They're trying to take the food right out of our mouths.''
   Taxi driver Exquiel Valenzuela was refusing to pick up
passengers unless they agreed in advance to pay more than the
metered fare. He said drivers could not earn enough money to buy
gasoline at the new prices and still clear a profit.
   ``The government has dug our graves for us and is just waiting
for us to jump in,'' said Valenzuela, a father of four.

noise on wind blowing over louvers on the midtown building's green,
eight-sided dome, which is about 800 feet above the ground.
   At its worst, the whistle can be heard 10 blocks away, although
its intensity depends on wind conditions, said Jerome Ross, an
environmental protection enforcement officer.
   The building's developer, Ian Bruce Eichner, has been issued a
summons for allegedly violating noise regulations, Ross said.
   If found guilty, Eichner would have to mute the whistling and
pay a fine of up to $880, Ross said.

<TEXT>
   Stanislaw Tyminski returned to Poland two
months ago presenting himself as a successful technocrat who would
use Western business acumen to reverse the nation's economic
crisis.
   But the picture that emerged of Lech Walesa's surprise
challenger in the country's first popular presidential election
turned out to be something different: a vague ideologue who has
ties to the former Communist Party, believes in ESP and threatens
political opponents with secret documents.
   ``Nobody knew the truth about Tyminski,'' said Emilia Bargiel of
Jastrzebie, saying she was ashamed to have voted for him in the
first round Nov. 25. She said she will cast her vote for Walesa in
the runoff Sunday.
   ``Finally the journalists found out - too late for many
people.''
   Tyminski's come-from-nowhere bid - which eliminated Prime
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki from the race - was so fast and
unexpected in this new democracy that some feel like they just
missed getting hit by a train.
   Now three opinion polls show Walesa with a widening lead two
days before the 27 million Polish voters make their choice.
   If the Tyminski surge has been stopped, it is because a
gradually sharper picture has emerged of the man once referred to
as a ``Polish Indiana Jones'' when he strode into the political
arena early in October.
   Labeling himself the campaign's ``only independent candidate,''
he told a rags-to-riches story.
   According to Tyminski, he left Poland in 1969 with the
equivalent of $5 in his pocket, worked as a gardener in Sweden,
emigrated to Canada where he made his first after-tax million in
computers by 1980, then removed himself to the Amazonian city of
Iquitos, Peru, to find spiritual rebirth in the jungle, returned to
Canada in 1986 and is now ready to share his knowledge with his
compatriots.
   ``Financial success put him in one of the higher places among
Canada's wealthy,'' his campaign literature boasted. In a country
where the rich uncle from America is part of the national folklore,
Tyminski's campaign soon found believers.
   He was among only six out of 14 would-be candidates able to
collect the required 100,000 nominating signatures by Oct. 25.
   His campaign meetings around the country drew the curious and
sent away the converted. High-quality color posters splashed his
clean-cut face on buses and walls.
   While Walesa and Mazowiecki were slinging mud at each other,
Tyminski said he was not a politician. But he also told voters that
Mazowiecki was guilty of treason for economic policies that had
destroyed Poland's best industries. After his election, he said,
the economy would improve in one month.
   Polls showed his support doubling week-by-week. Days before the
first round, he passed Mazowiecki, setting off alarm bells. The
prime minister's campaign, which had been gunning only at Walesa,
now turned to take aim at Tyminski. But it proved too late.
   About this time, however, contradictions began to appear in
Tyminski's statements and suspicions about his background:
   -Leaders of the Polish community in Canada said Tyminski was not
known even to fellow Polish emigres. The reported his company
employed only 14 people. And his Libertarian Party of Canada has
3,500 members and never won a seat in either a provincial or
federal parliament.
   -Tyminski for a time asserted that he had not returned to Poland
in years. Then the Interior Ministry confirmed he had been back
seven times between 1980 and 1989, arriving on visas issued by the
Polish consulate in Tripoli, Libya. Tyminski then admitted coming
back, but said he never was in Libya.
   The climax may have come at a raucous nationally televised
two-hour news conference last Saturday.
   There many Poles heard for the first time the names and ranks of
former Communists and secret police operatives who had been active
in the Tyminski campaign, that he had been married once before
outside the Catholic Church and that he claimed to have had
spiritual voyages in the Peruvian jungle.
   They also saw him coolly warn Walesa, in a style reminiscent of
the hated Security Service, that he had damaging ``personal
materials'' about the Solidarity chief in a black briefcase at his
feet.
   Since then Tyminski's campaign has been dogged by chants of
``K-G-B.''

   An earthquake strong enough to ``shake
dishes'' jolted residents of Anchorage and Palmer, but no damage
was immediately reported, a geophysicist said.
   Thursday night's quake measured 5.0 on the Richter scale and its
epicenter was in unpopulated areas, said Bob Hammond of the Alaska
Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer.
   An earthquake of 5.0 magnitude ``can shake dishes ... if you're
located right in the epicenter it could potentially crack dry
walls, things like that,'' he said.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus, a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10
times stronger than one of 6.5.
   In 1964, an Alaska quake measuring 8.4 killed 131 people.

<HEAD>Opposition, Students Demand Trial Of Ershad and Ministers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A day after their protests brought him
down, the enemies of ousted President Hussain Muhammad Ershad
demanded today that he and his ministers be tried for human rights
violations and corruption.
   Ershad was replaced by Supreme Court Chief Justice Shahabuddin
Ahmed, who will preside over an interim government until
parliamentary elections are held within 90 days.
   Political analysts doubt the interim government will initiate
any case against Ershad and his colleagues. Ahmed has only one
mandate - to conduct the elections. But the demands for
score-settling, official or otherwise, are unlikely to abate.
   A mob in Dhaka on Thursday beat to death a man they accused of
being an Ershad supporter, witnesses said.
   Otherwise, life in the capital was returning to normal after
nearly two months of almost daily protests and violence.
   Many shops opened today, on Sabbath in this overwhelmingly
Moslem nation of 110 million people. Traffic was moving normally as
barricades were taken down.
   But the opposition was doing its part to keep the political
flames burning.
   ``We definitely want a trial of those who have committed crimes
and atrocities in the past eight years,'' said opposition leader
Khaleda Zia.
   Mrs. Zia, as leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, and
Sheik Hasina, of the Awami League, joined forces in a series of
protests that brought down Ershad.
   ``Ershad and his ministers have amassed millions of dollars by
cheating the nation. The criminals must stand for trial,'' said
Amir Hossain Amu, a leader of Hasina's party.
   ``If there are complaints of corruption and misuse of power
against someone, the government should take appropriate actions in
accordance with the laws of the land,'' the army chief of staff,
Lt. Gen. Nooruddin Khan, said during a televised interview Thursday
night.
   Ershad was the army chief when he took power in a bloodless coup
in March 1982. He resigned from the army after winning presidential
elections in 1986, which the opposition claimed were rigged.
   Charges of vote fraud also dogged the 1988 parliamentary
elections, won by Ershad's Jatiya Party. The opposition made vote
fraud the focus of their protests when Ershad announced he would be
a candidate for re-election in June 1991.
   Ershad's resignation capped a dizzying reversal in his political
fortunes. The fraud claims and protests had been little more than
background noise during Ershad's eight years in office, and three
weeks ago he was confidently predicting success in next year's
election.
   But once Sheik Hasina and Khaleda Zia were able to overcome
longstanding political differences, their campaign gained new life.
It quickly spread even after Ershad declared a state of emergency
Nov. 27.
   The opposition claims at least 100 people were killed by troops
during the emergency, which was withdrawn Wednesday. The government
said only six people died.

   No evidence has been found linking a foreign
government to a former U.S. soldier indicted for allegedly plotting
to kill President Bush and other top officials, the U.S. Attorney
for New Jersey said.
   U.S. Attorney Michael Chertoff said it does not appear Jamal
Mohammed Warrayat, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Kuwait, had
outside help in the alleged plot to kill Bush, Secretary of State
James A. Baker III, unspecified members of Congress and to attack
military installations in three states.
   Warrayat, 32, was indicted Thursday on three felony charges. He
could be sentenced to 15 years and fined $750,000 if convicted of
all counts.
   Warrayat has been held without bail since his Nov. 27 arrest. An
arraignment is expected within two weeks.
   Court papers said Warrayat wanted to kill the officials because
they were against the interests of his group, but the papers did
not describe the group or its interests further, and prosecutors
would not elaborate.
   According to the court papers, Warrayat told an undercover FBI
agent that his group was ready to attack Bush and the others, as
well as attack unspecified military installations in North
Carolina, Texas and Kansas. He allegedly said the group was looking
for help obtaining explosives, money and technical training.
   Warrayat's attorney, Terence Scott, was not available for
comment Thursday, his secretary said.
   Scott has previously said Warrayat was born in Kuwait, came to
the United States in the early 1970s and served about four years in
the Army until 1979.
   Scott said that until recently his client worked as a taxi
driver but was unemployed at the time of his arrest.

   The judge who set bail at $300,000 for the
alleged killer of Rabbi Meir Kahane suspended it a day later, and
the district attorney said the original motion granting bail was
made over his objections.
   State Supreme Court Justice Alvin Schlesinger, who approved the
$300,000 bail for El Sayyid Nosair on Wednesday, suspended it on
Thursday and scheduled a new bail hearing for Monday.
   District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said Thursday that his
office had requested Nosair be held without bail.
   ``We pointed out to the court that he is accused of committing a
number of exceptionally serious crimes, including both the murder
of Rabbi Kahane and the wounding of a federal police officer,''
Morgenthau said.
   Nosair, 35, of Cliffside Park, N.J., is accused of shooting the
Zionist activist last month as Kahane finished a speech at a New
York City hotel. He also is accused of wounding two other men as he
fled.
   One of the two, a postal service police officer, wounded Nosair.
   In a statement to police, attached to a disclosure form filed in
court, Nosair told police Kahane was actually shot by another
person and that he was framed. He said he went to hear Kahane's
lecture because he agreed with much of the rabbi's philosophy.

<TEXT>
   Given Saddam Hussein's record, the Bush
administration is offering a subdued response to Baghdad's surprise
announcement that all 900 Americans held in Iraq and Kuwait will be
freed.
   The hostages' release is one of the three principal U.S. demands
made of the Iraqi president since his lightning takeover of Kuwait
in August. President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III
still insist on fulfillment of the other two - a total withdrawal
and restoration of the overthrown Kuwaiti government.
   Freeing the hostages, including 88 held as human shields at
strategic locations, could serve Saddam's purposes by contributing
to the rising opposition among Congress and the public to a use of
military force.
   With the Iraqi leader capitulating to one demand, why not wait
for the worldwide trade embargo and other economic sanctions to
squeeze Saddam into giving up Kuwait?
   But before that argument can get very far, the American hostages
have to be freed. And they are not out yet.
   The State Department, through broadcasts on the Voice of
America, advised the Americans to remain where they were until
arrangements are made for their rescue.
   The Iraqi ambassador, Mohamed Sadiq Al-Mashat, said he expected
the release within days.
   In a televised interview today, he said Iraqi officials are
arranging for flights and exit visas for the hostages.
   ``We are speeding the process of their departure,'' Al-Mashat
said on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.''
   The envoy said Iraq was willing to release the hostages because
``there is more hope for peace'' and because of planned talks with
U.S. officials. He said Iraq was expecting ``absolutely nothing''
in return.
   An additional 2,250 U.S. citizens and foreign-born family
members have been allowed to leave since the takeover of Kuwait, so
it may simply be a matter of making arrangements over a few days
before the 900 are liberated.
   And yet, the hostages are an extremely valuable bargaining chip,
especially those being used as human shields to deter U.S. attack.
   Administration officials have denounced their detention - and
the sporadic release of other Americans - as a cruel manipulation
of people and their families.
   Bush has said many times that in deciding whether to attack Iraq
or take other actions to liberate Kuwait, he would not be held
hostage to Saddam's hostage policy.
   Even so, it would be difficult to imagine the president ordering
an assault on an installation where Americans were held prisoner.
   Throughout the five-month crisis U.S. hopes have been boosted
and dashed by various statements from Iraq.
   Early on, there were pledges to leave Kuwait if the United
States promised not to attack, but Kuwait remains under Iraqi
occupation.
   U.S. diplomats eager to visit American hostages were told it was
only a matter of making proper arrangements. But they applied and
were denied access anyway.
   ``Mercurial'' is a cliched adjective commonly applied to Saddam.
Another is ``unpredictable.''
   He fought a bloody war with Iran for eight years and then
suddenly relinquished all his territorial gains and agreed to a
cease-fire.
   Saddam appeared to be moderating his policies, inducing the
Reagan and Bush administrations to be a little friendlier. And
then, with dramatic suddenness, came the Aug. 2 blitzkrieg invasion
of Kuwait.
   Bush welcomed the announcement Thursday that the hostages would
be released. But he said the United States must not let its war
footing in the Persian Gulf slip. ``We've got to continue to keep
the pressure on,'' he said while traveling in South America.
   Hopeful but cautious, Bush also cited the easing of Iraq's
pressure on the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait and said: ``It seems to be a
little movement here, a little movement there.''
   But the president and others in the administration are not
cheering yet.

   U.S. military personnel who are stationed in
the Persian Gulf area on the April 15 tax-filing deadline will have
an an extra 60 days to file their 1990 federal tax returns.
   In announcing the automatic extension, the Internal Revenue
Service said Thursday that interest will be charged as usual on any
tax not paid by the regular deadline. The agency said it has no
authority under the law to waive that requirement.
   The IRS noted, however, that most military personnel will be due
a refund and so would not face the interest charge. The agency said
it will work closely with the Defense Department in providing
tax-return assistance to members of the armed forces.
   The IRS left open the possibility that a further filing
extension would be granted if conditions warrant.

<TEXT>
   Federal officials attempted to calm
worried residents evacuated from flood-ravaged housing that tests
showing the presence of high levels of cancer-causing PCBs don't
necessarily mean they are in danger.
   Milton Clark, a PCB specialist with the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, told residents attending a public meeting that
while long-term exposure may be harmful, brief exposure poses
little hazard.
   ``In the short term, you're not at risk,'' he said Thursday.
   The residents of about 120 homes were barred from returning to
their houses after the PCBs were found Wednesday.
   Residents in the 270-home Wicker Park subdivision had begun
returning Monday to gather personal items from homes damaged last
week when 6 inches of rain caused flooding.
   Test results shared by the EPA led the state to declare the
houses off-limits. The EPA said it found double the acceptable
levels of PCBs.
   Tests for PCBs were conducted after Highland officials reported
seeing a sheen on floodwaters.
   The cause of the contamination had not been determined.
   Jim Lynch, a spokesman for the Indiana Department of
Environmental Management, told reporters that officials were
researching the history of the area. He said there were indications
the neighborhood had been a ``dumping area,'' but did not
elaborate.
   PCBs, once commonly used as insulation in electrical
transformers, were banned by the federal government as a
cancer-causing substance in the 1970s.
   Residents of Wicker Park Estates in Highland and other areas hit
hard by flooding last week did get some good news Thursday when
President Bush declared Lake County a disaster area.
   The disaster declaration will enable Lake County's flood victims
to get low-interest loans and other assistance on a case-by-case
basis.

<TEXT>
   A woman seeking guardianship of her
brain-damaged lesbian lover says she would never keep her from
seeing her estranged parents.
   Karen Thompson, a professor at St. Cloud State University, said
Sharon Kowalski, 34, has already suffered enough after a 1983
traffic accident left her without the use of her limbs and barely
able to speak.
   ``I never want to put her in the position that she has to choose
between her biological family and chosen family,'' Thompson told
St. Louis County District Judge Robert Campbell on Thursday.
   The hearing, scheduled to end today, is expected to cap a
five-year guardianship struggle that has pitted Thompson against
Kowalski's parents. Don and Della Kowalski of Nashwauk have since
said they lack the energy and the money to keep fighting for their
daughter, whom they sequestered from Thompson for 3{ years.
   Since last year, she has been cared for at a nursing home in
suburban Robbinsdakem, pending Ms. Thompson's petition.
   The dispute has been followed closely by gay rights advocates
who maintain Thompson is best suited to care for Kowalski. The two
lived together for four years before the accident, Thompson said,
and considered themselves secretly married.
   A physician said Thursday that Kowalski's emotional and physical
well-being are on the line if Thompson is barred from becoming her
guardian.
   ``Sharon communicates with Karen in a way no one else does,''
said Dr. Gail Gregor, a rehabilitation consultant. ``Karen is the
key to her past self and the window into who she is now. ... She
chooses not to interact unless Karen is with her.''
   On the subject of Kowalski's parents, Gregor said they have had
such infrequent contact with their daughter since they gave up
guardianship that it may make little difference if they never see
her again.

<TEXT>
   After a white mob cornered and fatally shot a
black teen-ager, prosecuters had counted on John Vento to talk. He
was part of that gang and agreed to be a witness in exchange for
immunity.
   But he backed out of the deal and fled the city before
ultimately deciding to surrender and face trial rather than testify
against pals from Bensonhurst, the predominantly white Brooklyn
neighborhood where the black teen was killed.
   Prosecutors called Vento's move a double-cross and said his
change of heart hurt the cases against other defendants. Two were
cleared this week on all major charges.
   On Thursday, Vento, 22, was acquitted of murder and manslaughter
in the August 1989 slaying of 16-year-old Yusuf Hawkins. Vento was
convicted of riot. ''Yes, yes, yes!'' he bellowed, slamming his
hands on the defense table as the verdict was read. Crying and
screaming, he grabbed and hugged his lawyer before he was
restrained by court officers.
   The riot conviction carries a maximum term of one and one-third
years to four years in prison, which could run concurrently or be
added to a longer term he received from prior convictions in the
case.
   Reached by telephone, juror Gay Fallows said: ``All I will tell
you is, it was a very, very difficult case and very difficult
decision.''
   The trial was the second for Vento. In July, a jury convicted
him of unlawful imprisonment and menacing, but acquitted him of the
most serious charge he faced, intentional murder.
   ``It's always hard to convict someone when he was not the
trigger man,'' prosecutor Paul Burns said.
   Prosecutors were able to retry Vento because the jury deadlocked
on two of the charges in July, and a few weeks later, a grand jury
added a second-degree manslaughter count.
   He is serving a sentence of two and two-thirds to eight years in
prison for the first two convictions.
  JJoseph Fama, convicted of murder and other crimes, is serving 32
and two-thirds years to life. Keith Mondello, the organizer of the
mob, was acquitted of murder and manslaughter, but was sentenced to
up to 16 years in prison for convictions of other crimes.
   Three other defendants are scheduled to stand trial early next
year.

   Smoke from an electrical room fire triggered
alarms at the luxury Mirage Hotel, prompting dozens of guests to
evacuate. There were no injuries.
   Guests, many clad in pajamas, fled the second and third floors
of the west wing of the 30-story hotel Thursday night as smoke
drifted through hallways. The cause of the fire was under
investigation.
   About 35 Clark County firefighters extinguished the blaze at
9:30 p.m., 45 minutes after it began. The fire was confined by
sprinklers to the power room on the mezzanine level, said hotel
Chairman Steve Wynn.
   Smoke was reported up to the 18th floor, and water flooded small
meeting rooms.
   ``There was a ton of smoke,'' Wynn said. ``The damage was
contained. The damage is going to be water - a few thousand
dollars.''
   The $630 million casino hotel opened Nov. 22, 1989, and is owned
by Golden Nugget Inc.

   After a day of mild weather, storm systems are bringing rain and
snow to much of the country, although the West is basking under
clear skies.
   A cold front stretching along the East Coast will bring heavy
thunderstorms to the Southeast and South tonight and Saturday and
snow to the Appalachians, forecasters said.
   Cloudy weather prevailed in much of New York state and New
England early today. Temperatures were to reach the 40s, with lows
in the 20s and 30s.
   Cloudy skies also prevailed in the Midwest, with increasing
clouds expected Saturday.
   Most of Iowa, Wisconsin, eastern Nebraska, southeast Minnesota
and northwest Illinois remained covered with snow today. Low
temperatures tonight will be in the 20s and 30s.
   A cold front will also bring more snow to the western Great
Lakes region.
   Clear skies prevailed in much of the West, from Texas west to
California, with temperatures in the 60s, 70s and 80s, although
temperatures in mountain areas were much cooler.
   There were scattered showers today in the Pacific Northwest,
with high temperatures forecast in the 50s.
   San Juan Capistrano, Calif., was the hot spot in the nation
Thursday, with an afternoon high of 88 degrees.

<TEXT>
   Crews expected to finish transferring 35
million gallons of Alaska crude oil from a damaged tanker to
another ship by tonight as long as seas remained calm, the Coast
Guard said.
   The transfer from the 815-foot Keystone Canyon, which had a
cracked ballast tank, to the 669-foot Kenai about 150 miles west of
San Francisco began Thursday afternoon.
   No oil had spilled from the tanker, but the transfer was
necessary because the 20-foot vertical crack in a starboard ballast
tank in the midsection compromised the ship's stability, said
Quartermaster Dennis Krumel. No oil was in the ballast tank, which
is filled at varying levels with water.
   Crews had planned to start moving the oil by Wednesday evening
but were delayed by 15-foot ocean swells, Coast Guard Commander
Scot Tiernan said. The transfer finally began Thursday in calmer
seas with 10- to 12-foot waves and wind about 10 mph, the Coast
Guard said.
   The ship-to-ship transfer was a ``reasonably rare'' occurrence,
said Tiernan, chief of port operations at the Marine Safety Office
in San Francisco.
   ``In general, you don't offload 120 miles offshore,'' he said.
``It shouldn't be a big deal, but they're taking all the
precautions they can.''
   Crews, unloading up to 35,000 barrels an hour, expected the
transfer to take 30 hours.
   The Kenai's capacity, 835,000 barrels or 35 million gallons, is
about 15,000 barrels smaller than the Keystone Canyon, and all but
that amount will be transferred, Tiernan said. The Kenai will take
the cargo to refineries in El Segundo, Calif., he said.
   The Keystone Canyon is owned by the Connecticut National Bank of
Hartford, Conn., and operated by the Philadelphia-based Keystone
Shipping Co. The crude oil load is owned by BP Oil.

<TEXT>
   Relatives of about 900 American hostages were waiting today for
Iraq's Saddam Hussein to follow through on his promise to release
all ``foreign guests'' in time for Christmas.
   ``All we can do now is live in the hope that he really is coming
home,'' said Shirley Carroll of Augusta, Ga., whose husband is
among holdouts at the U.S. Embssy in Kuwait.
   ``It's more or less a wait-and-see game,'' said Elsie Lucille
Hughes of Albuquerque, N.M., whose husband and son are hiding in
Kuwait. ``We're waiting to see ... whether it's got conditions
attached to it or not.''
   Family and friends of American captives were elated by the Iraqi
president's turnaround, but they were also wary of tricks. For
those with loved ones in hiding, such a prospect was especially
fearsome.
   ``If you take (Saddam) at face value, then they're going to be
released,'' said attorney David McDonald Jr., whose client and
friend is among those in hiding. ``The question then becomes when?
Is this a ploy to draw everyone out?''
   Doubts aside, the promise brought new hope to families.
   ``We've been waiting and waiting, trying and trying to get him
out and hitting brick walls,'' said Sue Iliff, whose brother is
among holdouts at the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait. ``So this first ray
of hope is like a gift.''
   Saddam called for the release of all hostages in a directive
approved overwhelmingly today by the Iraqi parliament. The
government said foreigners could start applying for exit visas
immediately.
   ``We're really emotional about this because Christmas is a big
holiday with our family ... a very special time of year,'' Mrs.
Iliff said from Stover, Mo. ``But we're being careful.''
   Marie Butcher spoke with her son-in-law, Guy Seago, Thursday by
telephone from the military installation where he has been held by
Iraqi troops.
   ``He's packed and ready to leave. I warned him it might take
some time to get out ... but he's still just so thrilled,'' Mrs.
Butcher said from Johnson City, Tenn. ``We've got all our Christmas
presents wrapped and ready.''
   Marjorie Walterscheid received a similar call from her husband,
Rainard Walterscheid, one of a group of American oil workers taken
off their rigs and into custody by Iraqi troops.
   ``He said, `I'm ready to come home ... I'm really, you know, I'm
really tired. I just want to get home. Get back to work,''' she
said from Jacksboro, Texas. ``And I said, `Well maybe we'd go on a
honeymoon or something.' He just kind of laughed.''

   The Iraqi parliament on Friday overwhelmingly endorsed Saddam
Hussein's decision to free thousands of Western hostages, meaning
the 900 Americans held captive in Iraq and Kuwait might be home for
Christmas. The more than 8,000 Westerners, East Europeans and
Japanese stranded in Iraq will be allowed to leave beginning
Saturday, Iraqi officials said. The captives will be flown out on
special Iraqi Airways flights to Amman, Jordan, the officials said.

   U.S. officials said Iraq has sent 30,000 more troops to the
Arabian desert in recent days, indicating Baghdad has no intention
of abandoning Kuwait. Pentagon spokesman Bob Hall said on Thursday
the troop reinforcements brought the Iraqi buildup in Kuwait and
southern Iraq to 480,000 soldiers.

   President Bush, touring South America, dismissed a U.N. proposal
circulating Thursday for a Middle East peace conference, renewing
his rejection of Saddam's attempt to link resolution of the crisis
with the Arab-Israeli conflict. U.N. Security Council ambassadors
discussed a draft resolution that approves a world conference on
the Palestinian problem.

   Defense Ministry sources in Cairo said on Friday that Egypt will
increase its military forces in Saudi Arabia and in the United Arab
Emirates this month, bringing the total to 27,000 men. They said
the 7,000 new troops will begin moving to Saudi Arabia in the
coming week. Egypt and Saudi Arabia have led Arab opposition to
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.

   A man accused of steering his
radio-controlled model airplane in a kamikaze-style dive that
punched a hole in a Goodyear blimp has been ordered to stand trial.
   The blimp Columbia was carrying six passengers when it sustained
the damage on Sept. 30.
   Compton Municipal Judge Morris B. Jones on Thursday ordered John
William Moyer, 28, to trial on charges of assault with intent to
commit great bodily injury, vandalism and damage to an aircraft.
   Jones scheduled the trial Dec. 20 in Superior Court.
   Prosecutors say Moyer's plane ripped a square-foot hole in
Columbia's fabric skin, allowing non-flammable helium gas to leak
out. Veteran pilot Nick Nicolary guided the 192-foot airship to a
safe landing in Carson.
   Moyer claims he lost control of the plane, which he was flying
in a vacant lot frequented by radio-controlled airplane buffs.

<TEXT>
   NATO defense ministers agreed in
principle today on a post-Cold War defense strategy of reduced U.S.
presence in Europe, smaller forces and a continued mix of
conventional and nuclear arms.
   ``Our future force posture will be based on smaller, more mobile
and flexible active forces, able to respond to aggression from any
quarter,'' the ministers said in a communique.
   They said the Persian Gulf crisis served as an example of
``continuing risks of aggression'' from outside NATO territory that
have a bearing on the vital security interests of the allies.
   The NATO allies pledged to maintain military and other pressures
to force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.
   The gulf crisis ``presents a fundamental challenge to the vision
of a peaceful world order,'' the ministers said.
   The communique said a draft resolution on NATO's future was
discussed during the two-day meeting at NATO headquarters in
Brussels and would be adopted next year.
   ``Nuclear weapons ... play a key role in the prevention of war
and the maintenance of stability,'' the communique said. It
restated NATO's desire for U.S.-Soviet negotiations on reducing
short-range nuclear missiles in Europe.
   U.S.-Soviet negotiations begin next year on reducing short-range
missiles, which have a range of up to 310 miles.
   NATO chief Manfred Woerner and U.S. Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney said the allies remain committed to reduce NATO's
short-range nuclear arsenal - free-fall bombs, ground-launched
Lance missiles and artillery - through negotiations with Moscow.
   German Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said earlier he saw
a consensus emerging that the allies were ready to remove all of
these arms. NATO has said it will not modernize the Lance missiles
and nuclear artillery but deployment of a new tactical
air-to-surface missile remains under study.
   Cheney said on Thursday that the threat of a massive Warsaw Pact
invasion had been replaced by new dangers for the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization.
   These include lingering threats from the Soviet Union, potential
instability in Eastern Europe, the spread of chemical arms and
ballistic missiles in the Middle East and possible threats to
energy supplies, he said.
   Officials said the new strategy - to be finalized early next
year - will provide for a continued presence of nuclear arms in
Europe, albeit in greatly reduced numbers.
   On the gulf crisis, Cheney and British Defense Secretary Tom
King asked their allies for more help in moving troops and
equipment to the Middle East.
   Cheney said he asked the allies for more help in providing ships
and planes for transport of U.S. troops to the gulf. He said he
also asked for additional ``heavy combat'' and air defense forces
to help push Iraq out of Kuwait. He reported a ``generally
favorable response'' but no specific pledges of help.
   He added that Saddam's decision to free all foreign hostages
altered neither American deployment plans nor its insistence that
Iraq withdraw.
   ``The only acceptable outcome is for Saddam Hussein to withdraw
all his forces from Kuwait and to allow the restoration of the
legitimate government of Kuwait,'' he said.
   The allies reiterated their readiness to go to war unless Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein pulls his forces out of Kuwait by Jan. 15
as required by a Nov. 29 United Nations resolution.
   The United States has about 250,000 troops in the gulf region,
and plans to increase its force to more than 400,000.
   Britain, with the second-largest foreign army in the area, plans
to bring its force to over 30,000 in the next few weeks.

   Hordes of Roman Catholic faithful are
flocking to see an image on the wall of a church in California that
many believe depicts the Virgin Mary.
   ``I think it's a miracle,'' said Marie Cammarota, 60, of
Sacramento after filing through St. Dominic's Church on Thursday.
   She waited with about 5,000 others in a line that extended a
quarter-mile at its peak and turned the chief of the small police
force into a traffic cop. Competition for parking in the Sierra
Nevada town of 1,000 was fierce. A Christmas tree lot next door
charged $5 per car.
   Church representatives said a few people slept overnight in the
church parking lot to be near the front of the line that begins
taking shape more than two hours before the hourlong appearance of
the image, starting at 9:30 a.m.
   Some visitors took the day off from work and parents kept their
children out of school to witness the image.
   Many prayed as they passed through the 250-seat church. Some
wept.
   Staring at the image, the seated congregation - the first 250 in
line in this case - recited the rosary, which includes the phrase,
``Holy Mary, mother of God.''
   Some weren't so sure it was a miracle. ``It was weird. I think
it's what you want it to be. If you're into religion, then you see
the Virgin Mary,'' said Tyler Palacio, 13.
   The Rev. Patrick Joseph of Chicago, who was among those who have
traveled the farthest, said he thought the miracle was outside the
church, among the faithful.
   ``People aren't coming together because they are sure it is a
miracle,'' he said. ``They're coming here to pray that it might
be.''
   Everyone agreed they had seen something. It started as faint,
curved lines of mostly red, blue, green, purple and pink light. The
lines darkened and extended into a shape that looked like the top
half of a figure. Then it gradually faded away.
   Some of the lines were sharp, others fuzzy, leading some
observers to describe the image as forming on the wall and others
to say it stood out from the wall like a holograph.
   The image appears above a statue of Jesus on a wall that faces
the sun. Therefore, the image cannot be directly cast by sunlight
filtering through a stained-glass window.
   But a light fixture hanging from the roof is possibly in
position to reflect the colored light coming through the window
back onto the wall.
   The reflection theory was discounted by those who said the image
has appeared on cloudy days.
   Bishop Francis Quinn of the Sacramento Diocese, which includes
the town about 45 miles east of Sacramento, said if the image
continues he will establish a commission to investigate.
   Police Chief Bill Mintline said the effects of the crowd are
brief because most visitors leave shortly after the image fades at
about 10:30 a.m. And those who come, don't cause any trouble, he
said.
   ``It's not like a rock concert crowd,'' Mintline said.
   St. Dominic's refuses to commercialize the apparition.
   ``The church is trying not to capitalize on this. We're not
accepting any donations,'' said Bernie Molloy, a volunteer helping
his father, Ed, the church administrator.

<HEAD>Eight Blacks Killed in Township Violence, Gunmen Fire Into Homes</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-South Africa-ANC</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight blacks died in township
violence around Johannesburg, including three men killed when shots
were fired into their homes, police said today.
   Unidentified gunmen, believed to be using AK-47 rifles, fired
through the doors of homes, killing the three men in Evaton, south
of Johannesburg, police said. Seven people also were injured in
overnight clashes.
   Police reported today that five hacked and stabbed bodies were
found in the Bekkersdal township west of Johannesburg, the site of
sporadic clashes in recent months.
   Also, a man was stabbed to death in eastern Natal Province,
police added.
   Fighting between black factions linked to the African National
Congress and the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party has killed about
5,000 people in Natal in the past five years. It spread to
Johannesburg-area townships in August, and about 1,000 people have
died.
   Meanwhile, a race relations group said attacks on black
policemen and black township councilors occurred an average of
twice daily and killed 28 people from January through July.
   Many blacks consider black policemen and township leaders to be
collabrators with the white-led government and the apartheid
system of racial segregation. Under apartheid, blacks live in
segregated areas that lack the amenities and services of white
areas.
   The independent South African Institute of Race Relations said
the 409 incidents it counted in the seven-month period included 309
attacks on homes of black policemen and town council members,
usually with firebombs or other forms of arson.
   More than 400 town councilors resigned, most of them citing
intimidation by township residents, the group said Thursday. It
also said Johannesburg's English-language newspapers neglected to
report the nature of the attacks.
   ``Many articles said `pressure' caused the councilors to
resign,'' the group said. ``Quite a number failed to mention that
this pressure has frequently been so violent that the term
`pressure' is a euphemism.''
   The group said six black policemen and 22 councilors had been
killed in the attacks. It cited the killing of one councilor by the
necklace method, in which the victim has a tire placed around the
neck, gets doused in gasoline and set on fire.

<HEAD>Actor Corey Feldman Arrested Again - This Time for Unpaid Tickets</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Corey Feldman has been arrested, again. The
actor was nabbed for money owed on traffic tickets and fines,
police said today.
   The 19-year-old actor, who appeared in ``The Lost Boys,''
``Gremlins'' and ``Stand By Me,'' was released this morning after
paying $528 in outstanding tickets and fines, said Sgt. Pat Findley
of the Los Angeles Police Department's Hollywood division.
   He was to appear in Los Angeles Traffic Court on Jan. 2, the
sergeant said.
   Feldman was arrested Thursday night when officers spotted his
1989 BMW blocking a driveway and discovered there was an
outstanding traffic warrant for his arrest, Findley said.
   Officers also allegedly determined that Feldman had a suspended
driver's license, Findley said.
   It was Feldman's third arrest this year. He was taken into
custody March 9 during a traffic stop when officers allegedly found
balloons containing heroin and cocaine in his car.
   Feldman was also arrested Sept. 20 in connection with unpaid
traffic tickets. Officers allegedly found a small amount of heroin
on him during a search at a North Hollywood police station and the
actor underwent drug treatment.

   The former prime minister will remain in the House of Commons

   ``I have done pretty well out of being Mrs. Thatcher.''
   Her successor, Prime Minister John Major, recommendeded her
husband for a baronetcy, Major's Downing Street office said.
   The baronetcy, the first created since 1964, is hereditary and
Mark Thatcher will take the title when his father dies.
   Mrs. Thatcher said through a spokeswoman that she was
``delighted and thrilled with the honor conferred on her husband
who has given such tremendous support to her and been very active
in the life of the country, especially over the last 11 years.''
   Mrs. Thatcher, 65, resigned Nov. 22 after 11{ years as prime
minister.
   The Order of Merit, founded in 1902, outranks all other royal
honors and is a personal gift of the queen. Only the monarch and 24
others can be members of the order at one time. Mrs. Thatcher takes
the vacancy caused by the death of Lord Olivier last year.
   Other members include Mother Teresa of Calcutta, musician Yehudi
Menuhin and novelist Graham Greene.
   Former members include former President Dwight D. Eisenhower and
former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill.

   American soldiers had a message
for Saddam Hussein today: It's great the hostages may be home for
Christmas, but the GIs aren't going home until Kuwait is free.
   Air Force Staff Sgt. Chester Smolarczyk, who said Iraq appears
to be stalling for time but stumbling toward peace, said he's
willing to wait.
   ``Which is cheaper, blood or oil?'' asked the 28-year-old
Polish-born cargo handler from Jacksonville, Ark.
   News of Saddam's surprise promise to free the hostages was only
filtering into Saudi Arabia this morning.
   From the newest arrivals to soldiers who've been in the desert
for nearly four months, there was a feeling that something was
happening that might affect them, but they weren't sure exactly
what it was nor did they trust Saddam.
   ``He's saying it, but whether he does it or not is a different
thing. You can never trust a guy like that,'' said Air Force Sgt.
David Klunker, 25, of Salt Lake City, who was playing backgammon
during a break from unloading cargo at an air base.
   Saddam's announcement came as advance parties and the first
combat units of the 200,000 U.S. reinforcements for Operation
Desert Shield were arriving in Saudi Arabia. They will give the
240,000 troops already in place enough strength for an offensive
against Saddam if he refuses to pull out of Kuwait.
   ``If he didn't want to back down, he wouldn't be freeing the
hostages so quick,'' said Air Force Staff Sgt. William Briggs, 52,
of Columbia, S.C., whose 169th Service Battalion in the National
Guard was mobilized for the buildup.
   ``One way or the other, he is going to give in because we'll see
to that,'' he said. ``Then again, everything will be determined
Jan. 15.''
   A U.N. resolution set a Jan. 15 deadline for Saddam to pull out
of Kuwait without facing the possibility of military action by the
U.S.-led multinational force which includes 100,000 other troops
from about 25 other countries.
   First Sgt. Jerry Carlton, 37, of Warsaw, N.C., whose 82nd
Airborne unit landed in Saudi Arabia on Aug. 9, said the hostage
release could signal that Saddam was caving in or trying ``to buy
additional time.''
   ``I think it's great they're going home,'' said 1st Lt. Brian
Ratchford, 26, of Spartanburg, S.C., from the 39th Tactical Air
Squadron. ``But it's not about the hostages. I think the hostages
were a bad side effect of this whole thing,''

   A teen-ager who was at the wheel of the the
car when two ``skinhead'' friends picked a black person at random
and killed him was sentenced to 15 years in prison for her role in
the 1988 murder.
   Angela Stanley, 18, sat motionless through most of Thursday's
90-minute hearing, but wept quietly as Washoe District Judge Brent
Adams handed down the sentence.
   Stanley pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in the Dec. 10,
1988, shooting of Tony Montgomery, 27, in his sister's front yard.
   She had testified against her two passengers, avowed racist
``skinheads'' Matthew Faessel, 19, and Michael Stringer, 18.
Faessel and Stringer were convicted of first-degree murder and face
two consecutive life prison terms at their sentencing Dec. 20.
   Trial testimony showed that Stringer rolled down the window of
the car Stanley was driving, and Faessel fired the fatal shot.
   ``In my view, Angela Stanley was the least culpable of the
three,'' said Assistant District Attorney Ed Basl.
   Witnesses said the three white teen-agers became enraged at a
party attended by skinheads when a woman told them she had been
raped by a black man.
   At her hearing, Stanley denied having the white supremacist,
neo-Nazi beliefs some skinheads have embraced in recent years.
   Basl said Stanley has made substantial progress toward changing
her life but urged the court to impose a long enough sentence to
ensure a prolonged supervised parole.
   Stanley, who has already served two years in custody, will be
eligible for parole in three years.
   Her lawyer, Fred Pinkerton, said that at the time of the murder,
Stanley was a ``16-year-old street kid who sought the affections of
those who were not good.''

<HEAD>Attorneys Argue Fairness Of Buchwald's Deal With Paramount</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Art Buchwald's suit against Paramount
Pictures entered its second phase with the humorist's attorneys
arguing the studio gave him a ``raw deal.''
   The Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist won the first part of the
case when Superior Court Judge Harvey Schneider ruled the 1986
Eddie Murphy blockbuster ``Coming to America'' was based on a
Buchwald work titled ``King for a Day.''
   Thursday's proceeding was to determine the fairness of the
contract Buchwald and Bernheim signed with Paramount in 1983.
   Schneider must determine the amount of money Buchwald and his
partner, producer Alain Bernheim, should receive in the case during
a third phase of the trial.
   The blockbuster film grossed more than $300 million in box
office receipts, but Paramount says it still hasn't earned a profit
and is actually $18 million in the red. Therefore, the company
argues, Buchwald and Bernheim's share of the profits amounts to
nothing.
   Buchwald attorney Pierce O'Donnell told Schneider the contract
showed how Hollywood's net-profit agreements are unfair.
   ``Paramount says a deal is a deal, we say (Buchwald and
Bernheim) got a raw deal,'' O'Donnell said.
   Net-profit agreements grant individuals a share of a film's net
profits after the motion picture company recovers its costs and an
agreed-upon rate of return. Critics say that the arrangements can
result in unfairness if the studio artificially inflates the cost
of a film and thus reduces or eliminates the profit.
   Paramount attorney Charles Diamond said the studio was to
receive approximately 1.75 times its costs before sharing profits
from ``Coming to America.'' Paramount has not disclosed the cost of
making the film.
   Buchwald and Bernheim were to receive a combined $265,000 and up
to 40 percent of net profits under the contract.
   In court papers, Buchwald and Bernheim contended their share of
the movie's profits should be between $6.9 million and $14.6
million.
   ``We don't have to pay these gentlemen until we have recouped
all our costs from the revenue,'' Diamond said.
   ``Courts in this country ought not to be remaking deals for
parties,'' Diamond said.
   Buchwald, who attended Thursday's session, said he was
pessimistic about the outcome of the suit.
   ``I'm always prepared for the worst,'' he said. ``I can't
believe I'll win.''

<HEAD>Some Former Political Prisoners to Get Advance Compensation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some former political prisoners,
already rehabilitated but waiting for financial compensation, will
get an advance payment of $417 before Christmas, a Finance Ministry
official said today.
   However, the measure will only apply to those rehabilitated in
the Czech lands, not in Slovakia, he added.
   Under a law enacted earlier this year, former political
prisoners are entitled to about $100 for each month spent in jail
and to compensation payments for impaired health and legal costs
incurred.
   The federal government has earmarked millions of dollars for
cash payments to be made to former political prisoners and millions
of dollars to be set aside in bonds.
   ``The list of those who applied for the advance payment includes
some 1,400 people,'' said Hynek Rasocha of the Czech Finance
Ministry.
   ``It is a good thing, because many of them are very old and
poor,'' he said, indicating that some of them may not live long
enough to be able to collect their full financial compensation.
   Indemnification of former political prisoners falls under the
jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice, which does not have
sufficient personnel for the swift processing of applications.
   Some 70,000 people unjustly sentenced in political trials in
over four decades of Communist rule have been rehabilitated already
in the Czech lands and 20,000 in Slovakia. Only 430 of them have
received financial compensation.

   World leaders welcomed Iraq's decision today to
free all foreign hostages but demanded it take the next step and
withdraw from Kuwait.
   Only Iran and the PLO failed to temper their applause by urging
Iraq to undo the damage done by its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   European stock and oil markets were quiet following the Iraqi
parliament's approval today of Saddam Hussein's decision. Dealers
said the markets had already reacted to the Iraqi president's
announcement Thursday and noted the parliament has never vetoed one
of his recommendations.
   British Prime Minister John Major said: ``Saddam Hussein has a
lot more to do in terms of U.N. Security Council resolutions and
the international community will require him to do it all.''
   The whole world believes that Saddam should ``disgorge Kuwait,
release hostages and make reparations for what he has done,'' Major
told BBC radio.
   President Bush also said Saddam's announcement ``would be
welcome if true, but it will not change my thinking on his need to
comply 100 percent, without condition, to the U.N. resolutions''
that demand an Iraqi pull out from Kuwait. Bush spoke in Chile, one
stop on his South American tour.
   Last week, the U.N. Security Council authorized the use of force
against Iraq after Jan. 15 if a pullout does not occur.
   An estimated 900 Americans and 1,300 Britons are among the more
than 3,000 Westerners still in Iraq and Iraqi-occupied Kuwait.
Iraqi officials said the foreigners could begin leaving Saturday.
   Nearly 250 Soviets freed from Iraq arrived aboard an Aeroflot
jetliner in Moscow today. Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Vitaly
Churkin welcomed the release and Saddam's promise Thursday.
   The decision ``helps eliminate one of the burning issues that
arose as a result of the gulf conflict,'' Churkin said. But he
hoped ``the Iraqi leadership will take futher steps toward ... the
implementation of all provisions of the U.N. Security Council's
resolutions.''
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, speaking in London, said
Iraq should not be rewarded for releasing hostages.
   ``The taking of hostages was an outrageous act of a dictatorial
power and now he (Saddam) is maybe going to release them and he
wants to be paid for it,'' Shamir told BBC radio.
   In Oslo, Norwegian Foreign Minister Thorvald Stoltenberg said
the release ``is an acknowledgement that taking of hostages does
not aid the solving of conflicts.''
   Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, speaking in Paris,
welcomed the release of hostages and said Iran is still opposed to
the presence of foreign troops in the region.
   ``We think that the security of the region should be assured by
the countries of the region.''
   Palestine Liberation Organization chief Yasser Arafat, speaking
in Tunis, said Iraq's ``courageous decision will create a favorable
atmosphere to a peaceful and political solution to the gulf
crisis.''
   Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu said he hoped Saddam's
move was a first step toward a peaceful resolution of the crisis.
   But the London newspaper The Daily Telegraph commented today:
``The tone of his (Saddam's) remarks gave little cause for hope
that the likelihood of military action had significantly receded.''
   Some military analysts said a decision to attack Iraqi forces
would be made easier with all the foreigners out of Iraq.
   Michael Dewar, deputy director of the London-based International
Institute for Strategic Studies, was quoted by The Daily Telegraph
as saying: ``It allows airmen to strike (Iraqi) targets with a
totally clear conscience.''
   Some of the foreign hostages had been held as ``human shields''
at strategic sites in Iraq and Kuwait in order to deter any attack
by the U.S.-led multinational force in the gulf.
   In Baghdad, as news spread of Saddam's announcement, the mood
turned to elation among the hostages and some family members who
had come to the Iraqi capital to plead for their loved ones'
release.
   ``I feel delirious that I can leave,'' said David Farington, a
British worker trapped in Iraq.

<HEAD>Japanese Officials Deny U.S. Charge of Stockpiling Oil</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese officials today denied accusations by a
senior U.S. Energy Department official that Japan has been hoarding
crude oil in defiance of an agreement among major consuming nations
to draw down stockpiles.
   ``This is a complete misunderstanding,'' a senior government
official said. ``We are not stockpiling.''
   Linda Stuntz, a U.S. Energy Department under secretary for
policy and planning, told reporters in Washington that in the
months following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Japan increased imports
to meet additional demand instead of drawing down stocks.
   She noted that Japan imported 33 percent more oil in October
than it did in July, and said such actions raised doubts about
future cooperative activities among consuming nations in response
to oil supply shocks.
   The United States and other consumer nations have sought to ease
the immediate shock of losing 4.3 million barrels of oil a day as a
result of the Iraqi invasion by minimizing imports. Stockpiling oil
would contradict such efforts and would put upward pressure on oil
prices.
   Officials in Japan's Foreign Ministry and the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry said that instead of increasing
stocks as planned, Japanese oil companies had actually drawn down
stocks.
   Increased imports, however, were needed during cool winter
months to compensate for higher demand for heating fuel.
   ``The amount of oil imported by Japan fluctuates by 20 to 30
percent every month, depending on seasonal factors. Every year it's
exactly the same pattern,'' said the government official, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   Stuntz's charge that Japan was betraying other oil consuming
nations by not drawing down its 142-day emergency supply
disregarded the fact that the United States is the only country
that has tried to rely on existing stocks, officials said.
   ``No other country has drawn from its emergency stock, and
there's no reason why Japan should,'' the government official said.
   ``I can't imagine why she's saying that. It's a complete
mistake,'' he said. ``Since August, our stocks have been kept at a
142-day supply.''
   In fact, the level of the stockpile increased slightly between
June and October, the most recent month for which statistics are
available. But the growth, from a total of 33.7 million kiloliters
to 33.9 million kiloliters, or about one-third of Japan's daily
consumption, isn't considered significant.
   Japan also has increased crude oil imports to a certain extent
to compensate for shortfalls in supplies of refined oil products
due to the loss of Kuwait's refining system, industry sources
noted.
   ``We've brought in more oil, but less product,'' said Naoki
Kuroda, director general of the international trade and industry
ministry's petroleum department.
   Japan imports nearly all the oil it uses, and 70 percent of its
oil imports come from the Middle East.

   Arizona Gov. Rose Mofford defended Sen. Dennis
DeConcini before the Senate Ethics Committee today, describing him
as a tireless worker for constituents who tried to help an
important employer in his state.
   Mofford testified as a character witness in the ethics panel's
hearings into the so-called Keating Five senators.
   The Democratic governor said she had known DeConcini since he
was a 10-year-old church altar boy. As a three-term senator, she
said, he has built a reputation for getting things done for
constitutents with problems.
   ``Dennis, better than any official I know, works at making the
system work for constituents,'' she said.
   ``Many people in Arizona, I'd say tens of thousands of people
with problems in government, they'd say, `Call Dennis','' she said.
   Mofford testified for less than 20 minutes, and the ethics panel
adjourned its hearings for the weekend following her appearance.
   DeConcini and the other senators face allegations they
improperly intervened with regulators on behalf of Charles H.
Keating Jr., an Arizona businessman with a savings and loan based
in California. Keating donated some $1.3 million to the campaigns
and poltical causes of the five.
   Mofford said that at the time DeConcini helped Keating, Keating
was running a large business that was an important employer in the
state.
   ``He was considered a very successful businessman and very
charitable,'' she said of Keating. His business, she said, seemed
to be ``a secure investment.''
   On Thursday, William K. Black ended two days as a witness,
standing firmly by his allegations of political pressure by the
so-called Keating Five senators in the face of skeptical
questioning from members of the panel.
   Black said he and three other regulators, in a meeting with the
senators, used definitive statements to describe practices at
Keating's Lincoln Savings and Loan. He said the lawmakers were told
the Irvine, Calif., thrift had made massive loans without credit
checks, was ``flying blind,'' had ``incompetent'' management and
was courting failure.
   But, he said, the senators would not accept their warning that
Lincoln was an institution they should avoid.
   ``They were listening and were coming back with defense after
defense after defense of Lincoln, despite us laying out in starkest
terms ... exactly what was wrong,'' Black said in response to
questions by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.
   ``It didn't impress them,'' Black said.
   After a two-hour closed session Thursday, the committee
disclosed a new schedule that could prolong the hearings into
January.
   The panel plans to offer limited use immunity to compel the
testimony of Keating's former lobbyist and top aide, James Grogan.
Committee Vice Chairman Warren Rudman, R-N.H., said Grogan would
produce documents in private next Wednesday and would undergo
questioning in closed session on Dec. 17.
   The senators under scrutiny could begin testifying the next day,
but delays could push that after Christmas or into January.
   Besides DeConcini, the senators under investigation are Arizona
Republican John McCain and Democrats John Glenn of Ohio, Alan
Cranston of California and Donald Riegle of Michigan.
   Under cross-examination by attorneys for the five senators,
Black blamed the lawmakers' pressure for the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board's decision in 1988 to take San Francisco-based regulators off
the examination of Lincoln. The exam would have disclosed phony
transactions and a ``tax-sharing scam'' that sent false profits to
Lincoln's parent company, he said.
   ``This is the most likely explanation for this completely
unprecedented and grossly improper action of halting the
examination that would have blown all of these thing so wide
open,'' said Black, allawyer with the bank board.
   Black was questioned by members of the panel about an earlier
meeting he and the San Francisco-based regulators held with the
senators on April 9, 1987. He testified the regulators said, in
effect, ``This is not the place you want to touch, not with a
10-foot pole, not with a 20-foot pole.''
   He said that by the end of the meeting, Riegle ``had gotten the
message,'' but that Cranston and DeConcini appeared not to have.
Both later made contacts with regulators on behalf of Keating's
effort to avoid some regulatory controls and eventually to sell his
thrift rather than have it taken over by the federal government.
   Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., the Ethics Committee chairman,
questioned Black about notes he took of the meeting. He suggested
that the regulators' references that Lincoln's problems could be
worked out could be viewed as an invitation to negotiate.
   ``We're talking about improper conduct,'' Heflin said, ``and one
of the things about improper conduct is the senators should not go
in and try to negotiate with you, and then it appears to me the
regulators originate that.''
   After similar skeptical questioning by Helms and Sens. David
Pryor, D-Ark., and Terry Sanford, D-N.C., another member of the
panel offered support for Black.
   Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., told Black he had been an impressive
witness, adding, ``You're obviously very capable and I have been
greatly influenced by what you had to say.''

<TEXT>
   Poland's first popular presidential
campaign officially ended today with Lech Walesa sitting on a big
lead in the polls and his challenger looking for votes among
Walesa's rivals.
   The free-wheeling foray into democracy by law had to close at
noon - allowing voters a day and a half to make up their minds.
   Businessman Stanislaw Tyminski, who had threatened to reveal
compromising documents about Walesa, refused any such disclosures
at a Thursday night news conference despite hammering questions by
Polish and Western journalists.
   He said he would reveal what he had only at a rally today in the
Baltic port of Szczecin, ``among friends.'' However, no such
disclosure occurred.
   As he did Thursday night, Tyminski opened the now-infamous black
briefcase in which he has said he carries the materials and pulled
out a copy of a western news magazine interview with Walesa,
Solidarity's chairman. He said:
   ``I cannot show all the documents because it would be harmful
for our country. I have got more. This (magazine interview) is the
most important document, our country's future depends on it.''
   Walesa has denied that any such documents could exist, while
demanding that Tyminski make known anything he claims to have. In
the magazine interview, he warns civil unrest, possibly including a
coup, would likely develop when Tyminski was unable to fulfill his
promises for speedy economic improvement.
   Tyminski, who defeated Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki in the
first round of voting, also said he would not leave the country
regardless of the outcome of the election, and that the 1981
Communist martial-law repression of Solidarity was ``necessary.''
   Also today, Poland's powerful Roman Catholic Primate Jozef Glemp
said after meeting with Polish-born Pope John Paul II in Rome:
``The Polish church will side with Walesa. ... This is not a
political decision but a decision based on the certainty of being
in the best interests of the common good for the whole country.''
   Polls open at 6 a.m. Sunday and close at 8 p.m. for the
country's 27 million eligible voters. Exit surveys by state
television in partnership with the German polling service Infas are
expected to give reliable projections within minutes after voting
stops. Full unofficial returns are expected Monday.
   Tyminski, duplicating his first election round pattern of
campaigning to the last minute, attended a 10 a.m. rally in
Szczecin, the formerly German city in extreme northwest Poland 325
miles from Warsaw.
   The emigre Tyminski was greeted by chants of ``Lech Walesa!''
and ``Back to Peru!'' when he arrived at the rally attended by
4,000 to 5,000 people in a sports hall. Supporters' applause was
mixed with boos and whistles from the several hundred Walesa fans
present.
   ``Tarzan from Peru for president of the Polish People's
Republic,'' said one tongue-in-cheek banner carried by the Walesa
camp, referring to the former Communist name for Poland.
   Outside the arena, some young people dressed up in
``pseudo-Peruvian'' style collected donations ``for the protection
of sacred dogs,'' the PAP news agency said. It was a spoof of
``Sacred Dogs,'' Tyminski's self-published book of political and
economic philosophy co-written with a longtime Communist Party
journalist.
   Polls released as the campaign ended gave Walesa commanding
majorities. The last state television poll, conducted Monday and
Tuesday, said Walesa had a 73 percent to 16 percent advantage.
   Two other polls put the margin at 58 percent to 23 percent and
61 percent to 20 percent.
   Pollsters advised, however, that the surveys be treated
cautiously because they felt many were reluctant to admit even in
an anonymous poll that they support Tyminski.

   Security Council ambassadors today awaited
a U.S. reply on a draft resolution approving of a peace conference
on the Palestinian problem - Iraq's key demand for solving the
Kuwait crisis.
   American officials said U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering was
still consulting with other ambassadors and with Washington this
morning.
   The timing of the introduction of the resolution, after meetings
among U.N. ambassadors Thursday, promised to complicate
U.S.-Israeli relations.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, flying to the United
States today to start an American tour, said in London that
``Israel will not agree to any foreign body deciding its future and
fate.''
   ``Precisely because of our consistent position that we will not
link the gulf crisis and the Arab-Israeli dispute, this is
certainly not an appropriate time for an international
conference,'' Secretary of State James A. Baker III said.
   The United States will not give Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
``some face-saving way out of something he shouldn't have gotten
into in the first place,'' Bush told reporters in Chile.
   The council was supposed to meet late this morning, but
postponed the meeting until the afternoon, with no explanation.
There was no assurance that the meeting would actually be held
later.
   The draft resolution was approved in principle Wednesday by the
permanent five Security Council members - the United States, Soviet
Union, Britain, France and China.
   But President Bush's spokesman said Washington was making
changes in the language of the resolution. U.S. officials said the
changes did not alter the basic thrust of the draft.
   ``We're trying to work out language that is acceptable, that
meets our policy. Obviously the U.N. wants to speak to this
issue,'' said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, in Santiago,
Chile.
   In Baghdad, the parliament today approved Saddam's request to
free all foreign hostages. His request made on Thursday came just
hours after the text of the draft resolution was widely reported,
but it was not clear he was aware of it.
   Baghdad wants to send all the hostages home by Christmas, Iraq's
U.N. ambassador said Thursday.
   ``Definitely, we would like to see everyone with his family by
Christmas, because that is a very joyous and happy occasion, and it
is time for family reunions,'' said Ambassador Abdul Amir
al-Anbari.
   The release of hostages has been a main demand of the Security
Council, which has passed 12 resolutions condemning Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait and authorizing economic sanctions and force to end the
occupation.
   The ``working paper'' agreed to Wednesday by the permanent
Security Council members ``considers that the convening at an
appropriate time of an international peace conference on the Middle
East.''
   The paper says talks that are ``properly structured, with the
participation of the parties concerned, would facilitate the
achievement of a comprehensive settlement and lasting peace in the
Middle East.''
   The problem of a homeland for the Palestinians would be central
to any such peace settlement.
   But the text contains numerous loopholes that would allow Israel
to delay or abort the process. The clause requiring ``the
participation of the parties concerned'' gives Israel virtual veto
power over the conference.
   Saddam proposed on Aug. 12, 10 days after his troops conquered
Kuwait, that he would link a solution of the Palestinian homeland
question to any withdrawal of his army from the emirate.

   Dozens of people in southern Michigan, Kentucky
and Ohio say they saw a bright green and blue light flash across
the sky this morning before the thing, possibly a meteor, seemed to
explode.
   ``Whatever it is, it could have been 200 miles south of us, but
it was huge,'' Mike Dennis of Rockford, north of Grand Rapids, told
WCUZ radio after spotting the light about 5:45 a.m. EST. ``I've
never seen anything like it.''
   Dennis Dixon, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in
Ann Arbor, said there were no reports of meteor showers or other
activity that could account for the sightings. He said the weather
service was unaware of the incident.
   But Maj. Thomas Niemann, a spokesman at the U.S. Space Command
in Colorado Springs, Colo., said the agency believes the object was
of ``other-than-Earth origin.''
   He said the center tracks about 6,700 satellites, none of which
was responsible for the flash. He said it probably was a meteor.
   ``It's been our experience that when you get that color it's of
other-than-Earth origin,'' he said. ``That's what astronomers
around the country have told me.''
   William Spencer of Southfield, a Detroit suburb, said he saw the
light on his way to work in Wayne County's Plymouth Township.
   ``It was a big bluish-green ball of light and it had a train of
yellow sparks behind it. I thought it was a helicopter, it was
moving fast.
   ``It was coming down at a high rate of speed. Then it just
disappeared. I thought it had crashed.''
   In Ohio, the flash was reported by callers from Cincinnati to
Toledo. Reports also were received in Louisville, Ky.
   Officials at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt,
Md., and the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington said they had no
information about satellites or other manmade space objects
crashing to Earth.

   When the Chicago Bears had to look elsewhere
because Neal Anderson couldn't gain ground up the middle last week,
they didn't turn away from their star halfback.
   Instead, Anderson showed how important he is to the Bears'
offense by lining up as a wide receiver and catching a 50-yard
touchdown pass that beat the Detroit Lions in overtime.
   He doesn't get the attention some other backs receive, but
Anderson has quietly become the star of Chicago's offense, as
important to his 10-2 team as Walter Payton and Gale Sayers were to
the Bear teams of the past.
   ``As far as complete backs go, I think I have to be ranked at
the top,'' Anderson said this week as the Bears prepared to play
the Washington Redskins (7-5) Sunday at RFK Stadium.
   The game is more important to the Redskins, who are in the thick
of the NFC's wild-card race. Chicago has already clinched the NFC
Central Division title and is playing for the home field advantage
in the playoffs.
   ``I hope everybody's professional and knows we've still got to
go out and play,'' said Anderson, who is 34 yards short of 4,000
yards rushing for his career. ``Nobody feels like we're going to
ease up. There are a lot of things still on the line.''
   Anderson, in his fifth year in the NFL, hasn't eased up yet this
season.
   He is second in the NFL with 1,298 total yards from scrimmage,
leading a rushing attack that has gained a league-best 1,972 yards
and is one of the chief reasons Chicago has rebounded last season's
6-10 mediocrity.
   The Bears are averaging 164.3 yards a game rushing, well above
the league average of 112.7. While other ground games are
faltering, Chicago is the only team to have more yards rushing than
passing.
   In these days of run-and-shoot offenses, the Bears hand the ball
off 37 times a game, control the ball for more than 34 minutes a
game and pound out wins in what coach Mike Ditka calls a ``blue
collar'' way.
   The Redskins have had trouble against the run all year, at least
until they held Miami to 34 yards rushing in a 42-20 victory last
week.
   Holding Anderson to 27 yards on 13 carries was key to the
Redskins' 38-14 win over the Bears last year.
   ``Chicago pounds at you until they hit a big play,'' said coach
Joe Gibbs. ``If you can't stop the run, it's going to be a long
day.''
   Anderson has been just about the whole story of the Bears'
offense. He is second to fullback Brad Muster with 37 receptions
and leads the team with 445 yards receiving.
   Second to Detroit's Barry Sanders with 853 yards rushing on 216
carries, he is 147 yards short of his third straight 1,000-yard
year on the ground. He is fourth on the Bears all-time rushing list
and 14th on their all-time receiving list.
   When the going got tough against Detroit last week, it was
Anderson who shouted on the sidelines in overtime that he could get
open from a wide receiver's slot.
   ``It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know we like to run,''
said Anderson. ``Teams have stacked things up trying to stop the
run, but we expect to get our yards. Teams are putting eight men on
the line, but we're spreading things out.''
   There were doubts around the league that Anderson could carry
the load as the successor to the legendary Payton in the Chicago
backfield.
   He was a first-round draft choice after setting collegiate
records at Florida (since broken by Cowboy Emmitt Smith), but he
was the next-to-last pick in the first round.
   Other backs went before him and younger players like Smith and
Sanders get more press.
   ``I feel fortunate to have come here,'' he said. ``I have other
friends who have been in losing situations and that's not fun.
   ``I just go out and play like Neal Anderson can play. The guys
in this organization know what I can do. They made me the highest
paid running back in the league in the off-season, so I'm content
where I am,'' he said.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two black anti-apartheid
movements, the conservative Inkatha Freedom Party and the militant
Pan Africanist Congress, opened separate meetings today to respond
to rapid political changes.
   The Pan Africanist Congress has said it opposes negotiations
with South Africa's white-led government, but is expected to review
that policy at the weekend conference, its first inside South
Africa in three decades.
   The group has said that it will only negotiate the handover of
power from whites to blacks, and wants no part of talks on
black-white power sharing as proposed by President F.W. de Klerk.
   The Pan Africanists, who advocate black self-reliance in the
struggle for political rights, were banned in 1960 and legalized in
February by President F.W. de Klerk.
   Some Pan Africanist members chanted ``Down With Negotiations!''
before the party opened its meeting at a recreation center in
Soweto, the huge black township outside Johannesburg.
   Zeph Mothopeng, leader of the Pan Africanists, died in October.
The group plans to select a new leader this weekend. Clarence
Makwetu, the acting president, is considered the favorite.
   In his opening address, Makwetu said reforms by de Klerk's
government were of ``no consequence.''
   ``They are merely intending to reform apartheid,'' Makwetu said
of the government. ``We say apartheid cannot be reformed but must
be totally destroyed.''
   The Inkatha Freedom Party met in Ulundi, the capital of the
KwaZulu black homeland, to adopt a party constitution.
   Of the major black political groups, Inkatha is the most
conservative. Its leader, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, supports
capitalism, opposes economic sanctions against South Africa and has
never supported violence against the government.
   The National Party, which has ruled South Africa since 1948, has
hinted it may seek an alliance with Inkatha.
   Buthelezi says he is ready to participate in talks with the
government on ending apartheid.
   The country's largest black political movement, the African
National Congress, is scheduled to hold a major conference Dec.
14-16.
   De Klerk wants to open talks early next year on a new
constitution that will extend political rights to blacks and allow
the 5 million whites and 30 million blacks to share power.

<HEAD>Burma Arrests 48 for Allegedly Planning Parallel Government</HEAD>

   The military junta has arrested 48 members
of the opposition National League for Democracy in recent days for
planning to establish a shadow government, a senior military
official said today.
   The opposition movement overwhelmingly won popular elections in
May, but the military has refused to turn over power.
   The senior official, Maj. Gen. Khin Nyunt, also said 77 Buddhist
monks in Mandalay, the nation's religious center and second largest
city, have been arrested for anti-government activities.
   He said documents seized from the National League for
Democracy's headquarters in Rangoon showed it planned to hold a
meeting of at least 250 of its members in Mandalay or the capital.
   At that meeting, he said, the League planned to adopt a national
constitution and declare a temporary, parallel government that
would seek recognition from the United Nations, the United States,
European nations, Australia, India, Thailand and Singapore.
   The documents also show the League planned to organize a strike
to disrupt transportation and paralyze the government, Khin Nyunt
told a news conference.
   He showed reporters photographs of 48 party members arrested in
connection with the plan. Fourteen others remain at large, he said.
   The government came to power in September 1988 by killing
hundreds of unarmed pro-democracy demonstrators.
   It already has arrested dozens of opposition figures, and
international human rights groups have accused it of rights abuses.
   The National League for Democracy's two main leaders, Aung San
Suu Kyi and Tin Oo, have been detained for more than a year.
   On Wednesday, the state press said seven opposition members had
fled to avoid prosecution for having discussed forming a shadow
government.
   Five of the seven were members of the National League for
Democracy, it said. All had won parliamentary seats in the May
election.
   Khin Nyunt also said 80 members of the outlawed Burma Communist
Party had been arrested. He did not say when. The government
frequently has alleged Communist connections to activities by other
opposition groups.
   The general alleged without elaborating that one monk, known as
Yewata, had met with a U.S. Embassy official to discuss organizing
nationwide protests.
   The government often accuses embassies of helping the
opposition.

   A man imprisoned since 1984 for kidnapping
and sexually assaulting a 3-year-old girl and then leaving her for
dead in an outhouse pit was released from prison today.
   Robert Thiret, whose release Gov. Roy Romer tried in vain to
block, did not speak as he and his attorney emerged from the
facility and got into a van. His destination was not known.
   Colorado law requires Thiret to be set free - no parole, no
probation, no restrictions, even though authorities have said they
still consider him a menace, and psychologists say he's made
``minimal'' progress in therapy.
   Thiret, 28, was convicted of snatching a 3-year-old girl in
Sheridan in 1983. She was found alive three days later in an
outhouse pit at a campground 20 miles west of Denver near Genesee.
She had been sexually assaulted and left for dead.
   Thiret has been at the Jefferson County Sheriff's Complex, where
he was serving a six-month sentence for telephone harassment after
getting out of the state penitentiary where he served six years of
a 10-year sentence for attempted murder and sexual assault on a
child.
   Onlookers who had shown up at the jail to watch Thiret's release
were urged to leave by sheriff's officials.
   News of Thiret's impending release had angered residents and led
Romer to criticize state parole law.
   Thiret was up for parole in 1989, but public pressure pushed
authorities to continue to hold him. In May, the Colorado Supreme
Court ruled that because of the delay, under the law in effect at
the time of the attack Thiret had to be freed - not paroled.
   On June 23, Thiret was transferred from state prison to the
Jefferson County Jail to serve the harassment sentence.
   Stephen Bakker, a rescue volunteer who carried Thiret's
shivering victim from the outhouse pit, questioned why he should be
released from jail.
   ``I just don't believe anybody who could do something like that
to a little girl is going to change just by being in jail,'' Bakker
said.
   Bakker said he still can see the 3-year-old girl, wearing only
her underwear, shivering in the outhouse pit where she had been
left for dead.
   ``I don't see how anybody could do that to a child - just
leaving her in a pit like that,'' he said. ``She was disoriented.
She was just looking for something warm to hold onto. As soon as I
touched her, she grabbed me and held on until I pulled her out.''
   The girl recovered.

   American hostages raised beer mugs to toast
their impending freedom today after parliament overwhelmingly
approved Saddam Hussein's decision to free all foreigners trapped
by the Persian Gulf crisis.
   The 250-member National Assembly, which has no record of ever
defying Saddam, passed the measure with a vote of 232-18, reporters
said.
   It freed more than 8,000 Westerners, East Europeans and Japanese
stranded by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. Officials said
foreigners would be allowed to begin leaving as early as Saturday.
   In Washington, State Department officials said they have asked
Iraq to waive the exit visas but hadn't heard a response.
   The officials say they are also awaiting answers from Baghdad
regarding other departure arrangements for the Americans.
Contingency plans have been made to charter airplanes, but no
schedule has yet been made.
   At the downtown Mansour-Melia Hotel, which has become known as
Hostage Central, 50 American and British hostages hugged and kissed
each other and clinked their beer mugs together to celebrate their
impending release.
   ``This is it. We're all free,'' one hostage shouted when a
reporter told him of the Parliament vote.
   In the past, hostages have been gathered at the Mansour-Melia
Hotel before transportation to strategic sites to serve as ``human
shields.'' It is also where they have been taken to meet visiting
relatives.
   About 600 Americans, Britons and Japanese have been held at
strategic sites to deter attack by the 350,000-strong, U.S.-led
multinational forces arrayed against Iraq in the Persian Gulf to
force Baghdad from Kuwait.
   ``It is a monumental occasion,'' said Robert Vinton, a
businessman from Santa Fe, N.M. He was taken to the hotel Wednesday
to see his wife, Sue. She had flown in with several American and
British women to appeal for the release of their husbands, sons and
fathers.
   Vinton, 58, said he was picked up in Kuwait and taken to a
military installation 20 miles south of Baghdad. He said he and
other hostages there were treated ``as well as may be expected.''
   Ronald Ginn, 49, a computer consultant from Seattle who had been
living in Kuwait before the invasion said: ``My main complaint was
the loss of freedom.'' He said he had been held at two
communications centers in Baghdad. Ginn said his house in Kuwait
was stripped clean after the invasion and estimated he had lost
$80,000 worth of property.
   An estimated 2,000 foreigners remain in hiding in Kuwait for
fear of detention as ``human shields'' at potential targets.
   The National Assembly decision meant the foreigners could apply
for exit permits, a process that could take several days to
complete. Iraqi officials said, however, the evacuation might begin
as early as Saturday, indicating authorities planned to speed up
the procedure.
   ``If they waive the (exit) visa requirement, I guarantee we'll
get them out as fast as we possibly can,'' U.S. Charge d'Affaires
Joseph Wilson said after the parliament vote.
   Officials said flights would be added to the daily Iraqi Airways
trip to Amman, Jordan, the airline's only regular destination since
the United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Iraq because of
the invasion.
   Countries wishing to send special flights to Baghdad to retrieve
their nationals must first get clearance from the U.N. sanctions
committee, the officials said.
   A British Airways jet stocked with champagne left London for the
Middle East today to pick up hostages. Planes were also being
prepared in Denmark and Japan. Dutch officials said they expected
to send a flight next week.
   In London, a spokesman for British Airways said the plane had
left for Baghdad but was awaiting approval to land from the U.N.
Sanctions Committee and Iraqi officials. Without approval the plane
would be diverted to Amman.
   In New York, Iraq's U.N. ambassador Abdul Amir al-Anbari said
Baghdad wants all the hostages it has been holding to be home by
Christmas.
   The Iraqi ambassador said it might speed the release of
detainees if the United States sent planes to Jordan to pick them
up.
   ``It is a matter of logistical things,'' he said.
   Saddam on Thursday urged parliament to end the travel ban on
foreigners in a letter to assembly speaker Saleh.
   Saddam said their internment was meant to ``delay war'' and give
the Iraqi troops occupying Kuwait time to complete mobilization.
Now that they have done so, Saddam said, there was no longer any
need for the hostages.
   He also noted that recent diplomatic overtures indicated
``positive changes'' in the international standoff against Iraq,
and said the release of hostages would encourage such trends.
   In all, there are 2 million foreigners in Iraq and occupied
Kuwait. Asians and Arabs who make up the majority of the foreigners
who were free to leave.
   Meanwhile, nearly 250 Soviets freed from Iraq arrived aboard an
Aeroflot jetliner in Moscow today. Iraq freed Soviet nationals
after the Kremlin indicated it might use force against Iraq if its
citizens were harmed.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hortense Gabel, a prominent judge and social
reformer whose career was marred by her involvement in the Bess
Myerson conflict-of-interest case, died early today. She was 77.
   Mrs. Gabel, who died at her Upper East Side apartment, had long
been in poor health and had suffered a number of minor strokes this
year, according to her accountant, Edward Speer.
   She was a leader in the fight against racial discrimination in
housing in the years after World War II, serving as executive
director of the Committee on Discrimination in Housing, a coalition
of religious and civil rights groups.
   More recently, she was a judge in state Supreme Court - New
York's trial-level court - from 1976 until her resignation in 1987.
   The following year, a federal jury acquitted her of charges that
she improperly helped her daughter get a job in the office of Ms.
Myerson, the city's cultural affairs commissioner.
   Gabel had been accused of influencing Ms. Myerson, a former Miss
America and prominent New York political figure, by making rulings
favorable to Ms. Myerson's boyfriend in a divorce case.
   Despite her anger that the case came to trial, ``She was very
gratified by the result,'' a friend, Roma Connable, said today.
``She felt she had been vindicated.''

   A dozen masked men tied up three people
at a a vacation complex early Friday and blew up 10 apartments,
police reported.
   No group claimed responsibility, but the attack bore the
hallmark of the separatist Corsican National Liberation Front,
which views tourism as colonization by mainland France.
   Police reported that the gang shook the owner Robert Monvosin,
his son, and the superintendent out of their sleep and tied them up
in the back of a van.
   The men, wearing ski masks, then scattered about 60 bottles of
gas throughout the complex and exploded them, destroying most of
the apartments. There were no vacationers present.
   The attack took place at Lumio, south of Bastia, the
second-largest town on this French island in the Mediterranean.
   The separatist movement has engaged in a decade-long campaign of
bombing villas, hotels and vacation complexes, especially those
owned by non-Corsicans.

   Two employees of Thailand's national
airline were arrested Friday with about 100 pounds of heroin hidden
in two suitcases, police said.
   The two were arrested in the parking lot of the domestic
terminal of Bangkok's airport, according to the Narcotics Control
Board.
   The suspects were identified as Prakai Thongdee, 33, and Suthep
Chuenchoop, 36, but their exact positions with Thai Airways
International were not given.
   Narcotics officials say a vast amount of heroin is smuggled from
Thailand by air and sea to the United States, Europe, Australia and
other Asian points.
   Most of the narcotics originate in the so-called Golden Triangle
of northern Thailand, Burma and Laos where warlords refine opium
into heroin and smuggle it out through numerous illegal
connections.

   Columbia's astronauts were back
star-gazing today after scientists on the ground fired up the $150
million Astro observatory, which has been crippled by repeated
malfunctions.
   While two astronomers aboard the shuttle helped ground teams
guide the telescopes, two other crew members conducted a live
science lesson this morning for middle school students at two NASA
centers.
   ``You may have heard of some of the problems we've been
having,'' astronaut Jeffrey Hoffman told the youngsters. ``It's
been quite an interesting and dynamic mission.''
   Troubles have persisted throughout the mission and have forced
the astronauts to skip more than 100 planned observations. About
250 celestial targets were to have been studied.
   The latest problem occurred Thursday when a backup computer
terminal aboard the spacecraft that had been running the
observatory's three ultraviolet telescopes overheated and shut
down. The other computer terminal failed Sunday.
   Lint, which can accumulate from such items as astronauts'
clothing, paper products and hand towels on the shuttle, was found
clogging the air vents of the first failed terminal, flight
director Gary Coen said. He said the second terminal hadn't been
fully inspected yet.
   Coen said the cause of the computer failures has not been
determined and he didn't know if it was connected to the lint
buildup.
   Despite the setbacks, the crew proceeded with today's lesson,
the first in what NASA hopes will become a regular science series
for youngsters.
   Hoffman and Sam Durrance, before starting 12 hours of
observation work, talked to the students for more than a half-hour
about star formation and the many different kinds of radiation
emitted from celestial objects.
   To mark his debut as a teacher, Hoffman wore a dress shirt and
tie - the first tie ever worn in space ``as far as I know,'' he
said.
   ``I can tell you it works quite well. You have to be a little
careful in zero gravity, as you can see,'' Hoffman said, pushing
down his floating tie.
   The other astronomers on the seven-man crew - Robert Parker and
Ron Parise - answered questions from the students later in the
morning at the end of their work shift. Parise, in response to an
Alabama boy's query, said it has been ``quite tedious and
time-consuming'' trying to operate the observatory.
   Twelve students were at Marshall Space Flight Center in
Huntsville, Ala., and 29 were at Goddard Space Flight Center in
Greenbelt, Md. Other students were able to watch the presentations
in their classrooms via cable television services.
   Meanwhile, the Astro observatory is being run by commands sent
from the ground that guide the telescopes toward their desired
targets. The astronauts, using a joystick and aided by information
from the ground, can then zero in on an object.
   The process succeeded several times Thursday night and early
today, giving scientists hope that many more observations can be
made before Columbia's 10-day flight ends Tuesday.
   ``Our attitude here is that we've got a mode we feel is going to
work and we're going to go get the science,'' mission manager Jack
Jones said. But he added he didn't know yet how efficient the
operation would be.
   Spacelab Mission Operations Control's John David Bartoe
congratulated the astronauts this morning for obtaining
``fantastic'' observations of a quasar, one of the most distant
objects in the universe. All three ultraviolet telescopes focused
on the quasar for 51 minutes, three minutes longer than planned.
   ``That's what happens when you have good, old-fashioned
astronomy ... and a little bit of help from your friends,'' Parker
told Bartoe.
   A total of 187 observations were planned between late Sunday and
Thursday morning, but only 70 were completed because of the
computer malfunctions and other problems, said NASA spokeswoman
Cindy Sanderson.
   Earlier this week, the astronauts missed precious viewing time
because of trouble with the observatory's instrument-pointing
system, which guides the three ultraviolet telescopes. The four
astronomers on the flight often had to resort to manually guiding
the telescopes.
   The observatory's X-ray telescope, which is operated by computer
commands sent from Goddard Space Flight Center, was unaffected
because it has its own pointing system.
   Moments before the backup computer terminal shut down Thursday,
the crew smelled a burning odor similar to one that filled the
cabin Sunday when the other terminal shut down.
   NASA tried to restart the first terminal after the lint was
vacuumed from its filters, but the smell reappeared and Hoffman
quickly shut it down.
   Controllers have not decided whether to try to restart the
second terminal, Coen said.
   The problems were the latest for the mission, which had been
delayed for six months this year because of shuttle fuel leaks and
other telescope problems. The mission had originally been scheduled
for 1986 but was postponed after the Challenger accident.

   Thieves hijacked a van carrying
U.S. Consulate documents and stole eight diplomatic pouches, police
said Friday.
   Police spokesman Helio Mazzeo said 12 men armed with shotguns
and submachine guns intercepted the van Wednesday on its way to the
consulate from Rio's Galeao Airport.
   The driver and two consulate employees were released unhurt, he
said. The van, missing the diplomatic pouches, was found the next
day in a street on Rio's poor north side.
   ``We're working with two hypotheses: either it was a simple
robbery or it had other, possibly political, motives,'' Mazzeo
said. He did not elaborate.
   Mazzeo said the pouches, containing documents, were part of a
routine diplomatic shipment from Brasilia, the nation's capital.
The content of the documents was not known, he said.
   The U.S. Consulate refused to comment on the robbery. The local
press speculated the robbers were looking for dollars.

   A train crowded with students going to
school crashed into a truck at an unmarked crossing Friday,
injuring about 30 people, none seriously, officials said.
   It was the second accident in two days involving school
children. On Thursday, a military jet crashed into a high school in
a suburb of Bologna, killing 12 students and injuring 87 other
people.
   Friday's incident occurred at an unmarked crossing on the
outskirts of this city on the southern coast of the Italian island.
   Police said the train was carrying 374 passengers, many of them
students.
   The locomotive and one of the four passenger cars derailed
following the impact. About 30 people were taken to hospitals, and
nearly all were released after treatment.

<BYLINE>Wood or Plastic? What's an Environmentalist Supposed To Trim?
^By CHARLES CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environmentalists are facing their annual
Christmas quandary: reusable plastic or recyclable wood?
   ``The artificial Christmas tree represents a bit of a dilemma
for green consumers,'' said Joel Makower, publisher of the monthly
Green Consumer Letter. ``It seems phony and far from ecological,
but it is a reusable thing and eliminates cutting a tree and
sending it to a landfill.''
   Some people, of course, have no doubts about which tree to
choose.
   ``A real tree equals a real Christmas,'' said Jeanne Weiss,
spokeswoman for the National Christmas Tree Association in
Milwaukee, Wis.
   ``Real trees are recyclable, they're a renewable resource and
biodegradable, whereas fake trees are generally made out of
petroleum byproducts and metal,'' she said.
   Christmas trees are farmed on about a million of acres of land
in all 50 states, taking seven to 15 years to grow to suitable
height, the association said. Seedlings are planted to replace each
year's harvest of about 36 million trees, very few of which come
from wild forests any more.
   ``Personally, I wish people would buy more plastic trees because
that's what I sell,'' says Meyer Stopol, vice president of New
York's James A. Cole Inc., a major importer of artificial Christmas
trees, nearly all of which come from the Far East.
   ``People today decorate much earlier at home. By the time
Christmas comes, the (real) tree's dried out,'' he said, adding
that the trees are put out as garbage after the holiday.
   Artificial trees, Stopol says, can last for many years.
   The truly committed may opt for a living, potted Christmas tree,
plantable outdoors after the tinsel comes down.
   But that can be a lot of trouble, especially in parts of country
where the ground may freeze by late December.
   ``Something like that takes planning,'' Ms. Weiss said. ``In
some areas, it's not a viable option.''
   Makower suggested hat a living indoor holiday tree need not
resemble a towering forest pine.
   ``There's no question that having a live Christmas tree is the
greenest thing to do,'' he said. ``A small potted plant will do.''
   But not everyone will be ready to settle for trimming the
schefflera or hanging spider plant.
   Environmentalists say the most important thing is making sure
the tree doesn't just go into the trash after the holidays.
   Pine needles are good conditioners for some soils. The trunks
can be cut up for garden stakes or shredded for mulch. And more and
more nurseries and county parks departments are eager to accept
dead Christmas trees to get the mulch.
   The Ikea home furnishing chain, which has six stores mostly on
the East Coast, is even willing to lease a Christmas tree for $20.
   Mark Wells, operation manager for Ikea's outlet in Dale City,
Va., said customers who bring back their tree on the first or
second Saturday in January will get either a $10 refund plus their
own mulch, or $20 toward a $100 purchase if they leave the mulch
for Ikea to donate to the local parks department.
   ``We lose money on the deal,'' he said. ``But we're proud that
we try to do something to help the environment.''
   Makower said no one should think one tree a year is too small a
matter to make a difference.
   ``If we've learned anything in the environmental movement, it's
that we should celebrate the earth in everything we do, whether
it's in celebrating Christmas, Hanukkah, or even the winter
solstice,'' he said.

<HEAD>Detroit Mayor Recorded Discussing Transfer of Secret Millions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Coleman Young was recorded discussing how
to legally declare as income millions of dollars he owned in real
estate, diamonds and precious metals, according to a published
report.
   He talked about the holdings in tape recordings secretly made by
Kenneth Weiner, a former deputy police chief on trial for his
alleged role in a scheme to defraud investors in a precious metals
business, The Detroit News reported Thursday.
   Young and Weiner were partners in Detroit Technology and
Investments Inc.
   Weiner also is a central figure in a federal investigation into
the disappearance of more than $1 million from a Detroit Police
Department fund. Police Chief William Hart has accused Weiner
publicly of stealing from the fund.
   The tapes focus on Young's efforts to have the assets
transferred to the company so they could be declared on his income
taxes as income. The tapes don't indicate how Young acquired the
assets or whether the transfers took place.
   ``No comment,'' Young spokesman Bob Berg said when asked about
the tapes.
   Weiner made 75 secret recordings in 1986-87 while acting as an
informant for FBI and Internal Revenue Service investigators in an
effort to receive leniency for his role in the investment scheme.
   Federal agents later said Weiner was an unreliable informant and
broke off their relationship with him in 1987.
   Young, who's black, has claimed repeatedly during his
administration that he is the target of racially motivated
government attempts to entrap him. He was first elected mayor in
1973.
   The tapes reveal that Young, 72, owned land worth more than $4
million at the time, and more than $1 million in gold coins, the
newspaper said.
   U.S. District Court Judge John Feikens has given copies and
transcripts of the tapes to lawyers in the fraud case and has said
he will let some of the tapes be played in court.
   In one tape of a Feb. 19, 1987 discussion, Weiner asked Young
what he wanted to do with up to $300,000 worth of gold coins he had
in safety-deposit boxes.
   ``Hold it until such time that we can take credit for it,''
Young said according to a transcript printed by the news.
   ``You mean bringing it through the corporation?'' Weiner said.
   ``Mm-hmm,'' Young replied in affirmation.

   You know how to whistle, don't you? Just put a
dome-shaped skyscraper together and let the wind blow.
   Case in point: the 72-story Cityspire. Wind whipping around the
louvered top of the building, 800 feet above the street, emits a
high-pitched wail that echoes for blocks through Manhattan's
concrete canyons, city officials said Friday.
   ``From Third Avenue, down to the 40s, up to the 60s, over on the
West Side - the calls have come from all over,'' said Ian Matthews
of the city Department of Environmental Conservation.''
   ``The callers said basically there's a noise, and it's driving
me batty, and I don't know where it's coming from.''
   On Wednesday, department investigators solved that last problem.
After more than a month of searching, they zeroed in on the
Cityspire at Seventh Avenue amd West 56th Street, went up to the
roof, and found the eight-sided dome was wailing away.
   A summons was issued for violating the city noise control code.
If the building is found guilty, a fine of $220 to $880 can be
imposed.
   ``With the right winds, it becomes a big whistle,'' said
Matthews. ``I don't know the acoustics, but it's a very loud, very
big whistle. And if you lived in the neighborhood, it could drive
you insane.''
   Just ask Anthony Mazzola, editor in chief of Harper's Bazaar who
lives two blocks from the building. The siren call sent him
scurrying around the neighborhood, desperate to find its source.
   ``I've been all over the street trying to find the noise,'' said
Mazzola. ``You think you're in a loony bin. You can't get away from
it.''
   Mazzola was not alone. The department received hundreds of
complaints durring the past five weeks about the aggravating
reverberation, Matthews said.
   This was news to the building's developer and its architect, who
knew nothing of the alleged noise pollution.
   ``When somebody calls and says, `Your building's whistling' - I
mean, hey, come on,'' said Howard Hornstein, the lawyer for
building developer Ian Bruce Eichner.
   Hornstein said his side is waiting for a copy of the complaint
before responding, although architect Sam Saccia of the
architecture firm Murphy-Jahn in Chicago believes the whistling -
if it exists - can be stopped.
   The sound doesn't occur every day; the wind must be coming in at
the right speed. The largest number of complaints occurred around
Veteran's Day, when the wind gusted to 30 mph, said Matthews. On
Wednesday, gusts reached 23 mph. Reporters heard no buildings
whistling on Friday, when the air was nearly calm.
   It's not the first time the Cityspire has drawn unwanted
attention. When the building was completed, it stood 814 feet tall
- 11 feet above a city-imposed limit.
   The ensuing controversy ended when developer Eichner agreed to
construct more than 7,000 feet of dance space for non-profit groups
in his building. Hornstein is beginning to wonder if it's all worth
it.
   ``The point is, first we had the height issue, now we've got the
whistling building, and I've been lawyering it through the whole
thing,'' said Hornstein. ``I mean, really. The city approved these
plans.''

   Iraq's decision to release
hostages is welcome news for U.S. troops, but they said Friday the
Persian Gulf crisis won't be settled until Kuwait is freed and
Saddam Hussein is stopped.
   ``I think it's all well and good, but I don't think we should
leave here until this thing is resolved,'' said Senior Airman Ken
Hardwick, 23, of Charleston, S.C.
   ``It's not about hostages. It's about Kuwait. If we don't get
Kuwait back, then this guy's going to have the power to run over
other countries. We've got to stop him before he goes any
further,'' Hardwick said.
   Any progress toward a negotiated settlement is cheered by the
troops who were first ordered to the Saudi Arabian desert four
months ago by President Bush. But they noted that the hostage issue
was only one of the conditions Bush set to resolve the crisis.
   ``I think the hostages were a bad side effect of this whole
thing,'' said 1st Lt. Brian Ratchford, 26, of Spartenburg, S.C.,
and a member of the 39th Tactical Air Squadron.
   ``I don't want to go to war, but if we have to, I think it's
better than the alternative of letting (Saddam) develop his nuclear
weapons capabilities, which I see as the ultimate evil,'' he said.
   Most troops are suspicious of Saddam's motive and timing,
especially since he once referred to hostages as ``guests'' and
deployed them around military targets as human shields.
   ``Is it a signal that he is caving in or is it that he's trying
to buy additional time to get support from someone else?'' asked
1st Sgt. Jerry Carlton, 37, of Warsaw, N.C., and a member of the
Army's 82nd Airborne Division.
   However, Carlton added, ``I think it's a good gesture at
Christmas time to give some hopes for all the troops and the
families back home that we may be able to get back home.''
   Other members of the 82nd Airborne, the first ground troops to
arrive in Saudi Arabia, also distrusted the announcement.
   ``The majority of the people think it's a ploy to stall for
time,'' said Spec. Mark Mattson, 30, of Port Huron, Mich. ``We need
to play some hardball. If you don't knock him down, he's going to
be even stronger.''
   Soldiers who came here primed for battle have ridden a roller
coaster of shifting emotions while diplomats have tried to settle
the crisis with talk instead of bullets.
   ``If we can get the mission done without firing a shot, great.
We'll pack up, he'll move out and we'll go home. Plain as that,''
said Army Sgt. Anthony Sikora, 24, of Chester, Pa.
   And Air Force Staff Sgt. Chester Smolarczyk, 28, of
Jacksonville, Ark., said he's willing to wait a while longer for
diplomacy - even if the hostage release is just a stalling tactic.
   ``Which is cheaper, blood or oil?'' asked Smolarczyk.

<BYLINE>IWF Study: Reinforcing Sexual Stereotypes?

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sponsors of a International Women's Forum
study which concluded that female managers lead differently than
men denied on Friday charges that the report contributed to sexual
stereotypes.
   The study said that women manage, to a greater extent than men,
by personal interaction with their subordinates. It says men are
more likely to manage on a more authoritarian,
reward-and-punishment system.
   ``We are not blaming them. We are not saying it's better or
worse. We are just saying it's different,'' Judy B. Rosener, a
professor in the graduate school of management at the University of
California in Irvine, said at a news conference.
   ``We don't want an interactive leader in Saudi Arabia at the
moment,'' said Ms. Rosener, the author of the report. ``I would
think we want a command and control type.''
   Cynthia Maduro Ryan, a Washington lawyer and former corporate
executive who is president of the IWF, said `We are not here in any
way to discredit the command and control or authoritarian style.''
   ``It was basically appropriate and well done for purposes of the
industrial era,'' she said. ``We are going through rapid changes in
the information age and a period of adjustment. Women are not
having to unlearn the other style because they never adapted to it
in the beginning.''
   The International Women's Forum is an organization of prominent
women leaders in 16 countries, including astronaut Sally Ride,
former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Supreme Court
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.
   Ms. Rosener said she has received about a hundred telephone
calls about the study since her article on its findings appeared in
the November-December issue of the Harvard Business Review.
   ``People are saying, `Gender has nothing to do with it. You are
really enforcing gender stereotypes','' she said.
   But, she said, ``We are not saying that all women behave one way
and all men behave another way.''
   The Harvard Business Review will run a dozen or so letters on
the subject, many of them critical, along with the author's
response, in its January-February issue, Ms. Rosener said.
   The study was based on responses from 355 members of the forum
and 101 men in similar positions.
   It says the typical woman surveyed ``prefers the use of personal
power, that is, power based on her charisma, work record, and
contact, as contrasted with structural power based on the authority
that comes with organizational position, title, and the ability to
reward and punish.''
   It says the women make the same amount of money as men in
comparable positions but ``appear to lead differently than their
male colleagues; they are likely to be more transformational than
their male peers.''
   Most of them are married, the report said.
   ``The story the findings tell is that it is possible to combine
family and career, earn a substantial income, and not act
`masculine' in order to succeed,'' the study said.

<HEAD>Reports: Bok May Join Think Tank; Louis Sullivan a Possible
Successor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Harvard University President Derek C.
Bok is expected to join an independent think tank after stepping
down in June, according to a published report.
   The Boston Globe quoted unidentified sources in a report
Thursday that Bok would become a member of the Center for Advanced
Study in the Behavioral Sciences. The center is on Stanford
University's campus but is independent of the school.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan is one of the
candidates reportedly being considered to succeed Bok. A spokesman
in Sullivan's office said Friday he had no comment.
   Harvard refused to confirm both reports.
   Others reportedly being considered to succeed Bok are James O.
Freedman, president of Dartmouth College; Nan Keohane, president of
Wellesley College; and Adele S. Simmons, president of the MacArthur
Foundation.
   A spokesman for the think tank said: ``At regular intervals,
through lengthy evaluations, awards of eligibility are made. Bok
has been eligible for some time, and not everyone who is eligible
does come.''
   Philip Converse, the center's director, said it was founded in
1954 ``to strengthen the behavioral sciences by providing time for
interdisciplinary communication in a residential setting.''
   Bok, 60, announced last June that he will step down as Harvard's
25th president. He was named president in 1971 after serving as
dean of Harvard Law School. Bok grew up in Beverly Hills, Calif.,
and graduated from Stanford in 1951. He also is a graduate of
Harvard Law School.

<HEAD>Congressional Study Says Medicaid Formula Outdated</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's poorest states lost $3.2 billion
in federal health-care dollars for the needy in 1989 because of an
outdated formula for distributing Medicaid funds, the General
Accounting Office said Friday.
   The GAO said the formula, which bases payment on an average of
per capita income, should be eliminated because it fails to account
for the actual number of people living in poverty in a state and
the ability of that state to raise revenues.
   ``The formula does not target most federal funds to states with
the greatest needs ... those with weak tax bases and high
concentrations of poor people,'' GAO researcher Janet L. Shikles
told the House Government Operations subcommittee on human
resources and intergovernmental relations.
   The hearing was called to investigate the growing strains on the
federal-state program that is supposed to provide health care to
the poor, serving 26 million people this year.
   ``Perhaps the most significant weakness of per capita income as
an indicator of a state's ability to finance program benefits is
that it does not reflect all the income states are potentially able
to tax,'' she said.
   The federal government pays 55 percent of medical expenses under
Medicaid; states pay the rest. The GAO said the combined
expenditures totaled $61 billion in 1989.
   Shikles specifically mentioned taxable business earnings that
don't get counted when calculating per capita income.
   If poverty levels and ``taxable resources'' had been used in
tandem with reducing the federal share to 40 percent, nine states
would have received more than $100 million in additional payments
in 1989, Shikles said.
   States that would have benefited are Arkansas, California,
Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, New York, Tennessee and
Texas.
   The 55 percent federal cap allows richer states to collect more
than they need, she said.
   Per capita income represents an average of income, so a high
percentage of wealthy individuals would raise the average even
though large numbers of people live in poverty, as in New York or
California.
   A dozen states, mostly in the Northeast and Midwest, each would
have had payments reduced by more than $100 million, she said.
Those states are Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maryland,
Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania
and Wisconsin.
   The overall difference would have been $3.2 billion, according
to GAO estimates.
   GAO, the government investigative agency, first proposed
eliminating the formula in 1983. Since then, Congress has allowed
use of the formula in the distribution of grants for mental health
and substance abuse treatment programs.
   The idea has been resurrected because of the crisis in Medicaid
funding brought on by the expansion of types of coverage required
and soaring medical costs, as well as the growing number of poor
elderly and of children born into poverty.
   Friday's hearing focused on that crisis, and included testimony
from Democratic Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas.
   Clinton, chairman of the National Governors' Association task
force on health care, said after the hearing that he favors the
change but could not speak for all 50 overnors.
   ``There's no unified position they could take on that,'' said
Alicia Pelrine, group director for human resources at the
governors's association. ``There isn't a state in the union that
can afford to take less money and still do what they're being asked
to do.''
   Clinton said Congress has rapidly expanded the numbers of people
eligible for coverage and raising their income limits, replacing
options with mandates. The coverage of poor women and children and
of nursing home residents are areas that have grown in the last
four years, he said.
   ``I have no problems with the mandates, but the practical impact
has been to wreak havoc on a lot of state budgets,'' he said.
   He said Medicaid is growing faster than any other state program,
rising from 10 percent of state budgets in 1985 to 14 percent in
1990. It's projected that portion will increase to 17 percent in
1995.
   Sara Rosenbaum of the Children's Defense Fund, a children's
rights group, said there ``are better measures,'' but that the
revised formula overlooks the varying costs of medical care from
state to state should be considered.
   Massachusetts, which would have received $437 million less under
the GAO formula, has very expensive medical care.
   Attention, she said, should be focused on ``lapses of federal
policy,'' such as a lack of health insurance for more than 30
million Americans, that push people into poverty.

<HEAD>US to Withdraw Diplomats from Kuwait Embassy</HEAD>

   The United States will withdraw its diplomats
from the beleaguered U.S. Embassy in Kuwait once they finish
helping all Americans who wish to leave the country, the State
Department said today.
   The embassy will remain open but unstaffed, said spokeswoman
Margaret Tutwiler. The United States expects the Iraqis to
safeguard the premises once the Americans leave, she said.
   Despite Iraq's order to shut down the embassy, the United States
had insisted on leaving it staffed, partly as a symbolic gesture of
defiance against the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait.
   Eight American diplomats have been virtual prisoners at the
embassy in Kuwait City since the end of August. They have been
subsisting on meager rations, with their water and electricity cut
off, and prevented by Iraqi troops from leaving the compound.
   President Bush expressed repeated anger at the treatment of the
diplomats, saying it violated all international norms of diplomatic
behavior.
   But Tutwiler said that once all Americans who wish to leave
Kuwait are allowed to do so, the embassy ``will have fulfilled its
major remaining task.''
   The diplomats' main job was to keep in touch with the estimated
300 Americans still in Kuwait, some of them in hiding from Iraqi
troops.
   Since the United States doesn't recognize Iraqi control of
Kuwait, ``we are not going to be doing normal routine government
business with Iraqi occupation forces,'' she said.
   Two British diplomats have also been holding out at their own
embassy in Kuwait.
   The United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution several
weeks ago calling for the two embassies to be provided with food.
But the world body was unable to make arrangements for restocking
the two missions.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is allowing all foreigners to
leave Iraq and Kuwait, and the Americans are expected to start
leaving as early as Saturday.

   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole said Friday
he will introduce a bill early next month to grant some tax relief
for military personnel serving in the Persian Gulf area.
   His bill would waive interest charges for failing to pay any
taxes due by the April 15 deadline.
   ``If soldiers can't be expected to obtain and complete all their
necessary paperwork in a foreign desert, they shouldn't be
penalized by their government,'' Dole said.
   The Kansas senator made the announcement after the Internal
Revenue Service noted that any member of the armed services serving
in the Persian Gulf on April 15 would automatically have an
additional 60 days to file a return and pay any tax due.
   However, the agency said it had no authority to waive interest
charges on taxes not paid by the filing deadline. Dole's bill would
provide that authority.
   The IRS said most of the military personnel, like three-quarters
of all Americans, will be due refunds and would not face the
prospect of paying interest.

<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 10th graf, `The beam...' to clarify how air affects
visibility.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By NEIL BIBLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 6-mile-tall beam of turquoise light will stab
the sky, and laser images will cavort on fabric screens as a way
for this city to project a high-tech image and celebrate its
downtown revival.
   In a ceremony Saturday night, Mayor Paul Johnson is scheduled to
touch a console to publicly open a permanent laser show in Patriots
Square Park.
   After the weekend festival ends, anyone with 25 cents will be
able to manipulate the beam or activate random selections from up
to 150 computer-driven images.
   The 2.1-acre park is in the city's civic center, near where a
new high-rise commercial block called the Arizona Center already is
bringing new life downtown for the first time in years.
   But it is the laser action that boosters see as the crown of
downtown renewal.
   ``What this evolved into,'' said architect Ted Alexander, the
park and laser concept's creator, ``was a very strong statement
stylistically for Phoenix, a Number 1 entrepreneurial hotbed. This
symbolizes Phoenix as a high-tech city that looks to the future.''
   The park caps a five-level underground parking garage - a
combined $15.4 million project that began in 1981 and officially
opened in December 1988.
   The laser portion - delayed by City Council's reluctance to
provide financing - cost $355,000, half of it in donations, and
will take an estimated $40,000 a year to keep up.
   One laser can be moved to slice the sky from the vertical to the
near-horizontal, though one high-rise north of the park limits the
effect in that direction.
   The beam ranges in width from 3 to 5 feet. Visibility depends on
the air - particles of dust and moisture help reflect the light.
   The other laser operation projects images on one of the five
sail-like triangular screens intermeshed with the park's 115-foot
central spire of steel rings and rods.
   These images - holiday messages, representational shapes like
ornaments, submarines and spaceships, and abstract designs - can be
made to zoom larger or smaller, stretch or fatten, spin and tumble
and flicker.
   Alexander and former Mayor Terry Goddard say the laser show can
come to symbolize Phoenix, a desert city of sometimes searing heat
that has as its logo the fable fire bird rising from ashes.
   It can be ``our own version of the arch in St. Louis or the
Space Needle in Seattle,'' said Goddard, the Democratic candidate
in Arizona's still-contested gubernatorial election.
   Like Alexander Eiffel's tower in Paris, the park's spire debuted
to critics' sneers. One called the park ``a boil that needs to be
lanced.'' Even Goddard suggested the evolving park looked like a
landing pad for UFOs.
   ``We're trying to create a symbol here that reflects Phoenix's
growth,'' Alexander said during the earlier stages. ``And anytime
you make a bold statement for a community, there's no way to please
everybody.''
   Alexander spent six months studying what makes urban spaces work
before he began his redesign of what was a grassy area crisscrossed
by concrete walkways with a fountain where transients bathed.
   The new park has about 160 trees, lighted low columns of glass
bricks and curving rose-brick planters and walls. Every horizontal
surface is designed for sitting, making the park popular for office
workers' lunches. At its heart is a 45-foot-high dome shading an
800-seat amphitheater.
   The park, was designed ``to delight the spirit,'' Alexander
said.
   At night, the glass-brick columns and white globes atop twisted
lamp poles add illumination to the glow of colored lights and the
sparkle of fountains.
   The argon lasers, though powerful beams of light, won't slice
the wings off planes, skewer people or punch holes in nearby
buildings, Alexander says.
   The beams are computer-controlled to stay above the skyline, but
even if a beam dipped out of control it would do no more than cast
shadows, officials say.
   ``The heat dissipates very quickly as a function of distance,''
Alexander said. ``You'd have a real hard time lighting a cigarette
at 10 feet.''
   And the beam will be shut off by a technician if a plane flies
within 500 to 1,000 feet, he added.
   ``It will not shine into people's homes, nor will it light up
the night sky and interfere with astronomers,'' Alexander said.
``It reflects Phoenix ready for the 21st century.''

   The Keating Five hearings are supposed to be
focused on ethics, not cigars. So why was Senate Ethics Committee
Chairman Howell Heflin holding up that four-pack of cheap stogies?
   Heflin, D-Ala., was simply comparing his cheap cigars to the
$91.45 cigar bill on the tab at a dinner attended by former chief
savings and loan regulator Edwin J. Gray.
   The cigar issue was raised by William Taylor III, attorney for
Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif. He was demonstrating that Gray and
other regulators were wined and dined with thrift industry money.
One dinner bill for Gray and others totaled $1,158.63, including
the amount for cigars.
   Committee special counsel Robert S. Bennett piped up that
chairman Heflin also liked good cigars. Heflin responded by showing
everyone his lowly smokes.
   ---
   An insight into big thinking in fund raising was provided at one
point by Cranston, one of the five senators whose conduct in
connection with major contributor Charles H. Keating Jr., the
former savings and loan owner, is being investigated. The other
four senators are Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.; Donald W. Riegle Jr.,
D-Mich.; John Glenn, D-Ohio, and John McCain, R-Ariz.
   In a written deposition released by the committee, Cranston
said:
   ``Many people trying to raise money can never bring themselves
to ask for really large amounts. Yet, for those you are soliciting,
it's a compliment, a compliment to ask someone for a large sum. If
they're capable of giving big and you ask small, some potential
donors will be insulted.''
   Referring to Keating, Cranston said, ``You know he's given
lavishly to others; you don't ask a guy like him for peanuts and
you ask frequently.''
   However, at another point, Cranston lamented, ``Personally and
politically, I wish to God I'd never heard of Charles Keating.''
   ---
   Several references have been made to Keating's contributions to
the famous advocate for the poor, Mother Teresa.
   The latest mention came when Cranston fund-raiser Joy Jacobson
was explaining that it wasn't unusual for a conservative Republican
- Keating - to contribute to voter projects that registered the
poor, even though they might be expected to vote most often for
Democrats. After all, she said, Keating gave to Mother Teresa.
   Bennett said, ``I'm beginning to feel I'm going to have to call
the mother as a witness.'' He paused, then added, ``As of right
now, I don't intend to.''
   ---
   Five of the six committee members are Southerners: Heflin; Trent
Lott, R-Miss.; David Pryor,k.; Terry Sanford, D-N.C. and Jesse
Helms, R-N.C. Heflin, who usually speaks in a slow drawl, told one
fast-talking witness to slow down.
   Committee Vice-Chairman Warren Rudman, R-N.H., who speaks at a
fast clip himself, told the witness he could understand him just
fine.
   ---
   The hearings have featured several alumni of the U.S. attorney's
office in Washington. Charles F. C. Ruff, representing Glenn, was
the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia. His assistant in
the ethics case, Carol E. Bruce, was an assistant U.S. attorney who
specialized in prosecuting terrorists. Bennett also is a former
assistant U.S. attorney. So is Raymond Banoun, who represented
witness M. Danny Wall, the chief thrift regulator after Gray left
office.
   ---
   The hearing also features former journalists including Gray;
Bennett's assistant, Amy Sabrin, and Cranston, who covered events
in England, Germany, Italy and Ethiopia in 1937-38 for the old
International News Service.
   ---
   Heflin and Rudman have several times chided defense lawyers for
their lengthy questioning of witnesses. So when Riegle's lawyer,
Thomas Green, began cross-examination of a witness 10 minutes
before one day's adjournment, he began with a preemptive strike.
   ``You just give me the hook when it's time to go here,'' Green
told Heflin. Heflin did, 10 minutes later, just as Green was
working himself up to a fever pitch to confront a witness.

   The Iraqi parliament today overwhelmingly endorsed Saddam
Hussein's decision to free thousands of Western hostages, meaning
the 900 Americans held captive in Iraq and Kuwait might be home for
Christmas.
   The more than 8,000 Westerners, East Europeans and Japanese
stranded in Iraq will be allowed to leave beginning Saturday, Iraqi
officials said.
   Iraq said the hostages could start applying for exit visas
immediately. It said they would be flown on special Iraqi Airways
flights to Amman, Jordan.
   In Baghdad, a group of American and British hostages hugged and
kissed each other and raised beer mugs today to celebrate their
impending release.
   The State Department, meanwhile, said that once the Americans in
Kuwait have left, the eight diplomats in Kuwait City's U.S. Embassy
will be withdrawn. The embassy will remain open but unstaffed, and
the United States expects the Iraqis to safeguard the empty
premises, the State Department said.
   Iraq had surrounded the embassy and cut off its supplies, making
the diplomats virtual prisoners and angering the Bush
administration. But State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said that once American civilians have left Kuwait, the embassy
``will have fulfilled its major remaining task.''
   U.S. officials also said today that Baghdad has sent 30,000 more
troops to the Arabian desert in recent days, indicating Baghdad has
no intention of abandoning Kuwait, which it invaded on Aug. 2.
   Pentagon spokesman Bob Hall said the troop reinforcements
brought the Iraqi buildup in Kuwait and southern Iraq to 480,000
soldiers.
   An additional 10,000 U.S. troops have also arrived in the
Persian Gulf, Hall said. The 350,000-strong multinational force now
includes about 250,000 Americans, most of them dug into the Saudi
Arabian desert facing Iraqi troops.
   President Bush has said 440,000 American soldiers will be in the
gulf by mid-January. The U.N. resolution approved last week
authorizes the use of force to drive Iraq from Kuwait if Baghdad
has not withdrawn by Jan. 15.
   Saddam on Thursday instructed his rubber-stamp parliament to
free the captives, saying he no longer needed them to deter attack.
He said his troops were fully deployed in Kuwait, seized in a
dispute over oil, land and money.
   ``Iraqi armed forces should maintain the highest degree of alert
and vigilance,'' Saddam said, ``because the forces of aggression
remain on our sacred soil in Saudi Arabia, fanning the flames of
fire.''
   At Baghdad's Mansour-Melia Hotel a group of 50 American and
British hostages toasted their release by the Iraqi parliament.
   ``This is it. We're all free,'' one hostage shouted when a
reporter told him of the parliament vote.
   Robert Vinton, a businessman from Santa Fe, N.M., said: ``It is
a monumental occasion.''
   Bush welcomed Saddam's decision Thursday to free Americans and
other foreigners in Kuwait and Iraq, but said the United States
must still demand withdrawal. ``We've got to continue to keep the
pressure on,'' he said.
   Prime Minister John Major of Britain said he hoped the hostages
would be coming home soon with no conditions placed on their
departure. But ``Saddam Hussein has a lot more to do in terms of
U.N. Security Council resolutions and the international community
will require him to do it all,'' he said.
   In Saudi Arabia, U.S. troops also had a message for Saddam: It's
great the hostages may be home for Christmas but the GIs are not
prepared to go home until Kuwait is free.
   First Sgt. Jerry Carlton, 37, of Warsaw, N.C., said the hostage
release could signal Saddam was caving in, or be an effort ``to buy
additional time.''
   First Lt. Brian Ratchford, 26, of Spartanburg, S.C., said: ``I
think it's great they're going home ... But it's not about the
hostages. I think the hostages were a bad side effect of this whole
thing.''
   Iraq's National Assembly has no record of vetoing decisions by
Saddam, but reporters counted 18 of 250 delegates voting today
against Saddam's request. The assembly speaker, Sadi Mehdi Saleh,
said he counted only 15 hands.
   ``Definitely, we would like to see everyone with his family by
Christmas, because that is a very joyous and happy occasion, and it
is time for family reunions,'' said Iraq's ambassador to the United
Nations, Abdul Amir al-Anbari.
   A British Airways jet stocked with champagne left London for the
gulf today to pick up hostages. Planes were also being prepared in
Denmark and Japan, while Dutch officials said they didn't expect to
send a flight until next week.
   Among the foreigners who have been barred from leaving Iraq are
about 90 Americans and hundreds of others held as ``human shields''
at military and other strategic sites. Many more have remained in
hiding.
   In a message for broadcast to the region over Voice of America,
the U.S. State Department said that until Iraq made clear how such
releases take place, ``Stay where you are, stay in touch with the
U.S. Embassy and monitor the VOA closely. We will let you know as
soon as we have more information.''
   The British Foreign Office, meanwhile, also advised Britons in
hiding in Kuwait to stay there.
   ``Basically, the situation is still unclear,'' a Foreign Office
spokesman said. ``The ambassador is obviously in close touch with
Iraqi authorities to clarify what will happen, but until plans
become more clear we are advising people to stay where they are.''
   Out of an estimated 3 million foreigners in the two countries
before the invasion, about 2 million are still left, most of them
Asians and Arabs who had the option of leaving.
   The U.N. Security Council may meet today to discuss a U.N. draft
resolution that approves a world conference on the Palestinian
problem.
   Bush, who is touring South America, said his administration did
not support any immediate Middle East peace conference, renewing
his rejection of Saddam's attempt to link resolution of the crisis
with the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   Washington has said, however, it approves in principle the idea
of a peace conference, at an ``appropriate'' time. Diplomats have
said that because of a possible appearance of linkage with Kuwait,
now is not an appropriate time.

   Grenada's prime minister would like another
invasion by Americans. But this time, he wants them carrying
beachbags and cameras instead of rucksacks and automatic rifles.
   ``Grenada's economic future depends considerably on tourism,''
Nicholas Brathwaite said in a interview during the 14th annual
Conference on the Caribbean, which ended Friday.
   He said his government is looking to tourism as the quickest way
to get badly needed foreign exchange and give jobs to thousands of
unemployed youths.
   The days when the verdant island of 100,000 people was worldwide
news are gone. Now Brathwaite, who steered the island's transition
to democracy six years ago, is back as its elected leader and
facing an economic mess.
   Brathwaite, a former educator, headed the interim government
installed after the Oct. 25, 1983, U.S. invasion overthrew a
radical military junta that had seized power in a bloody split of
the leftists who had staged a 1979 coup.
   He had returned to private life after a government was elected a
year later, but he headed the winning Grenada National Congress in
elections last March after Prime Minister Herbert Blaize's death.
   During the same month, he concluded that the island's economy
was in bad shape. A recent International Monetary Fund-World Bank
study team found the budget deficit and debt-servicing problems
were staggering, he said.
   ``We were not aware of the true magnitude of the problem,'' he
said.
   Grenada's year-end economic report for 1989 showed a $48.7
million foreign debt, $35.9 million domestic debt, a trade deficit
of $59.7 million and 20 percent unemployment.
   Grenada's hopes of increasing tourism, which has traditionally
lagged behind most other Caribbean islands, has been helped by the
recent inauguration of regular flights from the United States.
   The island, which has a 10,000-foot runway airport largely built
by the past leftist government's Cuban allies, is working on
broadening its tourist appeal beyond its myriad white-sand beaches,
Brathwaite said. The government hopes to develop nature trails into
its mountainous rain forests, he said.
   Brathwaite said the high esteem most Grenadians had for
Americans after the invasion has barely ebbed.
   ``There were high expectations, and there have been some
disappointments since, but I think Grenadians realize the problems
have been with their own government. The United States helped a lot
with infrastructure,'' he said.
   Overwhelmingly, he said, Grenadians have warm feelings toward
Americans. The U.S. government still sends $110 million a year in
aid to Grenada.

   Bangladesh's interim president said
Friday he is rescinding the emergency powers that ousted President
Hussain Muhammad Ershad gave himself in an unsuccessful effort to
save his collapsing regime.
   Shahabuddin Ahmed, the former Supreme Court chief justice who
took power when Ershad resigned Thursday, also said he will move
quickly to set up Bangladesh's first free parliamentary election in
a decade.
   Ershad, who seized power in a 1982 coup, resigned under pressure
following seven weeks of street protests led by university students
and opposition parties.
   An independent newspaper, The Bangladesh Observer, said at least
60 people were killed by police and government forces during the
protests. Opposition leaders said more than 100 died, while the
government admitted only six dead.
   Mosques were crowded on Friday for the weekly Moslem holiday and
shops were open as Dhaka, the capital city of seven million people,
began to resume an air of normalcy after almost two months of
protests.
   A committee of political leaders who led the campaign against
Ershad called on Ahmed to seize Ershad's passport, freeze his bank
accounts and put him on trial for corruption.
   The recently formed liaison committee of three former opposition
alliances accused Ershad of ``brutal killing, illegal use of arms
and misuse of power'' during his eight-year rule.
   It also charged him with ``illegally accumulating wealth,''
which he allegedly sent abroad.
   A statement released by the committee demanded the arrest of
Ershad's wife Raushan. Unlike the wives of previous statesman in
this Moslem country, Mrs. Ershad was a public figure who was widely
disliked for taking advantage of her position.
   ``We definitely want a trial of those who have committd crimes
and atrocities in the past eight years,'' said Khaleda Zia, an
opposition leader.
   Ahmed, in his first televised address to the nation, did not
respond directly to the appeal, and said his interim administration
would make no decisions on basic policies.
   ``The main task of my caretaker government will be to conduct a
free and fair election. The people will elect a parliament and my
duty will end after the parliament is formed,'' he said.
   Ahmed said he would appoint a council to help him administer the
country until elections, which should be held within 90 days. None
of the members of the caretaker council will be allowed to stand
for election, he said.
   He said that within 24 hours he would sign the ordinance
repealing the Special Powers Act, which Ershad invoked Nov. 27 when
he declared a state of emergency.
   The laws suspended personal liberties and empowered the
government to make arrests without pressing charges.
   Ershad lifted the emergency restrictions and dissolved
Parliament shortly before he resigned on Thursday.
   Also to be rescinded are other controversial laws which allowed
the regime to arbitrarily close universities and to change the
structure of health services, Ahmed said in his 10-minute speech.
   He praised the armed forces, which he said ``made a commendable
contribution to the democratic movement by showing respect for the
hopes and aspirations of the people.''
   Sources said senior army officers helped persuade Ershad to bow
to the public demands for his resignation.
   Ahmed called on the military to help maintain order for
elections, which in the past have often turned violent.
   Ershad held parliamentary elections twice during his regime.
Opposition parties boycotted the 1988 election, and the 1986 vote
was widely regarded as rigged by Ershad's Jatiya party.
   Bangladesh, formerly East Pakistan, became independent in a
civil war with West Pakistan in 1971. Until Ershad took power it
was ruled by a succession of presidents installed by the military.

   A 20-year-old Army private was accidentally
crushed to death by an Army truck in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, the
Pentagon said Friday.
   The victim was identified as Dustin Craig LaMoureaux, of
Bremerton, Wash. He was deployed to the Persian Gulf with the 20th
Engineer Brigade of Fort Bragg, N.C., as part of Operation Desert
Shield.
   The accident occurred about 6 p.m. local time on Wednesday.
While participating in a construction project, LaMoureaux was
crushed between the truck and a pallet of construction materials,
the Pentagon said. The incident is being investigated.
   His was the 48th accidental death in Desert Shield.
   The Pentagon also said it has determined that the previously
reported death Tuesday in Saudi Arabia of Lt. Col. Joe Hancock, a
Tennessee National Guard commander, was a suicide. Hancock died of
a gunshot wound while in his tent.
   The Pentagon said there have been three Desert Shield deaths due
to natural causes and one earlier suicide.

   President Hosni Mubarak's ruling party won
an overwhelming majority in violence-marred parliamentary
elections, according to final results released Friday.
   A second round of voting was held Thursday. Figures announced by
the Interior Ministry and reported by the government-run Middle
East News Agency gave the governing National Democratic Party 348
out of the 444 seats being contested in the People's Assembly.
   The small leftist National Unionist Progressive Party won six
seats and independent candidates took 83.
   The ministry's statement said elections for seven seats will be
repeated in four districts because of irregularities. It said the
date would be announced later.
   At least 10 people were reported killed and close to 100 wounded
in clashes related to the two rounds of voting. Trouble in
Thursday's runoff round, some involving police, left at least five
dead and 54 wounded.
   Major opposition parties boycotted the vote, charging that a new
election law lacked adequate guarantees of free balloting.
   Some National Democrats who were not chosen by their party as
candidates also ran as independents. The final results show that
the seats they won were counted in favor of the ruling party, even
though they ran as independents.
   In the first election round on Nov. 29, independents won 38
seats.
   Runoffs were necessary for almost 60 percent of the seats, a
record for a parliamentary election, beacuse almost 2,700
candidates ran. Candidates who failed to get a first-round majority
had to face a second round.
   Mubarak, riding a crest of popularity because of his strong
stand against Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, opens the new Parliament
on Dec. 15 with a keynote adress expected to focus on the Persian
Gulf crisis.
   The National Democrats controlled more than 350 seats in the
outgoing parliament, which had 458 seats.
   Only 13 women ran in this election, the smallest number in
republican Egypt's 34-year history. Five won in the first round,
but it was not clear how many were elected in the second.

<HEAD>18 Cities Search for School Superintendents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Despite generous perks and salaries often exceeding $100,000, 18
of the nation's largest school districts are trying to fill
superintendencies - jobs educators increasingly see as ``doomed to
failure.''
   Urban superintendents are quitting, or being fired, in droves
because they are expected to perform miracles, fail to do so, then
get blamed by politicians, business heads, parents, and
increasingly meddlesome school boards.
   The average tenure of big-city superintendents is now only 2.5
years, compared with nearly five years in the 1970s, said Samuel
Husk, executive director of the Council of Great City Schools in
Washington, D.C.
   ``Part of it is our fault. I think superintendents tend to agree
they can do everything, then the house of cards falls when they
can't deliver,'' said San Francisco's Ramon Cortines. Cortines
plans to step down as superintendent in August, two years before
his contract expires.
   Budget pressures are worsening the odds of reform and adding to
the job strains of big-city school chiefs, said superintendents and
educators interviewed this week.
   ``Urban centers are getting to the point where the job is
impossible. With the political climate, the dwindling financial
support and unrealistic expectations, you know when you go i that
you're doomed to failure,'' said Ken Underwood, president of Harold
Webb Associates, a Winnetka, Ill., search firm specializing in
placing school administrators.
   In an average year, six to eight major school districts find
themselves searching for new superintendents, according to Husk.
   But currently there are 18: Atlanta and Savannah, Ga.; Boston;
Detroit; Columbus and Toledo, Ohio; San Francisco; Austin, Houston
and El Paso, Texas; Indianapolis; Milwaukee; St. Louis and Kansas
City, Mo.; Hartford, Conn.; Tucson, Ariz; Charlotte-Mecklenburg,
N.C., and Washington, D.C.
   Webb and others say there are still enough good candidates to
fill the vacancies. But educators worry that it will become harder
to fill jobs that promise little security, and almost guarantee
failure.
   Salaries in districts with more than 25,000 students averaged
$95,735 in the 1989-90 school year, according to the Educational
Research Service, a private, non-profit firm in Arlington, Va. Many
offer generous annuities, housing allowances and pensions.
   Salaries in several of those top $100,000: $125,000 in Houston,
$116,000 in San Francisco, $112,000 in Atlanta, $110,000 in
Milwaukee, $109,180 in Austin, Texas, $109,000 in Detroit, and
$101,237 in St. Louis.
   But more and more urban superintendents seem to be saying that
no amount of pay can compensate jobs that are being made political
scapegoats for decades of urban school failure.
   -Six weeks ago, Memphis' Willie Herenton quit the $96,304
superintendency he'd held for 11 years because of disputes over
school funds.
   -Washington, D.C.'s board fired superintendent Andrew Jenkins
last week. He accused school board members of going around him in
dealing with teachers and others on curriculum and other matters.
   -San Francisco's Cortines said board interference in personnel
matters was one reason he had decided to quit by August, though his
contract runs through 1993.
   -In Boston this week, the city council voted to abolish the
school committee after a fruitless six-month search to replace
outgoing superintendent Laval Wilson.
   Wilson, who is black, was fired from the $95,000 Boston post
last February just weeks after the school committee had given him a
highly favorable job evaluation. Supporters contend race played a
role in his dismissal.
   ``The people who have the background in the trenches don't seem
to be giving up on the possibilities,'' said Jeremiah Floyd,
associate executive director of the National Association of
Secondary School Principals.
   ``They just know that once you take on the mission, you have to
do it in a hurry, because the longevity is not there at all.''

   Bad weather won't be par for the course once
a domed golf course is finished, but inclement conditions have
proved to be a bogey for its scheduled opening.
   Michael Thompson, president of American Golf Domes Inc., the
company building Turfdome-One, said Friday the covered links
probably will be ready by Dec. 20. The opening originally was set
for next Monday.
   ``We have to inflate the bubble, and everything has to be
absolutely perfect,'' Thompson said.
   The $2 million Turfdome-One is a nine-hole course with a dozen
sand traps and hills up to 12 feet high. Its longest hole is about
75 yards, and all nine will be separated by nets.
   Thompson said his company worked with Michigan State University
to develop a system allowing grass to grow under the dome. He said
the turf is a hybrid of rye and bent grasses. A special underground
heating system and dome material letting in 71 percent of the sun's
ultraviolet rays will be used.
   The course will be open 8 a.m. to 9 p.m., seven days a week,
from December through April.
   Golfers will be allowed to carry only four clubs per bag. Spike
shoes will be banned.
   Two more nine-hole courses and a driving range of artificial
turf are planned for the site next year, Thompson said.

   Arizona Gov. Rose Mofford defended Sen. Dennis
DeConcini at ethics hearings Friday, testifying that his help for
Charles H. Keating Jr. came when the businessman was held in high
esteem.
   Mofford, who knew the Arizona Democrat as a 10-year-old altar
boy, was a character witness for DeConcini - one of five senators
under investigation for their intervention on behalf of former S&amp;L
owner Keating.
   She testified Keating was ``considered a very successful
businessman and very charitable'' in 1987, when the senators
discussed his complaints with thrift regulators.
   Keating's American Continental Corp. of Phoenix, parent of
California-based Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, employed
3,500 people in 1987, Ms. Mofford said. The corporation was a major
lender in Arizona and considered a solid company in which to
invest.
   Federal regulators closed Lincoln, a failure that's expected to
cost taxpayers $2.3 billion.
   The committee is trying to learn whether the $1.3 million raised
for the five senators by Keating and associates influenced the
conduct of DeConcini or Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., Donald W.
Riegle Jr., D-Mich., John Glenn, D-Ohio, and Alan Cranston,
D-Calif.
   A theme in the defense of all five senators is that they
provided normal constituent service to Keating, who complained that
Lincoln was unfairly treated by thrift regulators.
   ``His work with constituencies certainly was a hallmark'' of
DeConcini's career, Mofford said.
   ``A problem was never too big or too small,'' she said. ``Any
time there was a problem with the federal government, everyone
would say, `Call Dennis DeConcini's office.'''
   One of DeConcini's accomplishments, Mofford said, was getting
President Bush's anti-drug coordinator, William Bennett, to make
the Arizona-Mexico border a high priority area for drug
interdiction.
   Bennett, recently named Republican national chairman, is the
brother of Robert S. Bennett - the Ethics Committee's special
counsel in the Keating case.
   After Mofford's testimony, which lasted less than 20 minutes,
the hearings adjourned until Monday.

<TEXT>
   When army jeeps approach
this hilltop Palestinian village, old women blow a warning with
whistles hanging from their necks. Wanted men slip into hiding, and
iron courtyard gates slam shut.
   After three years, the uprising against Israeli rule has become
a way of life for the 1.7 million Palestinians in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Many are exhausted by the daily hardships, disappointed that
their struggle has brought no political gains, and aware that the
Persian Gulf crisis has overshadowed their revolt.
   But most say there is no turning back.
   ``The world has heard our voice and we must continue,'' said
Amal, a 27-year-old woman from Kufr Nama whose quiet village life
was turned upside down by the revolt that erupted on Dec. 9, 1987.
   A day earlier, four Arabs had been killed in a crash with an
Israeli truck. Rumors spread that the accident was intentional, and
the violence escalated after that.
   Before the uprising, Amal's husband Nassif, 29, worked in an
Israeli aluminum factory and made enough money for such luxuries as
fancy dresses for their two daughters, ages 3 and 5.
   Today, Nassif is an activist on the run from the army, sleeping
in the hills at night and sneaking home only briefly. He raises
chickens, barely eking out a living.
   Amal, who is pregnant, said she lies awake many nights worrying
about her absent husband. ``I always expect a knock at the door
thinking it's the army,'' she said.
   Her fears are not without reason. In the stone houses along Kufr
Nama's steep, winding streets, hardly a family has been untouched
by the intefadeh - Arabic for uprising.
   The village, 10 miles northwest of Jerusalem, has 2,500
residents. Two have been killed and 50 wounded by troops, one has
been deported and some 200 have been jailed.
   The story is much the same throughout the West Bank and Gaza. In
the last three years, more than 770 Palestinians have been killed
by Israelis and about 300 others have been slain by fellow Arabs,
mostly as suspected informers. Fifty-two Israelis have died in the
violence.
   At least 60,000 Palestinians have been jailed at one time or
another in the uprising. In mid-November, 10,009 were in custody,
including 790 held under emergency regulations allowing detention
for up to a year without charges.
   The army also has demolished or sealed 620 Palestinian homes to
punish suspected militants, ignoring Western protests that the
practice violates human rights.
   Today, the massive demonstrations of the uprising's early days
have shrunk to small, stone-throwing attacks on soldiers. Deaths
and injuries are fewer.
   Lately, in fact, more Palestinians have been killed as
collaborators by fellow Arabs than have been slain by soldiers.
   A senior military official said that after three years, the army
is better prepared for uprising riots. Army jeeps are protected by
steel mesh, and soldiers often avoid such obvious hot spots as
mosques and schools.
   ``The uprising is by no means over, but we have taken a lot of
steam out of it,'' said the official, who cannot be named under
military rules.
   To try to prevent violence linked to the uprising's third
anniversary over the weekend, the army beefed up its forces in the
occupied territories Friday and confined more than 735,000 Arabs to
their homes.
   Lately, the most fearful aspect of the revolt for Israelis has
been a wave of stabbing attacks that followed the Oct. 8 Temple
Mount riots in Jerusalem, in which 17 Palestinians died in police
gunfire.
   Israelis responded to the stabbings with revenge attacks of
their own, and demands that Palestinians be blocked from working in
Israel. Authorities say they expect to deny working permits to more
than half the 110,000 Palestinians with jobs in Israel.
   The move comes as Israel is trying to find work for thousands of
newly arrived Soviet Jewish immigrants. But some Israelis argue
that denying jobs to Palestinians already bitter and frustrated by
Israel's occupation could backfire into more violence.
   ``We have passed from the era of the stones to the era of
knives. I'm afraid that soon we'll reach the era of guns,'' said
Israeli lawmaker Yossi Sarid of the liberal Citizens' Rights
Movement.
   For their part, the Palestinians admit to being discouraged by
diminished hopes for peace.
   Israel's new government, formed last June, is dominated by
right-wingers who oppose giving up any of the land Israel captured
in the 1967 Middle East war. Palestinians also have lost
international sympathy by supporting Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
in the gulf crisis.
   Uprising leaders say their job now is to make a reality of the
Palestinian state proclaimed on paper by the Palestine Liberation
Organization's parliament-in-exile on Nov. 15, 1988.
   In Kufr Nama, Nassif and his friends are working toward economic
independence by organizing the village's more than 100 chicken
farmers, who provide most of its income, into a cooperative.
   The three years of revolt have also allowed young activists to
smash the rule of traditional clan leaders. Kufr Nama is now run by
a ``popular committee'' of the four major PLO factions, who mediate
land disputes and organize defense against army raids.
   Elderly women in Palestinian embroidered dresses are the early
warning system. They watch the two winding roads into town and
listen for sounds of military convoys, blowing their whistles at
any sign of trouble.

   First they were accused of stealing somebody
else's voice. Now they're accused of stealing somebody's melody.
   Lip synchers Milli Vanilli are being sued for alleged copyright
infringement by Blood, Sweat and Tears' David Clayton-Thomas.
   Clayton-Thomas says the melody of the song ``Spinning Wheel,''
which he wrote in 1968, was used without his permission in ``All or
Nothing'' from Milli Vanilli's hit album ``Girl You Know It's
True.''
   ``This suit is about the song they didn't write on the album
they didn't sing,'' said Clayton-Thomas' lawyer, Robert Marcus.
   The duo, Rob Pilatus and Fabrice Morvan, were forced to give
back a Grammy they won for best new artist after it was revealed
they did not sing the album's songs and were lip-synching the words
in concerts.
   The suit, filed Thursday, seeks $120 million and names as
defendants Pilatus, Morvan, producer Frank Farian and EMI Music
Publishing Inc., which holds Clayton-Thomas' music copyrights in
trust.
   EMI executive vice president Harold Rosenbloom did not return a
call seeking comment.
   The whereabouts of Farian, Pilatus and Morvan were not
immediately known. A call to Arista Records, where the album was
recorded, was referred to lawyer Michael Pollock, who did not
return messages.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Actor Corey Feldman's latest run-in with the
law is over traffic tickets.
   The 19-year-old star of the movies ``The Lost Boys,''
``Gremlins'' and ``Stand By Me'' was arrested late Thursday, said
Sgt. Pat Findley of the Los Angeles Police Department's Hollywood
division.
   Officers had spotted his BMW blocking a driveway and discovered
there was an outstanding traffic warrant for his arrest, Findley
said. They also determined that Feldman had a suspended driver's
licens, Findley said.
   Feldman was released early Friday after paying $528 in
outstanding tickets and fines, Findley said.
   He was to appear in Los Angeles Traffic Court on Jan. 2, the
sergeant said.
   It was Feldman's third arrest this year. On March 9, officers
said they found balloons containing heroin and cocaine in his car.
   Feldman also was arrested Sept. 20 in connection with unpaid
traffic tickets. Officers said they found a small amount of heroin
on him during a search at a North Hollywood police station and the
actor underwent drug treatment.

   LONDON (AP) - Actress Joan Collins says she wants people to see
her play roles other than ``the glamorous vixen type,'' so she's
filming eight Noel Coward comedies for British television.
   Collins is best known for playing the decidedly vixenish Alexis
Carrington Colby on the TV series ``Dynasty.'' She currently is
starring in a London stage production of Coward's ``Private
Lives.''
   ``I don't always want to be perceived as the glamorous vixen
type,'' Collins said.
   The television project, entitled ``Tonight At 8:30,'' will begin
airing in April on the British Broadcasting Corp., Collins told
reporters Friday.
   The new series will cast her in roles that range from a fading
music hall star to an elegant femme fatale.
   ``I've been an actress for a very long time,'' she said. ``I'm
quite adventurous. I love challenges.''
   Once the project is done, Collins said, she hopes to return to
the stage, taking ``Private Lives'' to Broadway next fall. Its
London run ends Jan. 26.

   CHICAGO (AP) - A rocker used by Barbara Bush fetched $60 at a
charity auction. A chair once used by Madonna got $225. And an
orange plastic stadium seat once thrown by Indiana University
basketball coach Bob Knight sold for $150.
   Thursday night's celebrity furniture auction raised $5,085 for
the non-profit Greater Chicago Food Depository, which distributes
20 million pounds of food a year to 500 soup kitchens, pantries and
shelters in northeast Illinois and northwest Indiana.
   ``I was amazed. I didn't think we'd do so well,'' said
auctioneer Leslie Hindman, who held the event in a fifth-floor
gallery of her downtown Antique Center. ``You can never tell how it
will go with a charity auction.''

   The army sent reinforcements to the occupied
lands Friday and imposed military curfews on towns and villages in
an effort to thwart attacks marking the third anniversary of the
Palestinian uprising.
   Underground uprising leaders called a two-day general strike for
the weekend, and a Marxist PLO faction, the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, urged ``massive martyrdom'' to mark the
anniversary.
   ``The Palestinians in the West Bank have every good reason now
to carry out spectacular attacks in the territories,'' a senior
army officer was quoted as saying in the Maariv newspaper.
   ``The prime minister is in the United States, (U.S. Secretary of
State James A.) Baker is about to meet with the president of Iraq,
the third anniversary of the uprising is approaching, and there is
a feeling that because of the gulf crisis the uprising has been
removed from the headlines,'' the unidentified officer was quoted
as saying.
   An army spokesman said reinforcements have been sent into the
West Bank and Gaza Strip and that ``special measures,'' including
covert operations, were ordered to thwart violence.
   The army also clamped curfews on the largest of the territories'
towns - Gaza City, Nablus and Hebron - and many refugee camps. It
declared other sectors ``closed military areas,'' barring
journalists from entering.
   The curfews essentially mean that an estimated 735,000
Palestinians living in those areas are ordered to stay home.
   The strike Saturday was called to mark two months since the
Temple Mount riots in which at least 17 Palestinians were killed by
Israeli police. Uprising leaders said the second day of the strike
would mark the anniversary of the uprising - which broke out Dec.
9, 1987.
   The results of a newly published poll, meanwhile, showed that
the uprising has made 42 percent of Israelis more hawkish. It said
opinion was divided on how to solve the conflict.
   The survey of 1,200 Israeli Jews said only 6 percent had become
more dovish, while 25 percent had experienced no change of opinion.
Seven percent were undecided, according to the poll conducted by
the Smith Research Center for the weekly Jerusalem Report news
magazine.
   On the question of how to solve the conflict, 21 percent wanted
to expel all or some of the Palestinians from the territories, and
20 percent thought Israel should withdraw from the Gaza Strip,
regarded as the most troublesome occupied area.
   Twenty-five percent favored some sort of statehood for the 1.7
million Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza, the poll said. Six
percent favored annexing the West Bank, 9 percent opted for
preserving the present situation, and 19 percent had no opinion, it
said.
   Since the uprising began, 776 Palestinians have been killed by
Israeli soldiers or civilians. Fifty-three Israelis have died in
the violence.
   In addition, 316 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs,
most on suspicion of collaboration with Israel.

   Columbia's astronauts, with help
from scientists on the ground, pushed forward with their stargazing
Friday in a rush to make as many observations as possible with the
shuttle's telescopes.
   The four astronomers aboard Columbia talked about their problems
operating the $150 million Astro observatory during a live lesson
from space for middle school students and a question-and-answer
session.
   ``Unfortunately, we've had some failures with computer terminals
which have caused us to have to redo the way that we operate this
mission. So it's been quite tedious and time-consuming to figure
out how to do that,'' astronaut Ron Parise told 41 youngsters at
NASA centers in Alabama and Maryland.
   ``But we're slowly working around everything and we're getting
science data and doing our job,'' Parise said.
   Added astronaut Jeffrey Hoffman, ``We've shown that in space
flight you have to be extremely adaptable and be able to
accommodate things that fail and ways of operating which we never
even planned before.''
   Observations were halted for half a day Thursday when a flight
deck computer overheated and shut down. The only other on-board
computer for operating Astro's three ultraviolet telecopes failed
in a similar manner Sunday.
   Lint, probably from clothing worn by the seven-man crew, was
found clogging the air vents of the computer that failed Sunday.
After the lint was removed Thursday, the terminal was turned on but
immediately turned off when a burning odor once again filled the
cabin.
   Flight director Bob Castle said it was not known whether the
lint was the cause of the problem and whether that made the other
computer fail. The lint will be analyzed after the flight to
determine its source, he said.
   Following Thursday's failure, NASA hurriedly devised and
implemented a plan in which ground teams aim and turn on the
telescopes, with the astronauts using a joystick to zero in on the
targets. The telescopes were tested successfully one by one and by
Friday were producing results surpassing scientists' expectations.
   Parise and fellow astronaut Robert Parker, for example, focused
all three telescopes on a quasar for 51 minutes, three minutes
longer than planned.
   ``That's what happens when you have good, old-fashioned
astronomy ... and a little bit of help from your friends,'' Parker
told Spacelab Mission Operations Control in Huntsville, Ala.
   Other high-energy targets observed Friday included numerous
galaxies and a supernova that exploded in 1987.
   Arthur Davidsen of Johns Hopkins University, principal
investigator of one of the telescopes, said the results demonstrate
``this is not a failure by any stretch of anybody's imagination.''
He likened the 10-day mission to a football game.
   When the second computer failed, ``we went in and changed the
game plan entirely ... and now we're making so much progress it's
unbelievable. Almost every play is a first down,'' Davidsen said.
``I think we're winning this game now.''
   Some scientists, includng Barbara Pfarr of the ultraviolet
imaging telescope team, even were enjoying the new method of
operation because of their increased participation.
   ``Commanding from the ground is rather fun,'' she said.
   One of the more exciting findings of the day came from Astro's
X-ray telescope, which was unaffected by the computer problems. The
instrument has its own pointing system and is controlled by
computer commands sent from Goddard Space Flight Center in
Greenbelt, Md.
   Goddard scientist Peter Serlemitsos, the X-ray telescope's
principal investigator, said he found conditions to be right for a
black hole to exist in a Seyfert galaxy - one with a bright,
compact center - 325 million light years away. That, in turn,
``tells us that indeed there are likely to be giant black holes at
the centers of these galaxies,'' he said.
   The mission, which ends Tuesday, has been plagued by instrument
problems since Columbia blasted off Sunday. In addition to the
failed computers, the crew has had to contend with a faulty
instrument pointing system.
   Because the astronauts had to manually steer the ultraviolet
telescopes rather than use the automatic pointing system, only 70
of 187 observations were accomplished before Thursday's computer
failure, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said.
   Scientists had hoped to study about 250 objects, including some
of the hottest, most violent stars in the universe. Ultraviolet
light and X-rays emitted from such objects is absorbed by Earth's
atmosphere and thus invisible from the ground.
   Deputy mission scientist Gene Urban said it was not known how
many of the targets will have to be scrapped because of the delays.

<TEXT>
   David T. Best's journey to honor a childhood
friend killed 49 years ago at Pearl Harbor ended Friday at the
stark limestone facade of the Indiana World War Memorial.
   Best, 72, traveled from his Hayward, Calif., home to join other
World War II veterans at a service honoring the 2,403 Americans
killed in Japan's assault on the Pacific Fleet.
   Best glanced at a photograph of Paul B. Free, whose life ended
at 20 as he climbed into his airplane on Dec. 7, 1941.
   ``Few things stir man's compassion so deeply as remembering the
supreme sacrifice of an old buddy. Sleep, comrade, sleep in
peace,'' Best said.
   Veterans alternated reading 10 names a minute while tolling a
large, silver bell from the USS Indianapolis one time for each
American who died.
   Similar ceremonies took place elsewhere, including in Hawaii,
where dignitaries boarded the USS Arizona Memorial for wreath
presentations, a 21-gun salute and echo taps. At the Pearl Harbor
Naval Base, a ``missing man'' flyover by Hawaii Air National Guard
jets ended a minute of silence marking the time of the attack.
   Best, a self-described ``loyal, patriotic American who gets
choked up when `The Star-Spangled Banner' plays,'' grew up in
Williamsport, Pa., and returned there in 1988 to unveil a plaque
commemorating Free as the city's first resident killed in World War
II.
   ``We made a pact that he would enlist in the Army Air Corps and
I would try to get aviation experience. Of course, then he was
killed,'' said Best, who later trained B-17 radar bombardiers and
navigators in Florida.
   ``When I got the terse telegram (about Free's death), I was just
a 21-year-old kid. I was in shock, I didn't know how to cope. So
then I enlisted. I have never forgotten him, and I never will.''
   That was a feeling shared by about 100 people who stood in
28-degree weather as a bugler from Fort Benjamin Harrison in
Indianapolis played taps. Yellow ribbons decorated the bare
branches of trees around the monument on the downtown American
Legion Mall.
   The USS Indianapolis was sunk between Guam and the Philippines
by a Japanese submarine July 30, 1945, two days after it unloaded
parts and nuclear material used in the atomic bombs dropped on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The bell later was recovered from the ship.
   ``We're not here to refight the war or verbally bash the
Japanese. On a lovely Hawaiian morning 49 years ago, Americans who
saw the sun rise did not see it set,'' said the Rev. Russell
Blowers, minister of the 91st Street Christian Church and veteran
of the Eighth Air Force. ``With the tolling of the bell, remind us
that someday the bell will toll for us.''
   ``We are hoping this will lead to bells tolling all over the
country next year on the 50th anniversary,'' said Elbert Watson,
chairman of the World War II National Commemorative Association,
which sponsored Friday's service.
   Watson asked the Japanese government to apologize for the attack
that drew the United States into World War II. Some Japanese are
trying to persuade their leaders to apologize before President Bush
visits Japan next spring.
   Japan has apologized to South Korea and China for its military
actions in the 1930s and 1940s. No official apology has been issued
to the United States.
   ``An apology by Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu or Emperor Akihito
would go a long way toward helping both countries put the war
behind them, and get on with properly commemorating the 50th
anniversary of World War II,'' Watson said.

   An influential Democratic senator marking the
anniversary of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor referred Friday
to the Persian Gulf crisis and warned it is unwise to ``tempt
tyrants with messages of weakness.''
   Sen. Daniel Inouye of Hawaii did not mention Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein by name in his speech. But the chairman of the
Senate Democratic Steering Committee predicted ``this tyrant in the
desert'' will be turned back by American resolve.
   Inouye said the United States entered World War II and the
Korean War unprepared because of public demands to dismantle the
military.
   ``Today we once again find ourselves with a tyrant ready to test
the will and resolve of the American people,'' Inouye said.
   ``But, this time, this tyrant knows that our barricades have not
been torn down and that our swords and spears have not been
permitted to rust, and that the people of America, if circumstances
force them to do so, are willing to send their sons and daughters
to stop this tyrant,'' he said.
   ``Many of us who solemnly gather this morning have felt the hot
sting of shrapnel and seen our bodies torn by bullets,'' said
Inouye, who lost his right arm during World War II combat.
   ``Though we sing the many songs of glory, we know that war is
ugly, dirty, painful, and deadly.''
   But to make certain American men and women need not go into
combat, ``we should always listen to the wise words of the ancient
ones who counsel our people not to tempt tyrants with messages of
weakness,'' he said.
   ``We should always remember this moment of infamy.''
   The ceremony aboard the USS Arizona Memorial included wreath
presentations by veterans, patriotic and civic organizations, a
21-gun salute and echo taps.
   One minute of silence was observed throughout the Pearl Harbor
Naval Base at 7:55 a.m., the time the Dec. 7, 1941, attack began.
The moment of silence ended with a ``missing man'' flyover by
Hawaii Air National Guard jets.
   The gleaming, white memorial spans the sunken battleship, which
still contains the remains of 1,102 crewmen who died in the attack.
   Author Ted Mason, a survivor of the Pearl Harbor attack, was
keynote speaker at a concurrent ceremony held at the Arizona
Memorial Visitor Center.
   Ceremonies also were held at several other Oahu military bases
during the day.
   Honolulu city officials used the occasion to dedicate a gift
from the city of Nagasaki, Japan, which provided a replica of a
cathedral bell that survived the atomic bomb blast on Aug. 9, 1945.

   Final payments totaling about $100 million are
going out to states as their share of 1990 national forest sales
receipts, the Agriculture Department said Friday.
   F. Dale Robertson, chief of the Forest Service, said the money
is in addition to a preliminary payment of $246 million which went
to the states on Sept. 19, bringing the total for the fiscal year
that ended on Sept. 30 to more than $346 million.
   By law, 25 percent of the revenues collected by the Forest
Service for the sale of timber and other use of national forest
resources must be returned to the states where the forests are
located. Actual receipts in fiscal 1990 totaled $1.38 billion.
   The states are required to use the funds for schools and roads.
   Oregon is the biggest recipient of total forest receipts for
1990 with $150 million, followed by California, $64 million, and
Washington, $37 million.

<TEXT>
   A series of six earthquakes registering up to 5.5
on the Richter scale shook central Japan on Friday. There were no
immediate reports of damage or casualties.
   The first quake was reported in the Nagano and Takada areas,
about 110 miles northwest of Tokyo, and around Niigata, about 160
miles northwest of the capital, the Meteorological Agency said.
   Five more temblors were reported within two hours in the general
area. The agency said the earthquakes' epicenter was at a depth of
less than three miles in western Niigata Prefecture.
   Police in Nagano and Niigata reported no injuries or damages.
   The Richter scale measures ground motion, with each digit
representing a ten-fold increase in magnitude. A reading of 4 can
cause moderate damage, and a 6 can bring severe damage in populated
areas.
   The quakes were apparently too small to satisfy a prediction by
Iben Browning, a New Mexico physicist and self-professed
climatologist, who predicted a high probability of a severe
earthquake in Tokyo, Missouri or California between Dec. 2-4.
   Few officials reacted to the report in Japan, one of the most
earthquake-active nations in the world.

   Iraq has authorized a group of Western
pacifists to set up a peace camp at the Saudi border between the
anti-Iraqi multinational force and Baghdad's troops, a British
activist said Friday.
   Pat Arrowsmith, the leader of the group calling itself the Gulf
Peace Team, said the first 100 volunteers will establish their camp
Dec. 17. She said hundreds of others will follow.
   She said the group asked to be camped on the Iraqi-Saudi border
to show it does not mean to side with Iraq.
   ``We are a neutral, autonomous group who offered to be between
the two sides to stop war getting started,'' Arrowsmith said. ``We
are telling them that if they want to fight, they will do that on
our own bodies.''
   She said Adnan Dawoud Salman, head of the Iraqi Friendship and
Solidarity Society, had informed her Thursday of the official
decision to allow the camp.
   Adnan, a senior government official and acting head of the
presidency office, was not available to comment.
   The pacifists also intend to ask Saudi Arabia to allow a similar
camp on its side of the border with Iraq.

   Iraq's decision to release all its
hostages is the latest in a flurry of diplomatic steps that could
lead to a peaceful resolution of the Persian Gulf crisis.
   The question now is whether each side is prepared to retreat on
enough other issues to reach a settlement that would let everyone
save some face.
   Any such resolution would force all parties to step back from
original aims, leaving none completely satisfied. But war could be
avoided.
   Since the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, President Saddam Hussein
has proclaimed Iraq's determination to fight, if necessary, to hold
onto the annexed emirate.
   Led by President Bush, a 26-nation allied force has massed in
the gulf in readiness for a possible military strike to liberate
Kuwait.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III's diplomacy won Security
Council approval last week for a military campaign after Jan. 15 if
Saddam does not withdraw his troops from Kuwait.
   With both sides digging in for the Jan. 15 deadline, diplomatic
initiatives suddenly burst forth, beginning the day after the
Security Council's approval of the use-of-force resolution.
   Bush invited Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz to come to
Washington for talks on the crisis, and proposed sending Baker to
Baghdad to meet with Saddam. Iraq accepted the proposal within
days.
   Even more dramatically, Saddam on Thursday proposed the release
of all hostages, and the Iraqi parliament approved the action
Friday. Iraqi officials predicted they would all be home by
Christmas.
   The hostage release fulfills one of the three key demands of the
Security Council. Iraq still must withdraw from Kuwait and restore
the emir's government.
   Saddam, for his part, has said that any withdrawal from Kuwait
must be discussed in conjunction with an overall Middle East peace
settlement that would result in a homeland for the Palestinians.
   Bush and the U.S. State Department have emphasized that there is
no linkage between the gulf crisis and the Palestine issue.
   However, the United States has been allowing the Security
Council to give ``a nod'' in the direction of a Middle East peace
conference this week, as one high-ranking U.S. diplomat put it
privately.
   The United States has a longstanding policy of supporting an
international Middle East peace conference ``at an appropriate
time,'' but has never let the Security Council come out in favor of
such a high-level meeting - which Israel bitterly opposes.
   This week, however, the United States agreed in principle with
the other Security Council members with veto power - the Soviet
Union, Britain, France and China - to let the council endorse such
a conference.
   A comprehensive Middle East peace settlement would necessarily
have to settle the Palestinian homeland question, Saddam's key
demand.
   With all these elements falling into place, an overall
diplomatic solution to the crisis begins to emerge. No one would
get everything they want, but war could be averted.
   A solution could evolve following the Baker-Saddam talks and
Bush's meeting with Aziz. Iraq might decide to begin discussions,
the U.N.'s mid-January deadline could pass, but there would be no
rush to war while talks continue.
   Some of the issues that would have to be dealt with in such
talks are: Saddam's eventual withdrawal from Kuwait; restoration of
the emir's government; and Baghdad's grievances about oil revenues
and access to the gulf.
   Two uninhabited islands off the Shatt-al-Arab waterway to Iraq
might prove to a key bargaining point - if Kuwait were to agree to
lease the islands to give Baghdad security over access to the
Shatt.
   According to some reports, Baghdad might consider withdrawing
from Kuwait if it retains the southern end of the Rumailah oil
filed straddling their border, thus gaining more oil revenues.
Baghdad had accused Kuwait of tapping oil that was rightfully
Iraq's.
   If talks are initiated, the Security Council might take the
first steps toward a Middle East peace conference to be held ``at
an appropriate time'' and ``with the participation of the parties
concerned.'' But Israel would have to agree to the convening of the
conference, and this is far from certain.

<DATELINE>AYODHYA, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Violence between Hindus and Moslems broke
out in southern India Friday and at least 16 people were killed in
stabbings, news reports said. Four others were killed elsewhere in
the nation.
   Authorities clamped an indefinite curfew on the southern town,
Hyderabad, confining people to their homes. Press Trust of India
said the violence started in the morning and continued throughout
the day despite the curfew.
   Fighting between followers of the two faiths also erupted in
northern Aligarh, where at least three people were killed and 12
injured, Press Trust reported. A curfew was also imposed in
Aligarh, it said.
   And in Ayodhya, the flashpoint of a lingering dispute between
the religious groups, a Moslem man was burned to death after Hindu
fundamentalists accused him of trying to disrupt their campaign to
replace a mosque with a temple.
   The identities of victims were not given. Indian news media do
not identify the victims or perpetrators of sectarian violence for
fear it might exacerbate tensions.
   At least 380 people have died in Hindu-Moslem violence in the
last two months since Hindu fundamentalists announced plans to pull
down a disputed mosque in Ayodhya and replace it with a temple.
   At least 22 people were killed when police opened fire on Hindu
militants attempting to storm the mosque on Oct. 30 and again on
Nov. 2.
   On Thursday, the militants resumed their campaign to storm the
temple. But they did not resist when police blocked them from
reaching the disputed shrine, apparently because of an
understanding the event would be more symbolic than real.
   The religious crisis ignited by the Hindu campaign brought down
the government of former Prime Minister V.P. Singh last month.
   Singh's coalition lost its parliamentary majority after a Hindu
fundamentalist party withdrew support over the prime minister's
Ayodhya policy.
   Singh was replaced Nov. 10 by Chandra Shekhar, who has said he
will attempt to defuse the issue by holding talks with Moslem and
Hindu leaders. The talks began in New Delhi earlier this week but
have made no real progress.
   The dispute over the mosque has lingered for more than 100
years. Hindus say Moslem invaders built the small mosque atop a
temple marking the birthplace of Rama, a Hindu god. Moslems say it
is impossible to say where Rama was born.
   Hindus comprise 82 percent of India's 880 million people.
Moslems make up 12 percent.

   Growth in consumer credit slowed to a
seasonally adjusted $1.47 billion in October, the government
reported Friday. Analysts said it was another sign of a weakening
economy.
   ``That is minuscule, a very, very small increase,'' said
economist Sandra Shaber of the Futures Group, a Washington
management consulting firm. ``It mostly reflects that we have a
real softening in the kinds of purchases that people usually use
credit for - cars, furniture, appliances.''
   ``Consumer spending is weak and it's not surprising that
consumer credit is weak,'' she said. ``Consumers are much more
leery about using credit given the business and economic
environment.''
   The Federal Reserve said consumer credit grew at an annual rate
of 2.4 percent, down from a revised 4.6 percent rate posted in
September. The September rate was even slower than the 4.9 percent
advance originally reported.
   ``Growth in revolving credit slowed in October from September,''
the central bank said. ``Auto loans outstanding declined further in
October as did loans for mobile homes.''
   Revolving, or credit card, debt increased $1.56 billion, or an
annual rate of 8.6 percent. That was down from a 12.9 percent gain
in September and a 13.3 percent advance a month earlier.
   Automobile loans declined $785 million, a 3.3 percent annual
rate. Auto loans, which fell 0.1 percent in September, have
declined every month this year except for January and March.
   Ms. Shaber said the auto loan component is more evidence that
relatively strong car sales in October were due more to fleet sales
than purchases by ``ordinary consumers.''
   ``It verifies that it was not ordinary consumers who were buying
cars in October,'' she said.
   Bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate rose $880
million, a 5.0 percent rate which was up slightly from 4.9 percent
the previous month.
   Borrowing for mobile homes fell $188 million, or a 10.0 percent
rate, after declining 15.8 percent in September.
   The various changes left total consumer debt at the end of
October at $736.7 billion.

   Shuttle astronauts reviving the
teacher-in-space dreams of Christa McAuliffe beamed a celestial
lesson to 41 middle school students Friday, allowing the
problem-plagued Columbia mission to create the first ``space

   ``You may have heard of some of the problems we've been

him on television screens at two NASA centers. ``It's been quite an
interesting and dynamic mission.''
   The shuttle's $150 million Astro observatory, crippled by
computer failures, was put back in operation Friday with the help
of commands sent from the ground. But possibly more significant,
the lessons beamed from 218 miles above Earth to American
schoolchildren helped the space agency regenerate some of the goals
struck down in the Challenger disaster.
   ``We weren't trying to take the place of what they were going to
do on Challenger,'' said Karen Widenhofer, a Madison County, Ala.,
teacher on temporary assignment with NASA who assisted in the
classroom Friday at Marshall Space Flight Center at Huntsville.
``But this shows that NASA is still interested in education and
encouraging students in science and math.
   ``NASA still plans to put a teacher in space.''
   Friday's space lesson, conducted by four of the seven astronauts
aboard Columbia, took place nearly five years after the Jan. 28,
1986 explosion of Challenger that killed all seven aboard that
shuttle, including Mrs. McAuliffe, a New Hampshire schoolteacher.
   Denny Elkins, a ninth-grader from Snellville, Ga., was one of
the 12 middle school students from four southeastern states who sat
at a horseshoe-shaped desk in the space classroom at Marshall. He
said he was watching on TV when Challenger's liftoff turned into a
fireball in the sky.
   ``I saw it live because I already was interested in space
travel,'' he said. ``The explosion with the biggest impression of
my life. I really wanted to be an astronaut, but when I saw that, I
said, `No.'''
   ``Now,'' he said, ``I'm reconsidering.''
   During the opening 35-minute lesson, which was about 15 minutes
late because of a communications linkup problem, Hoffman wore a
dress shirt and tie. Usually astronauts wear casual clothes except
for the space suits put on for takeoffs and landings.
   ``When I started thinking about giving a classroom talk in
space, I thought back to my own school days and I realized that all
of the men teachers I had wore ties,'' Hoffman said.
   ``As far as I know, nobody's ever worn a tie in space. I thought
I'd give it a try and see what it looks like in celebration of this
space classroom occasion, and I can tell you it works quite well.
You have to be a little careful in zero-gravity as you can see,''
Hoffman said, pushing down his floating, burgundy patterned tie.
   After Hoffman and astronaut Sam Durrance conducted their lesson,
focusing on star formations and celestial radiation, Ms. Widenhofer
gave students at Marshall about an hour-long class. Another 29
students took part in a similar space classroom at Goddard Space
Fllight Center in Greenbelt, Md. The space schoolhouse concluded
with astronauts Ron Parise and Robert Parker fielding questions
from the students on Earth.
   ``I'd like to know what is the most tedious and painstaking part
of your mission so far?'' said Mario Trimble, ninth-grader from
Montgomery, Ala.
   ``When you fly a mission, most of the time is scheduled very
tightly and there are a lot of things to do,'' responded Parise.
``Unfortunately, some failures with computer terminals have caused
us to redo the way we're doing our mission. We're slowly working
around everything.''
   Bart Doran of Glen, Miss., wanted to know how the problems had
affected the Columbia's missions.
   ``Very greatly,'' astronaut-astronomer Parker said, explaining
that some of the telescope operations had to be done by hand
instead of by computers.
   Troubles persisting throughout the mission have forced the
astronauts to miss more than 100 planned observations. About 250
celestial targets were to have been studied.
   The two computers able to run the observatory's three
ultraviolet telescopes both failed. Flight director Gary Coen said
the cause of the computer failures has not been determined and he
didn't know if it was connected to a lint buildup in the equipment.
   On Friday, the Astro observatory was being run by commands sent
from the ground to guide the telescopes toward their desired
targets. The astronauts used a joystick and, aided by information
from the ground, zeroed in on objects.
   The success of this process Thursday night and Friday gave
scientists hope that many more observations can be made before
Columbia's 10-day flight ends Tuesday.
   ``Our attitude here is that we've got a mode we feel is going to
work and we're going to go get the science,'' mission manager Jack
Jones said. But he added he didn't know yet how efficient the
operation would be.
   Spacelab Mission Operations Control's John David Bartoe
congratulated the astronauts Friday morning for obtaining
``fantastic'' observations of a quasar, one of the most distant
objects in the universe. All three ultraviolet telescopes focused
on the quasar for 51 minutes, three minutes longer than planned.
   ``That's what happens when you have good, old-fashioned
astronomy ... and a little bit of help from your friends,'' Parker
told Bartoe.
   The space classroom programs will be available via some cable
television companies to classrooms.
   To illustrate the importance of studying all types of radiation
emitted from celestial objects, Durrance played two versions of the
theme from the film ``Star Wars.''
   Low and high-frequency notes were filtered electronically from
the first version, and the taped music was unrecognizable. The same
measures then were played with all the notes.
   ``As you can see, you need to hear all the notes to recognize
the song to appreciate its full musical quality,'' Durrance said.
``Studying the universe is the same way. The universe is playing a
kind of symphony in the light that its produces.
   ``Up here in space, our telescopes can see al the radiation to
better understand the universe. That's why some other astronomers
and I are in the shuttle this week using an observatory called Atro
to study the stars.''
   The youngsters will tour Marshall and talk with its scientists
and control team members by the time their visit ends Sunday.
Marshall is the location of Spacelab Mission Operations Control,
which is in charge of Columbia's astronomy work.
   Willie Carter, an eighth-grader from Memphis, Tenn., said the
country ``is sort of regaining from the Challenger explosion. This
has probably put more hope in all of us. I feel better now that
we've got something going compared to the explosion.''

<HEAD>Campaign Ends; Church Endorses Walesa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poland's first popular presidential
campaign officially ended Friday with Lech Walesa enjoying a big
lead and underdog challenger Stanislaw Tyminski being booed at his
own rally.
   Two days before Sunday's vote, the Solidarity chairman was
awarded a strong endorsement from the head of the country's Roman
Catholic Church, to which more than 90 percent of the population
belongs.
   ``The Polish church will side with Walesa,'' Cardinal Jozef
Glemp announced. The unusually explicit statement came after a
meeting in Rome with Polish-born Pope John Paul II.
   ``This is not a political decision but a decision based on
certainty of ... the common good for the whole country,'' Glemp
said.
   Tyminski was trying to recapture the momentum that allowed him
to upset Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki and capture second place
in the first round Nov. 25.
   He conducted a strong first-round race even though he was a
previously unknown businessman who had just spent 21 years in
Canada and Peru.
   However, the last state television election poll, conducted
Monday and Tuesday, showed Walesa with a 73 percent to 16 percent
advantage. Two other polls put the margin at 58 percent to 23
percent and 61 percent to 20 percent.
   On his final stop of the campaign, Tyminski told supporters in
Szczecin he would not leave Poland again, regardless of the
election outcome.
   Szczecin, a northwestern harbor city, traditionally has been a
center of opposition to Walesa.
   But Walesa supporters made up much of the 4,000 people at the
rally. They booed Tymisnki and shouted ``Back to Peru!'' One banner
called Tyminski ``Tarzan from Peru.''
   The rally was Tyminski's last chance to release supposedly
compromising materials of Walesa that he repeatedly claimed to have
in a black briefcase, but he held off, claiming disclosure ``would
be harmful for our country.''
   Walesa had insisted no compromising documents existed.
   Walesa, who rose from shipyard electrician to lead Eastern
Europe's first postwar independent labor union, stayed at
Solidarity headquarters Friday.
   Aides said he planned no public appearances before the vote.
   By law, electioneering was banned from noon Friday. A campaign
news blackout was observed by Polish newspapers and broadcasters.
   Polls open at 6 a.m. Sunday and close at 8 p.m. for the
country's 27 million eligible voters.
   If official results are not challenged, a president could be
sworn in by week's end to replace President Wojciech Jaruzelski.
   In the first round, Walesa obtained 40 percent of the votes,
compared to Tyminski's 23 percent and Mazowiecki's 18 percent.
   Tyminski concentrated his campaign on disaffected farmers and
miners worried about their future under a shock economic program.
He blamed Walesa and Mazowiecki for the hardships of the past 18
months, and promised to improve living conditions within one month.
   In recent days, however, Tyminski himself became an issue.
Reports highlighted his long absence from Poland, links to former
members of the Communist Party, reported visits to Libya,
accusations he used hallucinogenic drugs in Peru and one couple's
allegation that he abused his wife in Canada.
   ``The mobilization against Tyminski ... unfortunately resembles
a witch hunt,'' the newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza commented Friday.
   ``Even when the cause is right, such efforts should not be
organized. That is why we welcome with relief the end of the
presidential race.''

   A log chronicling the B-29 mission that dropped
the atomic bomb on Hiroshima did not sell at auction Friday after
Christie's announced it could not guarantee it was the original
record kept by the navigator.
   Auctioneer Stephen Massey opened bidding at $40,000 after saying
the auction house did not doubt the authenticity of the log.
   ``There may be another authentic document,'' he said.
   No bids were offered and the auctioneer did not go lower. Before
the doubts about the authenticity, the auction house had estimated
the log would sell for $100,000 to $150,000.
   The auction house said it was a coincidence that the document
was offered on Pearl Harbor Day.
   The navigator, Theodore J. Van Kirk, told Christie's auction
house in a telephone call last week that he still has the log he
wrote on the mission, Christie's manuscript specialist Chris Coover
said.
   Christie's officials spent a week investigating the claim, then
decided to back away from the catalog description of the log put on
the auction block Friday, said Coover. The log had been described
as ``the original manuscript navigator's log of the B-29 bomber the
Enola Gay.''
   Christie's considered withdrawing the log from the sale, but
``we have confidence that we're selling an authentic record of the
mission,'' Coover said.
   Auction house officials said in a statement released late
Thursday that they still believed the log was ``an authentic record
... made contemporaneously with the mission.''
   Another sale item generating interest Friday was a letter
written by Ethan Allen, which the University of Vermont hoped to
buy to keep the historical manuscript in the state.
   Christie's put the log on the block for Eileen Lewis, widow of
Capt. Robert A. Lewis, Enola Gay's co-pilot. Mrs. Lewis hoped to
use the sale proceeds for her retirement, said Coover. Its
estimated selling price was $100,000 to $150,000.
   The log put on sale records basic flight information, such as
position, altitude, air speed, and compass direction, on three
yellow, oblong sheets.
   The 9:15 a.m. entry of the document chronicling the 12-hour
roundtrip mission from the U.S. base in the Marianas Islands to
Hiroshima simply says, ``Bomb-Away.''
   The bombing, which marked the world's introduction to nuclear
weapons, left 130,000 casualties.
   On Friday, The New York Times quoted the navigator as saying
during a telephone interview from his home near San Francisco, ``I
am quite confident that the log which I have in my possession is
the one I kept on the airplane.''
   Van Kirk plans to donate his log to an as-yet-unidentified
American institution, Coover said.
   The University of Vermont, meanwhile, sent a bidder to the sale
in hopes of buying the 1787 letter by Ethan Allen, which discussed
a possible trade agreement between then-independent Vermont and
Canada.
   The university raised about $15,000 from individual collectors
and small foundations to buy the letter, which was valued at
$15,000 to $20,000.
   ``It would be a terrible shame if the letter ends up outside
Vermont,'' J. Kevin Graffagnino, curator of the university's
Vermont collection, said recently. ``It belongs in Vermont.''
   Vermont became part of the United States in 1791. Allen led the
Green Mountain Boys in a famous raid on Fort Ticonderoga during the
American Revolution.
   The university has the most extensive collection of Allen papers
in the world and this year paid $13,000 for a 1775 Allen letter.

<TEXT>
   A woman who thought she won $25,000
in a Coca-Cola USA contest said she was heartbroken to see her
expected windfall vanish after being told her entry was invalid.
   Cheryl Hoch, 43, of Traverse City, is one of four people in
Michigan who thought they won $25,000 grand prizes in the Diet Coke
Super Bowl contest.
   They each claim to have collected all five game pieces from
bottle caps and cardboard packages. But officials of the soft drink
company say all of the players' game pieces are not the real thing.
   Hoch met Thursday with representatives from Coca-Cola and D.L.
Blair Corp., the Nebraska company that judged the contest. The
representatives tried to explain to her why she had not won.
   ``I'm not convinced,'' she said after the meeting.
   Coca-Cola spokesman Bob Bertini said the dispute centers around
game pieces marked ``XXII,'' of which only five were printed. He
said the XXII pieces the would-be winners had were not authentic.
   ``There, by and large, is a situation where people don't fully
understand how the game operates or accidentally cut out the game
piece in the wrong way,'' he said.
   Traverse City attorney David Kipley, who also believed he had
won, said the extra XXIIs may actually be XXIII with the last digit
missing - either accidentally left off by the printing machine or
cut off by the contestants.
   Hoch, who is married with two sons, said she did not cheat by
cutting off the last digit of the game piece.
   ``I would never even think of doing anything like that,'' she
said.
   Bertini said there are ``a miniscule number'' of similar
rejected prize claims, but he refused to specify how many. He
rejected Kipley's speculation that some game pieces could have been
misprinted.
   ``It is not a misprint problem,'' Bertini said. ``If it were a
misprint, with 225 million game pieces out there, you would have
widespread problems, and that is just not the case.''
   He said it is coincidence that three of the cases are in
Traverse City.
   Terry Brechbill, vice president of D.L. Blair, which informed
each player that their entries were invalid, did not return phone
calls Thursday and Friday.
   Hoch said contest representatives showed her a photocopy of her
game ticket Thursday and tried to show her the beginning of the
extra digit. She said she did not believe them.
   ``It's heartbreaking,'' she said. ``It's not nice. And it's not
right.''

<TEXT>
   Soviet soldiers on Friday began hauling away what
used to be West Berlin's Cold War food reserves for shipment to the
Soviet Union.
   In all, the German government is sending the Soviets 250,000
tons of food and other supplies by rail, sea and air to help ward
off shortages this winter.
   Organizers are seeking private donations from ordinary Germans
to back the relief efforts. Some Germans have even taken to the
streets with tin cans, seeking contributions for the Soviets from
passersby in Potsdam.
   A telethon on Germany's ZDF television has helped to raise $21
million dollars to date, while companies are rushing to take part
in the relief program.
   Some of the biggest contributions will come from the Berlin
reserves, which were stockpiled with the aim of feeding West
Berliners for several months in case of another blockade like that
off 198-1949, when the Soviets tried to choke off the city.
   The stockpiles of food and other supplies are being given to the
Soviets free of charge.
   Andreas Schuldenzucker of the government press office said
Friday that the Berlin food reserves alone total 214,500 tons. All
of it is being sent to the Soviet Union, she said.
   Shaking off freezing temperatures, Soviet soldiers and German
workers began loading 100 tons of powdered milk onto Red Army
trucks before sunrise Friday.
   The trucks bore the familiar red star and the initials ``CA,''
the Russian alphabet abbreviation for Soviet Army.
   Clearly emblazoned on the sacks of powdered milk were the words
``Made in the Federal Republic of Germany.''
   Escorted by German police and army personnel, the first convoy
of 16 trucks then drove to a Soviet military airfield about 20
miles south of Berlin.
   There, the cargo was loaded onto planes for the flight to the
Soviet Union. Kremlin officials have said they badly need the
powdered milk.
   The Soviets themselves will transport the goods by rail, sea and
air, although the German military will make six flights later this
month.
   The Germans are predicting that their humanitarian mission for
the Soviets will continue at full pace, despite some questions as
to the true extent of shortages in the Soviet Union.
   A civic group has also urged eastern Germans to invite Soviet
soldiers to spend Christmas with them, to promote better relations
between the two sides.
   There are still an estimated 360,000 Soviet troops stationed in
former East Germany. They are to be pulled out by 1994.

<TEXT>
   A state appeals court upheld a
life-without-parole murder sentence for a Vietnam veteran who lost
his legs in the war, saying it had sympathy for his wounds but
could not excuse his killing of a policeman.
   ``Most severely wounded Vietnam veterans have managed to deal
with their anguish without committing murder,'' the court's
presiding judge, Clinton White, said in a ruling Thursday.
   Stanley Verketis, who lost both legs in a land mine in 1968,
returned home suffering from drastic personality changes and became
addicted to heroin and alcohol, according to testimony at his
trial.
   He was convicted of fatally shooting police officer Arthur Koch,
who had responded to a report of gunfire at Verketis' home in
Fairfield northeast of San Francisco in July 1984.
   At his appeal, the defense argued that a life sentence was cruel
and unusual punishment because of Verketis' background.
   The 1st District Court of Appeal agreed that Verketis would not
have been waiting for the officer with a gun had he not suffered a
``life-transforming injury,'' but said that fact did not make the
sentence disproportionate to the crime.
   ``To that extent, we feel sympathy for (Verketis) because he
was, in fact, the victim of events beyond his control,'' White said
in the 3-0 decision.
   White said the same argument could be made for black criminals
from the inner city - that they are victims of poverty and racism.
He said society's responsibility for those conditions would not
make an otherwise valid sentence cruel and unusual punishment.

<TEXT>
   The United States is speeding up millions of
dollars in military aid to El Salvador to help fight off attacks by
guerillas who have acquired sophisticated, Soviet-made missiles and
used them to shoot down two Salvadoran warplanes, the State
Department said Friday.
   Administration officials said a spent canister from a
Soviet-made A-14 surface-to-air missile has been found near the
area where one of the aircraft was destroyed.
   Margaret Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, said the
$48.1 million in aid will allow the Salvadoran government to
replace equipment, including aircraft, damaged or destroyed in the
guerilla attacks that began Nov. 20.
   The attacks have caused some 500 casualties in seven of the
country's 14 provinces, the department said.
   The administration officials, speaking on condition they not be
named, said the guerillas used a Soviet missile to shoot down a
Salvadoran A-37 fighter bomber Nov. 23.
   A guerilla missile brought down an AC-47 fixed-wing gun ship on
Dec. 4, they said.
   The officials said it had been known at the time of a guerilla
offensive last year that the rebels had received A-7 surface-to-air
missiles and possibly American-made Redeye missiles as well.
   The officials said they now have evidence that the guerillas
have obtained and are using computer-guided A-14 missiles, a weapon
with longer range and greater capability than the A-7.
   ``It would appear that the FMLN (guerillas) have recently
introduced into El Salvador a new, very sophisticated generation of
surface-to-air missiles, one official said, referring to the A-14.
   The officials said a canister from a Soviet missile has been
found in ``approximately the same location'' in eastern El Salvador
where the A-37 was shot down.
   An official said the canister was Soviet-made.
   He said A-14 missiles are known to exist in the Western
hemisphere only in the arsenals of Cuba and those still maintained
by Nicaragua's Sandinistas.
   Salvadoran forces discovered 24 SA-7 missiles and one U.S.
Redeye on a Cessna aircraft that crashed in El Salvador last year.
   The official said that flight was organized by Cuba and the
Sandinistas. He said the Redeye could have been captured by the
Sandinistas from the now-disbanded Contra resistance forces inside
Nicaragua.
   He noted that the Salvadoran guerillas recently have claimed
that they now possess A-7, A-14 and Redeye missiles.
   ``We have information arms shipments do continue from Nicaragua
both by land and by sea,'' the official said,
   But he said he is confident they are being organized without the
assistance or knowledge of Nicaragua's democratically elected
president, Violeta Chamorro.
   And he said that hundreds of the A-14 missiles are known to be
in arsenals still controlled by the Sandinistas.
   Of the $48.1 million total in aid, $10.6 million will come from
money left from the $81 million Congress appropriated for the
Salvadoran armed forces in fiscal 1990. The remaining $37.5 million
will be drawn from the $85 million appropriated for fiscal 1991.
   Under conditions imposed by Congress, the final 50 percent of
the 1991 appropriation can be released only if the guerillas
undertake an offensive that threatens the survival of the
Salvadoran government.
   The department spokeswoman said that Secretary of State James A.
Baker III ``has approved accelerated disbursement of fiscal year
1991 military assistance to help the government of El Salvador face
the serious new escalation in FMLN guerilla offensive actions. Some
military assistance funds remaining from fiscal year 1990 also will
be disbursed.''

   Gunmen with automatic rifles
fired on pedestrians, motorists and into homes in a black township
outside Johannesburg, killing three people, police said Friday.
   Six more blacks died in other township unrest overnight,
officials said.
   The conservative Inkatha Freedom Party told black township
residents Friday they could quell the upsurge in black-on-black
violence by cooperating with officials and rejecting mass action
tactics such as rent strikes.
   At the same time, the leader of the militant Pan Africanist
Congress opened a meeting of his group with a harsh appraisal of
the government's reforms.
   Clarence Makwetu told congress delegates meeting in Soweto that
President F.W. de Klerk's racial reforms were of ``no
consequence.''
   ``They are merely intending to reform apartheid. We say
apartheid cannot be reformed but must be totally destroyed,'' said
Makwetu.
   In its home base of KwaZulu, Inkatha supporters urged township
residents to pay their rent and pay for other local services,
saying this would help bring peace.
   Rent boycotts and other mass actions are supported by Inkatha's
main rival, the African National Congress of Nelson Mandela.
Factional fighting between supporters of the two groups has killed
nearly 1,000 people in the Johannesburg townships since August.
   ``There are non-violent, democratic means of achieving results
which no boycott action will ever achieve,'' said a statement from
Inkatha President Mangosuthu Buthelezi.
   The latest violence included an assault by gunmen armed with
automatic rifles in Evaton, south of Johannesburg, that killed
three people Thursday night and injured seven.
   Police Capt. Piet van Deventer said the gunmen, who were
believed to be using AK-47s, shot at motorists and pedestrians. The
slain men were fired on inside their homes, the said.
   Also Friday, five men were found hacked and stabbed to death at
Bekkersdal, southwest of Johannesburg, police said. A ninth death
occurred in Natal province, according to the police report.
   Of South Africa's major black political groups, Inkatha is the
most conservative. Buthelezi supports capitalism, opposes sanctions
against South Africa, and has condemned violence as a way of
fighting apartheid. He has said he is ready to participate in talks
with the government on ending apartheid.
   The militant Pan Africanist Congress opposes sharing power with
the white minority and refuses to negotiate with the government. It
has had little influence in the anti-apartheid movement,
overshadowed by the much larger African National Congress and
Inkatha.
   In other developments:
   -African National Congress leader Mandela released a letter
Thursday saying his group was reviewing its stand on sanctions but
wanted them to remain in effect for the time being. The letter was
to leaders of the European Community, which has indicated member
countries may relax sanctions.
   -A judge refused bail Friday to a right-wing extremist who
claimed responsibility for bombing offices of the governing
National Party. Piet Rudolph faces six charges of terrorism and was
arrested in September after months of evading the authorities.
While in hiding, he sent a videotape to news media declaring war on
the government for its racial reforms.

<HEAD>Cheney Asks NATO Allies to Send Combat Troops to Gulf</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT J. WIELAARD</BYLINE>

   U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
asked the NATO allies on Friday to send combat troops to the
Persian Gulf and make more ships and planes available for
transporting American troops and weaponry.
   He said Iraq's decision to free all foreign hostages will not
alter plans for increasing the U.S. deployment in the gulf to more
than 400,000 troops over the next few weeks.
   ``We don't think (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein deserves any
praise,'' Cheney said after a two-day meeting of the NATO defense
ministers.
   The meeting reaffirmed NATO's pledge to continue work on a
post-Cold War defense strategy based on a reduced U.S. presence in
Europe, smaller and more integrated forces and a continued mix of
conventional and nuclear arms.
   ``Our future force posture will be based on smaller, more mobile
and flexible active forces, able to respond to aggression from any
quarter,'' the ministers said in a communique.
   They said the gulf crisis was an example of the ``continuing
risks of aggression'' from outside NATO territory that affect the
allies' vital security interests.
   The gulf crisis figured prominently in the talks at NATO
headquarters, during which British Defense Secretary Tom King also
appealed for more logistical and combat help from the allies.
   King said Thursday he asked for ammunition, medical equipment
and staff, and chemical warfare gear for Britain's gulf force,
which will soon total 30,000.
   Although Cheney did not mention a need for protective chemical
warfare gear, U.S. officials cited such a need in comments to
reporters.
   Cheney asked the allies for help in transporting America's
``massive flow of men and equipment'' to the gulf, which includes
about 100,000 troops now stationed in Europe.
   He also urged them to send ``heavy combat troops'' and air
defense forces.
   ``If nations wish to commit more forces ... we'll be happy to
have them,'' Cheney said. But he stressed, ``We are not dependent
on that kind of assistance to get the job done.''
   He reported a ``generally favorable response'' but no immediate
commitments.
   The United States and 25 other nations have deployed troops in
the Persian Gulf after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. A United
Nations resolution passed on Nov. 29 gave Iraq until Jan. 15 to get
out of Kuwait or face military action.
   The NATO allies restated their goal of a full retreat from
Kuwait. Allowing Saddam to partially withdraw was reminiscent of
``appeasement of dictators in the past,'' Cheney said.
   To date, all NATO allies have contributed to the Persian Gulf
effort with money, troops or equipment.

<HEAD>Russian Wants Own Convertible Ruble in Two Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The assertive Russian republic plans to make the
ruble convertible on currency exchange markets in two years and
promised new protection for foreign investors, officials said
Friday.
   The statements, however, offered little assurance the vast
republic could carry out its proposals in the turbulent political
climate that has nearly paralyzed power in the country. The
comments were made during a seminar on the Russian economy.
   The Russian parliament also gave preliminary approval Friday to
a resolution on transition to a market economy, but then became
bogged down in debate on amendments, the official news agency Tass
reported.
   Economy Minister Gennady Filshin told participants at the
seminar the ruble would be made convertible slowly in foreign
exchange markets, in order to avoid a sharp drop in value that
would leave the U.S. dollar the dominant currency, Tass reported.
   He offered no other details of the plan at the seminar, attended
by financial experts and would-be investors.
   The dollar already has become the currency of choice for a range
of transactions, from taxi rides to joint venture investments.
Soviet officials have taken measures to try to boost the ruble's
value by outlawing foreign currency transactions to halt
``dollarization.''
   Some of the 15 Soviet republics also have said they want to
create their own convertible currencies as part of their drives for
independence.
   Participants at the conference expressed doubt that even Russia,
the largest republic with 90 percent of the country's energy
resources, could sustain a convertible ruble on its own, Tass
reported.
   Russia's justice minister, Nikolai Fyodorov, also said the
republic's parliament will begin debate soon on a bill to equalize
foreign and Soviet business under Russian law, remove limits on
foreign business activity in Russia, and allow foreign capital to
be brought freely in and out of Russia.
   ``Taxation and customs privileges will be granted to enterprises
with 100 percent foreign holdings and joint ventures that are ready
to re-invest or invest in economically backward regions of
Russia,'' Fyodorov said, according to Tass.
   He said 30,000 ``revenue inspectors'' would be hired to make
sure taxes are paid by the emerging private sector businesses.

Nepotism</HEAD>

   Hortense Gabel, a judge and social reformer
whose reputation was tarnished when her daughter claimed she pulled
strings to get her a job with Bess Myerson's office, died Friday.
She was 77.
   Mrs. Gabel, who died at her Manhattan home, had long been in
poor health and had suffered several minor strokes this year,
friends said.
   A leader in the fight against racial discrimination in housing
after World War II, Mrs. Gabel was a justice for the trial-level
state Supreme Court from 1976 until 1987.
   In 1988 a federal jury acquitted her of charges that she secured
a job for her daughter, Sukhreet, with Ms. Myerson, the city's
cultural affairs commissioner, by ruling favorably for Ms.
Myerson's male companion in a divorce case.
   The charges were based on a report commissioned by then-Mayor
Edward Koch. The report concluded that in 1983 Ms. Myerson, Koch's
friend and political ally, swayed the judge to rule favorably for
Carl Capasso.
   In exchange, the report asserted, Ms. Myerson hired Sukhreet
Gabel for a $19,000-a-year job.
   Capasso had sued his estranged wife for divorce, and Mrs. Gabel
was deciding child support and alimony payments.
   Mrs. Gabel insisted she knew nothing of Ms. Myerson's
relationship with Capasso.
   Sukhreet Gabel was a key witness against her mother, who was
tried along with Ms. Myerson and Capasso. She recorded telephone
calls for the prosecutors and gave them bags full of documents from
her mother's files.
   Hortense Wittstein grew up in the Bronx. A graduate of Hunter
College and Columbia University Law School, she married Dr. Milton
Gabel, a dentist, in 1944.
   In 1986, she was named ``judge of the year'' by the National
Association of Women Judges, an organization she helped found.
   Mrs. Gabel stepped down from the bench in 1987, citing health
problems. She was indicted later that year, and never returned to
work after her trial.
   Milton Gabel died earlier this year. Besides Sukhreet, Mrs.
Gabel is survived by a sister.

   Hundreds of federal and local agents dismantled
an ``absolutely vicious'' gun-running, murdering Jamaican narcotics
ring in overnight raids in New York and Texas, the FBI said Friday.
   Residents of the Brooklyn neighborhood where the group - called
the Gulleymen Posse - was headquartered greeted the raiders as a
liberating army, authorities said.
   James M. Fox, head of the FBI New York office, estimated that
the gang took in more than $100 million in the last five years and
carried out at least 10 murders on orders of its leader, Eric
Vassell.
   The raids were conducted at several sites in Brooklyn, and in
Hempstead, Uniondale and Albany, and in Dallas.
   Vassell escaped arrest and was believed to be in the New York
area. Eighteen of 42 alleged posse members were arrested. If
convicted, all face life in prison on narcotics conspiracies and
racketeering charges that include murder, said Andrew J. Maloney,
the federal prosecutor in Brooklyn. They also are accused of money
laundering and obtaining fraudulent passports and green cards.
   Besides the suspects, the raiders seized more than $150,000 in
cash, six buildings and 15 guns.
   The case was broken with information provided by several gang
members now serving life sentences on guilty pleas to various
crimes, including murder, Maloney said.
   ``Among their own, they were vicious, absolutely vicious,'' Fox
said. ``This guy Vassell would kill his own people for a serious
reason or for a trivial reason. He killed someone because that
person said something nasty to his sister.''
   Maloney described Vassell as a 31-year-old Jamaican who has
fathered 14 to 18 children by various women and has ties to the
ruling People's National Party in Jamaica.
   Vassell ``used part of his money to contribute to the PNP and
it's very likely he'll flee back to Jamaica hoping for some kind of
protection there,'' Maloney said.
   ``Every time Vassell returned to Jamaica, he took a lot of
television sets and he usually had three or four guns stashed
inside of each set,'' Fox said.
   In the complaint filed by Maloney's office, an informant is
quoted as saying that guns shipped to Jamaica inside TV sets in
February were ``vote-getters'' to be used in a runoff on the
island.
   ``Whenever there is a major event in Jamaica ... Vassell sends a
shipment of guns,'' the complaint said.
   Maloney told reporters he was not alleging that Jamaican Prime
Minister Michael Manley knew what was Vassell was doing.
   Federal officials said the Gulleymen Posse got its name from the
McGregors Gully section of Kingston, where its members were from.
   The posse was a heroin wholesaling and distributing operation in
Brooklyn during the last decade and branched into crack in the late
1980s, when it expanded to Dallas, officials said.
   The posse spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in car rentals
to run crack from Brooklyn to Dallas and return with guns every
week, the government said.
   Fox said posse members offered virtually no resistance when they
saw the SWAT teams descend.
   He said one of the arrested men said to an agent: ```You think
we are a posse? You 200 cops, that's a real posse.'''

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Peanut farmers may expect a marketing quota of
1.55 million tons in 1991, a drop of 10,000 tons from this year,
the Agriculture Department said Friday.
   Keith Bjerke, administrator of the department's Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service, said a final quota
determination must be made by Dec. 15.
   The law requires the annual peanut quota to be no less than 1.35
million tons. The quota is supposed to be equal to the quantity of
peanuts needed to meet domestic edible, seed and related needs
during the year. It represents the maximum that farmers may sent to
market under eligibility for the most favorable price supports.

<TEXT>
   The surprise election Friday of a
politically independent judge to succeed Premier Andrei Lukanov
filled Bulgaria's leadership void, but the economic troubles that
helped topple Lukanov persist.
   ``I don't want to offer the nation a cruel program,'' said
Premier Dimitar Popov, head of Sofia's municipal court, ``but I
don't promise anything rose-colored.''
   Popov, 63, who does not belong to any political party, was
nominated earlier Friday by President Zhelyu Zhelev to succeed
Lukanov, who resigned Nov. 29 following protest strikes and
demonstrations. Popov will head a transition government until
elections next summer.
   His election by the 400-seat Grand National Assembly settled the
lingering question over who would run the country.
   Parliament ordered him to present his government to the chamber
within seven days. Meanwhile, foodstuffs and electricity are
rationed. Many other everyday needs are in very short supply.
   The government announced last spring that it was unable to
service the country's $11 billion foreign debt and has been seeking
assistance from the West.
   Since Lukanov's resignation, Bulgaria has been run by Lukanov's
Socialist government of former Communists on a caretaker basis.
   ``My activity resembles a painful operation in order to save a
state and a people,'' said Popov, who helped run Bulgaria's first
free elections in June. ``This is an attempt at a strong government
of professionals and politicians.''
   Popov also told Parliament he was accepting the job provided he
gets broad support from legislators and the public.
   Assembly chairman Nikolai Todorov announced Popov was elected by
a ``large majority,'' but did not give the number of assembly
deputies who voted for him. He said 15 deputies voted against Popov
and 29 abstained.
   His unexpected appointment came after Ginyu Ganev, the deputy
chairman of parliament, refused the post. Sources said that Todor
Valchev, an economics professor, also had turned it down.
   ``We must all realize that the issue of political power is not
the most important one, but that ... of whether Bulgaria can
survive,'' said Alexander Tomov, deputy chairman of the Socialist
Party.
   ``Dimitar Popov is a suitable candidate, both as a personality
and as a neutral figure,'' Lukanov said.
   He lauded Popov as ``a man with character ... who has shown in
complicated situations that he can be non-partisan and objective.''
   Popov, the son of an Orthodox priest, was born in the northern
Bulgarian city of Kula. He studied law and worked for 35 years as a
lawyer for transport companies and later as a judge.
   ``I am neutral as regards my non-membership in a political
force, but I am strongly committed to the ideals of democracy,''
Popov said.
   ``I appeal to all political forces and labor unions to support
this (future) government within the framework of the political
agreement that has to be signed within the next few days,'' Zhelev
told deputies.
   He referred to an accord being negotiated under his auspices to
establish a transitional government, set a timetable for future
legislative work and the drafting of a new constitution.
   But in his speech, Zhelev introduced the new premier without a
word on his qualifications. Rather, he heaped praise on the
outgoing Lukanov.
   ``Andrei Lukanov stepped down, not because he did not have the
necessary qualities of a politician,'' he said. ``He is one of
Bulgaria's most capable politicians and the most outstanding one in
his party.''
   ``His political drama is not of a personal nature, it is the
drama of a political party doomed to separate from state power,''
the president said.
   He also said that ``politicians of Lukanov's caliber and
abilities must not disappear from the political life of the
country. His knowledge, relations and know how are necessary for
the country. Bulgaria does not have so many capable politicians.''
   But analysts said Lukanov was unlikely to join Popov's Cabinet.
   Zhelev had tried hard to set up a coalition government under
Lukanov, but the Union of Democratic Forces, the main opposition
alliance, rejected it. The alliance asserted that Lukanov was
compromised by his Communist past.
   The Union of Democratic Forces was shaken this week by
revelations that its chairman, Petar Beron, was a police informer
under the former regime of Communist dictator Todor Zhivkov.
   Beron's resignation was accepted Thursday. He admitted he
informed on foreign visitors while working at the Natural History
Museum. But Beron said he reported to a department other than the
dreaded domestic secret police.

<TEXT>
   Germany and France, seeking to set the tone
for an European Community summit, on Friday urged that Europe
create common citizenship and defense policies.
   But Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President Francois
Mitterrand said EC leaders ``should respect the obligations already
made'' to the North American Treaty Organization.
   With the Cold War over, there has been growing discussion over
the role of the U.S.-dominated NATO in Europe. Many have proposed
strengthening Europe's own defenses.
   Kohl and Mitterrand made the proposals in a letter to Italian
Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, the host of the EC summit Dec.
14-15 in Rome.
   ``The political union should embrace a genuine common security
policy, which at the end should lead to a common defense,'' they
said.
   The letter was released in Bonn as NATO defense ministers
announced tentative agreement on a new defense strategy. The
defense ministers, meeting in Brussels, called for a reduced U.S.
presence in Europe, smaller forces and maintaining a mix of
conventional and nuclear arms.
   West Germany and the newly united Germany have been NATO's
staunchest supporters, while France is not a part of the alliance's
military command.
   The meeting of the 12 EC leaders will launch an effort to
rewrite the 1957 treaty that set up the community. The new treaty
will strengthen Europe's efforts toward political, economic and
monetary union.
   Kohl and Mitterrand made a strong plea for a variety of issues
that should be made part of the EC process.
   One proposal was to lay the foundation for ``a real European
citizenship.'' The letter also mentioned greater European
cooperation on immigration, drug policy and organized crime
prevention.
   The two leaders said the EC should be ``deepened and expanded''
in the field of environmental, health, social and energy policies.
   Kohl and Mitterrand met Wednesday in Paris to coordinate
strategies ahead of the Rome summit, the second meeting of EC
leaders in two months.
   Italy currently holds the rotating presidency of the EC.
   In October, EC leaders, with the exception of Britain, agreed on
a timetable, conditions and content for a gradual move toward
transferring national sovereignty over currencies to a common
authority.

   A former Salvadoran army intelligence
agent who said he participated in ``death squad'' operations in his
homeland was sentenced to six months in prison Friday for illegally
entering the United States.
   Cesar Vielman Joya-Martinez was sentenced by U.S. District Judge

received a two-year prison term.
   The 27-year-old Joya-Martinez has said he took part in death
squad operations of the Salvadoran army's First Brigade.
   Joya-Martinez, who had been deported from the United States in
1983, was arrested last spring after he appeared at an
administrative hearing to determine if he were eligible for
political asylum.
   Joya-Martinez's attorney, Daniel S. Alcorn, said his client
returned to the United States because he feared Salvadoran soldiers
were plotting to kill him to make him a scapegoat for death-squad
killings.

   Low voter registration indicated a
small turnout Friday for local elections, which drew heavy
participation in the first multiparty races in four years ago.
   The local council elections are the only political choice in the
military-ruled North African nation, which gained independence from
France in 1960.
   The 1986 vote changed the makeup of local councils, but power
still rested with the central government's military committee.
   Soldiers patrolled the streets as polls opened early Friday. But
few people lined up to cast ballots.
   ``I'm not voting,'' said Aly Ahmoud of Nouakchott, who walked
past a polling station. ``It's better to stay home and rest. The
local council for me means high taxes.''
   Only 90,000 people in the capital of 700,000 had registered to
vote. Authorities blame part of the problem on apathy, but
residents complain of bad organization and their disdain for the
bureaucracy.
   The authorized parties competing in Nouakchott include Marxist,
Islamic fundamentalist, black nationalists and the ruling pan-Arab
nationalists.
   The elections will not affect the military government led by
Col. Maawiya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya.
   The vote comes after authorities arrested as many as 300
civilians and military personnel in an alleged coup attempt Nov. 27
organized by black Mauritanians.
   Arabs make up about 70 percent of country's 1.5 million people
and control the government and military. The rest of the population
is predominately black.

   A 30-year-old Corsican was charged Friday in
connection with the 1985 theft of nine impressionist masterpieces
from a Paris museum.
   The works, including Claude Monet's ``Impression Sunrise,''
which gave the movement its name, were stolen Oct. 27, 1985, from
the Marmottan Museum.
   During the daytime theft, five masked gunmen held about 40
visitors and guards at bay while making off with four Monets, two
Renoirs and three other works. The stolen works were recovered by
police this week.
   The suspect, Pierre Comiti, was arrested in Corsica and flown to
Paris, where he was charged Friday with receiving goods stolen in
an armed robbery. Judge Catherine Courcol ordered him held
indefinitely.
   Police questioned Comiti after finding photographs of the stolen
paintings at his home in Corsica, a French-controlled Mediterranean
island. He reportedly led investigators to an unoccupied villa
where the paintings were being kept.
   The combined value of the stolen works was estimated at $20
million.

<TEXT>
   U.S. and Filipino officials ended a
third round of talks on the future of U.S. military bases Friday
without agreeing on the extent to which Philippine laws should
apply to the facilities.
   ``Both sides understand the importance of satisfactorily
addressing this vital component of the prospective bilateral
defense relationship,'' a joint statement said.
   ``Any agreement entered into by both sides will fully reflect
Philippine sovereignty as well as the full measure of equality and
partnership ... the U.S. has with its other allies and partners
around the world,'' the statement added.
   The United States controls Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval
Base, which are among the largest American overseas military
facilities, and four smaller installations under an agreement that
expires in September 1991. A new treaty is required to keep the
facilities after that.
   Philippine panel spokesman Rafael Alunan said discussions on the
status of forces agreement, which defines the extent to which
Philippine laws apply to the bases, will continue in January.
   U.S. chief negotiator Richard Armitage left Manila Friday
shortly after the latest round of talks with Filipino officials led
by Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus.
   Manglapus has said the Philippines will take over Clark and the
four minor facilities after 1991, but will allow continued American
access on a commercial basis. He said the Philippines was open to
extending the U.S. stay at Subic Bay for five to seven years.
   Manila has insisted that Philippine laws be applied to the bases
in economic areas such as tariffs, income taxes, duties, and
licenses, and wants criminal jurisdiction over the U.S. servicemen
there. But this has met with stiff resistance by the Americans.
   U.S. spokesman Stanley Schrager stressed that the United States
does not intend to disregard Philippine laws, particularly those
concerning criminal charges against any U.S. service member. He
said the United States has arrangements with more than 30 other
countries ensuring that U.S. base personnel facing charges do not
escape prosecution.
   Schrager said that although the decades-old alliance between the
United States and the Philippines had served both countries well,
the United States accepts that the new relationship ``is not going
to be the status quo.''
   Alunan said the Philippines, a former U.S. colony, wants to
continue the alliance with the United States but without the
``vestiges of our colonial past.''
   ``We would like to ensure that the United States respects
Philippine laws, and until such time that we are satisfied that
they will be in fact respecting Philippine laws, which we equate to
respecting Philippine sovereignty, ten I don't think we can ever
sign a treaty,'' Alunan said.
   A new treaty on the bases has to be approved by two-thirds of
the 23-member Philippine Senate.
   A recent poll of Senate leaders showed at least 12 opposed a
continued U.S. presence on the bases, enough to vote down a
proposed treaty.
   Critics claim a continuing U.S. presence is an affront to
Philippine sovereignty.

<HEAD>Soviet Lawmakers Demanding Power Meet in Kremlin</HEAD>

   Hard-line lawmakers who want to take emergency
control of the country met with legislative leaders Friday, but a
powerful right-wing politician called the meeting unconstitutional
and boycotted it, news reports said.
   The organizer of the meeting in the Kremlin played down any
serious divisions, indicating he hopes the increasingly assertive
hard-line politicians can be unified in the fractious political
climate enveloping the country.
   In a separate development, a lawmaker reportedly said his
faction would demand that parliamentarians vote on the
``professional aptitude'' of Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
for supporting the possible use of force against Iraq.
   Five groups making up the self-declared National Salvation
Committee met in the Kremlin on Friday with chairmen of both
chambers of the national Supreme Soviet legislature.
   The leaders had been expected to discuss the committee's call
this week for a nationwide state of emergency, suspension of new
political parties and transfer of control to the committee itself,
according to an agenda carried earlier by the independent news
agency Interfax.
   The meeting was closed to reporters, and no other details were
immediately available.
   Vladimir Voronin, a leader of an umbrella organization of 20
groups called the Centrist Bloc of the national parliament, also
had said President Mikhail S. Gorbachev ``is willing'' to meet with
the lawmakers later, Interfax reported. It gave no other details.
   The meeting with the National Salvation Committee in the Kremlin
was held without a leading member of the Centrist Bloc - the
``Soyuz'' group of parliamentarians. The group claims about 500
members in the 2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies.
   Victor Alksnis, leader of Soyuz, called the self-declared
committee unconstitutional and refused to take part in its meeting
Friday, according to Interfax and the state news agency Tass.
   Instead, Alksnis reiterated his call for the central government
to take ``extraordinary measures'' to halt the fragmentation of the
country.
   ``The logic of the recent developments is really bringing home
to us the need (of) creating an extremely strong authority with the
broadest possible powers,'' he said, according to Tass.
   ``However, I believe that this authority should be created in a
constitutional way,'' Alksnis told Tass. ``Otherwise, its creation
will mean the usurping of power by political groups which do not
represent the nation.''
   Voronin, organizer of the meeting, acknowledged the differences
with Alksnis, but said in a telephone interview his attitude toward
Alksnis was ``definitely positive'' and he hoped for cooperation.
   Alksnis said last week that he will call for a vote of no
confidence in Gorbachev if the president fails to show concrete
progress on his plan to hold the country together with a new Union
Treaty.
   The country is riven by autonomy-minded republics, independence
movements, and a crumbling economy.
   Also Friday, a lawmaker identified as Col. Nikolai Petrushenko
was quoted by the independent news agency Postfactum saying that
Soyuz would demand parliamentarians take the vote on Shevardnadze.
   Petrushenko reportedly criticized the Soviet Union for taking a
``pro-American course'' in voting in the United Nations to
authorize the use of force to eject Iraq from Kuwait.
   However, it was not clear if he spoke for the group.

   A judge rejected a plea for mercy Friday from a
man who raped his three daughters over nine years, describing the
father's crimes as ``so perverted, so vile'' before sending him to
prison for 30 years.
   The mother was sentenced Thursday to 15 years for complicity.
   The victims, now aged 17, 20 and 23, conceived 10 times. The
mother took them for abortions each time, the prosecutor said.
   ``I suffered as well. I can't say I suffered as much as my
daughters,'' the father, 43, told the judge. ``For me to do
something like this to someone I love is like sticking knives and
daggers into my own body.
   ``I would hope justice in my case would be tempered by some
mercy,'' he told Baltimore Circuit Court Judge Kenneth Lavon
Johnson.
   The judge replied that ``the defendant asks mercy and leniency -
the same mercy and leniency he could not see fit to give to his own
daughters.''
   He sentenced the Baltimore man to three life terms for rape and
45 years for child abuse. All but 30 years were suspended.
   He pleaded guilty Oct. 29 to three counts of rape and three
counts of child sexual abuse to avoid a trial on 30 counts of rape
and child sexual abuse.
   The names of the parents were withheld to protect the victims'
identities.
   The judge said he was unswayed by letters from the daughters,
who asked that he receive less than 30 years.
   ``The acts of the defendant, the father, are so perverted, so
vile and so inhumane, it requires the response of the law to the
full extent,'' Johnson said.
   The two oldest girls are children of the mother from a previous
marriage. The youngest is a child of both parents. None testified
Friday.
   The man's wife, who described the family as ``very close, very
religious,'' brought the girls to him and he raped them, Assistant
State's Attorney Wanda Keyes Robinson said. The mother feigned
sleep or faced the wall while the daughters screamed and fought
their father, Robinson said.
   The mother, 43, pleaded guilty Oct. 29 to three counts of
first-degree rape and three counts of sexual child abuse. Under
Maryland law, a person who helps someone else commit a felony can
be charged as if the person committed the crime.
   The abuse, which began in 1981, remained a family secret until
March when the youngest victim wrote at the bottom of a history
test: ``I hate life. I hate school. I hate people. I hope to die.
Soon ...!!!''
   Social workers were notified and the father confessed two days
later.
   In a letter to her eldest daughter, the mother said she
justified her complicity by saying that the children had two
parents, were succeeding in school and ``neighbors and school
officials all lauded us as a perfect family.''

   Six senior House Democrats urged President
Bush Friday to provide emergency food, medical and technical help
to the Soviet Union to help in its current crisis.
   ``The United States has a profound duty as the leading democracy
... of the world to demonstrate its commitment to the reform of the
Soviet Union and to the eventual democratic prosperity of the
peoples of the Soviet Union,'' the group wrote in a letter to Bush.
   Deteriorating conditions have led to shortages and long lines
for food and consumer goods in Moscow and throughout the Soviet
Union. On Wednesday, the Soviet ambassador to France, Yuri Dubinin,
began asking for charity, distributing a list of items his
countrymen need.
   The list included powdered milk, meat, vegetable oil, flour and
other food items, as well as medicines and some consumer goods.
   On Friday, Soviet troops began hauling away what used to be West
Berlin's food reserves of 214,500 tons, stockpiled in anticipation
of a repetition of the Soviets' 1948-1949 land blockade of the
city. The German government is giving the food to the Soviets.
   The Bush administration has said that it does not believe the
Soviet Union faces famine, and that the Soviet economy will muddle
through the winter.
   ``We would remind you that the United States remains the richest
agricultural producer in the world,'' said the letter to Bush
signed by Majority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri and these
committee and subcommittee chairmen: Leon Panetta of California,
Budget; Kika de la Garza of Texas, Agriculture; Tony Hall of Ohio,
Hunger; Lee Hamilton of Indiana, Joint Economic and Dan Glickman of
Kansas, the grains subcommittee of Agriculture.

<TEXT>
   State television, showing tear-streaked faces and
ramshackle tents, said Friday on the anniversary of the 1988
Armenian earthquake that thousands of Armenians remain homeless
despite government promises of help.
   ``We didn't fulfill our duty,'' a somber correspondent reported
from Armenia on the national nightly newscast ``Vemya.''
   Panning across whole blocks of idle construction equipment and
tent cities, the correspondent described the failed rebuilding
effort after the quake that killed 25,000. He stopped short of
outright criticism of the government on its own national newscast.
   ``The 2-year-old state program for restoring the area of the
earthquake is frustrated completely. Only a few have received new
apartments. And thousands of others are doomed to spend their third
winter in tents and railway cars,'' said the correspondent,
identified only as an Armenian.
   Hundreds of people, some crying and most appearing sullen, were
shown gathering in a central square in Yerevan, the capital, to
honor the dead as bells tolled between 11 a.m. and noon to mark the
earthquake. The first shock had hit at 11:41 a.m. exactly two years
ago.
   The earthquake, measuring 6.9 on the Richter scale, immediately
leveled hundreds of prefabricated apartment buildings and trapped
tens of thousands of people under tons of rubble. Homes of 500,000
people were destroyed.
   Top government leaders, including President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
and Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov, made widely publicized trips to
the devastated areas and promised a sweeping rebuilding campaign.
But two years later only about 25-33 percent of the damaged homes
and buildings have been rebuilt, Soviet media reported.
   ``Two years to restore the house was only a promise, made from
the bottom of our hearts, but still a promise,'' the correspondent
narrated.
   The newscast showed concretes blocks, apparently intended for
new housing, standing in piles on the sides of pits. Poorly clad
people were shown lifting corrugated steel onto the top of tents to
use as roofs.
   ``To this national grief is added today's troubles: empty
shelves,'' said Eduard Shaknazaryan of the Armenpress News Service,
referring to the worsening Soviet economy.
   ``There is nothing in the shops but bread and mineral water,''
Shaknazaryan said. Despite a system of rationing, food is difficult
and expensive to obtain in the capital of Yerevan, he said, with a
three-hour wait in line for milk, no eggs for sale, and a chicken
at private markets costing about $13, or about one-tenth of a
month's salary.
   Church bells tolled Friday across Armenia, calling survivors
back to their ruined homes to lay flowers and mourning wreaths on
the anniversary of the earthquake.
   In the villages of Leninakan and Spitak, which were hit hardest
by the quake, memorial services were held to remember the hour when
disaster struck. Shaknazaryan said relatives of those killed
returned to the villages to place flowers or wreaths at the sites
where loved ones died.
   Mourners reflected grimly that Friday was brilliant and sunny -
the same weather as when the quake hit.
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda sent four reporters across
the republic to survey the lingering effects of the quake, and they
came back with grim findings.
   ``During our present tour of Armenia, we have come to see for
ourselves once again that it is impossible to write about the
revival of life in the quake-flattened land with cold
rationality,'' they wrote in Friday's editions. ``The tragedy of
Armenia is still felt.''
   In Spitak, where virtually every house was destroyed and 48,000
people were homeless, only 46 percent of the planned reconstruction
has been completed, Pravda quoted Communist Party official Sergei
Grigoryan as saying.
   Only 7-8 percent of the planned housing has been rebuilt in
Leninakan, where 120,000 lost their homes, Pravda said.
   The newspaper Respublik Armenia published an invitation for
Gorbachev and Ryzhkov to return to Armenia on the anniversary to
ee the status of the reconstruction effort, but neither went to
the republic.
   Armenian Construction Minister Gagik Martirosyan said the
rebuilding was hampered by difficulties with supplies of material
and equipment, as well as the increased political and social
tension in the region.
   The TV correspondent said more than 300,000 people were flooding
into Armenia from neighboring Azerbaijan to escape ethnic problems
there.
   Armenia has been embroiled in a bitter ethnic conflict with
adjacent Azerbaijan, which has blocked railways to its neighbor.
   Meanwhile, the government's Children's Fund chose Friday to
bestow its honorary Leo Tolstoy award on Mother Teresa, the
missionary who came to Armenia after the quake to help its victims.

   A Pan Am official on Friday told an
inquiry into the 1988 terrorist bombing of Flight 103 that one of
the flight crew who died on the doomed jet should not have been on
board.
   The inquiry then adjourned for the Christmas holidays until Jan.
22.
   Pan Am's director of flight services, Michael Sullivan, said
Flight 103, with 246 passengers on board, should have had 12 flight
attendants instead of 13.
   All passengers and crew died when the flight exploded over
Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21, 1988.
   Falling debris from the jumbo jet that orginated in Frankfurt,
Germany, killed 11 others on the ground.
   Marina Larracoechea, whose sister was a flight attendant on the
Pan Am jet, asked about the discrepancy. Sullivan said he could not
explain it and that the only one who could, the pursar, died on the
flight.
   ``No one saw the extra person arrive,'' said Sullivan.
   The inquiry, in its 10th week, has heard evidence from 150
witnesses.

   A former state lawmaker pleaded guilty
Friday to charges of conspiring to accept a bribe and tampering
with a witness in a Statehouse corruption scandal.
   The plea by former Rep. Tom Limehouse averted a trial set for
Monday.
   In return for his plea, the government dropped a third charge
that he took a $2,000 bribe to support legislation legalizing
betting on horse and dog racing in South Carolina.
   Limehouse, who appeared before U.S. District Judge Falcon
Hawkins, faces a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison and a
$500,000 fine. The dropped charge had a maximum penalty of 20 years
in prison and a $250,000 fine.
   The Summerville Republican withdrew from the Nov. 6 election but
did not resign his seat like several other lawmakers under
indictment.
   The federal probe at the Legislature has led to bribery charges
against nine lawmakers and drug charges against a tenth lawmaker
and a Statehouse lobbyist.
   Earlier this week, former state Sen. Rick Lee and former state
Rep. Luther Taylor became the first of that group to be sentenced.
   Lee, R-Boiling Springs, got six months at a halfway house and
five years' probation. Taylor, D-Columbia, was given 6{ years in
prison.
   Lee had pleaded guilty to accepting a $2,000 bribe from lobbyist
Ron Cobb for his work on behalf of the pari-mutuel betting bill.
   Taylor, the first to go on trial, was convicted by a jury in
October on six counts of violating the Hobss Act, a federal
anti-bribery law.
   He was charged with conspiring to solicit bribes and with
accepting a total of $4,300 from a lobbyist-turned-FBI informant
for supporting the betting bill.
   Also this week, former state Rep. Donna Moss got three years
probation and a $2,500 fine on a cocaine possession charge. She was
not connected with the bribery scandal, prosecutors said.
   Three other former House members have pleaded guilty to bribery
charges and await sentencing.
   Meanwhile, three House members charged with selling their votes
for cash await trial next month; they all won re-election to the
House in November.
   The lobbyist charged with marijuana possession died of a lung
disease in late November.
   A federal grand jury indicted Limehouse on Sept. 21 on the three
charges stemming from ``Operation Lost Trust,'' an FBI probe of
Statehouse corruption.

   The Western hostages in Iraq may have to wait a
bit longer for the beginning of the final airlift and for the
bubbly to celebrate it.
   A British Airways jet stocked with chilled champagne took off
Friday bound for Baghdad, the Iraqi capital, to begin the exodus of
remaining hostages promised by President Saddam Hussein.
   But the plane got stuck en route in Jordan after confusion arose
over its clearance rights to land in Iraq.
   The British Airways flight was being closely watched by other
nations hoping to send planes to evacuate their trapped citizens.
   Iraq's civil aviation authorities gave clearance, a British
Airways spokesman said, but the airline kept the flight in Amman
because a news report from Iraq quoted an unidentified official as
saying permission had been denied.
   A British Airways spokesman said Iraqi civil aviation
authorities had given permission for the plane to land in Baghdad.
   ``In light of what is being reported, we'll put the plane in
Amman until the situation is clarified,'' the British Airways
spokesman said on condition of anonymity. ``We've received no
official notification of a denial.''
   ``We're in touch with the Foreign Office and asking them to
press for a reconfirmation of the landing permit,'' he said.
   Iraq's Parliament on Friday confirmed Saddam Hussein's decision
to release about 8,000 Westerners, East European and Japanese
hostages who have been held since the Persian Gulf crisis began
with the Kuwaiti invasion of Aug. 2.
   Iraq said Westerners would be free to leave starting Saturday
and could apply for exit permits immediately.
   Japan, Denmark and Italy prepared flights to carry citizens
home. The Dutch reportedly were readying an Airbus jet to fly to
Baghdad on Tuesday to pick up some of the 133 Dutch nationals
remaining in Iraq and occupied Kuwait.
   Switzerland and Norway also were arranging flights to bring home
seven Swiss and five Norwegians from Iraq.
   In New York, Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon said the U.S.
State Department had inquired about available planes.
   ``We're still looking into that. December is a busy travel
season, but we would of course do whatever possible,'' she said.
   The U.S. State Department said contingency plans had been made
to charter aircraft, but that nothing was scheduled until specifics
about the release were known. Officials said they asked Iraq to
waive exit visa requirements for the 900 U.S. citizens and other
hostages held.
   The British Foreign Office also was pressing Iraqi authorities
to expedite departures, and also were having problem getting
details.
   The Foreign Office on Friday warned Britons hiding in Kuwait to
stay put until departure logistics were clear. A similar message
was broadcast in the region over Voice of America on Thursday.
   The Iraqis said Friday that the release offer was genuine. A
spokesman at the Iraqi embassy in London said all hostages had
``the right to leave immediately'' regardless of whether they were
in hiding or being detained.
   The spokesman said on condition of anonymity that Iraq had
decided to release the hostages because ``The holy festival of
Christmastime is coming and we feel that people should be with
their families.''
   Hoping to ferry some of this Christmas spirit, the British
Airways flight carried 400 Christmas cakes, 400 bottles of
champagne and 200 clean sweatsuits.
   ``I should think that the atmosphere on board on the way home
will be euphoric, to say the least,'' said Gil Gray, pilot of the
flight.
   British Airways said the airlift of Britons would be boosted by
other aircraft, if needed. Virgin Atlantic also planned to send an
aircraft to aid the evacuation.
   Janet Edwards, whose husband Stephen is in hiding in Kuwait,
said he will wait until it is absolutely safe to emerge.
   ``People have an awful lot at risk and they won't give
themselves up until it's been confirmed that it's safe to do so,''
Mrs. Edwards said.
   The Britons in hiding will listen to the BBC World Service or
hear by word-of-mouth that it is safe to go, she said.
   It is expected to take days, at least, for Iraq to process the
hundreds of Westerners held in Iraq and an estimated 2,000 others
believed hiding in Kuwait.

   Media magnate Ted Turner confirmed Thursday that
he and actress Jane Fonda will be married, about a year from now.
   ``We're engaged. We are going to wait a year,'' Turner said
during a private reception before a Variety Club of Atlanta dinner
in his honor.
   Ms. Fonda shyly displayed the engagement ring given her by
Turner, chairman of Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting System Inc.,
the parent company of Cable News Network.
   ``I've been married twice, but I never had one before,'' she
said of the ring, an opal set between two diamonds.
   Turner bought the ring at Tiffany's last month in Los Angeles.
At the time, a publicist for Ms. Fonda said he planned to give it
to her on her birthday, Dec. 21.
   The marriage would be the third for both Ms. Fonda, 52, and
Turner, 51. She has two children, he has five.
   Turner and Ms. Fonda were among 420 guests at the dinner, where
Turner received the club's humanitarian award.

   Chad's former president, ousted by
rebels last weekend, hopes to find refuge in the United States, his
entourage reported Friday.
   But Hissene Habre would like to remain in Yaounde as long as
possible while searching for a country to grant him permanent
asylum, the sources said.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman in Yaounde reported Friday that Habre
had not been in contact with its diplomats to request asylum and
referred further queries to the State Department in Washington.
   Habre, 48, has reportedly been negotiating asylum in Zaire. But
members of his entourage report that he would ultimately like to
take up residence in the United States.
   Habre fled by aircraft on Saturday to Maoura, about 400 miles
northwest of the capital, just ahead of a rebel advance into the
Chadian capital of N'Djamena. He arrived in Cameroon's capital on
Wednesday.
   The rebels were led by Idriss Deby, Habre's one-time chief
mllitary adviser, who will head an interim government until
promised democratic elections can be organized.
   Habre and Deby fell out in April 1989 over allegations that Deby
was plotting a coup. Deby fled to Libya and then to eastern Sudan.
   There, he organized the rebellion that toppled Habre in a
three-week offensive that began with border raids on Nov. 10 and
ended Sunday when Deby entered N'Djamena as conqueror.

   Saddam Hussein has deployed some of the
seven new army divisions he said he was forming to reinforce his
troops in and near Kuwait, Arab sources said Friday.
   Also Friday, Iraq's Defense Ministry ordered all reservist
farmers to report to their military units starting Dec. 17. It said
those who don't will be listed as deserters and risk execution.
   The announcement on state radio came as U.S. military officials
reported a steady buildup of Iraqi troops in occupied Kuwait.
   The developments indicated Saddam has no plans to relinquish
Kuwait, despite upcoming talks with U.S. leaders and his
announcement that all hostages will be free to leave.
   The Arab sources, speaking on condition of anoynmity, said it
was not known whether the seven new divisions, drawn mainly from
the reserves, were in Kuwait or have joined the Iraqi strategic
reserve force in southern Iraq. That force includes Saddam's best
troops, 120,000 of the elite Republican Guards.
   An Iraqi division usually has around 12,000 members.
   Pentagon spokesman Bob Hall said Thursday that 30,000 additional
Iraqi troops detected in or near Kuwait in the last week had been
moved there from the Iranian border.
   He estimated Iraqi forces in the area at 480,000, with 2,700
artillery guns and 4,000 of Saddam's 5,500 tanks.
   Saddam has been reducing his divisions on the 730-mile Iranian
frontier since mid-August, when he agreed to Tehran's demands for a
peace treaty to formally end the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.
   The Iraqi leader announced last month that he was forming the
new army divisions and mobilizing another 150,000 reservists to
strengthen his force in the emirate Iraq conquered Aug. 2.
   Saddam said they included 60,000 farmers who had been
demobilized to boost food production because of the U.N. embargo
imposed on Iraq. With the harvest season over, he said those men
were now eligible for mobilization.
   The Defense Ministry announcement said the farmer reservists
have three days from Dec. 17 to report in or be listed as
deserters. In Iraq, deserters are executed.
   Thousands of the reported 100,000 men who deserted during the
1980-88 Iran-Iraq war were shot by firing squad, often in front of
their families and neighbors.
   Saddam's move to beef up his forces was in apparent response to
a new deployment by U.S. forces in the gulf.
   More than 250,000 American soldiers are now in the gulf as part
of a multinational force arrayed against Iraq. By mid-January,
200,000 more troops will be in the region to boost U.S. strength to
around 450,000.
   The U.N. Security Council has passed a resolution authorizing
the use of force to drive the Iraqis out of Kuwait if they do not
leave by Jan. 15.
   The Iraqis have built a formidable, three-layer defensive system
along Kuwait's coastline and along the Saudi border.
   They have been reported to be extending that defensive line
westward from the Kuwaiti border.
   The U.S. commander in Saudi Arabia, Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf,
said early this month that the Iraqis have apparently positioned
their least capable troops in the first of the three defensive
layers.
   ``You've got the worst troops forward,'' he said. ``(This force)
doesn't have very much will to do much of anything. The second
level of troops ... are better. I think you've got the best troops
all the way to the rear.
   ``I think that they're arrayed that way for the reason they
they'd like us to take them head-on, dissipate our force as we go
through each belt and when we're considerably weakened, the
strongest force would hit us.''
   An 11,000-member U.S. Marine amphibious force in the gulf has
been conducting landing exercises in preparation for a possible
seaborne attack on Kuwait from the east.
   That would presumably be launched simultaneously with sustained
air strikes and a ground offensive from the south.

   Animal rights activists caused a stir at the
opening of the La Scala opera season Friday night when they hurled
tomato juice at women wearing furs.
   The trio - two women and a man - hurled juice at plainclothes
police who surrounded them, turning their shirts and jackets red.
At least two women's furs were splattered red by the juice.
   ``This is not the temple of `bel canto' (beautiful song) but an
exhibition of furs which drip blood!'' the man shouted as he was
dragged out of the theater.
   The demonstrators slipped through tight security into the main
entrance to attack the women in furs.
   Police said the three demonstrators were released without
charge.
   La Scala's gala night, inaugurating the opera season of Italy's
most renowned theater, has a long tradition of protests.
   However the most feared demonstrators, striking metalworkers,
did not show up. Dozens of riot police quietly patroled the theater
area, near the cathedral square in downtown Milan.
   Despite freezing temperatures, about 200 onlookers standing
behind iron barriers commented on and applauded the entrance of
smart theater-goers.
   On the artistic side, the gala night was enlightened by a rare
performance of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Idomeneo.
   The opera's main characters were played by Swedish tenor Gosta
Winbergh and by three American singers - Delores Ziegler, Carol
Vaness and Patricia Schumann.
   Riccardo Muti conducted the opera.

<HEAD>Report: U.S. Trained Libyan POWs in Chad as Anti-Gadhafi Commandos</HEAD>
<DATELINE>N'DJAMENA, Chad (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Embassy said Friday it is
helping Libyan prisoners of war in Chad who don't want to return
home, but declined comment on a report that hundreds were trained
to operate as anti-Libyan commandos.
   Agence France-Press, the French news agency, reported that 200
Libyan POWs were evacuated from N'Djamena on Friday aboard a U.S.
Air Force plane.
   It said the Libyans left because of the ouster of pro-Western
President Hissene Habre by a rebel movement that received much of
its weaponry from Libya.
   According to AFP, about 700 Libyan soldiers of the 2,000
captured during 1983-87 fighting had received commando training
from U.S. military advisers.
   AFP said the first batch of evacuees was loaded aboard a C-141
Starlifter plane and reportedly flown to Lagos, Nigeria.
   Barbara Shell, a spokeswoman at the U.S. Embassy in Chad, said
the United States was assisting a number of Libyan POWs who did not
wish to return to Libya. She said she could not comment further.
   According to AFP, the Libyans who received commando training
initially agreed to assist the Chadian army. Later, they reportedly
were placed under the command of a Libyan colonel and given
commando training at a camp near N'Djamena, Chad's capital.
   AFP quoted unidentified sources as saying the commandos had laid
mines and staged some attacks in southern Libya in recent months.
   After Habre's ouster a week ago by the forces of rebel leader
Idriss Deby, a delegation of Libyan officials flew into N'Djamena.
They arranged for the bulk of the Libyan POWs to return to Libya
and reportedly sought to obtain custody of those who turned against
the government of Col. Moammar Gadhafi.
   Libyan television reported Friday that the POWs who came home
were greeted with festivities at the Tripoli airport.
   Rebel leader Deby has been installed as interim president, and
Habre has taken refuge in Cameroon.

   A jury Friday found Soldier of Fortune
magazine liable for $12.4 million in damages for running a ``gun
for hire'' ad blamed for the 1985 killing of a businessman.
   Robert Brown, the magazine's founder and publisher, said he
would appeal the award to the slain man's two sons. ``I'm not
surprised by the verdict,'' he said. ``I think we'll see it
overturned on appeal.''
   Steve Glassroth, a lawyer for the sons of Richard Braun, said
the judgment by the U.S. District Court jury sent a warning that
``publishers have to exercise a measure of responsibility when
dealing with an ad of this nature.''
   Attorneys for the magazine had argued in the First Amendment
case that the publication should not be held liable and that
publishers have no duty to research the background of their
advertisers.
   The lawsuit was the second such case against the magazine to go
to trial. In the previous trial seeking damages in a woman's
slaying in 1985, a jury in Houston returned a $9.4 million verdict.
That award was reversed on appeal last year and the U.S. Supreme
Court let the decision stand.
   In the Alabama lawsuit, the jury heard 4{ days of testimony
before deliberating for just two hours Friday.
   Brothers Michael, 21, and Ian Braun, 26, both of Montgomery,
blamed their father's death on a ``gun for hire'' classified ad in
the magazine's June 1985 issue by Richard Savage of Knoxville,
Tenn. The Brauns contended their father's business associate, Bruce
Gastwirth, used the ad to arrange to have Braun killed.
   Michael, then 16, was wounded in the Aug. 27, 1985, attack in
the family's driveway in Atlanta.
   The jury awarded $10.4 million to Michael Braun and $2 million
to the brothers jointly.
   Ian Braun said the verdict would never undo the emotional damage
to his brother, who he said is afraid to express emotion to family
members since seeing his father killed.
   Brown ``was certainly within his right to publish his magazine,
but what goes in you've got to be responsible for,'' Ian Braun
said.
   Michael Braun declined to comment.
   Savage's classified ad read: ``GUN FOR HIRE: 37-year-old
professional mercenary desires jobs. Vietnam veteran. Discrete and
very private. Body guard, courier and other special skills. All
jobs considered.''
   In 1986, the magazine stopped running such ads.
   Gastwirth, Savage and two associates were convicted of Braun's
killing. Savage already had been convicted in a similar
murder-for-hire case in West Palm Beach, Fla., as well as several
attempted assassinations that went awry. They are now serving
prison sentences.
   In closing arguments, defense attorney Jim Garrett told the
jury, ``A publisher has no duty to investigate'' every advertiser,
but if the magazine had checked Savage, it would have found he
served in Vietnam and was a courier under Gen. William
Westmoreland.
   Trial testimony showed Savage had no felony police record when
he placed the ad, and Garrett said the ad ``did not contain a
clearly identifiable risk that it is an offer to commit murder.''
   A Braun family attorney, Steve Glassroth, said Soldier of
Fortune should have been aware of news stories about a series of
unrelated crimes in the early 1980s tied to its classified ads.
Those stories should have stopped the magazine from running the
personal services ads long before 1986.
   Brown denied seeing any of those stories. He said he ran the ads
to help Vietnam veterans find jobs using their military skills.

   The U.S. military is issuing
injectable Valium to Persian Gulf soldiers to protect them against
chemical weapons, a Navy doctor said Friday.
   Valium, the brand name for the drug diazepam, helps ease
convulsions from severe nerve gas exposure, said Cmdr. Thad
Zajdowicz, the doctor in charge of readiness and training for
chemical weapons decontamination at Navy Fleet Hospital Five.
   The doctor said the military decided to use Valium as an
anti-chemical weapon agent before the troops were deployed to Saudi
Arabia in August, but the drug is only now beginning to get to the
soliders. Zajdowicz said Fleet Hospital Five received its first
Valium shipment last week.
   The drug presently issued to all service personnel along with
their protective suit can reverse peripheral symptoms of nerve gas
exposure - sweating, lung congestion and increases in body fluids,
said Zajdowicz.
   Valium is commonly used as a tranquilizer and muscle relaxant.
   Zajdowicz, 42, said Valium was added on the advice of Col.
Michael Dunn, of the Army Medical Research and Development Command.
   The 10-20 milligrams of Valium being issued to soldiers is a
slightly higher dosage than given to patients in order to calm
anxiety, said Zajdowicz of Norfolk, Va.
   ``The intent of the distribution will be that it will be carried
as personal protection by the individual soldier, sailor or
airman,'' he said.

<HEAD>Brilliant Pre-dawn Flash of Light Was Fireball</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TED HAMPSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dazzling blue-green flash that lit up the
pre-dawn sky across much of the Midwest on Friday was a fireball
burning up as it entered the Earth's atmosphere, an astronomer
said.
   ``That blue-green flash was a fireball and anyone who saw it,
well, that was great, because as long as I've been here I've never
seen one. They're fairly rare,'' said April Whitt, an astronomer at
the Adler Planetarium.
   A fireball is similar to a meteor, Whitt said, except that
fireballs are made up of larger particles, pebble-sized rather than
dust-sized.
   Dozens of people in Illinois, southern Michigan, Kentucky and
Ohio called police departments, radio stations and the planetarium
after witnessing the flash at 5 a.m.
   William Spencer of Southfield, a Detroit suburb, said he saw the
light on his way to work.
   ``It was a big bluish-green ball of light and it had a train of
yellow sparks behind it,'' he said. ``I thought it was a
helicopter, it was moving fast ...Then it just disappeared. I
thought it had crashed.''
   In Ohio, the flash was reported by callers from Cincinnati to
Toledo. Reports also were received in Louisville, Ky. Whitt said
the planetarium received calls from motorists who saw the flash
while driving on Chicago-area expressways.
   Whitt said astronomers expect a meteor shower starting Dec. 13
as Earth travels through ``a trail of junk left by a comet.''
   ``That trail of junk just happens to take the orbit that the
earth takes as we travel around the sun,'' she said. ``So we get to
sweep through this dust pile every December.''
   Officials at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt,
Md., and the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington said they had no
information about satellites or other manmade space objects
crashing to Earth.
   Maj. Thomas Niemann, a spokesman at the U.S. Space Command in
Colorado Springs, Colo., said the agency also believes the object
was of ``other-than-Earth origin.''
   He said the center tracks about 6,700 satellites, none of which
was responsible for the flash.

<TEXT>
   The White House warned Iraq Friday
``there's no lessening in the threat of war'' even with release of
American hostages.
   But, ``Things are moving in the right direction,'' said
presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater as President Bush arrived
on the last stop of his South American tour. Bush came to Caracas
to thank Venezuela for easing this fall's global oil crunch with
increased production of crude.
   Fitzwater said the U.N. vote authorizing military action against
Iraq ``forced this series of events. It forced Saddam (Hussein) to
make concrete changes.''
   Iraq still must comply with United Nations demands for its
withdrawal from Kuwait and fulfill all other conditions set forth
by the world organization, Fitzwater said.
   Bush received a 21-gun salute as he arrived in Caracas for talks
with President Carlos Andres Perez.
   As it has on each stop of his week-long trip, the Persian Gulf
crisis overshadowed events the day.
   Iraq's parliament overwhelmingly endorsed Saddam Hussein's order
to release more than 8,000 foreign hostages. Among them are 900
Americans.
   ``We hope that some Americans will be able to come out
tomorrow,'' Fitzwater said.
   Yet, Fitzwater said the crisis had not eased.
   ``There's no lessening in the threat of war,'' he said. ``That
threat exists just as strong as ever.''
   On the hostages, Fitzwater said said the United States proposed
to Baghdad flying all Americans out on planes chartered from Iraqi
Airlines or from other companies, the same way more than 2,000
other Americans have departed Iraq and Kuwait.
   As a backup, the government has been checking on the
availability of U.S. airlines and charter planes, he said.
   Fitzwater said he believed that all Americans in Kuwait had been
accounted for, and that the United States expects there will be no
reprisals by Iraq against anyone who hid Americans in Kuwait.
   He expressed skepticism over Iraq's motives in freeing the
hostages.
   ``They have concluded that the hostages no longer work for them
and that the issue works against them,'' he said.
   He said Baghdad, in promising to release the hostages, was
trying to divide the global coalition against Iraq and ``weaken the
international will in the gulf.''
   Caracas was the last stop on a week-long tour to salute the
emergence of democracy and economic reforms throughout the region.
   As in Chile, where guerrillas set off half-a-dozen bombs and
police tear-gassed anti-Bush student demonstrators, Bush's visit
ignited traditional anti-American sentiments.
   Army and National Guard units took over the Andean city of
Merida to prevent further violence from student protestors and
eight people were injured in clashes between students and police in
Caracas late Thursday. Several police officers were reported
injred, one seriously. Students also marched against the Bush
visit in Maracaibo, Venezuela's second largest city and its oil
center, and in Valencia.
   Toasting Perez at a state dinner, Bush saluted the tide of
democracy and economic reforms that have swept South America,
``leaving Cuba as the lonely totalitarian holdout in our
hemisphere.
   ``So we are close, very close, to a democratic hemisphere, from
Alaska to Argentina,'' Bush said. ``This era of peaceful change
came about in no small part because of the unwavering leadership
and example of a democratic Venezuela.''
   In his toast, Perez said, ``Our solidarity is firm'' against
Iraq.
   He said Venezuela supports the U.N. decisions and steps taken by
the United States ``to safeguard mankind from a catastrophic war''
caused by Iraq's attempt to erase from the map ``a universally
recognized state.''
   As he arrived in Caracas from an overnight stop in Chile, Bush
expressed disappointment over the collapse of global trade
negotiations in Brussels.
   Bush blamed the collapse on the failure of the European
Community, Japan and Korea to reduce farm subsidies, and said he
hoped they would reconsider and negotiate ``real market-opening
agreements while there is still time to do so.''
   After Iraq invaded Kuwait, Perez joined with Saudi Arabia to
lobby OPEC members to sustain production levels and stabilize
prices, and increased his own country's output 20 percent to 2.4
million barrels a day.
   ``That's made a major contribution not just to our economy but
particularly to energy-dependent economies in the developing
world,'' a senior administration official said of the efforts of
Venezuela and Saudi Arabia.
   The price of oil has fluctuated wildly since August, rising when
Persian Gulf tensions increased and receding when peace prospects
seemed to improve. Perez has called for talks among consumers and
producers to see if a way can be found to stabilize prices.
   Officials said Venezuela advocates creation of a hemispheric oil
reserve for emergencies, but that the United States has so far
shown little interest in the idea.
   During his presidency, Bush has developed a warm relationship
with Perez. The trip to Caracas marks the seventh time they have
met. The two leaders were holding talks before a state dinner and
they were to meet again Saturday before Bush returns to Washington.
   In a speech to businessmen in Santiago, Bush pledged that the
events in Eastern Europe and elsewhere will not hamper U.S.
relations with Latin America.
   ``We are not going to neglect Central or South America,'' Bush
said. ``This is our hemisphere.''
   Bush told a gathering of the Chilean-American Chamber of
Commerce that with the restoration of democratic rule in Chile
after 17 years of military government, ``our two nations are united
as never before.''
   He also said that economic reforms in Chile have led to a surge
in foreign investment here and ``even better times lie ahead.'' The
Chilean example, he added, demonstrates that ``market forces are
the way to prosperity.''

<HEAD>Judge Extends Paper's Right To Employ Hawkers in Subway</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERA HALLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Friday said the
strike-plagued Daily News could be sold by hawkers at subway and
train stations for at least another 10 days.
   U.S. District Judge Miriam G. Cedarbaum of Manhattan continued
her week-old order until Dec. 17. New York Newsday and the New York
Post both applied to gain the same access and were awaiting an
answer.
   Cedarbaum said the Daily News had shown irreparable harm, adding
that its lawyers ``made a substantial showing'' that its First
Amendment rights ``would be violated if I did not continue the
temporary restraining order.''
   The hearing was part of a lawsuit the Daily News filed last week
after the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the
city's subway system and suburban commuter rail lines, barred
hawkers.
   ``We are pleased with this ruling ... We are selling papers at
over 100 locations in the transit system, and the judge has today
affirmed our right to continue to do so,'' Daily News Vice
President John Sloan said.
   The ruling drew an irate response from the transit authority's
unions, which announced a Monday meeting with News strike leader
George McDonald to determine a collective response.
   ``We are angry and disgusted at the court's decision on the use
of hawkers,'' said Sonny Hall, president of Transport Workers Union
Local 100. ``We'll have a definitive plan of action to announce on
Monday.''
   The lawsuit claims the Daily News depends on hawkers to
distribute the paper in the transit system because virtually all
newsstands there stopped carrying the paper after the Oct. 25
strike. Cedarbaum agreed the hawkers were legal.
   New York Newsday renewed its request Friday to place hawkers in
the same stations where the News is allowed, said spokeswoman
Chiara Coletti. The Post did the same, although spokesman Gary Lewi
said the tabloid will not use hawkers where it already has
newsstands handling the paper.
   MTA spokesman Tito Davila said the agency had not ruled on the
Newsday permits.
   The Daily News has published every day during the six-week
strike but distribution has been a major problem cutting
circulation in half from the pre-strike 1.09 million copies daily.
Newsday and the Post have made major circulation gains during the
strike.
   A transit authority lawyer, Susan Weiner, argued the Daily News
had alternative means to distribute the paper, citing vending
machines. She said the MTA revoked permits originally given to
hawkers because of passenger safety concerns and the fear of
service disruptions.
   But News attorney Herbert M. Wachtell dismissed Weiner's
arguments as ``frivolous.''
   He claimed the MTA rescinded the hawkers' permits because of
pressure from transit unions who threatened a work stoppage if
hawkers were allowed to sell the paper.
   In extending the temporary restraining order, Cedarbaum noted
that the transit authority had not provided specific examples of
violence or disruptions of service.

<HEAD>US to Pull Diplomats From Besieged Embassy If Americans Freed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States announced Friday it will
pull all diplomats out of its besieged embassy in Kuwait once
American hostages leave the occupied sheikdom. The top-ranking U.S.
envoy in Baghdad asked Iraq to waive exit formalities to speed
hostage departures.
   The embassy in Kuwait City, cut off from food and water for
months, has been kept staffed in defiance of Iraqi orders that all
embassies there shut down. And it will be considered officially
open even after the eight diplomats leave, said State Department
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.
   ``We will expect Iraq to safeguard the premises until the
legitimate government of Kuwait and our embassy staff return,'' she
said.
   U.S. officials denied the decision was a concession to Iraqi
demands that all embassies in Kuwait close. ``This is a withdrawal
in body, not in spirit,'' said one State Department official. ``Our
people there are humans, not symbols. We're doing what's best for
them.''
   On Friday, immediately after Iraq's National Assembly approved
the dearture of more than 8,000 foreigners from Iraq and Kuwait,
U.S. envoy Joseph Wilson asked that Americans be allowed to start
leaving immediately on available commercial flights, Ms. Tutwiler
said.
   ``He urged the government of Iraq to dispense with exit visa and
passport formalities, so that people do not encounter needless
bureaucratic delays,'' she said.
   But Iraqi Foreign Ministry officials told him they will only
respond to the U.S. requests on Saturday, she said. They gave no
reason, she said, but other officials noted that Friday is Islam's
sabbath and government offices are closed.
   Tutwiler said the State Department was arranging for Iraqi
Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz's visit, probably on Dec. 17. But a
date for his meeting with Bush won't be set until Iraq sets the
date for a subsequent meeting between Secretary of State James
Baker and President Saddam Hussein in Baghdad, she said. She
declined to explain why the administration was setting such a
condition.
   The United States proposed flying all the Americans out on
planes chartered from Iraqi Airlines or from other companies it has
used before, she said.
   The main task of the diplomats in Kuwait, led by Ambassador
Nathaniel Howell, was to keep in touch with Americans and work for
their safe release, Ms. Tutwiler said. Once that mission is
accomplished, and all Americans who wish to leave Kuwait do so,
``the embassy will temporarily not be staffed because we would then
have no business to do with the Iraqi occupation forces.''
   The diplomats will remain accredited to the Kuwaiti government
exiled in Saudi Arabia.
   Two British diplomats have also been holding out at their own
embassy in Kuwait.
   The Foreign Office in London said the two British diplomats
would stay in Kuwait, regardless of the U.S. withdrawal.
   President Bush has repeatedly expressed anger at the treatment
of the U.S. diplomats, saying it violated international norms of
diplomatic behavior.
   They have been subsisting on meager rations, with their water
and electricity cut off, and prevented by Iraqi troops from leaving
the compound.
   The United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution several
weeks ago calling for the two embassies to be provided with food.
But the world body was unable to make arrangements for restocking
the two missions.
   As part of his proposal to the Iraqi Foreign Ministry, Wilson
urged that water and lights be turned on at the embassy in Kuwait
and the diplomats allowed to come and go freely so they can help in
the evacuation operation, Tutwiler said.

   Interviewed by ABC Television's ``Nightline'' program, the Iraqi
foreign minister said of the diplomats in Kuwait, ``If they leave,
they will be given all the guarantees they are asking for. The
building would be secure ... we take the responsibility for that,
you see.''
   As for Americans who have been in hiding, ``They can appear, and
leave,'' Aziz said.
   He said Iraq was still considering the State Department's

   Wilson proposed sending U.S.-chartered planes to pick up
Americans in Kuwait, Tutwiler said. From Kuwait they would be flown
to Baghdad and from there to Europe, she said.
   The State Department has also sent additional consular officers
to Jordan and asked Iraq that they be allowed to go to Baghdad and
help with the departure operation, she said.
   The State Department has been informing Americans in Iraq and
Kuwait, through broadcasts of the government's Voice of America
radio station, to stay tuned for further instructions on departure.
   The VOA has served as a channel to the Americans since the Aug.
2 invasion, when many were in hiding from Iraqi troops. The State
Department has evacuated some 2,000 Americans since the invasion
began, many of them women and children.
   Among the 750 Americans left, some may have dual citizenship -
both Iraqi and American - and may not want to leave, Tutwiler said.
Iraq is also holding 88 Americans at key installations as ``human
shields'' against U.S. attack.
   On Capitol Hill, House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., appointed
Intelligence Committee Chairman Anthony Beilenson, D-Calif., to
lead a 20-member delegation next week to Saudi Arabia and Israel.
The group will meet with Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of U.S.
forces in the region, and hopes to meet with Saudi officials. The
trip is from Dec. 11 through Dec. 15.

   Thunderstorms scattered cold rain from Mississippi and Louisiana
to the southern Atlantic Coast on Friday as a cold front curved
through the Southeast.
   Temperatures in most areas dipped into the 40s Friday afternoon,
but warm weather continued ahead of the cold front, with
temperatures rising into the 60s and 70s across the Florida
Peninsula.
   Sunny skies also prevailed across the southern Plains states.
   In the areas touched by the cold front, heavier rainfall totals
for the six-hour period ending at 1 p.m. EST included
three-quarters of an inch at Key West, Fla., and half an inch at
Albany, Ga.
   Elsewhere in the nation, gale warnings were in effect along
parts of the western Gulf Coast, including the Galveston, Texas,
area, and lake wind advisories had been issued across much of south
Texas.
   Brisk westerly winds prevailed throuhhout the central Plains and
upper Great Lakes regions.
   High temperatures Friday afternoon were in the 20s and 30s in
much of the West, and in the 30s and lower 40s from the Great Lakes
region and northern sections of the Ohio Valley to northern New
England.
   Readings were in the 40s and 50s along the Pacific Coast and
were warming into the 60s and 70s in the southwestern deserts.
   Yellowstone Park in Montana was the cold spot in the nation
Friday with a low of 12 degrees below zero.

<HEAD>Actress Margot Kidder Sues Over Injuries on Set</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actress Margot Kidder on
Friday sued the producers of a television series, claiming she may
have suffered permanent injuries in a car accident during filming.
   In a statement of claim filed Friday in British Columbia Supreme
Court, Ms. Kidder claims she has continuous muscle spasms in her
neck and back, numbness and lack of circulation in her left leg,
and nerve damage to her left arm, left shoulder and neck.
   The suit seeks damages from Toronto-based Nelvana Ltd. and N.D.
Productions B.C. Ltd. of Vancouver.
   Ms. Kidder, 42, is also seeking damages for breach of contract
and lost salary because she was allegedly fired from the series
after she was unable to work.
   Ms. Kidder, who was herself an executive producer in the series,
was to be paid $21,666 a week for 24 weeks of filming.
   The suit does not specify an amount for damages or other claims.
   Ms. Kidder claims she was injured in October while driving in a
car during filming of the first episode of the series, based on the
Nancy Drew mystery books.
   The car's brakes locked and Ms. Kidder and actress Polly Bergen
were ``thrown forward in the unsecured seat, then backwards, then
forward again,'' said Ms. Kidder's lawyer, Jack Finlay.
   Spokesmen for the defendants were not immediately available for
comment.
   The producers wrote Ms. Kidder late last month, saying they were
not responsible for her contract because she was unable to perform
for seven consecutive days, according to the document filed in
court by Finlay.
   The Canadian-born Ms. Kidder is best known for playing Lois Lane
in the ``Superman'' movies.

   Lawyers in the murder case against
Marlon Brando's son told a judge Friday that the prosecutors' star
witness - the actor's daughter - was ruled mentally incompetent by
a court in Tahiti.
   Prosecutors pressed on with efforts to get her testimony.
   Superior Court Judge Joel Rudof tentatively ruled that he would
issue an international document requesting French assistance in
returning Cheyenne Brando to the United States to testify in her
brother's trial. But Rudof didn't make that ruling final and gave
lawyers until Dec. 19 to file documents on the issue.
   Christian Brando, 32, is charged with first-degree murder in the
shooting of his sister's Tahitian lover, 26-year-old Dag Drollet,
at Marlon Brando's mansion May 16.
   Later in the day, Christian Brando's lawyer appeared in court
without his client and said he was unaware the defendant had been
ordered to appear for trial setting.
   Superior Court Judge Robert Thomas, who was to preside at the
murder trial, ordered Christian Brando to be in court Tuesday for
the setting of a new trial date. He said he was tentatively
planning to start the trial Jan. 14.
   Outside court, defense lawyer Robert Shapiro reiterated that he
is eager to settle the case without a trial, but indicated there
has been no progress in that direction.
   ``We are open to sitting down with the district attorney and
discussing a fair resolution to the case that would be fair to
Christian, fair to the prosecution and acceptable to the public,''
Shapiro said.
   At the earlier hearing concerning Cheyenne Brando, Deputy
District Attorney Steven Barshop said that in her last court
appearance in the French Polynesian territory last September, Miss
Brando said she would be willing to return and testify if her
doctors allowed it.
   ``We are operating under the assumption that she will return
voluntarily if she is subpoenaed,'' Barshop said.
   Attorney Michael Nasatir, who is representing the 20-year-old
Miss Brando, told the judge he was informed by lawyers in Tahiti
that she was placed under the guardianship of her mother, Tarita
Tarapia Brando, after a hearing in Tahiti on Thursday.
   ``She has been declared incompetent to handle her own affairs
and her child also has been put under guardianship,'' Nasatir said.
   He suggested that she should not be ordered back to the United
States because she is an unsuitable witness.
   Barshop, meanwhile, said he had no direct information yet on
what had occurred in Tahiti and wanted to press forward with the
effort quickly to get Christian Brando's trial started.
   The international tangle over Miss Brando has delayed the murder
trial, which was scheduled to start Nov. 5.
   Shortly after the shooting, she returned to Tahiti, where she
had Drollet's child, was confined to a mental hospital and at one
point was treated for a drug overdose, according to the Brando
family.
   There also was a report from a Brando family spokesman in
Papeete in November that she tried to commit suicide by hanging and
was hospitalized.
   She has refused to return to California to testify.
   Authorities in Tahiti also have barred her exit, charging her as
an accomplice in Drollet's slaying.
   Defense attorney Robert Shapiro maintains Christian Brando and
Drollet fought over a gun that accidentally went off. He suggests
Drollet's death was no more than involuntary manslaughter.

<HEAD>Widow Says Surgeon Killed by AIDS Felt Risk of Infecting Patients
was Small</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A surgeon who died of AIDS continued to treat
patients with breast cancer after learning he had the disease
because he felt the good he did them outweighed the chance he could
infect them, his widow said.
   Dr. Rudolph Almaraz, a widely respected surgeon at Johns Hopkins
died Nov. 16 of AIDS, never telling his patients or the hospital of
his illness.
   ``The risks (of infecting patients) are minimal,'' said his
wife, Betty Almaraz. ``My husband saved many, many lives, weighted
against the infinitesimal risk.''
   Johns Hopkins is sending letters to about 1,800 patients on whom
Almaraz operated, offering them AIDS testing and counseling, but
cautioning them that the chance of infection is very small.
   The case also has prompted the hospital to consider supporting a
new state law requiring health care workers to tell their
supervisors or hospitals if they are infected with communicable
diseases.
   Betty Almaraz said her husband feared ``his loss of dignity, his
loss of practice'' if he revealed that he had AIDS. But he
consulted federal health officials and doctors who cared for him
and followed their recommendations for continuing to practice
safely.
   ``He was concerned about creating mountains out of molehills,''
he said. ``There was no need to alarm these people.''
   Almaraz's lawyer, Marvin Ellin, has said the doctor got the
disease during an operation on an AIDS patient at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City in 1983. The
patient's blood squirted into Almaraz's eyes and mouth, Ellin said.
   The hospital says he never reported the exposure during the six
months he was there.
   AIDS is most commonly transmitted through homosexual contact,
the sharing of needles in intravenous drugs or in a blood
transfusion.
   Betty Almaraz said her husband didn't contract AIDS by any of
those means.

   A newspaper reporter was handcuffed
and taken to jail Friday for refusing to answer certain questions
about her interviews with a capital murder defendant.
   The Texas Court of Criminal Appeal refused later in the day to
consider an appeal, and gave no explanation.
   Earlier, an apologetic State District Judge Eric Brown gave
Libby Averyt of the Corpus Christi Caller-Times one last chance to
answer the questions before he signed an order to jail her for
contempt of court. The 26-year-old reporter again refused.
   ``Miss Averyt, it appears we are both actors playing our
parts,'' Brown told the reporter before sheriff's deputies led her
off to jail. ``We are both doing our jobs.''
   Brown ordered Averyt jailed Thursday, but did not sign the order
until Friday. The judge found her in contempt of court at a
pre-trial hearing in the murder trial of Jermarr Arnold.
   Ms. Averyt was found in contempt after she defied an ordered to
testify. Instead she invoked the First Amendment and similar
provisions of the Texas Constitution in refusing 12 times to answer
questions about her interviews with Arnold in October and November.
   Averyt and the newspaper's attorney, Jorge Rangel, maintained
that journalists should not be compelled to reveal information
obtained from news sources if that information was not published.
   But Brown said the rights of a man on trial for murder outweigh
press' privilege to withhold material.
   Attorneys for the newspaper were seeking to have Ms. Averyt
released on bond.
   Initially the judge ordered Ms. Averyt placed in the custody of
a bailiff in his court at the Nueces County Courthouse. She was
later moved to a county jail cell.
   ``Right now, today, I'm prepared to spend the weekend in jail,''
Ms. Averyt said after her appeal was refused. ``I have not changed
my mind about answering the questions ... I still have a strong
belief that if this is allowed to happen, then fewer people are
going to talk to me.''
   Nine media organizations opposed to the reporter's jailing filed
a ``friend of the court'' brief on her behalf Friday at the
Criminal Appeals Court.
   Brown ordered Ms. Averyt jailed indefinitely until she answers a
defense attorney's questions about her interviews with Arnold, who
faces trial in the 1983 slaying of 21-year-old jewelry store clerk
Christina Sanchez.
   In Ms. Averyt's reports, Arnold discussed the robbery and
slaying and expressed a lack of remorse, his belief that he
deserves the death penalty, his previous criminal activity and told
how he manipulated the insanity defense in previous trials for
other crimes.
   She conducted several interviews with Arnold at the jail and
over the telephone.
   Lewis said without Ms. Averyt's testimony, the only way he could
respond to the articles would be placing Arnold on the stand. That
would violate Arnold's Fifth Amendment right not to testify.

   The Galileo spacecraft makes a
rendezvous with Earth on Saturday, using the planet's gravity like
a slingshot to hurl it along on its six-year journey to the solar
system's largest planet, Jupiter.
   Launched in October 1989, Galileo will swoop about 593 miles
above the southwest Atlantic Ocean at 12:35 p.m. PST.
   The pass will be monitored by mission controllers at the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   During the flyby, the spacecraft will measure gases that cause
the ``greenhouse effect'' warming of Earth's atmosphere and will
study high-altitude water vapor that helps create and destroy
Earth's ozone layer, scientists said.
   Galileo will also be the first spacecraft with modern
instruments to study the far side of the moon, which always faces
away from Earth.
   On Oct. 18, 1989, Galileo was released from the cargo bay of
space shuttle Atlantis. Then its own rocket booster launched the
spacecraft on its long voyage, with arrival at Jupiter scheduled in
1995.
   In February, Galileo neared Venus for its first ``gravity
assist'' maneuver, using the planet's gravity as a slingshot to
help it reach Jupiter.
   Next Oct. 29, the spacecraft swoops within 600 miles of asteroid
Gaspra, taking pictures and measurements. Then, on Dec. 8, 1992,
Galileo zooms about 185 miles above Earth's surface in the third
and final ``gravity assist'' maneuver needed to hurl it toward
Jupiter.
   Galileo will arrive at Jupiter on Dec. 7, 1995. The spacecraft
will orbit the planet and launch a probe to plung into its
atmosphere.

<TEXT>
   Costa Rica asked Friday for the
extradition of an Iran-Contra scandal figure charged with murder,
arms and drugs trafficking and involvement in rebel operations.
   John Hull, 70, skipped $12,500 bail in July 1989 while awaiting
trial. He has been living most recently in rented homes in
Juigalpa, about 85 miles east of Managua.
   Hull, a millionaire U.S. emigre who became a naturalized Costa
Rican in 1984, allegedly allowed the CIA use of air strips on his
Costa Rican farms to resupply the Contra rebels in Nicaraguan in
1984 and 1985.
   A foreign ministry news release said the Costa Rican extradition
request was turned over to the Supreme Court, which oversees such
cases under a 1925 extradition treaty between the two countries.
   Hull, originally from Princeton, Ind., had been living in Costa
Rica for 20 years.
   But Hull seemed to have disappeared again. Reporters could not
find him at his home in Juigalpa, and some journalists were told he
had recently left the country, traveling by land with his adopted
daughter Emily.
   Hull was an open admirer of the U.S.-backed Contras while they
fought for nine years with against the leftist Sandinista
government.
   The Contras were disbanded in June, about two months after
President Violeta Chamorro took office.
   During the guerrilla war, Costa Rica tried to remain neutral
even though the rebels operated openly from camps near the
Nicaraguan border.
   The charges against Hull stem from his alleged involvement in
CIA operations to supply the Contras. The charges are listed in the
news release as ``hostile acts against the state, premeditated
homicide and illicit trafficking in drugs and weapons.''
   Hull was also implicated in the 1984 assassination attempt
against former Contra leader Eden Pastora. Five journalists,
including an American woman, were killed and more than 20 people
were wounded when a bomb went off in Pastora's camp at the border
town of La Penca.
   Since he arrived in Nicaragua five months ago, Hull has avoided
the media.
   Friends said he was planning to buy a cattle ranch. He was also
organizing donations to the Juigalpa hospital, but otherwise kept
much to himself.
   Costa Rican ambassador Carlos Aguilar said he last saw Hull in
Managua on Tuesday ``by pure chance.''
   ``He drove past me in his pickup truck,'' Aguilar said.

<TEXT>
   Henry Lee Lucas, who once claimed he
killed nearly 600 people in 26 states, was extradited to Florida on
Friday to stand trial in four slayings.
   Lucas was brought from Texas, where he had been scheduled to die
by lethal injection on Monday.
   The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals on Nov. 29 granted Lucas a
stay in the 1979 slaying of an unidentified woman known as ``orange
socks,'' the only clothing she was wearing when found.
   Lucas, 54, was indicted in May 1989 in the 1980-81 slayings of
four people in the Florida Panhandle.
   ``We are gratified that this brutal case will finally come to
trial, allowing the communities and families involved to once and
for all put this matter behind them,'' said Commissioner Tim Moore
of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.
   No trial dates had been set.
   The Florida indictments accuse Lucas of first-degree murder in
the Dec. 15, 1980, shooting of gas station attendant John P.
McDaniel Jr. of Jackson County; the Feb. 10, 1981, shooting of
Jerilyn Murphy Peoples at her Holmes County home; the March 25,
1981, strangulation and stabbing of Brenda Jo Burton in Holmes
County; and the April 9, 1981, slaying of Mary Ruby McCary,
Washington County.
   Besides the death sentence in Texas, Lucas was sentenced to six
life prison terms, two 75-year sentences and a 60-year term for
other convictions.
   Lucas said in a recent prison interview that he was anxious to
deal with the other cases.
   ``They're just conspiring to get all the unsolved murders pinned
on me,'' he said. ``I can't see why they're spending all this money
on me and let guilty people run free.''
   After the one-eyed drifter recanted his claims of nearly 600
murders, he said he actually was guilty of only one - that of his
mother in Michigan in 1960. His former companion, Ottis Elwood
Toole, 43, is imprisoned at Florida State Prison in Starke serving
a life sentence on murder and arson charges.
   Toole accused Lucas in court documents of some of the Florida
killings, while Frank Powell III, the brother of Lucas' former
girlfriend, told investigators of the murder of Mrs. Peoples.
   Lucas has accused the pair of lying.
   ``I'd tell them to get their stories straight and quit lying
about all these unsolved murders,'' he said.

   The United States will give away
thousands of tanks, armored vehicles and artillery pieces to help
smaller NATO allies upgrade their forces, officials said Friday.
   The United States will give 2,000 M-60 tanks to Greece,
Portugal, Spain and Turkey; 600 M-113 armored combat vehicles to
Greece, Italy, Norway and Spain; and 180 M-110 howitzers to
Denmark, Greece and Turkey.
   The equipment became available last month when NATO and the
eight Warsaw Pact nations signed a treaty cutting conventional arms
in Europe.
   The 16-nation NATO alliance will meet the treaty's arms ceilings
through destruction of the older equipment.
   The transfers, part of a plan to standardize equipment across
the alliance, were approved at a meeting of NATO defense ministers
Friday.
   NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner said the donations were
evidence of ``close cooperation'' within the alliance.
   Germany, the Netherlands and Italy - which also must reduce
their forces under the conventional arms treaty - plan to make
smaller transfers of sophisticated equipment to other NATO members.
   Officials said Germany will give 400 Leopard I tanks to Denmark,
Greece and Turkey; 500 armoured vehicles to Greece and Turkey; and
150 artillery pieces to Greece, Portugal and Turkey.
   They said the Netherlands will transfer 130 armoured vehicles to
Portugal and 100 tanks to Greece.
   Italy will give 100 armored vehicles to Turkey, they said.

   A jury on Friday awarded more than $3.5
million to a man who sued Roman Catholic authorities, saying he had
been sexually abused by a priest when he was a boy.
   The man, who is now 24, was abused during his boyhood by the
Rev. Thomas Adamson, who was pastor at a church in the Twin Cities
suburb of Columbia Heights, according to undisputed testimony in
the case.
   The man and his parents filed suit against the Roman Catholic
archdiocese in St. Paul-Minneapolis and the diocese in the
southeastern Minnesota city of Winona. The man has asked to remain
anonymous.
   The Anoka County jury said the Archdiocese of St.
Paul-Minneapolis and the Diocese of Winona together were 85 percent
negligent and the man and his parents were each 5 percent
negligent.
   Jurors decided on punitive damages against the archdiocese of $2
million and punitive damages against the Winona diocese of
$700,000.
   The jury also decided on $855,000 in compensatory damages for
the victim's past and future pain and disability, embarrassment and
emotional distress, medical and therapy expenses and loss of
earnings.
   Both the church bodies were deciding whether to appeal.
   Archbishop John Roach said he was disappointed with the verdict.
The victim deserves some compensation but no punitive damages,
Roach said.
   ``In the case of punitive damages, it's very clear to me there
will be an appeal,'' Roach said.
   The plaintiff and his parents have alleged throughout the
five-week trial that the archdiocese and the diocese showed willful
indifference by failing to remove Adamson from duty when they knew
about Adamson's 20-year history of abusing boys.
   Church attorneys had admitted the archdiocese and diocese were
partly responsible for the plaintiff's psychological problems but
denied they willfully employed an unfit priest.
   Adamson had admitted sexual misconduct with boys in the Winona
Diocese beginning in 1961 and in the Twin Cities archdiocese after
his 1975 transfer.
   The man's attorney, Jeffrey Anderson, had argued that Adamson's
long-term and frequent abuse of the plaintiff ``irrevocably twisted
and distorted'' the plaintiff's emotional growth.
   Anderson asked for more than $2 million in damages to compensate
the plaintiff. He sought an additional $3.5 million dollars in
punitive damages.
   The plaintiff, who was 13 when the abuse began, cried as the
verdict was read and was still teary-eyed as he left the courtroom.
When asked how he felt, he replied, ``Nervous.''
   ``He's going through a vindication,'' Anderson said of his
client. ``Now he's been told he's been vindicated. Having this over
with will be very therapeutic.''
   Anderson said the jury ``did what we asked, to compensate our
client, and sent a message that (this kind of action) should
stop.''
   He added, ``I think the verdict sends a real significant message
and I'm in no way disappointed.''
   Roach, the spiritual leader of an estimated 665,000 Roman
Catholics in the Twin Cities area, said the awarding of punitive
damages ``ignores the actions w took nearly a decade ago'' to
prevent similar cases of abuse.
   ``Our decisions certainly did not represent either willful
indifference or reckless employment,'' Roach said.
   Kevin McDonough, chancellor of the archdiocese, said church
leaders changed the way they screen candidates for the priesthood
and have increased awareness of sexual abuse among priests.

   House Democrats Friday unanimously nominated
Rep. Dan Blue to become the state's first black speaker.
   If elected on Jan. 30, Blue would become the nation's fourth
black state speaker ever. The others are Willie Brown, California's
current speaker, the Rev. S. Howard Woodson, who served as New
Jersey's speaker from 1974-1975, and K. Leroy Irvis, who served as
Pennsylvania's speaker from 1977 to 1988.
   The nomination by the Democrat-controlled House nearly ensures
election.
   ``As I indicated during this campaign for speaker, I promise
fairness to all members,'' Blue said after all 79 Democrats at the
caucus backed his bid. ``And I do intend to fulfill that promise.''
   He said Republican members ``will be accorded the respect and
levels of leadership and responsibility commensurate with the many
talents they bring to the Legislature.''
   But he said Democrats, who control 81 of 120 House seats, will
``have the leadership positions to control and manage the flow of
legislation and assume the primary responsibility for the strengths
and weaknesses of the House efforts during the next session.''
   Blue, 42, is a 10-year veteran of the House from Wake County.

   A jury found Soldier of Fortune magazine
liable for $12.4 million in damages Friday because a ``gun for
hire'' ad was linked to the 1985 killing of a businessman.
   In the U.S. District Court case, brothers Michael and Ian Braun
pinned the death of their father, Richard Braun, on a classified ad
placed in the magazine's June 1985 issue by Richard Savage. The ad
offered Savage's services as a ``gun for hire.'' The Brauns
contended their father's business associate, Bruce Gastwirth, used
the ad to arrange to have Braun killed.
   In closing arguments Friday, the magazine argued the publication
should not be held liable and that publishers have no duty to
research the background of advertisers.
   Magazine founder and publisher Robert Brown pledged to appeal.

   A newspaper reporter was jailed for
contempt of court Friday for refusing to answer questions about her
interviews with a murder defendant.
   Libby Averyt, 26, of the Corpus Christi Caller-Times, has
maintained along with her newspaper that journalists should not be
compelled to reveal information from sources if that information
was not published.
   The state district court case concerns Ms. Averyt's interviews
with Jermarr Arnold, who is accused in the 1983 slaying of a
jewelry store clerk. In her newspaper articles, Ms. Averyt reported
Arnold's discussion of the robbery and slaying, his lack of remorse
and his belief that he deserves the death penalty.
   The defense argues that without Ms. Averyt's testimony, Arnold
may have to take the stand. That would violate Arnold's Fifth
Amendment right not to testify.

   A jury awarded $6 million Friday to a state
supreme court justice after finding The Philadelphia Inquirer
defamed him in a reprint of a 1983 series about court conduct.
   The Common Pleas Court jury found the reprint, which included an
editorial and a cartoon, was false and defamatory, but that the
original series was not false.
   Justice James T. McDermott sued on grounds the articles, titled
``Above the Law,'' implied he fixed cases.
   The justice said that ``never, ever'' did he have financial
ties, receive personal gifts or have any conflicts of interest with
anyone involved in cases before the Supreme Court.
   It was the second libel judgment against the Inquirer this year.
Last May, a jury awarded Philadelphia lawyer Richard Sprague a
record $34 million over a 1973 story that criticized his handling
of a homicide case when he was an assistant district attorney.
   The Inquirer is appealing both awards.

<HEAD>University Fails to Keep Ethan Allen Letter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The University of Vermont failed at an auction
Friday to keep a letter by Ethan Allen in the state.
   The $38,000 winning bid for the 1787 letter by the Vermont
patriot was made by a New York dealer for a private manuscript
library in Santa Barbara, Calif. A 10 percent commission brought
the price to $41,800 at Christie's.
   Montreal antiquarian book dealer Helen Kahn said she bid just
over $30,000 on the school's behalf but could not go higher.
   ``We were quite disappointed,'' she said. ``We thought it
belonged in Vermont.''
   Bart Auerbach, the New York dealer, said he bought the
manuscript for the Karpeles Manuscript Library, a private
institution owned by Dave Karpeles. The library is open to the
public.
   The letter had a pre-sale catalog estimate of $15,000 to
$20,000.
   The university raised as much as $15,000 from individual
collectors and small foundations in Vermont to buy the letter, in
which Allen discusses a possible trade agreement between
independent Vermont and Canada.
   Vermont became part of the United States in 1791. Allen had led
the Greem Mountain Boys in a famous raid on Fort Ticonderoga during
the American Revolution.
   Thelletter shows a blending of Allen's personal and public
goals, said Kevin Graffagnino, curator of the Vermont collection at
the university.
   Because Allen and his brother, Ira, owned 300,000 acres in
Franklin and Chittenden counties, the Allens wanted to make sure
Vermont could trade timber and goods freely to the north, he said.
   Allen encouraged trade concessions between Vermont and Canada
because his land would rise greatly in value, Graffagnino said, and
also because that was what he thought was right for Vermont.
   In the letter, Allen makes it clear that Vermont is an
independent republic and thus is free to make its own international
decisions.
   ``I belong to this republic, which is not connected with the
United States of America,'' Allen wrote to Guy Carleton, Lord
Dorchester, former British military leader and Britain's governor
of Quebec at the time.
   The British never did give the trade concessions and the Allens
fell into debt with Montreal businessmen.
   The university has the most extensive collection of Allen papers
in the world and officials were eager to buy the document and have
it on display for the state's bicentennial next year.
   The university this year paid $13,000 for a letter Allen wrote
in 1775.

   Chairs touched by famous derrieres - from pop
star Madonna to first lady Barbara Bush to Chicago White Sox
catcher Carlton Fisk - went on the auction block in a benefit that
raised more than $5,000 to feed the hungry.
   In all, 32 pieces of celebrity seating were sold Thursday night
for $5,085 to support the Greater Chicago Food Depository, which
distributes 20 million pounds of food a year in northeast Illinois
and northwest Indiana.
   ``I was amazed. I didn't think we'd do so well,'' said
auctioneer Leslie Hindman, whose Antique Center gallery was the
site of the event. ``You can never tell how it will go with a
charity auction.''
   A seat on which Madonna sat during a dinner at Carlucci's
restaurant in 1988 brought $225. And a black rocker used by Mrs.
Bush when she read to children during a stop on her literacy
campaign fetched $60.
   Fisk's leather-padded folding chair from the dressing room of
historic Comiskey Park was the biggest money-maker. It prompted a
bidding war won by Maggie Bobbitt, an accounting firm manager who
plunked down $1,150 for it.
   Close behind the Fisk chair was a visitors' chair from the
Chicago mayor's office dating to the era of the late Richard J.
Daley. It brought $1,050 from Ron Onesti, 28, a Chicago
sporting-goods store owner.

   Hundreds of anti-war demonstrators rallied outside the Wisconsin
state Capitol and dozens more activists were arrested in Seattle on
Friday during protests against the U.S. military buildup in the
Persian Gulf.
   ``I am against all wars,'' former Army Reservist Stephanie
Atkinson told protesters gathered at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in Cambridge, Mass. ``I'm especially against this one.
It's imperialistic. There really is no good reason for them to be
there.''
   Ms. Atkinson, 23, said her former unit is now 20 miles from the
Kuwait border. She said she was discharged under ``other than
honorable conditions'' for her effort to get conscientious objector
status.
   In Seattle, about three dozen people were arrested when they
blocked a main street in front of the U.S. Naval Reserve building.
They were expected to be cited for interfering with traffic, police
spokesman Mark Amundson said.
   In Madison, Wis., about 350 people marched from the state
Capitol to a federal building two blocks away while protesting
President Bush's response to Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   ``The president has unleashed a war machine and propaganda
campaign to silence the peace movement,'' Democratic Rep. David
Clarenbach told the crowd. ``The parallels with the war in Vietnam
are all to painful and obvious.''
   Organizers of the demonstrations said soldiers and veterans
across the nation are beginning to join students and liberal
activists in protests against the deployement of U.S. troops in the
Middle East.
   ``There's a growing movement inside the armed forces'' against
military action in the gulf, said Scott Cooper, a coordinator of
the Committee Against a Vietnam War in the Middle East, which
organized the ``speak-out'' attended by about 200 people at MIT.
   Although most protesters are white and middle-class, minority
communities oppose the military buildup since they are the ones who
will be hardest hit, said Shakur Ali, a veteran who attended the
MIT gathering. Ali said he served three tours of combat duty in
Vietnam.
   ``A lot of minorities went over there not really knowing the
horrors of war they might be facing. Before I went over (to
Vietnam), I saw John Wayne. When you're actually there, putting a
body in the body bag, it's not Hollywood,'' he said.
   Colclough, a former student at St. Lawrence University, is
awaiting a decision on his application for conscientious objector
status. He wants a complete withdrawal of troops from the gulf.
   ``We have no right to be there,'' said Colclough, 21, of
Saugerties, N.Y.
   In the last two months, he said he's seen attendance at anti-war
rallies increase from mostly Vietnam veterans and former
anti-Vietnam war activists to young people and parents of
reservists called up for duty.
   ``I feel the government is way out of touch with the people on
this. It's being fought by the people, not for the people,'' he
said.
   At the University of California, Berkeley, Tahan Jones, a Marine
reservist corporal who has applied for conscientious objector
status, was scheduled to speak against U.S. intervention in the
gulf.
   On Monday, the Twin Cities area is scheduled to begin a week of
protest, featuring Eric Larson, a Marine who has refused to be
deployed, according to organizer Lynn Henderson of the Persian Gulf
Crisis Committee.
   In another protest, Coretta Scott King, wife of the slain civil
rights leader, and Joseph E. Lowery, president of the Southern
Christian Leader Conference, said they were summoning a group of
civil rights activists to the United Nations in New York on Monday.
   Members of the National Coalition of Conscience are to meet at
the United Nations Plaza on Monday, Human Rights Day to speak out
against a UN resolution threatening force against Iraq, said a
statement Lowery issued in Atlanta on Friday.
   Such protests, organizers said, have been growing in size and
number since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and subsequent deployment of
U.S. troops to Saudi Arabia.
   A New York-based anti-war coalition is readying plans for a
major march on Washington Jan. 26, according to San Francisco-based
activist Scott Mackler.
   ``This is the first time in modern history that one generation
(of protesters) has emerged out of another,'' said Mackler. ``The
young people being drafted to the Middle East are the product of
parents who fought in the Vietnam War.''
   Organizers are stressing unity among protesters and soldiers in
the gulf.
   ``We're the real supporters of the troops. We want to bring them
home,'' said Henderson.
   He said student protesters ``don't want to give any concession
to the argument we're not supporting our troops.''

   The Baghdad government says hundreds of Americans and other
Western hostages can begin leaving this weekend, but it also has
sent 30,000 more troops to the Arabian desert, showing no intention
to abandon Kuwait.
   Pentagon spokesman Bob Hall said the reinforcements, bringing
the Iraqi buildup in Kuwait and southern Iraq to 480,000 soldiers,
apparently were trucked into position over recent days.
   An additional 10,000 U.S. troops also arrived in the Persian
Gulf, Hall said. The 350,000-strong multinational force now
includes about 250,000 Americans, most of them dug into the Saudi
Arabian desert facing Iraqi troops.
   President Bush has promised to have 440,000 Americans stationed
around the gulf by mid-January. The U.N. resolution approved last
week authorizes the use of force to drive Iraq from Kuwait after
Jan. 15.
   ---&equals;
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Given Saddam Hussein's record, the Bush
administration is offering a subdued response to Baghdad's surprise
announcement that all 900 Americans held in Iraq and Kuwait will be
freed.
   The hostages' release is one of the three principal U.S. demands
made of the Iraqi president since his lightning takeover of Kuwait
in August. President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III
still insist on fulfillment of the other two - a total withdrawal
and restoration of the overthrown Kuwaiti government.
   Freeing the hostages, including 88 held as human shields at
strategic locations, could serve Saddam's purposes by contributing
to the rising opposition among Congress and the public to a use of
military force.
   With the Iraqi leader capitulating to one demand, why not wait
for the worldwide trade embargo and other economic sanctions to
squeeze Saddam into giving up Kuwait?
   ---&equals;
   WASHINGTON (AP) - The attack on Pearl Harbor 49 years ago today
was linked more closely than commonly believed to Japan's thirst
for secure oil supplies, according to a new book that draws
haunting parallels to the Persian Gulf crisis.
   In ``The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power''
published this week, author Daniel Yergin called oil the
``linchpin'' of Japan's strategy for Asian conquest and the trigger
for its stunning attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941.
   The assault on the U.S. Pacific Fleet killed 2,335 American
servicemen and 68 civilians.
   Yergin's book, which was seven years in the making, cites the
Pacific campaign as one of many examples from the 20th century of
oil's crucial and painful role in global and regional conflict. It
draws parallels to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, calling it a
high-stakes gamble by a militaristic ruler bent on capturing new
oil wealth in order to widen his regional domination.

   The formula used to distribute federal health
care money for the needy underpays poor states while favoring
richer ones, the General Accounting Office said today.
   The congressional investigative agency, in testimony prepared
for a House panel, said the government should replace the per
capita income formula for making Medicaid payments and reduce the
minimum federal share.
   ``The formula does not target most federal funds to states with
the greatest needs ... those with weak tax bases and high
concentrations of poor people,'' the GAO's Janet Shikles told the
Government Operations subcommittee on human resources and
intergovernmental relations.
   The government should shift to a formula using the number of
people in poverty in a state combined with the total availability
of ``taxable resources,'' such as business earnings and dividends
distributed to out-of-state shareholders, she said.

   Americans in the nation's biggest cities killed each other in
record numbers this year, a rise in carnage police blame on guns,
drugs and a declining reverence for human life.
   Not all cities had increased killings, but the number of
homicides in the 20 largest cities in 1990 has surpassed the 1989
total by 3 percent, and the year is not yet over. Police in those
20 cities have recorded 7,698 homicides so far this year.
   New York City recorded its 2,000th violent death of the year
last weekend, when seven people were killed in one night. The city
had long since surpassed its old record of 1,905 homicides, set
just last year.
   Washington, D.C.'s, mark of 434 homicides fell late last month,
making it likely that the nation's capital, which has the highest
per-capita homicide rate, would remain the murder capital as well.

   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) - Columbia's astronauts were back
star-gazing today after scientists on the ground fired up the $150
million Astro observatory, which has been crippled by repeated
malfunctions.
   Troubles have persisted throughout the mission and have forced
the astronauts to skip more than 100 planned observations. About
250 celestial targets were to have been studied.
   The latest problem occurred Thursday when a backup computer
terminal aboard the spacecraft that had been running the
observatory's three ultraviolet telescopes overheated and shut
down. The other computer terminal failed Sunday.
   Lint, which can accumulate from such items as astronauts'
clothing, paper products and hand towels on the shuttle, was found
clogging the air vents of the first failed terminal, flight
director Gary Coen said. He said the second terminal hadn't been
fully inspected yet.

   On a brisk fall weekend, thousands of people
streamed up a stone stairway to a 350-year-old tomb honoring the
man who, far more than microchips or management systems, created
modern Japan.
   The tomb of Shogun Ieyasu Tokugawa and a gold-encrusted shrine
sit in a forest 70 miles northeast of Tokyo. The shogun was
promoted in death from man to god and is known as Gongen-sama,
``Protector of the Realm.''
   For many visitors, the journey may be just an opportunity to
view the autumn foliage, but another impulse sends even retired
people and young couples with toddlers up the 530-foot stairway.
   ``Wherever you go in Japan, there's evidence of the Tokugawa
era, so a lot of people are curious to see this place,'' said
Tsuchiyasu Kiyomitsu, a 30-year-old businessman who rested as other
visitors rang a long-corded bell and paid obeisance.
   The big-bellied shogun was a warlord of legendary willpower who
completed the unification of Japan in 1600 and virtually cut it off
from the world.
   Japan's isolation lasted 268 years, and the family dynasty he
founded deified Tokugawa after his death to help legitimize itself.
   During the long period of isolation, Japan created its own brand
of capitalism, including the world's first futures market (in
rice). It also refined the group behavior that still distinguishes
Japanese society, scholars say.
   Under the Tokugawas, Japan began evolving the paternalistic,
protected-market economy that has confounded policy makers in
Washington, inspired Japan-bashing around the world and helped make
the small archipelago very rich.
   Not surprisingly for Japan, where families routinely trace their
ancestry back for centuries, the Tokugawa legacy exists in the
flesh as well as in folklore.
   Had the dynasty not been overthrown in 1868, the man who might
be shogun today is Tsunenari Tokugawa, 50, current head of the
family. He manages North American operations for Nippon Yusen, a
Tokyo-based shipping company.
   ``Basically, everything that you call Japanese, our weaknesses
and our strong points, many of them in a sense matured in this
260-year period,'' he told an interviewer in his Tokyo office.
   ``Maybe we matured too strongly,'' he added with a smile,
referring to international criticism of Japan's economic practices.
   Tsunenari Tokugawa, a child of postwar egalitarian Japan, gave
an embarrassed laugh about his aristocratic lineage and pointed out
that he goes to work every day like any other ``salaryman.''
   The executive, whose wide eyes and broad face resemble portraits
of Ieyasu Tokugawa, acknowledged that he and other scions of old
feudal families often discuss the imprint his ancestors made.
   ``Whether we like it or not, we are still living under the long
line of Tokugawa influence,'' he said. ``That includes many, many,
many things: the way we think, the way we form teamwork, our system
of education.''
   Perhaps the most enduring legacy developed from a clever method
Ieyasu Tokugawa and his descendants used to stay in power, scholars
say. They kept the feudal domains they controlled off balance by
forcing each daimyo, or lord, to spend half the year in Tokyo.
   This created a nationwide capital network, since money had to
move in and out of Tokyo to support the pilgrimages.
   Fierce competition arose between domain governments and group
allegiance developed within them. The competition led each domain
to promote industry and agriculture, in part to pay for the
expensive journeys.
   ``The domain governments were strongly paternalistic,'' wrote
Marius Jansen, a Princeton University expert on Tokugawa Japan.
   ``They instituted monopolies in whatever was profitable for
export (to other domains). It is no accident that one of the great
modern firms, that of Mitsubishi, had its origins in such an
administrative arrangement.''
   Friends and colleagues tease Tsunenari Tokugawa about the
``shogun business'' he must attend to. On each anniversary of
Ieyasu's death, he goes to the Nikko shrine and dons the
traditional court costume.
   This year, the government called upon him to help celebrate the
400th anniversary of Tokyo, the city Ieyasu founded and made the
capital of Japan.
   Every March 1, Tokyo fishermen practice one of the more obscure
traditions binding Shogun Ieyasu Tokugawa to modern Japan. They
deliver a load of fresh whitebait to Tsunenari's home as
compensation for the fishing rights his ancestors granted theirs.
   ``These things are not really for the Tokugawa family,''
Tsunenari Tokugawa said. ``In a sense, it's in order for them to
prove their identity.''

   There are times when the best intentions on TV
go poof due to such things as a feeble script and acting that is
not so hot. Case in point: ``The Dreamer of Oz: The L. Frank Baum
Story'' tonight on NBC.
   The movie stars John Ritter as Baum, the failed businessman and
perennial optimist who wrote ``The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,'' a
lovely book that has enchanted generations of children since it was
published in 1900.
   With Annette O'Toole as Maud, his loving wife, it features
brightly colored fantasy trips into the tales of Dorothy, the Tin
Man, the Scarecrow and the Cowardly Lion that he first spun for his
sons and other tykes.
   But the expeditions only suffer with the inevitable comparisons
one keeps making mentally with the 1939 movie musical classic ``The
Wizard of Oz.''
   That isn't the only problem. A more serious one is Jack Bender's
direction of NBC's two-hour movie. It's oddly flat. This is a story
that should crackle with life. Instead, it just bobs amiably along.
   Even Ritter, who has a gift for playfulness in his acting,
generally seems wooden, even when surrounded by kids.
   It's not that ``Dreamer,'' written by Richard Matheson, doesn't
have a heart. It's that it has so much heart - including an
unspecified heart ailment that eventually does in author Baum - it
almost makes you want to pick it up and say:
   ``Take two tablespoons of Wicked Witch High-Test Elixir every 10
minutes and you'll be just fine.''
   Baum's tale is told through the memories of Maud, starting in
1939 at the Hollywood premiere of ``The Wizard of Oz'' (like that
movie, the opening and closing scenes of tonight's effort are
filmed in black and white).
   Now old, white-haired and 20 years a widow, Maud quietly arrives
at the premiere. She's spotted by a young reporter who, by golly,
once did a term paper on Baum's children's books. He starts asking
questions.
   Thus begins a fairly conventional account of Baum's life and
struggles, starting with his courtship of Maud when he was a
struggling actor and she a college student enchanted by his magical
story-telling abilities.
   In due course, he proposes marriage. She accepts. Her stunned
mother (Rue McClanahan), an ardent 19th century feminist, violently
objects: ``You want to give up your education to marry an actor?''
   She's right, he sighs shortly afterwards, telling his beloved:
``It is true. I am an actor. I have nothing. All I can offer you is
my heart.''
   They used this kind of stilted dialogue in the fine John Wayne
Western ``True Grit,'' but in the spirit of fun. Here, they usually
do it in the spirit of serious.
   The movie chronicles Baum's restlessness, his move in the late
1880s with his family from the East to South Dakota, and how he
doted on Dorothy, his 6-year-old niece who became the centerpiece
of his best-known book.
   It also tells of his inspiration for the book's other characters
and title, his evolution into a writer, his sorrows, his struggles,
his devotion to his family, and yes, Maud's unbending belief, even
in the darkest moments, that ``The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'' would
triumph.
   Too bad most of the telling, to put it gently, is dull. It's a
sweet drama, done with the best of intentions, a traditional belief
in happy endings and even a few Munchkins.
   But ... well, let's put it this way: Ding, dong, the script is
dead.
   ---
   Elsewhere in television ...
   SURE CURE FOR BAH, HUMBUG: If you have the premium cable channel
Showtime, don't miss tonight's broadcast of a half-hour Yuletide
music special, ``A Broadway Christmas.'' No matter that the title
should be ``A West End Christmas.'' The singing is done by the
London casts - who appear in the costumes of their shows - of such
hits as ``Les Miserables,'' ``Cats'' and the Broadway-bound ``Miss
Saigon.''
   Granted, most Christmas specials don't really decorate one's
mind. But this one does. It's magnificent work, backed by lush,
imaginative orchestral arrangements.
   Profits from the show, which will be repeated Dec. 13, 18, 23
and 25, will go to the Save The Children foundation, which also
will share the profits from cassettes and compact discs of a longer
version of tonight's singing. Titled ``Save The Children Christmas
Carols and Festive Songs,'' that collection includes a particularly
lovely new tune, ``Let's Pretend.'' It's sung by ``Phantom of the
Opera'' star Michael Crawford, who is backed by a sweet-voiced
collection of urchins.

<HEAD>Producers Boycotting Big Apple in Contract Squabble</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Jaynne in 4th graf is cq.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By PAUL GEITNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The movie crews seemed to be everywhere this
summer, but now the streets of New York are strangely quiet - the
result of an unofficial boycott by producers seeking concessions
from the trade unions.
   Studio executives agree there's no place like the Big Apple for
urban grit and grandeur. But they say the high costs of shooting
here have forced them to look for stand-in locations.
   ``New York is unique. New York is special,'' said Joel Grossman,
vice president for labor relations at Columbia Pictures. ``We want
to shoot in New York. But not at any price.''
   Feature film production generated $187 million in spending in
New York last year, said Jaynne Keyes, director of the Mayor's
Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting.
   This past summer was the city's biggest ever for feature films,
from the Bronx County courthouse, where ``Bonfire of the Vanities''
ignited sparks of protest, to the Brooklyn Bridge, closed for six
nights to accommodate the new Bruce Willis thriller, ``Hudson
Hawk.''
   But aside from some small, independent productions and Woody
Allen's new movie, Keyes said no major studio has come to the city
to shoot a film since contracts with the International Alliance of
Theatrical and Stage Employees expired Oct. 30.
   Instead, ``New York'' movies are going elsewhere. The upcoming
``Rage in Harlem'' with Gregory Hines and Robin Givens, is filming
in Cincinnati. ``29th Street'' is being shot in North Carolina.
   Winter is traditionally a slow period because of the weather.
``But if this ... is continuing in the spring when everyone is
preparing their new films, then I'm going to get very worried,''
Keyes said.
   Negotiations with Local 52, which represents about 2,000 grips,
electricians, sound and video technicians and others, broke down
Oct. 24. Negotiations with Local 644, representing some 1,500
camera operators, broke down Dec. 4.
   Both unions have filed charges of unfair labor practices with
the National Labor Relations Board. Local 52 covers the city and
Long Island. Local 644's jurisdiction stretches across the East
Coast.
   Producers want the two locals to agree to the same concessions
they got from unions on the West Coast two years ago.
   Those include the right to work any eight hours out of 24, and
any five days out of seven, before overtime starts. Current rules
require crews be paid at double-time for all night and weekend
shifts - the only times much location work can be done.
   Local 644 business representative Lou D'Agostino said he might
accept the changes in return for the much-more-comprehensive health
plan the West Coast unions get, but the studios have refused.
   ``They want us to give up approximately 30 to 40 percent of our
pay, and get nothing in return, in an industry that's probably one
of the most profitable in the United States,'' D'Agostino said.
   The average Local 644 member makes about $28,000 a year, he
said.
   In the past, producers from the major studios have continued to
work in New York under terms of the old contracts while
negotiations continued, making any changes retroactive. But this
time studio executives, who bargain jointly for the sake of
convenience, walked away from the bargaining table, taking the work
with them.
   ``This is a different ball game,'' Grossman said. ``The unions
have said very clearly that this time they're not prepared to agree
to these concessions.''
   No studio wants their multimillion-dollar movie to be held up by
a strike, he said.
   ``If they do not agree to our concessions and New York is not a
competitive place to shoot films, then the studios won't come here
to shoot,'' Grossman said. ``That's not a threat, it's just a
business reality.''
   The unions and city boosters believe film companies won't be
able to stick with a boycott of New York for long because the
movie-going public demands authenticity.
   ``There is something that New York does on film that no other
city does,'' Keyes said. ``There is an energy here that you can
feel in the city that is duplicated on screen.''
   New York also has a unique mix of people and places.
   ``If you don't like the location on one street in New York, turn
the corner and you have a completely different location,'' said
John Oates, president of IATSE Local 52. ``It's the best back lot
in the world.''
   But producers believe they can duplicate the ``New York'' feel
elsewhere. The Academy Award-winning ``Moonstruck'' was shot
largely in Toronto. ``Look Who's Talking,'' one of last year's
biggest moneymakers, was shot entirely in Vancouver, British
Columbia.
   ``The movie-going audience is happy to accept other stand-ins
for New York,'' Grossman said.
   Even Keyes, whose job it is to tout New York's charm and woo
moviemakers here, admits things don't look good.
   ``I always say you can buy three polyester blouses or one silk
one - the silk one is New York,'' she said. ``In these economic
times, people may just need to buy a polyester blouse.''

<HEAD>Alchemy: Company Offers Way To Turn Garbage into Gold</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>GLASTONBURY, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Neighbors of Peter Sellow's company
don't seem to mind that he turns mountains of ripe garbage and
sewer sludge into compost. That's probably because they can't smell
it.
   Sellow's company has borrowed from history, exploiting what he
calls an age-old farmers' secret for taking the barnyard stench out
of composting, now one of the fastest growing methods for
environmentally sensitive garbage disposal.
   His story begins in 1977, when the one-time nursery owner was
bagging homemade compost, and a tip from a chicken farmer took him
to Japan.
   There, he found the technology for an indoor composting system
that turned sewage sludge, yard clippings and other waste into
nutrient-rich compost, without the suffocating aroma usually
produced.
   Sellow updated the Japanese technology to meet American
waste-disposal problems and patented it. In 1982, he founded
International Process Systems Inc. to sell design plans and
equipment for composting plants to towns and private companies.
   ``Composting is as old as mankind,'' said Archie Albright, the
company's president and chief operating officer. ``By using
composting, we're solving an enormous problem in a cost-effective
and environmentally safe way.''
   The company was in the right place at the right time last year
when the Connecticut Legislature enacted a mandatory recycling law
that takes effect Jan. 1.
   Its customers include the town of Fairfield, which last year
opened what local officials say was the first municipal composting
plant in New England.
   Many companies compost yard wastes alone, Albright said. But
only about a half-dozen companies in the country offer ways to
combine sewage sludge with garbage and trash to form an odor-free,
safe compost, he said.
   For years, farmers have mixed manure and dead crops and allowed
the mixture to dry and break down on open land, creating a rich
fertilizer for the next planting seaso..
   The modern-day recipe calls for sewage sludge and yard waste,
plus any variety of newspapers, office paper and cardboard, along
with run-of-the-mill garbage like last night's leftovers.
   The technology is relatively simple.
   Mounds of garbage go into a giant mixing machine. The blend is
dumped into a concrete bay. Agitators churn it, moving it slowly
through a conveyor system as blowers add oxygen.
   After about three weeks, the original mess has been turned into
compost ready to be bagged and sold.
   Compost itself doesn't smell: it's basically just dirt. It's
getting the compost from garbage and sewage sludge that produces
the foul smell.
   The odor is kept inside the composting plants through negative
air pressure: when the doors are opened, air is sucked in, not out.
Also, fans blow oxygen through the plant, and the exhaust air is
pumped through bio-filters containing tiny bacteria that eat the
stuff that smells.
   The town of Fairfield turned to the company IPS in 1988. The
local landfill was nearing capacity and the town faced trucking its
waste to the trash-to-energy plant in nearby Bridgeport, an
extremely expensive prospect.
   Fairfield paid $3 million to build its recycling plant,
including about $750,000 that went to International Process Systems
for the plans.
   Residents were at first wary of the company's claim of odorless
composting. Other composting plants, like one in Lancaster County,
Pa., have come under fire for the odor problem.
   ``People always associate garbage dumps with smell,'' First
Selectman Jacquelyn C. Durrell said. ``There were concerns because
it was new and was never tried before.''
   But once the plant started operation and there was no telltale
odor marking the plant's location, local officials knew they had
made the right decision.
   ``I knew we were on the right track when, months after the plant
was running, someone asked me if we had the plant started,''
Durrell said.

   The Canton, N.C., fire chief - Phillip Smathers - shipped out
with the reserves and took along the city building inspector:
Phillip Smathers.
   Big Stone Gap, Va., lost its local police sergeant, two members
of its volunteer rescue squad and four voices from the Lonesome
Pine Community Chorus.
   The chorus, more lonesome than ever, has canceled its annual
Christmas concert.
   Across America, the deployment of troops for Operation Desert
Shield in Saudi Arabia has changed daily life in unexpected ways,
pushing spouses into new roles and removing key players who often
wear more than one important hat in the towns where they live.
   It also has knocked the economic wind from communities heavily
dependent on reservists or on nearby military bases that are
emptying out as Iraq's occupation of Kuwait drags into its fifth
month.
   The central Texas town of Killeen, reeling from the call-up of
20,000 of the 38,500 soldiers from nearby Fort Hood, has become an
economic disaster area.
   ``I feel the mayors of these cities across the country who are
responsible for these people affected should have been briefed on
what to expect,'' Mayor Major Blair said. ``After all, we're the
ones who pay taxes to support this operation. We provide the
infrastructure for these military people. Now that infrastructure
is being shattered.''
   Fourteen businesses have closed, including six car dealers, a
steakhouse and two gas stations, one of which had been in town 25
years, Blair said. Business is down as much as 60 percent for other
merchants, rental occupancy is half its usual level and 1,000 area
homes are vacant.
   The city and local college are documenting the problems and plan
to use them in a plea for assistance to the U.S. Department of
Commerce, Blair said.
   ``They can provide all these funds for acts of God disasters,''
he said, ``and nothing has been addressed with respect to economic
disasters at the hands of the government.''
   Businesses ranging from auto dealers to pizza parlors say sales
are off by 30 percent to 80 percent in St. Robert, Mo., a town of
1,700 near Fort Leonard Wood in south-central Missouri.
   Thomas Moore, assistant manager of a local supermarket, said the
base's 25,300 soldiers, civilians and dependents formed the area's
economic backbone. ``The whole town revolves around the base,'' he
said.
   The same might be said of Hinesville, Ga., where homes sales are
down as much as 30 percent and many rentals stand empty since
14,000 soldiers left nearby Fort Stewart.
   ``I think every business in town is affected,'' realtor Allen
Brown said. ``There are a lot of people concerned.''
   Among them is Howard ``Curley'' Gainous, owner of Curley's
Barber Shop, whose $10,000-a-month business has been devastated by
the loss of thousands of close-cropped military customers.
   ``It's been terrible. The first month it dropped to less than
half. Then it dropped even more,'' he said.
   It's the same story 3,000 miles away, at Charlene's House of
Beauty in Twentynine Palms, Calif., near the Marine Corps Training
Center. Charlene Luongo watched her profits evaporate as thousands
of Marines pulled out of the nation's largest such base, followed
by many of their wives and girlfriends.
   ``The way I understand it, they went home to Mama,'' she said.
``I've lost about 50 percent of my business.''
   Tony Jones has watched business fall off by more than 20 percent
at the laundry and car wash he owns in Hopkinsville, Ky., near Fort
Campbell, which has deployed 17,000 soldiers so far. The sooner
they return, the better.
   ``Yesterday would have been too late,'' Jones said. ``When you
sit here and chart your business ... I think you realize they mean
a lot to us.''
   In some communities, individual departures have meant more than
local residents might have imagined.
   The trial of a man accused of murder and attempted murder in
Grand Forks, N.D., was postponed because his defense attorney was
called to active duty.
   Seven doctors at hospitals in the Pascagoula, Miss., area were
called up last month, leaving three hospitals in the region without
any plastic surgeons.
   The parks and recreation director in Watauga County, N.C.,
shipped out this month. Reidsville, a North Carolina town of about
13,000, lost its only police narcotics officer, Mac Ellison, who
also was a member of the countywide narcotics task force.
   Wewoka, Okla., gave up one officer and one dispatcher to
military service, a blow for a department of 10.
   ``It creates some hardships for us,'' said City Manager Greg
McElroy. ``It's created a shortage we're trying to fill.''
   Walhalla, N.D., said goodbye to 20 of its 1,429 residents,
including mailman Dale Anderson.
   ``There's nothing like having him here,'' Mayor Pat Hardy said.
``We're still getting our mail, but we'd rather have him.''
   In Cando, N.D., Nancy Rader feels the same way about husband
Gary, called up in September. Since then, she's been running their
small durum and grain farm and preparing this month for the birth
of their fourth child.
   At Fort Stewart, Ga., Army wives and girlfriends have been
coaching kids' sports and other women during childbirth, standing
in for absent spouses. Some 700 women are expected to give birth by
March at the base hospital, and many of them will have other women
supporting them.
   Out on the football field, women are calling the plays.
   ``We've got some boys who at first thought, `These women don't
know anything about football,' '' said Charlotte Clabough, whose
husband, James, is in Saudi Arabia. ``I feel we've won their
confidence.''

<HEAD>Desert Shield Won't Stop Defense Spending Slide</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Gulf-Local Economy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Operation Desert Shield won't protect the
nation's weapons makers from lean times or save thousands of
workers from layoff, military experts said.
   Give or take a tank here and a missile system there, defense
contractors say they are sticking by their gloomy forecasts. And
lawmakers still talk about legislation to help communities hardest
hit by defense budget cuts.
   Even with a war, the outlook does not necessarily improve for
arms contractors.
   ``To the extent that this conflict creates the outlook for peace
in the Middle East, it worsens the prospects for major defense
contractors,'' said Thomas Lloyd-Butler, an analyst who watches
defense contractors for Montgomery Securities in San Francisco.
   The most immediate financial beneficiaries of the deployment of
U.S. troops to the Persian Gulf are small manufacturers of
uniforms, personal items, protective gear and food. The Pentagon is
spending billions on shiploads of sun screen, cold drink mix,
desert-camouflaged clothing, prepared meals and bottled water.
   But there's been no comparable surge in orders for weapons
manufacturers. The predictions of lean times that preceded the Aug.
2 invasion of Kuwait by Iraqi forces remain unshaken.
   ``We're looking over the next five years at a declining defense
budget, there's no doubt about that,'' said Pete Schmidt, an
analyst with the Defense Budget Project, a Washington-based think
tank. ``What Desert Shield has done is affect the slope of the
decline. It's not going to be as steep. It's not shrinking as
fast.''
   There have been some exceptions. The Land Systems Division of
General Dynamics - which encompasses plants in Michigan, Ohio and
Connecticut - gained a windfall in the sale of some 700 tanks to
Saudi Arabia.
   Raytheon Co. of Lexington, Mass., has already sold the Saudi's
$1.1 billion in antiaircraft missile systems and will likely sell
more.
   Though there haven't been any new orders for C-17 transport
planes, they were in short supply during the airlift to Saudi
Arabia and the Pentagon may be considering another order. The
planes are made by McDonnell Douglas Corp. with engines from Pratt
&amp; Whitney.
   Pratt and the other major jet engine maker, General Electric
Corp., may also benefit from new orders and maintenance contracts
for plane and helicopter engines. The desert heat and sand lead to
frequent engine overhauls and replacements.
   ``There's no doubt this isn't detrimental,'' Schmidt said.
``They're smiling. They're smiling all the way to the bank.''
   Rey Aponte of the Army Materiel Command said that while there's
been no rush of new orders for weapons, that's being considered in
higher echelons of the Pentagon.
   But unless a war breaks out, bringing on the wholesale
destruction of weapons and the need for new equipment - and maybe
not even then - ``all you've done is slightly postpone how
precipitous the decline will be in the defense budget,'' said Ron
Hertenstein, research vice president at Forecast International, a
Connecticut-based consulting firm.
   A war could actually hurt military contractors who are primarily
involved in future-oriented research and development projects.
   ``In a shooting battle you produce more of what you've got on
line ready to go,'' said Schmidt, the analyst with the Defense
Budget Project. ``Your modernization gets put on hold.''
   The Defense Budget Project recently looked into the question of
which contractors might be hurt by a Persian Gulf War. Contractors
involved in the B-2 bomber project and the Advanced Tactical
Fighter, particularly Northrop Corp., might lose heavily if a war
cut into funding for the costly aircraft.
   The costs and requirements of war might, under Schmidt's
analysis, require a reversal of the defense spending strategy
outlined earlier this year by Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the
Senate Armed Services Committee. Nunn said the Pentagon should
modernize weapons within a lean budget.
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., the ranking Republican on the Senate
Armed Services Committee and a former secretary of the Navy, said
the sudden cost increases of Desert Shield may be offset by
contributions from foreign countries and by the decline of the cost
of manning the NATO front in Europe.
   The most likely beneficiaries of Desert Shield among weapons
makers, Warner said, will be those who make ammunition and
missiles, like Martin Marietta Corp. and Raytheon.
   One after another, spokesmen for the major defense contractors
said they're not profiting from Desert Shield.
   Bob O'Brien, McDonnell Douglas: ``I don't think any hardware
manufacturer has a surge in orders ... You can't just spit these
things out.''
   Alvin Spivak, General Dynamics: ``There hasn't been any
immediate significant increase in sales of our products as a result
of the Mideast situation.''
   George Jamison, GE: ``There's been no significant impact.''
   One official for a military contractor who asked to remain
anonymous said the company's board is predicting further reductions
in defense spending when the president proposes a budget in
January.
   ``If anything, it's looking worse,'' the official said. ``The
Pentagon, as far as we know, is in for more severe cuts.''

<TEXT>
   The next presidential campaign will likely
feature a fiery debate over affirmative action. But one party will
call it simple justice, the other will label it unfair quotas and
voters will have to decide whom to believe.
   Sen. Jesse Helms rode to re-election in North Carolina after
accusing his black challenger, Democrat Harvey Gantt, of supporting
racial quotas. And while some denounced the tactic, others detected
a way to bolster the identity and electoral strength of the
Republican Party.
   ``Helms came from 13 points behind to win comfortably, I think
solely on this issue,'' said GOP consultant Roger Stone. ``It is
the kind of cutting social issue that conservatives need to hold
onto the White House.''
   A number of recent developments suggest voters may be hearing a
lot more about affirmative action and racial quotas between now and
November 1992:
   -Democratic congressional leaders have renewed their pledge to
once again pass a civil rights bill that President Bush branded a
quota bill and vetoed in the last Congress.
   -Virginia Gov. Doug Wilder, the only Democrat blatantly testing
the 1992 presidential waters, blasted Bush's characterization of
the bill and said it gave Helms phony ammunition. ``I know what
racial quotas are; I have experienced them firsthand,'' Wilder, who
is black, said in a letter to Bush.
   -William Bennett, the new Republican Party chairman, defended
Helms' use of the quota issue and said he was ready to debate
affirmative action if the Democrats bring it up. ``Most Americans
are troubled'' by racial preference programs, he said.
   -Rep. Richard Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, chided
Bennett for his remarks in a speech last week and charged that
``ideologues on the right are following a new trail of racial
resentment and recrimination'' blazed by Louisiana state legislator
David Duke.
   -Disaffected Democrats at a conservative forum predicted doom
for their party unless more moderate voices are heard. ``Until we
give up fear and discuss these issues rationally and logically, we
are going to continue to lose,'' said former New York Mayor Ed
Koch.
   Prominent Democrats say their party has a sound position but
others have distorted it.
   ``I don't know what there is to redefine,'' said party chairman
Ron Brown, who is black. ``The Democratic Party and its chairman in
particular vehemently oppose quotas. We vehemently oppose anything
that could lead to reverse discrimination. The legislation that the
Democratic Congress sent forward to the president was not a quota
bill. It was supported by a number of conservative Republicans.''
   But the Democrats - including Gantt himself - acknowledge that
they haven't communicated well with voters, many of whom equate
affirmative action with quotas. As Stone noted, ``Harvey Gantt ran
up and down North Carolina saying he wasn't for quotas, but nobody
believed him.''
   Working against the Democrats is a feeling among some voters
that the civil rights agenda of the 1960s has been fulfilled - that
affirmative action was supposed to be temporary and small-scale and
has outlived its time.
   But Gantt said hundreds of years of discrimination cannot be
remedied in two decades. ``That's not even one generation,'' he
said. ``We need to do it, and we need to remove the stigma that
we're going to discriminate against whites or we're going to
promote blacks who aren't qualified. None of that is true.''
   Many Democrats maintain the heart of the matter is economics.
They say Republicans want to divert attention from the recession,
and the whole idea of affirmative action is more threatening now
because jobs are scarce.
   ``This issue is about a shrinking economic pie and people
thinking someone's going to give their slice to somebody else,''
said Democratic strategist Mike McCurry.
   ``You have to recast the debate to show the Republicans are
trying to peddle fear instead of a plan to get the economy going.
And you have to have an answer for the working person who fears for
his job,'' he added. ``You have to say, `my plan is to develop a
red-hot economy so we all have jobs.'''
   Republican analyst Doug Bailey thinks his party, too, should
look at the big picture. He said it would be ``a big political
mistake'' to lean heavily on affirmative action to fill the void
left by the end of the Cold War and the splintering of the GOP on
abortion and taxes.
   ``It turns off a large corps of moderate voters, Northern
suburban voters who have supported the Republican party in the
past,'' Bailey said. ``They will not want to see a party
intentionally choose an issue, even though it may have some merit,
which divides people on racial lines.''
   However, Stone said the theme would appeal to a group that is
equally if not more important to the party - blue-collar ``Reagan
Democrats.'' And he maintained it could be pursued without the GOP
appearing to be insensitive or divisive.
   ``You can use other issues to illustrate your desire for
economic growth in the minority community,'' Stone said. ``Go out
and campaign against quotas but for enterprise zones and greater
financial assistance for minority education.''
   But the Democrats firmly believe they hold the higher ground on
civil rights and can persuade voters of that. Foreshadowing the
rhetoric to come, Wilder has accused Bush of failing to provide
moral leadership and Brown called his veto of the civil rights bill
a disgrace.
   ``He had an important choice to make,'' the party chairman said,
``and he chose the politics of Jesse Helms and David Duke rather
than the politics of Martin Luther King and Abraham Lincoln.''

<HEAD>Gold Left Out in the Cold</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Has the gold market given up the ghost?
   That question is debated with increased intensity these days by
analysts who have watched the price of gold barely budge through
all the financial and political tumult since Iraq invaded Kuwait on
Aug. 2.
   To some observers, this behavior is a sign that gold has
suffered some permanent loss of luster as a haven from the ravages
of economic and political upheaval.
   ``This is the first time in 30 years that gold has not bounced
materially in value in the face of a confluence of difficult world
problems,'' say analysts Clarence Morrison and Timothy Alch in a
new report for Prudential-Bache Securities in New York.
   ``Although this may be a temporary situation, we need to rethink
gold's historic role for the future.''
   A hard core of loyalists maintains that all the obituaries are
unwarranted, or at least premature.
   They say gold retains its time-honored status as a store of
value - in effect, an international promise to pay that can't be
broken by politicians or anybody else with the power to devalue
currencies or default on debt.
   ``It constitutes a unique hedge against the world monetary
establishment,'' says James Grant in the current edition of his
newsletter Grant's Interest Rate Observer.
   But even the ``gold bugs'' generally concede that the evidence
on the market charts of late has been running against them.
   While the price of oil has surged this year, for instance, gold
has remained stuck between $350 an ounce and $400 an ounce,
hovering lately in the middle of that narrow range.
   That is less than half the peak of about $875 it reached in
early 1980, the last time soaring oil prices set off a worldwide
economic scare.
   One bank analyst helped to heat up the debate recently by
proposing ``a decent burial for gold.'' He and others argue, in
part, that sophisticated modern investment products and strategies
allow investors more appealing ways to seek a combination of safety
and a return on their money.
   They focus on a drawback long cited by gold's detractors: its
inability to produce any current income in the form of dividends or
interest.
   In fact, the effective ``yield'' on direct investments in gold
is often negative, when costs of such things as storage, security
and sales taxes are taken into account.
   That consideration is especially important these days, analysts
say, because currentlevels of interest rates produce generous
``real'' returns above the inflation rate.
   A decade ago, when gold was hot, nominal interest rates ran well
into double digits, but they were close to zero after subtracting
for inflation.
   Furthermore, points out the Value Line Investment Survey, ``in
contrast to 10 years ago, most world debt is floating rate rather
than fixed rate. This means that interest rates will adjust quickly
to changes in the rate of inflation, reducing the value of gold as
a hedge.''
   Maybe so, says Grant, but trust in paper investments based on
credit may well be tested further in the future.
   His closing argument: ``When the world decides to renounce its
search for the highest available interest rate, and to search
instead for the lowest available risk, it may remember gold.''

   Although the stock market has staged a spirited
rally in the waning weeks of 1990, a sizeable contingent of bears
on Wall Street isn't buying it.
   They say stocks are still no bargain by historical standards,
and face some formidable obstacles from a recession that may have
just barely begun in the U.S. economy.
   ``We continue to believe there is above-average risk in the
stock market,'' says Robert Nurock, a Paoli, Pa., investment
adviser. ``The economic, monetary and technical outlooks all remain
sufficiently negative to warrant a cautious investment stance.''
   Analysts readily acknowledge that it isn't unusual to see stocks
turning upward before there is any discernible evidence of a slump
in business conditions.
   But the doubters question how long buyers can keep celebrating a
drop in interest rates and shrugging off evidence of weakening
conditions for growth and profitability.
   ``Until prospects for the economy and corporate profits improve,
stock prices appear vulnerable to recurring bouts of selling
pressure,'' maintain analysts at Wright Investors' Service, a
Bridgeport, Conn., investment management firm.
   Wright notes that the stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average
have lately been selling at an aggregate ratio of 1.9 times their
book value, or theoretical worth should their operations be
liquidated and the proceeds distributed to shareowners.
   Over the past 40 years, the firm says, the market has generally
fluctuated between one and two times book value, with an average
multiple of about 1.5. During the last seven recessions it bottomed
out at an average level of 1.1.
   ``Whether or not current price-value multiples represent an
accurate appraisal of the market's long-term growth potential, they
appear to be excessive for the recessionary environment of
1990-91,'' Wright concludes.
   Heiko Thieme at Deutsche Bank Capital Corp. in New York, who
argues that stock prices probably bottomed out several weeks ago,
nevertheless concedes that false-start upswings are common in the
midst of declining markets.
   ``The primary downward trend in a bear market is often abruptly
broken by quick moves to the upside, fueled by premature
optimism,'' Thieme says.
   Whether false or true, the market's latest advance continued in
the past week. The Dow Jones average closed Friday at 2,590.10, up
30.45 from the week before.
   Since it closed at an 18-month low of 2,365.10 on Oct. 11, the
averaage has risen 225 points, or 9.5 percent.
   Other readings for the week showed the NYSE's composite index of
all its listed common stocks up 3.01 at 179.07; the American Stock
Exchange market value index up 4.66 at 306.45, and the NASDAQ
composite index for the over-the-counter market up 12.48 at 371.54.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 200 million shares a day,
against 151.58 million the wek before.
   Nurock says an important force behind the bull market of the
1980s - a steady shrinkage in the amount of stock available for
trading - seems to have spent itself as the '90s begin.
   Much of that reduction stemmed from corporate restructurings and
takeovers in which debt was used to replace stock in the base of
capital used by many businesses.
   Now the takeover boom has faded and debt is unfashionable, to
say the least.
   In fact, Nurock suggests, the supply of stock may actually start
to swell with a shift back from debt to equity capital.
   ``Corporations need to reliquefy their balance sheets after
taking on so much debt during the last economic cycle,'' he says.
   ``With interest expenses growing for many businesses, and the
ability to service indebtedness diminishing, the sale of new stock
will become an important priority in raising new capital.''

<HEAD>Retailers Confirm Christmas Season Is Off to a Poor Start</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Retail Sales-Table</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The Christmas spirit took a back seat to consumer concerns about
the economy and the Middle East in November, resulting in another
disappointing month for many of the nation's biggest retailers.
   Several stores said Thursday their sales fell from November 1989
levels, including Sears, Roebuck and Co.; J.C. Penney Co. Inc. and
May Department Stores Co.
   Analysts were pessimistic about the chances for retailers to
turn the Christmas season around.
   ``Unless a very quick solution to the Mideast were to occur,
consumer confidence will remain extremely weak,'' said Jeffrey
Feiner, an analyst with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
   Consumers sharply curtailed their holiday spending even during
the Thanksgiving weekend, traditionally one of the most popular
shopping periods in the year.
   Retailers are expecting most of their holiday business to come
during the last 10 days before Christmas.
   But Jeffrey Edelman, an analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd
Inc., predicted that after adjusting for inflation, the retail
industry will see its overall sales drop 1 percent to 2 percent for
the holiday season. Some individual retailers are likely to suffer
even sharper declines.
   ``That's what a recession's all about,'' he said.
   Consumer spending on non-essentials such as clothing, furniture
and appliances has fallen sharply since the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait sent gasoline and heating oil prices higher, leaving
Americans with less money to spend.
   Many shoppers have said they will spend less on gifts this
Christmas because they don't have as much extra money as they did
last year. Consumer caution was evident last month not only in how
much shoppers were spending, but in what consumers were buying and
where they shopped.
   Department stores and general merchandise retailers like Sears
bore the brunt of November's dismal results, but discount stores
fared somewhat better.
   Kenneth Macke, the chairman of Dayton Hudson Corp., said in an
interview this week that some of the most popular items this season
were practical rather than trendy - flannel shirts and clothing
made of fleece.
   A poor Christmas could lead to severe financial problems for
somecompanies. One already struggling is Child World Inc., the
nation's second-largest toy store chain, which has suspended
payment on some of its bills because it is short of cash.
   Child World, which reports its sales quarterly, has said it will
cut prices at its 182 stores. That could put pressure on its
competitors to also mark merchandise down.
   Many stores have been cutting inventories in hopes of avoiding
markdowns. Retailers also continue to trim expenses in hopes of
preserving their profits. Sears announced this week it is freezing
salaries for 20,000 of its managers as part of its cost-cutting
program.
   Sears, the nation's largest retailer, said November sales at
stores open at least a year fell 2.4 percent, while the company's
overall sales dropped 1.6 percent.
   Analysts believe sales from stores open at least a year - also
known as same-store or comparable store sales - provide a more
accurate assessment of a retailer's performance than overall sales.
New stores tend to have extraordinarily strong sales that can skew
a retailer's results.
   Penney said same-store sales dropped 4.6 percent, while overall
sales slipped 3.1 percent.
   May suffered a 5 percent drop in same-store sales as its overall
sales fell 0.2 percent.
   Even Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which consistently outperforms the
rest of the industry, saw sales lag. Wal-Mart reported its
same-store sales were up 7 percent, below the discount retailer's
usual double-digit increase, while overall sales were up 22
percent.
   Wal-Mart reached a milestone in November, passing Kmart Corp. to
become the nation's second-largest retailer. Wal-Mart chalked up
$25.46 billion in year-to-date sales through November, while Kmart
recorded nearly $25.2 billion.
   For the month of November, Kmart said same-store sales fell 1.5
percent, while overall sales rose 5.1 percent.
   The results differ from the monthly retail sales report from the
government, which includes sales from supermarkets, restaurants and
car dealers.
   In other retailers reports:
   -Limited Inc., the nation's largest specialty apparel retailer,
said its same-store sales rose 4 percent, while overall sales
jumped 24 percent.
   -Dayton Hudson reported a 3.4 percent gain in same-store sales,
and a 15.1 percent rise overall. A poor showing at Dayton Hudson's
department stores was offset by its Target discount stores and
Mervyn's moderate-priced apparel chain.
   -Woolworth Corp. said same-store sales picked up 1.3 percent,
while overall sales rose 4.9 percent.

   Here are the domestic November sales and sales for the year to
date reported Thursday by some of the nation's largest retailers.
   Many of the major companies have agreed to issue their monthly
results on the same date, similar to the practice in past years.
Monthly results had been released on different days earlier this
year.
   Some top retailers do not report their sales on a monthly basis,
including R.H. Macy &amp; Co. And, Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., a privately
held retailer, has discontinued releasing its monthly sales.
Reporting periods vary slightly and not all retailers have the same
fiscal year.
   For some retailers, fiscal 1990 contains 53 weeks and their
results have been restated to reflect the change in the calendar
from fiscal 1989. Dayton Hudson Corp.'s overall results have not
been restated.

<HEAD>Oil Producing Nations Expected to Reject Production Ceiling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NEIL MacFARQUHAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   OPEC is expected to reject attempts
to cap production when the cartel meets next week, reaffirming an
agreement to let oil flow while the Middle East crisis persists.
   Gulf sources said members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries are producing about 23 million barrels per day,
500,000 barrels over the ceiling agreed to in late July just days
before Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   Prices have fluctuated between $25 and $40 per barrel on rumors
of war, well above the target price of $18 per barrel. Despite the
increase, OPEC is expected to rebuff any calls to reduce
production.
   At an emergency session in August, the 13 OPEC nations agreed to
ignore the ceilings and quotas to make up for the 4 million barrel
per day loss of Kuwait and Iraqi oil due to a United Nations
embargo.
   Sources said the agreement will hold when representatives of the
13 OPEC nations open a formal meeting Wednesday in Geneva.
Ministers are to begin gathering Monday for informal discussions.
   ``It is meaningless and harming OPEC and all its members to say
oil is selling at higher than the stated price and we have to
decrease production,'' a Saudi source said, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   Saudi Arabia alone has pushed production up by about 60 percent,
from 5.38 million barrels daily just before the invasion to 8.3
million barrels per day.
   Both Iraq and Iran will push for decreased production, a Gulf
source said. Damage from the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war means Iran
cannot increase production beyond its 2.64 million barrels a day
quotaand it is eager for high prices to help rebuild its
production.
   In addition, Iran has a backlog of about 40 million barrels of
unsold heavy crude in Europe, the gulf source said.
   Iraq is expected to accuse Saudi Arabia of kowtowing to American
interests at the OPEC gathering.
   ``They will make some noise but nobody is going to listen to
them,'' the Saudi source said. ``The meeting will most likely
reaffirm the August agreement that there is no quota, no ceiling
until the crisis is over.''
   OPEC members are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.
   Iran also may push the organization to discuss cooperating with
consumer nations on investing in increased production, the sources
said. Saudi Arabia is likely to support the idea but argue it
should be done through bilateral agreements.
   Saudi Arabia also is expected to reaffirm its commitment to a
stable market, even in the event of fighting. Earlier this week,
Saudi officials told U.S. Secretary of Energy James Watkins the
country might lose up to 2 million barrels of oil daily if fighting
breaks out as workers flee its northeastern fields near Iraq,
industry sources said.
   Iraq is not expected to be able to damage the fields, but lack
of personnel could force some fields to close, the sources said.
Fighting alone, much less a shutdown, would likely send oil prices
to unparalled heights due to market panic.
   Watkins told the Saudis the United States would be willing to
draw down its 600-million-barrel strategic petroleum reserves to
make up any shortfall during a war, the sources said.
   There is some question as to who will represent Iraq at the
meeting. Acting oil minister Hussein Kamal, a close relative of
Saddam Hussein, is unlikely to attend.
   A possible representative is assistant oil minister Sami Sherif
Al-Takriti, who is from Saddam's native village. He was installed
last year when Kamal, who also is minister of industry and military
industrialization, wrested the refining industry into his domain,
the Gulf source said.

<HEAD>Government Estimates Milken's Crimes Worth at Least $4.7 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers for the government and Michael Milken
are disputing the dollar amount that should be attached to the
financial felon's admitted crimes. The two sides are more that $4
million apart.
   The number is important because an estimate of the total fraud
involved in Milken's crimes will help determine when he will become
eligible for parole.
   Milken, 44, was sentenced last month to 10 years in prison and
three years' probation for his guilty plea to six felony counts
related to illegal securities trading. He also agreed to pay $600
million in penalties.
   Under federal guidelines, if the losses from Milken's crimes
exceeded $1 million he would get a recommended sentence of 40 to 52
months before qualifying for parole. If the losses totaled $200,000
to $1 million, Milken would face a recommended 24 to 36 months
before parole.
   In letters to U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood on Thursday,
prosecutors said Milken's crimes involved more than $4.7 million in
fraud, while the defense placed the total at $326,000.
   But at a hearing, Wood said she may not include an estimate in
her recommendation to the U.S. Parole Commission. She said she
might instead offer parole officials guidelines to help them set a
figure on their own.
   Parole commission rules are not precise about how to calculate
wrongdoing in complex securities trading cases such as Milken's.
The government said the commission should consider the illegal
economic benefit to Milken and the consequences of his illegal
relationships to the financial markets.
   Nonetheless, both sides offered their own version of Milken's
admitted fraud.
   Assistant U.S. Attorneys John Carroll and Jess Fardella said
that while it is difficult to calculate Milken's financial
wrongdoing, his illegal dealings in seven transactions included in
the guilty plea can be valued at a minimum of $4.7 million.
   The figure includes a $3 million financing fee paid to Drexel in
connection with an illegal arrangement with admitted inside trader
Ivan Boesky on trading in Fishbach Corp. securities. But Wood last
week said the amount should not be included in the parole
recommendation.
   On other transactions, prosecutors included $113,000 in
commission income paid to Drexel related to stock manipulation of
MCA Inc., plus an undetermined amount for the actual manipulation.
The defense put the figure at $26,250.
   The government calculated damages of $862 million from
fraudulent payments in an ilegal arrangement with money manager
David Solomon. The defense said the total cannot exceed $300,000.
   Prosecutors claimed the government was defrauded of $483,000 in
taxes evaded by Solomon with Milken's help through bogus trades in
1985. The defense said the figure is only $367,500. But it also
claimed Drexel paid the taxes that Solomon didn't, so the
government lost no money.
   Finally, prosecutors said Milken was to split at least $500,000
in unrealized gains with Boesky for trading in Harris Graphics
securities. The defense said there is no evidence Milken ever
received any gain or the money was the result of an illegality.
   The defense calculation amounted to $326,250 if the Solomon tax
loss is discounted, and $693,000 if it is not.
   The discrepancies relate primarily to legal disputes over
precisely what wrongdoing should be included in the calculations.
Milken admitted to conspiracy, securities and mail fraud, helping
Solomon file false income taxes and violating Securities and
Exchange Commission regulations.
   Milken is to report to federal custody on March 4. No prison has
yet been designated.

   While the Federal Reserve didn't support the
dollar during its precipitous August-to-September decline,
officials at the nation's central bank say they remain concerned
about the drop in the U.S. currency.
   The Fed said Thursday it took no action to support the dollar in
the latest three-month period, when the U.S. currency touched new
lows in foreign exchange trading. It was the second straight period
the Fed didn't intervene.
   But Sam Y. Cross, an executive vice president at the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York, said the decision not to step in
``certainly should not be regarded as any indication the United
States is out of the intervention business.''
   The Fed has the authority to buy and sell dollars to influence
the currency's direction.
   The quarterly foreign-exchange report by the New York Fed showed
the dollar declined 4 percent to 4.5 percent against the major
European currencies in the period ended Oct. 31.
   Specifically, the dollar touched record lows against the German
mark and Swiss franc and fell nearly 11 percent against the
Japanese yen.
   The period was marked by a barrage of market-moving economic and
political events, most notably the eruption of the Persian Gulf
crisis, which had both a positive and negative effect on the
dollar.
   On one hand, the dollar benefited from the perception it's a
safe-haven currency in times of world turmoil. Indeed, the dollar
reached a peak during the period on Aug. 2, when Iraq invaded
Kuwait, reaching 1.6215 German marks and 151.60 Japanese yen.
   But the Fed report said the dollar was later ``undermined by
concerns that the U.S. economy was more vulnerable than other major
economies to the steep rise in oil prices caused by the conflict.''
   In addition, the dollar also was hurt by continued concern over
the health of the U.S. economy and rising interest rates overseas.
The Fed noted that hikes in Japanese and German interest rates - as
U.S. rates declined - eliminated the dollar's interest-rate
advantage.
   The dollar currently is trading at about 1.4885 German marks and
132.15 Japanese yen.
   The dollar steadied in September, when finance ministers from
the Group of Seven industrialized nations met in Washington and
issued a statement saying exchange rates were ``broadly in line.''
   There were rumors that the Fed had intervened during the period,
but that was not the case. Still, Cross said ``it should not be
taken as an indication U.S. authorities are indifferent to
movements in the dollar or are welcoming dollar declines. To the
contrary, U.S. authorities are on record in a number of recent
statesments indicating their concern over the dollar declines.''
   He pointed to recent testimony by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan,
who said a weaker dollar is cause for concern despite the fact that
a lower dollar makes U.S. exports more competitive abroad.
   One ``cannot conclude that the United States is prepared to
see'' the dollar weaken, Cross said. The dollar ``is in a range
where we have to be very watchful and concerned.''
   But the Fed does not intervene solely because of market
mechanics. Cross said the decision to step in is based on a number
of factors, including ``the condition in the foreign exchange
market and other financial markets, the size and speed of movements
in foreign exchange rates, the assessment of market attitues and
sentiment and (anticipation of) the reaction to'' any Fed move as
well as the broad economic and politcal climate.
   The last time the Fed chose not intervene for two back-to-back
periods was in late 1986.

<TEXT>
   Former Hooker Corp. chairman George
Herscu was sentenced Friday to five years in prison after being
convicted of corruption charges involving a state politician.
   Herscu, once one of Australia's 10 richest men but now bankrupt,
showed no emotion when Brisbane District Court Judge Pat Shanahan
imposed a sentence that was two years less than the maximum.
   The 62-year-old Romania native was found guilty Thursday of
paying $77,000 in 1983 to a cabinet minister to influence Brisbane
officials to ease pedestrian and vehicle access restrictions to a
failing shopping center.
   Shanahan told Herscu the money must be the most unwise
investment he ever made, saying it led Herscu to court, to prison
and to disgrace. The judge made no recommendation as to early
parole.
   Earlier, the developer wept in court as several character
witnesses, many of them longtime friends, testified on his behalf.
   Herscu had pleaded not guilty to two charges of official
corruption. He claimed he made the two $38,500 payments to
Queensland Cabinet minister Russ Hinze, who at the time was the
state minister for main roads and local government, to buy him two
racehorses.
   But the Brisbane District Court jury found him guilty after a
four-week trial.
   A Romanian Jew, Herscu worked in Nazi labor camps during World
War II until being liberated by the Soviet Army in 1944. He moved
to Australia in 1950.
   As a 25-year-old in 1953, Herscu bought one small grocery store
then others, including one at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics. In 1959,
he went into property development.
   The beginning of the end came in 1986 when Herscu took over
Hooker Corp., Australia's premier property developer with
substantial U.S. interests.
   Herscu took out loans and spent $1 billion, in part on up-market
American retailers, including Bonwit Teller.
   After being steered into shopping-center developments in the
United States, Hooker grounded on a $1.5 billion debt in July 1989.
Both Hooker and Herscu's personal company, Hersfield Developments
Corp., went into liquidation.
   In July, Herscu and his wife, Sheila, declared themselves
bankrupt. The move came two days before a bankruptcy claim made
against them was to be heard in a Melbourne Court.

<HEAD>Bankrupt Continental Unveils Service to Frankfurt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Continental Airlines, which filed for
bankruptcy protection this week, plans to begin daily non-stop
service to Frankfurt from Newark International Airport on June 1.
   The announcement Thursday came just three days after the
nation's fifth-largest carrier sought protection from its creditors
under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
   At a news conference at the airport, Continental executive vice
president John Nelson said the airline received approval for
landing slots in Frankfurt about two weeks ago. The announcement
was delayed, he said, until Continental made arrangements to lease
a plane to service the route.
   ``Frankfurt has emerged as one of the key business centers of
Western Europe,'' Nelson said in a release, ``and we anticipate
continued growth as the European Economic Community reaches its
1992 unification.''
   The new route requires U.S. Department of Transportation
approval, but Nelson said it would be ``virtually automatic'' and
come within the next few weeks. Frankfurt would become the
airline's 54th international destination.
   Continental has been saying since Monday's bankruptcy filing
that its operations will not be affected by the financial
reorganization. The airline was forced into bankruptcy court by
soaring fuel costs and mounting interest payments on its $6.2
billion debt.
   Nelson said performance has not suffered as a result of the
filing. He said traffic flow and cancellations were running at
normal rates, though he acknowledged that the airline's bookings
have been soft.
   The airline released Department of Transportation figures
showing that Continental had the fifth best on-time performance
among major airlines in October and the third lowest rate of
mishandled baggage.
   ``I've been amazed,'' he said. ``Our airline is running
beautifully.''
   Continental is Newark airport's largest carrier, and more than
one-sixth of the airline's work force of 37,000 are employed in New
Jersey. Newark is Continental's second-largest hub after Houston.
   New Jersey Gov. Jim Florio said he was concened for the 6,000
workers at the Newark airport and planned to meet with Continental
President Hollis Harris and Richard Leone, chairman of the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey, to discuss how the state and
the agency can help the airline. The Port Authority runs Newark,
LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy International airports.

<HEAD>NCR Keeps Up Verbal Battle With AT&amp;T, But Offers No Alternative</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AT&amp;T unveiled its financing plans for a hostile
$6.1 billion takeover offer of NCR Corp., but the computer maker
continued its verbal battle against the telephone giant's bid.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. said Thursday that Chemical
Bank would lead a group of financial institutions that would
provide a $6 billion line of credit for the takeover. The credit
line also would back up short-term notes that the phone company
plans to sell to investors to help fund the takeover.
   AT&amp;T also said it plans to fund the takeover in part with some
of its cash on hand, which totals more than $800 million.
   Speaking at a computer industry symposium in Atlanta, NCR
Chairman Charles E. Exley Jr. made a passing reference Thursday to
the $90-a-share takeover attempt, saying that in the past few days
he has learned more about mergers and acquisitions than he ever
wanted to know.
   ``But nothing will deter us from pursuing our vision of a new
era for computing,'' Exley said, referring to NCR's plans,
announced in September, to replace its entire product line with
industry-standard machines that use the same microprocessor.
   Exley jokingly suggested that American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
would be launching a new advertisting campaign with the slogan
``Reach Out and Grab Someone.''
   Exley has said repeatedly the Dayton, Ohio-based company will
fight AT&amp;T's tender offer, which expires Jan. 4. However, NCR has
not disclosed how it will battle the bid.
   Industry analysts say Exley has few options. The most likely is
to find another merger partner that offers more favorable terms
than AT&amp;T, or a partner that takes only a minority stake in NCR but
still block's the phone company's bid.
   AT&amp;T says it wants to buy the nation's fifth-largest computer
company to bolster its lackluster and unprofitable computer
business, which it launched six years ago.
   NCR's board on Wednesday turned down an AT&amp;T bid in which the
phone company would have exchanged $90 worth of its stock for each
NCR share, calling it ``grossly inadequate.''
   Late Wednesday afternoon, AT&amp;T took its offer directly to NCR
shareholders and changed the terms to cash. Including all NCR
stock, both outstanding shares and those provided under stock
warrants, the deal is valued at about $6.1 billion.
   NCR said it would be willing to discuss a merger if AT&amp;T boosted
its price to $125 a share, for a total of about $8.5 billion. But
AT&amp;T called the figure ``outrageous and totally unjustified.''
   Industry analysts generally believe AT&amp;T will end up the victor,
with the selling price somewhat above $90 a share.
   An official of a major institutional owner of NCR stock, who
spoke on condition on anonymity, said he believed many NCR
shareholders would wait a week or so to see how the takeover battle
develops before they would sell their shares to AT&amp;T.
   ``They're looking for a higher offer, or for NCR to do something
to create higher value,'' he said.
   ``The chairman of NCR seems very shareholder-oriented, or has
been in the past, and I think he is one to continue to act that
way,'' he added.
   Several credit-ratings agencies said Thursday they were
reviewing their opinions on AT&amp;T bonds and other debt in light of
the NCR bid. Gray said the move was not unexpected.
   AT&amp;T also said it filed federal lawsuits in Baltimore and
Columbus, Ohio, seeking rulings that federal law concerning such
takeovers will prevail over state laws in the NCR bid. NCR is
incorporated in Maryland.
   Gray described the lawsuits as routine in takeovers. NCR
spokesman Mark Feighery said the company would have no comment on
the suits until it studied them.
   For its part, NCR filed a suit in U.S. District Court in Dayton
seeking a declaratory judgment that its anti-takeover provisions
are valid.

<HEAD>VCR Maker Challenges MCA Buyout on Antitrust Grounds</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An Arizona consumer electronics firm has
filed an antitrust lawsuit to block the merger of MCA Inc. and
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., claiming they are conspiring to
sabotage sales of its videocassette recorders.
   The federal suit, filed in Phoenix, contends Matsushita's $6.6
billion purchase of MCA violates antitrust law.
   Matsushita denied the allegations in a statement that said: ``We
have only had time for a brief review of the material. However,
even on the basis of our brief review it is apparent the suit is
totally without merit.''
   The suit was filed by Go-Video Inc., a Scottsdale, Ariz.,
company which has marketed a videocassette recorder that can record
two TV programs at the same time or play one tape while recording
another.
   Talk that Matsushita needs MCA to stay competitive after
arch-rival Sony Corp. purchased Columbia Pictures Entertainment
Inc. is a smokescreen, said attorney Joseph Alioto.
   Alioto has represented Go-Video in a series of actions
contending Matsushita, Sony and other Asian companies want to shut
out all U.S. consumer electronics makers. He said he'd taken more
than 70 depositions in Japan over a three-month period that support
that allegation.
   ``We know that if you control the software, you cnntrol the
hardware. ... Except for Go-Video, they already have a monopoly in
the hardware. This is to make sure guys like us don't get in,''
Alioto said.
   He said the Japanese companies intend to use their domination of
both sides of the entertainment business to ensure that
``Go-Video's products will not play their software, and anybody
else (outside Japan) who makes HDTV won't either.''
   The primary objective of the Japanese companies is to dominate
the high-definition television market, Alioto said in a telephone
interview from San Francisco.
   Buying MCA gives Matsushita movies, television shows and
recordings to complement its consumer electronics products. By
controlling both, the company assures itself a ready supply of
programming compatible with any technological improvements that
emerge.
   The strategy was much discussed last year when Sony purchased
Columbia Pictures for $3.4 billion. Many analysts believe that
Sony's Beta format for VCRs might have prevailed over Matsushita's
VHS if Sony had owned Columbia when the Beta format first came out.
   Go-Video already is pursuing its conspiracy claim in an earlier
lawsuit against Matsushita and its Panasonic division; Victor Co.
of Japan Ltd. and its JVC Corp. subsidiary; Sanyo Electric Co.
Ltd.; Sony; and NEC Corp.
   Go-Video contends those companies, unable to develop a machine
that can compete with Go-Video's, conspired to block marketing of
it and have formed a cartel to control such products as
conventional VCRs, digital audio-tape recording equipment and
high-definition television.
   Go-Video is seeking more than $1 billion from the companies in
that action, originally filed in 1987. It settled part of the suit
out of court for $2 million. The suit originally named 14 Japanese
and South Korean companies, as well as the Motion Picture
Association of American.

   The chairman of the board of Child World
Inc., which announced this week that it would delay payments to
some of its suppliers because of money problems, has resigned.
   The company is holding discussions with potential buyers and
plans to slash prices on the merchandise in its 182 stores this
weekend to boost sales.
   Child World is an 82 percent owned subsidiary of CNC Holding
Corp., the parent of Cleveland-based Cole National Corp.
   Child World Chairman Dennis H. Barron, who is alo president and
chief executive officer of Cole National, said in a statement he
was leaving both companies to pursue other interests.
   The company said earlier this week it would delay until Jan. 15
paying for merchandise ordered before Wednesday, and would suspend
payments on the principal on $122 million of working capital.
   The toy retailer said it would make interest payments on its
debt and would pay cash for all merchandise ordered between Dec. 5
and Jan. 15.
   Child World reported a third-quarter loss this year of $14.4
million on sales of $185.6 million, compared with a loss of $4.1
million on sales of $157.3 for the third quarter of 1989.

<TEXT>
   Fallen businessman Alan Bond is ready
to resign as a director of Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd. subsidiary to
keep the company from being placed in liquidation, lawyers said
today.
   Separately, Bond appeared today in a Perth court in connection
with a criminal charge filed against him Thursday over his role in
the rescue of failed financial institution Rothwells Ltd.
   Bond was not required to enter a plea. His next court appearance
was set for Jan. 31.
   Bond is a onetime flamboyant businessman best known for
financing the Australia's stunning triumph over the United States
in the 1983 America's Cup whose brewing and mining empire collapsed
in a mountain of $6 billion in debt.
   Bond Corp. included interests in brewing, media, resources and
property. It had a gold mine and telephone company holdings in
Chile, and brewing and other mining interests in the United States.
   The proposal that Bond and two other directors of Bond Corp.
resign was made by attorneys for the directors and J.N. Taylor
Holdings Ltd., a Bond Corp. subsidiary.
   They wanted to stall a court recommendation that a provisonal
liquidator be appointed to the company. A lawyer for shareholders
said the proposal should be rejected. No decision was reached.
   South Australian Supreme Court Justice Bruce Debelle said
Thursday the liquidation order was warranted in response to action
from shareholders seeking to recover $140 million that Bond Corp.
owes to J.N. Taylor.
   Bond Corp. admits it cannot repay the cash and wants J.N. Taylor
to enter into a debt-for-equity swap.
   In his court appearnace, Bond was required to give investigators
24 hours' notice of any intention to travel abroard.
   Bond is charged under the Securities Industry Code with
dishonestly concealing information during attempts in 1987 to
rescue Rothwells, an investment bank.
   He was charged as a result of the investigations of a special
government task force set up to pursue convictions after Rothwells
collapsed in November 1988 with losses of about $200 million.

   Attempts to restructure the world
trading system were suspended today after negotiators failed to end
an impasse between the United States and the European Community
over reductions in farm subsidies.
   Squabbles between the Americans and the Europeans were so
intense that some delegates feared worsening relations between the
United States and the 12-nation community.
   The talks had been aimed at modernizing and expanding free-trade
rules. Reaching an agreement could have doubled world trade from
its current annual $3.8 trillion over the next decade, according to
a U.S. estimate.
   Lowered tariffs could bring cheaper consumer prices on imported
goods. Businesses and Third World farm exporters could benefit from
more openings to foreign markets. Proposed new rules could provide
better protection against patent and copyright theft.
   Some officials held out hope for an eventual accord.
   David Woods, spokesman for the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, or GATT, said the 107-nation group will pursue talks at a
lower level in Geneva.
   The announcement was madeafter four days of unsuccessful
efforts to overcome a dispute between the United States and the
European Community over farm supports.
   U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said success in the
next attempt ``is clearly going to require changes in the European
position on agriculture. Without a significant and substantial
change in that area, we cannot bring this exercise to a
conclusion.''
   EC Agriculture Secretary Ray MacSharry, without naming the
United States, indirectly accused Washington of pushing early in
the weeklong conference for suspension - in effect failure - of the
most ambitious attempt ever to revamp the world trading system.
   ``I think too many people came here hoping to walk away,''
MacSharry said.
   He added that the European Community's position would not
change: ``We have what we believe to be a very concrete proposal on
the table.''
   Indian Commerce Minister Subramaniam Swamy predicted a break of
four to six weeks while an assessment of the situation is made at
GATT headquarters in Geneva.
   ``The entire negotiations have been hijacked by one issue, which
became a bilateral issue,'' Swamy said.
   The talks teetered between elation and despair Thursday as hopes
rose for a compromise proposal before the session ended in a bout
of acrimony.
   The key, as it has been all week, was farm subsidies. The United
States and its trade allies want the European Community to make
deep cuts in its farm supports, as much as 75 percent to 90
percent, while the EC offered 30 percent cuts in one area, seeking
to protect the livelihood of 10 million farmers.
   A compromise by the Swedish chairman of the agriculture talks
proposed 30 percent cuts in all areas.
   The United States accepted the idea but EC members called it a
``monstrous proposal'' and a ``shocking paper,'' said EC
Agriculture Minister Ray MacSharry.
   Australian Trade Minister Neal Blewett, allied with the United
States on the issue, said the EC position turned the session into
``a sort of farce.''
   Delegates discussing trade in services gave up when they heard
the farm talks had ended.
   Germany's economics minister, Helmut Haussmann, said it was
``very menacing'' to hear reports that the trade and economics
dispute was spilling over into foreign relations between the United
States and EC members.
   After talking with U.S. delegates, Haussmann said, there were
``fears that traditionally friendly European relations with the
United States might suffer.''
   Analysts fear that a complete failure of the GATT talks, called
the Uruguay Round after the country where they started in 1986,
could mean a surge of protectionism and the creation of
inward-looking trading blocs.
   The Uruguay Round is the eighth round of talks to update trade
rules since World War II. GATT was founded in 1947.

<HEAD>Saturn Considering Compensation for Shorted Dealers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saturn Corp. officials are considering
compensation for dealers who have received far fewer of the new
cars than originally promised, an official of the General Motors
Corp. subsidiary says.
   A group made up of dealers and Saturn production and marketing
employees met Wednesday at the company's Spring Hill, Tenn.,
factory to discuss the launch of the line of small cars, which
officially went on sale in October.
   Since production of saleable cars began this summer, Saturn's
strict quality control system has resulted in a much slower
production startup than originally planned.
   That, in turn, has resulted in dealers opening with as few as
one or two cars on their showroom floors, and some dealers have
been asked to delay opening their businesses from February to
April.
   ``A lot of information was shared (at the meeting), but there
was no decision made on any of the retailers' funding issues,''
Saturn spokesman Don Habarek said. ``It still remains under
review.''
   ``We left the meeting with a feeling our interests were
protected,'' said Greg Sutliff, a Saturn dealer from Harrisburg,
Pa.
   ``There's no (compensation) offer,'' said Henry Faulkner III of
Philadelphia, one of the Saturn dealers who has delayed opening his
business. ``It's a complex issue. I wouldn't say anything other
than we had a real candid discussion on a variety of issues.''
   Saturn is a $3 billion project by GM to develop a new way to
build cars in the United States, borrowing heavily from Japanese
and European manufacturing methods.
   The Saturn cars are designed to compete with small Japanese
nameplate cars, including the Nissan Sentra, Honda Civic and Toyota
Corolla. Also in that price range are GM's Geo Prizm and the
Chevrolet Cavalier, both marketed by Chevrolet dealers.

<TEXT>
   Fleet-Norstar Financial Group plans to
cut about 500 jobs by the end of the year, an official of the
banking company said today.
   The layoffs will be scattered among Fleet's 1,000 offices in 40
states, but will primarily affect workers in New England and New
York, said bank spokesman Robert W. Lougee Jr.
   The cutbacks ``range from the top to the bottom of the
organization,'' he said. Some workers have already been notified
and the others will receive pink-slips in the next few weeks, he
said.
   Fleet posted a small profit in the third quarter and was in the
black for the first nine months of the year.
   The Providence-based bank-holding company is being hit by the
recession plaguing the Northeast and blamed the slump for most of
the layoffs.
   ``Obviously, since much of the Northeast, if not nationally, is
in a recession at this point, some of them (the layoffs) can be
attributed to that,'' Lougee said.
   Other reductions were part of an ongoing consolidation since
Fleet Financial Group merged with Norstar Bankcorp of Albany, N.Y.,
in 1988.
   Shortly after the merger, Fleet-Norstar employed 19,500 people.
Today, it employs, 18,000, Lougee said.
   ``Some of (the layoffs) would have been done in the best of
economic times,'' he said. ``We have consolidated irrespective of
the economy over the last few years.''
   Fleet's third-quarter earnings plummeted 60.1 percent from the
same period a year ago to $38.5 million, but it was enough to give
the company a $434,000 profit for the first nine months. Fleet
posted a $278.9 million profit for the January-through-September
period in 1989.
   Lougee said he would not guess on Fleet's profitability for the
fourth-quarter.
   The work force reduction was expected to save the company about
$25 million next year before one-time costs such as severance and
outplacement expenses. Fleet plans to eliminate an additional $75
million in overhead expenses, including marketing and advertising
costs, Lougee said.
   He said he did not expect any additional layoffs.

   The formula used to distribute federal health
care money for the needy underpays poor states while favoring
richer ones, the General Accounting Office said today.
   Janet Shikles of the congressional investigative agency told a
House subcommittee that the current formula based on per capita
income often fails to reflect the true level of poverty in a state.
   Shikles also said the formula does not account for the ability
of states to raise revenues from business sources.
   ``The formula does not target most federal funds to states with
the greatest needs ... those with weak tax bases and high
concentrations of poor people,'' she told the Government Operations
subcommittee on human resources and intergovernmental relations.
   The government should shift to a formula using the number of
people in poverty in a state combined with the total availability
of ``taxable resources,'' such as business earnings and dividends
distributed to out-of-state shareholders, she said.
   Per capita income reflects the average of individual incomes.
   The subcommittee is looking into the ability of state
governments to pay the costs of Medicaid, the joint federal-state
program to provide health care to the poor.
   The federal government pays 55 percent of medical expenses,
while states pay the rest. According to the GAO, the combined
expenditures totaled $61 billion in 1989.
   If the federal share had been cut to 40 percent and a revised
formula used, $3.3 billion of the federal share would have been
shifted to the states, the GAO said. That represents a shift of 17
percent of all federal Medicaid payments for the year.
   Nine states each would have received $100 million or more in
additional funds as a result of the shift: Arkansas, California,
Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, New York, Tennessee and
Texas.
   A dozen states, mostly in the Northeast and Midwest, each would
have had payments reduced by more than $100 million. They are
Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
   The GAO first recommended changing the formula in 1983, and
since then Congress has authorized a substitute formula for
allocating mental health and drug treatment grants, said Shikles,
director of health financing and policy issues at the agency.
   The subcommittee has resurrected the issue because of the
soaring costs of health care, combined with the economic downturn
and limited federal dollars.
   About 26 million people are eligible, according to subcommittee
data, but 13 states are being sued by hospitals and nursing homes
that allege Medicaid payment rates are too low to cover the cost of
doing business.
   The GAO said five states - Alaska, Louisiana, New Mexico, Texas
and Wyoming - have high taxable resources that are disguised by the
per capita income figures. In five others - Florida, Maryland, New
Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island - taxable resources are
not as high as the per capita figures would suggest, it said.
   ``The consequence is that the federal share of Medicaid in
states whose financing capacity is overstated by using per capita
income is too low,'' Shikles said.
   The current formula is also misleading because two states with
the same per capita income can have differing poverty rates, she
said.
   Per capita income in Utah and Arkansas is $11,000, but Utah has
a 20 percent poverty rate and Arkansas has a 32 percent, according
to GAO data.

   The stock market was little changed today,
registering a mixed response to gloomy news on employment.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 1.98 to 2,600.49
in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 573 up, 422 down and
499 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 21.88 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Waall Street.
   The Labor Department reported that the civilian unemployment
rate jumped 0.2 percentage point, to 5.9 percent, and that nonfarm
payroll employment took a bigger-than-expected drop of 267,000, in
November.
   Analysts saw the data as strong corroborating evidence that the
economy has slipped into recession.
   The fresh evidence of weakness in business activity sent
interest rates lower in the U.S. government securities market.
   But stock traders greeted it less enthusiastically, given the
questions it raised about the prospective length and depth of the
recession and the outlook for corporate profits.
   Citicorp dropped \ to 14| after Chairman John Reed spoke of
continued high levels of writeoffs in the company's commercial

   Japanese officials today denied accusations by a
senior U.S. Energy Department official that Japan has been hoarding
crude oil in defiance of an agreement among major consuming nations
to draw down stockpiles.
   ``This is a complete misunderstanding,'' a senior government
official said. ``We are not stockpiling.''
   Linda Stuntz, a U.S. Energy Department under secretary for
policy and planning, told reporters in Washington that in the
months following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Japan increased imports
to meet additional demand instead of drawing down stocks.
   She noted that Japan imported 33 percent more oil in October
than it did in July, and said such actions raised doubts about
future cooperative activities among consuming nations in response
to oil supply shocks.
   The United States and other consumer nations have sought to ease
the immediate shock of losing 4.3 million barrels of oil a day as a
result of the Iraqi invasion by minimizing imports. Stockpiling oil
would contradict such efforts and would put upward pressure on oil
prices.
   Officials in Japan's Foreign Ministry and the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry said that instead of increasing
stocks as planned, Japanese oil companies had actually drawn down
stocks.
   Increased imports, however, were needed during cool winter
months to compensate for higher demand for heating fuel.
   ``The amount of oil imported by Japan fluctuates by 20 to 30
percent every month, depending on seasonal factors. Every year it's
exactly the same pattern,'' said the government official, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   Stuntz's charge that Japan was betraying other oil consuming
nations by not drawing down its 142-day emergency supply
disregarded the fact that the United States is the only country
that has tried to rely on existing stocks, officials said.
   ``No other country has drawn from its emergency stock, and
there's no reason why Japan should,'' the government official said.
   ``I can't imagine why she's saying that. It's a complete
mistake,'' he said. ``Since August, our stocks have been kept at a
142-day supply.''
   In fact, the level of the stockpile increased slightly between
June and October, the most recent month for which statistics are
available. But the growth, from a total of 33.7 million kiloliters
to 33.9 million kiloliters, or about one-third of Japan's daily
consumption, isn't considered significant.
   Japan also has increased crude oil imports to a certain extent
to compensate for shortfalls in supplies of refined oil products
due to the loss of Kuwait's refining system, industry sources
noted.
   ``We've brought in more oil, but less product,'' said Naoki
Kuroda, director general of the international trade and industy
ministry's petroleum department.
   Japan imports nearly all the oil it uses, and 70 percent of its
oil imports come from the Middle East.

<TEXT>
   Kroger Co. says it has received so few
responses in a bond-exchange program to reduce its $1.4 billion
bond debt that it will extend the deadline for replies until Dec.
20.
   The program was to have ended on Tuesday.
   The grocery giant offered Nov. 5 to let holders of bonds that
begin paying 15.5 percent annual interest in October 1993 trade
them in for bonds that pay 13 percent immediately.
   Kroger, which owns supermarkets, convenience stores and food
processing plants in 32 states, issued the bonds during a
multibillion restructuring that began in 1988 after two hostile
takeover attempts.
   Kroger said Thursday that bondholders had offered to trade in
less than $150 million in bonds. The company said it had hoped to
exchange $350 million in bonds.
   Bondholders appear to be avoiding the exchange because the
higher-yield bonds have been increasing in value, said Ross
Margolies, an analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton.
   ``Unless the market changes dramatically, I think most people
are happy with the bonds,'' Margolies said.
   Kroger's interest costs for the $350 million in bonds it hoped
to exchange would be $54.2 million at the higher interest rate in
1994. At the lower rate, the company's interest costs would be cut
to $31.2 million.

   Grain and soybean futures opened lower this
morning on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   The market is being pressured by the failure of the talks on
tariffs and trade in Brussels, said Victor Lespinasse, an analyst
with Dean Witter Reynolds in Chicago.
   The talks broke up yesterday after the two sides failed to agree
on the size of European farm subsidies. There are fears a trade war
could result, Lespinasse said.
   The market is also being pressured by a lack of progress in
talks that may result in the United States extending export credits
to the Soviet Union.
   Analysts say news that Brazilian soybean plantings surged this
week will put added pressure on soybean futures. While Egypt's
purchase of 200,000 metric tons of soft white wheat could support
wheat futures.
   In early trading, wheat was unchanged to a { cent lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $2.47 a bushel; corn was a \
cent to 1 cent lower with December at $2.25{ a bushel; oats were a
{ cent to 1 cent lower with December at $1.10} a bushel; soybeans
were 2 cents to 3} cents lower with January at $5.95 a bushel.
   Livestock and pork futures were higher in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Cattle futures were boosted by higher cash prices, and hog
futures were lifted by perceptions the market is oversold.
   Live cattle were .10 cent to .43 cent higher with December at
79.65 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .38 cent
higher with January at 88.60 cents a pound; live hogs were .12 cent
lower to .45 cent higher with December at 49.45 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .35 cent to 1.30 cents higher with
February at 64.15 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled higher and pork futures were mixed in

   Japanese companies were selected Friday for a
contract to build a people-mover system at the new Kansai airport.
The contract had been the focus of U.S. complaints over access to
Japan's construction market.
   Kansai International Airport Co. said it awarded the $37.7
million contract to Niigata Engineering Co. and Sumitomo Corp.
   Under the contract, the two companies will build a system to
carry passengers to faraway gates at the $7 billion airport,
scheduled to open in 1994.
   AEG Westinghouse Transportation Systems, headquartered in
Pittsburgh, had disputed the bidding for the contract, complaining
that U.S. construction firms did not have fair access to the
Japanese market.
   Westinghouse was one of the 13 bidders.
   The airport company announced in July that the contract for an
automated guide-way transport system in the passenger terminal
building also would be awarded to Niigata Engineering and Sumitomo.
   Westinghouse said there were irregularities in the decision to
give Japanese bidders the people-mover contract. The airport
company maintained that the procedure had been fair.
   As part of a long-standing trade dispute, Japan and the United
States reached an agreement in 1988 on procedures to allow American
builders to bid on construction projects in Japan, including the
Kansai airport.
   U.S. officials said later Japan was making significant progress
in allowing American companies to compete for construction
projects.

<TEXT>
   A handful of banks took steps today to cut the
prime rate by a quarter percentage point to 9} percent, marking the
first time the key lending rate has been lowered in nearly a year.
   The biggest institution so far to trim the rate, which is a base
for setting a wide range of loans like mortgages, was First
Fidelity Bancorp, the nation's 20th largest bank and the largest
bank in New Jersey. The lower rate will be effective on Monday.
   Analysts said they expected other major banks to follow. ``It's
virtually certain the banking industry will go to 9} percent,''
probably by early next week, said William Sullivan, director of
money market research at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   The prime rate reflects a bank's cost of borrowing money and is
used in calculating business and consumer loans. Major banks last
cut the rate by 0.5 percent to 10 percent on Jan. 8.
   The cut came on the heels of an extremely weak employment report
by the Labor Department in Washington, which showed a 0.2 percent
increase in the civilian unemployment rate to 5.9 percent and
offered particularly strong evidence that a recession has firmly
taken hold.
   ``The employment report was extremely weak and suggests that the
Federal Reserve will step up the pace of accommodation,'' Sullivan
said. He also said that the report could trigger ``fairly sharp
declines in short-term money market rates, and that translates to
further downward pressure on the prime rate.''
   Economists have been waiting for the Fed to lower interest rates
to stimulate the economy. The Fed took some action today to notch
rates lower by allowing the federal funds rate, the rate banks
charge each other on overnight loans, to drift down by a quarter of
a percentage point to 7\ percent. In addition, the central bank
said it would inject money into the banking system later in the
afternoon to encourage bank to make more funds available.
   Government officials have beseeched the nation's banks in recent
weeks to broaden lending practices rather than continue to tighten
credit and choke off customers in need of funds.
   Southwest Bank of St. Louis, which had carved out a reputation
for taking the lead in cutting rates, was the first to announce it
was lowering prime, effective Monday. Manufacturers &amp; Traders Trust
of Buffalo, a unit of First Empire State Corp., mimicked the move a
few hours later.
   While known as a rate-cutting maverick of sorts, Southwest has
not always been followed. In late 1989, for example, Southwest
stood alone after trimming its prime rate from 10.5 percent to 10
percent. When no other banks followed, Southwest quietly notched
the rate back up three weeks later.
   ``We think our commercial customers are entitled to some
benefits from this recent trend toward lower interest rates,'' Col.
I.A. Long, Southwest's chairman emeritus, said today.

   Fleet-Norstar Financial Group plans to
cut about 500 jobs by the end of the month in an austerity plan
designed to save about $100 million next year, a company official
said Friday.
   The layoffs will be scattered among Fleet's 1,000 offices in 40
states, but will affect primarily workers in New England and New
York, said bank spokesman Robert W. Lougee Jr.
   The firings should save an estimated $25 million next year
before such costs as severance and outplacement services. Fleet
plans to eliminate an additional $75 million in overhead expenses,
including marketing and advertising costs, Lougee said.
   The Providence-based bank holding company pinned most of the
layoffs on the recession plaguing the Northeast.
   Other staff reductions were part of an ongoing consolidation
begun after Fleet Financial Group merged with Norstar Bankcorp of
Albany, N.Y., in 1988.
   Shortly after the merger, Fleet-Norstar employed 19,500 people.
Today, it employs 18,000, Lougee said.
   ``Some of (the layoffs) would have been done in the best of
economic times,'' he said. ``We have consolidated, irrespective of
the economy, over the last few years.''
   Some workers affected by the layoffs have already been notified
and the others will receive notice in the next few weeks, Lougee
said.
   Fleet's third-quarter earnings plummeted 60.1 percent from the
same period a year ago to $38.5 million, while the company eked out
a $434,000 profit for the first nine months. That compares with a
$278.9 million profit for the first nine months of of 1989.
   Lougee would not predict Fleet's profitability for the fourth
quarter.

<HEAD>Samsung Says It Has No Plan to Buy Orion Pictures Corp.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Samsung Group on Friday described
as ``groundless'' a media report that the South Korean conglomerate
had made inquiries to buy Orion Pictures Corp., a U.S. film
company.
   Samsung officials issued a denial when asked to comment on a
report in Thursday's edition of the Los Angeles Times that Samsung
had made inquires about Orion and wanted to buy it.
   Some people might have speculated that the Korean group would
emulate Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. and Sony Corp., two
Japanese Japanese consumer electronics giant who have made deals
with Hollywood studios.
   Matsushita said last week it had agreed to pay $6.13 billion for
MCA Inc., which owns Universal Picture and MCA Records. Last year,
Sony bought Columbia Pictures Entertainmnet Inc. for $5 billion,
including assumed debt.
   In denying the report, Samung officials noted that the group's
trading arm, Samsung Co., has bought some videotape rights from
Orion.
   Investors bid up the stock price of Orion Pictures Corp. on
Thursday in response to the news report that the South Korean
electronics company was interested in a takeover of the Hollywood
movie studio.
   But after rising $2.25 a share on Thursday, Orion was down
$1.62{ a share at $13.62{ by midafternoon Friday on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   Orion's 800-title film library includes ``Amadeus'' and
``Platoon,'' which won Academy awards for Best Picture in 1984 and
1986, as well as the current box-office success, ``Dances With
Wolves.'' TV series such as ``Cagney &amp; Lacey'' also are in the
vaults. Orion, founded in 1978, does not own a studio lot.
   Samsung, based in Seoul, was founded in 1938 as a food export
company. Fortune magazine ranks it the world's 20th largest
industrial company. Samsung sells televisions, VCRs and microwave
ovens in the United States under the brand names of Sears, J.C.
Penney and other stores.

<HEAD>Lack of News On Aid to USSR Depresses Futures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
lower Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade as a lack of news on
U.S. aid to the Soviet Union took its toll on the market.
   The market has been awaiting announcement that the United States
will extend about $1.2 billion in export credits to the Soviet
Union so that nation can buy U.S. farm products. However, nothing
has come of talks between Soviet officials and the U.S. Agriculture
Department.
   Analysts also noted that the market was hurt by the failure of
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks in Brussels.
   The talks broke up Thursday after the two sides failed to agree
on the size of European farm subsidies. There are fears a trade war
could result, said Victor Lespinasse, an analyst with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   Wheat futures showed gains on aggressive buying by commercial
houses and by Egypt's purchase of 200,000 metric tons of soft white
wheat under the export bonus program, said Paul Sylvester, an
analyst with Gerald Inc. in Chicago.
   At the close, wheat was 2\ cents to 6 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $2.53 a bushel; corn was 1\
cents lower to a \ cent higher with December at $2.26 a bushel;
oats were a { cent to 1} cents lower with December at $1.10 a
bushel; soybeans were 1\ cents to 5 cents lower with January at
$5.95{ a bushel.

   The stock market drifted aimlessly today in a
wary response to gloomy news on employment.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 6.94 to 2,595.54
by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers slightly outnumbered losers in nationwide trading of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 752 up, 736 down and 512
unchanged.
   The Labor Department reported that the civilian unemployment
rate jumped 0.2 percentage point, to 5.9 percent, in November, and
that nonfarm payroll employment took a bigger-than-expected drop of
267,000.
   Analysts saw the data as strong corroborating evidence that the
economy has slipped into recession.
   The fresh evidence of weakness in business activity sent
interest rates lower in the U.S. government securities market.
   But stock traders greeted it less enthusiastically, given the
questions it raised about the prospective length and depth of the
recession and the outlook for corporate profits.
   Humana fell 1~ to 43{ in active trading. On Thursday the company
estimated a smaller quarterly earnings gain than some analysts had
expected, and predicted a continued narrowing of profit margins in
the hospital business.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
.39 to 179.32. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .50 at 305.85.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 139.20 million shares with an

<HEAD>Worst of the Gulf Oil Crisis is Over, Energy Secretary Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Gulf-Oil Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIRK BEVERIDGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The oil crisis brought on by Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait has pretty much run its course, and there will probably be
no reason for crude prices to jump even if war breaks out, Energy
Secretary James Watkins said Friday.
   ``From an energy perspective, I believe we are through the worst
of the crisis,'' Watkins said a day after returning from a visit to
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
   Watkins said a war with Iraq should not cause concern among oil
buyers because he sees no military threat to Middle East production
facilities and he plans to ask President Bush to tap into the U.S.
Strategic Petroleum Reserve if hostilities break out. The
government recently conducted test sales of oil from the reserve
that went smoothly, the secretary said.
   ``It works and works well,'' Watkins said in an address to the
Jewish Community Relations Council of New York.
   Some oil experts have estimated that crude prices could shoot as
high as $100 per barrel if war breaks out. But Watkins said that if
hostilities develop, ``I hope players in the oil market will keep
their hats on.''
   A combination of higher oil production and conservation has
virtually eliminated the shortfall of 4.3 million barrels per day
created by the global boycott of Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude
implemented after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, he said.
   After the invasion, fears of supply disruptions in the event of
war pushed oil above $40 per barrel, although it has since fallen
back to less than $30 as world production was increased and
international leaders have adopted a more conciliatory stance in
recent days.
   Light sweet crude oil closed Friday at $26.58 per barrel, up 18
cents, for January delivery contracts at the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   Watkins said he doubted the Iraqis could harm oil facilities,
since they were unable to cripple Iran's oil production during
their drawn-out war of the 1980s. The secretary, who is a retired
admiral, said he went to the Persian Gulf for his visit of almost a
week to get a first-hand look at the security of the oil supply.
   ``I do not believe the Iraqi air force is a threat to Saudi or
UAE fields, nor can I imagine a successful Iraqi ground attack,''
Watkins said. Even if there were some kind of unpredictable cutoff,
``we would still have six weeks worth of oil in the water.''
   He was referring to the lag time in shipping crude from the
Middle East to the United States.
   Watkins said the world is already experiencing an oil glut that
will only intensify after the crisis ends. He said it might provide
an opportunity for the United States to expand the strategic
reserve, where the government stores millions of barrels of crude
oil in Texas and Louisiana salt caverns.
   ``We want to go from the current 590 million barrels in our
Strategic Petroleum Reserve to a billion barrels,'' he said.
   During a session Friday afternoon with reporters, Watkins said
the United States was continuing discussions with producing nations
who might want to ``lease'' oil for the Strategic Petroluem Reserve
once the crisis ends. Under that arrangement, the United States
would pay a small fee as the producing nations put oil into the
salt caverns.
   Later, the oil could be auctioned off by the government in the
same manner existing reserves are set to be auctioned.

<HEAD>Coffee-Trading Nations Fail to Make Progress on Price Pact</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coffee-trading nations on Friday failed to make
progress on a new international agreement to lift and stabilize
depressed world coffee prices.
   Delegates said Colombia and several African countries renewed
their call for a speedy start to negotiations on a new accord to
regulate exports and prices.
   They provided figures showing a sharp drop in export earnings,
said Nestor Osorio, Colombia's delegate to the International Coffee
Organization's 16-nation executive board.
   But Brazil, the world's largest coffee producer and exporter,
said it was not ready to enter talks on a new pact. The board thus
decided it could not set a timetable for negotiations to begin,
delegates said.
   The former International Coffee Agreement was abandoned in July
1988, opening the way to a flood of sales and a drop in prices.
Coffee prices last year hit a 14-year low of 59 cents per pound -
half the amount the agreement had tried to guarantee.
   On Friday, coffee was priced at 71 cents a pound.
   Figures released by the organization Friday showed a sharp rise
in export volume, but a dramatic drop in earnings in the last
international coffee marketing year.
   World shipments of beans between October 1989 and September 1990
rose to 78.89 million 132-pound bags from 70.87 million bags the
previous year.
   Export earnings slumped to $6.52 billion from $9.15 billion the
previous year. Earnings peaked at $14.36 billion in the 1985-1986
fiscal year.

<HEAD>Dollar Down Sharply</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar registered a sharp decline Friday,
shaken by a worse-than-expected U.S. unemployment report and
falling interest rates.
   Gold prices also lost ground. On the New York Commodity
Exchange, gold fell $1.40 a troy ounce to settle at $370.30. Later,
Republic National Bank quoted a late bid for gold at $369.30 an
ounce, off $1.70.
   The dollar declined overseas and opened on a very weak note when
trading shifted to domestic markets. A Labor Department report
showing civilian unemployment jumped 0.2 percent in November to 5.9
percent, its worst level in three years, ``got the market moving,''
said Stephen Flanagan, a vice president at Mitsubishi Bank Ltd.
   The report offered indisputable evidence the nation has slipped
into a recession and prompted the Federal Reserve and a handful of
banks to take steps to ease interest rates.
   Lower interest rates make dollar-denominated securities less
valuable and therefore reduce investors' need for the U.S.
currency.
   There were unconfirmed reports that the Fed stepped in to
support the dollar against the German mark, Flanagan said, adding
that the dollar did move up after the rumored intervention.
   But traders are expecting interest rate differentials to become
more unfavrrable for the dollar, as U.S. rates decline while some
key foreign rates remain steady. That would put further pressure on
the dollar.
   Also pushing the dollar down was an easing of tensions in the
Persian Gulf conflict following Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's
offer to release all hostages.
   ``The war premium was wiped out this week,'' said Kevin Lawrie,
a vice president at the Bank of Boston's office here.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 132.17 Japanese yen from
134.05 yen at Thursday's close. Later in London, it fell to 131.05
yen. In New York the dollar closed at 130.70 yen, down from 132.14
yen on Thursday.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.9510 from $1.9390 late
Thursday. In New York it cost $1.9535 to buy one pound, more
expensive than Thursday's $1.9400.
   Other late dollar rastes in New York, compared with late
Thursday's rates, included: 1.4720 German marks, down from 1.4885;
1.2532 Swiss francs, down from 1.2710; 4.9975 French francs, down
from 5.0510; 1,110.00 Italian lire, down from 1,122.25, and 1.1580
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1621.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday,
included: 1.4775 German marks, down from 1.4890; 1.2615 Swiss
francs, down from 1.2725; 5.0161 French francs, down from 5.0540;
1.6675 Dutch guilders, down from 1.6805; 1,113.75 Italian lire,
down from 1,122.25; and 1.1590 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1621.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $371.00 a troy ounce,
up from $370.25 bid per ounce late Thursday. In Zurich, the metal
rose to a closing bid of $371.50, up from $369.50. Earlier in Hong
Kong, gold fell $2.41 to close at a bid $371.83.
   Silver prices also fell. On New York's Comex, silver settled at
$4.055 a troy ounce, down from Thursday's $4.121. In London the
metal fell to a late bid price of $4.14 a troy ounce, from $4.16.

   Like an invading virus, the regional real estate slump is now a
nationwide affliction, making memories out of work-swamped
California builders, 30-minute Seattle home sales and Florida
condos crawling with prospective retirees.
   Further darkening the picture, property experts say, are
indications that the sickly Northeast's real estate industry has
slipped even further, with rentals now following the steep price
declines once confined to for-sale units.
   New York is ``close to being a housing depression,'' said Robert
Villanueva, economic forecaster for the National Association of
Home Builders.
   Not everyone is dejected, of course - prospective buyers and
renters can get great deals. Moreover, a few sections of the
country, such as Texas, are just now bouncing back from earlier
downturns.
   But the slumps in once prosperous holdouts has forced developers
and real estate agencies to lay off thousands of employees and has
stranded many homeowners with expensive properties they can't sell
without taking a loss.
   The grim news is told in recent statistics and in war stories
from participants.
   In its first decline in more than a decade of nearly
uninterrupted growth, housing starts in California plunged nearly
30 percent this year, roughly twice the national rate, the National
Association of Home Builders says.
   Auctions, once associated with debt-swamped farmers, now account
for more than 50 percent of southern California home sales, by some
reckonings.
   The problem, particularly in southern California, is that
developers built too many luxury homes in their zeal to exploit the
state's burgeoning population and affluence.
   ``It's a case of oversupply and not an equal demand,'' saidTerry
Yapp, a real estate agent in Mission Viejo, an affluent suburb 60
miles south of Los Angeles.
   Thousands of California property brokers are expected to leave
the business by the en  of the year. Century 21, a leading
homeseller, closed about 30 of its southern California offices this
year.
   In its first auction of unsold housing units, Kaufman &amp; Broad
Home Corp., one of California's largest home builders, last month
sold 36 luxury homes for roughly 25 percent less than their
original asking prices of $350,000-$375,000.
   ``We're not exactly on the average broker's Christmas card
list,'' said William Lange, president of Lang Financial Corp.,
which conducted the auction.
   Seattle's reputation as one of the nation's most livable cities
drew tens of thousands in the last five years. But in 1990, housing
prices plummeted 15 percent after rising 30 percent to 40 percent
annually in recent years, said Charles Henderson, president of
Henderson Homes, a major Seattle home builder.
   ``In January it took 30 minutes'' to sell a home after it was
put on market, he said. Now it takes price cuts and months of
waiting to lure wary buyers.
   Florida's boom has been zapped partly because Northeasterners
are having so much trouble selling homes. This means the supply of
people seeking to move to Florida upon retirement has dried up.
   Also hurting sales, Florida builders say, are recent state
regulations requiring the building of roads, sewers and other
infrastructures before housing is approved.
   Moreover, many banks have tightened credit restrictions making
it exceedingly difficult for builders to finance new developments.
   ``We have felt it dramatically. A number of our banks have gone
out of business,'' said Ronald S. Ellish, who owns a small Florida
building firm.
   Ryan Homes, once one of the state's largest home builders,
recently withdrew from the state because it wasn't making money,
the suburban Washington D.C.-based company has said.
   In south Florida's Lee County, one of the state's fastest
growing regions, ``in the last year alone we have lost over 1,000
employees in the construction industry,'' said Michael Reitmann,
executive vice president of the county's Building Industry
Association.
   One of the more visible signs of the times is the planned
auction on Dec. 16 of units in Donald Trump's 32-story Trump Plaza
in West Palm Beach, where bidding for the luxury condominiums and
town homes starts at half of the original $300,000 asking price.
   The situation is familiar to many New Yorkers who for the past
two years have grimly watched their Manhattan homes plummet in
value.
   Joe Mandese, 32, a journalist, says he and his wife placed their
Greenwich Village studio on the market in 1988 for roughly
$125,000, two years after they bought it for $100,000. Now they
would be grateful to get $89,500 for it.
   On the other hand, many Manhattan renters are benefiting from
owner misery.
   For the first time since the Great Depression, rents in the five
boroughs are dropping, driven down by an oversupply of rental units
caused partly by owners renting out their property rather than
selling at a loss.
   A luxury studio on swank Central Park south, for example, which
rented in April 1988 for $1,900 a month, recently was let for
$1,150, according to the Feathered Nest, a Manhattan property
agency.

<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve and a handful of banks moved
Friday to cut interest rates after the government reported the
biggest jobless increase in three years, graphic evidence that a
recession is sapping the nation's economic strength.
   For the third time in six weeks the nation's central took subtle
steps to make more money available for banks to lend. The move also
raised speculation that the Fed might take even more dramatic steps
later to reduce the cost of borrowing to stimulate economic growth.
   In addition, three banks cut the prime lending rate for the
first time in nearly a year, nudging it to 9} percent from 10
percent. The prime rate is a base used by banks for pricing a range
of businesses and consumer loans, including many types of
mortgages.
   A reduction in the prime means that many people who may have
delayed the purchase of a home or car, for example, would
reconsider because a loan is more affordable.
   The rate cut, effective Monday, raised anticipation that others
would follow. William Sullivan, director of money market research
at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. predicted the 9} percent ``will become
the industry-wide benchmark by early next week.''
   The largest bank to trim the prime was First Fidelity Bancorp,
the nation's 20th largest banking company and the largest bank in
New Jersey. Also announcing cuts were Manufacturers &amp; Traders Trust
of Buffalo, N.Y., and Southwest Bank of St. Louis, historically a
maverick rate-cutter.
   Major banks last cut the rate by 0.5 percent to 10 percent on
Jan. 8.
   Still, analysts said major banks remain concerned about their
profit margins and were hesitating to mark rates down until they
had a sense the Fed would act in tandem.
   Indications that the Fed was allowing rates to drift lower
surfaced around midday. The federal funds rate, the rate banks
charge each other on overnight loans, stood at 7 1-16 percent, down
from 7 7-16 percent earlier in the week.
   The shift in Fed policy was confirmed a bit later when the
central bank announced it was injecting $1.5 billion into the
banking system, a move designed to encourage banks to make funds
more available.
   `TThe infusion of reserves was a clear signal by the Fed'' that
it has eased monetary policy, Sullivan said.
   But many economists criticized the Fed's reluctance to take
stronger action immediately. They complained that the nation was
sliding toward a needlessly severe recession because interest rates
haven't come down quickly.
   ``There is a lot of dissension (within the Fed) about what the
right policy is, and the Fed has been slow to accept that the
economy is in recession,'' said Robert Brusca, chief economist at
Nikko Securities Co. International Inc.
   A Labor Department report issued Friday appeared to be the
decisive piece of evidence that convinced recalcitrant observers
that the nation is in the throes of a recession. The report showed
the unemployment rate climbed 0.2 percent to 5.9 percent in
November, the highest level in three years.
   ``No doubt this figure will resurrect the economy as a political
issue,'' Sullivan said. ``It is clear from the employment report
that the economy has lost a substantial amount of momentum ... The
figure not only points to weakness in the job market, but also
suggests deterioration in production and income growth.''
   Government officials have beseeched the nation's banks in recent
weeks to broaden lending practices rather than continue to tighten
credit and choke off customers in need of funds.
   While cuts in the prime rate, which reflects a bank's cost of
borrowing money, are expected to be held to a quarter of a
percentage point, analysts say still lower rates are likely.
   Some economists believe the Fed will cut another key rate, the
discount rate or the rate it charges on loans to member banks, by
0.5 percent sometime around the new year. That would be the first
change in the discount rate since Feb. 24, 1989, when it moved from
6.5 percent to 7 percent, and it likely would result in a further
prime rate cut by the nation's banks.

<HEAD>Lawyers Fight $625 Million Eagle-Picher Settlement Plan</HEAD>

   Lawyers for thousands of asbestos disease
victims on Friday fought a compensation plan by Eagle-Picher
Industries Inc. that would mark a key step in ending the biggest
product liability mess clogging the courts.
   The lawyers charged the $625 million plan allocates too little
money for workers suffering cancer and other respiratory diseases
and could further delay payments to 65,000 claimants for five or
more years.
   Eagle-Picher is widely considered a test case in efforts to
resolve the ilemma of compensating American workers ill and dying
from exposure to asbestos, a mineral used for decades in shipyards
and construction.
   U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein wants the company and
plaintiffs' lawyers to reach a settlement so he can declare a
class-action to handle all the cases at once, eliminating long and
costly trials that are diverting money that could be used to pay
victims.
   Under an agreement between the company and two plaintiffs
lawyers, claimants would be paid from a trust funded with annual
cash payments by Eagle-Picher and company stock. The total value of
the trust over 20 years was placed at about $625 million, plus at
least 25 percent of the company's shares.
   But other plaintiffs lawyers urged Weinstein to reject the plan,
saying financially tottering Eagle-Picher might be worth more to
victims if it declares Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection.
   ``I say there's too much delay in this agreement and not enough
remedies,'' said Henry G. Miller, one of four attorneys appointed
by Weinstein to represent claimants. Two backed the plan and two
opposed it.
   The plan provides that payments to victims would begin in
November 1993 at the soonest, and could be delayed by court
appeals. Eagle-Picher would pay $460 million spread out over 20
years, $45 million for already negotiated claims and an estimated
$120 million in proceeds from the company's operations.
   Eagle Picher Chairman Thomas E. Petry said if no settlement is
reached, ``I believe we'll be in bankruptcy.''
   ``We are within days of a cash squeeze, a cash crisis,'' he
said.
   Eagle-Picher, a Cincinnati-based maker of automobile and
industrial products, has said it cannot meet its asbestos
liabilities, now estimated at $600 million. It already has spent
$540 million in the last five years on asbestos obligations.
   But Miller told the judge that, in contrast to Eagle-Picher
estimates, the estimated present value of the proposal for asbestos
victims was at most $244 million while Chapter 11 could provide
$296 million. He also said the plan lacked safeguards for victims
should the company go under.
   Weinstein has supported a mass settlement to clear court dockets
nationwide of about 90,000 asbestos lawsuits, which has put a
severe drain on dozens of companies threatened by asbestos
liabilities.
   But at a crowded hearing in federal court in Brooklyn, some
attorneys accused Weinstein of trying to railroad a plan through
the courts and said he was flouting judicial procedure.
   They also accused the court-appointed attorneys who devised the
plan - Stanley Chesley of Cincinnati and David I. Shapiro of
Washington - of selling out victims in exchange for a quick
resolution.
   ``My clients will have more insults heaped upon them that the
insults they have already received at the hands of Eagle-Picher,''
said Gene Locks, a Philadelphia plaintiffs lawyer who criticized
the plan.
   Locks called the process for reaching a settlement ``publicly
embarrassing'' and promised to fight a settlement through appeals.
   But Chesley told the judge the plan was far better than a
bankruptcy filing because the long-term value to victims depended
on Eagle-Picher's future success.
   Eagle-Picher has sold tens of millions of dollars in assets in
recent years to meet asbestos payments. But the settlement's
backers said the company has little left to sell, its insurance is
running out and it woon won't be able to generate enough cash from
operations to meet obligations.
   Dozens of former asbestos makers and users are scrutinizing the
case, which could become a model for companies to resolve asbestos
liabilities. Payments to victims have been delayed years and many
workers have died before getting money.
   A separate case involves the Manville trust fund, created in the
bankruptcy reorganization of Manville Corp. Earlier this year the
trust ran out of money to pay new claims. A proposal to restructure
the trust, which faces 130,000 claims, is pending before Weinstein.

   The stock market drifted lower Friday, faced
with gloomy news on employment.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 12.38 to
2,590.10, reducing its gain for the week to 30.45 points.
   Declining issues slightly outnumbered advances in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 759 up, 778
down and 500 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 164.95 million
shares, down from 256.38 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 199.71 million shares.
   The Labor Department reported that the civilian unemployment
rate jumped 0.2 percentage point, to 5.9 percent, in November, and
that nonfarm payroll employment took a bigger-than-expected drop of
267,000.
   Analysts saw the data as strong corroborating evidence that the
economy has slipped into recession.
   The fresh evidence of weakness in business activity sent
interest rates lower in the U.S. government securities market.
   Prices of long-term government bonds jumped more than $15 for
each $1,000 in face value, cutting their yields to the neighborhood
of 8.18 percent - the lowest level in about 11 months.
   But stock traders greeted it less enthusiastically, given the
questions it raised about the prospective length and depth of the
recession and the outlook for corporate profits.
   Citicorp dropped &lsqb; to 14} as the most active NYSE issue after
Chairman John Reed spoke of continued high levels of writeoffs in
the company's commercial real-estate loan portfolio for the current
quarter and next year as well.
   Security Pacific Corp., which withdrew a pending offering of
notes, tumbled 3 to 22.
   Among other bank stocks, BankAmerica fell 1\ to 24; Wells Fargo
2~ to 55\; J.P. Morgan &rsqb; to 43&rsqb;, and Chase Manhattan | to 11}.
   Humana slumped 1~ to 43{ in active trading. On Thursday the

<HEAD>Troubled Cities Go All Out to Woo Investors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID E. KALISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When The Bond Buyer held a conference at the
Manhattan's Plaza Hotel in honor of the financial publication's
100th anniversary last month, the black tie affair looked something
like a mayors' convention.
   Government officials from roughly 30 municipalities ranging from
Delaware to Detroit came to town in the hope they might woo
investors to buy their municipal bonds.
   Such hard-sell scenes are becoming more and more frequent these
days. With the nation's widely reported economic downturn placing
many municipalities on shaky financial ground, government officials
increasingly are renting out plush convention space and polishing
their pitches to put their cities' best foot forward.
   They have their work cut out for them. In the first nine months
of 1990 Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. downgraded 285 municipal bonds and
upgraded 111.
   ``The underlying concept is that it's better to hear it straight
from the horse's mouth rather than to read an article scaring you.
It's the only way you get a chance to personally assess the
management qualities of a city or state,'' said Claire Cohen,
executive managing director for government finance at Fitch
Investors Service.
   For example, late last month New York City Mayor David Dinkins,
head of the biggest municipal bond borrower in the world, feted
potential buyers at a swank conference in a midtown Manhattan
hotel.
   The affair came several weeks in advance of the city's $950
million sale of general obligation bonds needed to keep the
government running, and investors had some hard questions on how
the city proposed to balance its budget and pay its future debt.
   While Moody's Investor Service rates New York's bonds a fairly
respectable A, the city's big budget deficit has prompted worries
among investors that the rating could be lowered.
   But cities have quickly discovered the art of bond salesmanship
is different than, say, selling used cars.
   ``They have learned that they had better be very, very honest
and forthright because many investors and dealers can read a
financial statement just as well as anyone in the administration
can,'' said John V. Sebastian, chief economist for Clayton Brown &amp;
Associates, a Chicago-based public securities firm.
   Investors are sometimes reticent to have their biggest concerns
addressed in public, so municipalities are looking for
opportunities to maximize private interaction.
   At the conference sponsored by the Bond Buyer trade newspaper,
``you would have a casual opportunity during coffee breaks or
between sessions to go up to public officials and have
conversations about whatever was on your mind,'' said Ms. Cohen of
Fitch.
   Another way cities are selling themselves is by sharpening their
pencils.
   ``Ten years ago New York City would simply issue one to two
sheets of paper telling what financing they are planning and what
they are raising and their scheduling of repayment,'' said
Sebastian, the economist.
   Now, many large cities are issuing sophisticated fiscal reports
showing everything from cash flow to projected income, he said, not
unlike the comprehensive annual reports corporations issue to
stockholders.
   But sometimes all the slick salesmanship in the world can't
change investors' minds. Last month, for example, Moody's Investor
Service demoted two more series of Philadelphia's municipal bonds
to junk-bond status. The move came after the city's general
obligation bonds were dropped in September to junk-bond level by
the rating services.
   ``We have conceded that we have no capacity to re-enter the
market,'' said Betsy Reveal, Philadelphia's director of finance.
   The city now has the lowest credit rating of any major municipal
borrower. Trying to avoid insolvency without the bond market's
help, the city is trying to wrangle an unusual transaction that
involves borrowing from local and state pension funds and local
banks to secure short-term cash to keep the government running.

   Maybe they should change the name to Goya
Feuds.
   A 20-year-old family squabble has spilled into court at Goya
Foods Inc., which grew from a small Puerto Rican rice, bean and
spice business into a $300 million-a-year food empire.
   At issue is the will of Prudencio Unanue, the family patriarch
who founded Goya more than 50 years ago. His son is suing other
family members, and says hundreds of millions of dollars are at
stake.
   After a tax dispute with other family members, Charles Unanue
walked away from Goya in 1974 with a $4.3 million settlement and an
agreement not to seek any inheritance from his father.
   Prudencio Unanue died in 1976, leaving his 18 grandchildren
controlling interest in the company. But under Puerto Rican
commonwealth law, parents are not allowed to disinherit their
children. Charles Unanue says he agreed not to seek an inheritance
while his father was living in Puerto Rico, so the will doesn't
stand.
   ``There is no moral question here,'' Jan Brodey, Charles
Unanue's attorney, said. ``Charlie believes that if he's entitled
by right to inherit from his father, then he has a right to it,
period.''
   Attorneys for Goya and the other family members dispute the
claim.
   A state Superior Court judge in Hackensack was to rule on the
legality of Prudencio's will, but a decision was put on hold when
Charles filed for personal bankruptcy in Puerto Rico in August.
Under federal law, lawsuits involving people who file for
bankruptcy are delayed until the court decides whether they can
continue.
   The internal dispute at Goya appears to have done little to
tarnish the success of the nation's largest Hispanic-owned
business.
   Founded by Prudencio Unanue in 1936, Goya started out importing
sardines, beans and olive oil. Now the family's frozen vegetables
and canned goods are found from corner bodegas in Manhattan to
swanky Miami supermarkets.
   Goya, which has operations in Chicago, Miami, Spain and the
Dominican Republic, dominates the sale of Caribbean and Spanish
foods in the eastern United States and Caribbean.
   Analysts said Goya, based in Secaucus, has been the largest
Hispanic-owned company since rum manufacturer Bacardi Corp. of
Puerto Rico and Banco Popular de Puerto Rico became publicly held
operations.
   ``If there have been problems, they haven't hurt the overall
success of the company,'' said Leonard Teitelbaum, an analyst with
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. ``It may have been more successful had it not
been for the problems, but it has still done quite well.''
   The dispute began nearly 20 years ago when Charles Unanue
claimed Goya was cheating on its taxes. He threatened legal action.
The family settled out of court, and Charles agreed to take $4.3
million and forsake any claim to an inheritance.
   Brodey said Charles Unanue was largely responsible for the
company's success, and didn't want to be associated with any legal
action against it.
   ``So they dumped him,'' Brodey said. ``But it wasn't like he was
collecting any money that wasn't his. What he was given was what
they determined his share of the company was.''
   The alleged tax violations never were brought into criminal or
civil proceedings.
   Unanue claims he only recently learned about the Puerto Rican
law barring parents from disinherting children, and he has moved to
have his father's will reprobated in Puerto Rico.
   Michael Griffinger, an attorney for Goya and the Unanue family,
said Charles Unanue's claim that several hundred millions of
dollars are at stake is exaggerated. But he conceded that a large
amount of money is in dispute.
   Griffinger said the family ``has been absolutely harmonious and
unified except for Charles.''
   ``The family felt he wasn't pulling his load,'' he said. ``There
were a number of meetings and discussions, and he said he wanted to
be bought out. Every bit of litigation with Charles was settled,
and now he's coming back looking for more.''

<HEAD>Jump in Unemployment Sends Platinum Prices Lower</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Precious metals on Friday continued their slide on New York's
Commodity Exchange, paced by a sharp drop in platinum prices that
was caused by a jump in U.S. unemployment.
   Silver prices were also hard hit, at one point tumbling to
contract lows. Both platinum and silver are heavily used in
industry.
   On other markets, grain and soybean futures were mostly lower;
copper futures dropped; livestock and pork futures were higher; and
energy futures gained.
   The selloff in platinum came after the release of unemployment
figures by the U.S. Labor Department showing joblessness in
November reached a three-year high of 5.9 percent.
   Platinum settled $7.90 to $8.50 lower with the contract for
delivery in January at $413.40 a troy ounce.
   Peter Cardillo, an analyst with Jesup Josephthal &amp; Co. Inc. in
New York, said the silver market also was sharply affected by the
decline in employment.
   Platinum is used in the catalytic converters of automobiles and
in jewelry. Silver is both a luxury item and is used in the
photography industry.
   ``If you have a recessionary atmosphere, it dampens the future
prospects of the metal,'' Cardillo said.
   The unemployment figures gave some support to the gold market.
Gold is usually a safe haven in times of economic uncertainty. But
the imminent release of hostages in Iraq and the resulting
perceptions of peace weighed on gold futures, analysts said.
   Gold was $1.10 to $1.90 lower with February at $372.10 a troy
ounce; silver was 6.2 cents to 7.8 cents lower with December at
$4.055 a troy ounce.
   Recessionary fears also forced copper prices lower on the Comex.
   Copper was 1.45 cents to 3.10 cents lower with the contract for
delivery in December at $1.1015 a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly lower on the
Chicago Board of Trade as a lack of news on U.S. aid to the Soviet
Union took its toll on the market.
   The market has been awaiting announcement that the United States
will extend about $1.2 billion in export credits to the Soviet
Union so that nation can buy U.S. farm products. However, nothing
has come of talks between Soviet officials and the U.S. Agriculture
Department.
   Analysts also noted that the market was hurt by the failure of
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks in Brussels.
   Wheat futures showed gains on aggressive buying by commercial
houses and by Egypt's purchase of 200,000 metric tons of soft white
wheat under the export bonus program, said Paul Sylvester, an
analyst with Gerald Inc. in Chicago.
   Wheat was 2\ cents to 6 cents higher with the contract for
delivery in December at $2.53 a bushel; corn was 1\ cents lower to
a \ cent higher with December at $2.26 a bushel; oats were a { cent
to 1} cents lower with December at $1.10 a bushel; soybeans were 1{
cents to 4 cents lower with January at $5.95 a bushel.
   Energy futures posted modest gains on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, with traders citing the lack of new Middle East
developments for quiet trading.
   Jim Ritterbusch, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. in Chicago,
said the huge drops in futures prices caused by expectations the
Persian Gulf crisis will be resolved peacefully brought in some
buying interest.
   Light sweet crude was 18 cents to 51 cents higher with January
at $26.58 a barrel; heating oil was .54 cent lower to .60 cent
higher with January at 79.17 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was
.20 cent lower to .40 cent higher with January at 66.47 cents a
gallon.
   Livestock and pork futures were higher on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
   Pork futures were higher on perceptions of oversold conditions,
and cattle futures climbed as cash prices continued strong.
   Live cattle were .20 cent to .75 cent higher with December at
79.92 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .08 cent to .75 cent higher
with January at 88.87 cents a pound; live hogs were .15 cent to .57
cent higher with December at 49.27 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were 1.17 cents to 1.85 cents higher with February at 64.70
cents a pound.

   Oil prices showed little change Friday as
traders paused to wonder what crude might do next, after a dramatic
weeklong slide based on perceptions that peace could break out in
the Persian Gulf.
   ``When the market moves like this one has, it tends to get a
little bit overdone and then moves back,'' said Brian Tagler, an
oil broker with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
   Light sweet crude oil rose 18 cents to $26.58 per barrel at the
New York Mercantile Exchange on contracts for delivery in January.
   For the week, oil was down $2.27 per barrel for next-month
delivery. After a big fall of $4.06 per barrel on Nov. 30, this
week's losses dropped oil into a price range it had not seen since
August, the month Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   Crude's fall also brought unleaded gasoline futures down to
ugust levels. The dive began last week when President Bush offered
to hold top-level diplomatic sessions with the Iraqis.
   Oil kept falling this week, first when Iraq accepted the offer,
and later when Iraqi President Saddam Hussein announced plans to
free all of his hostages.
   Oil traders said the market seemed due for its its slight bounce
up on Friday, and some were surprised it didn't rise even more.
   ``We came down awfully fast over the past couple of days and
this is a little bit of a correction,'' said Thomas P. Blakeslee,
an energy analyst with Pegasus Econometric Group Inc., in Hoboken,
N.J. ``Even though there's new peace hopes, you have to look at
them with a grain of salt.''
   Futures contracts for home heating oil and unleaded gasoline
were mixed, though none of them moved by as much as 1 cent a
gallon. Some traders were selling heating oil contracts and buying
unleaded gasoline contracts just because gasoline seemed like a
relative bargain at about 12 cents a gallon cheaper than the
heating oil, Blakeslee said.
   Heating oil closed down .54 cent at 79.17 cents a gallon for
January delivery. Unleaded gasoline was down .13 cent at 66.47
cents a gallon for January delivery.
   For the week, unleaded gasoline fell 11.11 cents a gallon for
next-month delivery, while home heating oil fell 6.70 cents a
gallon.
   Natural gas, which is not directly affected by fears of war in
the Persian Gulf, also showed little direction Friday. The January
delivery contract fell .1 cent to $2.350 per 1,000 cubic feet. For
the week, gas dropped 9.5 cents for January delivery.

   The worst two-month stretch of layoffs since
the 1981-82 recession pushed civilian unemployment to a three-year
high of 5.9 percent in November, the govenment said Friday.
   Payrolls fell by 267,000 last month, the Labor Department said,
after a 180,000-job loss in October. Since June, when the
unemployment rate was 5.2 percent, nearly 1 million Americans have
joined the ranks of the unemployed.
   Practically all the nation's industries have been affected.
   ``This report looks like a recession. It walks like a recession.
... It is a recession,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist at the
Boston Co. ``And it's full-fledged, accelerating and widespread.''
   In apparent response, the Federal Reserve moved to stimulate the
economy by nudging interest rates lower. It pushed the rate charged
among banks for overnight loans to 7 1-16 percent, down from 7 7-16
percent earlier in the week.
   A handful of banks trimmed their prime rate from 10 percent to
9} percent. A wide variety of business and consumer loans are tied
to the prime.
   November's 5.9 percent jobless rate was the highest since
unemployment was 6 percent in October 1987. Many analysts predict
unemployment could hit 7 percent next year.
   ``The negative momentum is not yet spent. ... We are in the
heart of the downturn now. There is no turning back. It cannot be
reversed. The question is how deep and how long will it last?''
Sinai said.
   Added Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co.:
   ``This recession looks about as bad as any recession can look.
... It deepened in November; the pace has accelerated.''
   ``We have a vicious cycle going here. The more people you lay
off, the less they're going to buy, the less businesses can
produce, the more people they lay off.''
   With 7.3 million Americans looking for work but unable to find
it, November's losses hit hardest in the manufacturing sector,
which has been sliding downhill for months. Factory payrolls
declined by 200,000, the biggest one-month drop since 1982.
   The automobile industry alone lost 55,000 jobs, reflecting
temporary shutdowns to avoid excessive inventory buildups.
   Construction lost 62,000 jobs as the housing market continued to
deteriorate. Over the last six months, that industry has seen jobs
tumble by about 250,000.
   The service-producing sector, which until a few months ago had
been enjoying healthy job gains and keeping the economy steaming
ahead, showed widespread weakness too.
   Retail trade lost 70,000 jobs because general merchandise stores
are falling short on their normal seasonal hirings. Employment also
fell in wholesale trade and in finance, insurance and real estate.
   All the job-loss calculations are seasonally adjusted.
   Health services continued to boom, adding 80,000 jobs. Over the
last year, that industry has added more than 600,000 jobs.
   Labor costs, frequently blamed for intensifying the nation's
inflation problems, rose only slightly in November. The average
hourly worker made $10.13 an hour last month, up one cent from
October.
   Overall, total civilian employment was about 117.3 million in
November, down about 450,000 from the 117.7 million employed in
October.
   In another sign of weakness, the average manufacturing work week
was 40.5 hours in November, down from the 40.7 hours in October.
Manufacturing overtime was an average of 3.5 hours last month, down
from 3.6 hours in October.
   In a separate calculation of unemployment that counts members of
the armed services stationed in the United States, the November
jobless rate was 5.8 percent, up from October's 5.6 percent rate.

   Member brokerage firms of the New York Stock
Exchange posted a combined loss of $124 million after taxes in the
third quarter, the exchange said Friday.
   The loss compared with a profit of $471 million in 1989's third
quarter.
   Brokerage houses have suffered this year as small investors have
shied away from investing in stocks, due in part to uncertainty
over the economy. Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait has increased
investor concern over stocks, experts say.
   The firms have also seen a slowdown in mergers, takeovers and
other big deals that generated fat fees in the 1980s.
   The NYSE said only 161 of its 334 firms reporting results for
the third quarter were profitable during the period.
   Revenue in the third quarter fell 13 percent to $13.1 billion
from $15.1 billion in 1989's third quarter, the NYSE said.
   For the year's first nine months, the brokerages reported a
profit after taxes of $22 million, down 98 percent from $1.28
billion in 1989's first nine months.
   Revenue totaled $40.8 billion, down from $45.1 billion in the
year-ago period, the NYSE said.
   The figures include revenue from all sources, including trading,
commissions and interest.
   The exchange also said its specialist firms - those that only
trade in the stock of one or a handful of companies and keep their
trading orderly - posted a loss in the third quarter of $19
million, compared with an after-tax profit of $17 million in 1989's
third quarter.

<HEAD>Macy Reports $56.5 Million First-Quarter Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   R.H. Macy Co. Inc. said Friday it lost $56.5
million during its first quarter as the retailer's sales, hurt by
the weakening economy and the Middle Eat crisis, tumbled nearly 10
percent.
   The closely held Macy, which is still paying the costs of a 1986
leveraged buyout, said its loss in the quarter ended Oct. 27
translated to $38.53 per share and compared with a shortfall of
$33.1 million, or $23.92 per share, in the same period a year
earlier.
   Macy's results in the latest quarter reflected a $10.2 million
gain related to a repurchase of some of the retailer's bonds.
   The results, contained a quarterly filing with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, were expected after published reports said
Macy's first-quarter loss nearly doubled from a year earlier.
   The company said its first-quarter sales declined to $1.55
billion from $1.71 billion.
   Macy suffered from the same drop-off in business that struck
other retailers after the Middle East crisis erupted in early
August. Consumers, already spending cautiously because of the
weakening economy, put purchases of non-essentials such as
clothing, appliances and furniture on hold as oil prices shot
higher.
   Macy said its performance was also adversely affected by
warmer-than-usual weather that slowed apparel sales. The company
said its sales were particularly hard hit in the Northeast, where
the economy has weakened considerably.
   The retailer has come under sharp scrutiny after it suffered a
disastrous Christmas season a year ago. The current holiday season
is proving to be difficult for all retailers, but Macy spokesman
James Fingeroth said Friday the company so far has not been forced
to make steep markdowns to bring in sales.
   Macy has taken a number of steps to reduce its debt load and its
losses, including the sale of stock and buybacks of some of the
junk bonds used to finance its $3.74 billion leveraged buyout.
   The company is also selling its credit operations to GE Capital
Corp. In its filing Friday, Macy said it expected that sale to be
completed by February.
   In the filing, Macy listed its debt at the end of the fiscal
year at $4.32 billion. The retailer expects, after accounting for
asset sales and bond buybacks, to be left with $3 billion in
long-term liabilities.

   A jury Friday awarded $6 million to a state
supreme court justice, saying The Philadelphia Inquirer defamed him
in a reprint of a 1983 series about the court's conduct.
   The jury, which deliberated nine hours over two days following a
seven-week trial, found the reprint was false and defamatory, but
that the original series was not false.
   ``The verdict is bizarre because they said the articles
themselves were true but they were false when they were
reprinted,'' said William Hangley, the Inquirer's lawyer.
   Hangley suggested the jury may have considered an editorial and
cartoon also included in the tabloid reprint.
   He said the paper will appeal.
   ``We are confident this result cannot stand,'' he said.
   The jurors refused to comment after the verdict.
   The award was the second libel judgment against the Inquirer
this year.
   Common Pleas Court Judge John Lavelle had told the jury that
Justice James T. McDermott had to prove the articles, written by
reporter Daniel Biddle, were defamatory, false and published with
actual malice, and that he suffered harm.
   The Inquirer has won 17 Pulitzer Prizes during the past two
decades, including one by Biddle for another court series.
   Last May, a jury awarded Philadelphia lawyer Richard Sprague a
record $34 million over a 1973 story that criticized his handling
of a homicide case when he was an assistant district attorney. The
Inquirer is appealing.
   The 64-year-old McDermott, a member of the state's highest court
since January 1982, sued on grounds the articles titled ``Above the
Law'' implied he fixed cases.
   The articles were published in May 1983 and reprinted in 1984 to
distribute to journalism and law schools.
   The reprints, sub-headed ``the questionable conduct of the
Supreme Court,'' claimed many of the justices ignored the
Pennsylvania Code of Judicial Ethics, which the court adopted in
1974.
   The articles suggested McDermott shouldn't have participated in
two cases involving lawyers from the Dilworth, Paxson, Kalish &amp;
Kauffman firm, which had been the largest contributor to his 1981
election, because it was a conflict of interest.
   The articles noted McDermott accepted $6,100 from the
Philadelphia law firm, that one of the firm's lawyers had arranged
a 1981 trip to the Pennsylvania coal region, and three months after
the justice took his seat on the court he voted favorably for
Dilworth clients.
   In asking the jury to find in favor of the newspaper, Hangley
declared, ``We say that Justice McDermott did something wrong; that
he didn't abide by the Pennsylvania Code of Judicial Conduct.''
   ``Did we say he committed a crime? No. Has he fixed a case?
No,'' Hangley said. ``But he did ignore the code that says he
shouldn't have participated in cases where his partiality is
questioned.''
   McDermott's lawyer, James Beasley, argued that accusing the
justice ``of being partial, that's accusing him of a crime.''
   Besides the two cases involving Dilworth lawyers, McDermott also
claimed he was defamed when the newspaper implied he had improperly
used his judicial influence to get his son a job in the
Philadelphia district attorney's office. The son still works for
the prosecutor.
   Biddle testified his stories were fair, truthful and accurate,
and insisted that what he wrote concerned the official actions, not
only of McDermott, but of all justices.
   Only McDermott sued.
   ``The Code of Judicial Conduct, which I researched and used in
my story, says in Pennsylvania a judge should not participate where
his partiality might reasonably be questioned,'' Biddle testified.
``To act against that code ... is to engage in misconduct.''
   While McDermott acknowledged that the reported facts were
substantially true he insisted the inferences and innuendos they
raised, and the way paragraphs were positioned in the paper, left
the impression he was dishonest.
   He had demanded a retraction before he sued.
   ``All I wanted was for them to say that I was an honest man, and
not corrupt,'' he testified. ``If they had done it, we wouldn't
have to spend all this time and all this money, and be in this
courtroom.''
   The justice said that ``never, ever'' did he have financial
ties, receive any personal gifts or have any conflicts of interest
with anyone involved in cases before the Supreme Court.

   World trade negotiations collapsed
Friday when the United States and the European Community refused to
back down and end a bitter dispute over reductions in farm
subsidies.
   ``They must both have glass eyes because no one blinked,''
Canada's trade minister, John Crosbie, said after bargaining was
suspended in the 107-nation negotiations, the most comprehensive
trade talks ever.
   Uruguay's foreign minister, Hector Gros Espiell, halted five
days of discussions after the EC rejected a compromise requiring
deeper cuts in its extensive farm support program.
   Gros Espiell promised to restart the talks, possibly next month
in Geneva, after further consultations to try to resolve the
contentious farm issue.
   But no one seemed in a hurry to get together again.
   ``When it is clear that a basis exists for successfully
concluding the round, the United States will return to the
negotiating table,'' said U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills.
   ``We need this cooling-off period to get a full evaluation of
the situation,'' said India's commerce minister, Subramanian Swamy.
   President Bush, who was in Caracas, Venezuela, said late Friday
the United States ``remains committed'' to completing the trade
talks.
   ``Accordingly, it is our hope that participants, especially the
EC, will take this opportunity to reflect upon their position on
agriculture and develop the political will to negotiate real
market-opening agreements while there is still time to do so,''
said Bush.
   The suspension occurred in what was supposed to be the final
week of bargaining in the Uruguay Round, the negotiations begun in
1986 in the South American country.
   The talks were designed to overhaul the world trading system by
rewriting the rules and lowering barriers to trade in 15 areas,
including textiles, agriculture, manufactured goods and services
such as banking, telecommunications and construction.
   Success, officials have said, will give an enormous boost to the
world economy well into the 21st century.
   The agriculture fight attracted the most attention during the
bargaining because the United States and others have insisted they
won't budge on other areas without a deal on farm subsidies.
   The United States, backed by Australia, Argentina, Uruguay and
others, insisted the community slash such assistance by 75 percent
to 90 percent, with the deepest cuts in export subsidies.
   The EC refused, contending that hefty slashes would force some
of its 10 million farmers off the land. Its original offer called
only for a 30 percent cut in limited areas.
   Each side blamed the other for the failure.
   The community said the United States put too much attention on
agriculture and was unwilling to negotiate in all other areas under
consideration.
   ``We were prepared to continue negotiations ... We didn't walk
out of the room,'' said Frans Andriessen, the community's top trade
official.
   ``Unless and until they (the Americans) reduce their
expectations ... there will not be progress on agriculture,'' said
Ray MacSharry, the community's hard-line agriculture chief.
   Mrs. Hills and Clayton Yeutter, the American agriculture
secretary, said it was up to the Europeans.
   ``The question is whether the community is out of step or
whether the rest of the world is out of step,'' Yeutter told a news
conference.
   The collapse was disappointing to developing nations, which
would like to use the talks to pry open more markets in the rich
countries for their products.
   Mexican Trade Secretary Jaime Serra, who presided over the
negotiations on services, predicted a deal could have been struck
had the officials won agreement on agriculture.
   The negotations are sponsored by the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, which was set up in 1947 as a forum and an
agreement for promoting freer world trade.

<HEAD>Metzenbaum Takes Aim At Gasoline Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIRK BEVERIDGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of Big Oil's persistent critics, Sen. Howard
M. Metzenbaum, lashed out at high gasoline prices Friday, demanding
an explanation from a dozen major oil companies.
   ``Leaders of the oil industry in the United States owe the
American people an answer - if not a refund or a discount,'' the
Ohio Democrat said in a letter sent to Exxon Corp. Chairman
Lawrence G. Rawl and the heads of 11 other oil giants. ``They
cannot understand this situation and neither can we in Congress.''
   Metzenbaum said that if oil companies do not start cutting
gasoline prices immediately, he will look into the possibility of
holding congressional hearings into their pricing policies.
   Metzenbaum said he was outraged to see that gasoline prices have
stayed at high levels in recent weeks, even though crude oil prices
have come down about $15 per barrel from the highs they hit during
October.
   This week, the futures price of unleaded gasoline fell to within
a penny of the price it commanded the day before Iraq invaded
Kuwait, yet the American Automobile Association reported that
gasoline prices at the pump were within a penny of the highest
price it has ever recorded.
   ``Why is it that gasoline prices go up instantly when crude oil
costs go up, but when crude oil costs come down, your gasoline
prices do not?'' Metzenbaum asked the oil executives.
   The major oil companies say they do not control pricing, which
is set by local service stations and eventually finds its
appropriate levels through supply and demand.
   Exxon spokesman Bill Smith in Dallas said he had no immediate
response to the letter Metzenbaum sent to Rawl.
   Metzenbaum said in a telephone interview Friday evening that he
does not have high hopes for getting any kind of answer from the
oil companies that he would consider satisfactory.
   ``Of all the industries in America, there are probably few,
maybe with the exception of the tobacco industry, that has less a
sense of community responsbility than the oil industry,'' the
senator said.
   The industry, for its part, has characterized Metzenbaum as a
demagogue.
   The senator's letters also went out to Shell Oil Co., Mobil
Corp., BP America Inc., Texaco Inc., Chevron Corp., Amoco Corp.,
Marathon Oil Co., Atlantic Richfield Co., Phillips Petroleum Co.,
Unocal Corp. and Sun Co.

<HEAD>Hit Six-Month Highs on Grim Economic News, Lower Interest Rates</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices recorded the biggest one-day jump in
more than six months on Friday, propelled by grim employment
figures and clear signs that the Federal Reserve moved to ease
interest rates.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond leaped 1} point, or
$17.50 per $1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which falls when
prices rise, plunged to 8.18 percent from 8.33 percent late
Thursday.
   The sharp price rise in the long-term bond was the largest since
June 1, when 30-year prices soared 1 27-32 points on a monthly
government report showing a big increase in unemployment. Back
then, yields on the 30-year bond dropped to 8.44 percent from the
previous day's close of 8.57 percent.
   This time around economists were expecting bad tidings in
Friday's monthly report, but the news was worse than expected.
   The nation's unemployment rate shot up to a three-year high of
5.9 percent in November, creating the worst two-month loss since
the depths of the 1981-82 recession, the Labor Department said.
   Over five months, the number of jobless has swelled by900,000.
Nearly all of the nation's industries lost jobs last month as
payrolls fell by 267,000.
   ``Everybody was shocked. People got a touch spooked and said,
`the Fed is going to ease on this,''' said Mike Casey,
international economist at Maria Ramirez Capital Consultants in New
York.
   The market jumped on speculation that the Fed would ease
interest rates to stimulate the economy, a move that generally
gives a lift to bond prices.
   Suspicions seemed confirmed around midday as word among traders
spread that the central bank allowed the federal funds rate, the
rate banks charge each other on overnight loans, to drift down by a
quarter of a percentage point to 7\ percent.
   In addition, the central bank announced it would inject money
into the banking system to encourage banks to make more funds
available.
   By the day's close the federal funds rate traded at 7 1-16
percent, down from 7 7-16 percent late Thursday.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, short-term
maturities rose 5-16 point to 17-32 point, intermediate maturities
jumped 11-16 point to 1 point and long-term issues soared 1{ point
to 113-16 point, the Telerate Inc. financial information service
reported.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures
price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities
of a year or longer, was up 8.56 to 1,186.95.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.10 percent as the
discount was down 11 basis points to 6.89 percent. Yields on
six-month bills were down to 7.08 percent as the discount fell 12
basis points to 6.76 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 7.11
percent as the discount was down 12 basis points to 6.68 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds rose 1-16 point to 91 23-32. The average
yield to maturity fell to 7.47 percent from 7.48 percent late
Thursday.

   A company making $30 million in chemical
protection suits for the government has lost half of the contract
because it's way behind on deliveries, a Defense Department
spokesman said Friday.
   Sac and Fox Industries was to have delivered 245,515 suits by
now, but has only sent 13,350, said Frank Johnson, a spokesman for
the defense Personnel Support Center in Philadelphia.
   ``That is the reason for the partial termination,'' Johnson said
in a telephone interview. ``We've already modified two delivery
schedules. They were still way behind.''
   Johnson said Sac and Fox now is under contract to make 204,595
suits, down from 490,915 suits in the original contract signed in
March 1989.
   Attempts to reach Sac and Fox president James Branum were
unsuccessful Friday.
   Johnson said the bulk of the problems were with slow delivery of
the chemical suits, which have been in demand since Iraq invaded
Kuwait four months ago. The suits would be used to guard U.S.
troops against chemical warfare.
   Johnson also said some suits did not meet government standards.
   Bruce Willingham, a company director, attributed part of the
problem to the rising cost of raw materials, which increased
following the invasion.
   ``Prices soared for raw materials, and so did the material
suppliers, who changed the way they operated their credit,'' he
said Friday.
   Sac and Fox officials have said the government would not
reimburse them for the suits until they pass inspection, creating
some cash flow problems and trouble paying employees.
   The company has plants at four locations in Oklahoma.
   Terri White, a spokeswoman in the Defense Personnel Support
Center, said the government has extended various delivery dates for
Sac and Fox for the remainder of the contract.

   The worst two-month stretch of layoffs since
the 1981-82 recession pushed civilian unemployment to a three-year
high of 5.9 percent in November, the government said.
   Payrolls fell by 267,000 last month, the Labor Department said
Friday, after a 180,000-job loss in October. Since June, when the
unemployment rate was 5.2 percent, nearly 1 million Americans have
joined the ranks of the unemployed.
   Following the grim news, the Federal Reserve and a handful of
banks moved to cut interest rates.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Growth in consumer credit slowed to a
seasonally adjusted $1.47 billion in October, the government
reported. Analysts said it was another sign of a weakening economy.
   The Federal Reserve on Friday said consumer credit grew at an
annual rate of 2.4 percent, down from a revised 4.6 percent rate
posted in September. The September rate was even slower than the
4.9 percent advance originally reported.
   Revolving, or credit card, debt increased $1.56 billion, or an
annual rate of 8.6 percent, down from a 12.9 percent gain in
September and a 13.3 percent advance a month earlier.

   DETROIT (AP) - More than 30,000 auto workers, nearly all of them

industry wrestles with a recession.
   GM, Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. said Friday they plan to
shut down all or parts of a dozen assembly plants for the week of
Dec. 10, keeping 32,380 workers at home. The closures stem from
slow dealer orders.
   GM also said it will lay off 50,470 workers when it shuts down
18 assembly factories in 14 states the week of Dec. 17, the last
week before the industry's traditional shutdown between the

   NEW YORK (AP) - R.H. Macy Co. Inc. said it lost $56.5 million

weakening economy and the Middle East crisis, tumbled nearly 10
percent.
   The closely held Macy, which is still paying the costs of a 1986
leveraged buyout, said its loss in the quarter ended Oct. 27
translated to $38.53 per share and compared with a shortfall of
$33.1 million, or $23.92 per share, in the same period a year
earlier.
   Macy's results in the latest quarter, reported Friday, reflected
a $10.2 million gain related to a repurchase of some of the
retailer's bonds.

   PRVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) - Fleet-Norstar Financial Group plans to
cut about 500 jobs by the end of the month in an austerity plan
designed to save about $100 million next year, a company official
said.
   The layoffs will be scattered among Fleet's 1,000 offices in 40
states, but will affect primarily workers in New England and New
York, said bank spokesman Robert W. Lougee Jr on Friday
   The Providence-based bank holding company pinned most of the
layoffs on the recession plaguing the Northeast.

   CINCINNATI (AP) - Kroger Co. says it has received so few
responses in a bond-exchange program to reduce its $1.4 billion
bond debt that it will extend the deadline for replies until Dec.
20.
   The program was to have ended on Tuesday.
   The grocery giant offered Nov. 5 to let holders of bonds that
begin paying 15.5 percent annual interest in October 1993 trade
them in for bonds that pay 13 percent immediately.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole says he will
introduce a bill early next month to grant some tax relief for
military personnel serving in the Persian Gulf area.
   His bill would waive interest charges for failing to pay any
taxes due by the April 15 deadline.
   The Kansas senator made the announcement Friday after the
Internal Revenue Service noted that any member of the armed
services serving in the Persian Gulf on April 15 would
automatically have an additional 60 days to file a return and pay
any tax due.

   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - World trade negotiations collapsed when
the United States and the European Community refused to back down
and end a bitter dispute over reductions in farm subsidies.
   Uruguay's foreign minister, Hector Gros Espiell, halted five
days of discussions on Friday after the EC rejected a compromise
requiring deeper cuts in its extensive farm support program.
   Gros Espiell promised to restart the talks, possibly next month
in Geneva, after further consultations to try to resolve the
contentious farm issue.

<HEAD>NCR Chairman Says Company Not For Sale Despite Board Setting Price</HEAD>

   NCR Corp. Chairman Charles Exley Jr. said
Friday his company has no plans to sell itself to AT&amp;T despite the
fact his board of directors set a minimum price.
   Exley said his board set the $125-per-share minimum because it
felt obligated to its shareholders to set a ``full-value'' price.
He said NCR would fight any takeover by AT&amp;T if that price isn't
met.
   ``In the name of rationality and in recognition of its fiduciary
responsibility to NCR shareholders, the board felt obligated to set
a `full value' price for shares,'' he said in a statement. ``It
would be preposterous for us to say there is no price we would
accept.''
   However, Exley repeated his vow to keep NCR independent.
   ``The fact that the board set a price does not mean that we want
to sell the company - the company is not for sale,'' he said.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. launced a $90-a-share cash
tender offer to NCR shareholders Thursday. On Wednesday, NCR's
board rejected a takeover bid of $90 a share in AT&amp;T stock, or a
total of about $6.1 billion.
   NCR directors said Wednesday in their rejection that they would
enter into discussions with AT&amp;T over a merger if it increased the
bid to $125 a share, or a total of about $8.5 billion. AT&amp;T
rejected the amount as ``outrageous.''
   Exley said NCR would provide AT&amp;T with non-public information
about his company's finances that would justify the higher offer if
AT&amp;T would sign a confidentiality agreement and an agreement to
halt further steps toward a takeover.
   Also Friday, AT&amp;T said it would withdraw a request it filed in
U.S. District Court in Columbus seeking a temporary restraining
order against enforcement of the Ohio Takeover Act.
   The law sets out procedures to be followed and information
disclosed in tender offers.
   Thomas B. Ridgley, a Columbus lawyer representing AT&amp;T, told
Judge James L. Graham the company would drop its motion as a result
of an order issued by the Ohio Division of Securities.
   The order confirmed that the agency, based on documents provided
by AT&amp;T, would not suspend the company's bid for shares of NCR.
   AT&amp;T's request for a restraining order was part of a lawsuit
filed Thursday contending federal instead of state law should
prevail in its bid for NCR. Although the request for expedited
action was dropped, the suit is pending.
   The phone company says it wants to buy NCR, the nation's
fifth-largest computer company, to bolster its own money-losing
computer line.
