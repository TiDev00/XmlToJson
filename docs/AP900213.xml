   Three robbers burst into a fast-food
restaurant, tied up the manager and attempted to flee with
thousands of dollars, but were cut down and killed in a fusillade
of police gunfire Monday, authorities said.
   A fourth person involved in the robbery at a McDonald's
restaurant was wounded, said police Lt. Fred Nixon. None of the
victims was immediately identified, but Nixon said the survivor was
in serious condition at a Los Angeles hospital.
   Nine officers from the Police Department's special
investigations section watched the robbery taking place around 2
a.m., and approached the men after they got into a getaway car,
authorities said.
   The officers opened fire when one of the four raised what looked
like a handgun and pointed it at them, said police Lt. Bill Hall,
who heads the team that investigates shootings involving police.
   ``... All officers fired almost simultaneously,'' said Hall.
   The gun turned out to be a pellet gun, but to police it looked
real, he said. ``I don't think you'd be likely to know the
difference if you were looking down the barrel of one,'' Hall said.
   Officers recovered masks and several thousand dollars in cash
from the car, Hall said.
   Police had been following the four, some of whom were believed
involved in earlier restaurant robberies, said Officer Bill Frio.
   ``We had a couple of possible suspects identified, but not
enough evidence to arrest and book them, so we were tailing them,''
he said.
   The four were followed from the beachfront community of Venice
to Sun Valley, about 15 miles north of downtown, where Hall said
officers watched them enter the closed restaurant.
   ``There was a female manager inside, alone, and the doors were
all locked,'' said Hall. ``The suspects forced open a side door,
tied her up and forced her to provide the combination of the safe.''
   Hall said the manager called police when she saw the men
approaching her restaurant, but it was decided to make the arrest
afterward rather than interrupt the robbery because there had been
no injuries in previous restaurant holdups.

   The Associated Press has named a new executive
photo editor and a presidential assistant to coordinate its
recently announced electronic darkroom-PhotoStream project.
   President Louis D. Boccardi said Vincent J. Alabiso will become
executive photo editor of the news cooperative and Harold G. Buell
will be assistant to the president for electronic darkrooms and
PhotoStream.
   Alabiso, director of photography for The Boston Globe and a
former New England photo editor in the AP's Boston bureau, succeeds
Buell, who has directed AP photo operations since 1968.
   The appointments, announced Monday, are effective March 19.
   The AP announced last month that it will be installing
electronic darkrooms at its 950 LaserPhoto members. These darkrooms
will provide newspapers with AP's high-speed digital PhotoStream
system that will enable them to receive an AP black and white photo
in less than a minute and a color photo in three minutes.
   ``Hal Buell has contributed enormously to the growth of our
photo service, which now reaches 950 newspapers in the United
States alone. I have asked him to bring that experience to the
implementation of our PhotoStream and darkroom projects which are
the most exciting steps we have taken in photos in recent
history,'' Boccardi said.
   ``And in Vin Alabiso we bring back to the AP an outstanding
photo editor who has now seen what we do from the newspaper's
perspective.
   ``These moves, supported by the outstanding photo team we have
in place, position us for the exciting years that lie ahead in the
world of high-speed, high-quality news photography.''
   Buell, 58, who has a master's degree from the Medill School of
Journalism at Northwestern University, which he also attended as an
undergraduate, has been in the photo department since 1957. He was
named executive photo editor in 1968, and the title of assistant
general manager was added in 1977.
   He has been instrumental in the concept and development of the
PhotoStream system.
   Alabiso, 43, has been director of photography at the Globe since
January 1987. A 1969 graduate from Northeastern University in
Boston, Alabiso joined the AP in New York in 1975 and left the
following year.
   He rejoined the AP in Boston in 1981 as photo editor and was
named New England Newsphoto editor in 1983 before leaving in 1986
to join the Globe.

   Oh, St. Valentine! How to capture the rapture? Does confection
affirm affection? Do flowers floor? Or will it take a gold mine to
get you to be mine?
   Valentine's Day _ colored rose red, punctuated with arrows from
Cupid's bow, sweet as a bon bon and pretty as a bouquet _ actually
has its roots in blood, gore, guts and gluttony.
   Historians say Valentine's Day began in the third century, when
two Christian saints, both named Valentine, were executed. Because
the martyrs' feast day, Feb. 14, was around the time of a pagan
Roman festival called the Lupercalia, which celebrated fertility,
St. Valentine was popularly designated the patron saint of lovers.
   It's been 1,720 years since the heathens had their way _ today,
we shower oursweeties with perfume, jewelry, lingerie, candy and
flowers.
   We'll also buy them pajamas, stuffed animals in all shapes,
acrylic legs filled with German chocolate _ at $98 a limb at Macy's
_ and Vietnamese potbellied pigs.
   Americans will give their Valentines $611 million worth of candy
this year, about $2.50 in sweets for every man, woman and child,
says Richard O'Connell, president of the National Confectioners
Association.
   If that $611 million were translated into chocolate kisses at
the New York City price of $5 a pound, about 93 kisses, it would
buy 122.2 million pounds. If all those kisses were laid end to end,
the chain of chocolate would circle the globe 6.4 times.
   If you don't want to make your baby a blimp, merchants have a
few suggestions.
   Bloomingdale's has some ``really fun boxer shorts with hearts on
them,'' said spokeswoman Jennifer Conner. They also have T-shirts
with ``big red lips'' on them. The apparel will set you back about
$20.
   Victoria's Secret, the mildly racy lingerie chain, offers
toiletries for those who don't feel their relationships are up to
intimate underthings.
   But business is still brisk in undies, said spokeswoman Laura
Holbrook. ``Oversized satin T-shirts, silk camisoles and pants in
rich gem colors like emerald, ruby, sapphire will be big,'' she
said.
   A little more upscale, Bergdorf Goodman has red silk pajamas for
$375, a matching robe for $375 and bath oil for $63 _ a mere $813
to get your sweetheart clean and ready for bed.
   Macy's Estate Jewelry department offers atomizers with
cranberry-colored glass and sterling silver trim for $950.
   Always popular is the romantic staple _ a simple red rose.
Seventy million roses will be sold for Valentine's Day, the biggest
day of the year for rose sales, the Society of American Florists
predicts. Eighty percent will be red, the rest mostly pink and
yellow.
   The other Valentine tradition _ exchanging cards _ is booming,
said Leslee Parsons, a spokeswoman for the American Greeting Corp.
They expect more than 1 billion valentines to be given this year.
School children give the most cards, she said.
   But back to the chocolate. The National Confectioner's
Association says Americans' increasing health consciousness is
actually boosting the industry.
   ``Americans are treating themselves to confections and sweets,
but because they are more health conscious and working out, they
don't feel as guilty,'' said spokesman Brian Muloney. ``In fact,
there's more working out and pigging out.''
   And there are some who will literally pig out.
   Paradise Pigs, which sells the latest trendy pet, Vietnamese
potbellied pigs, says it has received orders for Valentine's Day
pigs, which cost from $1,500 to $2,500 for males and about $5,000
for females.
   The pigs are prized because they stay small, ranging from 25
pounds to 150 pounds, and have sunny dispositions.
   ``For a lot of our customers, it's like having a kid,'' said
Paradise Pig's owner, Kris Bryant. ``Husbands are buying them for
their wives, men are buying them for their girlfriends.''
   Bryant said her pigs try to knock the phone from her hand when
they think she's been talking long enough; that might make them a
good buy for parents of teen-agers.
   Be it a dozen roses or a porcine bundle of joy, most people will
wonder about their Valentine's Day gift: Was it given sincerely or
was it just an obligatory gesture?
   ``People spend a good deal of time wondering if a gift is
sincere,'' said sociologist Hy Mariampolski. And givers also worry
whether their presents will be enjoyed, he said.
   ``People are very insecure about gifts being appreciated so they
fall into patterns of safe gift giving,'' said Mariampolski, who
studies gift-giving habits for QualiData Research Inc. in New York.
One way to make sure your gift is well-regarded is to personalize
it, he said.
   ``It may be a bouquet of flowers,'' he said, ``but if a guy has
it delivered to his girlfriend's doorstep by a strolling musician,
it's going to be very special.''

<HEAD>Participants Recalls The Trial That Changed South African History</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In his first speech after
leaving prison, Nelson Mandela repeated the most famous section of
his last previous speech _ his statement from the dock at the 1964
Rivonia trial.
   It was a striking reminder of the importance of that trial,
which resulted in life prison sentences for the core of the African
National Congress' leadership.
   The trial took its name from the area near Johannesburg where
Mandela's ANC colleagues were arrested in a police raid on a
farmhouse used as a secret headquarters for the guerrilla movement.
   Mandela, already jailed for two years for his covert activities,
and 10 other men went on trial, charged with sabotage and
conspiring to overthrow the government. They faced possible
execution if convicted.
   ``There was a very real fear of the death penalty,'' Arthur
Chaskalson, one of the defense attorneys, said in an interview.
``Not until the last day were we sure it wouldn't be imposed.''
   Several of the defendants, including Mandela, decided not to
contest the sabotage charges. They contended the ANC's use of
violence was a necessary last resort after the government rejected
non-violent protest campaigns.
   Despite these admissions, the state summoned a parade of
witnesses to bolster its case, including guerrillas-turned-infomers
identifed as Mr. X and Mr. Y.
   Most witnesses ``lied shamelessly, purposefully and apparently
to order,'' wrote Joel Joffe, another defense lawyer, in an
unpublished account of the trial. He said most of the witnesses
were held for long periods in solitary confinement and subjected to
duress.
   Presiding in the high-ceilinged main chamber of Pretoria Supreme
Court was Justice Quartus de Wet, described by Joffe as
``politically independent, but arrogant, prejudiced, tempermental.''
   ``He was unquestionably sensitive to the needs of the white
society which he believed in and upheld, and also of the
government... He acted out their role, I think, unconsciously,''
Joffe wrote.
   Joffe later moved to Britain, where he became a businessman and
a trustee of Oxfam, a private relief agency. Chaskalson and George
Bizos, another member of the defense team, are among South Africa's
most prominent civil rights lawyers.
   The head of their team, Bram Fischer, was arrested in September
1964, five months after the trial ended, on charges of membership
in the outlawed Communist Party. He went underground while on bail,
was caught in November 1965 and sentenced to life imprisonment.
   Stricken with cancer, he was allowed to move to a brother's home
under house arrest, and died soon afterwards, in May 1975.
Chaskalson said prison authorities took Fischer's ashes after he
was cremated and never returned them to relatives.
   The prosecuter was Percy Yutar, described by Joffe as fond of
``bogus hysteria and fake dramatics.''
   Yutar is still a practicing lawyer, but he refused to comment on
the trial or Mandela's release.
   ``I'm not a politician, I'm a legal man,'' Yutar said. ``I don't
discuss cases I have prosecuted.''
   During the trial, Yutar scoffed at the ANC's assertion that it
represented the wishes of the black majority.
   ``The deceit of the accused is amazing... They took it on
themselves to tell the world that the Africans in South Africa are
suppressed, oppressed and depressed,'' Yutar said. ``It is a great
pity that the rank and file of the Bantu (blacks) in the country,
who are peaceful, law-abiding, faithful and loyal, should have been
duped by false promises.''
   On April 20, 1964, Mandela entered the dock to explain why the
ANC took up arms in pursuit of freedom. On Sunday, before tens of
thousands of supporters in Cape Town, Mandela ended the first
speech of his newfound freedom with the same words he used to
conclude in Pretoria.
   ``During my lifetime, I have dedicated myself to this struggle
of the African people. I have fought against white domination and I
have fought against black domination,'' he said.
   ``I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in
which all persons live together in harmony and with equal
opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and achieve,
but, my Lord, if needs be, an ideal for which I am prepared to
die.''
   During the five-hour statement, recalled Joffe, ``the silence
became more and more profound, until it seemed that no one in the
court dared move or breathe.''
   On June 12, 1964, Mandela and seven co-defendants were sentenced
by de Wet to life in prison. He said sparing them from the gallows
was the only leniency he could show.
   The defense lawyers, who had become close friends with the
accused, felt both sadness and satisfaction.
   ``We'd done all we could,'' said Chaskalson. ``These were the
leaders of the apartheid resistance. They conducted themselves with
tremendous dignity _ they stated their cases so well, about why
they went into revolt against the state.''
   The only white man among those convicted, Dennis Goldberg, was
freed in 1985 after he agreed to renounce violence. The others,
except for Mandela, were freed unconditionally last October.
   De Wet is dead, as are Prime Minister Hendrik Verwoerd and
Justice Minister B.J. Voster, who oversaw the police attempt to
smash the ANC. All the convicted defendants are alive, the oldest
being 80-year-old Govan Mbeki.
   Could it be said that, in some way, the defendants won the case,
Chaskalson was asked.
   ``They certainly didn't lose,'' he replied. ``They had the moral
high ground.''

   The identity of the first St. Valentine is about as mysterious
as love itself.
   Historians say Valentine's Day has its origins in the third
century, when two Christian martyrs, both named Valentine, were
executed. A pagan festival to fertility, called the Lupercalia, was
still being celebrated at that time, and because it fell around the
martyrs' Feb. 14 feast day, St. Valentine became the protector of
lovers.
   The people of Terni, Italy, a steel-making town between Rome and
Perugia, insist their St. Valentine was the one who started the
annual day of love. The town's patron saint was beheaded Feb. 14 in
the year 270, after having been imprisoned and whipped.
   Legend has it that Valentine had a garden where he let children
play and lovers meet. While imprisoned, Valentine tied the keys of
the garden gate to two pigeons with a message inviting the children
to return to the garden.
   A version of the Terni story has Valentine, in his 76 years as
bishop, giving lovers flowers from the garden. One couple who
encountered the bishop enjoyed such a happy marriage that every
couple wanted his blessing.
   The story is complicated by a second St. Valentine, also
beheaded in the third century, in Rome, and who also has a feast
day Feb. 14.
   But ``Valentine 2'' may not have been a saint at all. Some
scholars say a church built on Rome's Via Flaminia by a man named
Valentine somehow became known as St. Valentine's church, starting
a legend about a non-existent saint.
   The Roman Catholic Church takes a neutral stance and designates
no patron saint of lovers. The Vatican Congregation for the Causes
of Saints says 17 Valentines are listed in the official
encyclopedia of saints, including ones from Italy, France, Spain
and Germany.
   Terni's bishop, Franco Gualdrini, also refuses to claim his
town's saint as the definitive champion of love.
   ``It is a popular tradition,'' Gualdrini once said of the
adulation St. Valentine now receives. ``Some things are proclaimed
from above, some are proclaimed from below.''

   When Nelson Mandela walks the
streets of Johannesburg after 27 years in prison, he will see signs
of dramatic change in the apartheid system. He will also see stark
reminders of what has not changed.
   Mandela will see blacks in jobs and areas where they would have
been banned a few years ago by apartheid laws enforcing segregation
of the country's races. But he will still be banned from living in
white areas, his grandchildren will be banned from white schools
and he and his family will still be registered as blacks with no
political rights.
   ``The black majority _ three quarters of the population _ still
has no parliamentary vote and Pretoria shows no sign of getting rid
of its ideological cornerstones,'' The Sowetan newspaper commented.
   Apartheid, the legal segregation of South Africa's whites,
blacks, Asians and mixed-race people, still survives in many forms
despite efforts by President F.W. de Klerk's to ease the system.
The government says it has no immediate plans to abolish apartheid
laws segregating residential areas and classifying people by race.
   Mandela said after leaving prison Sunday that South Africa could
never have peace until all vestiges of apartheid were destroyed.
``Apartheid's destruction on our subcontinent is incalculable. The
fabric of family life of millions of my people has been
shattered,'' he said.
   De Klerk freed Mandela on Feb. 11 after legalizing the African
National Congress and other anti-apartheid groups to try and clear
the way for talks with the black majority on ending white rule and
sharing political power.
   Johannesburg and other big cities have seen major changes in
recent years as some apartheid laws have been repealed or are just
ignored. Central areas of Johannesburg, once dominated by whites,
are increasingly black and restaurants, shops, cinemas and other
facilites are open to all races.
   Many aspects of so-called ``petty apartheid,'' such as separate
public toilets, park benches and segregated restaurants, have
disappeared. Some major apartheid laws have been abolished,
including regulations requiring blacks to have passes to enter
white areas and racial restrictions on jobs.
   Also gone are ``morality laws'' that imposed prison sentences on
people of different races who married or had sex. It is a striking
change from the days when all blacks were expected to address
whites as ``boss.''
   But the changes in Johannesburg and other relatively liberal
cities have not been matched in many smaller towns and rural
districts where many people live. Many blacks living around Victor
Verster prison outside Cape Town where Mandela was held still call
whites ``master'' or ``boss.''
   When Mandela was jailed in 1962 the apartheid system segregating
whites and blacks was approaching its peak. The white government
said blacks could never be more than laborers and the racial
superiority of whites was the de facto creed of the country.
   Hendrik Verwoerd, a former prime minister who did much to design
and build apartheid, said during a 1954 Senate debate on black
education: ``There is no place for him (blacks) above the level of
certain forms of labor ... What is the use of teaching a Bantu
(black) child mathematics when it cannot use it in practice.''
   Hundreds of thousands of blacks were forcibly relocated from
towns or good farmland to barren country areas to make room for
whites.
   A typical schoolbook for white children taught that blacks were
inferior. ``The white stands on a much higher plane of civilization
and is more developed. Whites must so live, learn and work that we
shall not sink to the cultural level of the non-white,'' it said.
   While de Klerk says he is committed to ending white-minority
rule, he says it must not be replaced by ``black domination.'' The
government has indicated it wants ``group rights'' or special
status for whites in any deal with blacks.
   Mandela and other black leaders say only equal rights can ensure
the rights of all South Africans and group rights would just be
another form of apartheid.
   ``Today, the majority of South Africans, black and white,
recognize that apartheid has no future. It has to be ended by our
own decisive mass action in order to build peace and security,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   Moviegoers found ``Hard to Kill'' easy to watch
as the action-adventure film starring martial arts expert Steven
Seagal chopped its way to the top of the box office with a $9.2
million opening last weekend.
   The story of a Los Angeles detective who wakes up from a
seven-year coma and avenges his family's murder debuted
impressively despite apparently being held in low regard by its
studio and star.
   Warner Bros. failed to screen the film for critics, and even
Seagal has badmouthed it repeatedly. The film collected $7,082 per
screen to lead the top 10, Exhibitor Relations Co. said Monday.
   Cruising along in second place was ``Driving Miss Daisy,''
featuring Jessica Tandy and Morgan Freeman in a comedy about a
Southern widow and her black chaffeur. The film grossed $6.5
million.
   Disney's remake of ``Stella,'' staring Bette Midler, fell from
first to third with receipts of $3.7 million, followed by the
anti-war saga ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' which slipped 25
percent to fourth place with sales of $3 million.
   The new picture, ``Loose Cannons,'' teaming Gene Hackman and Dan
Aykroyd, came in fifth with $2.2 million.
   ``Stanley &amp; Iris,'' the story of adult illiteracy with Jane
Fonda and Robert De Niro, weakly debuted in sixth with $2.1
million. In seventh was the action-adventure movie ``Tango &amp; Cash''
with $1.8 million.
   The black divorce comedy ``The War of the Roses'' landed in
eighth place on a box-office collection of $1.73 million. The
police thriller ``Internal Affairs'' was ninth with $1.71 million,
and the ensemble drama ``Steel Magnolias'' was 10th on sales of
$1.6 million.
   ``Time of the Gypsies,'' the last Columbia release developed by
ousted studio head David Puttnam, opened on two screens with a very
average haul of $23,476. The film has to be dubbed in every movie
house in the world because the dialogue is composed in an extinct
gypsy language.
   Here are the top movie ticket sales for Friday through Monday as
tallied by Exhibitor Relations.
   Figures are based on a combination of actual box-office receipts
and studio projections where actual figures are not immediately
available.
   1. ``Hard to Kill,'' Warner Bros., $9.2 million (weekend gross),
1,301 screens, $7,082 per screen, $9.2 million (total gross), one
week in review.
   2. ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' Tri-Star, $6.5 million, 1,302
screens, $4,988 per screen, $32.9 million, nine weeks.
   3. ``Stella,'' Disney, $3.7 million, 1,213 screens, $3,010 per
screen, $9.3 million, two weeks.
   4. ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' Universal, $3 million, 1,295
screens, $2,320 per screen, $48.4 million, eight weeks.
   5. ``Loose Cannons,'' Tri-Star, $2.2 million, 1,214 screens,
$1,845 per screen, $2.2 million, one week.
   6. ``Stanley &amp; Iris,'' MGM-UA, $2.1 million, 907 screens, $2,318
per screen, $2.1 million, one week.
   7. ``Tango &amp; Cash,'' Warner Bros., $1.8 million, 1,288 screens,
$1,384 per screen, $56.2 million, eight weeks.
   8. ``The War of the Roses,'' 20th Century Fox, $1.73 million,
1,054 screens, $1,643 per screen, $77.5 million, 10 weeks.
   9. ``Internal Affairs,'' Paramount, $1.71 million, 983 screens,
$1,743 per screen, $22 million, five weeks.
   10. ``Steel Magnolias,'' Tri-Star, $1.6 million, 1,328 screens,
$1,210 per screen, $69.3 million, 13 weeks.

   The fall of hard-line Communist
governments across Eastern Europe will deprive the PLO and other
Arab groups of weapons and training.
   Until recently, Romania, Czechoslovakia, East Germany and Poland
provided varying degrees of material and political support to the
PLO and other groups. The aid has now been halted or reduced.
   ``These countries provided training, weapons, served as host
facilities for terrorist organizations and sometimes provided
sabotage materials,'' said Mark Heller, an analyst at Tel Aviv
University's Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies in Israel.
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if that activity stopped completely,''
he added.
   Poland, under the new government of Premier Tadeusz Mazowiecki,
last year withdrew a small stipend it gave to the PLO's diplomatic
mission in Warsaw.
   Czechoslovakia used to export $540 million worth of arms a year
_ some of it to the Middle East _ but will halt all weapons exports
when present agreements expire, Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier
says.
   Polish officials say Warsaw intends to treat every Arab country
equally and that ideology has been eliminated as a factor in Polish
foreign relations.
   Krzysztof Plominski, the Foreign Ministry's deputy department
director for Arab and African affairs, last month said Poland
``opposes any form of terrorism.''
   U.S. government sources reported in early 1988 that the
terrorist Abu Nidal had used a Warsaw trading office as a front for
his organization. The office was closed, apparently at request of
the Polish government.
   Czechoslovak and Romanian officials deny any aid to Arab
radicals since their revolutions.
   ``Yes, there was military and training support to what you can
call Libyan terrorists, but all of that has been suspended today,''
a Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry official told The Associated Press.
He spoke on condition his name not be used.
   Czechoslovak officials said training camps for hundreds of
Libyans and other Arab radicals existed in at least one Interior
Ministry school near Kladno, 20 miles west of Prague. They said it
is now closed.
   According to the Israeli Government Press Office, East Germany
also provided training to PLO guerrillas, some of it was at the
Friedrich Engels Academy in Dresden.
   In addition to helping radicals fight, Czechoslovakia and other
countries often supplied material help to Mideast and North African
countries.
   At least $1 billion worth of Czechoslovak machinery and
construction projects were provided to Arab countries, according to
official figures in Prague.
   Romania, which from the late 1970s trained hundreds of PLO
guerrillas at bases in the Black Sea port of Constanta, the
southern town of Calarasi and near Bucharest, said in January it
had abrogated agreements concluded by toppled Communist dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu.
   The Foreign Ministry said without further detail it discovered
secret agreements that violated international law.
   Romania's former counter-intelligence chief, Gen. Ion Pacepa,
who defected to the United States in 1978, said in his book ``Red
Horizons'' that Bucharest gave the PLO arms and hundreds of forged
passports.
   Romania, East Germany and Czechoslovakia all maintained cordial
relations with PLO leader Yasser Arafat and regularly hosted him as
a guest of state. In 1988 the PLO offices in those countries were
elevated to the status of embassies.
   As an indication of how things are changing, Czechoslovakia
resumed diplomatic relations with Israel last week and East Germany
is considering reparations to Jews who suffered in the Holocaust of
World War II.
   West German officials suspect the former East German leadership
allowed Arab terrorists to cross into West Berlin.
   In April 1986, when two U.S. soldiers and a Turkish woman were
killed and 230 people injured in the bombing of a West Berlin
discotheque, West German and U.S. officials said they believed the
attack was planned and executed by the Libyan embassy in East
Berlin.
   Other terrorists acts carried out from East Berlin by Arabs
included the bombing of the German Arab Friendship Society in West
Berlin's Kreuzberg district in March 1986, believed to have been
organized by a Syrian.

   Seated in a Johannesburg television studio a few
feet from an African National Congress leader, Foreign Minister Pik
Botha of South Africa described followers of the black guerrilla
movement as ``my friends.''
   The ANC's Ahmed Kathrada, released a year ago after 26 years in
jail, said nothing really had changed but that he didn't doubt the
sincerity or integrity of the white government leaders.
   His face lined and somber, Jeff Masomola of the smaller,
militant black nationalist Pan African Congress dismissed
negotiations as futile.
   Only immediate universal suffrage for the 5-1 black majority, he
said, ``will result in the taking over of this country by the
people who own it.''
   Veteran white liberal politician Helen Suzman chided Botha for
``making the sort of speeches I made 30 years ago.''
   All were guests on the British Broadcasting Corp.'s ``Panorama''
current affairs program beamed live from Johannesburg in what the
network said was the first such appearance by South African leaders
from across almost the entire political spectrum.
   Only the far-right white opposition Conservative Party refused
to come to the studio because its followers object to sitting in a
room with ANC members.
   Conservative Party spokesman Koos van der Merwe made his
contribution in a separate recording. ``He (Nelson Mandela) came
out of that jail (on Sunday) without having given in one inch of
his demands,'' said van der Merwe. ``They are not interested in
peace or democracy. They want complete capitulation of the white
people.''
   No one raised their voices or interrupted throughout Monday
night's nearly one-hour program.
   Apart from two giant drawings of ANC leader Nelson Mandela in
the background, the atmosphere resembled that of a leisurely late
night talk show about the modern novel.
   In the studio audience, several whites expressed unease or
resentment about the insistence by Mandela, released on Sunday
after 27 years in jail, that the armed struggle should continue.
Some of the blacks wondered why, after decades of apartheid, blacks
were now supposed to help allay white fears.
   But a black businessman suggested blacks and whites should each
imagine how it felt to be the other at this momentous time in their
country's history.
   A white student seated alongside a young black woman with the
ANC colors pinned on her school uniform said he was confident of a
future where race no longer mattered.
   Chief Mangosotho Buthelezi, leader of South Africa's largest
tribe and its Inkhata movement, was equally confident that once
round a negotiating table, South Africans would find a way.
   ``Blacks and whites in this country have become
interdependent,'' said Buthelezi, who rejects ANC violence but
refuses to take independece for his fragmented KwaZulu homeland
under apartheid's now abandoned grand plan of giving the white
minority permanent control.
   Challenged by van der Merwe from offstage to say whether the
government was prepared to yield to ANC demands of universal
suffrage in a unitary state, Botha looked weary.
   ``My government has insisted that whatever constitution is
agreed upon must have majority support,'' said Botha. ``How we are
going to do it will be for the various parties to decide.''
   He paused and added, ``With all respect to my friends in the
ANC, if they think for one moment that some of their policies are
going to be accepted by a majority of South Africans, including
black South Africans, I say to them they are going to be in for a
surprise.''

<DATELINE>HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Waves of grimy crude oil spilled
by a tanker invaded a two-mile stretch of Southern California beach
Monday near a refuge for endangered pelicans and other birds.
   Authorities closed about 10 miles of popular surfing and
sunbathing beaches to the public for at least three weeks because
of the health threat posed by fumes from the oil.
   Cleanup crews dispatched to the fouled Bolsa Chica State Beach
discovered what authorities called the most serious beach pollution
since the spill of an estimated 400,000 gallons Wednesday. The
tanker American Trader apparently punctured itself twice on its own
anchor as it maneuvered near a submerged pipeline about two miles
offshore.
   ``We got hit with more oil overnight than we have in this whole
process,'' said Tony Kozlowski, spokesman for cleanup coordinator
British Petroleum Co. PLC, which chartered the tanker, American
Trader.
   ``It was an unbelievable sight,'' Huntington Beach Mayor Tom
Mays said after a helicopter tour. ``We got hit pretty bad last
night and it's continuing today.''
   Black waves glistening in the sun crashed to shore despite the
efforts of a flotilla of boats working to trap the encroaching goo
with containment booms.
   The oily onslaught is near the inland Bolsa Chica Wetlands, an
ecological reserve that is home to the endangered California brown
pelican as well as a temporary home to thousands of migratory birds
and much marine life.
   At Bolsa Chica, 20 miles south of downtown Los Angeles, the
slick ran along two miles of beach, about 30 feet wide and 2 inches
deep.
   Smaller ribbons of oil 4 feet wide were reported near the
Huntington Beach Pier about 5 miles to the south, the Coast Guard
said.
   Cleanup crews worked along a 20-mile stretch of beach from Bolsa
Chica south to Laguna Beach.
   The cleanup at Bolsa Chica was suspended briefly when workers
began complaining of headaches and nausea from the oily fumes. But
by midday, more than 400 cleanup workers were on the beach,
Kozlowski said.
   ``There is no oil in the estuary,'' said Patrick Moore of the
state Department of Fish and Game. ``But birds are leaving the
wetlands and going to the ocean and bringing the oil back to the
estuary.''
   Seventy-one dead birds _ grebes, gulls, loons and pelicans _
have been found in the area, and another 222 oil-soaked birds were
rescued alive and taken to a treatment center, Moore said.
   On Monday evening, the 811-foot American Tanker dropped anchor
just inside the Long Beach Harbor breakwater after receiving Coast
Guard permission to do so. The move had been delayed until the ship
was declared clean enough to enter the harbor.
   Scuba divers applied temporary patches to two holes in the
punctured hull Sunday, and authorities said the vessel passed
``watertight integrity'' tests.
   One-third of the estimated 400,000 gallons of Alaskan crude
still menaced the coast, the Coast Guard said. Skimmers picked up
23 percent of the spill and 43 percent evaporated or naturally
dissipated.
   City and state beaches from Anaheim Bay south through in
Huntington Beach _ about 10 miles in all _ were closed for an
indefinite period, with a three-week minimum. Authorities cited the
danger of fumes from the oil.
   ``It is of vital importance to keep people off the beaches. The
contaminated birds are frightened by the crowds on the beach and
will not come ashore where they can be safely rescued,'' said
biologist Esther Burkett of Fish and Game.
   U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., viewed the beaches from a
helicopter, then criticized President Bush for telling a news
conference Monday that the spill shouldn't be used to bolster
arguments against offshore oil drilling. Bush said a tanker
accident wasn't an indictment of drilling platform safety.
   ``The president should read the environmental impact statements
by his own Department of the Interior, which point out that the
more drilling platforms that you have, the more tankers you will
need,'' said Cranston.
   On the beach, politicians, environmentalists and celebrities
gathered to demand legislation at the federal and state levels
requiring double hulls for tankers and other safeguards.
   ``It makes no difference what the damn cost is,'' actor James
Garner said of the expense of double-hulled tankers. ``What matters
is the environment. ... The money doesn't mean anything;, the
environment does.''
   Congress is considering laws requiring double-hulled tankers. On
the state level, California Attorney General John Van de Kamp
endorsed an initiative calling for a cleanup superfund.

   King Henry VIII's love letters to Anne Boleyn _
eight years before he ordered her beheaded _ are part of a display
of royal valentines that show the soppy side of Britain's rulers.
   ``Mine own sweetheart, these shall be to advertise you of the
great aloneness that I find here since your departing,'' said
Henry's letter, signed H.R. and dated 1528. The R stands for Rex,
Latin for king.
   The impulsive king's testaments of ardor are among 100
transcribed documents on view that span more than 450 years.
   Some of the letters are steamy, some heartfelt and many dispel
historical cliches, said Michele Brown, curator of the valentine
display, which is part of the Royal Britain exhibition at London's
Barbican center.
   King Edward VII, who reigned from 1901-1910, was known as
``Edward the Caresser,'' for his involvement with mistresses,
including actress Lillie Langtry, Ms. Brown said.
   ``While you'd expect him to be the great wooer with words, and
his letters an absolute hotbed of passion and love, all he talks
about is the weather,'' she said.
   However, his mother and father, Queen Victoria and Prince
Albert, exchanged letters that contradict the sometimes icy image
of the couple, the curator said.
   ``The textbook view is that Victoria was absolutely besotted by
Albert and he was a cold fish and laid back and thought about
England all of the time, but the letters are very revealing,'' Ms.
Brown said.
   Albert wrote to Victoria just before they were married in 1840:
``Dearest, best beloved Victoria _ Already another dear, dear,
letter from you which has wholly charmed me, for it once again
tells me you love me, and proves that you love me truly and
faithfully ... Do you remember how I warmed your dear little hands
every day in the lovely little blue room? In quiet hours I live on
such memories. Good, dear, charming Victoria, in my thoughts I am
very much with you.''
   The most recent letters in the exhibition are those of King
Edward VIII, who abdicated the throne in 1936 to marry American
divorcee Wallis Warfield Simpson.
   Addressing her as ``my own darling peaches,'' Edward wrote
before they married: ``God! I love you my Wallis my beloved
sweetheart, more and more and more. I'm holding so tight all the
time until that dear lovely precious day. Oh! God make it come
quickly and bless WE (Wallis and Edward) this year and always!''
   The letters were published after the Duchess of Windsor died in
1986 because she wanted to correct the impression that she had
lured the king from his throne.
   The copies were made from love letters found in the Public
Record Office, the Royal Collection and other repositories, Ms.
Brown said.
   ``The letters from Henry VIII to Anne Boleyn are in the Vatican
library because they were relevant to his divorce, which led to the
split of the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of England,'' Ms.
Brown explained.
   Ms. Brown said she believes today's royals are unlikely to leave
behind many interesting love letters.
   ``The letters (on display) are all well-thought out and
composed, they're not the odd bashed out note,'' she said. ``I'm
afraid the telephone has taken over now and there are very few love
letters.''

   President Bush says he will await the expected
visit of South African President F. W. de Klerk before deciding
whether to respond to the release of Nelson Mandela by improving
relations with that country.
   Bush is barred by law from lifting U.S. sanctions against South
Africa until specific reforms are adopted, and there is strong
support in Congress for keeping the sanctions in place as a lever
to encourage additional dismantling of white supremacist rule.
   The sanctions impose severe restrictions on American investment
in South Africa and purchases of the country's exports. The
Congressional Black Caucus issued a statement Monday saying any
talk of lifting the sanctions is premature.
   But there are other overtures the administration could make
toward South Africa in recognition of de Klerk's fresh approach
toward the country's black majority.
   The United States could make some gestures to ease South
Africa's international isolation by dispatching a high-level
emissary to Pretoria or by engaging in efforts to ease United
Nations restrictions on dealing with that country.
   Although Bush seemed in no hurry to act on any options, there
was little doubt Mandela's release and other gestures improved the
atmosphere considerably between Washington and Pretoria.
   Bush alluded to the warming on Monday when he called Mandela's
release after 27 years in prison ``another important sign that
South Africa may soon begin negotiating a democratic non-racial
society and at last be on the way to ending apartheid once and for
all.''
   The State Department said it was heartened by the moderate tone
of Mandela's remarks since his release on Sunday.
   ``We found noteworthy his expression of hope that a climate
conducive to a negotiated settlement would be created soon so that
there may no longer be the need for armed struggle,'' it said.
   Official contacts between the two countries dropped off sharply
after the sanctions were imposed by Congress in 1986 over
then-President Reagan's veto.
   Now de Klerk is preparing to become the first South African
president to visit the United States. The administration issued
separate invitations to de Klerk and Mandela to visit Washington
but no dates have been set.
   Bush told a news conference Monday he wants to discuss the
sanctions issue with both de Klerk and Mandela and said the two
South Africans also should negotiate.
   ``And then out of that, I think we'll have a much more realistic
picture of what the United States might do in the future,'' he said.
   Bush added that a White House visit by de Klerk would be a
``major step'' in U.S.-South African relations, but that more
substantive action would not be appropriate until afterward.
   Bush said he finds some of the sanctions counterproductive and
played down the suggestion that they had a key role in inducing
South Africa to signal moves toward a more equitable political
system.
   ``What's really changed is the mindset of the South African
leadership,'' Bush said. ``I think that we ought to give Mr. de
Klerk certain credit for being able to look much more realistically
about political change, and hopefully, more favorably about a
society that eventually eliminates this racism that is equated with
apartheid.''
   As for the U.S. sanctions, the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act
stipulated that before they could be lifted, South Africa had to
free all political prisoners and meet at least three of four other
conditions.
   De Klerk already has met one of the conditions by legalizing the
African National Congress and other anti-apartheid groups.
   But Senate Democratic Leader George Mitchell of Maine said,
``The essence of these conditions is the dismantling of the South
African laws which are the foundation of their system of racial
segregation.
   ``No fundamental change has been made in that direction yet, and
such change must occur before we can consider lifting sanctions,''
Mitchell said in a statement.
   Other conditions include release of other political prisoners;
repeal of the state of emergency and freeing of all those detained
under it; repeal of laws which restrict where non-whites can live
and work, and government agreement to enter good-faith negotiations
with representatives of the black majority.

<HEAD>Building Soviet Opposition Parties an Unfamiliar Task</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   He is 32, an intense young man bent on
political change, dealing in the familiar fare of issues,
endorsements and voter opinion as he looks toward the 1990
campaign. Men and women like him do the daily business of U.S.
politics as the executive directors of state Democratic and
Republican parties.
   While their tasks are comparable, their challenges are not.
   For Arkadiy Murashev is secretary to a fledgling opposition
movement in the Soviet Union, seeking to build a political party,
not just manage one.
   Murashev, a Moscow physicist come to political life when his
scientist colleagues nominated him for the Congress of People's
Deputies, told of the work and aims of his movement in sometimes
halting English.
   He was in Washington in what might seem unlikely company, on a
10-day visit sponsored by conservative political activists.
   The Free Congress Foundation and its president, Paul Weyrich,
were his sponsors and guides at a series of sessions with
conservative groups, government officials and members of Congress.
Weyrich and six other conservative political tacticians went to
Eastern Europe and to Moscow last fall on a two-week political
training mission. Murashev was one of about 45 Soviet participants.
   The Soviet political rules changed while he was in Washington,
as leaders of the Communist Party agreed to relinquish its
guarantee of monopoly power and to permit the creation of
opposition parties.
   ``We must move with the tide, must move with the people, and not
be left behind by events,'' said government spokesman Gennadi
Gerasimov.
   Murashev said the changes adapted to reality. ``This plenum
declared the situation that already existed in the Soviet Union,''
he told a group of conservative activists and congressmen. ``And
when we return, for us, it's no change.''
   He is secretary of the Interregional Group, an opposition
umbrella group claiming ties with about 400 of the 2,250 members of
the Congress of People's Deputies. Its leading figure is Boris
Yeltsin, the one member of the Communist Central Committee who
voted against Mikhail S. Gorbachev's political reform plan because
he contends it doesn't go far enough. Yeltsin wants an immediate
change to a multi-party democratic system and a free market economy.
   Gorbachev has liberalized the Soviet political system gradually
over the past five years, changes that permitted formation of the
Interregional Group and other movements. The Congress of People's
Deputies was created as part of the Gorbachev reform movement; it
first met in 1989. The opposition has a foothold there; about 10
percent of its delegates are not members of the Communist Party.
That legislative body meets again late in the spring and is to
consider the constitutional changes the communist leadership agreed
to last Wednesday.
   Strictly speaking, the Interregional Group is not a political
party. ``Theoretically, they haven't had other parties,'' Weyrich
said. ``But it has all the attributes of a party.''
   The group sponsors and supports candidates in Soviet elections.
It has a platform and takes positions on issues. It is organizing
for regional elections late this winter and early in the spring,
balloting comparable to state legislative elections in the United
States.
   Murashev won his seat in the Congress of People's Deputies last
year, with 54 percent of the vote in a four-way race. Among the
rivals he beat to win a five-year term was the district Communist
Party secretary. At the time, Murashev was a candidate for
Communist Party membership, a process that takes a year. When he
became eligible in December, Murashev said, he declined membership.
``I refused to be a communist after that.''
   By his account, the competition in Soviet elections so far has
been dominated by personalities and their chosen issues. ``Tell me,
this candidate, is he against Yeltsin or with him?'' Murashev said
voters would ask him. He said people also look for lists of
candidates favored by the Interregional Group. ``They say if you
give us the list of candidates, we will be voting for them,'' he
said.
   Murashev thinks more formal party structures will follow soon,
beginning with the equivalent of a European social democratic
party. That's already happening in independence-minded Lithuania,
Latvia and Estonia.
   At first, he said, the fledgling opposition parties probably
will cooperate, going into competition with one another as the
process matures.
   For all the speed of reform so far, that may take time. The
Communist Party may yield its constitutional dominance, but it will
still have the money, the manpower, the organization, the know-how,
all the components of political power. It also has jobs _ patronage
on a scale no American political boss could have imagined.
   Obstacles notwithstanding, Murashev told the conservatives that
Soviet political reform cannot be undone now. ``The process in the
Soviet Union has gone so far, it has become irreversible,'' he said.

<HEAD>Banks Need to Do Better Job on Real Estate Portfolio, Regulator
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Banks with growing portfolios of sour real
estate loans need to do a better job, a top federal regulator says.
   ``Over the last year ... examination activity has revealed a
significant number of fundamental deficiencies and negative trends
in national bank real estate lending which require immediate
attention,'' Comptroller of the Currency Robert L. Clarke said in a
strongly worded memorandum released Monday.
   The memo to board members and chief executive officers at 4,200
nationally charted banks singled out three areas for criticism.
   First, ``basic lending principles have been ignored or
compromised to increase volume and achieve higher levels of
interest and fee income,'' Clarke said. In particular, banks are
not requiring borrowers to invest enough of their own money in real
estate projects.
   Second, ``too many banks have failed to obtain accurate,
independent and timely appraisals'' of the real estate projects to
which they are lending.
   And third, some banks are engaging in practices that make it
difficult to determine when a real estate project is going bad.
Those include inflating the loan amount so borrowers can cover the
interest payments in the early years of the loan and operating with
incomplete or non-existent foreclosure policies.
   Clarke's warning follows earlier reports of a big increase in
real estate problems in New England and Arizona, on top of existing
problems in the oil-producing states of Texas, Oklahoma and
Louisiana.
   The level of sour real estate loans at national banks in New
England hit $2 billion at the end of September, representing 6
percent of their real estate portfolio, quadruple the default rate
of two years ago.
   In Arizona, national banks listed $825 million in bad real
estate loans, 20 percent of the total.
   Bank of New England Corp., the region's second-largest bank
holding company, alone reported a $1.05 billion loss in 1989,
raising questions among analysts about whether it can survive.
   Bank management should ``initiate corrective action promptly,''
Clarke said. Examiners have ``been and will continue to be
aggressive ... (and) have been instructed to recommend formal
enforcement actions as appropriate.''
   The get-tough policy of his examiners has prompted complaints
from builders and others in New England that reliable and solvent
borrowers were being denied credit.
   Clarke said nothing in the memo ``is intended to discourage
sound real estate ... lending'' and that ``the vast majority of
national banks have not deviated from traditional high lending
standards.''

   The AFL-CIO is likely to continue a decade of
dodging the abortion issue, even though some elements of the labor
federation want to adopt a pro-choice stand at next week's winter
meeting in Florida.
   ``We have enough to say grace over without taking on the
abortion issue,'' said Duke McVey, president of the Missouri State
Labor Council AFL-CIO.
   Still, behind-the-scenes maneuvering on whether the 14.1 million
member federation should support legalized abortion or sit the
issue out is expected to dominate much of the Executive Council
meeting in Bal Harbour, where the AFL-CIO's 33-member board gathers
each February.
   Pro-choice union officials fear the council, which has
sidestepped a stand for more than a decade, will ultimately stay
neutral.
   ``The majority of them are male. They're not children; they're
getting up there in years and are kind of fixed in their attitudes.
They may not want to bite on this,'' said Jay Foreman, executive
vice president of the United Food and Commercial Workers
International Union. ``The question is whether they want to take
any risks.''
   Foreman and other pro-choice labor leaders think the issue has
workplace ramifications because it affects the economic well-being
of working women and raises questions of health care coverage and
the ability of health care workers to do their job.
   But other union officials, including McVey, say abortion ``has
nothing to do with 40 hours a week or 20 bucks an hour.''
   ``It splits our members and it doesn't address wages, hours or
conditions of employment,'' McVey said.
   A number of rank-and-file union members ``feel very strongly
about the issue. They don't support their union doing that kind of
activity and they don't want to pay dues to a union that does,''
McVey said.
   Yet several pro-choice union leaders noted the AFL-CIO
historically has gotten involved in issues not directly related to
collective bargaining, such as civil rights and school busing.
   Pro-choice union officials, trying to counter a National Right
to Life letter-writing campaign that asks the AFL-CIO to refuse to
take a stand, are pressing for adoption of a pro-choice resolution.
   That would put the federation in line with the stance taken by
many of its political allies, such as the Democratic Party and
various women's and civil rights groups.
   At a convention last fall of delegates from all 90 AFL-CIO
unions, the delegates declined to adopt any of the half dozen
pro-choice resolutions submitted, and instead referred them to the
Executive Council.
   There is no organized move afoot for the federation to condemn
abortion.
   William Wynn, president of the United Food and Commercial
Workers International Union and a pro-choice member of the council,
chairs the committee that will determine whether the federation
should take a position.
   Wynn predicted the committee ``will be able to come to a
definitive conclusion that will be responsive to everybody's
feelings, everybody's emotions. I tend to believe we have the
intelligence to do that.''
   He said the panel might be able to adopt a pro-choice position
as long as it agreed on language acknowledging moral and religious
concerns. But if the panel fails to recommend a pro-choice
position, it would likely draft a statement explaining why the
federation should stay away from the issue, he said.
   Sponsors of last fall's pro-choice resolutions urged the council
to act by the February meeting. That would have allowed labor to
use the decision as it begins making early decisions on 1990
political candidates.
   But even the strongest pro-choice officials said abortion would
not serve as a litmus test for candidates.
   ``It's not critical to the election cycle. We're not a
single-issue group,'' Foreman said. Anti-abortion candidates ``who
were with us in every other way'' could still win labor's
endorsement, he said.
   The labor movement has longstanding ties to the Roman Catholic
Church, and some opponents of last fall's pro-choice resolutions
said that taking such a stand could hurt union organizing among
blue-collar Catholics.

   Former baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn said he
and his wife moved to Florida to start a new life, not to hide from
creditors of his former law firm.
   ``The decline and ultimate failure of Myerson &amp; Kuhn was a
traumatic experience for both of us and its aftereffects continue
to be,'' Kuhn said Monday.
   ``We both felt a change of environs was a necessity for our
happiness and health. The months we have spent in Florida have
thoroughly pursuaded us of the wisdom of this decision.''
   Myerson &amp; Kuhn collapsed in December and Marine Midland bank
claims the firm owes it $3.1 million in outstanding loans. The firm
charged in court papers last week that Kuhn sold his house in
Ridgewood, N.J., and moved to Pontre Vedra Beach, Fla., in an
attempt to put his assets out of reach. Florida law does not allow
residences to be attached.
   Kuhn denied the charges.
   ``The intimations in the press that I have hidden from the
Myerson &amp; Kuhn creditors are unfair,'' Kuhn said in a statement.
   The former commissioner said he had created a Florida
corporation named the Kent Group Inc., and that he would become a
consultant through the corporation in sports and other business
areas.

   The Rev. Jerry Falwell, who once battled
to keep Jim Bakker away from PTL, says the 45-year prison sentence
given to the fallen television evangelist is too harsh.
   ``No doubt a debt to society had to be paid, but 45 years is
unreasonable,'' Falwell said Sunday night before preaching at
Calvary Church.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter sentenced Bakker in October
for defrauding followers who had sent him $158 million in exchange
for lodging guarantees at PTL's Heritage USA Christian retreat in
nearby Fort Mill, S.C.
   Falwell took over at PTL following Bakker's March 1987
resignation in a sex and money scandal involving former church
secretary Jessica Hahn. Falwell resigned six months later, after
Bakker announced he wanted to return to the ministry.
   ``I think everybody here _ including the court _ just got caught
up in the spectacular nature of what was going on,'' Falwell said.
``Had Bakker's sentence been 10 to 15 years, I don't think there
would have been a grumble anywhere in the country.''

   Pete Seeger will give a benefit concert
Saturday to celebrate the 90th birthday of author Meridel Le Sueur,
who documented people's struggles during the Depression.
   ``Pete Seeger. I've known him for 60 years. ... He was part of
the struggle, like Woody Guthrie,'' said Le Sueur, who turns 90 on
Feb. 22. ``I had people's speech, they had people's song. For the
people you've grown with in militant struggle, there's an affection
you can't express.''
   Le Sueur broke into the mainstream in 1927 with the publication
of her short story ``Persephone'' in Dial magazine.
   Her career flowered in the 1930s, when her works were published
in many journals, newspapers and magazines, and reached a peak in
1940 with the publication of ``Salute to Spring,'' an anthology
praised by Sinclair Lewis and Carl Sandburg.

   Andy Rooney says he's been getting
``incredible'' support from colleagues and strangers since his
suspension by CBS for racial remarks attributed to him by a
magazine.
   ``It's like being at your own funeral. People I didn't even know
liked me have come to my support,'' Rooney said Monday.
   A CBS spokesman said the network's audience services unit has
received about 2,600 phone calls backing Rooney and 45 supporting
his suspension.
   Rooney last week was ordered suspended for three months by CBS
News President David Burke after The Advocate, a biweekly
homosexual-oriented magazine based in Los Angeles, quoted him as
saying blacks have watered down their genes because ``the less
intelligent ones are the ones that have the most children.''
   The 69-year-old humorist has denied the remarks.

<HEAD>Legislator's Contest Draws 500 Suggestions For New Laws</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW LENOX, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Illinois residents who entered a
legislator's ``There Ought To Be A Law Contest'' say they want more
public toilets, lower taxes, a change in election scheduling and no
kissing in cars.
   State Rep. Larry Wennlund said Monday that 500 such ideas have
arrived at his New Lenox office in response to the contest he calls
an experiment in ``real grassroots democracy.''
   Eileen Bludeau of Oak Park suggested election days be scheduled
on Sundays so more people could vote. And C.H. West of Northbrook
said there ought to be a law against talking on car phones while
driving.
   ``People have good ideas _ good, practical ideas,'' said
Wennlund, whose northern Illinois district includes some of
Chicago's southern suburbs. ``This is just a way to get those ideas
to somebody who can do something about them.''
   The Republican legislator advertised the contest last month,
asking entrants to tell him in 100 words or less what laws the
state should pass.
   The contest closed Jan. 31 and a winner will be announced in two
weeks, with judging based on ``the practicality and the worthiness
of the idea,'' he said.
   Wennlund said the winners, chosen from adult and student
categories, will get a trip to the Capitol in Springfield next
month. They'll be invited to spend a day on the floor of the House
of Representatives with Wennlund and watch their proposal be
introduced as legislation.
   The largest number of entries dealt with ideas for lower
property taxes, and most of those were from the elderly, Wennlund
said.
   Another popular suggestion _ making up about 10 percent of the
entries _ was for a recycling bill charging deposits for returnable
bottles.
   And then there were these suggestions:
   ``There ought to be a law that citizens use their common sense.
Thank you,'' said Eileen Slater, 70, of Chicago.
   There ought to be a law that every business serving the public
be required to provide a public bathroom, one entrant said, adding
the argument that, ``When you have to go, you have to go.''
   From the second grade at Lincoln Elementary School in a Monmouth
came: ``No drinking in Illinois, no drugs, no kissing in cars.''
   And from the somewhat more mature set at the school _ the third
graders _ there was: ``No naked movies on TV. No playboy channel in
Illinois'' and ``No school for 300 years.''

<HEAD>Dairy Group Says Farm Proposal Would Cause Volatile Milk Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Milk Producers Federation says
the administration's dairy plan in the 1990 farm bill could result
in greater price instability for producers and consumers.
   The Bush proposal would continue the Agriculture Department's
current basic milk price support formula but also seeks more
flexibility in adjusting supports in line with market conditions.
   ``This plan would only create more instability in the dairy
industry, with wilder swings in consumer prices and the loss of
dairy farmers throughout the country,'' said Tom Camerlo, president
of the National Milk Producers Federation.
   Camerlo said in the federation's newsletter that the plan
amounts to ``even more and deeper price cuts'' for dairy farmers.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter unveiled the
administration's farm bill proposals last week.
   Dairy price supports are carried out indirectly through USDA
purchases of surplus manufactured dairy products _ butter, cheese
and non-fat dry milk _ so that prices paid to farmers by dealers
can be maintained at or above specified support levels.
   The current program authorized by the 1985 farm law allows milk
price supports to be raised or lowered according to market
conditions when USDA purchases are above or below designated
trigger levels.
   As it is now, if USDA estimates annual dairy purchases at 2.5
billion pounds of milk equivalent or less, the basic price support
rate must be raised by 50 cents per 100 pounds on Jan. 1.
   But if annual purchases are expected to exceed 5 billion pounds,
the support prices is lowered 50 cents. No change is made if
purchases are between 2.5 billion and 5 billion pounds of milk
equivalent.
   ``Government surplus purchases have fallen from 12.3 billion
pounds, milk equivalent, milkfat basis, in fiscal 1986 to a
projected 8 billion pounds in fiscal 1990,'' the proposal said.
   Meanwhile inventories of government-owned dairy surpluses have
declined to less than half of what they were in 1986, and the
annual cost of the dairy support program has dropped from $2.3
billion in 1986 to a projected $500 million in the 1990 fiscal year.
   Under the Bush proposal, annual adjustments could be made in
increments of 25 to 50 cents per 100 pounds of milk instead of the
flat 50-cent increase or decrease.
   And it would allow stiffer reductions if USDA purchases rose
above 7.5 billion pounds of milk equivalent, including cuts of 50
to 75 cents between 7.5 billion and 10 billion pounds, and $1 for
purchases over 10 billion pounds.
   Currently, including a 50-cent cut on Jan. 1, the basic milk
support is $10.10 per 100 pounds.
   According to a projection developed by National Milk Producers
Federation economists, the administration's proposal could result
in back-to-back $1 price support cuts in 1990 and 1991.
   ``These cuts would drop the dairy support price to $8.10 per
hundredweight in less than two years,'' the federation said.

   An Agriculture Department report says the
number of workers employed by farmers declined seasonally in
January and was down about 2 percent from a year earlier.
   The quarterly report said Monday the hired work force on farms
was estimated at 690,000 during the week of Jan. 7-13, down from
983,000 in October. A year ago in January the work force was
701,000.
   Those did not include 143,000 ``agricultural service'' workers
provided by crew chiefs and labor contractors. In October, those
totaled 308,000 worker, and in January 1989 they were estimated at
152,000.
   Mostly dry weather and above-normal temperatures prevailed
across the nation during the Jan. 7-13 survey week, the report said.
   The report said the national figures for hired workers had a
sampling error of 3.7 percent.
   Average pay for all workers hired directly by farmers was
reported at $5.70 per hour, up from $5.42 in October and $5.51 a
year ago, the report said.
   For workers hired by contractors, there was no national wage
rate available. However, workers in California were reported at
$6.20 per hour, compared with $6.41 in October and $6.42 a year
ago. Florida workers averaged $6.23 per hour, compared with $5.15
in October and $5.79 a year earlier.

Agriculture Department.
   About 3.3 million colonies produced honey in 1989, a 3 percent
increase from 1988, the report said. But the average yield per
colony was only 51.1 pounds, down from 66.3 pounds in 1988.
   ``Adverse conditions were encountered in most states and
included wet weather, restrictions on movement early in the year,
dry weather, disease and mite infestations throughout the year,''
the report said.
   Prices for the 1989 crop averaged 48.4 cents per pound, down 1.6
cents from 1988, the report said.

<HEAD>Newly Discovered Sousa March To Get American Premiere At Yale</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newly discovered march by John Philip
Sousa, written two years before his death and featuring a drum
cadence that recalls his famous ``Semper Fidelis,'' will have its
American premiere Friday at Yale.
   The work was discovered among the bandmaster's possessions at
the Library of Congress in Washington by a Sousa researcher, Loras
Schissel, who completed the nearly finished piece with the Sousa
family's permission.
   Sousa, who died in 1932, wrote about 130 marches. His most
famous works include ``Semper Fidelis'' (1888), ``Washington Post''
(1889) and ``Stars and Stripes Forever'' (1897).
   The ``Untitled March,'' which will be performed by the 70-member
Yale Concert Band at the end of an evening program, has ``all the
parts of a Sousa march you'd expect,'' said Thomas Duffy, director
of the university bands.
   Keith Brion of Hamden, a freelance symphony conductor who
specializes in Sousa concerts and who prepared a performance
edition of the march for the Yale band, said Monday he believes the
newly found work is one of Sousa's better marches, although ``the
jury is not in.''
   The 3{-minute march also will be played by the Yale band at
Carnegie Hall in New York City on Feb. 27.
   On first hearing, the march sounds closest to Sousa's Marine
march, said Duffy.
   But the work has more modern harmonies than Sousa's earlier
works, Duffy and Brion said.
   All but a couple of measures were completed by Sousa, so the
work that will be played is in no sense a reconstruction, Duffy
said.
   Brion conducted the world premiere in October in Stockholm with
the Stockholm Symphonic Wind Orchestra. The performance was carried
on national television.
   The march is being performed at Yale in memory of John Philip
Sousa III, the composer's grandson, who died last month.
   Yale was seeking the grandson's permission to perform the work
when the school found out he had died, Duffy said. The band
subsequently was granted the right to play the piece by Sousa's
great-grandson, John Philip Sousa IV, who lives in Los Angeles.
   The bandmaster who became known as the ``March King'' was the
leader of the U.S. Marine Corps Band from 1880 to 1892. He left
that position to form his own band, which gained wide popularity.
   The music has remained popular because Sousa had ``an inspired
gift for melody and rhythm,'' Brion said.

<HEAD>FDA to Allow Last-Resort Use of Symbion Devices</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration
approved for last-resort use the artificial heart developed by Dr.
Robert Jarvik, modifying a decision made last month, the University
of Arizona said Monday.
   The FDA last month withdrew its approval of the device both as a
permanent implant and as a temporary bridge to transplantation,
saying there were ``serious deficiencies'' with its manufacture.
The agency also withdrew its approval of the acute ventricular
assist device, which helps the natural heart pump.
   The artificial heart was initially called the Jarvik-7, but
Jarvik no longer is associated with Symbion Inc. of Tempe, Ariz.,
which markets the product as the Symbion-7. Symbion also markets
the second device.
   University Medical Center said in a statement Monday that the
FDA now would not object to the devices being used as a last resort
if all other approved alterntative treatments have failed or were
deemed inappropriate and when no other life-saving device is
available to save a patient's life.
   In response to last month's decision, Dr. Jack G. Copeland,
director of the medical center's artificial heart and transplant
programs, said he might go ahead and use the devices if the need
arose. The effect of their withdrawal would be ``to deprive
potentially hundreds of critically ill patients of a chance for
life,'' Copeland said.
   The president and chief executive officer of Symbion, Richard W.
Alder, confirmed Monday night that the FDA had mofidied its earlier
decision and would permit last-resort, live-saving uses ``under
certain, very prescribed conditions.''
   The change was outlined in a letter the agency sent fairly
recently to organizations, including the medical center, which had
been using the devices on an investigative basis, he said.
   Alder said Symbion and FDA officials were arranging meetings to
try to resolve issues remaining from last month's decision.
   ``We are pleased that the FDA has recognized the value of the
devices as a last resort for critically ill patients. The use of
this equipment is vital to save lives,'' Copeland said Monday.
   Copeland said he had called FDA officials ``as an individual
physician'' after its initial letter and told them, ```Now we're in
limbo again. Every time we put this device in somebody's gonna say
that we're defying the FDA, and we know scientifically that they're
good devices.
   ``I felt that it was an untenable position they were putting us
into,'' Copeland added. He said FDA officials told him ``they
thought I had a point.''
   Copeland said he is certain the agency also must have been
contacted by other surgeons.
   He said the FDA officials ``are reasonable people; I think they
came up with a reasonable decision.''

   Federal officials thought they had found a way
to help evaluate the effectiveness of a new law extending
transitional Medicaid and child-care benefits to some public
assistance recipients who get jobs.
   But to compare the effects of the new benefits with the old,
they would have to deny the new benefits to some people.
   That's how the Department of Health and Human Services came to
approve the Texas Welfare Reform Demonstration project, according
to HHS officials.
   ``This gave us an opportunity to have something to contribute to
our knowledge,'' said Mike Fishman, acting deputy of income
security policy at HHS.
   But HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan on Monday night ordered the
pilot project revised.
   ``No person receiving welfare in the state of Texas has been
denied or will be denied benefits to which they are entitled under
federal law,'' he said.
   The initial version of the project actually began last July,
providing 12 months of extended Medicaid and child care benefits to
most of the 8,000 participants who got jobs or entered training
programs.
   But 800 of the participants were eligible only for the four
months of extended transitional benefits available to all other
recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children and Medicaid
who are not in a pilot program.
   The purpose of the study was to see whether the added benefits
helped keep people off the welfare rolls. Officials wanted to see
whether extended benefits encouraged people to take and remain in
entry-level jobs that are unlikely to offer medical insurance or
child care benefits immediately.
   This kind of experiment has long been used in science, medicine
and industry as a tool of evaluation, and has been used for more
than 20 years in social research to measure the effectiveness of
social policies.
   And like other most other social experiments the government has
allowed, it was set up so that the ``experimental group'' was
getting added benefits while the ``control group'' got only the
level of benefits already offered.
   However, the project had been designed before Congress passed a
bill giving all people on AFDC and Medicaid 12 months of extended
transitional benefits beginning April 1 of this year.
   Thus if the Texas pilot project had continued beyond April 1,
that would have meant the 800 people now in the ``control'' group
would continue to get only four months benefits _ even though,
starting April 1, federal law would entitle them to 12 months.
   HHS officials suggested to Texas officials that they propose
continuing the program. Texas did, and HHS approved it, ``in the
interest of understanding the effects of increased transitional
benefits,'' Fishman said.
   But after the plans were outlined in a Dallas Morning News story
on Sunday that was distributed nationwide, HHS officials began
getting calls and Sullivan called off the plans.
   Officials said Sullivan was unaware of the project's provisions
until then. When they were outlined to him, he made it clear ``he
does not want this type of provision included in any of our
programs,'' said Martin Gerry, assistant secretary for planning and
evaluation. Gerry said he knew of no current HHS programs that deny
benefits entitled by federal law.
   Five other states _ Ohio, Washington state, New York, New Jersey
and Wisconsin _ were conducting similar demonstration projects,
which also have had to be revised. None has proposed to continue
the current transitional benefits past the April 1 effective date
of the new benefits as set in law.

   Ella Fitzgerald, honored at a benefit concert
for the American Heart Association, had some surprises in store for
herself _ and for her audience.
   She was surprised when Quincy Jones and Oscar Peterson, who
hadn't been announced as being part of the concert, showed up and
took part.
   But the Monday night audience got the best surprise when, near
the end of four hours, the 71-year-old Miss Fitzgerald, who had
been seated in Avery Fisher Hall, was escorted to the stage. They
expected a brief thank-you, but, instead, Miss Fitzgerald began
singing ``Honeysuckle Rose.''
   Then she thanked the musicians _ and added: ``I think we could
do another one.'' The audience screamed its delight.
   She sang ``Lady Be Good,'' inserting in the lyrics a call for
Joe Williams to join her. He motioned for Clark Terry to step out
from the trumpet section, and the three traded scat phrases till
minutes to midnight.
   The ``Hearts for Ella'' band, led by Benny Carter, was alone
enough to delight a jazz fan. It included Stan Getz, Phil Woods,
David Sanborn, James Moody, Jon Faddis, Red Rodney, Al Grey, Hank
Jones, Ray Brown and Louis Bellson. One of its gems was ``Stompin'
at the Savoy.'' Quincy Jones conducted his ``Stockholm Sweetenin'.''
   Classical violinist Itzhak Perlman provided several of the
evening's high points. He and Bobby McFerrin did a swinging ``Blue
Skies.'' Then he played hot fiddle with Melissa Manchester, Janis
Spiegel and Cheryl Bentyne in the Boswell Sisters' 1931 arrangement
of ``It's You.''
   After pianist Oscar Peterson played ``Who Can I Turn To?'', he
and Perlman dueted on a ravishing ``Summertime.'' The band,
Peterson and Perlman played ``Stormy Weather,'' after which Benny
Carter summed up, ``It don't get much better than that.''
   Trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie played and sang a tender ``I Waited
for You.'' The Copasetics and teen sensation Savion Glover
tapdanced. Cab Calloway sang Miss Fitzgerald's ``A-Tisket,
A-Tasket.'' Pianist Tommy Flannagan, her music director for 10
years, played ``Mr. Paganini.''
   George Shearing told about playing intermission piano at the
Three Deuces when Hank Jones and Ray Brown were accompanying Miss
Fitzgerald. He played ``Ella's (Lulu's) Back in Town.''
   Lena Horne, cohost with Perlman, said her uncle told her, at 18,
not to copy Ella Fitzgerald. She told him, ``Every woman who wants
to be a singer wants to sing like Ella Fitzgerald.''
   The New York Heart Association intends to establish the Ella
Fitzgerald Research Fellowship with money raised at the benefit.

   The dollar inched down against the yen Tuesday,
while the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost ground.
   The dollar closed at 144.48 yen , down 0.24 yen from last
Friday's close of 144.72 yen. After opening at 144.53 yen, the
dollar was traded between 144.35 and 144.63 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which shed
228.10 points Friday, fell another 181.11 points, or 0.48 percent,
to close at 37,107.03 yen.
   Financial markets in Japan were closed Monday for a national
holiday.
   Currency dealers said there was no discernable movement on the
exchange market due to a lack of new market-moving news.
   Trading ``remained almost locked,'' although there was some
dollar-buying by oil importers for settlements after the three-day
weekend in Japan, said Akihiko Hori, a dealer with Mitsui Bank.
   Hori said dollar-yen rates will not fluctuate much until after
the general election for Japan's lower house of Parliament on
Sunday.
   Similarly, on the stock market, share prices generally remained
weak as many investors retreated to the sidelines with the lower
house elections only five days away, securities traders said.
   Investors also were discouraged by a 29.06-point decline in the
Dow Jones industrial average overnight, said a dealer with a major
Japanese securities firm, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

   The Harvard Business School, whose graduates
ritually wave dollar bills over their heads at commencement, has
admitted the first four Soviets to its MBA class of 1992 to learn
the ABCs of capitalism.
   ``If the ruble is convertible by then, I will wave a ruble, if
not, the red flag,'' said Aleksei Maximov, 30, one of the four
selected for the school's two-year master of business
administration program.
   They have been given five-month positions in U.S. companies to
gain hands-on experience in capitalism before entering Harvard.
   Maximov, who was a research associate in a Soviet think tank, is
an intern at S.C. Johnson and Son Inc. in Racine, Wis., studying
American marketing and product management techniques.
   Joseph Bakaleynick, 38, had been a chief financial officer for a
tractor factory before his stint at Braxton Associates, a
Boston-based consulting firm associated with Deloitte &amp; Touche.
   Aleskei Kolesnikov, 27, who traveled abroad for the U.S.S.R.
Chamber of Commerce and Industry, now works at Johnson &amp; Johnson,
of New Brunswick, N.J.
   And Besik Sikharulidze, 25, headed a scientific consulting firm
in Tbilisi, Soviet Georgia, and is now working at Pioneer Hi-Bred
International, an agribusiness technology firm in Des Moines, Iowa.
   Giving Soviets exposure to U.S. business practices could prove
invaluable to Americans who try to move into the Soviet economy
later, said Scott Fraser, a partner in Deloitte &amp; Touche who said
he first suggested that Harvard seek out Soviet applicants.
   ``My sense is if American industry waits too long, they will get
left in the lurch,'' he said.
   After working at the U.S. firms, the Soviets will take classes
at Harvard's summer school and then enter the MBA program.
   Upon graduation, they have agreed to return to the Soviet Union
and work for a state-run enterprise for five years.

   Nissan Motor Corp. finally lifted the
advertising lid on its Infiniti luxury cars, showing off the
vehicles instead of rocks, birds and pussy willows.
   Nissan was criticized by some automotive advertising analysts
for its unusual ad campaign last year. While an announcer spoke
softly, viewers saw such pastoral scenes as countrysides or fields.
Viewers didn't see the car. Similarly, print ads were car-less.
   Now, the second stage of the advertising campaign will air in
less than 45 television markets, those where the company has
dealerships, company officials said Monday.
   ``If you had to do advertising to get a name established, we did
that in spades,'' said Thomas Mignanelli, executive vice president
of U.S. sales.

<HEAD>Reagan To Give Taped Testimony For Poindexter Trial</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Reagan will give videotaped
testimony Friday in a Los Angeles courtroom to lawyers for former
national security adviser John Poindexter and Iran-Contra
prosecutors.
   U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene on Monday rejected
proposals by Richard Beckler, one of Poindexter's lawyers, to delay
the questioning of Reagan until the government finished presenting
its case and to have Reagan come to Washington to give the
testimony.
   Greene said he would ``consider the president's wishes'' and was
prepared to travel to California for the testimony.
   In order to edit the Reagan tape and to attempt to resolve
disputes over some 150 classified documents, Greene moved back the
start of the trial two weeks to March 5. Poindexter is charged with
conspiracy, obstructing Congress and making false statements in the
Iran-Contra scandal.
   Greene also rejected a suggestion by Reagan lawyer Theodore
Olson that the former president be questioned at his office in Los
Angeles. The federal courthouse has more space and also has secure
facilities to house classified documents, said the judge.
   Seven news organizations want the press and public admitted to
the deposition, but Greene said he doubts he will let them in
because of concern over possible disclosure of classified
information.
   He will rule on the news media's request before Friday.
   A week ago, the judge said Beckler would be permitted to ask
Reagan 154 questions plus follow-ups. The former president agreed
Friday to submit to the deposition, reserving the option to invoke
executive privilege to specific questions.
   Iran-Contra prosecutors will be permitted to cross-examine the
ex-president.
   Participating in the deposition will be prosecutors from the
office of independent counsel Lawrence Walsh, Poindexter's lawyers,
attorneys for the Justice Department, lawyers for Reagan,
representatives from U.S. intelligence agencies and the judge.
   The list of questions has been reviewed by intelligence agencies
and appears to pose few problems, with the exception of half a
dozen questions which could lead into sensitive foreign policy
matters.
   Reagan will be well prepared for the deposition.
   He knows Poindexter's questions in advance. Reagan's lawyers on
Friday received three secret proffers Poindexter submitted to the
court some time ago detailing what information he expects to elicit
from the former president.
   Poindexter, in turn, will not have access to certain information
about Reagan.
   Reagan's former national security adviser has been unable to get
some 33 diary entries from Reagan because the ex-president invoked
executive privilege last week. That dispute won't be resolved until
next month at the earliest.
   In addition, Poindexter cannot gain access to answers which
Reagan supplied to written questions by Iran-Contra prosecutors.
   Also, Poindexter's lawyers say they have had only limited
success in reviewing notes taken by Reagan.
   Poindexter lawyer Fred Robinson said some notes taken by Reagan
regarding the Iran-Contra affair are stored at the National
Archives. Greene said he wanted a report today from the Justice
Department and Iran-Contra prosecutors on ``the status and
availability of the president's notes.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush is hailing ``solid progress''
on arms talks but standing firm on his troop cut proposal despite
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's contention that it would leave the Soviet
Union outmanned in Europe.
   Bush, at a White House news conference Monday, predicted his
summit in late June with the Soviet president ``will be a major
success.''
   He said Secretary of State James A. Baker III ``made solid
progress in pushing the U.S.-Soviet agenda forward'' during his
trip to Moscow last week.
   But even as Bush applauded the Soviet Communist Party's moves
``toward pluralism'' and Gorbachev's ``statesmanlike view'' on
German unity, he acknowledged he was unwilling to accept the Soviet
leader's counterproposal on troop cuts in Europe.
   And as Bush insisted a united Germany must be part of NATO,
Gorbachev was quoted by an East German news agency as saying a
united Germany within NATO was unacceptable.
   National security adviser Brent Scowcroft said Monday night,
``That's not exactly what'' Secretary of State James A. Baker III
was told was told'' during his visit to Moscow last week. ``It was
not really as positive as that,'' Scowcroft said after a state
dinner for the president of the Congo.
   Bush expressed misgivings about economic sanctions against South
Africa, saying ``some are counterproductive.'' But he said ``I'm
bound by law'' to keep the sanctions in place until South Africa's
white minority government takes further steps to eliminate its
racist apartheid rule.
   He called the freeing of Nelson Mandela ``clearly a very
positive sign'' and expressed appreciation for South African
President F.W. de Klerk and his ``new brand of leadership.''
   On troop cuts in Europe, Bush said he was sticking with the
proposal he made Jan. 31 that Soviet troops be cut to 195,000 and
U.S. troops to 225,000. Gorbachev last week the Soviet and U.S.
troop levels should be the same.
   But Bush said, ``We've got a big ocean between us and Western
Europe. ... I don't think we need to have exact linkage from this
point on.'' His argument is that in time of war, the Soviets could
easily reinforce their troops in Central Europe from their own
territory, while the United States would have to fly or ship troops
in from this country.
   But he said, ``I wouldn't call it an impasse. This is the way it
works when you're discussing these arms control things.''
   Bush said he hoped treaties on reducing long-range nuclear
weapons and chemical weapons would be ``substantially completed''
by the June summit, and there would be progress as well toward
signing a troop reduction agreement.
   He said all three treaties might not be completed by June,
however.
   Gorbachev's troop counterproposal would mean the withdrawal of
an additional 30,000 U.S. soldiers Bush wants to keep in Britain,
Spain and Turkey.
   But, said Bush, ``Those (Soviet) troops are not wanted in
Eastern Europe anymore. Our troops are wanted by the free world.''
   Bush suggested that even if a united Germany belongs in NATO _
as West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has said _ Western alliance
forces may not be deployed inside what is now East Germany.
``There's some flexibility on deployment of NATO forces into
Eastern Europe. Nobody wants to threaten the Soviet Union,'' he
said.
   Asked about links between Mandela's African National Congress
and communist organizations, Bush said: ``I think these communist
parties for the most part are sliding downhill. What's coming
uphill is democracy and freedom.''
   He said he differs with the ANC on its support for nationalizing
South African industries. Socialism, he said, is ``folding its hand
and going over to the other side all across the world.''
   On other issues Bush:
   _Said he would decide ``fairly soon'' whether to permit the sale
of leases for offshore drilling on the California Coast. The
onetime Houston oilman said that, despite last week's tanker spill,
``I'll be damned if I think we ought to shut down offshore drilling
everywhere.''
   _Called ``counterproductive'' a new Chinese government
requirement that students spend five years working at home before
studying abroad.
   _Said he would tell the presidents of Colombia, Peru and Bolivia
at Thursday's drug summit in Colombia that the United States was
making ``major efforts'' to curb U.S. demand for cocaine.

<HEAD>D.C. Mayor Will Extend Stay at Florida Clinic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Marion Barry, facing drug charges at
home, intends to stay in a Florida substance-abuse facility longer
than the single 28-day treatment cycle, according to city
government sources.
   The sources, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of
anonymity, said Barry will stay at the Hanley-Hazelden Clinic until
at least Feb. 28 and may complete a second 28-day treatment cycle.
The mayor entered the facility Jan. 22.
   Officials at the center have declined in the past to discuss
Barry's treatment. They have said, however, that it was not unusual
for patients to remain longer than 28 days.
   Barry was arrested Jan. 18 on a misdemeanor cocaine-possession
charge. A grand jury has been hearing evidence in the mayor's case
for months.
   The Washington Post reported in today's editions that a grand
jury investigating allegations of drug use by Barry will be asked
to return a multi-count indictment this week.
   WJLA-TV said Monday that two counts would allege perjury and
five counts drug use. Federal sources would not confirm the
station's report, saying only that they expect the grand jury to
return an indictment, probably next week.
   Barry entered the Florida center for what an aide described as
primarily treatment of alcoholism. Barry publicly acknowledged
during a church service on Sunday having an alcohol dependency
problem but did not mention cocaine, according to another
worshipper.
   One government aide said city officials and the mayor's
political advisers agreed with the doctor's recommendations that
the mayor remain in Florida beyond 28 days.
   ``They (Hanley-Hazelden physicians) have determined that he
really requires additional treatment,'' said a city official
familiar with the discussions.
   ``The longer the mayor stays down there, the better he will be
able to convince people that he has genuinely been seeking
treatment,'' said one political adviser. ``This is really the
better thing for him.''

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After nearly three decades, Interstate 90's
``ramps to nowhere'' are being linked at the western end of the
Boston-to-Seattle route.
   The ramps, once the butt of jokes, were built in the early 1960s
as part of the ambitious, 2,465-mile transcontinental highway
system.
   The suspended roadway, which is west of the north-south
Interstate 5, caught the driver's eyes _ as if it was designed for
daredevil Evel Knievel.
   Then the last few miles of I-90 were laid across Lake
Washington, improving traffic between suburban Bellevue and Seattle
at a cost of $1.45 billion, and the entire complex is scheduled for
completion in the winter of 1991.
   The highway's giant concrete tentacles extend into the
commercial area south of downtown and to the Kingdome, home of the
Seahawks and Mariners sports teams. It will be finished for $68.9
million.
   The viaducts also will carry bus traffic into a new bus tunnel
built under downtown and ready for service this September.
   The roadway was to be finished in the 1960s, but the delay has
allowed for the design to be updated, said Ollie Harding, the
Washington Department of Transportation's project boss.
   Bus and car-pool lanes can be converted to use by light-rail
transit if commuter trains ever come to Seattle.
   After the devastating San Francisco quake in October, a decision
was made to strengthen a portion of an existing double-decked
portion of the roadway by installing reinforced steel rods, Harding
said.

   A widow whose husband and two daughters
were shot to death in a bowling alley massacre mourns for her
family and for her town, which was shattered by the execution-style
killings.
   Audrey Teran's anguished cry _ ``Why my little babies?'' _ is
being heard throughout what was once a sleepy town 45 miles from
the Mexican border.
   ``Our entire community is shocked by the events of Saturday,''
said Roman Catholic Bishop Ricardo Ramirez.
   ``I want to express our deepest and sincerest sympathy to the
families of those murdered. The tragedy should move us all to a
greater appreciation of life itself. Each day is precious and to be
protected, especially the lives of our children and youth.''
   At University Hills Elementary School, where Mrs. Teran's slain
6-year-old daughter, Paula Holguin, had gone to school, principal
Vince Rivera agonized over what to tell the youngsters.
   ``You're thrusting something at them that they really don't
understand. They see it on TV ... and that's fantasy, but this is
reality. How can they understand that?'' he said.
   A funeral Mass was scheduled today for part-time bowling alley
employee Amy Houser, 13, at Immaculate Heart of Mary Cathedral.
   Saturday's killings, along with an unrelated slaying the same
day, brought the number of homicide victims in this city of 55,000
people to six this year _ triple the number for all of last year.
   Police say no killings during the past 20 years have been as
brutal as the slayings of the Houser girl and Mrs. Teran's husband,
Steven, 26, and her daughters, Paula 6, and Valerie, 2.
   ``It's not the city it was when I used to roam the streets,''
said police Capt. Fred Rubio.
   Robbers confronted Teran at the Las Cruces Bowl on Saturday
morning. The two gunmen made seven people lie down in the bowling
alley's office, shot each in the back of the head, set a fire and
fled with $5,000, police said.
   Two adults and a 12-year-old girl survived and were listed in
serious condition Monday at Memorial General Hospital.
   ``Lately, I've seen an increase in homicides,'' Dona Ana County
Sheriff Cooney Sarracino said Monday, ``but you don't see many
execution-style murders, and this is execution style. I've seen
where three or four people were killed, but not little kids.''
   Police said they have been inundated with hundreds of tips to
aid the search for the gunmen, but no arrests had been made.
   A black bow and ribbon has been placed on the entrance of a
cosmetology school where the 24-year-old Mrs. Teran works. And the
bowling alley marquee urged passersby to pray for the victims.
   At the young victims' schools, officials tried to help
classmates understand the tragedy.
   ``I have lots of wet eyes this morning, especially at the eighth
grade level,'' said Dorris Hamilton, principal of Lynn Middle
School, where Amy Houser and the wounded 12-year-old attended
classes.
   Teran, who had recently graduated from New Mexico State
University with a degree in criminal justice, worked weeknights at
the bowling alley and daytime shifts on weekends. On Saturdays, he
would take his daughter, Valerie, and stepdaughter, Paula, with him
because the couple had trouble finding a baby sitter, Mrs. Teran
said.
   While she decried the senselessness of the killings, Mrs. Teran
thanked the community for its support.
   ``I hope they can put it behind them,'' she said.
   Mrs. Teran said she hopes her children and husband did not
suffer. Police have said the 2-year-old was alive when paramedics
took her from the bowling alley. She was pronounced dead at the
hospital minutes later.
   ``It kills me that I couldn't have been there with her. I just
hope she was not in a lot of pain,'' Mrs. Teran said.
   ``I believe he and my daughters, my girls, they're all in
heaven,'' Mrs. Teran said. ``God has a mission for them. He took
the girls with him because he didn't want to leave them to suffer.''
   A funeral Mass for the Teran family members will be held
Wednesday.

<BYLINE>New Communist Platform: A Bill of Rights _ Protection From the
State</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In its revolutionary new platform, the ruling
Communist Party casts aside Marxist economic theory by accepting
private property and backs a strong presidency that would further
erode its 72-year grip on power.
   The platform advocates a bill of rights to protect the
individual against abuses of the state in a country where Stalinist
authorities stripped millions of peasants of land and had political
opponents murdered by the thousands.
   The document, approved during a landmark meeting last week and
published Monday, represents President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
boldest break with Communist orthodoxy and contradicts public
statements he made just months ago.
   The official Tass news agency said leaders called Monday for a
special session of the Congress of People's Deputies in the ``near
future'' to strength the office of presidency, which would solidify
Gorbachev's hold on power.
   The country's highest executive body, the presidium of the
Supreme Soviet, ``unanimously favored the establishment of
democratic presidential power in our country,'' Tass reported.
   It also said without elaboration that the presidium wanted the
Congress _ which was seated last spring in the country's first
contested elections in seven decades _ to consider the ownership of
property and strengthening the Soviet government. Gorbachev had
called for the Congress to convene in June.
   The statement did not say whether the president should be
directly elected by voters, but one of Gorbachev's key allies _
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze _ said last week that a
nationwide popular election might be possible.
   In deciding on sweeping changes, the platform says the party
took into account the new hunger of citizens for democracy and
reform, as expressed by mass rallies and local political organizing
all over the country.
   The new platform abandons the Communists' ideological roots:
   ``The Communist Party of the Soviet Union believes the existence
of individual property, including ownership of the means of
production, does not contradict the modern stage in the country's
economic development.''
   Marxist theory holds that factories and other means of producing
goods must be owned by the state rather than individuals because
private ownership inevitably results in one person exploiting the
labor of another.
   The platform says state-owned property should be turned over to
worker control through leasing, contracts, joint-stock holdings and
other methods.
   Communists intend to create and economy ``based on a diversity
of property forms, competition between independent manufacturers, a
developed financial system and on the powerful stimuli of personal
and collective interest,'' the platform says.
   At last week's meeting, the Communist Party's policy-making
Central Committee voted to relinquish the party's guaranteed
leading role and accept that it must compete with other parties for
the right to govern.
   The authority of the party, which Gorbachev heads as general
secretary, is in steep decline as citizens angered at mismanagement
and official corruption hold it responsible for the dismal state of
the economy.
   Communist central authority also faces increased challenges from
secessionist movements throughout the restive union and at the
polls, where Communists are expected to show poorly in local
elections this spring.
   Popular revolutions have in the past year thrown out Communist
leaders in Moscow's former Eastern European satellites.
   Central planning has left the Soviet Union unable to provide its
people with adequate food, housing and consumer goods, and the
platform says the system has been ``characterized by monopoly, lack
of initiative, wastefulness, mismanagement and disregard for
consumers interests.''
   The young Soviet state under Lenin's leadership confiscated most
private property after the 1917 revolution, and Stalin's drive to
strip peasants of their land through collectivization in the 1930s
claimed millions of lives through famine, deportation and summary
execution.
   The platform did not make clear in what sense the party still
considers itself to be Communist, but pays homage to the creative
spirit of Marxism and the philospohy's humanistic outlook.
   It said the party is committed to protect ``a citizen's
personality and honor, the immunity of his home and property, the
secrecy of correspondence.''
   The platform backs freedoms of conscience, religion, assembly,
speech, the press and citizen ``participation in running the
affairs of society and the state.''
   Soviet laws long have promised wide political freedoms, but
until Gorbachev came to power in 1985 the Communists dominated
every aspect of life and persecuted critics and potential
challengers.
   In a departure from one of the Marxist slogans once used to
justify rule by terror and liquidation of the middle class, the
party dismissed the concept of a dictatorship of the proletariat,
saying: ``The rule-of-law state of the whole people has no room for
dictatorship by any class.''
   The platform introduces the concept of competition _ once taboo
among Communist ideologists _ as a necessary tool for regulating
prices and ensuring availability of goods and services. It calls
for legislation to break up state monopolies, trade, credit
services and insurance businesses to permit competitive consumer
services.
   As recently as November, Gorbachev stated firm opposition to
permitting Soviet citizens to hold private property.
   But he has changed signals on several issues in recent weeks. In
January, he reversed his longstanding opposition to the party
giving up its guaranteed monopoly on power.
   All constitutional questions, such as powers of the presidency,
must be decided by the Congress, which is supposed to meet briefly
twice a year.
   Under reforms pushed through by Gorbachev in December 1988, the
president is chosen by the Congress.

<HEAD>New Strains in U.S.-Philippine Ties A Prelude To Bases Talks,
Cheney Visit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT H. REID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cutbacks in U.S. economic aid and
rare American criticism of President Corazon Aquino's stewardship
have strained relations with Washington, which helped save her from
military mutineers two months ago.
   The new strains have emerged as the two governments prepare for
talks, possibly next month, on extending the lease on the six U.S.
military bases, which expires next year.
   In the clearest sign of tension, Mrs. Aquino announced Sunday
that she would refuse to meet Defense Secretary Richard Cheney when
he visits the Philippines next week.
   She cited recent statements from American officials, who blamed
the December coup attempt in part on corruption and inefficiency in
her government.
   Mrs. Aquino claims the mutineers were simply trying to ``grab
power'' and that their criticisms had no validity.
   ``I believe I have been a victim of inaccurate reporting, not
from the Philippine press but from the American press,'' Mrs.
Aquino told reporters Monday. ``I believe it is best at this time
to just instruct (Defense) Secretary (Fidel) Ramos on whatever
there is to say to Secretary Cheney.''
   On Dec. 1, U.S. Air Force F-4 Phantom jets flew air cover for
government forces battling mutineers seeking to overthrow Mrs.
Aquino.
   Although the jets never fired a shot, it is widely believed that
U.S. intervention was decisive in defeating the mutiny because of
the psychological impact of such strong American support for Mrs.
Aquino.
   Since the coup attempt, however, U.S. officials have publicly
criticized the Aquino government for failing to curb corruption and
deliver basic services to the country's 58 million people.
   ``The greatest deterrent to future coup attempts will be
forceful, sustained action by the government to address those
grievances shared by the rebels and the populace,'' Deputy
Assistant Secretary of State Carl Ford told the House subcommittee
on Asia and the Pacific last month.
   Commenting on Ford's testimony, Mrs. Aquino said: ``I do not
agree with him on the matter of the grievances of the coup plotters
that they cite graft and corruption and other grievances. All of
the six coup attempts were basically to grab power and not to
submit themselves to the democratic processes.''
   Ford's statement marked a significant departure from what U.S.
diplomats say had been an unofficial policy of never criticizing
Mrs. Aquino publicly.
   Criticism by American officials always makes a significant
impact here. Most Filipinos believe as an article of faith that
Washington orchestrates events in their country and that criticism
signals diminishing U.S. support.
   Adding to the strain was the Bush administration's failure to
fulfill a pledge made during talks in 1988 on allowing Clark Air
Base, the Subic Bay naval base and four smaller installations to
remain through the end of their lease.
   During the talks, then-Secretary of State George Shultz agreed
to seek $962 million in economic aid to the Philippines over two
years.
   This year, the Bush administration asked Congress to provide the
Philippines with $200 million in military assistance and $160
million in economic support. But Congress cut the overall request
by $96 million.
   Any agreement extending the bases beyond 1991 must be approved
by two-thirds of the 23-member Senate. The chamber's president,
Jovito Salonga, suggested talks be postponed until the cuts are
restored.
   On Monday, Rep. Ramon Mitra, speaker of the House of
Representatives, said he would sponsor a resolution urging Mrs.
Aquino to postpone bases talks until the United States restores aid
cuts and halts its ``black propaganda.''

   This just in for Valentine's Day: nine of 10
people in a survey claimed they had never been unfaithful, and four
of five said they would marry the same person again, given the
chance.
   The Gallup survey, commissioned by Psychology Today and two
television shows, King World's Inside Edition and ABC's Home Show,
was released Monday.
   Three of four respondents said their spouse is their best
friend, and 64 percent said their marriage was ``very happy.''
   Pollsters contacted 657 randomly selected, married men and women
nationwide shortly before Christmas. The margin of error was plus
or minus 4 percentage points.
   The report on the findings, by the Rev. Andrew M. Greeley and T.
George Harris, called the widespread belief that married people are
often unfaithful an example of ``pluralistic ignorance _ erroneous,
cognitive beliefs shaped by some individuals about other
individuals.''
   The report also put forth the theory ``the availability of
divorce for those who are unhappy has increased the average level
of happiness in the pool of couples who remain married.''
   The survey attributed marital happiness primarily to three
factors: communication; cooperation in housework, child rearing and
respect of each other's work; and romance. For instance:
   _71 percent said they're trying very hard to improve their
marriage.
   _55 percent of male respondents and 47 percent of female
strongly believe their spouse is romantic.
   _39 percent said they work very hard to improve their sex life.
   _53 percent of women respondents and 47 percent of men strongly
agreed that their spouse is a skilled lover.
   _32 percent of women and 26 percent of men said their spouse is
imaginative about sex.
   The survey found so much bliss in America that 10 percent of the
respondents agreed strongly their spouse is sometimes ``like a
god'' to them. Eighteen percent of women agreed at least somewhat
with the statement _ and 37 percent of men did.
   Other findings:
   _81 percent of men and 72 percent of women strongly believe
their spouse is good looking.
   _82 percent believe their spouse is good with children, and 63
percent strongly disagree that children take the fun out of
marriage.
   _70 percent disagree that as ``the years go on, much of the fun
goes out of marriage.''

<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts from the Soviet Communist Party
Platform adopted by the Central Committee last week and published
by Tass.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>HUMAN RIGHTS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The party seeks to place man in the center of social
development, providing him with worthy living and working
conditions, guaranteeing him social justice, political liberty and
possibilities for comprehensive development and spiritual
fulfillment, and regards this as its main goal. This is exactly
what should determine social progress.
   The Soviet Communist Party stands for the earliest formulation
of legal acts guaranteeing the rights and freedoms of citizens. The
recognition of personal liberty as the key and vital value and an
about-face to guarantee the entire complex of human rights is
perestroika's most important accomplishment. Now it is necessary to
consolidate these rights, to rest them on a solid material, legal
and political foundation.
   The party will uphold:
   _ Reliable legislative protection of a citizen's personality and
honor, the immunity of his home and property, the secrecy of
correspondence and telephone conversations,
   _ Stronger guarantees to realize the right to work, including
payment according to the quantity and quality of work done and its
final results. The formation of a mechanism to maintain employment,
training and re-training of personnel and adequate material support
for those who are forced to change their trade, profession or place
of work,
   _ The development and strengthening of the political rights of
citizens: participation in running the affairs of society and the
state, freedom of speech, the press, meetings and demonstrations
and the formation of public organizations. Law and order and
requirements of Soviet laws should be strictly observed,
   _ Freedom for creative activities and attitude to talent as a
national asset.
   _ Man's free self-determination in the spiritual sphere, the
freedom of conscience and religion. Without abandoning its world
outlook, the party will step up the dialogue between atheists and
believers and pursue a policy that offers all churches the
opportunity to freely operate within the law, contributing to
mutual understanding between people,
   _ A higher role of the court of law in protecting civil rights,
the establishment of public-state commissions exercising
law-enforcing activities,
   The CPSU (Communist Party of the Soviet Union) puts priority on
the adoption of laws in the near future on the press and other mass
media, freedom of conscience and religious associations, public
associations, the order of emigration from and immigration to the
U.S.S.R., Soviet citizenship, languages of Soviet peoples and other
legislative acts that will guarantee the political and personal
rights of citizens...
   Every means envisaged by law should be used to combat crime,
while the presumption of innocence and the right to protection and
juridical norms should be strictly observed.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FOOD AND AGRICULTURE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The solution of the food problem should rest on the development
of all forms of economic management in agriculture. State-run,
cooperative and individual farms and diverse forms of management,
based on contract, leasing and other principles, should be given
equal possibilities.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CONSUMERS AND FINANCE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   We continue to focus on efforts to increase the production of
consumer goods. The CPSU will help implement measures to help
satiate the market.
   The party advocates an effective finance recovery program,
including such measures as the encouragement of deposits in savings
banks at increased interest rates, the development of the insurance
business, the distribution of state loan bonds on advantageous
terms, the selling of dwellings, advance payments by the population
for durable goods they plan to buy in the future and the selling of
stocks and other securities ...
   More flexible economic instruments and quotas will be needed to
prevent unfounded incomes and the issue of money in excess of the
supply of goods.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PROPERTY AND ECONOMY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The CPSU believes the existence of individual property,
including ownership of the means of production, does not contradict
the modern stage in the country's economic development ...
   One of the most difficult aspects of the economic reform is
finding an organic combination of plan and market methods to
regulate economic activity.
   Modern production is impossible without a centralized planned
management. This essentially socialist principle of economic
management has been adopted by many countries.
   However, it is crucially important to determine the precise
degree and methods of such management. Unlike in the past, when the
plan attempted to encompass the entire process of production and
distribution, there is now a need for a procedure in which planned,
centralized economic management will be exercised through prices,
taxes, interest rates, credits, payments etc. ...
   The creation of a full-fledged market economy requires the
formation of markets of consumer products, capital goods,
securities, investment, currencies and research and development,
and an early reform of the financial, monetary and credit systems.
   The restructuring of price formation is a sine qua non condition
for the market to start regulating the economy. The artificial
price levels and proportions, the burden of ineffective subsidies
for some and ruinous deductions from others provide false
reference-points for economic management. They confound the
assessment of management's effect, perpetuate scientific and
technological backwardness and prevent the efficient utilization of
the advantages of the international division of labor.

<TEXT>
   Competition between product manufacturers, including foreign
firms, must become an important factor regulating and restraining
the growth of prices.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ENVIRONMENT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The protection of nature is the protection of man. Toward the
close of the 20th century, environmental protection has become a
categoric imperative for preserving life on the Earth. We must
introduce world standards in this country and take an active part
in international ecological cooperation.
   The rapid industrial growth of the U.S.S.R., coupled with an
attitude of neglect toward conservation measures, has led to grave
pockets of ecological disaster. Urgent measures and large
investments are required to rectify the situation.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SOURCE OF POWER</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The party's policy proceeds from the recognition of the
sovereign will of the people as the only source of power. The
rule-of-law state of the whole people has no room for dictatorship
by any class, and even less so for the power of a management
bureaucracy.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ELECTIONS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The electoral system should be brought in line with the
principles of universal, equal, direct suffrage. We wish elections
to become an honest competition between representatives of all the
sections of society, of individuals and ideas submitted to the
judgment of voters by the party, public organizations and movements
and individual candidates.
   The development of society does not preclude the possibility of
forming parties. The procedure for their formation will be
established by law and reflected in the constitution of the U.S.S.R.
   The formation and activity of organizations and movements that
expound violence and inter-ethnic strife and that pursue extremist,
unconstitutional aims should be prohibited by law.
   The Soviet Communist Party does not claim a monopoly and is
prepared for a political dialogue and cooperation with everyone who
favors the renewal of socialist society.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>STATE AUTHORITY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Communist Party holds that the separation of
legislative, executive and judiciary powers is fundamentally
important to the government's efficiency. In Lenin's words, we
should combine the advantages of the Soviet system with the
advantages of (parliamentary government).
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE PRESIDENCY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The question of instituting the post of head of state _
president _ responsible to the Congress of U.S.S.R. People's
Deputies and having the necessary powers is posed by society ever
more insistently.
   A president is needed to maintain the country's stable
development, to speed up perestroika, to guarantee its
irreversibility, to ensure the normal and effective functioning of
all state and public institutions in the process of
democratization, to ensure law and citizens' security, to protect
the Soviet Union's interests and to represent our state on the
international arena.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DEFENSE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A rule-of-law state presupposes effective political guidance of
the defense, the accountability of the military department to the
supreme civil authorities, and maximum openness in the activity of
the military department, taking into account the level of
confidence among states.
   Internal security. In view of the need to protect state
frontiers, counteract foreign intelligence agencies, protect the
Soviet constitutional system and the rights of citizens, we should
be attentive to the needs of frontier and internal troops, which
fulfill complex and at times dangerous duties.
   Remaining vital to the maintenance of public order, interior and
state security bodies should operate strictly within the law and
under control of elective government bodies.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ETHNIC RELATIONS AND THE RIGHT TO SECEDE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The principle of the self-determination of nations in a renewed
Soviet federation presupposes the freedom of national-state
entities to choose forms by which to structure life, institutions
and symbols of statehood. Our ideal is not unification, but unity
in diversity.
   The party reaffirms its commitment to Lenin's principle of the
right of nations to self-determination, including secession, and
favors the adoption of a law on a mechanism for the exercise of
this right.
   At the same time we are convinced that the weakening and
disruption of reciprocally diverse and interrelated ties could lead
to negative consequences for all peoples, to say nothing about
individual destinies, consequences that are very difficult to
foresee.
   That is why we resolutely oppose separatist slogans and
movements that would lead to the destruction of the great
multi-ethnic democratic state.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PARTY DEMOCRACY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   There is a need for rethinking the principle of democratic
centralism. It should no longer be treated in such a way that it
can be used to implement barrack-room, hierarchical discipline.
   There is no other way to overcome Communists' dissatisfaction
with their role in the policy and activity of the party. There is
no other way to restore in each of them a sense of dignity and
inner-freedom.

   He built a billion-dollar empire of hotels and
real estate, owns a casino and an airline that bear his name, and
wrote a best seller called ``The Art of the Deal.''
   But the art of making a marriage work appears to have eluded
Donald Trump. He and his wife, Ivana, have split after nearly 13
years of marriage _ proving once again that money can't buy you
love.
   In fact, money is a source of contention between the two,
despite a prenuptial agreement under which she was to get custody
of their three children, the Greenwich, Conn., mansion, and $25
million.
   Trump, 43, is worth considerably more _ $1.7 billion to $4
billion, depending on who's counting.
   Ivana's lawyer, Michael Kennedy, issued a statement Monday
saying: ``We do not consider the so-called prenuptial agreement to
be serious. It will have no relevance to a court because it is
unconscionable and fraudulent.''
   In response, Donald's spokesman said: ``The prenuptial agreement
signed by Donald and Ivana Trump is a long and detailed document
which covers all aspects and is 100 percent enforceable in courts
of law. The agreement they have was updated approximately two years
ago. Prior to that, this agreement has been updated on numerous
other occasions throughout the years.''
   While lawyers and image-makers battle it out with press
releases, tabloids and TV stations _ always enamored of the
tuxedoed Trump and the bejeweled, begowned Ivana _ lap it up.
   The New York Post today reported that Donald locked Ivana out of
her office Monday at the Plaza Hotel.
   The Post, citing unidentified sources, also reported that some
of Ivana's jewelry is missing.
   Trump had given her the jobs of running the Plaza and the Trump
Castle in Atlantic City, N.J., for a salary, as he put it, of ``One
dollar plus all the dresses she can buy.''
   It was not clear whether Ivana, a former Czechoslovakian ski
racer and sometime model who turns 41 next week, will continue with
her hotel work.
   On Monday, the Post quoted Donald saying that Ivana's ``level of
arrogance has grown steadily worse in recent years. The bottom line
is I don't want to create another Leona Helmsley.''
   Mrs. Helmsley is the self-described hotel queen recently
convicted of tax evasion; at her trial, former employees described
her as ill-tempered and demanding.
   ``I have told Ivana, `Whatever Leona would do, do the opposite.
Be nice to everybody.' And she is nice, anyway,'' Trump told
Playboy magazine in an interview in the March issue.
   Nice aside, Trump told columnist Liz Smith, who broke the story
of the breakup in Sunday's Daily News: ``It is better for Ivana and
me to separate at this time. But I am leaving because I want to
leave.
   ``Ivana is a wonderful woman and a very good woman and I like
her. We might even get back together. I can't say we won't. ... And
as for those other women I have been linked with, well, I want to
say that we are all just friends and that's as far as it goes,''
Trump said.
   Pictures of those other women were plastered across a page of
the New York Post: actresses Catherine Oxenberg and Marla Maples
and skater Peggy Fleming across the top of a page.
   New York newspapers trotted out _ as evidence of trouble in
Trump paradise _ the story of Ivana, in an Aspen restaurant over
the holidays, reportedly warning Maples, a former Miss Georgia
runnerup and star of a movie called ``Maximum Overdrive,'' to stay
away from Donald. The Trumps were then seen arguing on the slopes.
   A few days later, Maples reportedly told Ivana: ``I love him and
if you don't, why don't you let him go?'' the Post said.

<TEXT>
   Three gun-toting police officers and a
private detective were arrested after confronting a flamboyant
Saudi sheik in a dispute over $14,000 in back wages, authorities
said.
   The four, who had been Sheik Mohammed al-Fassi's bodyguards,
were charged with false imprisonment after they were lured back to
his rented home with a promise of a $5,000 payment, police said.
   Three of the men came to al-Fassi's central Florida home Sunday
armed with pistols; the other was in a car with a sawed-off
shotgun, said Osceola County Sheriff Jon Lane.
   Al-Fassi said one of the men put a gun on a table and hinted
they could harm his children if they were not paid the back wages
they said they were owed for work at the sheik's mansion in Miami
Beach, police said.
   The men left when al-Fassi promised they would be paid by today.
But police decided to set a trap for the four after al-Fassi
complained of being harassed.
   Al-Fassi called North Miami police officer Neal Cuevas, and told
him the four could have $5,000 right away. Deputies staking out the
house arrested the four when they returned later Sunday.
   In addition to Cuevas, 35, the others arrested were officers
Frank Irvine, 32; Vito Santangelo, 40; and private detective Ronald
Raflowitz, 38.
   The men posted bond of $1,000 each. They face a maximum of seven
years in prison if convicted.
   Santangelo was suspended without pay by the South Miami Police
Department. Cuevas and Irvine retained their jobs with the North
Miami police pending further investigation, said North Miami Deputy
Police Chief Donald Sjoland.

   A Marine pilot died after
ejecting during the crash of his AV-8B Harrier attack jet, a Marine
Corps spokesman said.
   Another flier also ejected from a twin-engine reconnaissance
plane that landed safely, and the Marine Corps was investigating
whether the ejections were linked, said Capt. Kevin Murphy.
   Names of the fliers were not released.
   The planes, assigned to the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing in Cherry
Point, N.C., were on training missions at the sprawling desert base
125 miles east of Los Angeles.
   The pilot of the single-seat Harrier ejected Monday morning
before the craft crashed in a remote area, said Murphy.
   The pilot was taken to the Naval Hospital, where he died more
than an hour later, Murphy said.
   At about the time the Harrier pilot ejected, the aerial observer
in a two-seat Marine OV-10 Bronco observation plane ejected.
   The Bronco's pilot landed the plane safely, and the observer who
had ejected was taken to the hospital, where he was in fair
condition under observation, said Murphy.

<DATELINE>ASWAN, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Nations and Egypt have begun a
campaign to rebuild the Alexandria Library, which stored the roots
of Greek and Jewish civilization before its destruction 17
centuries ago.
   In the hotel where Agatha Christie wrote part of ``Death on the
Nile,'' international royalty, politicians and cultural celebrities
gathered Monday to endorse a $90 million fund-raising drive.
   Sheik Zayed Bin Sultan al-Nahyan, president of the United Arab
Emirates, kicked it off with a pledge of $20 million.
   The re-creation of Alexander the Great's library will cost
nearly $150 million, including more than $60 million from Egypt in
the form of equipment and the purchase of the Mediterranean
seafront site.
   Egypt, which owes foreign creditors $50 billion, ``has decided
to carry out this colossal work and give it top priority in spite
of ... the challenge it faces for realizing comprehensive economic
reform,'' President Hosni Mubarak said.
   ``Egypt can never relinquish its pioneer civilizational role,
which it should play by virtue of its history and location,''
Mubarak said. ``This is what the world expects of (Egypt).''
   The general director of the U.N. Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization, Egypt's co-sponsor for the project, admitted
the cost is high but said fostering knowledge, ``the supreme
resource,'' is worth it.
   ``There are those who will say $150 million is a high price to
pay ... when so many apparently more pressing needs clamor for our
attention,'' said Federico Mayor, a Spaniard.
   ``Are we to place a lower value on a library than on a
superbomber? At a time when the disarmament momentum is growing,
the promotion of knowledge deserves to be one of the first peace
dividends.''
   Construction is scheduled to begin on the mammoth library
complex late this year, with completion in mid-1995. The complex
will cover 722,000 square feet, including 277,800 square feet for
the 10-story library itself. Museums, a planetarium, a center for
book and manuscript preservation and related facilities are planned.
   Mubarak's wife, Suzanne, who is leading the project, said it
``concerns every man, everywhere, no matter his geographical
position, political affiliation or religious creed.''
   The original Bibliotheca Alexandrina thrived for centuries as a
seat of scientific, cultural and academic lore. It was in
Alexandria that Euclid thrived, Jewish scholars translated the Old
Testament from Hebrew into Greek and Homer's works were collected.
   Well-established by 285 B.C., the library's 500,000 volumes
remained at the heart of Mediterranean academic life until it was
destroyed in a series of fires in wartime and riots.
   The destruction was so complete that its site and design still
are debated.
   President Francois Mitterrand of France, Princess Caroline of
Monaco and Greek actress Melina Mercouri also attended Monday's
session at the Old Cataract Hotel.

   President Bush is urging Congolese President
Denis Sassou-Nguesso to keep promoting peace in Angola and praising
him for ``the growing health of free markets and free ideas'' in
the Congo.
   At a state dinner Monday night honoring the president of the
People's Republic of the Congo, Bush said Sassou had helped make
Southern Africa ``a more peaceful and stable place.
   ``Namibia will soon be independent. The new beginnings in South
Africa may help end an old evil, apartheid,'' said Bush. ``And in
Angola, as Cuban troops are leaving, our search for national
reconciliation has intensified.''
   He urged Sassou to use his ``respected voice'' to pursue peace
and self-determination for the people in Angola.
   Bush said the Congo, once closely aligned with Moscow, ``has
taken some welcome steps, encouraging private enterprise, placing
some limits on the power of single-party rule and opening the
legislature to non-party groups.''
   Bush raised a glass to toast Sassou's health, success and ``the
growing health of free markets and free ideas in your homeland.''
   Sassou applauded Bush's role in leading the world to a more
peaceful era, saying, ``History will note that the U.S.-USSR
dialogue of the 90s helped sketch out the 21st century.''

<HEAD>Pool of School Volunteers Changing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The old image of school volunteers raising
money with bake sales and coaching sports teams needs to be
broadened to include business executives and retirees who do
everything from tutoring to counseling.
   On the other hand, the National Research Council study issued
Monday also found that public schools with high minority enrollment
use few, if any, volunteers of any type.
   ``Volunteers in Public Schools'' found that some 1.3 million
people were school volunteers during the 1987-88 school year. About
60 percent of public schools and 65 percent of private schools
reported having volunteers.
   ``Twenty to 30 years ago most school volunteers were mothers of
school children, but this source has been reduced as women have
moved into paid employment,'' the study said.
   ``Increasingly, people from the business community, retired
citizens and college students have been actively recruited by
school systems, and these groups now constitute a substantial
portion of volunteers.''
   Public schools with high minority enrollment _ 50 percent or
more _ were less likely to use volunteers and reported fewer on
average than did schools with lower minority enrollment, said the
study.

   President Bush, sporting the Silver Buffalo
scouting medallion around his neck, says Boy Scouting teaches
``lessons that last a lifetime.''
   At a White House ceremony Monday honoring scouting's 80th
anniversary, Bush was presented the National Boy Scouts
Organization's highest award, the Silver Buffalo, and wore during
his brief remarks.
   The president said he was observing a tradition ``that dates all
the way back to 1910, when President Taft received the first Boy
Scout delegation right here in the White House.''
   ``Scouting is more than learning how to build a campfire or tie
a knot,'' Bush told a group of scouts and their leaders.
   ``Scouting teaches a love of outdoors and appreciation of our
environment; it teaches the spirit of serving others and self
respect. And let me make it pure and simple: It teaches lessons
that last a lifetime.''
   Bush was given the Silver Buffalo medallion as well as the first
copy of the new edition of the Boy Scout Handbook, which scout
leaders said is second only to the Bible in terms of copies printed.

<HEAD>Three Girls Make History By Joining The Scouts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARK, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three girls looking for more strenuous
hikes, bike rides and rock climbing have signed up with the Scouts,
breaking an all-boys tradition in British scouting that dates from
its foundation in 1908.
   ``I am really thrilled that we are being allowed to join at
last,'' said Nicola Lowes, a former Girl Guide, as she and two
friends signed membership certificates Monday night.
   ``We have nothing against the Guides but we found it a bit
tame,'' 14-year-old Nicola told reporters in Wark, a village in
northeast England.
   The move follows the decision announced Thursday by Britain's
chief scout, Garth Morrison, to admit girls.
   Nicola, Christel Wilson, 15, and Gillian Ridley, 14, applied to
join the Wark Scout troop in October. Nicola said they were
``looking forward to playing tough games with the boys and going on
hikes, rock climbing, bike rides and all the things the lads do.''
   Bob Hogarth, leader of the Wark troop, said he and the 12 boys
in the troop aged 10 to 15 favored having them in, but the girls
were rejected because of the all-boys rule.
   Geoff Richardson, the region's Scout commissioner, said that
like boys who join, the girls will have to undergo basic training
before being invested as full members.
   Morrison said on Thursday that it would be left to each local
Scout troop to decide whether to admit girls. He described it as
``an important move and a move in the right direction.''
   Dr. June Paterson-Brown, chief commissioner of Britain's Girl
Guides Association, said the move made her angry. ``If they try to
poach our girls, then it will make things very difficult.''
   The Boy Scouts of America movement has allowed girls aged
between 6 and 15 in its Explorer Division for about 19 years.
   Lord Baden-Powell, the British soldier who founded the Scout
movement with his 1908 manual ``Scouting for Boys,'' originally
envisaged it as a body of young lookouts to keep an enemy under
surveillance.

<HEAD>Silber Defends Remarks About Racism Among Jews</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic gubernatorial candidate John R. Silber
sparked protests from Jewish organizations after saying he
encountered racism among Jews when he once considered converting.
   In an article in The Boston Sunday Globe, Silber, who is on
leave as president of Boston University, said he considered
converting to Judaism in 1948, but decided against it because of
their treatment of converts.
   ``I thought about it, and then found out that the racism of Jews
is quite phenomenal,'' Silber told the newspaper last week.
   ``If you are goyim considering becoming a Jew, you are going to
be second-class in that synagogue, and I didn't have any interest
at all in moving into that congregation as a second-class citizen.''
   In a statement Monday, Silber attempted to explain his comments
and said, ``I have never suggested that Judaism is racist.''
   But Jewish leaders decried Silber's comments.
   ``What may have been true of his own experience in 1948 with a
certain number of Jews in a particular congregation can hardly be
accepted as the basis for a generalization,'' said Leonard Zakim,
executive director of the New England chapter of the
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith.
   However, Zakim conceded that while Silber's words might have
been ill-chosen, the comments do not diminish the candidate's work
on behalf of the Jewish people.
   ``I don't think it changes the fact of his friendship toward the
Jewish community and Israel,'' Zakim said.
   Joel Reck, president of the Jewish Community Relations Council
of Greater Boston, said Silber ``is, and has always been, close to
and a friend and supporter of Jews, Judaism and Israel.''
   Silber, who after 1948 discovered his father was Jewish, was
deterred from joining a synagogue by ``the reluctance of members of
that congregation to accept him because his mother was not
Jewish,'' his statement said Monday.
   ``Nothing in that experience diminished my deep respect for
Judaism and my concern, affection and support for the Jewish people
and for Israel, a concern that has been demonstrated with
consistency throughout my adult life,'' the statement said.
   But state Rep. David B. Cohen, president of the New England
region of the American Jewish Congress, protested Silber's comments.
   ``Any time anyone characterizes members of an ethnic or
religious group with a broad-brush generality, he is engaging in
just that type of stereotyping and prejudice that we are trying to
remove from the American political scene. ... I am astonished,
disturbed and disappointed that the term racism was used in this
context,'' Cohen said.
   Lawrence D. Lowenthal, executive director of the local American
Jewish Committee, said Silber's remarks about Jews ``are simply
blatant insults to the Jewish community.''

<HEAD>Search Teams Hunt for Four Skiers Believed Buried in Avalanche</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANFF, Alberta (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hopes dimmed for four cross-country skiers
feared buried in a massive avalanche two days ago as about 50
people set out today to search a half-mile stretch of deep show.
   ``It looks pretty bleak,'' Bob Haney, chief warden for Banff
National Park, said Monday after a day of ground and aerial
surveillance led rescuers to areas deemed remotely possible where
they could have been.
   ``They indicated quite a number of places,'' Haney said. ``We
dug down with no positive results. It all brings us back to this
one massive slide path.''
   Officials called Sunday's avalanche one of the largest in recent
history.
   Monday's search was hampered by snow driven by a biting wind
that sent temperatures plunging. Four tracking dogs searched a
6-mile-long trail for any scent of the four along the slopes about
50 miles west of Calgary.
   ``The avalanche path itself looked like a lunar landscape with
some snow slabs the size of my truck,'' said reporter Chris Dawson
of the Calgary Herald. ``It was an absolutely sobering experience.
I can tell you my heart was in my throat.''
   The searchers expected to advance short distances today and
shove long, thin, high-tension rods into the snow until they reach
ground level or strike a body.
   The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said the missing skiers were
Charles Coombes, 55, a physics professor at the University of
Calgary; his wife, Clara, 56; Verne Powell, 49, an engineer with
TransAlta Utilities; and Charles Lorenzo, 58, a composing room
employee at the Calgary Herald.
   A fifth person, Lilie Collins, 50, turned back before the
avalanche because of fatigue.

<TEXT>
   Gen. Michel Aoun called up reserve forces
today in apparent preparation for an assault to overrun part of the
Christian enclave north of Beirut and cripple a rival Christian
militia.
   Aoun's gunners and militiamen of Samir Geagea's Lebanese Forces
dueled with howitzers and mortars in east Beirut and the
snow-blanketed mountains northeast of the capital in the 15th day
of the intra-Christian showdown.
   The Lebanese Red Cross committee issued radio appeals for urgent
blood donations and police reported early in the day that rescuers
removed 18 rotting corpses from east Beirut streets.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named in line with
regulations, said nine people were killed and 22 wounded in the
fighting today between Aoun's fighters and Geagea's militiamen in
east Beirut and Kesrouan province.
   By police count the overall toll stood at 498 killed and 1,724
wounded since the struggle began Jan. 30 for domination of the
310-square-mile Christian enclave.
   Geagea, in an interview with the Arabic service of Radio Monte
Carlo, said Monday he had talked to Aoun by telephone and asked for
peace negotiaions.
   ``I told the general that we should negotiate to put an end to
this useless war, but I cannot accept to be annihilated,'' Geagea
said. He did not say when the conversation took place.
   The command of Aoun's estimated 19,000-strong army, in a
communique, called up reservists and volunteers who received
training in the use of weapons during a six-month confrontation
with the Syrians last summer.
   The additional fighters, the communique said, will be
``immediately armed to join their units.'' It did not give further
details.
   Aoun is believed to have a reserve force of about 2,000 retired
military personnel in addition to a 4,000 volunteer-reserve
fighters.
   Beirut's prestigious An-Nahar newspaper said the intra-Christian
confrontation was heading for a ``swift, conclusive battle.''
   It said Aoun wanted to overrun the Kesrouan province, a
traditional stronghold for Geagea's 6,000-strong militia, to seize
the harbor facilities and Central Bank offices in Jounieh, 12{
miles from Beirut.
   Military sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, also said
Aoun appeared determined to dislodge Geagea's militia from its main
power base in Kesrouan.
   One source said Aoun's gunners were maintaining artillery
barrages and a series of hit-and-run attacks against the militia in
Kesrouan to run down their enemy's ``ammunition and effort before
the major battle.''
   There have been no significant gains in territory since the
confrontation shifted to the Kesrouan province on Saturday, the
source noted.
   Police reported civilians were fleeing the mountain resorts of
Ajaltoun, Bekfaya and Daraya despite heavy snows to escape the
battle everybody seems to expect.
   President Elias Hrawi appealed Monday to the superpowers, France
and the Vatican to support possible intervention by his
Syrian-backed troops to halt the fighting.
   Hrawi made a similar appeal last week. Beirut newspapers said
Pope John Paul II and France, traditional protector of Lebanon's
Christians, warned against Syrian military intervention.
   Aoun does not recognize Hrawi's Christian-Moslem government,
which is backed by Syria. He also has vowed to drive the Syrians,
who support the Moslem militias of west Beirut, from Lebanon.

<HEAD>Teachers to Leave Classrooms to Press Salary Demands</HEAD>

<DATELINE>OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Washington teachers are
pressing for higher salaries with a one-day walkout today, while
the governor expressed sympathy but rejected a pay boost this
winter.
   About 200,000 students faced a winter's day off with the planned
walkout by by 13,000 teachers in 35 of the state's 296 school
districts. Eight thousand other teachers pledged to attend
after-hour rallies and marches.
   A similar stalemate is developing in West Virgina, where
thousands of teachers have said they would leave their classrooms
Thursday to protest low wages and education funding despite the
governor's stand the state has no money for them.
   In Washington state, Seattle's 43,000 students were among those
facing a day off. The protest was mostly confined to western
Washington, but teachers everywhere were angry over Gov. Booth
Gardner's decision to ignore the organization's request for
immediate 10 percent pay increases, union officials said Monday.
   ``We want the public to understand we're reaching a crisis point
in Washington,'' said Teresa Moore, spokeswoman for the
49,000-member Washington Education Association.
   But a group called Citizens United for Better Education
denounced the walkouts.
   ``I don't think it sets a good example for a third grader when
their teacher is standing on the street corner chanting, `Hell, no,
we want more,''' said Fred Brown, president of the
Woodinville-based group.
   The Legislature approved a two-step pay boost of 10 percent last
year. The union wants another 10 percent _ a retroactive 6 percent
for this school year and 4 percent in the fall.
   Such an increase would cost about $225 million, which union
officials said could be financed by a $611 million state budget
surplus.
   Gardner, a Democrat who has called himself ``the education
governor,'' told a rally of about 250 school board members and
school administrators Monday that he is committed to developing a
world-class education system.
   But he said the state budget surplus is a one-time phenomenon,
and nothing on which to base continuing salary increases.
   Gardner said he wants to keep one third of the windfall in
reserve, spend one third on children's programs such as school
improvements and hiring more child protective services workers and
use the rest to cover other needs such as as cost increases in
social programs and general government.
   But the union said teacher salaries should be a priority.
   ``Salaries have dropped from fourth in the nation a few years
ago to 21st today,'' Moore said. ``That has an impact on national
competitiveness, the ability to keep good teachers, and also an
impact on how we can attract new people into the profession.''
   The average teacher is being paid about $33,100, plus $2,100 in
supplemental pay for extra chores, acording to the governor's
Office of Financial Management. Starting pay is about $18,000.
   In West Virginia, at least 2,400 union teachers in five counties
had voted by Monday night to walk out Thursday for a rally at the
Capitol. Union teachers in nine other counties also voted to walk
out, but their numbers were not known.
   ``The momentum is growing,'' said West Virginia Education
Association Vice President Jennie Shaffer.
   West Virginia's 22,000 teachers earn an average of $21,904 a
year, which ranks 48th nationally, according to union leaders. Gov.
Gaston Caperton has not included a pay raise in his 1990-91 budget.
   ``The governor has said over and over and over again'' that
there is no money for teacher raises in 1990-91, spokesman G.C.
Morse said Monday night. ``There's gotta be a point where people
realize we're not making this up.''
   But Mary Carden, president of the Boone County Education
Association, said: ``There's a myth that the state is broke, and
we're not buying into it. ... We've had two governors who said they
wanted to help education and they haven't done it.''

<HEAD>Arctic Air Chills West, Midwest; Alaskan Cold Snap Ends</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The seven-week warm streak in the West and Plains shattered
today as arctic air drove temperatures far below the record-setting
readings set earlier this week. The southern Plains, Southeast and
Gulf states, however, looked for the heat to continue.
   Temperatures along the front range of the northern Rockies were
predicted to fall by as much as 50 degrees and tumble to below zero
today in the upper Midwest.
   Alaska enjoyed a warming trend today as an 18-day cold snap
ended with cloudiness and higher temperatures spreading across the
state. Temperatures within the Arctic Circle were expected to rise
above zero for the first time since the third week of January.
   Today's forecast called for cold, moist winds to dump snow from
Montana to northeastern Colorado and parts of Nebraska. Mountain
snow was predicted today for parts of California, Washington, Utah
and Idaho.
   The arctic front cooled avalanche threats in Washington's
Cascades and flood threats on the Chehalis River.
   The Northeast should be cloudy, windy and warmer today. Some
snow may precede a warm front into New England.
   The eastern Great Lakes looked for colder weather and showers,
with rain turning to ice. Flurries were predicted around Lake
Superior's snow belt.
   Balmy weather prevailed in the nation's midsection on Monday,
with 20 cities _ including seven in Iowa _ setting record highs for
the date.
   Temperatures soared into the 70s as far north as Nebraska and
Iowa. Minneapolis, Minn., eclipsed the previous high of 47 degrees
with a reading of 59.
   High winds were expected today in parts of Nevada and in
Southern California's mountains and deserts.
   Clouds draped much of the north-central and western states. Snow
fell from the Pacific Northwest to the northern and central Rockies.
   The high for the nation Monday was 87 degrees at Laredo, Texas.

   The dollar rose in early European trading today.
Gold prices were mixed.
   Foreign currency dealers said the dollar was benefiting from the
West German mark's weakness. The mark has been depressed by
uncertainty over prospects of a West German-East German monetary
union, which dealers fear would weaken the currency.
   ``The big news about opening the frontier between East and West
Germany, which caused the mark to strengthen so rapidly, is already
out,'' said one trader in Milan, Italy.
   ``Now the tough questions are ahead. The question of monetary
union has tremendous problems attached ... It's natural that the
mark has weakened a bit, and that the dollar has taken some of its
strength.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.24 yen to a closing 144.48 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 144.65 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday:

   _ 1.5035 Swiss francs, up from 1.4960

   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound, and was

   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $420.40 a troy ounce, up
from $419.50 bid late Monday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $419.75.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $419.60, up from $419 late Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $5.17 to close at a bid $419.58.

<HEAD>Jury: Monsanto Not Liable for Toxic Waste Site</HEAD>

   Jurors cleared Monsanto Co. of any liability in a
lawsuit brought by more than 200 homeowners who feared chemical
waste dumped by the company near their homes endangered their
health.
   ``I just don't believe this. I'm in shock,'' said Judy Romeo,
who abandoned her home of four years about five months ago. ``I'm
going to go home and have a good cry.''
   The 222 homeowners sought $355 million in damages from Monsanto,
which is the chief user of the Brio Waste Site near their
subdivision. The plaintiffs asked for $1.6 million each, which they
said was equivalent to Monsanto's daily profit margin.
   But jurors in the unanimous verdict Monday said the plaintiffs
had failed to show that it was unsafe to live in the Southbend
subdivision southeast of Houston.
   ``It was a very, very difficult decision,'' said jury foreman
Alfred Morales. ``I would have to say that there was lack of
evidence, in my opinion, that we were looking at.''
   Juror Jim Stecker said, ``I believe that it is safe to live out
there.''
   Homeowner Herb Bateman disagreed. He said he moved his family
from the subdivision in August because, ``We felt our lives and our
children's lives were in danger.''
   Michael Waldeck, an attorney for the homeowners, said he would
appeal.
   The jury's verdict came after nearly a week of deliberations and
four months of testimony in state district court.
   The homeowners said the Brio waste site has led to medical
problems ranging from upset stomachs to headaches. Some residents
testified they feared contracting cancer in the future because they
live so close to the waste site.
   Monsanto denied responsibility for any injuries, saying it is
one of many companies that has used the dump site.

<HEAD>Seven Reported Dead in Tadzhikistan, Trouble Spreads to Suburbs</HEAD>

   Soviet soldiers and armored vehicles controlled
the center of Tadzhikistan's capital today but rioting that claimed
the lives of seven people and injured scores was spreading to the
suburbs, a journalist reported.
   Rioting broke out in the central Asian republic's capital of
Dushanbe on Monday after rumors spread that Armenian refugees from
ethnic violence in the Caucasus were being given preference for new
housing at the expense of natives.
   The rioters smashed windows and set fire to the ground floor of
the republic's Communist Party headquarters and attacked stores and
passers-by, said Anatoly Larenov, a correspondent for the national
newspaper Vozdushny Transport.
   Seven people were killed and 79 hospitalized with injuries, he
said.
   Musafar Madzhidov, correspondent for official radio and
television in Dushanbe, said rioting broke out after two rallies in
a 24-hour period prompted by the rumors of preferential housing.
   Members of the crowd shouted, ``Down with the Armenians,'' he
said.
   The Soviet news agency Tass reported Monday night that a state
of emergency was declared in the city to quell ``mass disorders and
pogroms, and acts of arson and looting.'' It said a 10 p.m. to 6
a.m. curfew was imposed.
   It was the latest violent flare-up in ethnic unrest that has
spread throughout the Soviet Union's southern rim in recent months
as Moscow loosens control and allows nationalist mass movements to
gain strength and challenge Communist authorities.
   Larenov said in a telephone interview that the center of
Dushanbe was quiet today after the curfew ended for the night.
   Tanks and soldiers were stationed in front of the party
headquarters, banks and other institutions, and the center of the
city was under military control.
   But he said trouble was spreading to the suburbs of Dushanbe, a
city of more than 500,000 people.
   Larenov said officials had evacuated Armenian families before
the trouble started Monday, and that most of the anger was directed
at Russian-speaking people. A list of those killed did not appear
to include any Armenian names.
   Armenians, a predominantly Christian people, have been involved
for the last two years in bloody dispute with predominantly Moslem
Azerbaijanis over control of the Nagorno-Karabakh region of
Azerbaijan.
   More than 200 people have been killed in the southern Caucasus
republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan since Jan. 13. President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev sent thousands of soldiers into the area to
end a nationalist revolt in the Azerbaijani capital of Baku and end
attacks on Armenians.
   Until Monday, there had been no reports that the trouble had
spread to the predominantly Moslem republics of Soviet Central Asia
such as Tadzhikistan.
   Madzhidov said that Tadzhikistan's Communist Party leader,
Kakhar Makhkamov, appeared before a crowd that gathered Sunday
outside party headquarters in Dushanbe and asked for 24 hours to
investigate rumors Armenian refugees had been guaranteed housing in
new suburbs while Tadzhiks were kept waiting.
   Another crowd gathered on Monday, but ignored his report that
all but one Armenian refugee already had left Dushanbe, he said by
telephone.
   They pelted the party headquarters with stones, breaking all the
windows, and then went on a rampage through shops located nearby,
he said.
   Police fired in the air to disperse the crowd, but the rioting
continued until armored vehicles brought soldiers into the city
center, Madzhidov said.
   Families in Tadzhikistan, a small mountainous republic bordering
China and Afghanistan, traditionally are large, and there is a
critical shortage of housing. Some of the mainly Moslem Tadzhiks
also remain homeless after an earthquake in the republic in January
1989 that killed scores of people.

   Here are some facts and figures about Tadzhikistan:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE LAND _ Tadzhikistan covers 55,240 square miles, bordered on
the north by Uzbekistan and the Kirghiz republic, the east by
Chinese Turkestan and the south by Afghanistan. Its huge mountain
glaciers are the source of many rapid rivers and the republic
contains rich pasture lands.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE _ Nearly 60 percent of the republic's 4.8 million
residents are Tadzhiks who speak an Iranian dialect little
different from Persian, but most Tadzhiks are Sunni Moslems, not
Shiites like the Iranians. About 23 percent of the people are
Uzbeks, who live in the northwest, and 10.5 percent are Russian or
Ukrainian.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ECONOMY _ The major occupations are farming, horticulture
and cattle breeding, but large industrial enterprises have been
established that include mining and textile factories. Tadzhikistan
produces apricots, olives, figs, olives, pomegranates and many
other kinds of fruit. The Gissar sheep is famous for its meat and
fat, and the Karakul for its wool.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ Tadzhiks are considered the descendants of the
original Aryan population of Turkestan. The Tadzhik Soviet
Socialist Republic was formed from those regions of Bokhara and
Turkestan where most of the population was Tadzhik, and became part
of the Soviet Union on Dec. 5, 1929.

<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House of Delegates has given
preliminary approval to a bill to restrict smoking, despite some
legislators' fears of the political consequences in this
tobacco-growing state.
   ``Seldom in my career have I built my own political gallows and
provided the rope,'' Delegate Charles Hawkins, a Republican from
Pittsylvania County, said Monday. ``If I vote for this, I might be
doing that.''
   The bill, which was passed in a voice vote Monday and is due for
a final House vote Tuesday, was approved over the objection of
health lobbyists and legislators who backed a bill calling for
stricter smoking regulation.
   If it's approved in the final House vote, the bill would have to
be reconciled with a more stringent bill recently approved by the
Senate.
   ``We're in a position to negotiate, which is better than
nothing,'' said Sen. Thomas J. Michie Jr., who sponsored the Senate
bill.
   In addition to requiring no-smoking areas in government
buildings, the bill's main impact would set standards for local
no-smoking ordinances.
   Local governments would be allowed to demand no-smoking areas in
restaurants and ban smoking in elevators, schools, indoor service
lines and school buses.
   But local ordinances could not regulate smoking in businesses
with less than 10,000 square feet of floor space _ so-called mom
and pop stores. Nor could they regulate smoking in privately owned
meeting rooms, in theaters or on public transportation.
   The bill also does not address smoking in private work areas.
   A rejected rival bill, similar to that already approved by the
Senate, would have allowed workers to declare their areas
smoke-free by a two-thirds vote.

<TEXT>
   New American Bar Association resolutions
passed over Justice Department objections would restrict the
ability of federal investigators to subpoena lawyers or talk to
their clients.
   The resolutions dealing with the sensitive area of
attorney-client privilege were passed on voice votes Monday at the
ABA's midyear meeting in Los Angeles.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh dispatched Deputy Attorney
General Donald B. Ayer to appeal to the delegates to vote down the
resolution. But ABA officials said the 11th-hour lobbying came only
after the Justice Department refused for more than a year to
discuss the issues.
   The resolutions were the result of increased concern among the
nation's lawyers that federal prosecutors and criminal
investigators are violating the confidential relationship between
attorneys and clients.
   One resolution called for the Justice Department to obtain court
approval before issuing grand jury subpoenas for attorneys.
   Such subpoenas must be authorized by senior Justice Department
officials and have become more frequent over the last decade with
the increased investigation of white-collar crime and drug
trafficking.
   A second resolution criticized a memorandum issued last June by
Thornburgh that says federal prosecutors and agents investigating a
case may talk to people represented by counsel without getting the
permission of the lawyer.
   The ABA says this practice violates its Model Code of
Professional Responsibility as well as many state and local bar
ethics codes.
   The attorney general disputed that and said the Justice
Department would resist attempts by state and local bar groups to
impose ethics regulations ``to curb legitimate federal law
enforcement techniques.''
   Thornburgh argued that the ABA's restrictive interpretation of
the code of conduct could hamper legitimate law enforcement
efforts, such as contacts by Justice Department lawyers
investigating procurement fraud and employees of defense
contractors.
   ``A restrictive application of these local bar rules would
enable company counsel to control the government's access to the
company's employees,'' the attorney general wrote.
   The ABA report adopted along with the resolution said
Thornburgh's policy ``presents a substantive and substantial threat
to the administration of justice.''
   ``Suffice it to say, I don't agree with that characterization,''
Thornburgh told reporters in Washington before the ABA vote.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said the resolutions
would ``have no immediate impact, and our views hold.''
   The Justice Department would wage a state-by-state fight against
any changes in the ethics code to inhibit federal prosecutors.
   On the issue of attorney subpoenas, Ayer told delegates in a
letter the resolution ``would substantially impede criminal
investigations.''
   ``The more difficult we make it to obtain unprivileged
information from attorneys, the more criminal enterprises will seek
out and hide behind unwitting or unscrupulous lawyers,'' Ayer wrote.
   Michael Ross, chairman of the ABA's grand jury section, said the
Justice Department sought a last-minute meeting to discuss the
issue after refusing to do so for 18 months.
   ``The war on drugs has convinced the government that the only
constituency it has to answer to is the man on the street,'' said
Ross, a former federal prosecutor who practices criminal defense
law in New York City.
   ``The man on the street doesn't care about individual rights but
cares about, understandably, the horrors that drugs bring with
it,'' he said.
   ``Clearly, attorney subpoenas will not solve the drug problem,''
Ross said. ``Clearly, ethics rules won't solve the drug problem.
But the guy on the street feels this is a get-tough policy.''

<HEAD>Newspaper: FBI Seized Bomb Materials</HEAD>
<DATELINE>REX, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   FBI agents seized items that could be used to
make a pipe bomb such as those that killed a federal judge and
civil rights lawyer during a search of property owned by a man
convicted 18 years ago of possessing a similar bomb, a newspaper
reported.
   The Atlanta Constitution quoted federal sources it did not
identify in today's editions as saying laboratory tests are pending
to establish whether the items found on the property of Walter
Leroy Moody Jr. match the two bombs that exploded in December.
   Moody denied any connection with the bombs, his lawyer said.
   The bombs sent through the mail killed U.S. Circuit Court Judge
Robert Vance in Alabama and lawyer Robert Robinson of Savannah, Ga.
Two other bombs were safely intercepted.
   Investigators confiscated 2{-inch pipe, six-penny nails, rubber
bands, alarm wire, flashlight bulbs, bolts, paper clips,
gunpowder-packed bullets and welding machinery _ all similar to
items used to make the mail bombs, the newspaper said.
   Also seized were adhesives, brown paper, labels, tape and
``old'' string, the paper reported. Similar materials _
particularly a unique string that has not been manufactured for
about seven years _ were used on the packages in which the four
bombs were mailed.
   The Constitution, in a story also copyrighted by The Atlanta
Journal, reported that agents seized the following:
   _Seventeen 25-cent ``flag over Yosemite'' postage stamps in the
pocketbook of Susan McBride, who lives with Moody. That stamp was
used on all four package bombs.
   _A desktop copier. Photocopied, typewritten letters from a
purported group calling itself ``Americans for a Competent Federal
Judicial System'' were sent after the bombings.
   _Highlighted newspaper clippings about the FBI's investigation
of Robert Wayne O'Ferrell, an Enterprise, Ala., junk-store owner
whose home and business were searched last month and who has been
questioned repeatedly. O'Ferrell denies any knowledge of the bomb
attacks.
   _Two typewriters that were examined on the scene and determined
not to match the ones used by ``Americans for a Competent Federal
Judicial System.''
   Moody, reached at his Clayton County home, referred inquiries to
his attorney, Michael C. Ford.
   ``I don't see anything there that I see as significant,'' Ford
said of the seized items. ``They found brown paper. Well, I hope
they don't search my office. I probably have some of that, too.''
   Ford said two motions were filed in federal court Monday seeking
the return of Moody's property and attacking the searches as
faulty. He said Moody has no connection to the bomb attacks.
   Moody, 55, a self-employed literary consultant, was convicted in
1972 of possessing a pipe bomb that the newspaper's sources said is
very similar to the December package bombs. He was acquitted on a
charge of building the bomb, which injured his then-wife, Hazel, in
their Macon, Ga., home.
   In his appeals in that case, court records show Moody was
extremely critical of the attorney, judges and government agents
associated with his case.
   During an interview Friday with WSB-TV, Moody said,
``Criticizing the court is not an unhealthy practice, I don't
think. I think it's unhealthy when you say, `If you don't rule my
way, then I'm going to send you a bomb.' That's ridiculous.''
   Moody served nearly three years in the Atlanta Federal
Penitentiary on the bomb possession conviction but maintains his
innocence. He is representing himself in asking the U.S. Supreme
Court to throw out his conviction after an 11th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals panel denied his third appeal in June. Vance was not on
that panel.

<TEXT>
   Retail sales, driven by renewed automobile
sales incentives, climbed 1.6 percent in January, the steepest
increase in more than a year, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said sales increased to a seasonally
adjusted $146.4 billion after declining a revised 0.2 percent in
December during what analysts described as modest holiday shopping.
   The January gain was the sharpest since a 2.1 percent advance in
October 1988.
   December sales originally had been reported to have gained 0.2
percent. A drop in estimated auto sales accounted for the decline.
Overall sales in November rose 0.7 percent.
   Retailing usually slows in January because of the previous
month's activity. Half or more of retail profits come from business
between Thanksgiving and Christmas.
   Retail sales account for about one-third of the nation's
economic activity and thus are a barometer of economic growth. The
economy, particularly the construction and manufacturing sectors,
has been squeezed by high interest rates as the Federal Reserve
kept a tight rein on credit to cap inflation.
   The automobile industry, slowed by the high rates and rising
prices on 1990 models, reinstituted rebates on many models last
month to lure buyers to dealer showrooms.
   Commerce said auto sales gained 5.4 percent in January after
falling 2.6 percent in December. It was the largest advance since a
6.6 percent increase in October 1988. Autos represent about 20
percent of retail sales.
   Excluding autos, retail sales for the month would have risen 0.6
percent.
   The overall durable goods category _ including cars and other
big-ticket items expected to last more than three years _ gained
3.9 percent after declining 2.1 percent in December.
   Buildings materials advanced 2.3 percent, while furniture and
other home furnishings rose 2 percent.
   Sales of non-durable goods such as food and clothing edged up
0.3 percent.
   Gains were posted by gasoline stations, up 2.5 percent; drug
stores, up 2.3 percent; department stores, up 2.2 percent, and
restaurants and bars, up 1.5 percent.
   Declines included grocery stores, down 0.4 percent, and apparel,
down 0.7 percent.
   For the three months from November through January, overall
retail sales were up 3.8 percent.

<TEXT>
   A prominent surgeon who took exception to
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's disapproval of an
artificial heart says a modified order allowing last-resort use may
save lives.
   FDA officials ``are reasonable people; I think they came up with
a reasonable decision,'' said Dr. Jack G. Copeland, who heads the
heart transplant and artificial heart programs at University
Medical Center.
   Last month, the FDA withdrew its approval for use of Symbion
Inc.'s total artificial heart both as a permanent implant and as a
temporary bridge to transplantation, saying there were ``serious
deficiencies'' with its manufacture. The federal agency also
withdrew its approval for use of the Tempe, Ariz., company's acute
ventricular assist device.
   The artificial heart was developed by Dr. Robert Jarvik and
initially was called the Jarvik-7. Jarvik no longer is associated
with Symbion, which markets the artificial heart as the Symbion-7.
   The university said in a statement Monday that the FDA ``will
not object to the use of the Symbion devices as a last resort after
all alternative treatments with commercially available or approved
investigational products have failed, or are determined to be
inappropriate for the condition(s) to be treated, and when no other
life-saving device is available to save the life of the patient.''
   Richard Alder, president and chief executive officer of Symbion,
confirmed Monday night that the FDA would permit last-resort,
live-saving uses ``under certain, very prescribed conditions.''
   The change was outlined in a letter the agency sent ``fairly
recently'' to organizations that had been using the devices on an
investigatory basis, he said.
   Alder said Symbion and FDA officials were setting up meetings to
try to resolve remaining issues involved in last month's action.
   In response to the FDA's announcement last month, Copeland said
that if the need arose he might defy the ban.
   Copeland said then the effect of withdrawing the Symbion devices
would be ``to deprive potentially hundreds of critically ill
patients of a chance for life.''
   On Monday, Copeland said, ``We're pleased that the FDA and
Symbion have opened a dialogue and we hope that there is a mutually
agreeable solution soon.''
   Copeland said he had called FDA officials ``as an individual
physician'' after its initial letter and told them, ```Now we're in
limbo again. Every time we put this device in somebody's gonna say
that we're defying the FDA, and we know scientifically that they're
good devices.
   ``I felt that it was an untenable position they were putting us
into.'' Copeland said FDA officials told him ``they thought I had a
point.''

   Political party leaders pulled their
ministers out of the governing coalition, but said they would
continue to support a caretaker administration until national
elections April 8.
   Party members who hold posts in Premier Xenophon Zolotas'
Cabinet will be replaced today by other politicians who will lead
Greece to its third national election in 10 months.
   ``We decided unanimously to withdraw our ministers from the
government of Mr. Zolotas. The government will remain under his
leadership and will continue to enjoy our confidence,'' said
conservative leader Constantine Mitsotakis after a meeting with
Zolotas and the socialist and Communist Party leaders.
   Mitsotakis leads the New Democracy Party, the largest political
force in the country which narrowly missed winning a parliamentary
majority in June and November elections.
   ``Many things separated us ... there were differences of
opinion,'' he said, explaining the sudden end of the joint
administration with the other two parties.
   He did not name the differences, but since the Zolotas
government was given a mandate to tackle pressing economic and
foreign policy issues in November, Mitsotakis has demanded that the
administration be short-lived.
   He has claimed that the all-party government is hamstrung in
taking decisions on tackling a $1.9 billion budget deficit, 14
percent annual inflation and problems with neighboring NATO ally
Turkey.
   General elections are scheduled in April.

   Under pressure from the auto and petroleum
industries, the Bush administration is backing away from a proposal
that would require millions of alternative fuel cars to be sold in
cities most plagued by smog.
   The phasing in of cars powered by fuels such as methanol or
natural gas was a centerpiece of President Bush's clean air
proposal last summer. The White House envisioned use of up to 1
million such vehicles annually by 1997 in an attempt to ``reconcile
the automobile to the environment.''
   But William Reilly, head of the Environmental Protection Agency,
acknowledged Monday that the administration no longer considers
mandatory production of alternative fuel cars as an essential part
of clean air legislation.
   Instead, the administration is proposing in negotiations with
Senate leaders that ``reformulated'' gasoline, which also cuts
pollution, would be welcomed as an alternative to the alternative
fuel vehicles.
   The Atlantic Richfield Co. is already starting to put
reformulated gasoline into pumps in Southern California in an
attempt to reduce smog-causing emissions.
   Unlike alternative fuel cars, vehicles using reformulated
gasoline do not require any additional equipment or modifications
because the pollutants are removed from the fuel itself in the
refining process.
   ``There is no change in the goals or the performance objectives
that we want to achieve, but we have tried to indicate more
flexibility about methods of getting there,'' Reilly told a group
of reporters.
   For example, he said, a city that has been unable to meet air
quality requirements still would have to achieve certain annual
reductions in smog-causing pollution. But that might be achieved by
having all cars use reformulated gasoline, instead of having 30
percent of the cars powered on alternative fuels as was envisioned
under the original proposal.
   Reilly conceded the proposal requiring automakers to build a
specific number of alternative fuel cars ``has caused us
considerable opposition'' and kept some senators from supporting
the administration's clean air proposal.
   ``We have been willing for some months to redraft some language
on the alternative fuels to try to reassure people that ... we do
not prefer one fuel over another,'' said Reilly.

   But in a speech prepared for delivery to a trade conference in
Scottsdale, Ariz., an EPA supporter of alternative fuels said they
offer the only hope for severely polluted cities.
   ``If you don't have clean alternative fuels, forget about
attainment,'' said Charles L. Gray, director of the EPA's emission
control technology division in Ann Arbor, Mich.

   Neither the House nor Senate clean air bills include a
requirement for alternative fuel cars. Instead, the Senate bill
would impose a second round of automobile tailpipe emission
controls, which the auto industry and the White House have
vigorously opposed.
   In negotiations with Senate leaders, the Bush administration has
sought to substitute its proposal _ including an option for using
reformulated gasoline _ for the second round of tailpipe controls.
   Some Senate Democrats have expressed frustration in recent days
over the changes in the administration's alternative fuels
proposal, maintaining that although the White House opposes the
second round of tailpipe controls it is now offering a substitute
that is weaker than what Bush called for last summer.
   That original proposal envisioned phasing in a 30 percent use of
alternative fueled cars in heavily polluted cities, or more than 1
million cars by 1997.
   At a White House ceremony June 12, Bush called the alternative
fuels program a ``bold new initiative to reconcile the automobile
to the environment.''
   But automakers and the petroleum industry have waged strong
lobbying campaigns against the alternative fuel proposal. The oil
companies expedited introduction of the reformulated gasoline and
have argued it is a better way to reduce smog than shifting to
fuels such as methanol or natural gas.
   The car manufacturers said they were worried customers might not
buy so many alternative fuel cars and have argued against the
government mandating production and sale of such vehicles.

<HEAD>Thatcher Said Proposing Big-Power Conference on German Unity</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Germany, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is proposing a
big-power conference with the two Germanys to work out a framework
for German reunification, government sources said today.
   She wants the United States, Soviet Union, Britain and France _
the original occupiers of Germany after World War II _ to meet at
foreign-minister level with representatives of East and West
Germany, said the sources at her Downing Street headquarters. They
spoke on condition they not be identified.
   Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd drew up a detailed proposal and
discussed it with Britain's allies at this week's East-West ``Open
Skies'' conference in Canada of 23 nations, the sources said.
   The proposal is expected to be amplified when Mrs. Thatcher
meets Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany in
London on Wednesday. Genscher asked for the meeting, the sources
said.
   They said no date was being set for the conference, but it was
hoped it would take place soon after East Germany's March 18
elections.
   Any formulas agreed upon would then be presented to the
35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
   Mrs. Thatcher's proposal is seen as a response to critics who
accuse her of seeking to slow the momentum toward reunification.
The British leader has not disguised her concern that hasty moves
could undermine European security.
   On Saturday, at a meeting of her Conservative Party, Mrs.
Thatcher stressed that the 1975 Helsinki agreement stipulated that
``no boundaries would be changed except by agreement.''
   ``So if any boundaries are to be changed, this requires massive
consultation between us,'' she said.
   ``All this means the changes they are having now in Germany and
moves towards unification must be done in accord with the other
obligations to which we signed up.''
   The Daily Mail, which first carried the report today, said the
conference could produce an agreement ``tantamount to a German
peace treaty.''
   No peace treaty was signed after World War II, and although the
United States, Britain and France renounced their status as
occupiers in 1955, they retain authority in Berlin and maintain
armies in West Germany.
   The Daily Mail said Mrs. Thatcher's proposal was a way of
saying: ``Let's be practical and settle the complex problems at the
conference table rather than through demonstrations in the
streets.''

<HEAD>Military Officers Demand Resignations of Ministers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 300 military officers demanding
the resignations of the defense and interior ministers protested
silently today outside government headquarters on Victory Square.
   The uniformed officers from the army, navy and air force said
they wanted to replace the incumbents with people untainted by
December's revolution, or by long association with ousted Communist
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   Defense Minister Gen. Nicolae Militaru held a series of high
army posts before being demoted and pensioned off by Ceausescu, who
was ousted Dec. 22 and executed three days later along with his
wife, Elena.
   Militaru came out of retirement during the revolution and was
named minister of defense by interim President Ion Iliescu.
   Interior Minister Gen. Mihai Chitac is a former commander of
chemical warfare troops. The officers cited unconfirmed rumors that
Chitac shot demonstrators in the western city of Timisoara, where
the revolution began.
   Some 700 regular soldiers from Valea Jiului in southwest Romania
also demonstrated in the square, demanding that they be released
from the army.
   Another group of 100 workers, shouting ``Where are our
rights?,'' also demonstrated for changes in working conditions and
higher salaries.
   The protests took place as Romania's new coalition government
held its second meeting. The agenda included discussions on the
government's precise role and a report from Prime Minister Petre
Roman on the state of Romania's battered economy.
   In its first order of business, the national council, which
counts more than 250 members, agreed to limit speeches to three
minutes. Leaders of the major opposition parties threatened Monday
to pull out of the council if the previously dominant National
Salvation Front that took power in the December revolution does not
stop what it called manipulation of the new body.
   One major charge against the front, which has said it will
contest the free elections May 20 against the other, weaker
opposition parties, has been its control of radio and television
andits alleged refusal to allow other parties access to the media.
   An air force officer said today that as long as Iliescu
``chooses to have people next to him like ex-generals, we do not
agree with him.'' He said the air force had good, untainted
officers who could replace the old generals.
   A pilot said the officers were very angry that the pilot who
flew the helicopter in which Ceausescu fled Bucharest on Dec. 22,
identified in press reports only as Lt. Col. Malutan, was not
dismissed and instead promoted to full colonel.
   Malutan was quoted in news reports as saying he deliberately
flew low in order to be detected by radar and prevent Ceausescu
from escaping.

<TEXT>
   The people of Dresden today
recalled the devastating Allied bombing raids 45 years ago that
killed 35,000 and leveled one of Germany's most important cultural
centers.
   The ceremonies were the first not rigidly directed by Communist
leaders, who traditionally had used the observances as a forum for
bitter attacks on the West.
   Public officials and citizens, led by city Mayor Wolfgang
Berghofer, placed wreaths and flowers at a memorial cemetery where
29,000 victims of the attack _ many of them women, children and old
people _ lay buried.
   The mourners stood before a simple memorial plaque engraved with
the words of an unknown writer: ``How many died, who knows the
number? In your wounds one sees the agony of the nameless that were
burned to death here in a hellfire started by human hands.''
   Many victims, burned beyond recognition or crushed in cellars of
bombed buildings, were never identified.
   The Dresden bombings are described vividly in the popular novel
``Slaughterhouse Five,'' by Kurt Vonnegut Jr.
   While East Germany's official news agency ADN today said 35,000
had died in the bombings, other estimates put the number far
higher. The actual figure is still a point of controversy.
   The bombing raids conducted by British and American forces
remain controversial to this day. East Germans, along with others,
argue that the intensity of the attack was not necessary militarily.
   Similar observances, some including readings of eyewitness
accounts of the attack, took place at other cemeteries and sites
associated with the bombing. Several of the city's historical
buildings have been reconstructed.
   Several representatives from Dresden's partner cities throughout
the world also joined in the observances.
   Dresden authorities were determined to avoid the Communist show
and propaganda that characterized Dresden observances in the past,
according to a Feb. 10 report in the Munich-based ``Sueddeutsche
Zeitung.''
   ``Participation of the people who live here is voluntary, there
will be no ordered delegations,'' the newspaper quoted a Dresden
city press spokesman as saying.

<TEXT>
   Anti-communist insurgents in Laos have
increased their activities lately and government forces have fought
back with ground and air attacks, the State Department said today.
   In written responses to press questions, the State Department
said some reports suggest the government counter-attacks have
resulted in significant casualties among civilians of the Hmong
hill tribe.
   ``Reports indicate that the government has used troops,
artillery, armed helicopters and planes from its MiG-21 squadron
against the resistance,'' the State Department said.
   ``We would view with strong concern both attacks by government
forces which injure civilians as well as attacks by resistance
groups on forces and officials of the Lao government,'' it said.
   The U.S. government has maintained diplomatic relations with
Laos, which came under communist rule 15 years ago. It has no
relations with the communist governments in neighboring Vietnam and
Cambodia.
   The statement said the United States does not support Lao
resistance activities either directly or indirectly. The U.S.
government does not recognize a provisional government in western
Lao proclaimed by the resistance in December.

<HEAD>Shamir Moves to Unify Party</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir today moved to
reconcile hard-line and moderate opponents in his Likud bloc after
a party meeting ended in chaos and Trade Minister Ariel Sharon
threatened to leave the Cabinet.
   There was confusion inside the right-wing party, and political
observers were divided about whether Shamir or Sharon had emerged
victorious from the stormy session Monday.
   There is a lot of time for maneuvering because by Israeli law, a
resignation has to be formally announced by a minister at a Cabinet
session. Then, a resignation letter is submitted to the premier,
and it takes effect only 48 hours later.
   Party activists today tried to persuade Sharon, the former
defense minister and architect of Israel's 1982 Lebanon invasion,
to withdraw his letter of resignation.
   Sharon told Israel radio he had no plans to retract his threat,
he also left a door open to compromise. He noted that he had quit
on principle, and ``I would prefer certainly to stay in the
government.''
   The impact on Middle East peace efforts of Sharon's resignation
and of the chaotic Likud Central Committee meeting also remained
uncertain.
   Sharon's departure from the Cabinet could remove an obstacle to
U.S.-sponsored efforts to start peace talks with Palestinians,
since he is the ringleader of the hard-line camp.
   But Shamir, trying to hold the party together at the meeting,
restated his opposition to at least some U.S.-backed compromises
for starting peace talks.
   Labor Party chief Shimon Peres said of Shamir's speech, ``I
don't think that this was a great contribution to the peace
process.'' Labor is Likud's partner in the coaltion government and
advocates compromise with the Arabs.
   Sharon had protested the government's failure to end the
26-month Palestinian uprising and ensure permanent Israeli rule in
all of Jerusalem _ including the Arab eastern sector that was
annexed after the 1967 Middle East war.
   The 90-minute session in Tel Aviv broke up about an hour later
after Sharon interrupted an attempt by Shamir to win a show of
support for his peace initiative. The plan calls for elections
among Palestinians in the occupied lands.
   Hundreds of arms went up in Shamir's support, but Sharon shouted
into a microphone: ``Who is for liquidating terror?''
   His supporters responded with cries of ``Arik! Arik!'' Sharon's
nickname.
   Both leaders claimed they won, and Shamir walked out.
   After a two-hour cooling-off period, Shamir held a
reconciliation meeting with key Sharon backer and Deputy Premier
David Levy, who is a leading contender for party leader after
Shamir.
   Winning Levy's support, or neutralizing his backing for Sharon,
could significantly enhance Shamir's image.
   The Moroccan-born Levy, a former construction worker, is a
representative of the largely disadvantaged Sephardic community of
Middle Eastern and African Jews, a major power base of Likud.
   Levy planned to meet today with Sharon and his supporters to
persuade him to stay in the Cabinet, officials said.
   While the chaos seemed almost normal for Israeli politics, some
politicians and editorial writers expressed worry over the disorder
in Likud and the uncertainty over who rules the party.
   ``A body that cannot rule itself will find it hard to rule the
state,'' said Mordechai Gur, a Labor member.
   The conservative Maariv daily wrote that Israel's image was
``hurt badly by what happened yesterday ... and Israel has enough
problems already.''

<TEXT>
   A decade after embarking on a
comprehensive study of acid rain, scientists say there's no quick
fix for the pollution that can despoil mountain lakes and kill
towering trees.
   But scientists from around the word who gathered here to review
the research were told Monday their work has brought the problem
into better focus.
   About 700 scientists from 35 nations are meeting this week at a
conference sponsored by the National Acid Precipitation Assessment
Program.
   The agency was established a decade ago by Congress and has
spent $500 million investigating the problem.
   At that time, some people wanted to declare a national emergency
because of acid rain, said John Knauss, undersecretary of commerce
for oceans and atmosphere. Others wanted to do nothing.
   ``The former group _ those who feared the worst _ was convinced
that a 10-year research program was simply an excuse for postponing
immediate action,'' he said. ``The latter was convinced that
spending so much on what they saw as a non-problem was a waste of
precious research dollars.
   ``Today, there are few left who feel we need to declare a
national emergency, just as there are few who consider acid
deposition a non-problem,'' he said.
   Acid rain is a combination of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide
that mixes in the atmosphere and can fall as rain, snow, fog and
dust particles. It can make lakes and streams acidic and can kill
trees.
   The assessment program has compiled 28 reports comprising about
15,000 pages on the causes and extent of acid rain. The documents
include no recommendations and scientists were told Monday there is
no simple answer.
   ``The full story is seldom, if ever, known about the complex
issues of environmental science,'' said William Rosenberg, an
assistant administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency.
   ``Scientific investigation must continue _ including an
evaluation of the control program put in place. In the meantime, we
must take prudent actions to protect our health and our
environment.''
   Michael Deland, the chairman of the Council on Environmental
Quality, told the group, ``You have changed the way the world
thinks about acid rain.''
   But he added, ``It is highly unlikely we'll reach scientific
certainty on issues like acid rain.''
   In his clean-air legislation, President Bush proposed a 10
million-ton reduction by the turn of the century in sulfur dioxide,
one of the main ingredients in acid rain.
   Most of the reports that are the focus of the meeting have been
released during the past two months. This week's meeting gives
scientists from aboard a chance to review the material and critique
their colleagues' work.

   The protest-plagued tour of an
English cricket team was sharply curtailed today under an agreement
with anti-apartheid groups, organizers said.
   The South African Cricket Union agreed to cancel the team's
match against the South African national team and cut the English
side's remaining schedule from eight to four matches.
   The team has play four matches since arriving last month in
defiance of an international sports ban.
   The anti-apartheid National Sports Congress say it had agreed to
end protests in return. ``The National Sports Congress has agreed
to withdraw protest action,'' said NSC General Secretary Krish
Naidoo.
   Anti-apartheid activists have demonstrated at all of the team's
matches, often leading to confrontations with police.
Demonstrations have also been staged at hotels where the English
team have stayed.
   Police said the decision to curtail the tour was ``totally
unnecessary.'' A statement said authorities had been able to
control protests against the tour.
   The South African Cricket Union, which arranged the tour, said
it was cutting the schedule because of recent political
developments. ``It is our duty as responsible sports administrators
to be sensitive to wider interests,'' the union said.
   It apologized to ``cricket lovers'' and promised refunds to
people who had purchased tickets for the canceled matches.
   English team captain Mike Gatting had no immediate comment.
   The English team defied an international ban on sports contacts
with South Africa because of its apartheid policies. The English
players are receiving $160,000 for the tour, with Gatting getting
$320,000, according to local press reports.
   Naidoo said he hoped the compromise would help end apartheid in
sport and promote mixed black and white teams.
   But the anti-apartheid group ``regrets that the tour was started
in the first place and against all advice,'' Naidoo said.

<TEXT>
   Federal prosecutors have dropped the final
charge against a Panamanian industrialist whose drug arrest
reportedly halted U.S. covert financial support of Panamanian
opposition politicians.
   U.S. Attorney Edgar W. Ennis Jr. said Monday he asked U.S.
District Judge Wilbur D. Owens to dismiss money laundering charges
against Carlos Eleta Almaran because there was not enough evidence
to convict him. Two cocaine conspiracy charges were dropped in
January for the same reason, he said.
   Eleta, 71, initially was billed by drug agents as the head of a
conspiracy to smuggle 1,320 pounds of cocaine a month into Macon
and launder drug profits through dummy corporations. Eleta and two
of his countrymen were arrested April 6, 1989, after a five-month
investigation by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.
   Manuel Castillo Bourcy, 58, a former ambassador to Belize, and
Juan Karamanites, 35, pleaded guilty last fall, but signed
affidavits saying Eleta had no knowledge of the conspiracy.
   Eleta's arrest abruptly ended a U.S. covert operation to help
political opponents of then-Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio
Noriega, The New York Times has reported.
   The Times, quoting unidentified federal officials, said Eleta's
arrest surprised the CIA, which it said had been relying on him to
funnel money to Noriega's opponents.
   The charges against Eleta disturbed members of congressional
intelligence committees, and caused the CIA to halt its program,
the Times reported.
   Noriega was ousted in the U.S. invasion of Panama last month.
   Ennis issued a statement saying the charges were dropped when
``it became apparent that it would be in keeping with Castillo's
character to attempt to ride upon the prominence of Carlos Eleta to
serve his own ends, and that he could have done so without full
knowledge on Eleta's part.''
   Eleta's lawyer, Greg Craig of Washington, said his client was
gratified by the decision.
   ``Carlos Eleta trusted a friend who didn't deserve his trust and
helped a friend who didn't deserve his help,'' Craig said.
   Eleta has been free on $3 million bail and living in Miami
awaiting his Feb. 20 trial.

<TEXT>
   The Solidarity-led government will replace
19 ambassadors appointed by previous Communist governments, a
newspaper and sources said today.
   Among the ambassadors being recalled are the envoys to
Czechoslovakia and East Germany, where leadership has changed from
hard-line Communists to pro-reform democrats during the past four
months, the pro-Solidarity daily Gazeta Wyborcza said.
   A source in the Foreign Ministry, who asked not to be identified
by name, told The Associated Press that more than 19 ambassadors
would be replaced.
   Prominent among them are those who ``came to this service from
outside, from the so-called `nomenklatura' (party elite) who were
not so well prepared to be ambassadors,'' he said.
   But he said that in an ordinary year, 25 to 30 ambassadors are
replaced, so ``this is not so unusual.''
   Ambassador Jerzy Kuberski, the envoy to the Vatican appointed in
July when diplomatic relations between Poland and the Holy See were
established for the first time in 50 years, is among those being
changed, according to Gazeta Wyborcza.
   The newspaper also mentioned the ambassador to Prague, former
Politburo member Wlodzimierz Mokrzyszczak, and the ambassador to
East Berlin, former Deputy Prime Minister Janusz Obodowski, as
being called back to Warsaw.
   Other prominent appointees from the previous power structure who
are being called back include former Politburo members Tadeusz
Porebski and Gen. Jozef Baryla, from Yugoslavia and Syria
respectively, said Gazeta Wyborcza.
   In most cases, the recalled ambassadors are ordered to return to
Poland by the end of March, Gazeta Wyborcza reported.
   Under previous Communist governments, ambassadorships were often
given to senior party officials after they were retired from the
Politburo, Central Committee or as party secretaries.
   Technically, President Wojciech Jaruzelski, the longtime
Communist Party leader, is in charge of appointing and dismissing
ambassadors. But Jaruzelski has been following the recommendations
of the Solidarity-led government, which then must be approved by
the Parliament foreign affairs committees.
   Solidarity activist Tadeusz Mazowiecki became prime minister in
August and his foreign minister, Krzysztof Skubiszewski, was
confirmed in September.
   Skubiszewski told the newspaper Rzeczpospolita last month that
he wanted ``slow and gradual'' change in the diplomatic corps.
   ``I prefer to spend more time looking for candidates in order to
find really good candidates,'' he said.

<HEAD>Judge Assesses $210,000 Against Reputed Wiretappers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A judge has assessed $210,000 in punitive
damages against two men who failed to convince a jury that their
employer ordered them to perform hundreds of illegal wiretaps.
   Hamilton County Common Pleas Judge Fred J. Cartolano ordered the
assessments Monday against former Cincinnati Bell Telephone Co.
employees Leonard Gates and Robert Draise.
   ``You have to be punished,'' Cartolano said. ``I don't think you
two have that much in assets, but I think you should be made an
example for others.''
   A jury found that Gates and Draise had defamed Cincinnati Bell,
its parent company Cincinnati Bell Inc., and company supervisors
with their wiretap claims. Jurors awarded $110,000 in compensatory
damages, and said the judge should add punitive damages because
Gates and Draise recklessly disregarded the truth in their
accusations.
   After the jury announced its verdict on Jan. 23, Cartolano said
he, too, had concluded that Gates and Draise lied.
   Cartolano said the law allows him to use punitive damages as
both a punishment and as a deterrent. Although he acknowledged that
the amount might not be collectible, he added, ``It is not my job
to collect the damages.''
   Gates and Draise testified Monday that they are out of work,
deeply in debt, and have only a few hundred dollars in available
cash. During their eight-week trial they represented themselves
because they said they could not afford lawyers.
   The two men claimed they wiretapped more than 1,200 telephones
between the early 1970s and 1984 on orders from Cincinnati police
and Bell security supervisors James West and Peter Gabor.
   They claimed the taps were placed on the phones of various
community leaders, reporters, criminal suspects, a federal judge
and President Ford during a 1975 visit.
   Several past and present police officers admitted using the two
men for about a dozen illegal taps in the early 1970s.
   But the police said Bell supervisors were not involved. Bell,
West and Gabor denied any knowledge or participation in such
activities.
   Phone company lawyers contended the two men were seeking revenge
because Bell fired Draise in 1979 and Gates in 1986.
   Bell spokeswoman Cynthia Cantoni said the company was pleased
with the judge's ruling, and that the fact that damages were
assessed was more important than the dollar amounts.
   Gates and Draise stuck by their stories and said they are
raising money to pay for an appeal.
   ``We are not surprised at anything. ... The public knows the
wiretapping happened,'' Gates said.
   Several alleged victims of wiretapping are suing police and the
city of Cincinnati. The case is scheduled to go to trial Feb. 20 in
U.S. District Court.

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze
urged the United States to expand its proposal on military
surveillance flights to include sea and space, but the Bush
adminstration rejected the idea.
   Shevardnadze pushed the proposal Monday at the outset of a
meeting of the 23 members of NATO and the Warsaw Pact on allowing
the alliances to make unarmed reconnaisance flights over member
countries.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher opened
today's session by hailing the ``Open Skies'' idea, saying: ``I am
convinced that this openness and cooperation will increasingly
become the natural form of relationship in Europe and North Amera.''
   On Monday, Shevardnadze and Secretary of State James A. Baker
III broke with the recent trend of soft-spoken reconciliation,
leveling criticism at each other's stances on arms control.
   In calling for expanding ``open skies'' surveillance to the seas
and space, Shevardnadze said sea-launched nuclear missiles are the
``darkest corner'' of arms control efforts. ``There can never be
too much verification,'' he said.
   U.S. officials dismissed the idea, telling reporters in a
separate briefing that Washington was not interested in a naval
arms control agreement and that surveillance flights already are
allowed over oceans and in space.
   Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Victor Karpov later reiterated
the Soviet position and also said that the six Warsaw Pact
countries would like to share information and planes in a common
``open skies'' fleet.
   The ``open skies'' plan, part of an idea first proposed in the
1950s, was revived by President Bush in May. The plan has been
promoted as a confidence-building measure and both alliances have
agreed to it in principle.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany told
reporters Monday that he did not consider differing positions
obstacles to a pact, and that both sides hope for final agreement
by mid-year.
   The Open Skies plan is not linked to any other treaty
negotiations. But the gathering in Ottawa has provided the first
forum for face-to-face meetings since U.S. and Soviet leaders
proposed deeper troop cuts in Europe.
   Hard-line Communist leaders have been thrown out of office in
nearly every Warsaw Pact country since Bush made the Open Skies
proposal.
   ``It potentially is the most ambitious measure to build
confidence that we have ever taken,'' Baker said at Monday's
opening session.
   ``We believe it can build confidence and predictability,''
Shevardnadze said in his opening statement.
   Both sides expressed hope that countries outside NATO and the
Warsaw Pact eventually would become part of an Open Skies pact.
   NATO has said each alliance should make its surveillance flights
separately and share data only within their blocs, although
countries being surveyed would be allowed to inspect aircraft
before flights.
   Karpov said Monday that the Warsaw Pact countries were aligned
behind the Soviet position of shared data and shared flights, but
he held out the possibility of compromise. The common fleet idea
was not contained in the Warsaw Pact's working proposal for the
conference, he said.
   ``Both sides are looking for a common ground,'' Karpov said.
   Most smaller countries welcome the Open Skies plan because they
lack the satellite technology to conduct surveillance on their own
and depend on their larger U.S. or Soviet partners for intelligence.
   Shevardnadze and Baker strayed from the main topic when they
began criticizing elements of each other's positions on arms
control.
   In pushing for greater monitoring of weapons at sea and
potential weapons in space, Shevardnadze criticized the United
States for excluding naval forces from disarmament talks and for
seeking through development of ``Star Wars'' to put nuclear weapons
in space that would block a missile attack.
   ``Let us face the truth,'' Shevardnadze said. ``Today, the
easiest way to launch a surprise attack, a military invasion or an
aggression is from the seas.''
   Baker, meanwhile, said positions taken by Moscow on troops and
aircraft still stand in the way of completing a treaty this year to
limit non-nuclear forces.
   He criticized Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev for rejecting a
proposal by Bush that would permit the United States to keep a
total of 30,000 troops in Britain, Italy and Spain while both sides
maintain 195,000 troops in Central Europe.
   Gorbachev had countered with ceilings of 225,000 Soviet troops
to 195,000 U.S. soldiers on foreign soil throughout Europe. That
would, in effect, prevent a U.S. numerical edge because the Soviets
could offset in Central Europe any Americans stationed elsewhere on
the continent.
   Bush said Monday that he stood by his plan but told reporters in
Washington that he expected a ``major success'' on arms control at
June's superpower summit in the United States.
   The first two days of the three-week Open Skies conference are
dedicated to meetings of foreign ministers. Lower-level officials
then will take over the talks with the aim of having a document
ready to sign by mid-year at a second conference in Hungary.

   Sen. Strom Thurmond, who at 87 says the
secret to long life is good diet, exercise and optimism, has
announced he'll run for re-election in November. He has no formal
challengers.
   Thurmond became the oldest member of Congress when Rep. Claude
Pepper, D-Fla., died last year at age 88. If Thurmond wins, he
would be 94 when his new term _ his seventh _ ends.
   His announcement Monday came a day before planned announcements
by candidates elseswhere.
   In Indiana, Republican Sen. Dan Coats announced his candidacy
today for the Senate seat he was appointed to fill after Dan Quayle
was elected vice president. Coats faces Baron Hill, a Democratic
state representative.
   ``Our first challenge is to sustain and expand the remarkable
economic growth of the last six years,'' Coats said. ``That means
making `made in the USA' what the world wants to buy, no new taxes,
and finally mustering the will to balance the budget.''
   Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., also was expected to announce his
re-election bid today. He has no announced opposition.
   In Maine, Sen. William S. Cohen, was embarking on a bid for a
third term. He will be challenged by state Rep. Neil Rolde, a
Democrat from York.
   In Minneapolis, Democrat Ted Mondale, son of former Vice
President Walter Mondale, today planned to announce his first bid
for elected office as a state Senator a western suburban area of
Minneapolis. His opponent would be Republican Phyllis McQuaid, who
holds the seat.
   In Ohio on Monday, auto dealer Steve Tatone said he would seek
the Democratic nomination for the state's 7th Congressional
District. Tatone will face another Democratic, a retired Air Force
officer, Jack Schira, and state Sen. David Hobson, a Republican.
Michael DeWine, the GOP incumbent, is running for lieutenant
governor.
   In his western South Carolina hometown, Thurmond told a small
gathering he was proud to be a South Carolinan, working to make it
the greatest state in the Union.
   ``I wouldn't elect a man just because of his seniority, but if
he has all the other qualifications then it should be counted, and
it is very helpful,'' said Thurmond, a Republican who has served in
the Senate since 1955.
   ``In all my years of public service I have never felt a stronger
obligation to continue my work for the future of our state and our
nation,'' he told a small group of supporters.
   Thurmond has campaign funds of about $700,000 for the campaign,
according to the Federal Elections Commission, and no formal
opposition.
   Still, he did not seem overly confident he would be victorious
in November.
   ``I've had opponents every time,'' said Thurmond, who wore a
red-white-and-blue tie and an American flag pin in his lapel. ``The
office belongs to the people. I'm a temporary occupant of the
office.''
   A former governor, state senator and judge who ran
unsuccessfully for president as a Dixiecrat in 1948, Thurmond
switched from the Democratic to the GOP in 1964. He served as
president pro tempore of the Senate from 1981 through 1987.

   Three suspected members of a
Communist death squad shot and killed the mayor of a town just
outside Manila today, the military reported.
   Mayor Felino Maquinay of Carmona died on the spot with three
bullet wounds in the head, said Capt. Romeo Gullas, provincial
operations chief of the Philippine Constabulary.
   Three unidentified youths, believed to be members of the
Communist New People's Army, approached Maquinay as he was having
lunch and opened fire at close range with pistols, Gullas said.
   Maquinay's bodyguard and his driver, too surprised by the attack
to protect him, were unharmed, Gullas added. The gunmen fled in a
commandeered car.
   Carmona, largely a government resettlement area for squatters,
is in Cavite province, just south of the capital.

   George Bush is no stranger to danger in
Colombia.
   Eight years ago, as vice president, he escaped an apparent
assassination plot in which a load of dynamite was buried under the
lone runway at the Bogota international airport.
   The explosives were found hours after Bush's plane took off.
Only then did security officials discover the dynamite connected to
wires running to an electrical generator 300 yards away.
   Defense Ministry officials theorized that leftist guerrillas
rigged the dynamite in the days before Bush arrived but apparently
were unable to sneak back into the area the day of the flight
because the army had sealed off the airport.
   The 1982 incident provides a sharp reminder of the risks Bush
faces as he prepares to fly to Colombia on Thursday for a six-hour
drug summit with the presidents of Colombia, Peru and Bolivia.
   Colombian authorities say about 5,000 security agents will be
deployed when the leaders meet at a heavily guarded naval base near
the coastal resort of Cartagena.
   Aside from the ground forces, U.S. warplanes may be used to
escort Air Force One and Bush's helicopter. In addition, U.S.
warships likely will be stationed in the Caribbean.
   ``It's an unusual situation, because there are in Colombia these
guerrilla bands, terrorist bands, with access to funds to purchase
... any kinds of arms, and so naturally there are unusual
circumstances,'' Brent Scowcroft, the White House national security
adviser said today.
   However, he said, ``We're comfortable about the president's
security. All the agencies involved in presidential security are
comfortable with the arrangements.''
   ``It's a serious environment to deal with,'' said William A.
Hawthorne, who retired from the Secret Service in 1987 as executive
assistant to the director.
   ``The fact that they're going tells me the Secret Service
believes they can provide security in that environment. I'm not
particularly worried,'' Hawthorne said.
   Bush, expressing confidence about his security, says he wants to
go to Colombia as an expression of support for its president,
Virgilio Barco, who is waging war against the country's drug lords.
   Jerry Parr, head of President Reagan's protective detail, said
that on a scale of 1 to 10, the danger to Bush is ``probably a
seven or an eight.''
   ``It's risky to be president,'' said Parr, who in 1981 shoved a
wounded Reagan into a limousine and rushed him to a hospital after
an assassination attempt. ``You can't reduce all the risks.''
   Typically, he said, the Secret Service sets up three concentric
rings of security for the president: an intensely guarded inner
circle, a middle circle and an outer perimeter.
   ``The whole game will be to minimize the danger and reduce the
killers' or the assassins' options,'' Parr said.
   Decoy limousines and helicopters have become standard fare in
presidential security. Last week in San Francisco, a decoy
motorcade of a half dozen cars fooled raucous demonstrators who
were trying to haze the president.
   The Secret Service also can change travel routes and arrival
areas and stage diversions and distractions, former agents say.
   ``There's going to be some razzle dazzle so people aren't quite
clear about who to attack,'' said Chuck Vance, who helped guard
President Ford and served on two vice presidential protective
details.
   ``They'll have military personnel everywhere: frogmen, ships,
aircraft,'' Vance said. ``I called in a whole (naval) fleet one
time in a Moroccan visit for (Vice President Spiro) Agnew'' because
of political uncertainties.
   The Secret Service won't discuss its security precautions or the
threat potential to Bush.
   ``Do the Redskins send their playbook to Dallas the week
before?'' asked Robert Snow, head of public affairs for the Secret
Service.
   ``We feel we can do what we have to do,'' he said. ``We're still
assessing it every day. It's not a done deal until we go. At this
point, it's an hour by hour, day by day evaluation.''
   Vance said he considered a direct attack against Bush unlikely.
   ``They (drug lords) could make a point for a moment but the
retaliation would be so severe,'' he said. ``I think you may see
some bombings (elsewhere) to show their displeasure and show they
have the ability to do something.''
   ``You prepare for the worst and hope for the best,'' Parr quoted
Secret Service Director John Simpson as saying.

<HEAD>Court Convicts Former Officer in 1987 Coup Attempt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A military court today convicted a
former lieutenant colonel of leading a 1987 coup attempt against
President Corazon Aquino and sentenced him to 12 years at hard
labor.
   Former Philippine Constabulary Lt. Col. Reynaldo Cabauatan was
found guilty of mutiny on April 18, 1987, when rebellious troops
stormed the army headquarters in suburban Fort Bonifacio. The
mutineers seized some 50 hostages in a bid to free other rebels
jailed for a failed coup the previous January.
   Troops loyal to the late President Ferdinand Marcos seized a TV
station and raided at least two surburban military bases in the
Jan. 27, 1987, rebellion, which ended after 61 hours when holdouts
in the television station surrendered.
   The court cleared Cabauatan of involvement in the January revolt
due to conflicting testimony by prosecution witnesses. The
prosecution claimed Cabuatan led soldiers from a province north of
Manila to reinforce the rebels in the station, but his troops were
intercepted by loyal soldiers at a highway several miles away.
   Cabauatan, wearing a traditional Filipino formal shirt, appeared
unmoved as the verdict was read. His wife cried loudly and his
mother fainted as relatives and friends embraced him after the
brief proceedings.
   His 43 co-conspirators in the April 1987 revolt were acquitted
by the same court last year.
   Cabauatan's lawyers said they would appeal today's verdict.
   His conviction came two months after the Aquino government
crushed the Dec. 1-9 coup attempt, the sixth and most serious bid
by right-wing military officers to topple Mrs. Aquino.

<HEAD>Lawsuit Cites Complaints Against $20,000 Matchmaker</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KILEY ARMSTRONG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The high cost of loving is under attack by the
state attorney general, who is trying to run out of business a
matchmaker who charges up to $20,000.
   A lawsuit being filed today contends among other things that the
matchmaker has given some clients dates with ex-convicts or people
``not quite divorced,'' Attorney General Robert Abrams said Monday.
   ``Beautiful women do not go to singles bars,'' proclaim the
widely published newspaper ads of Helena Amram _ known as just
``Helena'' to those in the dating game.
   Ms. Amram, 40, of Fairlawn, N.J., who runs three dating services
in Manhattan and two in Great Neck, on Long Island, was accused in
the lawsuit of overcharging customers and committing other
fraudulent and illegal business practices.
   ``It can never be proved; I'm going to win this case,'' vowed
Ms. Amram, who used the occasion to plug her coming book, ``Have I
Got a Match for You,'' while fielding reporters' calls at her
Madison Avenue office. ``I'm going to be so famous!''
   Ms. Amram charged that Abrams is badgering her because she sued
him Nov. 28, challenging a $250 restriction on dating services. A
judge is to be appointed March 7 for that lawsuit.
   ``I never break the law,'' she said. ``If the law is no good,
then I'm not breaking the law.''
   Abrams said his office received about 50 complaints about
exorbitant fees and Ms. Amram's alleged failure to live up to the
terms of the contract _ such as adequate screening, a specified
number of referrals per month and refunds to dissatisfied customers.
   Abrams said one woman complained to the service that her date
had a criminal record. She was offered apologies and told a mistake
had been made.
   Ms. Amram said it's not true her service gets dates for
ex-offenders. ``He can never prove it,'' she said of Abrams. ``I
check every one. We have an investigation company, a psychologist,
a professional staff doing their jobs very, very carefully.''
   One woman said she was set up with a free-lance computer
programmer ``who was not quite divorced at the time we went out.''
   Another also encountered a married man ``who was 100 pounds
overweight, with dyed bright orange hair.''
   One said her date revealed on the first date that he had a
venereal disease. Another woman met a man who ``tried to physically
assault me.''
   Another woman complained: ``Of the two that called, one was
presented to me as a doctor from New Jersey. He turned out to be a
physical therapist who never called back after a brief and
disturbing telephone conversation.''
   Abrams said Ms. Amram also features image consultations _ a
service ``generally limited to advising the consumer to lose weight
and wear lipstick.''
   The lawsuit said Ms. Amram charges $1,250 to $20,000 for social
referral services. It wasn't clear how much was paid by the women
who complained.
   Ms. Amram said $20,000 gets a client ``a spouse hunter, so
you'll not be in competition. We have membership all over the
world. These people are in a separate file, handled by me. Nobody
would pay me $20,000 if I did not deserve it.''
   She claimed her 22-year career has resulted in ``one wedding a
day _ more than 8,000.''

   Police fired tear gas today to quell clashes
among some 300 Vietnamese boat people at a detention center, and
seven refugees were injured, officials reported.
   It was not immediately known what sparked the violence between
Vietnamese from different regions of the country at the Whitehead
detention center, which houses some 20,000 boat people.
   Police said an initial, erroneous figure of 3,000 Vietnamese
involved in the clashes was based on the large groups who were
milling around inside the camp.
   Some 150 policemen were rushed to the camp at the height of the
brawl, which was brought under control about three hours later
after 12 tear gas cartridges were fired, the police said.
   Seven Vietnamese injured in the fighting were taken to a
hospital. Their condition was not immediately known.
   Five people died last year in factional violence that erupts
frequently in the crowded and squalid Vietnamese camps in this
British colony.
   The Vietnamese at Whitehead are among more than 40,000 people
who have sailed into Hong Kong since mid-June 1988 and are
considered illegal immigrants unless they can prove they fled
persecution in Vietnam.
   Those who are denied refugee status and have their appeals
rejected can volunteer to go home for face forced repatriation.
last December, 51 Vietnamese were returned to Vietnam against their
will.
   Meanwhile, 76 Vietnamese flew home today on a chartered flight,
the 11th batch to be repatriated voluntarily from Hong Kong.
   The voluntary program, run by the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees, has repatriated 1,184 since early last
year.

   A diet doctor so well-known he was rated
one of the city's top 10 attractions faces federal charges of
unlawfully distributing drugs to patients and filing false tax
returns.
   Dr. George Camatsos was in federal custody today in Jackson
awaiting a hearing before a U.S. magistrate.
   He was arrested Monday by Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics agents
in Natchez following a grand jury indictment last month. If
convicted on all charges, he faces up to 97 years in prison and
$5.75 million in fines.
   Known throughout the South for his unorthodox weight loss
methods, Camatsos has patients regularly travel from as far away as
Texas to visit him. He also sells his diet drugs from a pharmacy he
owns in Natchez.
   A 1986 Natchez Democrat poll ranked him one of the city's top 10
attractions and local hotels offered discounts for his patients.
   His lawyer, Angelo Dorizas of Jackson, refused to comment today
when reached at his office.
   Camatsos, a native of Greece in his early 50s, has long been
under scrutiny by the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force,
according to court documents.
   Camatsos is charged with filing false income tax statements in
1985 and 1986 and with one count of conspiracy to unlawfully
dispense controlled substances. He also is charged with 20 counts
of unlawfully distributing controlled substances.
   Agents raided Camatsos' office and home on Aug. 14, 1986 and
seized several boxes of medical, insurance and financial records,
according to an affidavit by narcotics agent Steve Campbell.
   The raid came a year after seven state and federal undercover
agents went to Camatsos posing as patients.
   Campbell said in his affidavit that all the agents received
brief or cursory examinations, attended a lecture by Camatsos on
proper nutrition and were told to pick up their unlabeled medicine.
   State Crime Lab analysis showed the pills included three
controlled substances _ two stimulants and the tranquilizer
phenobarbital.
   ``(Agents) observed office employees automatically entering
patient symptoms and diagnoses on patient records and insurance
receipt forms without being advised of complaints by the patient or
diagnosis by Dr. Camatsos,'' the affidavit said.

   An Israeli company has hatched a plan for
getting its clients' messages directly to the breakfast table _ ads
printed on eggs.
   A company calling itself Golden Eggs introduced its first batch
of egg-borne advertisements two weeks ago.
   ``You can't ignore it when you open the refrigerator,'' Golden
Eggs President Rafi Orel said Tuesday. ``It's shouting at you,
`here I am'.''
   The American photography giant, Eastman Kodak, was the first to
try the ads, ordering nine million eggs imprinted with the
company's logo and the slogan ``Take a picture with Kodak.''
   Orel said each batch of 1 million eggs reaches about 83,000
homes.
   He said he and an Israeli ad man got the idea several years ago,
but before they shelled out money in the company they had to wait
for a ruling from Israel's Rabbinate that the dye used in the
process is kosher.

   Columns and marble blocs from imperial Rome have
been discovered by divers on the bottom of the Tiber River, Italian
media reported Tuesday.
   Erosion uncovered the pieces buried underwater since the Roman
Empire, according to the reports by state television and local
newspapers.
   Some of the columns found near the suburb of Fiumara are as high
as those at the Pantheon, a symbol of Rome's ancient glory. Several
marble blocs are marked with the imperial seal.
   Archaelogoists said they believe the columns and marbles were
being sent from a deposit in an imperial port to the capital when a
landslide along the Tiber buried them in the river bed.
   They suspect other pieces could be found near Fiumara.
   One column was raised from the river bottom and will be
displayed in Ostia Antica. It has not yet been decided whether the
other objects will be raised or left underwater.

<TEXT>
   Claude Montgomery, who painted portraits
of L.L. Bean, Edmund S. Muskie and others and who spent his last
five years living in a shelter he founded for the homeless, has
died. He was 78.
   Montgomery died Sunday in Maine Medical Center after a series of
illnesses.
   In 1937, Montgomery made a drypoint etching of an old man on a
waterfront, called ``Ol' Joe,'' that was called one of the best 100
prints of the year by the Society of American Etchers. The work was
exhibited nationally. Two years later, the piece won a silver medal
at the Paris International Exhibition.
   In addition to Secretary of State Muskie and Bean, Montgomery's
subjects included Gov. Kenneth M. Curtis, philanthropist Charles
Shipman Payson, publisher Guy Gannett and his daughter Jean Gannett
Hawley, and U.S. District Judge Edward T. Gignoux.
   Portland gallery owner Thomas Crotty, who exhibited some of
Montgomery's works, called him a fine painter of portraits and
seascapes. ``But his work with the homeless ranks with equal
importance to his career as an artist.''
   Montgomery and his wife, Louise, used their life savings to buy
a house and turn it into a private shelter for the homeless.
   They lived in the shelter, called Friendship House, and helped
more than 600 homeless people in the last five years.
   Mrs. Montgomery said her husband suffered from alcoholism until
1969, so he felt a special empathy with many of the homeless who
were recovering alcoholics.
   The shelter will ``go on the same as ever,'' Mrs. Montgomery
said. ``I have a wonderful group of people here.''
   Besides his wife, Montgomery is survived by a son, two daughters
and two granddaughters. Services were set Wednesday.

   About 20 percent of the full-time
workers at the Great America amusement park have been fired for
allegedly stealing company property and using drugs or alcohol on
company time.
   The dismissals of 28 workers, including some in management,
occurred Friday. The theme park, closed now, opens for the spring
season March 10.
   ``It is traumatic. In any business, anytime you find you're
having drugs in the workplace, it's something you need to deal
with. Can you imagine if Great America had this knowledge and
didn't act?'' Lise Hurst, a spokeswoman for the park, said Monday.
   She said the property allegedly stolen was not money, and she
described the alleged drug use as small-scale, although declining
to say what drugs were involved.
   An investigation began several months ago, she said, after an
anonymous tip. Those employees fired were not offered a chance of
undergoing treatment as an alternative.
   Hurst also said the park won't press charges against dismissed
employees.

<HEAD>U.S. Panel Reiterates Suspicion Lockerbie Bomb Originated in W.

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. presidential panel today
reiterated suspicions that the bomb that blew up Pan Am Flight 103
originated in West Germany, but said security has improved at
Frankfurt Airport since the attack.
   President Bush created the commission on Aviation, Security and
Terrorism last August as a direct result of the Dec. 21, 1988,
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.
   The seven-member panel is examining options for improving
airport security to prevent a similar attack. The bombing killed
all 259 people aboard the jumbo jet and 11 on the ground.
   Commission members spoke to reporters at Frankfurt Airport,
where they had looked into security measures.
   Rep. James Oberstar, D-Minn., said that in an official visit to
Frankfurt Airport last June, he noticed there were still security
deficiencies despite the Flight 103 bombing. The ill-fated flight
originated in Frankfurt, although it changed planes in London.
   ``My impression then was security was diffuse, too
decentralized, there were too many opportunities for intervention
(terrorism),'' he said.
   But since then, better security measures have been put into
place at Frankfurt Airport, Oberstar said.
   ``There's closer coordination among the levels of government.
There seems to be better baggage control, there seems to be better
baggage-passenger matching, and their technology has improved.''
   There have been allegations that lax security allowed the bomb
to be placed on board Flight 103 at Frankfurt Airport, but West
German investigators have insisted there is no proof the bomb
originated here.
   But the head of the presidential commission, former U.S. Labor
Secretary Ann McLaughlin, insisted that theory remains a strong
possibility.
   She said that ``as one looks at the variety of theories, that
one certainly has merit. But it would not be up to me to suggest
that's a final decision.''
   Another commission member, Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., said
one key reason the panel came to Frankfurt Airport was to ``see
where the hitch was that permitted this (bombing) to happen.''
   None of the commission members, however, said they had any final
proof the bomb originated in Frankfurt.
   Ms. McLaughlin said the panel would likely present its
recommendations to Bush in mid-May.
   She would not detail what any of these suggestions might be, but
said they would include the areas of prior notification to the
general public about terrorist threats, and improving airport and
airline security.

<HEAD>Paper Industry Sets Goals of 40 Percent Recycling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The paper industry announced Tuesday that is
setting a goal of 40 percent paper recycling by 1995.
   ``The U.S. paper industry is committed to being part of the
solid waste solution,'' said Red Cavaney, president of the American
Paper Institute.
   But, he added in a statement, ``it will require the cooperation
of the public sector and the participation of tens of millions of
citizens in order to expand collection systems.''
   With total paper use expected to be just over 100 million tons
by 1995, that would represent a recycling goal of 40 million tons,
according to figures supplied by the Institute, the trade
association for makers of pulp, paper and paperboard.
   That much recycling would represent an increase of more than 50
percent from the 26 million tons recycled in 1988, the Institute
reported.
   Cavaney said the industry will establish a computerized system
to help communities that undertake recycling programs to find
markets for the paper they collect.
   The paper industry has begun an expansion program to provide
more plants to handle the recycling, he said, and public service
campaigns will be launched to encourage conservation.
   To reach the goal of recycling 40 percent of all paper, an
industry study said that recycling would need to cover:
   _More than 50 percent of newspapers. One area where recycling is
currently common, about 35 percent of newspapers are now recycled.
   _Recycling of about 66 percent of old cardboard boxes.
   _About 50 percent of printing plant scrap and sorted white
office paper.
   _Some 20 percent of mixed papers. Mixed papers are collected
unsorted from offices and contain a wide mariety of materials.

   The United States has completed withdrawal of
its military force that invaded Panama on Dec. 20, the White House
said today.
   The U.S. troop strength in Panama is at 13,504, below the 13,597
stationed in the Central American nation before the invasion, said
presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   More than 14,000 troops had been rushed from bases in the United
States for the invasion.
   While the troop levels have fluctuated by a few thousand over
recent years, the 13,000 level is considered in the normal range,
he said. That includes, however, the 2,000 extra personnel
President Bush sent to Panama following an election last May 7 that
was invalidated by now-deposed Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   ``The efforts of all the U.S. military personnel in Panama were
key to helping put Panama on the road to democracy,'' Fitzwater
told reporters. ``The president commends the efforts of these brave
men and women. Their task is something of which all men and women
should be proud.''
   The Panama invasion resulted in the combat deaths of 23 U.S.
soldiers and the wounding of 324, with 314 Panamanian troops killed
and 124 wounded, according to Pentagon figures. In addition, 202
civilians were killed in the fighting.
   The United States has no plans to withdraw its permanent force
in Panama. However, the troops are shifting their emphasis from the
traditional one of concentrating on the Panama Canal to help train
a new national police force for Panama.
   Noriega's Panamanian Defense Force was effectively put out of
business by the invasion and his ouster, but thousands of its
members have signed up for the new police force.
   Fitzwater said the number of U.S. troops will likely continue to
fluctuate in the years to come.
   Presence of the invasion force was a thorn in the side of
Panama's Latin American neighbors who saw the invasion as an
unwarranted use of U.S. muscle.
   President Alan Garcia of Peru initially said he would not attend
this Thursday's drug summit in Colombia with President Bush as long
as the invasion troops remained.
   Last week, however, as the U.S. troop withdrawal continued, he
announced he would attend.

begin talks on a single currency but not setting any target date.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East German and West German leaders
today agreed to start talks on a common currency as early as next
week, but set no target date for monetary union because of East
Germany's resistance to capitalist reforms.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said at a joint news
conference with East German Premier Hans Modrow that the two had
agreed to form a committee to examine how the West German mark can
become the East German currency.
   But the talks will only consider economic union in principle
because pro-democracy forces and rival political parties have
effectively forbidden Modrow to commit East Germany to the currency
union plan proposed by Kohl.
   Bonn again rejected an East German appeal for immediate
financial aid of as much as $9 billion until an elected government
is in power in East Berlin.
   East Germans go to the polls for their first free elections on
March 18, and the absence of an elected leadership is stalling
recovery efforts.
   Kohl's government does not want to loan huge sums to an East
German leadership that is expected to be voted out of office in
less than five weeks. The uncertainties, meanwhile, continue to
fuel the exodus of East Germans to the West. Kohl disclosed that
85,000 East Germans have resettled in West Germany over the past
six weeks.
   Modrow said before his one-on-one talks with Kohl that he was
not authorized to approve measures toward monetary union during his
two-day visit here.
   East German political leaders have rejected Bonn's call for
making the powerful West German mark the official currency in their
troubled nation, fearing that West Germany is pushing the
reunification process too quickly.
   Monetary union would be contingent on a wholesale conversion of
the East German economy to market principles.
   West German leaders consider a common currency the only means of
giving East Germans immediate confidence in their future.
   The decision to form a joint committee will allow preliminary
work toward monetary union to begin, despite East Germany's
position on the issue. But some West Germans have predicted that
the East German economy could collapse before the elections.
   In the East German city of Leipzig on Monday night,
demonstrators demanded an immediate currency union or said they
would leave for West Germany _ joining an estimated 2,000 daily who
have left for the West.
   Modrow was accompanied by 17 Cabinet members and at least 10
other experts and advisers for the talks, aimed at determining how
the two nations should eventually be reunified, and how East
Germany can be kept financially afloat in the meantime.
   Kohl and Modrow agree that unification is the only means of
rescuing the East German economy and providing higher living
standards for those in the East.
   Washington and Moscow have given their blessing to eventual
reunification.
   Kohl returned from weekend talks with Gorbachev saying a
unification plan would likely be ready with the agreement of the
four victorious World War II allies before the year was out.
   But the East Germans could slow the pace of reunification with
their rejection of West Germany's idea of quickly setting up a
monetary union.
   Another disagreement likely to arise during Modrow's visit was
whether a united Germany should belong to any military bloc.
   Modrow says a united Germany should be neutral, but also has
signaled he would be willing to talks about some other arrangement,
which he has not disclosed.
   Kohl has said repeatedly that West Germany is firmly embedded in
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and with the United States
has rejected neutrality for a united Germany.
   His foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, says the Soviets
are studying ``several possibilities'' for the military posture of
a united Germany, without specifying them. The Soviet Union has
about 380,000 troops in East Germany.
   Kohl proposed the idea of monetary union as a means of trying to
rescue the East German economy, hemorrhaging from an exodus of
workers to West Germany.
   The exodus is also harming West Germany, seriously straining its
housing and job markets and its social services.

   President Bush is likely to propose at the
upcoming drug summit that U.S. ships be used to provide an offshore
``radar net'' to help Colombia interdict drug traffickers, a top
aide said today.
   National security adviser Brent Scowcroft said the proposal has
been ``on the shelf'' since Colombian officials balked at news
reports that the United States was considering a naval ``blockade''
of their ports.
   U.S. officials have denied they ever planned a blockade, calling
use of the term unfortunate.
   Bush, meanwhile, signed a new United Nations compact to help
curb international drug traffic and urged other nations to do the
same, ``to join us in working together to rid the world of this
menace, the menace of drugs.''
   The U.N. Convention Against Illegal Traffic in Narcotic Drugs,
adopted in Vienna in December 1988, calls upon all nations to make
illegal the production, cultivation and transportation of narcotic
and other danger drugs.
   It also calls for tighter controls of chemicals used in drug
production, and sets up guidelines for extraditing drug offenders,
seizing drug-tainted assets and curbing money-laundering.
   Bush, at a signing ceremony, said that ``on the eve of our
Andean drug summit and the United Nations General Assembly special
session on drugs, we call upon all nations to join us in ratifying
this convention.''
   The Senate ratified the agreement last November. The United
States is the fifth of 76 signatories to the convention to ratify
it.
   Meantime, Scowcroft told a White House briefing on Thursday's
four-nation drug summit in Cartagena, Colombia, that the United
States never planned a naval blockade, but wanted ``to provide a
radar net and give the Colombians a better indication'' of air
traffic that might be involved in drug trading.
   ``We would be interested in improved cooperation in that kind of
interdiction,'' Scowcroft said.
   ``It's an idea we think has merit. I expect it might be
discussed'' at the Cartagena meeting among Bush and the presidents
of Colombia, Peru and Bolivia.
   ``We're not trying to push the use of U.S. military forces where
they're not needed or wanted,'' Scowcroft said.
   He said the radar screen would be confined to equipment on U.S.
naval ships cruising off the coasts of Colombia, and would not
entail any land-based U.S.-manned radar installations.
   However, Scowcroft said the United States has provided Colombia
and other Andean nations with radar equipment.
   Scowcroft said the communique that will be signed by the four
presidents on Thursday will address the broad issues of U.S.
economic assistance to the Andean nations and will also cover
military interdiction assistance.
   It will call for reducing the demand for drugs in the United
States, curbing U.S. export of chemicals such as ether used to
manufacture cocaine from coa leaves, and will deal with the export
of U.S. weapons to the region and with money laundering, he said.
   In additon, the United States will promise ``to broaden our
reach into international financial institutions'' to gain
additional economic aid for the Latin nations, Scowcroft said.
   U.S. allies ``have an enormous interest in the success of this
operation,'' Scowcroft said, noting that the drug problem is an
international one.
   Commenting on a dispute with Colombia over coffee and cut-flower
trade, Scowcroft offered little hope that progress would be made on
resolving the disagreements at the drug summit.
   Colombian President Virgilio Barco has complained to Bush that
the U.S. Commerce Department is engaged in a trade procedure
against Colombian flower growers that could result in big tariffs
on Colombian-grown cut flowers.
   Scowcroft said there is nothing the administration can do about
the matter, that the Commerce Department action was initiated after
U.S. flower growers protested that Colombia was ``dumping'' flowers
in this country at below-fair-market prices.
   Even though the United States would like to encourage Colombian
farmers to grow crops other than coca leaves, ``we don't know
exactly how this will work out,'' Scowcroft said.
   Colombia is also unhappy that U.S. withdrawal from an
international coffee-pricing agreement last year sent Colombian
coffee prices tumbling. The pricing agreement ``collapsed. Putting
it back together again is not easy,'' Scowcroft said.
   He expressed some skepticism over plans to try to encourage crop
substitutions for cocaine production, saying each of the Andean
nations would have to work out such specific plans itself.

   A Marine jet pilot died and a
reconnaissance observer was hurt when they ejected almost
simultaneously from separate aircraft during training missions, a
Marine Corps spokesman said.
   Marine officials at the Air-Ground Combat Center said they were
investigating whether the ejections were linked during the incident
Monday.
   Capt. Thomas Kolb, 28, of San Diego, was the pilot killed, said
1st Lt. T.J. Skipton, a spokeswoman at Cherry Point, N.C., where
Kolb was based. The single-seat AV-8B Harrier attack jet, valued at
more than $20 million, crashed in a remote area.
   The aerial observer, Capt. Jeffrey P. Schade of Southhold, N.Y.,
ejected from a two-seat OV-10 Bronco observation and reconnaissance
plane that landed safely, said Master Sgt. Sandra Riley at Cherry
Point. Schade's age was not immediately available. He suffered
minor injuries.
   The planes, both assigned to the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing in
Cherry Point, were training at the sprawling desert base 125 miles
east of Los Angeles.
   The Harrier pilot ejected at about 10:15 a.m. Monday and was
taken by helicopter to the Naval Hospital, where died nearly two
hours later, said Capt. Kevin Murphy.
   An AV-8B Harrier attack jet based at Cherry Point crashed Jan.
25 in Okinawa, killing 1st Lt. Earl Anderson, 24, of Clemson, S.C.
Neither his body nor the wreckage was found. Another crashed in
South Carolina in May.

   Beer lovers in the famed brewery
town of Pilsen have decided to mix party politics with the politics
of partying.
   In one of the odder side effects of this country's move to
democracy, a group of dedicated beer drinkers have formed their own
party to run in Czechoslovakia's first free elections in more than
40 years.
   ``The main objective of the party is to decrease the price of
beer while increasing its quality and consumption,'' the newspaper
Mlada Fronta reported on Tuesday. The party also wants 1991
proclaimed the ``Year of Czechoslovak Beer.''
   Czechoslovakia ranks second in Europe in per capita beer
consumption, and the price of a pint of high-quality Pilsner
Urquell is the equivalent of 18 cents. Mlada Fronta did not say how
much the Pilsen party wants the price lowered.
   The party, known as the ``Friends of Beer,'' wants to run in the
June 8 elections and hopes to win parliamentary seats, Mlada Fronta
said.
   According to a ``draft'' of new election laws, a party has to
have at least 10,000 supporters _ a condition the ``Friends of
Beer'' may not find impossible to meet in a country of 15 million
where beer is the national drink.
   ``We don't have to remind you that quite a few people are
interested in membership in our party,'' Pavel Mader and Karel
Sury, members of the party's preparatory committee, were quoted as
saying by state news agency CTK.
   ``We ask all people who like Czech beer to support our demands
by a manifestative gluttony on any day in any pub,'' Mlada Fronta
quoted from the party's official declaration.

<TEXT>
   Military officials said Korean
soldiers fired on a South Korean guardpost in the demilitarized
zone Tuesday, the eve of U.S. Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney's
arrival.
   The U.N. Command, which is led by the United States, said the
North Koreans fired 20 bullets at the guardpost near a border area
Cheney plans to visit.
   U.S. officials said the shooting occurred at 6:11 a.m. about two
miles southwest of the joint security area at Panmunjom, the truce
village in the demilitarized zone between the Koreas. They said the
South Koreans did not return fire and no injuries were reported.
   Cheney is to visit Panmunjom and nearby U.S. camps Friday, the
third day of his visit to South Korea for security talks.
   Firing covered several seconds, but the type of weapons used was
not clear, U.S. officials reported.
   ``Any shooting in the DMZ is a serious violation,'' one U.S.
official said, on condition of anonymity. ``That it occurs on the
eve of the visit of a U.S. Cabinet officer has to be considered in
the investigation.''
   U.S. Adm. Larry G. Vogt, senior U.N. Command delegate to the
joint Military Armistice Commission, demanded an investigation by
North Korea, but got no immediate response.
   The commission oversees the truce that ended the 1950-53 Korean
war. The communist North and capitalist South remain technically at
war because no peace treaty has been signed, and the DMZ is one of
the world's most heavily guarded borders.
   Shooting incidents in the zone have been frequent, but military
observers say the number has decreased in recent years, especially
near the truce village where periodic talks are held.
   In 1988, a South Korean soldier was wounded in the last major
incident. North Korean soldiers also opened fire in November, when
a colleague defected to the South through the demilitarized zone.
   Cheney's arrival Wednesday will begin a two-week trip that also
includes visits to Japan, Hong Kong and the Philippines.
   An official of South Korea's Defense Ministry said the agenda
for his meetings with President Roh Tae-woo and other officials
includes cutbacks of U.S. forces and an increase in South Korea's
financial contribution.
   About 43,000 American soldiers are stationed in South Korea
under a mutual defense agreement.
   On Jan. 30, Cheney announced the closure of three U.S. air bases
in South Korea and withdrawal of 2,000 support personnel as
cost-saving measures.
   The Defense Ministry official said topics to be raised in talks
with Cheney include plans for the relocation of U.S. military
headquarters from central Seoul to southern areas.
   Roh and other South Korean officials have expressed readiness to
accept more U.S. cutbacks of support personnel, based on mutual
agreement.
   U.S. troop reductions are a sensitive issue in South Korea.
North Korea and some dissidents in the South demand the immediate
withdrawal of U.S. forces, but polls indicate most South Koreans
support the American presence.

   Looking to flush long lines at women's

that would require more bathrooms in new public buildings.
   The House voted unanimously for the bill, dubbed potty parity or
restroom equity. It now goes to the Senate.

more restrooms would have to be built in new buildings or in those
that undergo 50 percent construction or renovation.
   Covered in the bill are stadiums, community and convention
halls, public schools, sports and entertainment arenas and state
buildings. Hotels and restaurants are exempt.
   Rep. Ruth Rudy, who sponsored the measure, said the bill would
help older women and women with young children especially.
   Rep. Bruce Smith, a co-sponsor, said Pennsylvania would become
the fourth state to have a restroom equity policy. ``I think that
it's a women's issue, a fairness issue, a common-sense issue,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Survey Finds Drug Use Down Among Young Adults</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Use of illegal drugs by high school seniors,
college students and other young adults declined further in 1989 as
anti-drug attitudes increasingly took hold, an annual survey found
today.
   Frequent drug use has been sliding even faster, and today the
likelihood that a high school senior or college student will use
drugs routinely is about half what it was a decade ago, according
to the study.
   ``This reduced demand is attributable largely to the important
changes occurring in the attitudes, beliefs and social norms among
our young people,'' said Lloyd Johnston, a University of Michigan
social scientist who helped conduct the survey.
   Johnston said the decline has come about because anti-drug
education has made illegal drug use unfashionable, and he noted the
dropoff has been occurring despite students' belief that marijuana
and cocaine are easy to get.
   Drug use among high school seniors peaked in 1981, when 65.6
percent of those surveyed said they had used marijuana, cocaine or
some other illicit drug at least once during their lives. That
figure dropped during the decade to 50.9 percent last year.
   The 1989 survey of college students found that 36.7 percent used
an illicit drug at least once during the previous year, compared
with 56.2 percent in 1980, when this survey began.
   Among young adults aged 19-28, use of an illegal drug within the
previous year dropped to 32.8 percent in 1988 from 41.9 percent in
1986.
   In 1979, nearly 39 percent of high school seniors said they had
used an illegal drug during the previous 30 days, and by 1989 that
figure had dropped by nearly half to 19.7 percent, according to the
survey. College students saw a similar decline _ from 38.4 percent
in 1979 to 18.2 percent last year.
   Johnston said that although the survey missed high school
dropouts, the data suggest the decline in drug use may also extend
to this group as well. The survey found the dropoff in use was at
least as great among high school seniors who were frequently truant
and had poor grades as among those who were seldom truant and had
good grades, he said.
   Use of crack, a highly addictive and smokable form of cocaine,
also appears to be dropping, Johnston said, although not as much as
use of powdered cocaine.
   The survey of high school seniors, which began in 1975, polled
about 17,000 students in 135 public and private high schools
nationwide. The other survey is a follow-up study of previously
participating graduating classes. In this survey, about 1,200
college students and about 6,600 high school graduates who are one
to 10 years past high school were questioned by mail.

<TEXT>
   A bipartisan group announced today it will
seek passage by state legislatures of resolutions calling for
12-year limits on service in each chamber of Congress.
   ``We propose to move towards a re-invigoration of our Congress
by restoring the citizen legislature envisioned by our founders,''
said former one-term Republican Rep. James K. Coyne of
Pennsylvania, co-chairman of Americans to Limit Congressional Terms.
   Members of the House serve two-year terms and senators serve
six-year terms. Under provisions of the Constitution in effect
since it was adopted 200 years ago, they may serve any number of
terms.
   The group's proposal would limit a person to serving 12 years in
the House and 12 years in the Senate in his or her lifetime. That
would mean a limit of 24 years overall in Congress.
   The group is acting under a provision of the Constitution
allowing the legislatures of two-thirds of the states to propose a
constitutional amendment. Congress, on receiving such a proposal,
would call a constitutional convention. Alternatively, Congress
itself could propose an amendment. In either event, it must be
ratified by three-fourths of the states.
   Coyne said South Dakota already has passed such a resolution and
action is pending in Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Idaho,
Kansas, Missouri, New Hampshire, Utah, Vermont, Wyoming, Florida,
Louisiana and Hawaii.
   ``We have a very, very real chance of doing it quickly,'' Coyne
said.
   He said his organization is bipartisan and has 118 state
legislators, 34 former members of Congress and two current members
of Congress on its national advisory board. He said he did not know
the party breakdown.
   Cleta Mitchell, a former Democratic state legislator from
Oklahoma, joined Coyne in announcing the effort.

   Public schools reopened today amid heavy
security after a week-long shutdown in a racial protest, but about
150 black students marched outside the high school and chanted
``Shut 'em down! No school!''
   Hundreds of other black students filed inside Selma High School,
although they waited about 10 minutes after the bell rang. White
students walked inside well before the bell, with security provided
by state troopers, National Guardsmen and military police as well
as Selma police.
   School officials reported that 1,368 students, or 23 percent of
the school system's 5,971 students, were absent this morning,
compared with normal absenteeism of about 5 percent. Enrollment
dropped from 6,049 last week.
   Selma High closed Feb. 6 and all 11 public schools in the city
have been closed since Wednesday as tensions rose in a racial
protest over the white school board members' vote to dismiss
Norward Roussell, the first black school superintendent in this
landmark city of the civil rights era.
   Student protesters voiced support of Roussell and of his efforts
to limit a program known as leveling or tracking, which blacks say
unfairly puts black students in slower-learning groups while whites
mostly are in faster-paced classes.
   ``Down with tracking! Equal education!'' the protesting students
shouted today as they marched around the high school's flagpole.
   The protesters earlier marched to the school while law officers
stood guard, and at one point the marchers had a brief
confrontation with state troopers.
   When several troopers told the marchers they needed to stay away
from the school, the marchers stopped to pray, and the troopers
took off their hats during the prayer. The students then moved
through the troopers, who did not try to physically restrain them
as they went to the flagpole.
   ``There is no reason for all this security, because they didn't
come here to be violent,'' said Dallas County Commissioner Perry
Varner, a black protest leader who was arrested in a melee in the
mayor's office last week.
   ``This is the first time troops have been used to ensure that
whites could go to school,'' said Jamie Wallace, executive vice
president of the local chamber of commerce.
   More than 100 black students who staged a sit-in at the city's
only public high school voted Monday night to continue their
protest at the school today.
   ``The battle is on with the school until we get what we
deserve,'' said state Sen. Hank Sanders, whose daughter Malika, an
11th-grader, is one of the protest leaders.
   Roussell, whose dismissal at the end of the school year sparked
the protests, said his wife, a teacher, and daughter, a
fifth-grader, would be back in school today despite anonymous
threats he had received.
   ``I have some concerns about personal safety and their safety.
This is an emotional issue tied to political and racial
attitudes,'' he said.
   At the meeting Monday at First Baptist Church where black
students voted to continue the protests, Roussell praised the
students for their conduct during the sit-in, but told them and
about 300 adults that he did not ``come here to be superintendent
over empty classrooms and closed schools.''
   Roussell took over the $80,000-a-year job 2{ years ago after
serving as an associate superintendent in New Orleans. The racial
turmoil began Feb. 2 when six white members of the city school
board voted to dismiss Russell.
   Protests closed two schools Feb. 6 and all 11 of Selma's public
schools Wednesday. Roussell was reinstated, but the board declined
to extend his contract beyond its June expiration.
   Roussell and his supporters say the board opposes him because of
his race, not his alleged lack of managerial skills cited in an
evaluation.
   He said his white support started eroding when he proposed
changing the system's tracking program to enable more blacks to get
into predominantly white, higher-level classes. The enrollment is
about 70 percent black.
   On Monday, about 150 black students sitting in at Selma High met
with Roussell, then rolled up their sleeping bags and marched a
mile to City Hall, where a sit-in of about 25 students and adults
has continued non-stop since Thursday.
   ``He's our leader. He felt it was in our best interest to leave.
Plus, the school board would fire him if we didn't leave,'' student
protester Latima Salaam said.
   After the protesters left the school, some white parents stopped
by to pick up their children's belongings so they could transfer to
other schools. Sandra Knapp Sewell said she and her daughter,
Melissa, were moving 35 miles east to Prattville.
   Those transfers, estimated by Selma's two all-white private
schools to be as many as 35 in one day, included the sixth-grade
son of white school board member Edie Jones, who enrolled Monday at
all-white Morgan Academy in Selma.
   ``I'm leaving a place I've lived in 45 years to make sure she
has a safe place to go to school,'' Mrs. Sewell said.
   Also Monday, U.S. District Judge Charles Butler of Mobile
refused to a request by the city to grant a temporary restraining
order against the sit-ins after getting assurances from the
protesters' attorneys that they would not disrupt classes and would
soon leave City Hall.
   City attorney Henry Pitts urged the judge to prohibit the
protesters from ``totally paralyzing city government.'' He said the
dispute now does not involve the human rights that were at stake in
1965 when the Selma-to-Montgomery voting rights march helped blacks
gain access to ballot boxes across the South.

   British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd
announced today that the Western allies and the Soviet Union ``are
quite close'' on a procedure for the unification of West and East
Germany.
   ``This strikes me as an admirable and common-sense procedure,''
Hurd said. ``We are waiting for final approval from Moscow.''
   The announcement referred to a U.S. plan to have East and West
Germany work out legal, political and economic procedures for a
merger immediately after East Germany holds national elections in
mid-March.
   The ``Big Four'' allies of World War II _ the United States,
Britain, France and the Soviet Union _ then will discuss security
questions, including whether a reunified Germany would be a member
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   The plan, known as ``2-plus-4,'' as the subject of a feverish an
off-the-floor discussion today while NATO and Warsaw Pact foreign
ministers held a closed session on a U.S. proposal for unarmed
aerial surveillance to ally suspicions of surprise attacks.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III met with Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze. Shevardnadze then met with West
German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher.
   Hurd said, meanwhile, he had been holding continuous discussion
with Baker, Genscher and French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas.
   ``We are quite close to an agreement on a proposal for a meeting
for the four powers,'' Hurd said.
   By the time the plan surfaced here Monday, State Department
officials were privately describing Moscow as ``quite interested''
in the scheme.
   Baker held an unannounced meeting with Shevardnadze on Monday,
their second of the day, and the two spoke for about 10 minutes
today. Baker was returning to Washington later from a nine-day trip
that also took him to the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria
and Romania.
   Three forces are at work in the no-longer-secret operation:
   _A conviction Moscow is beginning to share with Washington that
unification is inevitable.
   _A Western desire to keep Germany in NATO.
   _Anxiety within the countries among people who suffered at
Germany's hands in World War II.
   Bush administration policymakers are operating on an assumption
those concerns can be allayed _ and any aggressive German
tendencies diverted _ by keeping Germany within the 16-member NATO.
   The plan is called ``2-plus-4'' because East Germany and West
Germany, joined by the Big Four allied powers, would work out the
formula for the new and stronger state.
   As State Department officials outlined the strategy to reporters
here, East Germany would become a sovereign power after national
elections are held in mid-March.
   Almost immediately, the Warsaw Pact ally of the Soviet Union
would begin working with West Germany to plan the legal, economic
and political foundation of a merged country.
   Among the decisions that would be theirs to make would be the
size of the Germany army.
   In a second stage, the Big Four would delve into security issues.
   The most important among them: a German role in NATO.
   But the State Department officials, speaking on condition their
names not be used, stressed that no outside power would have the
right to interfere in the Germans' sovereign decisions.
   Preparations for the evolving German reunification scenario have
been under way quietly for several weeks even though the subject
was not the stated reason for a number of meetings Baker has had
with world leaders in and out of Washington.
   Baker talked about the matter separately with Hurd and Genscher
separately in Washington; with Dumas during a refueling stop en
route to Czechoslovakia, and finally, with Soviet leaders when he
reached Moscow.
   Genscher outlined his vision for a new Germany in a speech to
the ``Open Skies'' conference here today. There was no reference to
NATO or Germany's association with the alliance in the future.
   ``We tell all our neighbors what we want to unite: the Federal
Republic of Germany (West Germany), the German Democratic Republic
(East Germany) and the whole of Berlin _ no less, and no more. We
do not have territorial claims against any of our neighbors,''
Genscher said.
   He said the Germans seek unification ``out of responsibility for
European peace, and we seek it as a contribution to stability in
Europe.''
   Referring obliquely to World War II, the foreign minister said,
``We Germans now follow the path of unity for which we waited for
decades; we are aware of the historical dimension of this process.''
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Genscher flew to Moscow
last Saturday to lobby for unification with East Germany.
   ``The Soviets are quite interested in this,'' said a U.S.
official who is a principal architect of the closely guarded U.S.
policy. ``They have not adopted a dogmatic position.''
   And yet, the official acknowledged, the Soviets also have not
approved ``any mechanism'' for unification, including the U.S.
formula.
   Britain and France have signed on, however, and the campaign is
picking up steam.
   Gorbachev was quoted Monday by ADN, the East German news agency,
as having told Kohl that it was unacceptable for Germany to stay in
NATO.
   But Brent Scowcroft, the national security assistant to
President Bush, said Monday in Washington that the Soviets had told
Baker ``it was not really as positive as that.''
   And Shevardnadze told a group of British reporters here that
while neutrality ``is the best way'' for a reunited Germany, ``I am
not saying neutrality is the only way.''

   Nelson Mandela returned on
Tuesday to the four-room brick house he remembered as home for 27
years, but it has become a monument, surrounded day and night by
people hoping for a glimpse of him.
   His wife, Winnie, built him a mansion on a hill three years ago,
but suffered severe criticism for it.
   Mandela spent his first two nights of freedom in large homes in
neighborhoods designated for whites. On Sunday night, the Mandelas,
their youngest daughter and grandchildren stayed with Archbishop
Desmond Tutu at the Bishopscourt mansion owned by the Anglican
Church near Cape Town.
   Tutu, the nation's first black archbishop, has ignored apartheid
laws that ban blacks from living in the area.
   On Monday evening, Mandela flew to Johannesburg and slept in a
house owned by a white businessman, set in about four acres of
garden and parkland.
   The press and some members of the public criticized Winnie
Mandela when she had the 15-room, $200,000 home built on a hillside
in 1987.
   She said Mandela deserved to live in such a house when he was
freed, but he sent word from prison he did not want to enjoy such
luxury amid the poverty of 2.5 million people in Soweto, the huge
black township outside Johannesburg.
   Vandals did extensive damage to the empty mansion, known in
Soweto as ``Winnie's Palace.'' It has been refurbished recently,
but no one has said why.
   Close associates said Tuesday the black leader had wanted to go
straight from prison Sunday to the small house on a corner built
when the Orlando section of Soweto was being established in the
early 1940s. Mandela worked for the municipal government then.
   He and his first wife, Evelyn, moved into the house when it was
new and their four children spent their childhoods in it.
   They were divorced in 1957 and Mandela later brought his new
wife, Winnie, to the house. An outbuilding in the yard contains
several bedrooms where Winnie Mandela's notorious bodyguard stayed
until it was disbanded last year.
   The house was nearly gutted in July 1988 when boys from a nearby
high school set it afire during a battle with members of the
bodyguard. The damage has been repaired and Mandela sent orders
from prison that no one was to be charged or prosecuted for the
arson.
   Anti-apartheid groups denounced Mrs. Mandela last year for
allowing what they called a ``reign of terror'' by her bodyguards.
   Nine members of the group, known as the Mandela United soccer
club, are charged in the death of a young activist who allegedly
was one of four youths kidnapped and beaten at the Mandela home in
December 1988.
   By the time of the fire, Mrs. Mandela already had bought a
larger, ranch-style house in Diepkloof, another part of the
township, where she spent at least half her time. She did not
return to the Orlando house after it was burned.
   When one of Mandela's African National Congress colleagues,
Wilton Mkwayi, was freed from life prison in October, he occupied
the old house temporarily. On Tuesday, Mkwayi asked the people
outside to disperse after Mandela arrived for a rest, but they
simply stood silently, watching.

   While blacks celebrated Nelson
Mandela's release from prison, right-wing whites berated the
government Tuesday and some predicted violence.
   The Conservative Party, which won 31 percent of the white vote
in elections last year and supports the apartheid policy of race
discrimination, expects thousands of supporters at a rally Thursday
in Pretoria.
   ``We will give President (F.W.) de Klerk a friendly but firm
message: Your days are numbered,'' party leader Andries Treurnicht
said at a rally of about 3,000 supporters Monday night near Cape
Town.
   The Conservatives filed treason charges Monday against Mandela
and his African National Congress colleague Walter Sisulu based on
support for an armed struggle against apartheid.
   Citizens can file private charges for police to investigate, but
the governing National Party is unlikely to allow any official
action.
   Mandela, the country's best-known black leader, was freed Sunday
after more than 27 years in prison. Tens of thousands of blacks
greeted him in Cape Town on Sunday and more than 100,000 welcomed
him Tuesday in Soweto, his hometown outside Johannesburg.
   ``We are a simple people, but will not be oppressed and we
refuse to accept Mandela,'' Treurnicht said. ``Who would think we
live in a Christian country when F.W. de Klerk chose a Sunday to
free Mandela?''
   Conservatives say that, under a black government, the country's
28 million blacks will dominate the 5 million whites. They say the
solution is to partition South Africa into several racially based
states.
   Eugene TerreBlanche, leader of the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance
Movement, said Mandela's support for the armed struggle means
``conflict is unavoidable.''
   TerreBlanche said his organization ``realizes the powerlessness
of the government and is preparing itself to meet the ANC
revolution.''
   He said Mandela ``is now more free than Mr. de Klerk,'' and if
the ANC ``ever get to the negotiation table, they would again
threaten murder and death if they did not get their way.''
   About 2,000 members and supporters of the Afrikaner Resistance
Movement marched through Pretoria on Saturday, carrying swastika
flags and alternately shouting, ``Hang Mandela!'' and ``Hang de
Klerk!''
   Most right-wing whites are Afrikaners, descended from Dutch
settlers of South Africa. Afrikaners account for about 3 million of
the 5 million whites and are traditionally more conservative than
the whites of British descent.

<HEAD>`Massive National Effort' Has Failed, Environmentalist Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite the expenditure of tens of billions of
dollars to clean it, the environment is about as polluted as it was
20 years ago, says pioneering environmentalist Barry Commoner.
   ``There is inescapable evidence that the massive national effort
to restore the quality of the environment has failed,'' Commoner
writes in his ``Making Peace with the Planet,'' to be published in
April.
   ``The Congress has mandated massive environmental improvement;
the EPA has devised elaborate, detailed means of achieving this
goal; most of the prescribed measures have been carried out, at
least in part; and in nearly every case, the effort has failed to
even approximate the goals.''
   Commoner, 72, a biologist and an organizer of the first Earth
Day in 1970, directs the Center for the Biology of Natural Systems
at Queens College in New York. He earlier wrote ``The Closing
Circle,'' an influential book on the environment.
   Ruth Caplan, executive director of Environmental Action, agreed
in part with Commoner's assessment but says ``the environment would
be much worse today if it weren't for the passage and
implementation of the major environmental laws of the 1970s.''
   She said in a telephone interview that the environment remains
fouled because of a vast increase in polluting sources _ in both
cars and miles driven, for example _ and because new problems such
as global warming have arisen. They have been caused in part by
sources, such as carbon dioxide, that in the 1970s weren't viewed
as troublesome.
   ``Many of the pollutants that the earlier congressional actions
were designed to control have been controlled,'' said Brooks
Yeager, vice president of the National Audubon Society.
   ``(But) we've learned how to make thousands of new ones. ... It
is not that the solutions to the old problems haven't worked, it's
that the solutions to the new problems haven't been brought on fast
enough.''
   Commoner, in his new book, espouses a view that is becoming
widespread in the environmental movement: Further progress will
result only when pollutants are not allowed to be produced.
   While most environmental laws seek to control released
pollutants, largely through devices ranging from automobile
catalytic converters to smokestack scrubbers, Commoner argues that
``the destruction of our environment begins in our farms and
factories _ and that's where we have to go to save it.''
   Commoner cited a 92 percent decline between 1975 and 1987 in
airborne concentrations of lead, which caused brain damage in
children, and a 37 percent decrease in the lead levels in
children's blood between 1976 and 1982.
   Those improvements, he says, came after leaded gasoline was
banned.
   The incidence of DDT in humans' body fat fell by 79 percent
between 1970 and 1983, Commoner says. The insecticide was banned in
1972.
   Environmental victories also have been won by banning
cancer-causing PCBs, barring atmospheric nuclear tests and removing
mercury from the chlorine-making process, he says.
   On the other hand, Commoner says, most pollutants that were to
have been controlled by devices haven't been curbed much.
   ``A control device always allows some pollution to enter the
environment, so that increased productive activity negates the
device's intended effect,'' he says. ``In contrast, when a
pollutant is simply eliminated or banned, its rate of entry into
the environment falls permanently to zero.
   ``On the average, the emission of particulates, sulfur dioxide,
carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds
decreased by only 18 percent between 1975 and 1987. Thus, since
1975 the overall improvement of most air pollutant emissions has
been at best modest. The only exception is lead.''
   The same pattern emerges with water pollution, he says. While
some rivers and lakes have been cleaned there has been scant
overall improvement.
   The incidence of toxic synthetic chemicals in water, air and
food appears to be increasing, Commoner says, adding that the
depletion of ozone, which results in global warming, ``has also
continued to worsen.''
   Commoner argues that society must shift to products that don't
pollute or pollute less, such as lighter cars powered by low
compression engines that don't throw off nitrogen oxides, an
ingredient in acid rain; organic farming; emphasis on railroads and
mass tansit; solar power and cogeneration; weatherizing homes;
recycling; and the use of plastics only when they are really
needed, such as for artificial hearts and videotape.
   ``We're not talking about putting people out of work,'' Commoner
says. ``We're talking about corporations shifting their investments
to technologies that are clean.''

   Astronomy will experience a ``true golden
age'' of large-telescope construction in this decade, astronomers
and astronomical engineers say.
   Speakers at the Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation
Engineers' international symposium heard Monday about nine major
projects in various stages of construction or planning.
   The projects, all intended to be operating before the end of the
century, range from a 3.5-meter, or 138-inch, telescope on Kitt
Peak southwest of Tucson to the European Southern Observatory's
array of four 8-meter, or 316-inch, instruments called the Very
Large Telescope. With the four telescopes working together, the VLT
could be the equivalent of a single 16-meter, or 633-inch, scope.
   Telescope designs and materials are evolving so quickly that one
of the projects is the rebuilding of the Multiple Mirror Telescope
on Mount Hopkins south of Tucson. It's only been operating about 10
years, and is presently the third largest in the world, but the new
telescopes will out-shine it if it isn't given a bigger mirror.
   ``The '90s will be the decade of a true golden age of
construction of large telescopes,'' said Patrick Osmer, project
scientist for the National Optical Astronomy Observatories' twin
8-meter telescopes project to be built in Hawaii and Chile.
   ``Basically, the need for big telescopes is to get more light,''
said retired NOAO official Larry D. Barr. ``Detectors are
approaching almost theoretically perfect efficiency. So how do you
detect more faint objects? The answer is you build bigger
telescopes.''
   Also in the works are:
   _The University of California's Keck Observatory, whose mirrow
will be made up of 36 computer-controlled segments and will be
equivalent to a 10-meter or 396-inch mirror, nearing completion on
Hawaii's Mauna Kea.
   _The United Kingdom's Large Telescope Project, also an 8-meter
telescope, to be built in partnership with Spain and Germany in the
Canary Islands or with the United States and Canada on Mauna Kea.
   _The $43 million Magellan 8-meter Telescope Project involving
the Carnegie Institute, Johns Hopkins University and the University
of Arizona, at Las Campanas, Chile.
   _The Japanese National Large Telescope, a 7.5-meter instrument
to stand next to the Keck.
   _The $60 million Columbus Telescope Project, two side-by-side
8-meter telescopes, resembling binoculars, to be built on Mount
Graham in southeastern Arizona by Italy's Arcetri Observatory, the
University of Arizona and Ohio State University.
   Peter Strittmatter, director of the University of Arizona's
Steward Observatory, said the latter project, informally called the
``twin shooter,'' will have the equivalent viewing power of a
telescope 11.3 meters, or 447 inches, in diameter and twice its
image sharpness.
   The Multiple Mirror Telescope, whose six mirrors produce one
image equivalent to that of a telescope 4.5 meters or 178 inches in
diameter, will be converted to a single 6.5-meter or 257-inch
mirror to keep it competitive with the big new telescopes, at a
cost of about $15.5 million, said director Fred Chaffee.
   ``The price is very low,'' compared to the $45 million to $50
million for building an equivalent telescope from scratch, he told
more than 200 astronomers. The MMT cost $12 million when it was
dedicated in May 1979.
   While that observatory is giving up its multiple mirrors, the
Keck, whose cost has been estimated at at least $90 million, is
scheduled to have nine of its 36 hexagonal segments installed,
computer-controlled and ready for ``first light'' or initial
observation by August, said Jerry Nelson of the University of
California-Berkeley. Additional segments will be added as their
polishing is completed at the rate of two per month, he said.
   In the meantime, the Edwin P. Hubble Space Telescope is
scheduled for placement in orbit by a space shuttle crew in April.
From above the atmosphere, it is expected to allow astronomers to
see seven times as far as the most powerful Earth-bound telescope.

   SOWETO, South Africa (AP) _ Here are excerpts from Nelson
Mandela's speech Tuesday in his hometown:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Today my return to Soweto fills my heart with joy. At the same
time I also return with a deep sadness, with a deep sense of
sadness. Sadness to learn that you are still suffering under an
inhuman system.
   The housing shortage, the schools crisis, unemployment and the
crime rate still remain.
   I am even more proud to be a member of this community because of
the pioneering role it has played in the struggle for the
democratization of local government.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   As proud as I am to be part of the Soweto community, I have been
greatly disturbed by the statistics of crime, what I have read in
the newspapers. Although I understand the deprivations our people
suffer, I must make it clear that the level of crime in our
township is unhealthy and must be eliminated as a matter of
urgency. It is through the creation of democratic and accountable
structures that we can achieve this. I salute the anti-crime
campaigns conducted by our organizations.
   The crisis in education that exists in South Africa demands
special attention. The education crisis in black schools is a
political crisis. It arises out of the fact that our people have no
vote and therefore cannot make the government of the day responsive
to their needs.
   Apartheid education is inferior and a crime against humanity.
Education is an area that needs attention, that needs the attention
of all our people _ students, parents, teachers, workers and all of
the organized sectors of our community.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   It has been the policy of the ANC that all the schools and the
entire education system is a site of struggle. The outside process
of learning must take place in the schools. I want to add my voice
therefore to the call made at the beginning of the year: That all
students must return to school and learn.
   We must continue our struggle for people's education within the
school system and utilize its resources to achieve our goals. I
call on the government to build more schools, to train and employ
more teachers, and to abandon its policies of forcing our children
out of the school system by use of various measures.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   As I said when I stood on the dock at the Rivonia trial 27 years
ago and as I said on the day of my release in Cape Town, the ANC
will pursue the armed struggle against the government as long as
the violence of apartheid continues.
   Our armed combatants act under the political leadership of the
ANC, cadres of our people's army are engaged not only in military
affairs but as the political commissars of our movement. We are
therefore disturbed that there are certain elements amongst those
who claim to support the liberation struggle who use violence
against our people. The hijacking and setting alight of vehicles
and the harassment of innocent people are criminal acts that have
no place in our struggle. We condemn that.

interests of the people. Join our march to a new South Africa where
you also have a place. We note with appreciation that there are
certain areas where policemen are acting with restraint and
fulfilling the real role of protecting all our people irrespective
of their race.
   Much debate has been spoken of the ANC policies on the economy
relating to nationalization and the redistribution of wealth. We
believe that apartheid has created a heinous system of exploitation
in which a racist minority monopolizes economic wealth while the
vast majority of the oppressed and black people are condemned to
poverty.
   South Africa is a wealthy country. It is the labor of black
workers that has built the cities, roads and factories we see. They
cannot be excluded from sharing this wealth. The ANC is just as
committed to economic growth and productivity as the present
employer came to be. Yet we are also committed to ensure that a
democratic government has the resources to address the inequalities
caused by apartheid. Our people need proper houses, not ghettos
like Soweto.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Workers need a living wage and the right to join unions of their
own choice and to participate in determining policies that affect
their lives. Our history has shown that apartheid has stifled
growth, created mass unemployment, and led to spiraling inflation
that has undermined the standard of living of the majority of our
people, both black and white. Only a participatory democracy
involving our people in the structures of decision-making at all
levels of society can ensure that this is corrected. We will
certainly introduce policies that address the economic problems
that we face.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   We call on employers to recognize the fundamental rights of
workers in our country. We are marching to a new future based on
strong foundations of respect for each other achieved through
bona-fide negotiations. In particular, we call for genuine
negotiations to achieve a Fair Labor Relations Act and mechanisms
to resolve conflict. Employers can play their role in shaping the
new South Africa by acknowledging these rights. We call on workers,
black and white, to join industrial trade unions ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   We shall play an indispensable role in our struggle against
apartheid. A number of obstacles to the creation of a non-racial
democratic South Africa remain and need to be tackled. The fears of
whites about their rights and place in a South Africa they do not
control exclusively are an obstacle we must understand and address.
I stated in 1964 that I and the ANC are as opposed to black
domination as we are to white domination. We must accept that our
statements and declarations alone will not be sufficient to allay
the fears of white South Africans. We must clearly demonstrate our
good will to our white compatriots and convince them by our conduct
... that a South Africa without apartheid will be a better home for
all.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   We call on those who out of ignorance have collaborated with
apartheid in the past to join our liberation struggle. No men or
women who have abandoned apartheid will be excluded from our
movement towards a non-racial, united and democratic South Africa
based on one-person, one-vote on a common voters roll.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Our primary task remains to unite our people across the length
and breadth of our country. Our democratic organizations must be
consolidated in all our sectors. Democratic political practice and
accountable leadership must be strengthed on all fronts. Our
struggle against apartheid, though seemingly uncertain, must be
intensified on all fronts. Let each one of you and all of our
people give the enemies of peace and liberty no space to take us
back to the dark hell of apartheid.

<HEAD>January Gain Biggest in More Than a Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retail sales rose a strong 1.6 percent in
January, their sharpest gain in more than a year, the government
reported Tuesday. Analysts said the broad advance demonstrated
enough consumer confidence to hold off any recession.
   ``Consumer spending is still alive,'' said John Silvia, an
economist with Kemper Financial Services in Chicago. Most
categories showed advances that ``suggest to me that the consumer
is coming back in the first quarter, taking up his normal pace of
spending.''
   The Commerce Department said sales totaled a seasonally adjusted
$146.4 billion and posted their steepest increase since a 2.1
percent gain in October 1988.
   ``This positive report confirms our forecast that consumer
spending will increase this year, reversing the decline of late
1989,'' commented William K. MacReynolds, forecasting director of
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
   December sales, which originally were said to be up 0.2 percent,
actually fell 0.2 percent, dragged down by a 2.6 percent decline in
automobile sales, Tuesday's report said. Auto sales represent about
20 percent of retail sales.
   But car sales, prompted by a renewed round of incentives that
continued into February, were up 5.4 percent in January. The gain
in car sales was the largest since a 6.6 percent advance in October
1988.
   Excluding the often-volatile auto category, retail sales still
rose 0.6 percent last month.
   ``The underlying strength is really quite remarkable,'' said
David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a New York
government securities dealer. ``You really had strength across the
board.''
   ``It hints that consumer confidence is not fading,'' Jones
continued. ``As long as consumers stay positive, since they count
for two-thirds of GNP, the economy is likely to stay out of a
recession.''
   Retail sales account for about one-third of consumer spending,
which itself represents about two-thirds of the GNP, the nation's
output of goods and services.
   The economy _ particularly the manufacturing and construction
sectors _ slowed in the fourth quarter of 1989, squeezed by high
interest rates as the Federal Reserve Board kept a tight rein on
credit to cap inflation.
   Durable goods _ big-ticket items like cars expected to last more
than three years _ felt the brunt of the sluggishness since many of
these products are financed through loans.
   But durable goods sales rose 3.9 percent in January after
falling 2.1 percent in December. Sales of building materials were
up 2.3 percent and purchases of furniture and other home
furnishings rose 2 percent.
   Purchases of non-durable goods, such as food and clothing,
advanced 0.3 percent on top of a 0.9 percent gain in December.
Gasoline stations led the advance with a 2.5 percent increase, but
Jones said the gain probably reflected hikes in prices, not unit
sales.
   Also posting gains were drug stores, up 2.3 percent; department
stores, up 2.2 percent, and restaurants and bars, up 1.5 percent.
   Grocery store sales declined 0.4 percent while apparel purchases
were off 0.7 percent.
   For the three months from November through January, overall
retail sales were up 3.8 percent.

<HEAD>Aspen Election Could Create Furrier-Free Zone</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 4 grafs to UPDATE with heavy turnout this morning,

<DATELINE>ASPEN, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Heavy voter turnout caused 20-minute waits
at polling places this morning in an election that could make this
Rocky Mountain ski resort the first city in the nation to ban the
sale of fur.
   ``Everyone is coming out. It's going slow,'' said deputy city
clerk Kathy Strickland. ``We had three booths at the precincts last
time, and now we have four, and they still are waiting in line....
So the turnout is going to be good.''
   The town's 3,739 registered voters also will decide whether to
stop construction of an $80 million luxury hotel, approving in its
place a smaller one favored by the City Council.
   Celebrities including developer Donald Trump have jumped into
the fray over the two issues.
   Aspen Mayor Bill Stirling, who proposed the ban on fur sales,
said he has received hundreds of letters from around the world
supporting the proposed ban. Stirling faces a recall election in
March, prompted by citizens outraged over the fur issue.
   After all, noted the Aspen Times, Aspen is ``the capital of
glitz, where furs are as common in 1990 as pickup trucks with dogs
were in 1970.''
   Stirling counted amoung his supporters cartoonist Berke Breathed
and actress Kate Jackson. Television stars Rue McClanahan and Woody
Harrelson joined a rally for the ban Sunday night.
   Arriving over the weekend to campaign for the fur sale ban was
philosophy professor Peter Singer of Australia, considered the
father of the international animal rights movement.
   ``The real issue is whether it is all right to kill animals to
make fur coats,'' said the mayor's wife, Katharine Thalberg,
co-founder of the Aspen Society for Animal Rights.
   The measure's backers claim sales taxes on furs sold in Aspen
amount to profit from cruelty to animals. Opponents argue it's a
matter of personal freedom and warn that if fur sales are
prohibited, the wearing of furs and leather and even the sale of
meat could be next.
   Aspen furrier Mark Kirkland, leading the fight against the ban,
called it ``the biggest public relations disaster in Aspen's
history. Aspen is losing tourist dollars left and right.''
   Customers are calling and saying ``if I'm not welcome in Aspen,
I won't come ... I can go anywhere in the world without getting
into that hotbed of controversy,'' Kirkland said.
   Visitor numbers are down slightly this season, said Carol
Pasternak of the Aspen Chamber Resort Association. She said
publicity over the proposed fur ban ``may be having a negative
effect,'' but late and light snowfall this year also has taken its
toll on tourism.
   The hotel issue involves developer Mohamed Hadid's plans for a
292-room Ritz-Carlton at the foot of Aspen Mountain. Hadid, who has
spent at least $13 million already, is being sued by Trump, who had
sought the same property for a smaller hotel he says he could have
completed by now.

<HEAD>Gene Identified That May Cause Death Under Anesthesia</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The disorder that killed a 23-year-old
volleyball player when she received general anesthesia last month
is apparently caused by a defective gene that normally helps
muscles work, a study says.
   If that suspicion is confirmed, further work might lead to a
blood test to detect people at risk for the condition, experts said.
   The disorder is called malignant hyperthermia. It causes
sustained muscle contraction, fever and muscle destruction in
reaction to commonly used inhaled general anesthetics.
   While there are no good statistics on how often it occurs,
estimates range from one in 10,000 administrations of anesthetics
to one in 50,000, said Henry Rosenberg, chairman of the
professional advisory council of the Malignant Hyperthermia
Association of the United States.
   Pehaps one in 10 cases leads to death, said Rosenberg, who added
that his organization learns of about eight to 10 deaths a year in
the United States.
   Malignant hyperthermia is blamed in last month's death of Judy
Bellomo, a member of the U.S. women's volleyball team. She died
during surgery for thyroid cancer.
   Rosenberg said such young people appear to be particularly
susceptible to the condition.
   If the new research leads to a reliable blood test to detect
vulnerable people, it would be an important advance, he said
Monday. The result would alert anesthesiologists not to use drugs
that cause the reaction, he said.
   The current detection test is done for relatives of people with
the condition. It involves removing a piece of muscle about the
length of a middle finger, generally from the thigh, said study
co-author David MacLennan.
   ``People are not very happy about having to do that,'' he said.
   The test, done in the operating room, is expensive and available
only in certain medical centers, Rosenberg said.
   In the new study, scientists suggest that malignant hyperthermia
comes from a defective version of a gene that normally tells muscle
cells how to make a structure called the ryanodine receptor, which
plays a key role in muscle contraction.
   Scientists at the University of Toronto and the Children's
Hospital of Eastern Ontario in Ottawa studied a series of families
in which susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia was inherited.
They found that the pattern in which the susceptibility ran in the
families matched the inheritance pattern of the ryanodine receptor
gene.
   That suggests the gene is either responsible for malignant
hyperthermia, or that it lies very close to the reponsible gene on
the threadlike structure called chromosome 19, MacLennan of the
University of Toronto said in a telephone interview.
   Given the normal function of the gene, it makes ``excellent
sense'' that a defective form could trigger malignant hyperthermia,
he said.
   Researchers still must find the defect or defects within the
gene that cause the disease, he said. Then a blood test could
detect those defects in people, he said.
   The new study appears in the current issue of the British
journal Nature.

   ``They wanted to go so bad that we got two tickets from
scalpers,'' said their mother, Dianne, a Beatles fan who last saw
McCartney in 1966 performing at Cincinnati's old Crosley Field ball

   She's been married to the mob and dabbled

back roads around Raleigh to shoot a new movie.
   The actress will begin filming ``Love Field'' in April. Her
recent screen credits include ``The Fabulous Baker Boys,''
``Dangerous Liaisons'' and ``Married to the Mob.''
   The story involves the ``strong emotional relationship'' among
Pfeiffer's character and a father and daughter she meets on a bus
trip as she is traveling to Washington, D.C., for President
Kennedy's funeral in 1963, said co-producer Midge Sanford. The
movie takes its name from the Dallas airport where the president

   Faye Dunaway's overheated portrayal of a driven,
abusive Joan Crawford in the movie ``Mommie Dearest'' was ``career
suicide'' and a film she still is recovering from, the actress says.
   Dunaway, 49, has spent the last six years in a self-imposed
exile, making only one movie, the critically acclaimed ``Barfly,''
which was not a big box-office success.
   In an interview published in the March issue of Ladies' Home
Journal, Dunaway spoke of the problems she had with ``Mommie
Dearest.''
   ``That film was career suicide,'' she said. ``It turned into an
exploitation movie that verged on camp, and I'm still recovering
from it.
   ``Going in, the role seemed tricky and interesting,'' she said.
``I said `yes' because I listened to advice from someone in my
private life _ the last time I'll ever do that.
   ``While making ``Mommie Dearest,'' I woke up with nightmares
about her, and afterward I couldn't get out of bed for a month,''
Dunaway said. ``Sure, I overdid her.''
   The Golden Raspberry Foundation on Monday nominated ``Mommie
Dearest'' along with four other films as the worst of the 1980s.
   Dunaway said she spent most of her time away from Hollywood in
England, with her now ex-husband, photographer Terry O' Neill, and
their son, Liam.
   ``All those years in England, I wasn't paying much attention to
my career,'' she said. ``I was just enjoying Liam's early years and
working on myself, seeing my therapist every day. I still do.
   ``Terry verged on being a husband-manager, and it was a mistake
we both made in our careers,'' she said.

   Henley remarked during the performance that he and Sting had
toured the coat room at the home of Ted and Susie Fields, hosts of

   He said the room was filled with ``about a quarter of a million

tempted to torch the collection of fur coats.
   Following the benefit Sting, Springsteen and Henley gathered at

   Mourners packed a high school gym for the
funeral of an Arthur City teen-ager who received the first
experimental lung-assist device.
   Melicia ``Mimi'' Harvey died Wednesday in Salt Lake City of
complications from the respiratory disease that led doctors to
insert the device. She was 16.
   Miss Harvey gave birth in January to a son. Her mother died Jan.
31 of complications from diabetes.
   ``Sometimes we ask, `Why?' but God's work must be done,'' the
Rev. Aaron Jenkins, pastor of Oakl Hill Baptist Church, told
schoolmates and friends of the family Monday.
   Miss Harvey received the IntraVascular Oxygenator at LDS
Hospital in Salt Lake City on Feb. 2, after a severe respiratory
illness worsened. The IVOX, a 20-inch bundle of hundreds of
synthetic tubes as fine as human hair, was designed to give damaged
lungs time to rest and recover.
   The hospital said the device functioned properly from the time
it was implanted until Miss Harvey's death. They attributed her
death to pulmonary failure.

<TEXT>
   U.S. District Judge William W. Schwarzer of
San Francisco was appointed Tuesday as director of the Federal
Judicial Center, the research, development and training arm of the
federal court system.
   Schwarzer, 64, will succeed Judge John C. Godbold on March 24.
Godbold is leaving the job after 2{ years upon reaching the
mandatory retirement age of 70 for the position.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, in announcing the
appointment, said Schwarzer has distinguished himself ``in the
management of complex litigation'' in the 14 years he has been a
federal judge.
   ``He has also pursued scholarly activities and published
numerous articles and books on various aspects of procedure and
judicial administration,'' Rehnquist said.
   Schwarzer's salary in the new post remains $96,600 a year and he
is not giving up his judgeship.
   Schwarzer, who lives in Mill Valley, Calif., was appointed to
the bench in 1976 by President Carter after 20 years in private law
practice.
   The judicial center was created by Congress in 1967 to improve
administration in the federal courts.

   A judge didn't issue a gag order but she ordered
a gag for a murder defendant because of two outbursts.
   As Sabastian Frederick Morris, 28, sat calmly in a chair at the
defense table, court bailiff Russell Adams and several Harris
County sheriff's deputies applied gray duct tape to his mouth and
neck. Deputies also taped Morris' hand to the armrests and shackled
his feet to the legs of the chair. The tape was padded to prevent
it from sticking to the defendant's mouth and neck.
   In his first outburst, Morris screamed that a deputy was lying
when he testified that the defendant threatened a witness to the
murder. About 15 minutes later, Morris leaned forward in his chair,
pointed his finger at another witness and accused him of lying
about the events on the night of the shooting.
   State District Judge Mary Bacon warned Morris to halt the
outbursts, but when he refused she ordered him muffled.
   Morris is charged in the Aug. 16 shooting death of Kevin Young
outside a Houston food store.
   Young, wounded in the leg, ran three blocks to his home after
the shooting and collapsed on the porch. He died later at Ben Taub
Hospital.

<HEAD>Second Poll on Social Security Brings Different Results</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A poll says most Americans would rather cut
Social Security taxes than use surplus funds to reduce the federal
deficit, although a poll last month, phrasing the issue
differently, found otherwise.
   In an ABC News-Washington Post poll released Tuesday, 60 percent
of the 1,008 adults surveyed opposed using surplus Social Security
funds to cut the deficit, and 63 percent supported lower Social
Security taxes.
   However, in an NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll of registered
voters in January, 53 percent favored increasing Social Security
taxes in order to reduce the deficit and to keep the Social
Security fund sound.
   The difference most likely was caused by the phrasing each poll
used to frame its questions. Question wording can dramatically
effect poll results, especially on sensitive or complex issues.
   One ABC-Post question noted that Social Security taxes have been
rising, and asked: ``Which do you generally prefer: higher Social
Security taxes and a bigger surplus, or lower Social Security taxes
with the taxpayers keeping some of the surplus?'' Most preferred to
pocket the surplus.
   The NBC-Journal poll, by contrast, said some people favored
canceling an increase in the Social Security tax because the
surplus made it unnecessary, while others favored the increase
because the surplus is needed to hold down the deficit and to keep
the Social Security fund ``sound for the future.''
   Just over half, given that phrasing, favored the increase.
   Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y., has proposed rolling back
increases in the Social Security tax, saying it was improper to use
the fund's surplus to reduce the federal budget deficit. The Bush
administration opposes his plan.
   The ABC-Post poll, conducted by telephone among a random sample
of adults Feb. 1-4, had a four-point margin of error. The
NBC-Journal poll, done by telephone Jan. 13-16 among 1,510
registered voters, had a three-point error margin.
   Margin of error means, in the ABC-Post poll, that the results
probably are within 4 percentage points of the results if all
adults in the nation were asked precisely the same questions. Error
margin does not take into account the possible effects of question
wording.

this morning on shipboard routine. Picks up 4th graf: `The Exxon
Valdez . . .'</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The third mate deputized by Capt.
Joseph Hazelwood to command the Exxon Valdez on its disastrous
voyage panicked and grabbed the wheel in a futile attempt to avert
a jagged reef, a seaman testified.
   ``I started making the turn and he grabbed the wheel and helped
make it,'' Robert Kagan said of third mate Gregory Cousins. ``I
think he was kind of panicking then.''
   Kagan's appearance Monday at Hazelwood's trial set the stage for
Cousins to give his version of the disaster today.
   Cousins, the third mate, explained to jurors the chores he
routinely carried out before sailing.
   He depicted the day of the accident as routine in most ways. He
said that unlike other members of the crew, he chose not to go into
Valdez on a shore excursion during the day. Instead, Cousins said
he stayed aboard, kept an eye on the loading of oil, and helped top
off the tanks.
   The Exxon Valdez struck Bligh Reef on March 24, spilling more
than 10 million gallons of oil and causing the nation's worst oil
spill. The prosecution says Hazelwood was drunk and negligent in
turning over control of the ship to Cousins, who was not certified
to navigate in treacherous Prince William Sound.
   Cousins, of Tampa, Fla., took the stand briefly before court
recessed Monday, saying he had crossed the sound between 26 and 30
times and was on the bridge for half of those trips.
   Cousins, who testified at hearings before the National
Transportation Safety Board last year, has blamed the accident on a
malfunction of the ship, which he says did not respond to his
rudder changes after he took it off automatic pilot.
   Kagan, of Harahan, La., testified after a Coast Guard monitor
conceded he didn't even look for the Exxon Valdez on a radar
monitor before the accident because he was told it had disappeared
from radar.
   ``I wasn't looking for him because he had been lost'' from
radar, said Bruce Blandford, a civilian Coast Guard employee, who
indicated he was stunned when Hazelwood called at about 12:25 a.m.
to say the 987-foot tanker ``was hard around and leaking oil.''
   ``I did a pretty hard swallow ... the adrenaline started
pumping.''
   He said he called the commanding officer of the Coast Guard
station and told him ``this was the big one _ the Exxon Valdez was
on the rocks leaking oil.''
   Hazelwood's defense has suggested that the monitor could have
averted the grounding by watching the radar more closely and
warning Hazelwood he was off course. But Blandford said he had no
authority to tell a captain to change course.
   Kagan told of making course changes repeatedly on orders from
Cousins in the final, frantic moments before the crash. First, he
said they grappled over the switch to remove the ship from
automatic pilot and go back to manual steering.
   ``We both reached for it at the same time,'' he said.
   Then, Kagan said, he heard three separate commands to go right,
left and then right again and saw Cousins get on the phone,
presumably to Hazelwood, who was in his cabin.
   In the seconds before grounding, Kagan said, there was a command
to turn hard left and Cousins grabbed the wheel with him in a panic.
   Then, he said, he heard ``a little rattle, bumping'' and the
ship was aground. He said he had no idea of the extent of damage
until daybreak when he looked in the water and saw ``there was a
lot of oil around the ship. I was very surprised.''
   Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y., is charged with one felony
count of second-degree criminal mischief and misdemeanor charges of
reckless endangerment, negligent discharge of oil and operating a
vessel while intoxicated. The maximum penalty for conviction on all
counts is 7\ years in prison and $61,000 in fines.
   Regarding Hazelwood's orders after the grounding, Kagan said he
can't be sure whether the captain was trying to move the ship off
the rocks or just stabilize it.
   ``I wasn't really sure what he was doing,'' said Kagan.
   But in the aftermath, he said Hazelwood commended him. ``He said
I did a hell of a job.''

   One of Bill Roberts' friends gave him
road flares as a Christmas gift, but the gift-giver's flair for
creativity returned to haunt Roberts this week.
   To spice up a dull gift, the giver added a round, white clock
with large numerals and wire, and packaged it with tape to look
like an elaborate bomb. Roberts got a laugh, tossed the whole thing
in his trunk and forgot about it.
   Until Monday.
   A mechanic noticed the package when Roberts left his car for an
oil change.
   ``The mechanic saw it immediately when he opened the trunk,''
police Col. Tom Rutledge said. ``I tell you, you couldn't tell the
difference from the real thing.''
   Authorities evacuated the business, blocked roads and called in
the Gwinnett County Hazardous Device Technicians. Experts disabled
the device and put it through an X-ray only to find out the red
sticks were flares.
   After a quick background check on Roberts, police decided the
Snellville business executive was no desperado.
   Roberts had wanted flares because he had mechanical problems
with the car and didn't want to get caught without them, Roberts
said.

<HEAD>Last of U.S. Invasion Troops Leave Panama</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States has withdrawn all of its
invasion troops from Panama, leaving an American force of 13,504 in
the country, the White House said Tuesday.
   In the face of resentment from many Latin nations, which
objected to the continued presence of the invasion troops Panama,
President Bush promised in his Jan. 31 State of the Union address
to bring the invasion troops home by the end of February.
   The U.S. troop strength in Panama is now just under the 13,597
stationed there before the Dec. 20 invasion, said presidential
press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   ``All the troops are gone that went in after Dec. 20,'' said
Fitzwater.
   The troops stationed in Panama are helping train a new police
force, officials said.
   The invasion and toppling of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, now
facing a drug-trafficking trial in Miami, resulted in disbandment
of his Panamanian Defense Force.
   U.S. troop levels in Panama have fluctuated by a few thousand in
recent years, depending on any exercises the military was
conducting. Fitzwater said 13,000 is an average.
   Still in Panama are 2,000 troops Bush sent to Panama in a
show-of-force to demonstrate his unhappiness over the May 7
election, which was invalidated by Noriega.
   The opposition candidate widely considered the winner of that
election by independent observer groups, Guillermo Endara, was
installed by the invasion troops as the country's president.
   Latin countries roundly denounced the invasion, which they
considered an unwarranted display of U.S. muscle. The continued
troop presence was seen as an additional affront.
   That military presence prompted Peruvian President Alan Garcia
initially to back out of Thursday's drug summit in Colombia. He
said he would meet with Bush as long as the invasion forces
remained in Panama.
   With Bush's Jan. 31 announcement and the administration's
gradual troop withdrawal, Garcia last week announced he would
attend the four-nation summit after all.

   The Soviet Union remains a formidable military
power in the Pacific despite its proposed troop cutbacks in Europe,
and the United States must keep up its guard, Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney said today.
   Cheney told the Pacific and Asian Affairs Council the Soviets
maintain more than a half-million ground troops in Asia, dozens of
air divisions and one of its largest naval fleets, numbering more
than 260 surface ships and submarines.
   Despite publicity over a Soviet drawdown in Cam Ranh Bay in
Vietnam, he said, the Soviet Union continues to update and improve
its navy in the region.
   ``What it may be losing in numbers, it is gaining back in terms
of more modern, capable ships and advanced weaponry,'' Cheney said,
referring to the Soviet military as a ``formidable'' force in the
region.
   Reminding his listeners in Hawaii of the ``profound shock'' that
overcame the United States with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor
in 1941, Cheney argued that the United States must maintain its
military strength in order to remain a global power and to protect
its interests in the Pacific.
   He noted that America's commerce in East Asia and the Pacific
amounts to 35 percent of its world trade.
   Cheney spoke before flying to Seoul, South Korea, for a two-week
Pacific tour to study U.S. troops commitments in light of
congressional pressure for budget savings and increased support for
U.S. forces from Asian nations hosting American troops.
   Some 120,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Hawaii and in South
Korea, the Philippines and Japan.
   Speaking with reporters Monday, Cheney said he had no plans ``to
dramatically alter our posture in the Pacific.''
   But, he added, ``I don't rule out prospects for adjustments in
our for deployments or in the overall size of our forces.''
   In recently announcing base closings and realignments, Cheney
ordered that U.S. military personnel be withdrawn from three
airbases in South Korea, an act that concerned nations that have
benefited by the U.S. military presence.
   Cheney said he hopes to consult with the allied nations in the
Pacific ``and find ways for them to do more.''
   Cheney was to be accompanied by a special State Department
ambassador for ``burdensharing,'' the term for requesting more
backup for the U.S. military stationed in nations whose economies
are doing well.
   His trip has already sparked one controversy. Philippine
President Corazon Aquino, angry that the Bush administration hasn't
met payments on its bases in the Philippines, said she will not
meet with Cheney.
   ``It's too bad Mrs. Aquino didn't want to host me. That's her
choice. I've got plenty to do there to keep me busy,'' Cheney said.
   Talks on renewing the leases the huge U.S. bases in the
Philippines are slated to begin next month. ``We want to be a good
friend and ally, but we won't stay anywhere we aren't wanted,''
Cheney said.
   The defense secretary strongly disagreed with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's call to have U.S. and Soviet troops in
Europe at equal levels.
   ``I don't believe there's any requirement on our part to go to
the exact same level the Soviets are at,'' Cheney said.
   President Bush has proposed that Soviet troop levels in Europe
go down to 195,000 in the central core of Europe, while U.S. levels
could be 225,000, if forces in nations such as Britain, Greece and
Turkey are included.
   ``I think it's a good position and I think we ought to stick to
it,'' Cheney said.
   ``We are there as allies. They are there as occupational forces.
... It's important for us not to assume a moral equivalence between
the Soviet occupation of Europe and our presence there as allies,''
he said.

   The Communist Party of Lenin has endorsed
elections, given up the right to control political life in the
Soviet Union and says it favors private ownership.
   What's left of the Soviet Communist Party appears to be mainly
vague concepts such as ``spirit'' and ``methodology.''
   The new party platform to be considered by the Supreme Soviet
legislature on Wednesday bears little resemblance in concept or
phraseology to the ideas that have driven the Soviet Union for 72
years.
   Pushed by Mikhail S. Gorbachev through a meeting of the
Communist Party Central Committee last week, the platform calls for
a strong European-style presidency in a country where the Communist
Party chief has been the most powerful person.
   Some other contradictions with the past:
   _In a system based on iron deductive logic claiming to predict
the course of history, the platform decries ``ideological blinkers,
dogmatism and intolerance towards different views and ideas.''
   _From the Marxist prohibition on private ownership of factories,
the party has come to the believe that ``the existence of
individual property, including ownership of the means of
production, does not contradict the modern stage in the country's
economic development.''
   _The new Soviet Communist Party now believes that instead of a
dictatorship of the proletariat leading to communism, ``there is no
room for dictatorship by any class.'' Democratic centralism, the
theory that requires strict obedience to decisions made at the top
is under review.
   _Competition from other political parties is now all right. The
party recognizes that other countries using other systems have
found a path to the general prosperity and social justice
Communists thought could only be reached through Marxism.
   The large majority of Supreme Soviet deputies who gather in the
Kremlin on Wednesday will be asked to put those new ideas into
action by calling an emergency session of the Congress of People's
Deputies to strengthen the presidency, and passing laws on
ownership of land, property, and taxation.
   The new platform has phrases such as ``immunity of ... home and
property, the secrecy of correspondence and telephone
conversations,'' and ``freedom of speech, the press, meetings and
demonstrations and the formation of public organizations.''
   It also talks about ``free self-determination in the spiritual
sphere, the freedom of conscience and religion.''
   The platform sketches a pluralistic system of political
liberties and varied forms of ownership that make the future Soviet
Union sound much like a Western democracy with a mixed economy.
   What is left of Marxist theory and Soviet Communist practice?
   The platform at the beginning of its first section affirms its
``faithfulness to the creative spirit of the materialist world
outlook and the dialectic methodology of Marx, Engels and Lenin.''
   There is little to indicate how that will be implemented and if
the Communists keep power, how it will distinguish the Soviet Union
from other countries.
   The platform proclaims with pride the Soviet Union's commitment
to pensions, free education and medical care and other social
benefits pioneered by Soviet socialism. But they no longer can make
the Soviet Union distinctive since the same benefits are offered
elsewhere.
   Despite permitting private ownership of factories, the new
Communist policy statement echoes classic Marxism by taking a stand
against the alienation of man from the product of his work, and
exploitation of one man by another.
   Both of those were thought to be the fruits of private
ownership, which the party now says is permissible.
   One area where the party's intentions are not clear is on the
question of private ownership of land.
   It cost millions of lives, but Stalin took all the land for the
state and organized peasant farmers into large collectives.
   Legislation that will be presented to the Supreme Soviet says
land belongs to the people and may not be bought or sold, holding
true to Marxist restrictions.
   But one amendment calls for giving the Soviet republics the
right to make exceptions to that rule, and the legislation also
would permit farmers to pass the publicly owned land on to their
children.

<TEXT>
   Leaders of a new organization called Tuesday
for state legislatures to back a constitutional amendment limiting
the tenure of members of Congress to 12 years in each house.
   ``America's outrage with its Congress has reached an all-time
high, and it's no wonder,'' said former Rep. James K. Coyne of
Pennsylvania, co-chairman of Americans to Limit Congressional Terms.
   ``Even as we struggle to free ourselves from budget deficits,
Congress acts to give itself a 40 percent pay raise. By 1991,
members of Congress will pay themselves nearly $121,000 a year,
placing them in the top 1 percent of American wage earners.''
   The organization wants two-thirds of the state legislatures to
pass resolutions calling upon Congress to convene a constitutional
convention to enact a constitutional amendment limiting a lawmaker
to two six-year terms in the Senate and six two-year terms in the
House.
   The proposed constitutional amendment would allow a person to
serve maximum 12-year terms in both houses, for a total of 24 years
in Congress.
   Any constitutional amendment must be ratified by three-fourths
of the states.
   However, members of the group declined to suggest that Sen.
Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., should step down. Thurmond, at 87 the
oldest member of Congress, said Monday that he would seek his
seventh term this year.
   Carter Hardwick of Charleston, S.C., a member of the steering
committee of Americans to Limit Congressional Terms, said Thurmond
had told him he favored the idea of limitations.
   ``I hope that nothing I say will be harmful to him,'' Hardwick
said. ``Until the rules are changed for all the congressmen, I
would think we would be better served for him to continue to
serve.''
   Thurmond said in a statement Tuesday that he did meet with
Hardwick and told him the idea ``should be given careful
consideration and study and, if the people deem it wise to amend
the Constitution to this effect, they have the right to do so.''
   ``However, unless this is done and everything being equal, a
member's seniority greatly influences both his effectiveness and
ability to meet the needs of the people of his state.''
   Cleta Mitchell, a former Democratic state legislator from
Oklahoma who joined Coyne in the announcement, conceded that ``you
will find a lot of Republicans, perhaps more than Democrats,''
among the 188 state legislators the group says is backing its
proposal.
   Democrats control both houses of Congress.
   Coyne said South Dakota has passed a resolution on the proposal,
and that action was pending in Alaska, Arizona, Colorado,
Connecticut, Idaho, Kansas, Missouri, New Hampshire, Utah, Vermont,
Wyoming, Florida, Louisiana and Hawaii.

<TEXT>
   A state judge ruled today that Virginia
does not owe about $400 million in refunds to federal retirees who
were taxed illegally until last year.
   Alexandria Circuit Judge Donald H. Kent's ruling makes Virginia
the first state to win a lawsuit stemming from the U.S. Supreme
Court's ruling last year that several states had taxed retirees
improperly, the attorney general's office said in a statement.
   Virginia revised its income tax laws in response to the ruling.
Before the ruling, the state had allowed state government retirees'
pensions to be tax-free, but had taxed the pensions of federal
government retirees.
   The high court said all retirees must be taxed the same. In a
special session in April, the Legislature enacted a tax break for
all pensioners. A revision of that tax break that would make it
less costly is pending in the legislature this year.
   Dennis Harrington, a spokesman for the National Association of
Retired Federal Employees in Washington, said the organization was
prepared to appeal Kent's ruling on behalf of the approximately
200,000 retired federal workers who live in Virginia.
   Michael Kator, the lawyer who represented the retirees, said he
would ask the Virginia Supreme Court to overturn Kent. Kator also
said the U.S. Supreme Court has two pending cases, from Arkansas
and Florida, that center on the question of unconstitutionally
collected taxes.
   Meanwhile, the Virginia Senate voted 31-8 today for a bill that
would reduce the pension tax break enacted last year by $111
million over the next two years.
   Legislators said the reform was needed because the bill passed
last year was going to cost about $65 million more than they
expected, and the state is facing a decline in revenue growth.

<HEAD>Four-Masted Square-Rigger, Damaged by Fire, to Leave Philadelphia</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The four-masted square-rigger Moshulu, the
last winner of the great grain race around Cape Horn and a fixture
on the waterfront for years, is expected to be returned to sailing
condition and leave the city.
   One possible new berth for the 394-foot barkentine, the largest
of its kind still afloat, is San Francisco, its home port when it
sailed under a U.S. flag, according to a spokesman for the owner.
   The 86-year-old tall ship has been a restaurant at Penn's
Landing since 1976. Last July its plush interior was heavily
damaged by a fire and the black, iron-hulled ship has been boarded
up for months.
   A spokesman for the owner, Specialty Restaurants Inc. of
Anaheim, Calif., said the plan is to refit the Moshulu in another
city, possibly Wilmington, Del., as a working ship and sail it to a
new home.
   ``At one time it was thought she'd never sail again. But that
hull, built in 1904, is as sound as the day she was built,'' said
Raymond E. Wallace, a marine architect in San Pedro, Calif., who is
working on the Moshulu for the restaurant company.
   Specialty Restaurants, which owns 68 theme restaurants around
the nation, has started soliciting sponsors among corporations and
foundations, Wallace said. It would cost $4 million to $6 million
to put it under sail again.
   Restaurant company President David Tallichet is committed to the
idea, Wallace said. ``He wants something to happen here pretty
soon. He loves the ship and so do I,'' Wallace said.
   The ship, originally named the Kurt, was built along Scotland's
Clyde River in 1904 for a German company and started out carrying
copper and nitrate from mines in Chile and Mexico.
   The United States seized the ship when it entered World War I.
It was renamed Moshulu, believed to be an Indian word for
``fearless.'' The U.S. Shipping Board operated it until 1921, when
the government sold it to a company that used it to haul lumber.
   In 1935, it was sold to a Finnish shipper and put into the grain
trade from Australia to Europe. Giant sailing ships raced around
Cape Horn in what came to be called the Great Grain Races of the
1920s and 30s.
   The Moshulu, carrying 45,000 square feet of canvas, won the last
race, sailing from Melbourne, Australia, to Cardiff, Wales, in 91
days in 1939. The record was 83 days set by the bark Parma in 1933.
   The Moshulu lost its masts during World War II and was used as a
storage barge.
   Wallace and Tallichet found the hulk in Finland and brought it
to the United States. The present set of masts and yards were put
on only for show and could not carry sails, Wallace said.
   Restaurant company executive Jeff Mills said the tall ship could
end up in a number of seaports, either as a restaurant or a museum,
but Philadelphia is not one of them. ``Our lease is up,'' he said.
   Possible new locations include Jersey City, N.J., Wilmington,
San Francisco and San Diego, he said.
   The fire that damaged the Moshulu started when a bare light bulb
ignited paper products in a storage area, city fire officials said.
It burned the ship's hold and sent smoke throughout the upper
decks. Six people were injured and 200 restaurant patrons had to
flee.

<DATELINE>CARTAGENA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas kidnapped two
Americans to protest President Bush's visit here next week and said
they would put their captives on trial, police said today.
   The Americans, snatched in the drug capital of Medellin, were
identified as David Kent and James Archer Donelly, a police
spokesman told The Associated Press.
   The Colombian radio network Caracol said its Medellin station
received a telephone call from an anonymous man claiming to be a
spokesman for leftist guerrillas who claimed responsibility for the
abductions.
   The man said the two men would be put on trial and would be
released in five days, Caracol said. The caller did not explain why
there would be a trial and why the captives would be released.
   The Colombian radio network RCN said Kent was from Indianapolis.
The police said he had lived in Medellin for several years and was
a teacher at the bilingual, private Colombo school.
   Donelly runs a company that manufactures hydraulic equipment,
the police spokesman said, speaking on condition he not be named.
The spokesman said he could not reveal any further details on the
kidnappings.
   The police spokesman said the kidnappers were from the National
Liberation Army, a leftist guerrilla group, known by its initials
in Spanish as the ELN.
   There was no way to confirm if the kidnapppers really are
leftist guerrillas. Drug traffickers have been found in the past
posing as leftist insurgents.
   The public affairs office of the U.S. Embassy in Bogota said it
was trying to confirm the information on the kidnappings.
   The ELN has become the most active of Colombia's six leftist
guerrilla groups with a total of about 10,000 armed insurgents.
Organized about 15 years ago, it has consistently patterned its
ideological dialogue on the teachings of Cuba's Fidel Castro.
   The ELN has kidnapped dozens of people in the last four years,
many of them small town mayors who were held several days while
they were warned to do more for Colombia's poor.

   Wind and the tide turned from
allies to enemies today, sending waves of gooey brown foam and
sludge ashore and spurring calls for more workers to clean up an
oil spill.
   Winds reversing toward shore combined with high tides to push
new bands of thick crude oil onto state beaches, producing the
worst shoreline contamination yet from Wednesday's tanker spill.
   An earlier offshore wind pattern and calm seas that helped keep
much of the 400,000-gallon oil slick from hitting the beach through
the weekend gave way to onshore winds reaching speeds of 30 mph and
6-foot seas, the National Weather Service said.
   ``We have a very serious situation down here,'' said Mayor Tom
Mays, who called on Gov. George Deukmejian to declare an emergency.
A spokesman said the governor would consider the move today.
   Two skimmers worked to keep a finger of the slick 200 yards from
the Newport Beach shore. About 300 people were dispatched for
overnight cleanup and British Petroleum said it would increase the
number of workers throughout the day, the Coast Guard said. By
Wednesday, police Sgt. Andy Gonis said 100 people would be
dispatched to work a vacuum truck and absorbent booms.
   ``We're very concerned about the weather,'' Gonis said.
   On Monday, waves of grimy crude oil spilled by the tanker
American Trader rolled into Bolsa Chica State Beach, leaving on the
beach bands of oil with a consistency of tar that were 2 inches
thick in some spots.
   About 15 miles of beaches were ordered closed to the public, and
ship traffic was barred at Newport Harbor, Anaheim Bay, Huntington
Harbour and the San Gabriel River.
   Meanwhile, the patched-up, 811-foot American Trader moved from a
Long Beach Harbor anchorage and tied up at an Arco dock this
morning to unload its remaining cargo of crude oil and to begin
repairs of hull punctures.
   An estimated 400,000 gallons of oil leaked from the vessel last
Wednesday afternoon after it apparently collided twice with its own
anchor while mooring in shallow water at an offshore oil pipeline.
   Divers applied temporary patches to two holes in the punctured
hull Sunday, and authorities said the vessel passed ``watertight
integrity'' tests.
   The oily onslaught spared the nearby inland Bolsa Chica
Wetlands, an ecological reserve that's home for the endangered
California brown pelican and a stop for thousands of migratory
birds and marine life.
   ``There is no oil in the estuary,'' said Patrick Moore of the
state Department of Fish and Game. ``But birds are leaving the
wetlands and going to the ocean and bringing the oil back to the
estuary.''
   In addition to the 30-foot-wide slick on Bolsa Chica State
Beach, the Coast Guard said smaller ribbons of oil 4-feet-wide were
reported near the Huntington Beach Pier.
   Seventy-one dead birds _ grebes, gulls, loons and pelicans _
have been found in the area and more than 200 oil-soaked birds were
rescued and taken to a treatment center, Moore said.
   The beach pollution was so serious that British Petroleum, which
chartered the American Trader, put out the call for more applicants
to add to the current work force of about 400 cleanup employees.
   ``We are looking for people who want to volunteer to be
employed,'' said BP spokesman Fred Garibaldi.
   The Coast Guard said one-third of the Alaskan crude still
menaced the coast, staining sand as far north as Long Beach.
Skimmers picked up 23 percent of the spill and 43 percent
evaporated or naturally dissipated.
   On the beach, meanwhile, politicians, environmentalists and
celebrities gathered on the sand to demand legislation at the
federal and state levels to prevent another spill.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., viewed the beaches from a
helicopter, then criticized President Bush for telling reporters
Monday that the spill should not sound the death knell for offshore
oil drilling.
   ``The president should read the environmental impact statements
by his own Department of the Interior, which point out that the
more drilling platforms that you have the more tankers you will
need,'' said Cranston.
   In searching for the accident's cause, the Coast Guard said drug
and alcohol tests on the ship's officers, including Capt. Robert
Laware, were negative.

<HEAD>Attorneys Say Keating Victim of Government Vendetta</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Over the objections of government attorneys, a
federal judge on Tuesday allowed lawyers for Phoenix millionaire
Charles H. Keating Jr. to portray him as a victim of a vendetta by
federal savings and loan regulators.
   U.S. District Court Judge Stanley Sporkin, a former top
regulator himself at the Securities and Exchange Commission,
repeatedly overruled objections to testimony alleging leaks of
confidential information from the Federal Home Loan Bank Board
about Keating's Lincoln and Savings and Loan Association.
   Attorneys for the Treasury Department's Office of Thrift
Supervision, which last year replaced the bank board as the thrift
industry's chief regulator, argued that the leaks were irrelevant
to Keating's suit challenging the federal takeover of the $5.5
billion thrift last April.
   Sporkin, however, said he wanted to learn the ``broad backdrop''
to a case that, because of Keating's $1.3 million in political
gifts to five U.S. senators who interceded on Lincoln's behalf, has
become the focal point of a congressional ethics probe.
   ``Lincoln has the right to tell their side of the story and
they're telling it,'' he said. ``They're saying we are not looters
as we are accused. They're just playing their cards.''
   The hearing, going into its 10th day, technically is on a
government motion to dismiss Keating's suit alleging that the
seizing of Lincoln last year by regulators was ``capricious and
arbitrary.''
   Judith Wischer, who headed the day-to-day operation of Keating's
real estate and thrift empire as president of American Continental
_ Lincoln's parent company _ testified Tuesday that confidential
information about Lincoln and its loans was repeatedly leaked by
the bank board to journalists.
   Results of a 1986 exam of the bank were published in The Wall
Street Journal and the Mesa (Arizona) Tribune four months before
Lincoln was officials notified of them, she said.
   ``You read about them in the newspaper, that's the way you were
advised of the exam?'' Sporkin asked, incredulously.
   ``That's the way we were advised of the exam,'' Mrs. Wischer
replied.
   It was only through press reports, she said, that American
Continental learned much later that the examiners in May 1987 also
had recommended to bank board officials in Washington that the
government take over Lincoln then.
   That recommendation fell on deaf ears for nearly two years.
During that time, officials now contend, the cost to taxpayers of
covering Lincoln's loss of federally insured deposits to soured
real estate loans doubled to nearly $2 billion.
   Just a month before the May 1987 recommendation, the San
Francisco regulatory officials in charge of Lincoln's audit were
summoned to Washington to meet with the five senators.
   The five _ Sens. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; Dennis DeConcini,
D-Ariz.; John McCain, R-Ariz.; John Glenn, D-Ohio, and Donald W.
Riegle Jr., D-Mich. _ have all denied trying to influence the
regulators improperly. All are now under investigation by the
Senate Ethics Committee.

   Moses LeRoy, who filed a landmark 1973 lawsuit
for minority representation on the City Council to force adoption
of single-member districts, has died of kidney failure. He was 92.
   Prior to the lawsuit against the city, only one black had been
elected to the council in Houston's history. Now there are five
black members and one Hispanic on the 14-member council.
   ``I'm on City Council because of the lawsuit and because of Mr.
LeRoy,'' said Councilman Ernest McGowen, a black retired postal
worker elected in 1979.
   As recently as last week, LeRoy worked in the county's voter
registration office, said Carl Smith, Harris County's tax
assessor-collector. He died over the weekend.
   LeRoy came to Houston in 1914, working for 15 to 20 cents an
hour digging sewer ditches. He later worked for Southern Pacific
Railroad for 47 years, where as president of the Brotherhood of
Railway and Airline Clerks, he fought both the railroad management
and its union over discriminatory work rules.
   LeRoy was an executive board member of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People local chapter and was its
president for 30 years.
   LeRoy is survived by his wife, Erma, a daughter, two
grandchildren and a great-grandson. Funeral services were scheduled
Saturday.

<HEAD>Soviets Still a Major Power in Asia, Cheney Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, preparing to ask
the United States' Pacific allies to contribute more toward their
own defense, said Tuesday that the Soviet Union remains a
formidable power in the area.
   ``What it may be losing in numbers it is gaining back in terms
of more modern, capable ships and advanced weaponry,'' Cheney told
the Pacific and Asian Affairs Council.
   The Soviet Foreign Ministry announced last month that it was
withdrawing some of the MiG-23 fighters and Tu-16 bombers stationed
at Cam Ranh Bay, described by U.S. military sources as the Soviets'
largest foreign base.
   Reminding his listeners of the ``profound shock'' felt when the
Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, Cheney argued that the United States
must maintain its military strength to remain a global power and to
protect its interests in the Pacific.
   He said that 35 percent of America's world trade is with east
Asian and Pacific nations.
   From Hawaii, Cheney was heading for South Korea and discussions
with officials about increasing their support for the 43,000 U.S.
troops stationed there.
   In all, Cheney is spending two weeks in the Pacific, meeting
with representatives of Hong Kong, the Philippines and Japan in
light of congressional pressure for paring the defense budget and
for larger allied contributions to the costs of keeping U.S. forces
in Asia.
   Cheney said South Korea contributes $300 million a year to
maintaining the U.S. force there. The Seoul government, on the
other had,n has estimated its share of the U.S. expenses at more
than $2 billion.
   Cheney arranged for a special State Department representative to
accompany him as he asks allies with booming economies to kick in
more toward the cost of maintaining U.S. forces in Asia.
   The defense secretary noted that the Soviets maintain more than
a half-million ground troops in Asia, dozens of air divisions and
one of its largest naval fleets, numbering more than 260 ships and
submarines.
   Overall, there are 120,000 U.S. troops in Asia and Hawaii, a
force some members of Congress say is too large.
   On Tuesday, Cheney said that while he had no plans to
``dramatically alter our posture in the Pacific,'' he could not
rule out prospects for adjustments in our deployments or in the
overall size of our forces.''

<HEAD>Pro-Choice Union Forces Worried Over AFL-CIO's Delay on Abortion</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A decision by AFL-CIO officials to skip a vote
on abortion at next week's annual meeting may mean the federation's
hierarchy ultimately will remain neutral on the issue, pro-choice
union leaders say.
   Others, such as Duke McVey, president of the Missouri State
Labor Council AFL-CIO, say the abortion issue ``has nothing to do
with 40 hours a week or 20 bucks an hour.''
   ``We have enough to say grace over without taking on the
abortion issue. It splits our members and it doesn't address wages,
hours or conditions of employment,'' McVey said.
   Jay Foreman, executive vice president of the United Food and
Commerical Workers International Union, said the question is
whether the union hierarchy wants ``to take any risks.''
   ``The majority of them are male,'' he said. ``They're not
children; they're getting up there in years and are kind of fixed
in their attitudes. They may not want to bite on this.''
   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland has told the federation's
33-member Executive Council, which meets next week in Bal Harbour,
Fla., that he wants a committee to determine whether the federation
should take a pro-choice stand or stay neutral. There is no
organized move to condemn abortion.
   Three of the council's 33 members are women.
   Some pro-choice union forces say that if the council chooses to
stay on the sidelines _ as the AFL-CIO has been urged in a national
Right to Life letter-writing campaign _ organized labor's efforts
to attract women will be damaged.
   ``If they're going to keep the women and minorities active,
they're going to have to come out of the Dark Ages,'' Arlene
Collins, first vice president of the Oregon AFL-CIO, said Tuesday.
   Many union officials, regardless of their position on abortion,
agree that organizing women and minorities are key if labor is to
reverse the loss in stature it suffered in the 1980s.
   Collins said she is concerned that if the council continues to
delay taking a stand, as it has done for more than a decade, the
issue won't have as much impact on the 1990 politial races.
   But others say abortion won't serve as a litmus test for
candidates.
   ``It's not critical to the election cycle. We're not a single
issues group,'' Foreman said.
   Still, he and other pro-choice labor leaders think the AFL-CIO
should commit on the issue because they say abortion has workplace
ramifications, such as affecting the economic well-being of working
women and raising questions of health-care coverage and the ability
of health-care workers to do their job.
   McVey said a number of rank-and-file union members ``feel very
strongly about the issue. They don't support their union doing that
kind of activity and they don't want to pay dues to a union that
does.''
   Yet several pro-choice union leaders noted the AFL-CIO
historically has gotten involved in issues not directly related to
collective bargaining, such as civil rights, gay rights and school
busing.
   Delegates from all 90 AFL-CIO unions declined last fall to adopt
any of the half dozen pro-choice resolutions submitted, referring
them to the Executive Council.
   Adoption of such a resolution would put the federation in line
with the stance taken by many of its political allies, such as the
Democratic Party and various women's and civil rights groups.
   William Wynn, president of the UFCW and a pro-choice member of
the council, will chair the committee that will determine whether
the federation should take a position.
   Kirkland has not given the committee a deadline, but Wynn
predicted it ``will be able to come to a definitive conclusion that
will be responsive to everybody's feelings, everybody's emotions.''

   Dominican Republic President Joaquin Balaguer,
who is considering bid for a sixth term in May, was undergoing
tests Tuesday at The Methodist Hospital.
   If Balaguer gets a clean bill of health, he has said he would be
a candidate for the May 16 election.
   Balaguer arrived in Houston on Monday, hospital spokeswoman
Brenda Koch said.
   ``He is a patient here, but he has asked that we not release
anything about him,'' she said. Results of his checkup by heart
surgeon Michael DeBakey may be released Tuesday, she said.
   Balaguer, 83, suffers from glaucoma and is nearly blind. Still,
he is considered energetic, alert and politically astute. He has
published more than 20 books.
   The May election is the most important in the Caribbean this
year and would pit Balaguer against 80-year-old nemesis Juan Bosch,
a leftist man of letters whose election in 1963 led to the U.S.
invasion of the county in 1965. Bosch has been ahead in recent
polls.
   Balaguer was first elected in 1965, four years after dictator
Gen. Rafael Trujillo was assassinated. Balaguer served under
Trujillo in a variety of posts for nearly 30 years, but never was
implicated in corruption associated with the Trujillo regime.
   He recently has been criticized for a multimillion-dollar public

   Women-only Chatham College is considering
admitting men for the first time _ at least partly to attract women.
   Trustee Louis B. Barnes said one factor behind Monday's proposal
was apprehension that young women would look elsewhere for their
education. He called the process of getting 18-year-old women to
apply to a female-only college a ``tough sell.''
   ``There's a so-called stigma attached to a single-sex college,''
Barnes said. ``Many modern young women choose to go to coed
colleges. They are at least as interested in their social existence
as their academic existence.''
   Chatham's Board of Trustees approved a resolution, backed by
President Rebecca Stafford, which would open the doors of the
school to men next year for the first time. The proposal came from
the board's long-range planning committee, which includes faculty
and alumnae.
   A final decision will be made at the board's spring meeting in
April.
   ``We've increased enrollment. We want to increase it even more,
especially traditional-aged students,'' Ms. Stafford said. ``We
want to increase the student body so we can offer more courses.''
   Chatham College was founded in 1869. It has about 650 women
enrolled.

   And now, with the latest in sports,
here's ... Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell.
   The Maine Democrat, known in the nation's capital for his
scholarly, measured political arguments, tried his hand at
television sportscasting Tuesday, going on the air live with
stories about heavyweight boxing, tennis and other sports on
WCSH-TV.
   ``That was fun,'' Mitchell said after stepping off the set. He
appeared on the noon news as a ``celebrity sportscaster'' with his
brother, John, the assistant men's basketball coach at Colby
College in their home town of Waterville.
   George Mitchell led the sports segment with a story on the
controversy surrounding the Douglas-Tyson fight in Tokyo this
weekend.
   ``The president of the World Boxing Council says there never was
any doubt that James `Buster' Douglas beat Mike Tyson, fair and
square,'' the Senate majority leader said, reading from a script
prepared by WCSH's regular writers. Mitchell then reported on
tennis player Steffi Graf's recovery from a thumb injury before
cutting to his brother for a report on professional basketball.
   He's been interested in sports for years, Mitchell said, and is
scheduled to be grand marshal in next week's Daytona 500 national
stock car race.
   How does sportscasting compare with Senate debate?
   ``They're both fun, but in different ways,'' said Mitchell, who
has no plans to dump politics for sportscasting full-time.

   Six of seven 1990-model autos so far tested
appear unlikely to protect drivers from head injuries in a
35-mile-per-hour crash, the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration said Tuesday.
   Only the Acura Integra four-door sedan appears able to protect
from driver head injuries, the agency said. The Toyota 4-Runner
four-door truck ranked worst among models tested.
   Besides the Acura and Toyota models, tests have been conducted
on the Chevrolet Lumina, the Mazda Miata, the Nissan Stanza, the
Lexus ES250 and the Mitsubishi Eclipse.
   Some carmakers have criticized the government's testing, which
uses instrument-equipped dummies. The manufacturers contend the
tests to not accurately reflect highway crash conditions.
   The safety agency continues testing throughout the year until
all models are covered.
   Dummies in the tests are secured by seat belts and, if
available, air bags. Instruments are designed to measure potential
head, chest and upper leg injuries to an average-sized adult male.
   Each car is given a head-injury rating. Scores below 750
indicate that head injury is unlikely, between 750 and 1,250 that
it is possible and above 1,250 that it is likely.
   Here are the models tested so far and their head injury scores:
   Toyota 4-Runner four-door, 1,306; Chevrolet Lumina four-door,
1,200; Nissan Stanza four-door, 1,105; Lexus ES250 four-door, 992;
Mazda Miata two-door convertible, 920; Mitsubishi Eclipse two-door

<HEAD>Senator Criticizes ``Pension Raiding'' By Corporations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY MASSEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum on Tuesday criticized
``pension raiding'' by corporations that terminate employee
retirement plans to gain surplus assets and turn over the pensions
to companies holding junk bonds.
   ``Pension raids leave workers and retirees with frozen pension
checks while their employers lugh their way to the bank with
millions of dollars,'' said Metzenbaum, an Ohio Democrat.
   Metzenbaum's comments came as his Senate labor subcommittee held
a hearing on pension terminations and the potential risks from
companies establishing replacement retirement programs with
annuities bought from insurance companies heavily invested in
high-risk ``junk bonds.''
   Annuities are contracts that pay fixed monthly benefits to
retirees.
   Surplus pension assets have become a popular target for
corporate raiders who acquire a company and use its retirement
programs as a source of cash.
   Metzenbaum focused on a proposal by the Kansas-based Coleman Co.
to terminate employee pension funds valued at $83 million and a
scrapped deal to buy annuities from First Executive Corp., a
California insurance holding company hit by financial downturns
from turmoil in the junk-bond market.
   He also cited the takeover of California-based Pacific Lumber
Co. in 1986 by Maxxam Group Inc., which replaced an employee
pension fund with an annuity bought from First Executive and took
control of about $50 million in surplus pension assets.
   ``We are very worried about our pension and feel we didn't get a
fair deal,'' Pacific Lumber worker Lester Reynolds, of Fortuna,
Calif., told the panel.
   Metzenbaum said the subcommittee would consider legislation to
impose tighter standards on pension terminations and provide
greater protection for retirement benefits.
   ``Too often, sound pension plans are wrung dry of their cash and
replaced with annuities offering fixed benefits and no chance of
cost-of-living adjustments,'' Metzenbaum said. ``These annuities
are backed by an under-regulated insurance industry that plays fast
and loose with everything from accounting methods to capital
standards.''
   Metzenbaum suggested that Coleman's corporate parent, MacAndrews
&amp; Forbes Holding Inc., had a potential conflict of interest in
doing business with First Executive and may have violated federal
standards in failing to adequately safeguard the interests of
retirees.
   First Executive, Metzenbaum said, had $310 million in bonds of
Revlon Inc., a subsidiary of MacAndrews &amp; Forbes.
   Coleman officials said they had acted properly.
   ``It is my belief ... that the company has acted in every step
in good faith and with full appreciation of applicable fiduciary
obligations,'' said Coleman president Larry Jones.
   Coleman was acquired in April by MacAndrews &amp; Forbes, controlled
by takeover specialist Ronald O. Perelman. Wichita-based Coleman is
one of the world's largest makers of outdoor recreation equipment.
   Because Coleman's pension plans are overfunded, MacAndrews &amp;
Forbes will be able to take up to $32 million in surplus money for
its own use by terminating the pensions and setting up an annuity
program.
   A MacAndrews &amp; Forbes official said the surplus would be closer
to $20 million after taxes, and that all of the money would be
reinvested to expand and modernize Coleman, finance a new employee
retirement savings program and develop new products and markets.
   ``Our retirees will not suffer one penny's loss as a result of
this transaction,'' said Howard Gittis, vice chairman of New
York-based MacAndrews &amp; Forbes.
   Coleman has scuttled its deal with First Executive and officials
told the subcommittee that it had secured the return of a $45
million ``premium deposit.''
   Coleman officials said they would proceed with their termination
plan but would buy annuities from an insurance company carrying the
highest rating of claims-paying ability.

<HEAD>Cambridge Candy Company Churns Out Conversation Hearts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Only the messages have changed on those
familiar Valentine's Day staples: conversation hearts. ``Skidoo''
and ``Oh You Kid'' have given way to ``Luv ya'' and ``Let's Rock.''
   The medium _ small, colored candy hearts _ remains the same.
   The New England Confectionery Company, better known as Necco,
originated ``conversation hearts'' at the turn of the century. It
ceased production in 1920 but revived them six years ago when
company officials decided they had become popular again.
   Today, it's Valentine's Day year-round at the company's huge,
nondescript building. Necco churns out 1.7 billion conversation
hearts a year and is believed to be the leader among several
companies that make them.
   ``I think people today, in spite of what they say about them,
are more interested in talking about their thoughts and feelings
than we ever were,'' said Charles Welsford, systems manager of the
Necco company.
   ``Candy has long been a way of expression between people. People
love conversation hearts,'' he said Tuesday.
   Necco makes the hearts on the same machines that produced them
in the early 1900s. On one floor of the sprawling plant, dozens of
white uniformed employees scurry around a maze of huge vats of
sugar, rollers and conveyor belts.
   Necco, which also makes chocolates and a series of candy bars,
makes conversation hearts from the same ingredients as its famous
Necco wafers _ a mixture of sugar, corn syrup and dextrose.
   It's a simple process. The conversation hearts are almost 100
percent sugar, which is blended into a paste in large troughs. The
mixture is then rolled onto a conveyor belt like a blanket, where a
printing mechanism engraves the sayings onto the paste. A cutter
mold, which operates at 145 strokes a minute, cuts out 37 hearts
per stroke during each eight-hour shift.
   The tiny hearts are the most popular but Necco also makes a
slightly larger version as well.
   ``I know they're popular because it's not even Valentine's Day
and we're already out of them,'' Jean Philippe Simonet, manager of
the Fanny Farmer candy shop in Boston, said Tuesday.
   Necco employee Anthony Staropoli says he never tires of them,
and he's been working at the plant for 43 years.
   ``People are crazy for them,'' said Staropoli. ``When they hear
I work here, I have to give bags to everyone.''
   Welsford said Necco's approximately 700 employees are asked to
contribute ideas for the messages printed on the hearts. A total of
25 phrases are chosen _ none of which will win awards for ingenuity
or cleverness. A sampling: ``Dig Me,'' ``Stay Loose,'' ``Buzz Off''
``Cool'' or ``Far Out.''
   But Welsford defends them, pointing out that ``any of them can
be given to any youngster without explanation.''
   And yes, some of the hearts contain that one message that hasn't
changed over the years and never needs an explanation: ``I Love
You.''

<HEAD>Trump vs. Trump: The War</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The big question Tuesday in the society soap
opera of Trump vs. Trump was a legal one: How solid is a prenuptial
agreement between Donald and Ivana?
   Under it, Mrs. Trump would be limited to custody of their three
children, their Greenwich, Conn., mansion and $25 million.
   But Donald Trump is worth $1.7 billion, by Fortune magazine's
estimate, and New York Post gossip columnist Cindy Adams reported
that Ivana Trump wants $150 million, the Plaza Hotel and her
husband's 727 jetliner.
   The real estate magnate and his wife signed an agreement before
their marriage 13 years ago limiting Ivana's share in case of a
divorce. The agreement was updated at least twice, the last time
two years ago.
   Last summer Ivana asked the prominent divorce lawyer Raoul
Felder whether the agreement could be broken. He told her to forget
it.
   ``The law doesn't protect you from making a bad deal,'' Felder
said this week, adding that the Trumps' agreement ``isn't even
prenuptial; it's postnuptial.''
   New York courts are known for their respect for prenuptial
agreements, in the absence of evidence that there was not a full
and fair disclosure of the assets at stake.
   But Mrs. Trump's lawyer, Michael Kennedy, said, ``We do not
consider the so-called prenuptial agreement to be serious. It will
have no relevance to a court because it is unconscionable and
fraudulent.''
   And Adams, who says she has known Trump ``when he was straight
out of school and in his early dating days,'' asked, ``Who of us
knows what properties could have been undervalued or overvalued for
varying purposes, right?''
   Her conclusion: ``Donald knows he's about to get hit.''
   Trump's spokesman was adamant: ``The prenuptial agreement signed
by Donald and Ivana Trump is a long and detailed document which
covers all aspects and is 100 percent enforceable in courts of
law.''
   Trump, in Wilmington, Del., on Tuesday to promote the second
Tour de Trump bicycle race, repeatedly said ``no questions'' when
asked to comment on the breakup.
   Asked later if he planned to rename the helicopter that bears
his wife's name, the developer laughed heartily but refused to
comment.
   Although published reports had linked Trump romantically to a
number of women, actress Marla Maples moved ahead Tuesday as the
New York tabloid newspapers' favorite candidate for the role of the
other woman.
   In an Aspen, Colo., restaurant over the holidays, Mrs. Trump
reportedly warned Maples to stay away from her husband.
   Maples reportedly told her: ``I love him and if you don't, why
don't you let him go?''
   A source who had heard a firsthand account of the meeting told
the Post that Mrs. Trump cursed at the actress and mispronounced
her name as ``Moolah.''
   Trump told his wife afterward, ``You're overreacting.''
   Other Trump allegations, reports and rumors filled the tabloids:
   _Donald had Ivana locked out of her office Monday at the Plaza
Hotel, but then let her in.
   _Donald and Ivana had an hour-long meeting alone at the hotel.
   _Some of Ivana's jewelry was missing and she suspected Donald
took it from their vault.
   The headline writers did their bit, with ``Ivana Be Alone''
(Newsday), ``Ivana Better Deal'' (Daily News) and ``Gimme the
Plaza'' (Post). The News used the overline ``Trump: the War'' over
its three pages of Trump coverage.
   Even Leona Helmsley, the self-described hotel queen, got into
the act.
   ``He's obsessed with me, isn't he?'' Mrs. Helmsley said to a
reporter. ``Then why would he push her (Ivana) to be just like me _
to run his hotels? Really!''
   Donald had been quoted as telling a source that Ivana's ``level
of arrogance has grown steadily worse in recent years. The bottom
line is I don't want to create another Leona Helmsley.''
   Mrs. Helmsley, who was recently convicted of tax evasion, was
described at her trial as ill-tempered and demanding.
   ``I have told Ivana, `Whatever Leona would do, do the opposite.
Be nice to everybody.' And she is nice, anyway,'' Trump said in an
interview published in the March issue of Playboy magazine.

<HEAD>Dry Soil, Lack of Snow Cover Still Threaten Winter Wheat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dry soil conditions and lack of snow cover in
parts of the Great Plains continue to threaten winter wheat, the
government's Joint Agricultural Weather Facility said Tuesday.
   ``Portions of the southern Great Plains received some moisture
but more was needed,'' the facility said in its report for the week
of Feb. 4-10. ``Most of the central and northern Great Plains
remained dry, but above-normal temperatures helped to maintain crop
condition.''
   The facility is operated by the department's of Agriculture and
Commerce. The weekly reports cover soil and crop conditions but do
not project yields.
   Looking at some other crops, the report said the sugarcane
harvest continued in Florida, but that ``unseasonably hot, dry
weather forced citrus producers to continue irrigating.''
   The warm weather also continued over the major Florida vegetable
areas where spring plantings were under way.
   In Georgia, tobacco plant beds were reported in ``good to
excellent'' condition and that North Carolina farmers continued to
seed their beds.
   ``Rain and wet field conditions again limited field work in the
Delta,'' the report said. ``Land preparation for the 1990 cotton
crop continued in Arizona and California.''
   Livestock pastures were helped by rain and mild temperatures in
the Delta and Southeast, the report said.
   ``In the Great Plains and Corn Belt, mild temperatures and the
lack of snow cover reduced the amount of supplemental feeding
necessary (for livestock),'' the report said. ``Mild weather
provided ideal conditions for calving, which was under way in many
areas.''

   A survey has shown that 58 percent
of West Germans and 92 percent of East Germans questioned want
military neutrality for a unified Germany, a magazine said Tuesday.
   The survey also showed overwhelming support for Berlin as the
capital of a single Germany, the Munich-based weekly magazine Quick
said.
   The survey, which questioned 3,599 Germans _ 2,170 in West
Germany and 1,429 in East Germany _ was conducted for the magazine
by the Tuebingen-based Wickert Institute.
   Seven percent of the East Germans and 42 percent of the West
Germans questioned would want a unified Germany to be a NATO
member, the survey said.
   Only 1 percent of East Germans questioned would favor continued
membership in the Warsaw Pact, according to the survey.
   Support for Berlin as the capital was overwhelming. The survey
said that 91 percent of East Germans questioned want Berlin as the
government seat of a unified Germany. East Berlin already is the
capital of East Germany, although the United States, France and
Britain say that status violates post-war agreements.
   Sixty-seven percent of West Germans questioned favor moving the
capital from Bonn to Berlin, in the event of unification, according
to the survey.
   No margin of error was given and the magazine did not say how
the poll was conducted last week.

   President Bush may use the four-nation drug
summit to revive the idea _ shunned in Latin America _ of using
U.S. military forces to cast a ``radar net'' over Colombia to track
cocaine-carrying aircraft, a senior adviser said Tuesday.
   Brent Scowcroft, Bush's national security adviser, said the idea
was ``on the shelf for the moment'' because Colombian officials
balked last year at news reports that the United States was
considering a naval ``blockade'' of their ports.
   Scowcroft said the plan probably would not win approval ``in the
next several days'' _ the summit is Thursday _ but he added that
``it's an idea we think has merit.'' He said, ``I expect it might
be discussed'' at the summit.
   Another administration official, speaking anonymously, played
down the sensitive subject, calling it ``not a significant agenda
item.''
   Bush, after a pre-dawn flight from Washington on Thursday, will
join the leaders of Colombia, Bolivia and Peru in the coastal
resort of Cartagena for six hours of drug-fighting talks.
   The summit site, at a heavily guarded naval base isolated on a
peninsula, was selected to provide maximum protection in a nation
torn by drug-related violence.
   Underscoring the hazards, police reported Tuesday that leftist
guerrillas had kidnapped two Americans in the drug capital of
Medellin, Colombia, to protest Bush's visit. They were identified
as David Kent, a teacher from Indianapolis, and James Donnelly,
employed by a company that manufactures hydraulic equipment.
   Colombian authorities say about 5,000 security agents will be on
hand for the presidents' protection at the summit.
   To bolster security, two American warships have been deployed in
the Caribbean, along with a Colombian escort ship.
   The U.S. vessels are the USS Nassau, an 820-foot amphibious
assault ship which carries helicopters and a Marine landing team,
and the USS Sampson, a 437-foot destroyer armed with missiles and
two five-inch guns.
   Acknowledging risks involved in the trip, Scowcroft said, ``It's
an unusual situation because there are in Colombia these guerrilla
bands, terrorist bands with access to funds to purchase ... any
kinds of arms, and so naturally there are unusual circumstances.''
   However, he said, ``All the agencies involved in presidential
security are comfortable with the arrangements.''
   In preparation for the summit, Bush called in senior advisers in
the drug war, including Attorney General Dick Thornburgh; drug
policy director William Bennett; CIA Director William Webster; Drug
Enforcement Administration Director John Lawn; Gen. Colin Powell,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Trade Representative Carla
Hills and Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan.
   Bush also signed a new United Nations compact aimed at helping
curb international drug traffic and urged other nations to do the
same, ``to join us in working together to rid the world of this
menace, the menace from drugs.''
   The United States is the fifth nation to ratify the agreement
tentatively approved by 76 countries. The U.N. Convention Against
Illegal Traffic in Narcotic Drugs calls upon all nations to make
illegal the production, cultivation and transportation of narcotics
and other dangerous drugs.
   It also calls for tighter controls on chemicals used in drug
production and sets up guidelines for extraditing drug offenders,
seizing drug-tainted assets and curbing money laundering.
   Scowcroft, at a briefing on the summit, said the United States
never planned a naval blockade of Colombia.
   Instead, he said the plan envisioned using offshore facilities
to erect a radar screen ``that will give the Colombians the ability
to target where the loaded plans are coming from, going up to North
America and where the empty planes are coming back in, and so
forth.''
   Scowcroft said, ``We would be interested in improved cooperation
in that kind of interdiction.'' A day earlier, Bush said, ``What
I'd like to convince them is we can be extraordinarily helpful,
particularly, to Colombia in their courageous fight against
narco-traffickers by a sophisticated interdiction effort.''
   Scowcroft said the four leaders will sign a communique covering
U.S. economic assistance to the Andean nations, as well as aid from
international financial institutions.
   It also will call for reducing the demand for drugs in the
United States, curbing U.S. export of chemicals such as ether used
to manufacture cocaine from coca leaves, and will deal with the
export of U.S. weapons to the region and with money laundering, he
said.
   Commenting on a dispute with Colombia concerning coffee and
cut-flower trade, Scowcroft offered little hope that progress would
be made on resolving such disagreements at the drug summit.
   Later, however, Bennett said the subjects were open to
discussion.
   Colombian President Virgilio Barco has complained to Bush that
the U.S. Commerce Department is engaged in a trade procedure
against Colombian flower growers that could result in big tariffs
on Colombian-grown cut flowers.
   Scowcroft said there is nothing the administration can do about
the matter, which he described as a regulatory procedure taken
after U.S. flower growers protested that Colombia was ``dumping''
flowers in this country at below-fair-market prices.

   Civilians fled on foot through deep snow
Tuesday to escape a ski resort area they fear will be the next
battleground of the rival armies fighting for control of Lebanon's
Christian territory.
   Kesrouan province in the mountains north of Beirut is noted for
both summer and winter resorts, but also is the main stronghold of
Samir Geagea and his Lebanese Forces, the largest Christian militia.
   Michel Aoun, the rebel general whose 19,000 soldiers been trying
to destroy Geagea for more than two weeks, described the militia as
``an unacceptable tumor in our body'' and called up reserves and
volunteers.
   Police said Aoun was massing troops along Kesrouan's eastern
flank and its southern coastal area near Jounieh, a port 12 miles
north of Beirut, for an apparent two-pronged thrust.
   His troopers and Geagea's militiamen fought intermittent
artillery and mortar duels Tuesday in Christian east Beirut and in
Kesrouan.
   Aoun's command reported 15 soldiers in combat in two days and
police said 18 corpses were taken from the streets of east Beirut,
where snipers are active.
   At least 513 people have been killed and 1,724 wounded since the
battle began Jan. 30, according to police figures.
   Snow was 20 inches deep in the mountains Tuesday and more was
falling. Police said dozens of exhausted civilians slogged to
villages away from the potential field of battle.
   ``Many civilians have reached central Kesrouan, with cases of
exhaustion after crossing the deep valleys on foot,'' said a police
spokesman, whose name cannot be used under standing regulations.
   ``Unfortunately, there is nothing we can do to help. We can't
send patrols to evacuate them because bridges have been blown up
and other narrow roads have been either mined or blocked by snow.''
   In an attempt to limit Aoun's ability to maneuver, militiamen
have blown up all bridges linking the mountains he controls in the
east to central and western Kesrouan, the spokesman said.
   Geagea's men also have planted antitank mines along most narrow
mountain roads in the province to block any advance.
   Aoun, who commands about 19,000 men, said he was willing to give
Geagea a political role in the 310-square-mile Christian enclave
north and east of Beirut, but also indicated he was ready for a
showdown.
   He said army would be the only armed group permitted to operate
in the enclave, where 1 million Christians live.
   ``They are welcome if they want political responsibility,'' Aoun
told a news conference at his headquarters bunker beneath the
shattered presidential palace in Baabda, a Christian suburb east of
Beirut.
   ``They should be integrated into an official apparatus,'' he
said. ``They are an unacceptable tumor in our body,'' Aoun said,
but added: ``We are ready to give them a chance. In times of major
crisis, one should be ready to take valiant decisions to avoid more
victims and more tragedies.''
   Aoun has retained his command in defiance of President Elias
Hrawi, who dismissed him as army chief after being elected in
November with a mandate to implement a peace plan designed to end
the 15-year-old civil war. The general rejects the peace plan and
refuses to leave the presidential palace.
   His remarks Tuesday about the Lebanese Forces amounted to a
restatement of conditions he outlined when the battle began, that
the militia be disbanded transformed into a political party.
   Geagea has rejected the offer as ``an effort to eliminate us.''
He noted that his militia, which has about 6,000 regulars and
thousands of reservists, has fought Lebanese Moslems, Palestinians
and Syrians during the long civil war.
   Aoun accused the Lebanese Forces of ``stabbing the army in the
back'' and said his forces had ``achieved the minimum we are
capable of doing.'' His reference was to the battle for the
strategic Dbaye Hills north of Beirut, which his men captured early
last week.

   Schools closed for a week by a racial protest
reopened Tuesday amid heavy security, including 200 National
Guardsmen sent by Gov. Guy Hunt. Absenteeism was high but officials
reported no classroom problems.
   About 150 black student protesters boycotted Selma High School
and marched around a flagpole chanting ``Shut 'em down! No
school!'' before the opening bell. Another two dozen protesters
continued a sit-in at City Hall for a seventh day. Outside some
carried signs saying ``Equality! Education!''
   ``This is the first time troopers have been used to ensure that
whites could go to school,'' said Jamie Wallace, executive director
of the Selma chamber of commerce.
   The protest, prompted by the dismissal of the city's first black
school superintendent by white school board members, was less
strident than in recent days when throngs of black demonstrators
rekindled images of historic Selma marches in the 1960s.
   The superintendent, Norward Roussell, who was reinstated last
week, called for racial unity Tuesday. But he said he doubted the
conflict will end ``until there is some movement on my contract,''
which expires in June.
   His supporters contend he is being dismissed because of his race
and action he took on behalf of black students, not because of an
alleged lack of managerial skills cited in an evaluation. He has
held the $80,000 post for 2{ years.
   Protesters also want the school board, with six whites and five
blacks, to be elected rather than appointed by the City Council,
which has five whites and four blacks. The city is 52 percent black.
   ``It saddens me that children have to be pulled into a political
and racial conflict that should have been solved years ago, after
the Edmund Pettus Bridge,'' said Roussell. He referred to the Selma
bridge where marchers were clubbed by state troopers in 1965 in
what became known as ``Bloody Sunday,'' a milestone in the drive
for equal rights.
   Hunt agreed to dispatch 200 military police from National Guard
reserve ranks to join an undisclosed number of state troopers and
local police in guarding Selma's 11 public schools, which closed
Feb. 7 amid rising racial tensions. The system, with 5,971
students, is about 70 percent black, and some white parents have
moved their children to private schools or other systems during the
past week.
   ``There is no reason for all this security, because they didn't
come here to be violent,'' said Dallas County Commissioner Perry
Varner, a black protest leader who was arrested in a melee in the
mayor's office last week.
   Roussell said about 23 percent of the students were absent
Tuesday. He said he had predicted 30 percent would stay home
because of uncertainty over the school environment.
   ``Both black and white parents seriously want their chidren back
in schools,'' said Roussell, who has opposed student boycotts even
when they were conducted in support of him. ``I want to commend
parents, both black and white, for sending their children back to
school. We don't need a superintendent over empty schools and
classrooms.''
   He said the situation in the schools was ``reasonably calm,''
with two boys, both black, in a shoving match at a middle school.
He said 54 students were withdrawn from schools Tuesday, but he
believes most will return ``once they see we're open and things are
going smoothly.''
   ``I want to emphasize that we're not having a mass exodus of
whites from our schools,'' he said.
   The protesting students marched about a mile to the high school
Tuesday morning, and at one point the marchers had a brief
confrontation with state troopers.
   Several troopers told the marchers they needed to stay away from
the school, prompting the marchers to stop and pray, with troopers
taking off their hats during the prayer. The students then moved
through the troopers, who did not try to physically restrain them
as the students went to the flagpole.

<HEAD>Secret Police Say More than 750,000 People Shot from 1930-53</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 750,000 people were shot to death as
enemies of the state during Stalin's 1930-53 reign of terror, the
KGB secret police said in a report Tuesday.
   The figure does not include the millions who died in labor camps
and prisons or in the famines during Stalin's collectivization of
agriculture, but it represented the first time the KGB has given a
figure for any of Stalin's victims.
   Many Western sources say that altogether more than 10 million
people were killed.
   Under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms, government
commissions and the KGB have been ordered to find the truth about
Stalin's terror and rehabilitate the victims.
   Gorbachev's KGB director, Vladimir A. Kryuchkov, has pledged to
never again permit the secret police to be involved in such
repression.
   The official Tass news agency quoted a KGB committee as saying a
review of its archives determined that 3,778,234 people had been
sentenced for counterrevolutionary activities or crimes against the
state from 1930 to 1953, when Stalin died.
   It said 786,098 of them, including many top state and party
leaders, scientists, military leaders and cultural figures, had
been shot to death.
   Most leading figures such as Bolshevik leader Nikolai I.
Bukharin, who was shot at the height of the terror in 1938, have
since been cleared of any crimes.
   The Tass report said the cases of more than 850,000 people had
been reconsidered by the KGB and the Soviet prosecutor's office the
past two years, and that all but about 12,000 had been cleared.
   The KGB said it was continuing to look for the mass graves where
Stalin's victims were buried to place memorials there. Such graves
have been uncovered in many regions of the country in recent years.
   But it charged that many local KGB offices were not helping
uncover the truth about innocent victims in their areas.
   The KGB has been trying to improve its public image and in
recent months it has gone on a publicity offensive, presenting some
of its top officers for a television call-in program and allowing a
film to be made about its operations.
   During the 1970s, the KGB harassed Soviet dissidents and now say
they were only carrying out the policies required of them at the
time.
   As the agency's role has changed in society, Kryuchkov has
called for closer cooperation between the KGB and intelligence
agencies in the West to fight drug trafficking and terrorism.

<HEAD>Lawsuit Against Bowie Thrown Out by Federal Judge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has dismissed a 2-year-old lawsuit
against rock star David Bowie filed by a woman who claimed he
sexually assaulted her.
   U.S. District Judge Sam Cummings on Monday threw out the lawsuit
filed by Wanda Lee Nichols, who accused Bowie of assaulting her in
his hotel room on Oct. 9, 1987, during a four-day concert stopover
in Dallas.
   Bowie conceded he had spent the night with Ms. Nichols, but
denied accusations he sexually assaulted her. A grand jury declined
to indict Bowie on Nov. 18, 1987.
   Ms. Nichols asked a judge to have Bowie tested to see if he
carried the AIDS virus, although her attorney had said she already
had tested negative for exposure to the virus herself.
   Bowie subsequently tested negative for AIDS in Switzerland and
mailed the results to Dallas.
   Dallas lawyer Daniel P. Callahan, who represented Bowie in the
suit, said the judge's decision to dismiss the lawsuit on Monday
was ``the appropriate result.''
   ``As far as I can tell, it was just a nuisance suit,'' Callahan
said.
   Ms. Nichols, a resident of suburban University Park, said she
would continue to press for monetary damages despite the judge's
decision. ``I'm not going to give up totally,'' she said.

   Federal job training programs fail to serve
enough Hispanics because of income and documentation barriers, a
government report said Tuesday.
   The National Commission for Employment Policy, an independent
agency that reports to Congress and the president, said the federal
Job Training Partnership Act needs to be amended so more Hispanics
will participate.
   The report, based on a 12-month study, called on Congress to
ease income requirements. It also asked the Labor Department to
urge states to loosen documentation requirements needed to get into
job training programs.
   While Hispanics account for between 13 percent and 14 percent of
those eligible for job training programs, they make up only between
10 percent and 11 percent of those who take part, the report said.
   The commission blamed part of the discrepancy on federal
requirements that mandate candidates for the program be receiving
food stamps. Many Hispanics refuse to accept public assistance and
therefore miss out on job training oppurtunities, the report said.
   ``Because of their cultural heritage of self-sufficiency and
attendant distaste for government assistance programs, many
Hispanics would rather forego JTPA training than accept food stamp
assistance just to qualify for the program,'' the agency said.
   The report recommended that Congress change the law so that
candidates merely be ``eligible'' for food stamps rather than
actually accepting the assistance.
   Under current law, receiving food stamps is one way to be
eligible for JTPA. There are also job training income cut-off
levels, which are higher, in some areas, than the food stamp
qualification.
   That means some working poor Hispanics have income levels that
fall between the two levels, which keeps them from meeting the JTPA
cut-off but qualifys them for food stamps.
   Congress needs to make the two income levels compatible, so that
Hispanics falling between the two income levels who choose not to
take food stamps can still receive job training, the report said.
   In addition, the commission said requirements on documents such
as birth certificates are overly restrictive in some areas, such as
Miami where there are a large number of political refugees.
   ``Maybe some of us still have our birth certificate sitting in a
drawer some place, but for these people, in order to get a birth
certificate, they have to get it from the very government they
fled,'' said Carol Romero, the staff economist who oversaw the
report.
   The Labor Department should urge states to consider ways to ease
documentation requirements, the report said.

   Moslem militants fighting for the
secession of Kashmir from India shot and killed the senior
television journalist in Srinagar on Tuesday as he returned home
from work, witnesses and officials said.
   Lassa Kaul, a Hindu and top executive in the Srinagar bureau of
the state-owned Doordarshan TV network, was shot three times when
he stepped from his jeep outside his home, said witnesses.
   Witnesses also said the body of Inspector Yashpal Sharma, an
intelligence officer, was found hanging from an almond tree Tuesday
near the town of Wahabpura, about nine miles west of Srinagar.
   They said Sharma, also a Hindu, was kidnapped from nearby
Chadura on Sunday night.
   Gov. Jagmohan of Jammu-Kashmir state told reporters, ``We have
no such report.''
   The witnesses spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The deaths would raise to 87 the number of people killed since
Jan. 20, when the government began a crackdown on the militants.
   Sixty-four percent of Jammu-Kashmir's 6 million people are
Moslem, making it the only Moslem-dominated state among the 25
states in overwhelmingly Hindu India. Nationwide, Moslems make up
12 percent of the 880 million population.
   Jagmohan, a Hindu who uses only one name, was named governor on
Jan. 18 and ordered the crackdown two days later.
   He said Tuesday that police and soldiers raided at least 15
houses believed to be militant hideouts in downtown Srinagar, but
said nothing of arrests.
   Police said two bomb explosions hit Srinagar on Tuesday during a
curfew relaxation, but no casualties were reported.
   A senior state administration official said intelligence reports
showed the militants had acquired rocket-launchers and missiles,
and military sources said they suspected plans for large-scale
sabotage were in the making.
   The official and sources spoke on condition of not being
identified.
   Kashmir was divided into Pakistan-held and India-controlled
districts by a cease-fire line after a war in 1948-49. A campaign
for secession for India began shortly after and turned violent in
recent years.
   A 1965 India-Pakistan war did not change the position, although
the cease-fire line was overwritten by a so-called line of actual
control.
   The latest round of violence flared Jan. 20 following the
government crackdown and the arrest of 250 suspected militants,
most of whom were later released.
   India says neighboring Pakistan trains and arms the militants
with a view to annexing the state. Pakistan denies it, but says it
upholds the Kashmiri people's right to self-determination.
   Border incidents killed up to six Pakistani demonstrators last
Sunday.

   James Earl Ray, serving a 99-year prison
sentence for killing civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.,
has filed for divorce from his wife of 12 years.
   In a petition filed Feb. 5 in Morgan County, Ray, 62, said only
that irreconcilable differences had developed between him and his
wife, Anna Sandhu Ray, 45.
   But relatives said Ray is upset because his wife has not visited
him in Brushy Mountain State Prison, west of Knoxville, for several
years.
   The Rays married in 1978. They met while she worked as an artist
for a Knoxville television station during Ray's trial for escaping
from Brushy Mountain.
   In October 1988, Mrs. Ray threatened to file for divorce, saying
Ray had cut her out of profits from a book he's writing about his
life, but she did not follow through.
   In an interview last month with the Nashville Banner, Mrs. Ray
said she still believed her husband was innocent of the King
slaying.
   Ray has contended he was framed to cover up an FBI assassination
plot to kill the civil rights leader, who was shot to death April
4, 1968, in Memphis.

   Opposition legislators shouted Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher down Tuesday when she defended easing sanctions
against South Africa, and the Labor Party leader called her
``absurd and arrogant.''
   More uproar came during question time in the House of Commons,
when a legislator said, referring to Mrs. Thatcher, ``If she'd just
spent 27 years in jail ...''
   ``And so she should!'' interjected Gerald Kaufman, Labor's
spokesman on foreign affairs.
   Neil Kinnock, the Labor Party leader, said Mrs. Thatcher was
``absurd and arrogant'' for seeking to ease sanctions that had to
support of Nelson Mandela, the black leader freed Sunday after
serving more than 27 years in prison.
   When Kinnock referred to Mandela's support for sanctions, Mrs.
Thatcher accused Labor of taking ``its instructions'' from the
African National Congress guerrilla organization. After loud
protests, Mrs. Thatcher withdrew the remark.
   ``Mr. Mandela also said he approved of armed struggle,'' she
said. ``I disagree with him on that and I disagree with him on the
present sanctions.''
   She remained standing for question time, sometimes trying to
shout above the noise and sometimes silent, as opposition
legislators yelled and jeered. Her own Conservative Party members
shouted back at Labor across the green leather benches of the
Commons.
   Speaker Bernard Weatherill called repeatedly for order.
   ``This sounds awful!'' he protested. ``I've never heard the
House behave in this way at question time.''
   Mrs. Thatcher said both the Labor Party and ANC believed in
comprehensive economic sanctions against South Africa's white
government, in the armed struggle against it and in widespread
nationalization of industry.
   ``Mr. Mandela naturally said he supports all three, in what I
would call his ritual speech,'' she said, referring to Mandela's
remarks Sunday to huge crowd in Cape Town. ``I believe he is making
very much better and more peaceful speeches during his (subsequent)
press conferences.''
   On Sunday, Mandela said the armed struggle and international
sanctions should continue until the white-led South African
government finally abolished apartheid.
   This month, Mrs. Thatcher will seek to get the 12-nation
European Community to drop a ban on new investment and on promoting
tourism to South Africa, both voluntary measures. She has hinted
she will go ahead alone if necessary.
   The prime minister says President F.W. de Klerk should be
rewarded for freeing Mandela and legalizing the ANC as a prelude to
negotiating a new constitution enfranchising blacks, who outnumber
South Africa's whites by more than 5 to 1.
   Her officials say de Klerk risks being ousted in a white
backlash unless he can show anxious South African whites some
response from the outside world.
   There is little support for Mrs. Thatcher's stance in the
European Community and President Bush is prevented by law from
lifting sanctions until specific reforms are adopted.
   In the Commons, she said: ``President Bush has made clear that
he does not think that sanctions are necessarily right answer in
this situation. He is bound by a law passed by Congress. In so far
as we are bound by laws, we will be.''
   The European Community has banned member states from importing
iron, steel or gold coins to South Africa and from exporting oil to
it. The United States, European Community and Japan are South
Africa's major trading partners.

   A woman was jailed for civil contempt of court
Tuesday after refusing to testify before a federal grand jury
investigating Mayor Marion Barry.
   U.S. District Judge John Garrett Penn granted immunity from
prosecution to Maria McCarthy, of Greensboro, N.C., after she
initially refused to discuss Barry with the grand jury, said her
attorney, Leslie Scherr.
   When she still declined to testify, she was ordered jailed, said
Scherr.
   The grand jury is investigating Barry's ties to former city
employee Charles Lewis, who has cooperated with the panel after
pleading guilty to two cocaine conspiracy charges. Lewis testified
in open court that he supplied Barry with crack cocaine.
   The federal investigation began in December 1988 after city
police aborted an undercover drug purchase from Lewis when they
discovered that Barry was in his downtown Washington hotel room.
   Barry, who is enrolled in a Florida substance abuse treatment
center after being arrested Jan. 18 on a misdemeanor cocaine
possession charge, has denied using drugs with Lewis.
   In another development Tuesday, U.S. Magistrate Deborah Robinson
ruled that Barry does not have to undergo a urinalysis while he is
at the Florida clinic. However, the magistrate said that Barry must
be tested within 12 hours of his departure from the clinic in West
Palm Beach.
   Weekly tests were a condition of Barry's original release from
custody on Jan. 19. The U.S. Attorney's Office submitted a motion
on Monday asking that Barry leave the clinic to be tested weekly at
a court-approved facility. Authorities said that Barry had not been
tested at the clinic since his arrival on Jan. 22.
   Scherr said McCarthy explained her decision not to testify by
telling him, ``I have to live with myself, whether he was a friend
or enemy, we had a relationship that doesn't need public scrutiny.''
   The attorney declined to say whether McCarthy had been referring
to Barry, but two city government sources said that Barry and
McCarthy had had a personal relationship.
   Scherr said McCarthy had authorized him to reveal that she knows
Rasheeda Moore, the woman who cooperated with the FBI sting
operation that resulted in Barry's arrest. Scherr declined to
provide further details about McCarthy's connection to Moore or the
mayor.
   McCarthy is the second woman jailed for civil contempt for
refusing to discuss her relationship with Barry. Karen Johnson
served eight months in jail in 1984.
   Under law, McCarthy can be hel in jail as long as the grand jury
hearing evidence in the case remains in session. Grand juries are
normally empaneled for 18 months at a time, but can be extended if
the case continues.

<HEAD>Snow On Northern Plains And Rockies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cold air from the Arctic forced its way southward across the
nation Tuesday, generating high wind and stirring up snow from the
Pacific Northwest to the northern Plains.
   A wind chill advisory was posted for Missoula County in
west-central Montana, where strong easterly wind produced dangerous
wind chills.
   Livingston, Mont., reported a wind chill reading of 44 degrees
below zero in the afternoon, and Duluth, Minn., had a wind chill
reading of 43 below zero.
   Temperatures were below freezing at midday from the northern and
central high Plains to Upper Michigan and northern Lower Michigan,
and below zero across parts of Montana, North Dakota and Minnesota.
   But temperatures remained mild east of the cold air mass, and
Mansfield, Ohio, had a record 56 degrees, while Green Bay, Wis.,
tied its record of 43.
   Strong, gusty wind also ushered cold air into the Southwest.
   Heavy snow fell across Wyoming late Monday and early Tuesday,
including 15 inches at Big Horn, 11 inches at Rawlins, and 10
inches at Casper and Dayton.
   Heavy snow also fell across parts of western South Dakota, with
up to 9 inches reported in the Black Hills area.
   Snow advisories were posted for parts of Utah and Colorado.
   Snow also fell across parts of the Northwest, with snow reported
at elevations near sea level as far south as northern California,
where snow was reported at Arcata and Redding during the morning.
Newport, on the central coast of Oregon, got 2 inches of snow
overnight.
   Redding tied its record low for the date of 26 degrees.
   Snow was expected in northern Arizona by Wednesday and a winter
storm watch was issued for Wednesday at higher elevations.
   Strong southerly winds prevailed ahead of the arctic cold front
from the southern Plains and the lower Mississippi Valley to the
Northeast.
   Winds gusted to 54 mph during the morning at Burlington, Vt.,
and to 52 mph at Erie, Pa.
   Strong westerly winds blew through the high mountain passes of
extreme southwestern Texas. Guadalupe Pass reported winds at 56 mph
during the afternoon, with gusts to 69 mph.
   Wind warnings and advisories also were posted for parts of
Idaho, Nevada and Southern California
   Elsewhere, light snow fell ahead of a warm front over parts of
northern New England and upstate New York.
   Tuesday's low for the Lower 48 states was 14 degrees below zero
at Caribou, Maine.

   Short skirts, skittish decolletes and beautiful
fabrics gave a modern update to Celine styles for next winter in a
Tuesday show.
   If you thought Celine meant the carriage trade, specializing in
beautiful handbags and moccasins, you're right. But the house aims
to stay in the money with the rich country-club set since its
acquisition by the Agache group, run by Bernard Arnault, whose
stable also includes Dior and Christian Lacroix.
   ``We're still a classic house but with new flair in styles that
really go out on the street or to parties,'' said Celine's
president, Nan Legeai.
   Dressed in a siren-red suit with panther-spotted blouse, Legeai
said she was thrilled with the peppy new-look clothes, designed by
Peggy Huynh-Kinh.
   ``We also planned the event as a special one,'' she said of the
show that came before all the other ready-to-wear houses, which
plan to present their winter styles during the ready-to-wear week
next March.
   Models paraded Celine's fashions by tables in the covered
flowered garden at the Ritz Hotel. Many found the clothes
beautiful, if not overly trendy _ outfits that look very much at
home at the Ritz.
   From the lush cable-knit ivory or beige cashmere and suede pants
outfits to a smashing evening suit of ruby satin with slashed black
lapels over a transparent tulle blouse, the clothes were sexy but
very ``BCBG.''
   The acronym stands for ``bon chic, bon genre,'' meaning French
upper-middle class, a couple of notches above preppy or yuppie.
   ``I wanted to create practical ensembles for daytime, more
romantic styles for late day,'' said Ms. Huynh-Kinh, who designed
luxury ready-to-wear for Gres and Balmain before coming to Celine a
couple years ago.
   Celine was founded by Richard Vipiana and his wife in 1946, with
a line of leather goods, including the signature mocassins with
metal bits.
   The house was taken over by Aarnault's Financiere Agache
consortium in 1987.
   Celine's luxury ready-to-wear operation looks attractively
viable, with prices in the $1,000 range for a suit, less for a
draped velvet cocktail dress. And faithful clients will find fun
new items to tempt them in the superb and colorful argyle patterns
on suede handbags, belts and shoes.

<HEAD>United Nations Announces Withdrawal Plans from Namibia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With Namibia's independence set for
March 21, the United Nations announced plans Tuesday to withdraw
its more than 6,000 personnel from its largest and most expensive
peacekeeping operation.
   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard also said U.N. Secretary General
Javier Perez de Cuellar likely would attend the ceremonies marking
Namibia's independence after 75 years of South African rule.
   The South-West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), which will
form the first government, has said it will invite both South
African President F.W. de Klerk and recently released black leader
Nelson Mandela to attend.
   Eckhard said 4,000 troops will start pulling out immediately
after independence and all are expected to depart by April 8. Most
of the civilian staff and the police monitors should be gone by the
end of March or early April, Eckhard added.
   The operation has cost more than $400 million.
   Shortly after U.N. personnel began arriving last March, their
mission appeared in jeopardy when fighting broke out in April
between SWAPO guerrillas and the South African-led security forces.
   However, the fighting was stopped after three weeks and the
transition to independence has proceeded remarkably smoothly.
Elections, universally regarded as free and fair, were held in
November and seven parties captured seats in the 72-member
Constituent Assembly.
   SWAPO, which waged a 23-year bush war against South African, won
41 seats and its long-time leader Sam Nujoma is expected to be
named the first president.
   There have been sporadic instances of violence but no sustained
conflicts since the fighting in April last year.

   Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher and
Korea's trade minister signed an agreement Tuesday to create a
joint committee on commercial cooperation designed to expand trade
and reduce friction.
   The committee will develop opportunities for cooperation in
trade and investment, exchange information on mutually beneficial

   ``Our ability to address areas of potential cooperation will
lead not only to expanded trade, but reduced friction,'' Mosbacher
said after the signing with Korean Minister of Trade and Industry
Han Seung-Soo.
   ``South Korea's announcement yesterday of a $100 million award

   ``It's another brick in the strong foundation that exists for

<HEAD>White House Scuttles USIA Chief's Firing of VOA Director</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the U.S. Information Agency tried
to fire the director of the Voice of America last week, but the
White House said VOA's Richard Carlson still enjoyed President
Bush's confidence, officials said Tuesday.
   One government source close to the situation, speaking only on
condition of anonymity, described a confrontation between USIA
Director Bruce Gelb and Carlson over a decision last month to
eliminate six of VOA's 43 language services in an effort to save $3
million.
   White House personnel director Chase Untermeyer, while declining
to go into the question of any dispute between Gelb and Carlson,
said Tuesday that he had met in recent days with the two _ both
presidential appointees whose nominations had been approved by the
Senate.
   Gelb is a personal friend of Bush and a campaign fund raiser,
and Untermeyer said Carlson was held over from the Reagan
administration, ``proof that he has our support.''
   While declining to discuss what he had told the two men,
Untermeyer did say that now ``all is calm at USIA.''
   Fifty-seven people would lose their jobs if the Uzbek, Swahili,
Lao, Slovenian, Greek and Turkish services go off the air as
announced this spring and summer.
   The cuts were approved by Gelb, spokesman Frank Johnson said,
before Carlson announced the decision to employees two weeks ago.
Gelb ``approved the plan, but he wasn't comfortable with it,''
Johnson said.
   The USIA director was out of town when Carlson met with the VOA
employees, Johnson said. When Gelb returned and read news accounts
of the decision, he was extremely upset, said one participant at a
meeting of senior agency officials convened by Gelb.
   The USIA director ``claimed he knew nothing about it (the
decision). He was almost hysterical. He claimed we tricked him,''
said the source.
   Johnson, Gelb's spokesman, said the USIA director proposed that
funds be transferred from VOA's construction account to keep the
six services operating in what Johnson called ``one last attempt to
solve the problem.''
   Carlson and Gelb's senior aides objected, saying that the
construction budget was already squeezed and that any transfer of
funds could jeopardize transmitter projects around the world, said
the source.
   Carlson also said that transferring funds from one account to
another would require the approval of Congress, which had rejected
such a solution in preliminary discussions of VOA's budgetary
dilemma, the source said.
   But Gelb pressed his solution, berated Carlson for failing to
support him and told the VOA chief last Thursday that he was fired,
the source said.
   Gelb also told aides to cancel Carlson's Sunday departure for
Israel and talks with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir about a
$300 million transmitter the VOA wants to build in Israel to
improve its transmissions to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
   At that point, the White House weighed in.
   One source said that ``it was agreed they would try to work out
their differences.'' Johnson said simply that Gelb and Carlson
``enjoy a professional and worklike relationship.'' VOA spokeswoman
Beth Knisely said Carlson ``has not resigned and he has not been
fired.''
   On Tuesday, shortly before he left for Israel, Carlson met with
VOA employees to deny rumors that he'd been fired and, said one
participant, to tell them the White House was pleased with the job
VOA was doing.
   As for the announced cutbacks, VOA officials are now exploring
whether Congress will approve the transfer of funds to keep the six
foreign language services operating.

   Nelson Mandela's support for
guerrilla violence has ``not been helpful,'' but white leaders
agree with the need for black voting rights, a government minister
said Tuesday.
   Gerrit Viljoen, the constitutional development minister, said
Mandela's organization, the African National Congress, appears
confused over how to respond to the reforms of President F.W. de
Klerk.
   Mandela, the country's best known black leader, was freed Sunday
after more than 27 years in prison. He has said negotiations with
the white government could begin soon, but he still supports the
ANC sabotage campaign he helped launch in 1961.
   Viljoen, whose job is to negotiate a new constitution that will
enfranchise the 28 million blacks, said the government agrees with
Mandela on several major issues.
   ``The government accepts the principle of universal franchise
and an end to apartheid,'' he told a news conference, but
``Mandela's remarks on the armed struggle have not been helpful.''
   ``The government is not prepared to accede to the handing over
of power. If that is the goal of the armed struggle, then there is
no meaningful way ahead.''
   He said the government's ``power to maintain law and order is
quite considerable.''
   ``ANC policy ... dates back several decades'' and the
organization remains wedded to such ``failed'' policies as a
socialist-oriented economy, he said.
   On Feb. 2, de Klerk legalized the ANC and more than 60 other
opposition groups. The ANC says it still is considering a formal
response to the speech.
   ``It seems at the moment that there is some confusion and
contradiction in the responses of the ANC,'' Viljoen said, and
urged it to ``cooperate in the process of negotiations and not just
set new conditions.''
   De Klerk's government says it wants to bring blacks into the
national government within five years, but says a one-man, one-vote
democracy would result in black domination of the 5 million whites.

   Announcing the settlement, Clark said, ``It overcomes one of the
most difficult obstacles'' to a treaty NATO and the Warsaw Pact are
negotiating in Vienna on limits to conventional forces in Europe.
   Other key elements in the projected treaty would cover limits on
tanks and other non-nuclear weapons.
   However, only Monday, Secretary of State James A. Baker III
stressed in a speech to the conference that the United States and
the Soviet Union were in disagreement on limits for combat
aircraft. Without such agreement, a treaty would be more difficult
to reach.

<HEAD>Black Factional Violence Increases in Natal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DURBAN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black factional violence in Natal
province has increased and 50 people have been killed since Nelson
Mandela was freed from prison, according to estimates Tuesday by
police and monitoring groups.
   Also, people of Indian descent are being attacked more
frequently in the area around the port city of Durban, which has
the largest Indian population.
   Growing violence in an area that has suffered four years of
black factional fighting ``has been linked to the raised political
temperature created by Mr. Mandela's release and his statement that
the ... armed struggle would continue,'' said The Star of
Johannesburg, South Africa's largest daily.
   A police statement Tuesday afternoon said: ``Although the
situation was somewhat quieter today, a number of deaths were
reported from Natal and the eastern (Cape) province.''
   Police headquarters in Pretoria said an officer who tried to
stop three men from robbing a bus driver in a black township near
Pietermaritzburg, the capital of Natal, was shot in the back and
hacked to death.
   An officer was shot in the stomach and two black men were killed
when police fired at two clashing groups in Nxamalala, a Natal
township, police reported. They said houses were burned and three
black women were injured.
   Police said two black men were stabbed to death and burned when
houses were set ablaze in a factional fight in Kwanobuhle township
near Uitenhage in the eastern Cape province.
   Brig. Jac Buchner, police commissioner for the Zulu homeland in
Natal, said guns were used to kill 13 people in Mpumalanga township
Monday, the day after Mandela's release.
   He called it ``a worrying escalation'' in an area where
firebombs, knives and sharpened sticks are the usual weapons. More
than 2,500 people have been killed in the factional violence since
1986.
   Most of the Natal fighting was between supporters of the African
National Congress and members of the Inkatha political organization
of Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the Zulu chief minister, but criminal
elements were taking advantage of the chaos, police reported.
   The newspaper Natal Witness reported concern about increasing
anti-Indian sentiment in the townships around Durban.
   Black crowds have attacked Indians four times in a week, two
Indian men were stabbed to death in Durban on Sunday and other
blacks rescued Indians from a mob, it reported.
   Black marchers celebrating Mandela's release Sunday burned three
Indian stores and a gas station, witnesses said Tuesday. They said
police had fired on the marchers.
   Thulebana Phewa, 16, limping from police buckshot wounds, said
the attacks by 3,000 blacks on Indian stores were not racial. He
said people were angered when officers from a nearby police station
opened fire on a peaceful crowd in a squatter area outside Durban
called Amahula.
   Phewa said looters took 12 cows from the I.J. Hafferjee general
store and slaughtered two before police fired shotguns and
recovered the remaining cattle.
   Groups monitoring the unrest said a pamphlet was distributed in
black townships saying Indians controlled the Congress of South
African Trade Unions and had called strikes so black people would
lose their jobs.
   The pamphlet urged Zulus to unite against the labor federation,
which is affiliated with Mandela's African National Congress.
   Buthelezi said Tuesday the pamphlets had nothing to do with his
organization or government.
   ``I totally condemn any racist behavior and utterances directed
against the Indian community and ask that a halt be called to all
rumor mongering ... that may result in death and destruction,'' he
said in a statement distributed by the independent South African
Press Association.

<TEXT>
   The presidents of Peru and Bolivia say they
will ask the United States at the drug summit Thursday for money to
help farmers switch from coca, the raw material of cocaine, to
growing other crops.
   Presidents Alan Garcia of Peru, Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia and
Virgilio Barco of Colombia are to meet President Bush in Cartagena,
Colombia, on Thursday to discuss the drug-trafficking problem.
   Garcia said Tuesday he will request help for Peruvian farmers to
stop growing coca and produce coffee, cocoa or other crops.
   Paz Zamora told a meeting of farmers Monday north of La Paz, the
capital of Bolivia: ``We are not going to allow the peasants of
Bolivia to become poorer after substituting'' other crops for coca.
   Andina, the Peruvian government news agency, quoted Garcia on
Tuesday as saying peasants of the Huallaga Valley, a major
coca-growing region, were willing to switch crops if they were
assured transportation for what they produced and an international
market for it.
   With those conditions, ``In a year or two we'll switch over all
the land now under coca, but ... massive economic resources are
needed,'' Garcia was quoted as saying.
   He said Peru exports about $3 billion worth of fish meal, oil,
coffee, silver and other products, plus about $750 million to $1
billion worth of coca and cocaine paste.
   Coca ``is enormously important to our economy,'' the agency
quoted him as saying.
   The Bolivian president, Paz Zamora, told the farmers he would
pursue a policy of eradicating coca plantations in exchange for
economic and social development programs.
   He said Barco and Garcia agree with that position and he was
confident Bush also will agree.
   About 1,500 farmers attended the meeting Monday at Coroico, in a
coca-producing area about 60 miles north of La Paz.
   Substituting other crops for coca is the centerpiece of Bolivian
policy against drug trafficking but it has made little progress.
   Bolivia adopted an ambitious plan in 1988 to eradicate coca
cultivation in seven years, but as of Jan. 31 only 7,750 acres had
been withdrawn from coca cultivation, about 5 percent of the
officially recognized 150,250 acres devoted to coca. Plans had
called for the elimination of 12,500 acres in 1989 alone.
   Part of the plan to substitute other crops for coca was the
payment of $2,000 to peasants for every hectare (2.5 acres) of coca
planting eliminated voluntarily. Peasants also demanded better
prices for the new crops, guaranteed markets and better roads and
transportation.
   On Monday, Paz Zamora said coca production ``allows us to keep
our balance of payments even, and for this reason we should study
carefully the problem of substituting other crops.''
   In eight to 10 years, when the substitution program has been
completed, farmers should have incomes at least equivalent to what
they now make from coca, he said.

<HEAD>Romanian Council Says It Will Serve as Quasi-Parliament</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Romania's new, ruling Council of
National Unity endorsed Ion Iliescu as interim president on Tuesday
and said it would serve as a quasi-parliament.
   Despite its powers, including the right to initiate legislation,
Iliescu stressed the council is not quite a parliament.
   ``We were never elected and should try to concentrate as much as
possible on our main task of paving the way for elections,'' he
said. ``In the future parliament of Romania, everyone will have the
right of legislative initiative.''
   The second meeting of the 253-member council was held in a
markedly improved atmosphere over its inaugural session Friday,
when opposition parties accused Iliescu of packing the hall with
rowdy supporters of his National Salvation Front.
   ``We have shown constructive debate and even consensus are
possible,'' Iliescu said after the meeting. ``We now have chances
... to assure the continuation of life in this country until the
elections.''
   Radu Campeanu, head of the influential National Liberal Party,
lauded the achievement of an ``equilibrium, albeit fragile.'' He
had criticized the Front on Monday and accused it of packing the
council.
   Also Tuesday, military officers demonstrated to demand that the
ministers of defense and interior resign as part of an overall
purge of military officials who backed Communist dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu in December's revolution.
   The Defense Ministry dismissed the demands Tuesday night as
ignorant and ``an affront'' to military values.
   Nearly 300 uniformed officers protested silently in pouring rain
outside government headquarters in Victory Square while 49
representatives waited inside to see Iliescu and present a list of
demands.
   It was the military's first serious challenge to the government,
which consolidated power only after the army decided to back the
popular uprising against Ceausescu, who was deposed and later
executed.
   Iliescu was president of the 11-member National Salvation Front
council that ruled until the Council of National Unity took over
Friday. On Tuesday he was confirmed as president of the new council.
   At one point during the debate, Iliescu asked: ``Is anyone
opposed to my continuing as president?''
   A near-unanimous chorus of ``No!'' was his answer.
   Elected as Vice Presidents were Campeanu, Ion Minzatu of the
Republican Party, independents Cazimir Ionescu and Ion Caramitru,
and Karol Kiraly, representing minorities.
   The council decided to hold regular biweekly meetings on Fridays
and other meetings ``as circumstances dictate;'' two-thirds of the
membership constitutes a quorum; decisions will be made by simple
majority in either open or secret ballot, and attendance will be
mandatory for government members.
   Tuesday's council meeting was open to reporters and broadcast on
TV.
   The council elected a 21-member Executive Bureau to coordinate
activities _ 10 representatives of political parties, 10
independent Council members, plus Iliescu.
   One major point of contention within the Council will likely be
opposition demands that the elections be postponed until at least
September.
   More than 35 parties are expected to compete in Romania's first
multiparty elections since World War II, now set for May 20.
   The council also set up 16 commissions to deal with specific
issues, including one to investigate ``abuses'' committed under
Ceausescu's leadership and another on constitutional and human
rights.
   The transport minister late Tuesday resolved merchant seamen's
complaints over pay and food that led to strikes that closed
Romania's main port of Constanza on the Black Sea and several
smaller ports Monday and Tuesday, idling dozens of ships.
   ``Our conditions of working and living have made us the
laughingstock of the world. We have become the paupers of the
sea,'' said Petricia Munteanu, president of the Union of Merchant
Seamen.

<HEAD>Opposition Spokesman Accuses Communists Of Stalling Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A spokesman for Bulgaria's opposition
alliance accused the Communist Party on Tuesday of trying to hinder
progress in negotiations, the official Bulgarian news agency BTA
reported.
   Georgi Spassov of the Union of Democratic Forces, appearing on
national television, also repeated its demands that party cells in
factories and other places of work be abolished before free
elections scheduled for May, the agency said.
   At the weekly negotiating session Monday, the opposition said it
would not continue talks with the Communists until that issue was
resolved.
   The Union of Democratic Forces has been negotiating for more
power sharing, but has refused Communist appeals to join the
government because the party still dominates Parliament.
   Last week the Agrarian Party, once a docile ally of the
Communists, said it was abandoning its subservient role and no
longer would participate in the government, which left Premier
Andrei Lukanov no alternative to forming an all-Communist Cabinet.
   BTA quoted Spassov of comparing the national negotiations to ``a
boat with oars on one side only that's ... going round and round in
a vicious circle.''
   He accused the Communists of ``torpedoing'' the talks by
delaying agreement on several questions.
   Spassov claimed the Communists were ``in complete isolation,''
BTA reported.
   That appeared to be a reference to the Agrarian Party and
reformists who split from the Communist Party and formed the
Alternative Socialist Party on Sunday.
   Although neither has joined the opposition, both parties
supported the demands the alliance made at Monday's talks.
   Communist Party structures were like ``cancerous growths,''
Spassov said, and should be demolished because they were ``a means
for the nomenclatura (bureaucracy) to keep in subjection and
exploit all working people, Communists included.''
   He repeated the threat to withdraw from the talks.
   In apparent response, Georgi Pirinski, head of the Communist
delegation to the talks, said in a separate television statement
any ``dictatorial approach'' was unacceptable and served only to
question the work of the negotiations.
   One opposition demand has been for greater access to the media,
especially television and radio, to carry its platforms to the
entire country. They have been allowed to start a newspaper, which
is called Democracy and began publishing Monday.
   State television and other official media are reporting on the
oppposition more openly, but it has been a slow process.
   BTA reported that, on Tuesday, the Communist Party daily
Rabotnichesko Delo appeared for the first time without the party
motto ``Workers of the World Unite.''
   Stefan Prodev, the new, reform-minded editor in chief, said in
an editorial it must ``turn from a paper of one large party into a
paper of the nation.''

   A crowd stormed Communist Party headquarters in
the Tadzhikistan capital of Dushanbe Tuesday in ethnic rioting that
has killed at least 37 people and injured 108, news reports said.
   Armenians fled the city by the hundreds to escape the violence,
which began Monday. The situation worsened Tuesday, with at least
200 new attacks and other incidents despite a curfew and state of
emergency, late-night television news said.
   Soldiers in tanks and armored personnel carriers were reportedly
in control of the central Asian city 1,600 miles from Moscow, but
violence was spreading to the suburbs, said Anatoly Larenok, a
correspondent for the national newspaper Vozdushny Transport.
   ``There are tanks guarding key buildings in the center of the
city,'' he said.
   People began to flock into Dushanbe, a city with about 400,000
residents, early Tuesday to gather in front of Communist Party
headquarters. But officials failed to persuade them to disperse and
the crowd attacked the building, the television report said.
   Later, local authorities appealed to the population on
Tadzhikistan television to repel the ``hooligans.'' They also said
local forces were insufficient to control the situation and urged
the national leadership to help them.
   Television showed footage of clashes between rioters and police,
smashed vehicles and shattered storefronts. In one scene, a smiling
old man stepped out of a broken store window with his arms full of
cartons of milk.
   Violence broke out in Dushanbe on Monday after rumors spread
that thousands of Armenian refugees _ already fleeing ethnic
clashes with Azerbaijanis in the Caucasus _ were being given
preference for scarce new housing.
   There is a chronic housing shortage in Dushanbe for Tadzhik
families, which traditionally are large.
   Larenok said at least 300 Armenians had fled the city aboard
special flights to Yerevan, the Armenian capital, and many others
had left on regular flights.
   About 30 people were arrested for taking part in the violence,
the television said.
   Ethnic tensions also were reported high in Frunze, capital of
the neighboring republic of Kirgizia on the border with China,
following rumors that Armenian refugees were to receive apartments
in the city, the Komsomolskaya Pravda said. No violence was
reported there.
   Zaniddin Nasreddinov, an editor at the Tajiktass news agency,
reported another rally in the center of Dushanbe Tuesday morning,
but said there was no violence. Communist Party leaders spoke to
the crowd and assured them that all Armenian refugees had left the
city, he said.
   The demonstrators elected a committee of 12 to represent the
public in negotiations with authorities on issues such as the
current ethnic strife, housing and unemployment, Nasreddinov said.
   Interfax, a publication of official Radio Moscow, said the crowd
demanded the deportation of all Armenians from Tadzhikistan, the
closure of an ecologically dangerous aluminum plant, the return to
the republic of all proceeds from cotton production, and the
resignations of the Communist Party and government leadership.
   The official Tass news agency, contradicting the TV report of
continuing attacks, said Dushanbe was calm Tuesday but ``still very
tense.''
   An official with the Interior Ministry who declined to give his
name said the situation remained ``serious'' Tuesday night.
   A state of emergency was declared Monday and a 10 p.m.-6 a.m.
curfew was imposed, Tass said. The curfew remained in effect
Tuesday night.
   Tass said precise casualty figures were unavailable, but
preliminary reports showed that at least seven people had died in
the rioting and 108 were injured when young Tadzhiks stormed the
Communist Party headquarters and went on a rampage in the city.
   The news agency said a small crowd that had gathered in front of
the building Monday morning swelled to a rally of at least 4,000
later in the day.
   Communist Party First Secretary Kakhar Makhkamov and other
members of the government told the crowd that only about 40
refugees were in Dushanbe, and they were living with relatives,
Tass said.
   ``No one believed them, and several members from the rally
attempted to enter the building,'' Tass said. ``Interior Ministry
troops blocked entrances to the building and soldiers fired into
the air, but this did not stop the extremists.''
   Shots were fired at the troops from the crowd and stones were
thrown at them, Tass said. Rampaging youths broke the ground floor
windows and set fire to the building, it said.
   Larenok reported that the rioters then attacked apartments
belonging to Armenians across the city. ``A jewelry store, shops, a
railway station and several kiosks were broken into and smashed,''
he said in a telephone interview.
   ``The rampage continued in the street. Several trolleybuses and
cars were set on fire,'' Larenok said. ``Passersby, including women
and children, were attacked and beaten.''
   More than 200 people have been killed in the southern Caucasus
republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan since Jan. 13. President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev sent thousands of soldiers into the area to
end a nationalist revolt in the Azerbaijani capital of Baku and end
attacks on Armenians, many of whom have been evacuated from
Azerbaijan.
   Until Monday, there had been no reports that the trouble had
spread to the predominantly Moslem republics of Soviet Central Asia
such as Tadzhikistan.
   Families in Tadzhikistan, a small mountainous republic bordering
China and Afghanistan, traditionally are large. In addition to the
housing shortage, some of the mainly Moslem Tadzhiks also remain
homeless after an earthquake in the republic in January 1989 that
killed scores of people.

<HEAD>25 People Die in Scattered Guerrilla Violence in Peru</HEAD>

   Scattered clashes and assassinations by
leftist guerrillas have left 25 people dead across the country in
the past three days, authorities said Tuesday.
   Also Tuesday, the Interior Ministry announced the capture of
four Shining Path rebels who were accused of producing counterfeit
tickets to soccer matches and bullfights and selling them for money
for the group's armed insurgency. Officials said the illegal
operation went on for five years.
   In the bloodiest incident in three days, police said 100 Shining
Path guerrillas with automatic weapons attacked the mountain
village of Sol Naciente Sunday night, and captured and killed eight
peasants.
   The rebels also wounded nine others who tried to flee, police
said.
   Police said the attack probably was in response to the village's
recent formation of a civil defense group intended to repel
guerrilla incursions. The military has organized dozens of the
groups in isolated villages to fight the rebels, but many are armed
only with homemade shotguns, lances and machetes.
   Witnesses to Sunday's attack said villagers tried to hold off
the rebels with two shotguns, then had to flee when they used up
their ammunition.
   Sol Naciente is 245 miles southeast of Lima in a remote area of
the Andes. Police said some of the wounded were being hospitalized
in Ayacucho.
   Another report said members of a civil defense group in the
village of Andamarca, 165 miles east of Lima, ambushed 15
guerrillas Sunday night and killed seven.
   Police said a gun battle Monday between Shining Path rebels and
a police patrol near San Martin de Pangoa, 175 miles east of Lima
in the jungle, left five guerrillas dead and one policeman wounded.
   Also Monday, police said, guerrillas fatally shot two policemen
in Piura, two others in Huacho, and one in Chiclayo.
   Huacho and Chiclayo are on the Pacific coast northwest of Lima,
and Piura is in the northern coastal desert.
   The Interior Ministry said police Tuesday captured four men with
printing equipment and thousands of counterfeit tickets to soccer
games at the national stadium and bullfights at Lima's historic
Acho bull ring.
   They identified the four as working for the Shining Path and
said the tickets were sold to raise money for guerrilla operations.
   Police said the four also produced thousands of falsified
identification cards for providing aliases to Shining Path members
to escape police detection.
   The Mao-inspired Shining Path launched its armed insurgency in
1980 near Ayacucho, 235 miles southeast of Lima in the Andean
highlands. The group now operates through much of the highlands and
the coca-producing jungles of the northeast, where drug traffickers
pay them to provide protection from police, authorities say.
   The government says more than 17,500 people have died in the
decade of violence, including police, soldiers, rebels, government
officials and civilians.

   Labor Party leader Shimon Peres on Tuesday
demanded a quick Cabinet vote on a Palestinian-approved compromise
to launch peace talks, and senior party officials said Labor should
pull out of the government if the proposal is rejected.
   ``We will certainly act so that the Cabinet will make an
unequivocal decision regarding the makeup of the Palestinian
delegation. There is no point in any delay or avoidance tactics,''
the leader of the center-left party told Israel army radio.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir moved to reconcile with
hard-liners in his right-wing Likud bloc who want to block the
compromise, which outlines the makeup of a Palestinian delegation
to peace talks with Israel in Cairo.
   The compromise plan has U.S. backing.
   A Likud meeting broke up in confusion Monday after the hawks
tried to force a vote on specific compromise proposals, while
Shamir insisted on a general show of support for his peace
initiative calling for elections in the occupied lands.
   Peres, who has accused Shamir of endangering peace efforts
through stalling tactics, suggested that the chaos in Likud
heightened the need for a quick decision.
   He did not say when he would seek a vote on the compromise plan,
or whether a Likud rejection would prompt him to break up the
Labor-Likud coalition.
   The so-called Forum of Four _ comprised of Shamir, Peres,
Likud's Foreign Minister Moshe Arens and Labor's Defense Minister
Yitzhak Rabin _ is scheduled to meet Wednesday. The next regularly
scheduled Cabinet session is on Sunday.
   Haim Ramon, the chief Labor parliamentarian, demanded on Israel
TV that Labor quit the government if the Cabinet rejects the
compromise plan.
   ``If Shamir says no, and blocks this opening, there is proof
that there is no point to continue the peace process with the prime
minister,'' he said.
   The compromise plan says the 10-member Palestinian delegation
should include two Arabs deported by Israel from the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip, and at least one resident of Israeli-annexed
Arab east Jerusalem who also has an address in the occupied lands.
   Such a delegation would meet Palestinian demands for diaspora
representation, while technically complying with Israel's
insistence that it will only negotiate with residents of the
occupied territories.
   Likud hard-liners, including Trade Minister Ariel Sharon and
Housing Minister David Levy, say the compromise allows the PLO to
enter negotiations through the back door and cast doubts on
Israel's sovereignty over Jerusalem.
   In a speech before the Likud Central Committee on Monday, Shamir
ruled out participation of east Jerusalem Arabs but did not address
the issue of deportees, suggesting he was ready to compromise.
   On Tuesday, Likud activists, including Levy, were trying to
persuade Sharon to withdraw his letter of resignation, which he
read at the opening of the Likud meeting.
   Sharon said on Israel radio he had no plans to retract the
letter, but left a door open to compromise. He said that if he had
not quit on principle, ``I would prefer certainly to stay in the
government.''
   By law, the resignation does not take effect until 48 hours
after the premier receives the letter.
   Also Tuesday, Arab reporters said Israeli border police entered
a Bethlehem high school near Manger Square and beat two dozen
students with truncheons, metal bars and rifle butts.
   The army said a border police patrol entered the Bethlehem High
School for Boys Tuesday after students threw stones at them, but
that all injuries occurred when the youths escaped over a terrace.
   The Arab reports did not say what provoked the incident.
   Hospital officials in Bethlehem said they treated 20 students
and that at least five of them suffered serious head injuries.
   The body of Abdu Salam Hamoud, 24, was found in a cave near the
West Bank village of Beituniya, where he lived, and Arab reports
said he was suspected of collaborting with Israeli authorities.
   The army confirmed the death and said police were investigating.
   Hamoud's death would bring to 182 the number of Palestinians
killed by fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of collaborating with
Israel's security service.
   At least 656 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers
or civilians in the 26-month-old revolt against Israeli rule in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Forty-three Israelis have also
died in the violence.

<HEAD>President Says Greater Development Needed to Combat Coca Leaf
Farming</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Jaime Paz Zamora said Tuesday
on the eve of his departure for the drug summit in Colombia that
greater economic development is the key to stopping coca leaf
farming.
   He also said consuming nations must do more to combat drug use.
   ``Coca reduction in exchange for development _ that is our
premise,'' Paz Zamora told foreign reporters. ``We are proposing
investments in the Bolivian economy. It is not just a question of
substituting one hectare of coca for oranges or coffee but the
development of the country because coca is an integral part of the
economy.''
   Now, the government says, cocaine brings in $500 million to $600
million a year in illegal export earnings. The country's legal
export earnings for 1989 were $600 million dollars.
   Paz Zamora praised President Bush ``because he is showing unlike
any other U.S. president that the cocaine problem is a global one.''
   Bolivia's president called on the establishment of an emergency
fund to handle the problem of unemployment and poverty that would
be created as coca plants are eradicated.
   He said, however, that he was not going to the drug summit in
Cartagena, Colombia, to ask for specific amounts of U.S. aid but to
present Bolivia's views.
   ``We do not want subsidies for alternative products since that
is a short- term solution,'' Paz Zamora said. ``We rather require
help in private and public investment and export policies that
would strengthen our economy. We have to compete with alternative
crops.''
   Bolivia, an impoverished country of 6.9 million in the heart of
South America, produces an estimated one-third of the coca leaf
that is processed into cocaine paste and cocaine.
   Bolivia's coca leaf eradication program began to take off in
December and January when farmers destroyed 3,127 acres of coca
plants.
   Farmers destroyed fewer than 7,410 acres in 1989, far short of
the 12,350 goal under an agreement with the U.S. government that
promised aid in return for meeting the eradication quota.
   The United States was supposed to cut off $12 million in
economic aid but has decided not to because of the eradication
efforts of the past two months, the U.S. Embassy in La Paz said.
   At least 250,000 farmers depend on coca leaf cultivation and
cocaine production for their livelihood, U.S. Embassy figures
indicate. But tens of thousands of coca leaf farmers have been
leaving the tropical jungles in interior Bolivia in recent weeks
because the price of coca has plummeted below the cost of
production.
   The drop in coca leaf prices is attributed to the Colombian drug
crackdown and increased anti-drug activities in Bolivia's
drug-producing jungles.
   Bolivian police and U.S. drug agents said Tuesday that two major
cocaine processing labs had been destroyed and 8,800 pounds of
cocaine paste confiscated the past several days.
   The labs, found the past four days, were hidden in tropical
forests in the north, where most of the coca leaf is processed into
cocaine paste and cocaine. They are the biggest labs and the
largest quantity of cocaine paste ever found in the region, the
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration said.
   ``We are now aiming at big-time traffickers and leaving farmers
alone,'' said Don Ferrarone, the DEA station chief for Bolivia.
   He said the labs were in full operation and were capable of
producing 1,100 to 13,000 pounds of cocaine base a day.

   The four Allied powers that defeated Nazi
Germany in World War II have maintained their rights as victors,
and 45 years later still have the final say on the reunification of
the divided nation.
   The disclosure in Ottawa that the United States, Soviet Union,
Britain and France had agreed to a two-stage plan for reunification
provides the international framework to close the long final
chapter of the war.
   A peace treaty has never been signed between the four powers and
Germany, even though all four ended their state of war with the
country during the 1950s.
   Differences between the Western powers and the Soviet Union over
Germany led to some of the tensest episodes of the post-war era,
such as the Western airlift in 1948-49 that broke the Soviet
attempt to isolate West Berlin.
   In 1961, East Germany built the Berlin Wall, which only began to
be dismantled last year, around West Berlin to stop the flow of
East Germans to the West. That exodus was threatening to deprive
the Communist state of some of its most skilled workers.
   At the end of World War II, Britain, the Soviet Union and the
United States agreed pending a peace settlement that some former
German territories in the east would be taken over by Poland and
the Soviet Union. Many Germans living there fled to the West.
   East and West Germany joined in the 35-nation Helsinki accords
of 1975 that specified European borders could be changed only
peacefully, and West Germany has signed separate treaties with the
Soviet Union and Poland that addressed the border issues.
   But not all German political parties have renounced claims to
the eastern territories, and any peace agreement would be expected
to put the issue to rest.
   The zones occupied by the victors after the war became the
modern states of East and West Germany _ the Germany Democratic
Republic in the eastern, Soviet zone and the Federal Republic of
Germany in the western zones.
   Over the years the four powers have forsaken most of their
occupying rights in East and West Germany, but a number of
anomalies remain, and the victors continue to oversee Berlin.
   Berlin, deep inside East Germany, is divided into four sectors,
each controlled by one of the powers. The British, French and U.S.
sectors make up West Berlin and the Soviet sector is East Berlin,
which East Germany claims as its capital.
   Armed forces of the four powers retain and exercise their rights
to patrol in the other sectors. The Western powers refuse to
recognize East German authority in East Berlin and officially
insist on resolving any disputes with Soviet officers.
   The four powers' military units also have rights to patrol in
East and West Germany.
   The Western powers require East and West Germany to run ``troop
trains'' to ferry any of their military between West Germany and
Berlin. East Germany must allow access through three corridors
across its territory to Berlin.
   The military forces of Britain, France and the United States
remain concentrated in the zones once occupied by the victors, now
allied with West Germany through the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   The Western powers also have maintained exclusive rights to fly
commercial planes into Berlin from the West, although West Germany
has recently obtained some rights for joint flights.
   Reluctance of the Western powers to recognize the East German
state created under the auspices of the Soviets was one of the
obstacles to German membership in the United Nations. East and West
Germany didn't join the United Nations until 1973.
   One of the last joint enterprises of the four powers was
imprisoning Rudolf Hess, a deputy to Hitler, whom they took turns
guarding in Spandau prison in Berlin until he died in 1987 at age
93.

   The Security Council's five permanent
members said Cambodia's warring factions must withdraw to separate
areas as a prelude to peace, but talks ended Tuesday without
agreement on disarming the groups.
   Representatives of the United States, the Soviet Union, France,
China and Britain focused their discussions on proposals to get all
parties in the civil war to lay down their arms and sought to
define the shape of an interim government to rule until elections.
   However, diplomats said the three days of talks stalled over
proposals to dismantle the Communist government of Premier Hun Sen
and its army, which are supported by Vietnam.
   U.N. diplomatic sources speaking on condition of anonymity said
the Soviet Union, allied with Vietnam, opposed moves led by China
to urge disarming the Cambodian military and three guerrilla
factions.
   Beijing supports the Khmer Rouge and Washington provides backing
for the two non-Communist factions.
   The Security Council members issued a statement saying ``the
regrouping and cantonment of the armed forces of the factions into
designated areas'' is essential to the peace process. It did not
elaborate.
   The statement also said the Council members discussed possible
U.N. administration of Cambodia and how to structure the interim
government.
   ``They look forward to making further progress on this key issue
in subsequent discussions,'' the statement said.
   The five countries agreed to resume consultations in Paris
during the first half of March following a conference on Cambodia
set for Feb. 26-28 in Indonesia.
   The full 15-member Security Council would have to approve a
major U.N. role in Cambodia peace efforts.
   The Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia from April 1975 to late 1978,
when Vietnam invaded to oust it. During the Khmer Rouge's reign,
nearly 1 million Cambodians died of starvation and disease or were
executed.
   Vietnam says the last of its troops left Cambodia last year.

   More young Americans today love
humor if it is gruesome, targets women or is low-key, according to
a psychologist who studied what made college students laugh.
   James Carroll, a psychology professor at Central Michigan
University, said Tuesday that students 25 years ago disapproved of
the gruesome humor that is now widely accepted.
   ``Gary Larson's cartoon `The Far Side,' which occasionally
portrays animals eating humans, is an example of gruesome humor, so
are Helen Keller jokes and dead baby jokes,'' Carroll said.
``College students 25 years ago did not endorse that kind of humor,
but it seems more acceptable today.''
   Mel Helitzer, a journalism professor who teaches a course in
humor at Ohio University in Athens, Ohio, said societal attitudes
have changed more than have individual tastes.
   ``It's more of a public acceptance,'' Helitzer said. ``Humor is
criticism and we tend to make jokes about things that bother us,
like Dan Quayle.''
   Carroll administered the Institute for Personality and Ability
Testing Humor Test of Personality to 79 college students in fall
1988. The original test was administered in 1963 to 200 students by
Raymond Cattell at the University of Illinois. Results of Carroll's
study were published in the December 1989 issue of Psychological
Reports.
   The test asks subjects to respond to 150 jokes and cartoons as
either funny or dull. He correlated the results with 12 dimensions
of humor and compared the findings to the 1963 results of the same
test.
   ``What we once called blue humor or hard core is being accepted
today,'' said Helitzer, who had not reviewed the study.
   Carroll said his study found college students of both sexes have
changed in their appreciation of humor. For instance, the 1963
study indicated that 40 percent to 45 percent of all students
appreciated humor directed at women. That figure rose to about 70
percent of all students in the 1988 study.
   ``It may be that the society is more open,'' Carroll said.
   His study also found that women are finding jokes about
themselves funny, and people like low-key, controlled humor like
that of comedians David Letterman and Arsenio Hall.

<HEAD>Red Cross Got $52.5 million for Quake Relief, Spending Half</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Red Cross received $52.5
million in donations designated for earthquake relief after the
Oct. 17 quake, but the group only plans to spend half that amount
on the disaster, a spokeswoman said.
   Mayor Art Agnos has criticized the disaster relielf organization
for failing to disclose donation and spending information, as well
as its spending plans.
   So far, the Red Cross has spent $12.1 million, according to
spokeswoman Barbara Lohman, who said the total emergency spending
will reach between $13 million and $16 million.
   An additional $10 million was allocated in December for
``extraordinary''' needs, she said, after elected officials and
community leaders appealed to the Red Cross for additional aid.
   An Agnos spokesman said the figures disclosed Monday confirm the
mayor's position.
   ``This seems to confirm what we've been saying, and even more,''
said spokesman Scott Shafer. ``That $52.5 million figure is just
for those who designated earthquake relief. A lot of people
probably just donated without specifying where it was to go so even
that figure is probably conservative.''
   Lohman defended the spending plans.
   ``We don't give service based on how much money has been
raised,'' she said. ``We give service based on needs.''
   Donors who earmark their checks for quake relief have no
guarantee that the money will be spent that way, she confirmed.
   A committee charged with allocating the special $10 million fund
has set a deadline for Friday for accepting spending proposals from
cities, counties and private groups, Lohman said. The group will
begin making decisions next month, she said, adding that more money
may be allocated if the needs are there.
   The northern California quake on Oct. 17 measured 7.1 on the
Richter scale, killing 67 people, injuring about 3,000 and causing
an estimated $7 billion in damage.

<TEXT>
   The four nations that defeated Nazi Germany in
World War II have maintained their rights as victors and legally
have the final say 45 years later on the reunification of the
divided nation.
   The disclosure in Ottawa that the United States, the Soviet
Union, Britain and France had agreed to a two-stage plan aimed at
reunifying Germany provides the international framework to close
the final chapter of the war.
   The four principal victors _ the United States, Britain, France
and the Soviet Union _ all ended their state of war with Germany
country during the 1950s. The three western powers made agreements
with West Germany, the Soviet Union with East Germany. Further
agreements followed in the 1970s.
   No peace treaty was ever signed, and it is not clear there will
be a formal treaty like the Versailles Treaty that ended World War
I.
   Germany was never supposed to be divided, and the allies agreed
to administer the country as a unit. But to avoid confusion, zones
of occupation were established for the country, and separately for
the capital, Berlin, even before the allied armies entered the
country from East and West.
   Despite pressure from British Prime Minister Winston Churchill
to hold what he had, the western commander, Gen. Dwight Eisenhower,
insisted on adhering to the occupation zones, even pulling back
U.S. troops that had driven much further to the East in many places.
   Differences arose almost before the shooting stopped. The Soviet
Union dismantled whole factories in its occupation zone, carting
them home over the objections of the western allies.
   The introduction of a new currency in the western zones over
Soviet objections in 1948 led the Soviets to stop all rail, road
and water access to Berlin, which lay 110 miles inside their
occupation zone.
   An airlift by the western powers that flew coal and food into
Berlin 'round the clock eventually led to the lifting of the
blockade, one of the most tense episodes of the Cold War.
   In 1961 East Germany built the Berlin Wall, that only began to
be removed last year, around West Berlin to stop the flow of East
Germans to West Berlin which was threatening to deprive the
communist state of some of its best-trained people.
   At the Potsdam Conference in July 1945, Britain, the Soviet
Union and the United States agreed that pending a peace settlement,
some former German territories in the east would be taken over by
Poland and the Soviet Union. Many Germans living there fled to the
West.
   East and West Germany joined in the 35-nation Helsinki accords
of 1975 that specified European borders could be changed only
peacefully, and West Germany has signed separate treaties with the
Soviet Union and Poland that addressed the border issues.
   But not all German political parties have renounced claims to
the eastern territories, and any peace agreement would be expected
to put the issue to rest.
   The zones occupied by the powers after the war became the modern
states of East and West Germany _ the Germany Democratic Republic
in the eastern, Soviet zone and the Federal Republic of Germany in
the three western zones.
   Over the years the four powers have forsaken most of their
occupying rights in East and West Germany, but a number of
anomalies remain, and the victors continue to be the legal
overseers of Berlin.
   The city is divided into four sectors, each controlled by one of
the powers. The British, French and U.S. sectors make up West
Berlin and the Soviet sector is East Berlin, which East Germany
claims as its capital.
   Armed forces of the four powers retain and exercise their rights
to patrol in the other sectors. The Western powers refuse to
recognize East German authority in East Berlin and officially
insist on resolving any disputes with Soviet officers.
   The four powers military units also have rights to patrol in
East and West Germany.
   The Western powers require East and West Germany to run ``troop
trains'' to ferry their military units between West Germany and
Berlin. East Germany must allow access through three corridors
across its territory to Berlin.
   The military forces of Britain, France and the United States
remain concentrated in the zones once occupied by the victors, now
allied with West Germany through the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   The Western powers also have maintained exclusive rights to fly
commercial planes into Berlin from the West, although West Germany
has recently obtained some rights for joint flights.
   Reluctance of the powers to recognize the state created under
the auspices of the other side was one of the obstacles to German
membership in the United Nations. East and West Germany didn't join
until 1973.
   One of the last joint enterprises of the four powers was
imprisoning Rudolf Hess, a deputy to Hitler until his mysterious
flight to Britain in 1941. They took turns guarding Hess in Spandau
prison in Berlin until he died in 1987 at 93.

   Drexel Burnham Lambert's announcement that it
was seeking bankruptcy court protection deepened the gloom for many
stock market traders, whose jobs already are at risk amid an
industrywide business recession.
   ``The atmosphere of the market is as bad as I've ever seen it,''
said Frederic J. Bostrom, who has spent 22 years as a New York
Stock Exchange floor trader, the last five with Minneapolis-based
brokerage Piper, Jaffray &amp; Hopwood Inc.
   Drexel brokers and clerks milled about on the exchange floor
Tuesday, openly looking for job prospects. Skittishness and gallows
humor prevailed among nearly all the traders as they elbowed past
each other or stepped outside for cigarettes.
   ``Did you hear _ Drexel's paying debts with Monopoly money,'' a
passing trader said to Bostrom.
   In a telephone interview after the close of trading, Bostrom
said he had received calls from large institutional clients of
Drexel, asking him if he knew of any openings for brokers. There
were none.
   ``If one out of 10 that are unemployed by Drexel Burnham find a
job, that's good given the state of the business these days,'' he
said.
   One floor specialist, who asked not to be identified, played
down the effects of Drexel's problems on the mood of the exchange,
noting that the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up nearly 5
points after initially falling when Drexel said it would default on
$100 million in loans.
   But others said the market's performance was no indicator of the
depth of personal fears on the trading floor.
   ``This stuff is very, very worrisome, as it bears on the whole
stock market community and the feeling that you ain't seen it all
yet,'' said Robert Seijas, a specialist with the firm Lasker, Stone
&amp; Stern. ``It's generally an atmosphere of malaise, of uncertainty
and depression.''
   The securities industry's business has slowed since the October
1987 stock market crash, resulting in thousands of layoffs as firms
attempt to cut costs.
   ``You've got an already depressed industry with people losing
their jobs, and then you superimpose this on top of it,'' said an
independent trader. ``There isn't a positive sign here right now.''
   Further deepening the gloom were fears that Drexel's troubles
would create a ripple effect among companies with business or
pending deals with Drexel.
   Those fears were fueled early in the day when exchange officials
temporarily stopped the execution of trades by Pforzheimer &amp; Co., a
company that uses Drexel's back office to complete its trades.
   Later, satisfied that no Drexel capital was involved, execution
of Pforzheimer trades was allowed to continue. But a message had
been sent that Drexel's troubles might also be woes for the rest of
Wall Street.
   ``It's everybody's problem in the market because everybody has
done business with Drexel and is still doing so,'' Bostrom said.
   ``I do know it's got this place in a very negative mood ... and
the market at this juncture doesn't need much of anything to have
the stilts knocked out from under it.''

   Nelson Mandela came home a hero
Tuesday, welcomed after nearly three decades by an ecstatic throng
of blacks who delighted in his freedom but also heard him mourn the
oppression of apartheid.
   More than 120,000 people crammed into the country's largest
stadium to greet the man revered by most South African blacks as
their leader. Many were getting their first glimpse of him.
   ``The march toward freedom and justice is irreversible,''
Mandela told the roaring crowd in the township that has become one
of the bleakest symbols of apartheid.
   At what the independent South African Press Association called
the largest political rally ever in southern Africa, Mandela
exhorted blacks to end their factional disputes, take control of a
crisis-ridden school system, and work with discipline to end
white-minority rule.
   Whites, he said, must be reassured that ``a South Africa without
apartheid will be a better place for all.''
   Some spectators came six hours early to get seats, and the
80,000-seat stadium was overflowing by the time Mandela arrived.
Youths perched precariously on wall tops, others scaled
120-foot-high light towers, and more than 30 people were injured as
crowds shoved and pushed to get a view of the podium.
   An explosion of joy shook the stadium when Mandela, 71, emerged
from an underground walkway, saluting with a raised fist.
   ``Mandela! Mandela!'' the crowd roared as he slowly walked
around the field, flanked by top leaders of his African National
Congress and other anti-apartheid groups. People thrust fists into
the air and danced as Mandela passed them.
   ``Today, my return to Soweto fills my heart with joy,'' Mandela
said. ``At the same time, I have returned with a deep sense of
sadness that you are still suffering under an unjust system.''
   In Cape Town, the government issued its first formal response to
Mandela's statements since his release Sunday after more than 27
years in prison.
   Constitutional Development Minister Gerrit Viljoen said the
government agreed with Mandela that apartheid must be eliminated
and voting rights extended to blacks. But he criticized Mandela's
support for continued guerrilla violence and economic sanctions.
   ``The government is not prepared to accede to the handing over
of power,'' Viljoen said. ``If that is the goal of the armed
struggle, then there is no meaningful way ahead.''
   President F.W. de Klerk, who ordered Mandela's unconditional
release, replied when ABC newsman Ted Koppel asked him in an
interview Tuesday why after 27 years he decided now was the time to
free Mandela:
   ``In South Africa, life sentences usually come to an end at 25
years. But there is also the political side. First the officials,
ministers of the state and finally my predecessor started to talk
to Mr. Mandela. And the commitment to peace came through. Also in
the two discussions that I have had with him the commitment to
peaceful solutions came through.''
   The interview was broadcast in part on ``ABC News.''
   Mandela, speaking from a podium on the playing field, said the
thought of returning to Soweto helped him endure his years in
prison, serving a life term for starting the ANC's guerrilla war.
   ``God bless Africa,'' the crowd sang in rolling cadences after
Mandela ended his speech, raised his fist again and joined in the
anthem of the anti-apartheid movement.
   Two helicopters then descended onto the field and took him, his
family and top aides to a smaller stadium in Soweto. From there he
drove in a motorcade _ escorted by Soweto police with ANC flags on
their motorcyles _ to the modest, four-roomed brick house he lived
in before his arrest.
   Mandela waved to about 2,000 people waiting outside, then walked
into his home.
   In his nearly 30-minute speech, Mandela deplored the poverty and
suffering endured by many in Soweto, a sprawling township of 2.5
million people that has been a home base for the anti-apartheid
movement.
   ``Our people need proper housing, not ghettos like Soweto,'' he
said. ``Our people need a living wage.''
   Dressed in a gray suit and wearing reading glasses, he echoed
the major themes he has addressed since his release.
   He said the ANC would ``continue the armed struggle as long as
the violence of apartheid continues.'' He also condemned
black-against-black violence, saying it had weakened the fight
against apartheid.
   ``We must take bold steps ... to end the mindless violence'' in
Natal Province, he said. More than 50 blacks have been killed in
fighting there this week, and more than 2,500 since 1986.
   He also addressed the white-run security forces, which he said
many blacks view as instruments of repression.
   ``I call on the police to abandon apartheid,'' he said. ``Join
in the march to new South Africa, where you also have a place.''
   In remarks aimed at quelling white fears, he said: ``I and the
ANC are as opposed to black domination as we are to white
domination. I must accept that our statements ... are not enough to
allay the fears of the white population.''
   ``A new South Africa has to eliminate hatred and suspicion
caused by apartheid, and (substitute) it with peace.''
   ``Go back to your schools, churches, mines and communities and
build on the massive energy of recent events in our country,''
Mandela said.
   Soweto schools were virtually deserted because pupils were
taking part in the celebrations. Tens of thousands of adults stayed
away from work.
   ``I am so happy,'' said spectator Tebello Pooe in broken
English. ``I am proud because how long have we been waiting for
Nelson Mandela. We are near to get what we are hoping for _
freedom.''
   Huge columns of people blocked every street leading to the
stadium even after the facility was full. Overloaded buses with
youths perched on their roofs inched along the streets.
   The crowd was orderly, heeding a call from Mandela to behave
with dignity. Also Tuesday the white, right-wing Conservative Party
filed treason charges with police against Mandela and fellow black
leaders Walter Sisulu and Zeph Mothopeng. The pro-apartheid party
claimed Mandela's remarks since Sunday were a call to overthrow the
government.
   Citizens can file private charges that police investigate to
determine if any action should be taken. It is unlikely the
governing National Party would allow any official action.
   The ANC seeks a one-person, one-vote system, which would be
dominated by South Africa's 28 million blacks. De Klerk seeks to
negotiate a new constitution that would establish some political
rights for blacks, but provide the 5 million whites with some sort
of veto over major decisions.
   On Feb. 2, de Klerk lifted a 30-year ban on the ANC and other
opposition groups, suspended executions and announced other reforms
aimed at clearing the way for black-white negotiations.

<TEXT>
   West Germany's ARD television network went live on
Tuesday to its correspondent in Ottawa, who gave the news of the
accord there on German reunification shortly after 11 p.m.
   ARD said in its account that the way seemed clear for most of
the points, but that the foreign ministers had ``set to one side''
temporarily the tricky question of the military posture of a united
Germany.
   In East Berlin, the official news agency ADN distributed the
news at 10:43 p.m.
   ``The discussions will also include the questions of security of
neighboring states,'' said the brief report.
   According to a statement obtained by The Associated Press in
Ottawa, the United States, Britain and France on Tuesday worked out
an agreement with the Soviet Union and both Germanys on a two-stage
formula to reunite the two Germanys after 45 years of division.
   In the first stage, East Germany and West Germany would meet on
legal, economic and political issues, according to the statement.
The talks would begin soon after East Germany holds its March 18
national elections.
   In the second stage, the foreign ministers of the two Germanys
would meet with the foreign ministers of the United States, France,
Britain and the Soviet Union ``to discuss external aspects of the
establishment of German unity, including the issues of security of
the neighboring states.''

<TEXT>
   Seconds before the Exxon Valdez went
aground, the third mate in control of the tanker testified Tuesday
that he called skipper Joseph Hazelwood to tell him the tanker was
``getting into serious trouble.''
   The message was interrupted by a crash, Gregory Cousins
testified at Hazelwood's trial.
   Cousins and a helmsman, Robert Kagan, were at the wheel when the
987-foot tanker ran aground on Bligh Reef, spilling more than 10
million gallons of North Slope crude in the nation's worst oil
spill.
   Cousins said he had begun to realize that Kagan was not properly
following his orders to make hard turns in the ship's course.
   ``I could tell we hadn't turned,'' he said. And after giving
another order to Kagan to turn harder, Counsins said he phoned the
captain.
   ``I told him that we were getting into serious trouble,'' he
recalled. ``He asked, `Where's the rudder?...' That was when we
suffered the first shock and we were hard aground.''
   Asked what further was said during the conversation, Cousins
said, ``There was nothing else to say. There was a mutual hangup of
the telephones.''
   Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y., is charged with one felony
count of second-degree criminal mischief and misdemeanor charges of
reckless endangerment, negligent discharge of oil and operating a
vessel while intoxicated. The maximum penalty for conviction on all
counts is seven years, three months in prison and $61,000 in fines.
   Cousins testified Tuesday that after the ship ran aground, the
tanker was still moving.
   ``The vessel was swinging rapidly to the right ... I knew we
were hard aground. My fear was that we were sliding down the reef.
The aft end of the vessel was sliding into the rocks and we had
people down in the engine room,'' said Cousins.
   He said he gave an urgent order to Kagan to turn hard left.
   ``I think Mr. Kagan didn't really understand the command,'' he
said. ``He hesitated and I spun the wheel.''
   He said he had never worked with Kagan before and had heard
rumors the seaman had problems with steering on another voyage.
   He said Hazelwood had left the bridge only about 10 minutes
before the accident, leaving specific orders for rerouting the ship.
   ``He asked if I felt comfortable with what we were going to do
and I said, `Yes,''' Cousins testified. ``He said, `Do you feel
comfortable enough that I can go below and get rid of some
paperwork?' I said I felt very comfortable.''
   Cousins said Hazelwood told him would be gone ``just a few
minutes'' and to call him in his cabin when the ship started to
make a turn.
   Cousins, who was described Monday as being frantic in the
moments before the ship ran aground, told of fairly smooth sailing
until the hour before disaster struck.
   In a slow, painstaking delivery, the third mate explained to
jurors how tankers operate, how radar works and the difference
between magnetic and true north. He told of many conversations with
Hazelwood about the course the Exxon Valdez would follow into
Prince William Sound.
   The prosecution is seeking to show that Hazelwood abdicated his
responsibility for command of the ship when he went below and left
Cousins in charge.
   Cousins described the night of the accident as extremely dark
and misty. He said that about an hour before the grounding he
spotted ice on the ship's radar screen. It was too dark to actually
see the ice from the deck, Cousins said, but he reported it to
Hazelwood, who decided to divert the tanker from normal shipping
lanes to avoid the ice.
   At the point where the evasive maneuver was beginning, Cousins
said the shift changed and a new helmsman, Kagan, arrived. At some
point, he said, the tanker was placed on automatic pilot but he did
not know when or for how long.
   Hazelwood contends that he left clear orders with Cousins for
the ship's direction and that if his orders had been obeyed the
disaster never would have occurred.
   Cousins testified that he has been on the crew of various ships
for as many as 26 trips through the Valdez Narrows into Prince
William Sound. But prosecutors have stressed that he did not have a
special license to pilot a ship in that area.
   Kagan testified Monday that Cousins panicked and grabbed the
wheel in a futile attempt to avert the jagged reef.
   ``I started making the turn and he grabbed the wheel and helped
make it,'' Kagan said. ``I think he was kind of panicking then. ...
He was kind of excited.''

   Ronald Reagan's lawyers asked a judge Tuesday
to bar reporters and the public from the courtroom when the former
president gives videotaped testimony Friday in the Iran-Contra case
of his former national security adviser, John Poindexter.
   Iran-Contra prosecutors and the Justice Department joined
Reagan's lawyers in saying that news organizations have no
constitutional right to attend the pre-trial deposition.
   ``Even if there were a constitutional interest in the press'
attendance at the deposition ... that interest is outweighed by the
significant risk of disclosure of confidential information,''
Reagan's lawyers said in a filing in U.S. District Court.
   The Justice Department said in a court brief that a closed
deposition was the only way to prevent inadvertent disclosure of
sensitive information.
   ``There is no other means to prevent the disclosure of national
security matters unless they are edited out before the videotaped
deposition is made public,'' the department said.
   Reagan's lawyers urged that the videotape and any transcripts of
it be sealed until the videotape is played back to the jury at
Poindexter's trial.
   Iran-Contra prosecutors, however, said the court should consider
the news organizations' alternate request for access to the edited
videotape and censored transcripts of the deposition after it is
completed.
   The prosecutors said the protection of sensitive national
security information is a compelling governmental interest
``sufficient to justify precluding the media from attending this
proceeding.''
   Twelve news organizations have asked U.S. District Court Judge
Harold Greene, who is presiding in the Poindexter case, for
admission to Reagan's deposition at the federal courthouse in Los
Angeles.
   If necessary, the news organizations said, Greene could order
closing of the deposition during lines of questioning that may
elicit sensitive information.
   Arguing for an open deposition, Poindexter's lawyers said
Reagan's testimony presents no special problems of classified
information that distinguish it from the testimony of several other
key witnesses in the case.
   In the unlikely event that classified information does seep out
inadvertently, the court might be able to strike the information
from the public record and preclude publication of that
information, they argued.
   The proposal by the 12 organizations ``defies common sense,''
said Reagan's lawyers. ``There is no possible way to predict which
questions posed to the former President would elicit confidential
or national security information.''
   They said such an approach would lead to ``disruptive''
restrictions on the sequence of questions or ``significant
interruptions'' occasioned by repeated press entry and exit to the
deposition.
   Reagan's testimony is to be edited and played back at the trial
of Poindexter, who last week was given permission by Greene to ask
Reagan 154 questions plus follow-ups.
   Iran-Contra prosecutors will cross-examine Reagan at the same
session.
   The former president agreed last Friday to submit to the
questioning, while reserving the option of invoking executive
privilege on specific questions. The Justice Department will send
representatives to the testimony so that the Bush administration
may block responses that may impinge on national security.
   Executive privilege is the doctrine that certain deliberations
of a president and his advisers in fulfilling their constitutional
duties may be kept secret. The Supreme Court has ruled that the
need for evidence in a criminal trial may in certain circumstances
require breaching that secrecy.
   The former national security adviser faces trial March 5 on
charges of conspiracy, obstruction and making false statements in
the Iran-Contra scandal.
   The news organizations applying to have Reagan's testimony given
in public are Cable News Network Inc., Capital Cities-ABC Inc., CBS
Inc., National Broadcasting Co. Inc., The New York Times Co., The
Times Mirror Co. of Los Angeles, The Washington Post, The
Associated Press, Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc., National Public Radio, USA

<HEAD>NATO, Warsaw Pact Reach Tentative Pact On Surveillance Overflights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THOMAS GINSBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NATO and Warsaw Pact negotiators agreed Tuesday on
the basic elements of a plan to open their skies to surveillance
overflights.
   After two days of talks, the 23 members of both military blocs
took a break from high-powered meetings on German unification and
European troop-cut treaties to issue a statement accepting the
basic principles of ``Open Skies.''
   The plan, first proposed in the 1950s and resurrected by
President Bush last May, calls for members of both alliances to let
surveillance aircraft fly over their territory. The aim is to
enhance trust and openness, in addition to monitoring compliance
with disarmament treaties.
   The communique made no mention of a Warsaw Pact proposal to
share planes, surveillance equipment and information, the most
controversial element still to be worked out in the plan.
   The Soviet Union and United States had accepted the broad
outline of the plan before the Ottawa meeting.
   ``The `Open Skies' regime is neither an arms control nor a
verification measure per se,'' the communique said. ``Its
successful implementation would encourage reciprocal openness on
the part of participating states. It would strengthen confidence
among them, reduce the risk of conflict, and enhance the
predictability of military activities.''
   The negotiators agreed to four points:
   _The North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact will
implement the plan ``on a reciprocal and equitable basis,'' and the
``Open Skies regime ... will ensure the maximum possible openness
and minimum restrictions for observation flights.''
   _Each country will have an annual quota of flights, the quotas
to be decided at future negotiations.
   The original plan called for larger countries to allow several
flights a month over their territory and smaller countries to have
at least one every three months. Both alliances were to have
roughly the same number of flights.
   _Countries will use unarmed aircraft and certain types of
surveillance equipment to be decided during negotiations.
   _Other countries, notably the non-aligned nations of Europe,
will be encouraged eventually to participate in ``Open Skies.''
   All NATO and Warsaw Pact foreign ministers will meet in
Budapest, Hungary, on May 12 to sign a final agreement, said
Foreign Minister Gyula Horn of Hungary.
   Lower-level officials will continue meeting for two weeks in
Ottawa to work out the remaining issues.
   Although NATO had rejected the Soviet idea of shared aircraft
and information, both sides have expressed willingness to
compromise.
   Foreign ministers from most of the 16 NATO and seven Warsaw Pact
contries have praised the ``Open Skies'' plan and said any
remaining disputes are not likely to block a final agreeement.
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III opened the conference
Monday by calling the plan ``potentially the most ambitious measure
to build confidence that we have ever taken.''
   West Germany's foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, said
Tuesday he was convinced ``this openness and cooperation will
increasingly become the natural form of relationship in Europe and
North America.''
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze on Monday proposed
expanding the surveillance concept to sea and space, but U.S.
officials quickly rejected the idea and it appeared to go no
further.
   The ``Open Skies'' plan is not linked formally to any other
treaty negotiations. But officials hoped early agreement could ease
verification questions in the Vienna talks on cutting conventional
forces.
   Most smaller countries welcome the ``Open Skies'' plan because
they lack the satellite technology to conduct surveillance on their
own.
   East bloc countries, all of whose hard-line Communist leaders
have lost power in the past year, face critical economic conditions
and some expressed reluctance to take on the expense of overflights.
   Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier said Monday that,
``At a time when we are embarking on the very complicated period of
transition to a market-based economy, we could only with difficulty
assume excessive financial commitments.''

   A Japanese subsidiary of the French bottler of
Perrier mineral water said Tuesday it will withdraw its product
from stores after the discovery of a tiny amount of contamination
in Perrier water in the United States.
   Mika Iiyoshi, an official of Perrier Japon K.K., said the
company will voluntarily withdraw about 10,000 cases from store
shelves immediately until the Japanese Health and Welfare Ministry
confirms the mineral water's safety.
   The Australian importers of Perrier said in Sydney Wednesday
that the government and independent laboratories were testing
random samples on supplies of Perrier. A spokesman for Coca-Cola
Amatil said no contamination had been discovered so far, and
Perrier had not been withdrawn from sale in Australia.
   Ms. Iiyoshi said the French government inspected the source of
the mineral water, a spring in Vergeze, southern France, after the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration discovered benzene in some
bottles in North Carolina.
   The water since has been taken out of stores, restaurants and
bars in the United States and Canada.
   Perrier said it believes an employee mistakenly used a product
containing benzene, a cancer-causing chemical, to clean grease from
one bottling line. A spokesman for the French Health Ministry said
there was no contamination at the spring from which the sparkling
water flows.
   Although the benzene levels were relatively low _ about two to
four times the five parts per billion level allowed under FDA
standards _ Perrier said it requested the recall Friday to protect
consumer confidence.
   Ms. Iiyoshi said it will take several days for the Japanese
Health and Welfare Ministry's investigation.
   An official of the ministry, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the agency is collecting information from the
United States while checking whether the mineral water in the
Japanese market is contaminated.
   Ms. Iiyoshi said Perrier Japon markets 150,000 cases of Perrier
water a year.

   President Daniel Ortega said Tuesday that about
2,000 Contras have infiltrated Nicaragua in an attempt to sabotage
the campaign leading up to national elections Feb. 25.
   Ortega said the Contras plan to ``contest electoral results,
since two North American opinion polls clearly indicate a
Sandinista victory.''
   Two surveys conducted in January by the U.S.-based pollsters
Greenberg Lake and Bendixen Schroth gave Ortega's Sandinista Front
a strong lead over his major rival, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro of
the United National Opposition, known as UNO.
   Ortega said he met with Roman Catholic Cardinal Miguel Obando y
Bravo to discuss his claims that 2,000 Contras plan to ``block the
electoral process with attacks, ambushes, etc., and create a
climate of terror in the war zones so that people won't vote.''
   The allegations could not be corroborated by non-government
sources.
   ``I expressed to the cardinal my worry about the verbal and
other kinds of violence ... of recent days,'' Ortega said.
   Obando y Bravo said he told Ortega, ``We believe that the
country can only move ahead through authentic reconciliation.''
   ``Hopefully the people of Nicaragua will be able to express
themselves on Feb. 25 without fear,'' he said.
   The church has conducted orientation sessions on the electoral
process.
   Ortega called on ``those who have plans to subvert the electoral
process to renounce their plans and accept this battle on civic
grounds.''
   In the poll by Greenberg Lake, 51 percent of those surveyed
supported Ortega, 24 Mrs. Chamorro and the rest were undecided or
backing minor candidates. Interviewers questioned 901 people around
the country for the poll, commissioned by Hemisphere Inititatives,
a Boston-based group that has been invited to observe the elections.
   The Bendixen Schroth poll, commissioned by the Spanish-language
network Univision in the United States, gave Ortega 53 percent of
the vote, Mrs. Chamorro 35 percent and said the rest either were
undecided or supported minor candidates.
   Neither of the pollsters disclosed the method of interviewing or
the margin of error in the surveys.
   The Contras began fighting the government with U.S. backing in
1981, claiming the Sandinistas had betrayed the goals of the 1979
revolution that toppled the family dynasty of Anastasio Somoza.
   Many Contras have given up the struggle and returned to civilian
life in Nicaragua, but others remain hostile to the Sandinistas.
   Some Contras still live in camps along the Honduran border. The
United States has stopped arming them but Congress is expected to
discuss continuing non-lethal aid, which runs out at the end of the
month.
   The Bush administration has indicated it wants the Contra force
to remain in existence until after the elections as pressure for
free and fair balloting.

<HEAD>Researcher Links Fat To Body Rhythms, Sees Weight Loss Without A
Diet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new study linking natural body rhythms
to fat and cholesterol has raised the possibility that patients
could lose weight without special exercise or diet, researchers
said Tuesday.
   ``All you need to do is take a pill, but you have to do it at
the right time of day for the individual,'' said Albert Meier,
professor of zoology at Louisiana State University, who initiated
the research.
   The results of the study were announced by LSU, which has
patented the procedure and licensed it to a Boston diabetes clinic
for further clinical tests and application for U.S. Food and Drug
Administration approval.
   The procedure, in which small amounts of the drug bromocryptine
were given at specific times, was tested on 70 patients by Baton
Rouge physician C. William Lovell, and the results are being
prepared for scientific publication, the university said.
   The first 33 patients in the study lost 25 percent or more of
their fat within six weeks, although they were allowed to eat
anything and did no special exercise.
   Meier said people don't get fat because they eat too much or are
lazy, but because their body produces fat in a rhythmic kind of
biology similar to that experienced by animals during migration or
hibernation.
   He said the discovery grew out of 25 years of research that
started with white-throated sparrows, which build up body fat
before their long migrations without eating any extra food or
cutting down their activity.
   Meier, who has published extensive research on birds and fish,
said he expanded his focus to include mammals when he saw the
possibilities for humans.
   Other researchers in obesity called the concept interesting and
said it would be the first bridge between human weight loss and
studies of fat in hibernation and migration.
   ``I hope he's right,'' said Elliot Danforth Jr., director of the
clinical research center at the University of Vermont. ``We need a
breakthrough in this area.''
   However, he said he could not assess the study without seeing
how the researchers monitored what people ate _ or didn't eat,
since the nausea from bromocryptine could possibly reduce appetite.
   And he said it would be tricky finding the exact time of day in
which the pill would work.
   ``The proof will be in the clinical effect,'' said Dr. George
Bray, an authority on obesity who directs the Pennington Biomedical
Research Center in Baton Rouge. But applying the medication in
rhythmic doses ``may be enough to make it work,'' Bray said.
   Meier said the bromocryptine works by inhibiting secretion of
the hormone prolactin. Prolactin is linked to the body's use of
insulin, which scientists have known for years has caused fat
production, he said.
   ``Prolactin's major function is to maintain receptors in the
liver that respond to insulin. The higher the level of prolactin at
a specific time of day, the more abundant the receptors and
consequently the greater the fat production by the liver,'' he said.
   ``Inhibiting prolactin cuts down on the number of receptors and
thus the amount of fat produced.''
   Bromocryptine is already FDA-approved and in weight loss is used
in tiny doses, as small as one-hundredth of the normal dosage.
   Meier said actual weight loss per person averaged about 5
percent.
   ``Only fat was removed _ no water, proteins or carbohydrates,''
he said.
   Lovell said he took the drug and lost 11 pounds in six weeks.
The only side effect was some nausea, he said.
   Meier and LSU adjunct professor Anthony Cincotta, now associated
with Wellman Laboratory, part of Massachusetts General Hospital and
Harvard Medical School in Boston, reported the results of their
study with animals in December in the journal Life Sciences.
   In the article, they said that within 10 to 15 days, body fat
was reduced 15 to 50 percent and cholesterol 15 to 40 percent in
several animal models, including pigs.
   LSU has signed an agreement with ERGO Inc., a biotechnology
company in Newport, R.I., to market the research.

   Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov
came down with a fever and cold Wednesday and postponed the signing
of several bilateral fishing and trade agreements, a spokesman said.
   The Soviet spokesman said the signings would be held Thursday.
   Ryzhkov, the highest-ranking Kremlin official ever to visit
Australia, is on the second day of a three-day trip as part of a
Pacific tour aimed at forging closer economic ties.
   He arrived Tuesday in Melbourne from Bangkok, Thailand, and was
greeted by Prime Minister Bob Hawke and Foreign Minister Gareth
Evans. He flew to Canberra on Wednesday morning.
   Ryzhkov, the main architect of Soviet economic reform, is
scheduled to sign agreements on matters including port access for
Soviet fishing trawlers and consular guarantees and commodities
deals.
   He spent Tuesday inspecting the distribution center for the
Australian-owned Safeway supermarket chain and later officially
opened a Center for Soviet and East European Studies at the
University of Melbourne.
   Vadim P. Perfiliev, deputy chief of the Soviet Foreign Ministry
Information Department, said the computerized distribution and
management at the 47-acre supermarket complex could be useful in
the Soviet Union.
   Shortages of food and inefficient distribution are two of the
Soviet government's most pressing problems.
   At a dinner given by Premier John Cain of Victoria state,
Ryzhkov said the Communist Party's historic decision to give up its
monopoly on power is only one of many political reforms and
economic changes to come in his nation.
   ``Despite the difficulties, we are determined to continue along
the road we have mapped out,'' he said.
   He said reforms now under way were the most radical ever carried
out to ``democratize the whole of our society and develop a new
federalism in my country.''
   Ryzhkov also said the Soviets want ``to find a radical solution
to the disarmament problem, to remove the threat of a nuclear war
and resolve grave regional conflicts.''
   Ryzhkov and his party are to visit Sydney, Australia's largest
city and a major Pacific financial center, on Thursday and travel
to Singapore, his last stop, on Friday.

   The United States and the Soviet Union agreed
Tuesday on a sharp reduction in troop deployments in Central Europe
to 195,000 for each superpower, Canadian External Affairs Minister
Joseph Clark announced.
   The United States could keep up to 30,000 troops elsewhere in
Europe under the agreement, Clark said.
   The accord worked out during an ``open skies'' conference
represents Soviet acceptance of the initiative President Bush
unveiled in his State of the Union address Jan. 31.
   Clark made the announcement in a conference hall with Secretary
of State James A. Baker III, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze and other foreign ministers looking on. Baker and
Shevardnadze did not speak.
   The United States now has about 305,000 troops in Europe, of
which about 275,000 are on the central front _ mostly West Germany
_ and 30,000, generally in Navy and Air Force units, in Greece,
Turkey, Italy, Spain and Britain.
   The Soviet Union has about 565,000 in East Germany, Poland,
Hungary and Czechoslovakia _ four nations that have shed their
hardline communist governments.
   Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia are negotiating troop
reductions with the Soviet Union.
   Announcing the settlement, Clark said, ``It overcomes one of the
most difficult obstacles'' to a treaty NATO and the Warsaw Pact
have been negotiating since the 1970s in Vienna on limits to
conventional forces in Europe.
   Other key limits in the projected treaty would cover tanks and
other non-nuclear weapons.
   However, only Monday, Baker stressed in a speech to the
conference that the United States and the Soviet Union were in
disagreement on limits for combat aircraft. Without such agreement,
a treaty would be more difficult to reach.
   The agreement on troop ceilings, the first of its kind, was one
of three at the NATO-Warsaw pact conference capping an
extraordinary nine days of diplomacy that saw Baker confer with
allies and others in Ireland, Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union,
Romania, Bulgaria and finally in Ottawa.
   The second agreement establishes a two-stage process aimed at
German reunification in which the two Germanies confer, followed by
talks of their foreign ministers and those of the four powers that
defeated Nazi Germany in World War II, the United States, Britain,
France and the Soviet Union.
   In the third agreement, NATO and the Warsaw Pact agreed in
principle on ``open skies'' surveillance methods by which
reconnaissance aircraft of one side will fly over the territory of
the other. Details are to be worked out for a May 12 signing
ceremony in Budapest.
   During Baker's talks in Moscow last week, Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev proposed a somewhat different troop
arrangement _ equal levels for the United States and the Soviet
Union on European soil of either 195,000 or 225,000 each, with no
sub-ceiling for Central Europe.
   Baker took that proposal to the foreign ministers of the 15 U.S.
allies in NATO, who were assembled in Ottawa for a two-week
conference with the seven members of the Warsaw Pact on aerial
surveillance as a means of allaying suspicions of surprise attack.
   Shevardnadze said the accord was close to Gorbachev's proposals.
Referring to Bush's initiative, Shevardnadze told reporters: ``He
did not say he would not agree to that.''
   The foreign minister, with a twinkle, quipped: ``Are you
disappointed?''
   In Washington, the White House said in a statement, ``The
president is pleased that this agreement on manpower removes the
major obstacle to an early conclusion of a CFE (Conventional Forces
in Europe) treaty.''
   The accord on troop limitations capped a series of breakthroughs
during Baker's nine days in Europe and Canada
   In Moscow, he and Soviet officials broke the back of several key
issues that stood in the way of a treaty to reduce long-range
missiles, bombers and submarines by 30 to 50 percent.
   Sea-launched cruises missiles were separated from the emerging
treaty that Bush and Gorbachev intend to sign at their summit
meeting in Washington in June.
   Also, an agreement was worked out for destruction of chemical
weapons stock, also to be signed in June, provided other nations
capable of producing gas agree to an international treaty.
   After a farewell chat with Shevardnadze, Baker headed home for
Washington after a nine-day trip.

   The United tates and its major European allies
forged agreement with the Soviet Union and East Germany Tuesday on
a two-stage formula to reunite Germany 45 years after the World War
II victors divided it.
   The nations' foreign ministers released a terse statement on the
agreement, and U.S. officials added detail.
   In the first stage, East Germany and West Germany would meet on
legal, economic and political issues, according to the statement.
The talks would begin soon after East Germany holds its March 18
national elections.
   In the second stage the foreign ministers of the two Germanys
would meet with the foreign ministers of the United States, France,
Britain and the Soviet Union ``to discuss external aspects of the
establishment of German unity, including the issues of security of
the neighboring states.''
   The statement, hammered out at an East-West ``open skies''
conference, added that ``preliminary discussions at the official
level will begin shortly.''
   Although the statement was not specific, among the ``external
aspects'' to be considered by the Big Four allies of World War II _
who defeated Nazi Germany and its allies in the most devastating
war in history _ will be whether the new Germany is a member of the
main Western military alliance, the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   President Bush telephoned Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany
during the day to discuss final details of the agreement, according
to a White House statement Tuesday night.
   The news came late in the evening in Germany, too late for most
citizens to react immediately. The West German television network
broadcast a live report from its correspondent in Ottawa shortly
after 11 p.m. German time.
   ARD pointed out that the way seemed clear for most of the
points, but that the foreign ministers had ``set to one side''
temporarily the tricky question of the military posture of a united
Germany.
   In East Berlin, the official news agency ADN distributed the
news at 10:43 p.m. in a brief report that noted, ``The discussions
will also include the questions of security of neighboring states.''
   The agreement on German unification was one of three at the
NATO-Warsaw pact conference capping an extraordinary eight days of
diplomacy that saw U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III
confer with allies and others in Ireland, Czechoslovakia, the
Soviet Union, Romania, Bulgaria and finally in Ottawa.
   In the second agreement, announced by Canadian External Affairs
Minister Joe Clark, the United States and the Soviet Union agreed
on troop ceilings of 195,000 for each superpower in Central Europe
and an additional 30,000 for the United States elsewhere in Europe.
   In the third agreement, NATO and the Warsaw Pact agreed in
principle on ``open skies'' surveillance methods by which
reconnaissance aircraft of one side will fly over the territory of
the other. Details are to be worked out for a May 12 signing
ceremony in Budapest.
   The United States wants a united Germany to remain in the NATO
alliance, while the Soviet Union wants a neutral Germany. East
Germany now is a member of the Warsaw Pact.
   U.S. officials bill the plan as ``Two plus Four,'' a reference
to the four World War II allies and the two Germanys.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze met earlier Tuesday
with his West German counterpart, Hans-Dietrich Genscher and with
Baker.
   Genscher on Tuesday affirmed that East and West Germany would
reunite and sought to reassure the world that the new country would
not pose any threat to peace.
   ``We tell all our neighbors what we want to unite: The Federal
Republic of Germany, the German Democratic Republic and the whole
of Berlin _ no less, and no more. We do not have territorial claims
against any of our neighbors.''
   ``We seek a European Germany, not a German Europe,'' he said.
   Genscher made the comments to open the second day of a 23-nation
``Open Skies'' conference, the main topic of which has been
eclipsed by the German unity issue.
   In Bonn, Kohl and Communist Premier Hans Modrow met to discuss
monetary union. They agreed to set up a commission to study ways of
making the West German mark the official currency of East Germany.
   Three forces had been at work in the world powers' discussion:
   _A conviction Moscow grew to share with Washington that
unification was inevitable.
   _A Western desire to keep Germany in NATO.
   _Anxiety among people who suffered at Germany's hands in World
War II.
   Bush administration policymakers were operating on an assumption
those concerns could be allayed _ and any aggressive German
tendencies diverted _ by keeping Germany within the 16-member NATO.
   But State Department officials, speaking on condition their
names not be used, stressed that no outside power would have the
right to interfere in the Germans' sovereign decisions.
   Work toward the German reunification plan had been under way
quietly for several weeks, though the subject was not the stated
reason for a number of meetings Baker had with world leaders in and
out of Washington.
   Baker talked about the matter separately with British Foreign
Secretary Douglas Hurd and Genscher separately in Washington; with
French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas during a refueling stop en
route to Czechoslovakia, and finally, with Soviet leaders when he
reached Moscow last week.
   West Germany's Kohl and Genscher flew to Moscow last Saturday to
lobby for unification with East Germany.

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who is seeking a
big-power conference with both Germanys prior to reunification,
said Tuesday night that some European developments ``may stir
deeply felt anxieties.''
   Britain on Tuesday joined in an agreement in Ottawa on a
two-stage formula to reunite the two states after 45 years of
division.
   The United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France _ allies
in World War II _ and the two Germanys agreed that talks between
East Germany and West Germany would begin soon after East German's
March 18 elections. The six foreign ministers would meet later to
discuss security considerations.
   Speaking at a dinner in honor of visiting Polish Premier Tadeusz
Mazowiecki, Mrs. Thatcher said both Poland and Britain have had
experiences this century ``which we are determined should not
happen again'' _ an evident reference to Nazi Germany and World War
II.
   ``That is why we believe it is so important to work out very
carefully the implications of Germany's unification for existing
alliances, for the Helsinki accords and for the European
Community.''
   ``We understand and support your view that the present border of
Poland should be guaranteed,'' she told Mazowiecki, Poland's first
non-Communist prime minister since the war.
   West Germany has promised to respect Poland's border with East
Germany, saying it will not try to reclaim Polish territory
inhabited by ethnic Germans.
   Mrs. Thatcher said she accepted the Germans' right ``to
determine their own future in freedom.''
   ``But it is vital that Germany's unification should uphold, not
weaken, Europe's stability and security. That is why these matters
must be very carefully worked out in full consultation with
Germany's allies and neighbors.''
   In his reply, Mazowiecki also referred anxiously to German
unification. ``How will the Germans settle the problem of their
constitutional unity to which, as any other nation, they are
unquestionably entitled?'' he asked.
   Thatcher aides, speaking on condition of anonymity, had said
earlier she wants any formulas that emerge from talks to be
presented to an East-West summit meeting of the 35-nation
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe due this year.
   Mrs. Thatcher is to discuss the proposal in London Wednesday
with West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher.
   Mrs. Thatcher's plan is seen as a response to critics who accuse
her of seeking to slow the momentum toward reunification. She has
not disguised her concern that hasty moves could undermine European
security.
   Jacques Delors, president of the European Community executive
commission, suggested Tuesday that the 12-nation bloc hold a
special summit on German unification after the East German
elections.
   No German peace treaty was signed after World War II. Although
the United States, Britain and France renounced their status as
occupiers in 1955, they retain authority in Berlin and maintain
armies in West Germany.

<HEAD>Big Investment Firm's Crisis Has Profound Implications</HEAD>

would file Tuesday night. A version moved on the financial wire.</NOTE>

   The impact of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s
stunning decline reaches like an octopus beyond Wall Street and
junk bonds, potentially threatening many businesses that depend on
financial markets to raise money.
   The Drexel bankruptcy filing could inject more sellers into the
already depressed junk bond market which the firm dominates,
creating a confidence crisis that might spread into stocks,
higher-grade corporate debt and other securities, investment
experts and business executives said Tuesday.
   Such turmoil would affect the broader economy, possibly by
pushing interest rates and the dollar higher in opposition to
government attempts to sustain economic growth.
   Drexel said its parent company was filing Tuesday night for
federal bankruptcy court protection from creditors, due to problems
stemming from the deterioration of the junk market and the impact
on its financial holdings.
   Many expressed surprise at the frightening speed with which
Drexel, formerly one of the most powerful investment banks, hurtled
toward collapse because of the junk bond market it was largely
responsible for creating.
   ``It took a long time to string together this enterprise, and
not much time at all for it to crack up,'' said James Grant, author
of a prominent financial newsletter that frequently has warned
against the perils of junk-bond debt.
   Others likened Drexel's demise to a disaster that will further
erode the tarnished credibility of the depressed securities
industry overall and persuade investors to shun investments that
have no relation to junk bonds.
   This could force companies that historically have relied on
selling stocks and bonds for new capital to curtail spending plans,
lay off workers or even seek bankruptcy protection themselves.
   ``Does Three Mile Island ring a bell with you?'' said Paul E.
Berg, president of Berg Fiduciary Consultants, an investment
advisory firm in Port Chester, N.Y.
   ``When we had the explosion and problems at Three Mile Island,
it impacted the entire utilities industry,'' Berg said, referring
to the 1979 nuclear accident. ``You've got pretty much the same
situation here.''
   Drexel vaulted to prominence in the 1980s by aggressively
peddling high-interest securities with low credit ratings as a way
to raise money for businesses seeking to expand. The securities
became known as junk bonds because of their relatively higher risk
of default compared with investment-grade corporate bonds.
   Even before Drexel's latest problems, a number of prominent
deals that depended on junk-bond financing had begun unraveling or
faced serious obstacles. Drexel played a role in many of them.
   On Tuesday, for example, Drexel client Integrated Resources
Inc., a diversified financial services company that has been
struggling for months, sought federal bankruptcy protection.
   Earlier this month federal regulators seized Florida's biggest
thrift, CenTrust Bank, blaming its failure partly on risky
investments in Drexel junk bonds. CenTrust is one of Integrated's
leading creditors.
   Banks, insurers, pension funds, mutual funds and other investors
who bought junk bonds because they promised such high rates of
interest could wind up owning nearly worthless pieces of paper,
some financial strategists said.
   ``Now the reality is beginning to sink in, it's coming home to
roost, that when people originally called them `junk bonds,' that's
exactly what they were,'' said Jack Barbanel, managing director of
First Global Asset Management, an investment company in Princeton,
N.J.
   Others emphasized, however, that the overall number of junk
bonds held by most investors remains only a tiny percentage of
their portfolios. The total value of assets held by pension funds,
for example, is more than $2.5 trillion, while the entire junk bond
market once amounted to about $200 billion.
   ``If everybody owned a piece of a junk bond it would be pretty
small,'' said William Overgard, director of investment consulting
at Buck Pension Fund Services in New York.
   Drexel's destiny changed dramatically after the 1987 stock
market crash and its involvement in the Ivan Boesky insider trading
scandal, for which the company paid record penalties and agreed to
unprecedented government scrutiny.
   Drexel has since shrunken to half its former size, forced to
sell some operations because of the agreement with the government.
Still, Drexel has remained the pre-eminent marketer of junk bonds,
which have plunged in price during recent months because of rising
concern that the debts won't be repaid.
   Throughout its rise and fall, Drexel has enjoyed strong client
loyalty because of what supporters call the company's culture of
hard work and dedication.Many expressed sorrow at the company's
latest crisis.
   ``I think the whole thing is a terrible tragedy,'' said Bernard
Salick, chairman and chief executive officer of Salick Healthcare
Inc., a chain of outpatient health care centers that Drexel helped
finance. ``It's going to have reverberations through so many
industries, like one after the other.''

   An adviser to Mikhail S. Gorbachev
acknowledged on Tuesday that some East European nations may
eventually may leave the Warsaw Pact, the Soviet military alliance.
   Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev, former Soviet chief of staff, was
asked in an interview whether he thought one or two of the seven
Warsaw Pact members might withdraw, and replied: ``Probably.'' He
would not say which ones.
   Hungary and Czechoslovakia are negotiating for removal of Soviet
military forces from their territory. Akhromeyev said the Kremlin
was willing to discuss troop withdrawals with Poland, but had not
received a formal request.
   He also repeated the Soviet position, expressed by the Soviet
president last week, that the maximum number of U.S. and Soviet
soldiers allowed in Europe must be identical in an agreement to
reduce conventional forces.
   President Bush had said Monday the Gorbachev proposal was
unacceptable.
   But on Tuesday, the United States and the Soviet Union agreed in
Ottawa on a deep cut in troop deployments in Central Europe to
195,000 each, with the United States allowed to keep up to 30,000
troops elsewhere in Europe, Canadian External Affairs Minister
Joseph Clark announced.
   The agreement, worked out during an ``open skies'' conference,
represents Soviet acceptance of an initiative Bush unveiled on Jan.
31.
   An estimated 565,000 Red Army soldiers are stationed in Europe
outside Soviet territory. The United States has 305,000, most of
them in West Germany.
   NATO and the Warsaw Pact also agreed in principle in Ottawa on
Tuesday on ``open skies'' surveillance methods by which
reconnaissance aircraft of one side will fly over the territory of
the other. Details are to be worked out for a May 12 signing
ceremony in Budapest.
   Speaking through an interpreter, Akhromeyev said he thought most
nations ``will continue to stick to their organizations, united by
some common nature of interests, so I believe the Warsaw Pact will
continue to exist.''
   ``If one or two states would pull out of the Warsaw Treaty, part
of the military contingents will withdraw from the combined armed
forces,'' Akhromeyev said. ``This is going to be for those states
to decide.''
   The statement, once unthinkable, reflect the great changes in
the Soviet bloc, where virtually all nations have renounced the
Communist Party's dominant role in society and have embraced
democratic changes.
   Akhromeyev is on the defense committee of the Soviet legislature
and is in Brussels for meetings sponsored by the North Atlantic
Assembly, which consists of legislators from the 16 nations of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   Some of the Soviet legislators are to confer on Wednesday with
Manfred Woerner, a West German who is secretary-general of the
Western alliance.
   Akhromeyev said he thought negotiators for NATO and the Warsaw
Pact could complete an agreement in Vienna this year on reducing
the number of tanks, artillery and other non-nuclear arms in Europe.
   The toughest issue, he said, was a formula for combat aircraft.
Negotiators ``will have to undertake really great efforts in order
to find a solution to this problem,'' but leaving it out of the
accord was ``out of the question,'' Akhromeyev said.
   A sticking point has been Soviet insistence on excluding
thousands of defensive aircraft the West wants included in the
count.
   Akhromeyev said the timing for withdrawal of soldiers from
Hungary and Czechoslovakia would be fixed in the talks, but ``I
don't believe it is going to be a lengthy process.''
   As for Poland, he said, once a request for negotiations was
received, ``we are going to engage in the talks and have our forces
removed from there.''
   He said the 380,000 soldiers stationed in East Germany were
there because of agreements reached after World War II.
   ``The legal basis for stationing our forces there is the same as
the legal basis for the American troops, British troops and French
troops'' in West Germany, Akhromeyev said.
   He would not discuss what security arrangements the Soviets
would want for a unified German state, but said Moscow would ``not
say anything against'' the reunification process or oppose efforts
``to have a reunited Germany a neutral nation.''
   West Germany is part of NATO and East Germany belongs to the
Warsaw Pact. Western officials insist a united Germany remain in
NATO.
   Another agreement at Ottawa Tuesday establishes a two-stage
process aimed at German reunification in which the two Germanys
confer, followed by talks of their foreign ministers and those of
the four powers that defeated Nazi Germany in World War II, the
United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union.

   George Bush is no stranger to danger in
Colombia. Eight years ago, as vice president, he escaped an
apparent assassination plot in which a load of dynamite was buried
under the lone runway at the Bogota international airport.
   The explosives were found hours after Bush's plane took off.
Only then did security officials discover the dynamite connected to
wires running to an electrical generator 300 yards away.
   The 1982 incident provides a sharp reminder of the risks Bush
faces as he prepares to fly to Colombia on Thursday for a six-hour
drug summit with the presidents of Colombia, Peru and Bolivia.
   Colombian authorities say about 5,000 security agents will be
deployed when the leaders meet at a heavily guarded naval base near
the coastal resort of Cartagena.

   Drexel Burnham, which became a Wall Street
powerhouse through its pioneering use of high-risk junk bonds to
help finance the 1980s takeover boom, is looking for outside help
because of its deteriorating holdings.
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s announcement Monday that it is
seeking a major investor or merger partner followed three days of
talks with federal regulators, who worried that a collapse of the
firm would shake confidence in the nation's financial markets, The
New York Times reported today.
   Securities industry analysts and former Drexel executives echoed
those concerns. They said its difficulties with the declining
junk-bond market it helped create and its 1989 guilty plea to
federal securities fraud could deter potential investors.
   ``At this point I think the biggest problem is the loss of
confidence in them,'' said Chris Mahoney, analyst with Moody's
Investors Service. ``Who would want to do business with them if
they were a risk not to make it?''

   Under pressure from the auto and petroleum
industries, the Bush administration is backing away from a proposal
that would require millions of alternative fuel cars to be sold in
cities most plagued by smog.
   The phasing in of cars powered by fuels such as methanol or
natural gas was a centerpiece of President Bush's clean air
proposal last summer. The White House envisioned use of up to 1
million such vehicles annually by 1997 in an attempt to ``reconcile
the automobile to the environment.''
   But William Reilly, head of the Environmental Protection Agency,
acknowledged Monday that the administration no longer considers
mandatory production of alternative fuel cars as an essential part
of clean air legislation.
   Instead, the administration is proposing in negotiations with
Senate leaders that ``reformulated'' gasoline, which also cuts
pollution, would be welcomed as an alternative to the alternative
fuel vehicles.

<HEAD>Cancer Comes to Nancy on ``thirtysomething''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nancy, a character in ``thirtysomething,'' the
ABC chronicle of the lives of ordinary people of a certain age, is
encountering one of life's biggest crises: Nancy has cancer.
   She had found her own empowerment as a successful illustrator of
children's books and had reconciled with her self-absorbed husband,
Elliot. They were contemplating having another child, so she went
for a physical examination.
   The physical prompted ``a high suspicion that something might be
abnormal,'' said Dr. Maurie Markman, a medical oncologist
specializing in ovarian cancer at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center here.
   He is a frequent watcher of ABC's series, which airs on Tuesday
nights. Tonight's episode, an ABC spokesman says, continues the
story of Nancy, and the problems another character, Melissa, is
having with her father and her lover.
   In earlier episodes that led to Nancy's far greater problem,
doctors ``initially did a laparascopy _ a small incision in the
abdominal cavity,'' Markman said. They found the abnormal cells
that indicated ovarian cancer. She then underwent removal of her
uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes.
   Nancy was lucky, Markman said, because ovarian cancer has no
specific, early symptons. ``Examination won't help in this disease
at all,'' he said.
   Even though the disease was discovered at any early stage, Nancy
still faces a grueling regimen of chemotherapy. ``She certainly
needs chemotherapy and I think they're going to give it to her,''
Markman said.
   ``It's usually between five and eight to 10 months of treatment
with fairly standard drugs, associated with a fair amount of acute
side effects,'' Markman said.
   He said the severity of those side effects ary from patient, but
they include nausea, vomiting, fatigue, loss of appetite, hair
loss, potential risk of infection, bleeding, anemia and sometimes
more serious problems like kidney damage and neurological damage,
including numbness and tingling of the feet.
   Seventy to 80 percent of ovarian cancer patients are cured with
therapy, he said. In the more advanced cases, probably only 20 to
30 percent survive. And in very advanced cases, probably 10 percent
survive.
   ``Most of the time, you survive,'' Markman said. ``She doesn't
appreciate that at this point. ``What she's focusing on is that she
has got a 20 to 30 percent chance of dying, and I think that's very
accurate. That's not television.''
   Elliot, played by Tim Busfield, also is creating a true-to-life,
if not particularly likeable, character. ``He's sort of dealing
with this by being incredibly busy and almost not willing to hear
what she's saying,'' Markman said.
   ``That's exactly how I would expect a loved one to respond. With
time and with thinking about it, with discussions, you will find
out what your loved one needs. Not by ignoring the complaints and
then being reassuring,'' he said.
   Marshall Herskovitz, executive producer and co-creator with
Edward Zwick of ``thirtysomething,'' said the show's writers have
consulted with cancer specialists about the disease.
   He said Nancy has stage I(c) ovarian cancer and the side-effects
of her chemotherapy aren't expected to involve hair loss or extreme
nausea. ``Which is not to say that there aren't side effects,'' he
added. ``That is the reality.''
   ``It was always our intention to illustrate what we've seen to
be the truth of life with cancer, which is that life goes on,''
Herskovitz said.
   ``Nancy is not defined by the fact that she has cancer now, and
that's something we've not seen on television, and that seems so
much the heart of life with cancer,'' he said.
   ``Chemotherapy will become a factor in her life, a nuisance, a
burden in her life, but it will not define her life,'' he said.
   Markman is impressed with the show's handling of the cancer
theme as well as actress Patricia Wettig's portrayal of Nancy.
   ``This is not a soap opera,'' the doctor said. ``The character
herself is very good and I think she (Wettig) has done a very good
job of portraying the real feelings. She's focused on her death.''
   What Markman wants to emphasize is that there is real hope Nancy
will be cured of her cancer and live a normal life for many years.
   ``Right now, she can't think about that,'' he said. ``I'm just
hopeful that that aspect of the life of a cancer patient does not
get lost in the story line.''

   While the economic fraternity was looking for
economic clues from retail sales during the Christmas season, the
manufacturing economy was eroding right under their noses.
   Productivity was falling, layoffs growing, profits falling,
inventories accumulating, labor costs rising and production
declining. In some respects, the situation was the worst since the
last recession.
   None of this was new, however. All these indicators were
weakening throughout the year. The rate of profit growth, for
example, fell in every quarter of 1989, and it probably will fall
again in this quarter.
   Understandably, such a situation has instilled fear in
manufacturers, and they have expressed it by production slowdowns,
campaigns to reduce inventories, and a re-evaluation of plans to
expand factories.
   How could all these signs have drawn so little attention?
Because, say some analysts, consumers are the key, and everyone was
watching them. They account for 66 percent of gross national
product; they have kept the expansion going.
   The consumer, they said, is our leader.
   That might have been so, observed economists at DRI McGraw-Hill,
a statistics unit of Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., ``but now the
consumer has become a follower, not a leader of the economy.''
   In short, manufacturing slowed down to wait for the consumer and
the consumer slowed down to see what manufacturers were up to. The
economy stalled out.
   Economic silence breeds fear. Somehow, interest rates began
rising, even though everyone but Alan Greenspan, chairman of the
Federal Reserve Board, seemed to believe they should be going the
other way.
   As you might expect, the weather didn't cooperate. December was
one of the coldest on record in much of the northern United States
and even deep into the South. Utility and food bills rose. Producer
prices jumped sharply.
   Recession talk grew more ominous, and there was a good basis for
it. If prices are rising and production is slowing you have a
recipe for no growth. And no growth is just a statistical fraction
from shrinkage.
   ``Unfortunately, the fear of inflation is feeding the fear of
recession,'' the DRI McGraw-Hill analysts pointed out. And now,
nobody seems to believe in the future strongly enough to get things
moving again.
   The engine has stalled, and producers and consumers stand by
wondering what to do. Somebody has to get in the vehicle and steer,
but somebody has to push. Who will do what?
   Not I, say the consumers. We haven't the strength to push and,
frankly, we don't think it's fair for us to have to steer the
engine. We've had our splurge. We have kept the economy moving for
years and now we need a rest.
   Moreover, we have piled up too many bills; everyone tells us
that and we believe them, and now we're going to save instead.
Interest rates are rising, so it will pay to have money in savings.
   Producers, however, view their big inventories and rebel against
being in the driver's seat. And, they add, they aren't strong
enough to push. Profits of late are real poor; they say they might
even have to cut capital spending.
   Help!

   Dawn can be horrible if you've fallen asleep
with the TV on. You're apt to wake up hearing odd chants and
sayings that chill the soul.
   You will hear things like this: ``And it's one and two and three
and four.''
   Or, ``Four, three, two, and hold it.''
   Or, ``This workout's gonna be an outer-body experience.''
   All that is from ESPN's ``Bodies in Motion,'' one of nine
exercise shows for adults available on cable and over-the-air TV
here from 5:25 a.m., when ``Morning Stretch'' begins, to noon, when
ESPN emits ``Bodyshaping.'' There is also a 6:30 a.m. show for
tykes called ``Mousercise.''
   Most of the grown-up shows are in the early morning, which is
when everyone should be thinking of calling in sick. They feature
something called low-impact aerobics, a form of exercise in which
hearty men in tights and lovely women in leotards stomp in place,
wave their arms and smile, smile, smile.
   It is not good to see all this at dawn. But you can watch
exercise tapes _ those of Jane Fonda are the best-known _ at a
decent hour. A decent hour is 3 p.m. on a Saturday when you just
can't back get to sleep.
   What goes in these tapes always had been a mystery to us. But we
recently received one called ``Fitness Now,'' by Judi Sheppard
Missett, founder of a 20-year-old exercise business in Los Angeles
called ``Jazzercise.''
   Missett previously made two other tapes and in 1982 had the
first exercise album to sell more than 500,000 copies, according to
a note with the tape.
   Moving right along, now, her new tape starts with an explanation
of a ``perceived exertion method.'' It uses a chart divided into
three parts _ yellow, green and red.
   Red means you may be about to go blooie and should slow down.
   Yellow is for warmup, says Missett, with the green zone for
aerobic time. When in the green, she says, ``to maximize your
fat-burning potential, you'll need to exercise between fairly
light, to somewhat hard, and hard.''
   She introduces six fellow instructors, all as healthy-looking as
she, and the main event begins.
   We normally don't exercise, lest we croak. But we have a go at
following follow Missett's instructions, which include exhortations
to ``keep your body lined up'' and how to warm up the feet for
``fat-burning dancing.''
   The tempo of the soft-rock music increases. Arms are waved amid
her cries of encouragement, to wit: ``Yeah! And again. Hah! And
again.''
   Then individual parts of the body get a workout, including the
head, which is to be rolled around. That is the easy part. We start
fading when she moves us into the green zone part of the tape.
   ``So, put on your dancing shoes, tap your toes ... we're going
to burn some fat and we're going to have fun, right, guys?'' Her
colleagues say yes. But as the tempo goes to a brisk disco beat, we
say no.
   We hop up and down. We hear a wild scream. It is Max the cat on
whom we accidentally have hopped. Max flees. We bend about, rock
back and forth, do a ``pelvic tilt,'' raise and lower the old
knees, roll the old arms around.
   ``What are we burning, gang?'' cries Missett.
   ``Fat!'' her colleagues shout.
   We get down and boogie. We find it very hard to get back up.
After only three minutes of brisk hopping, bending and waving, we
hear sounds of things breaking _ a hamstring, an Achilles tendon, a
truss, all of it ours.
   This means we are in the red zone. We sit down. Then we lie
down, and realize there is a large untapped market out there. It is
for a tape that shows you how to lie down and stay there.

   ABC WINS AGAIN: ABC's ``World News Tonight'' last week won its
sixth consecutive week in the ratings by a hefty margin, averaging
an 11.0 rating to the 9.9 of Dan Rather's ``CBS Evening News'' and
the 9.6 of Tom Brokaw's ``NBC Nightly News.'' Each ratings point
represents 921,000 homes.
   MORE FROM SOUTH AFRICA: With Nelson Mandela now free after 27
years in a South African prison, CBS' ``48 Hours,'' as might be
expected, will devote Thursday's show to that nation and its
apartheid policy. A spokewoman for the show said it will contrast
the way whites and blacks there live.

   For all that's happening in Eastern Europe, the
Communist Party remains in firm control in Vietnam. But a visit to
the capital city of Hanoi reveals that even here capitalism has
obtained a toehold, some stringent controls have been loosened, and
Westerners are no longer looked on as ogres.

<TEXT>
   A pedicab works its way through Hanoi's
tree-lined streets, dodging a jumble of motor scooters and
bicycles, delivering a Japanese color TV to its new owner.
   It rolls past a park dominated by a bronze statue of Karl Marx,
then under a large poster depicting a heroic laborer, peasant,
soldier and scientist fighting to build socialism.
   But elsewhere along the pedicab's route, there are indications
that fledgling capitalism is taking hold in this communist capital
of Southeast Asia.
   There are the dozens of privately run cafes decorated with
colorful lights where people gather at night to chat or watch
television over a drink that may be a $1 can of Heineken beer or a
50-cent bottle of Vietnamese-brand Lua Moi vodka.
   There are shops stocked with imported tape decks and
videocassette recorders to be snatched up by the city's nouveau
riche.
   By all accounts, the Vietnamese capital has become a more
relaxed place to live as the government introduces dramatic
market-style economic reforms and eases stringent political
controls.
   Westerners who live in Hanoi or frequently visit the city say
they are amazed at how fast the changes have occurred. They note
the Vietnamese are even becoming more colorful in their dress, with
reds and pinks replacing the drab clothing of a few years ago.
   Everywhere one turns, Western influences are clearly mingling
with the traditional and socialist.
   At a recent Hanoi wedding reception, for example, a pop combo
complete with sax was on stage playing an overly audible version of
Cat Stevens' ``Wild World'' as traditional cookies and tea were
served to about 200 guests, including elderly communist officials.
   State-run television also reflects the Western influence.
   On a recent early evening program, the camera lovingly panned
along a counter of carefully arranged lean cuts of meat, the type
of propaganda programming long found in poor Marxist states. But
just a few hours later, the people of Hanoi tuned in to a flashy
Whitney Houston music video.
   Socialist author Nguyen Dinh Thi insists the party also is
giving the country's intellectuals more freedom. He said writers
now ``have the right to speak the truth,'' even though private
newspapers and magazines still are not allowed in this one-party
state.
   And while a foreigner can now visit a Hanoi friend without
causing a panic over possible repercussions, such visits are best
made at night under the cover of darkness so as not to attract too
much attention.
   But for all the changes, the party still rejects any challenge
to its monopoly on power and the economy still has a long way to
go, as Vietnam remains one of the world's poorest nations.
   Beggars accost foreigners on Hanoi's streets and inside
department stores, while families live in cramped apartments
housing up to a dozen or more people.
   On virtually every Hanoi street, dozens of young men play
billiards on roughly hewn pool tables, a sign of the serious
unemployment.
   Meanwhile, the colonial-era infrastructure of Hanoi continues to
crumble from neglect after escaping largely unscathed from the war
with the United States.
   Power outages are common and the buildings need not only a fresh
coat of paint but substantial renovation work.
   Among the structures still standing is the infamous ``Hanoi
Hilton,'' a prison that once housed American prisoners of war but
is now, officials say, home to only common criminals.
   Public transportation is limited, with only a few buses and
wheezing trolleys of ancient vintage on the potholed roads. The
major mode of transportation remains the bicycle.
   In the countryside, the rice paddies that line the main road to
the northern port of Haiphong are irrigated by hand. Bridges over
major rivers are only one lane wide but handle two-way vehicle and
rail traffic.
   On a recent weekday morning, scores of cars and trucks waited
for nearly an hour as two steam locomotives belching black smoke
laboriously chugged across one bridge.
   Vietnam is counting on the West to help in its modernization
efforts, particularly now that Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union
are preoccupied with fixing their own sputtering economies.
   Fifteen years after the end of the Vietnam War, the United
States still refuses to establish diplomatic ties with Hanoi and is
blocking Vietnamese efforts to obtain assistance from international
financial organizations.
   Despite the U.S. bombing of the north during the war, and the
continued political snubs from Washington, the people of Hanoi
appear to hold few grudges against Americans.
   That spirit was exemplified by Nguyen Thi Quy, a 66-year-old
woman who lives near Kham Thien, a Hanoi street devastated by a
1972 U.S. bombing raid.
   Quy lost her 14-year-old daughter in the attack. Every day she
lights incense at a memorial to the victims that was erected on the
site of a kindergarten destroyed in the bombing.
   The open-air memorial consists of a concrete statue of a woman
with a dead child resting on her knee. It bears the inscription:
``Deeply bear in mind hatred for the U.S. aggressors. 26-12-1972.''
Two small bunches of flowers flank the entrance.
   Quy, her long hair streaked gray and black, began to cry when
she recounted the loss of her daughter, whom she said was making
plans to travel abroad to study when the bombs fell.
   How does she feel about Americans?
   ``I hate that American plane that killed my daughter,'' she
says, ``but I don't hate the American people.''

   It was an ``All-American'' city of the 1950s, a
prospering factory town on the Hudson River 50 miles north of New
York City. Today Newburgh, N.Y., like so many other cities, has
fallen victim to drugs, crime and decay. The citizens of Newburgh,
however, are starting to fight back.

   Cops in hiding on Newburgh's East End
watch three men selling crack cocaine make a couple of quick deals.
   ``There's no business like drug business,'' sings out one of the
dealers, to the tune of the Irving Berlin show biz anthem.
   The cops move in and bust all three.
   That's Newburgh, 1990, a city of 25,000 on the Hudson River just
50 miles north of New York City, but with a worse reputation in
relation to its size.
   The Newburgh of Donald Presutti's youth was so safe, so
prosperous, so clean that in 1952 Look magazine called it the
``All-American'' city.
   The Newburgh of Donald Presutti's adulthood, the one he
administers as mayor, is an urban battleground where citizens are
trying to reclaim their streets from the drug pushers and addicts
and criminals who've made the city a dirty word in the Northeast.
   ``The fight for freedom on the American soil is being fought in
Newburgh and on the streets of cities like Newburgh,'' Presutti
says. ``If we lose this war, society as we know it today will no
longer exist. What you'll end up with is possibly what old Rome was
like, with all the villas and cities walled, and armed guards
everywhere.''
   Presutti doesn't think he is overstating the danger, and neither
do other city and civic leaders. What has happened to their city is
happening all over America, just not to such an extraordinary
degree, they say.
   ``Our commitment to the war on drugs is so great that we have
unarmed John Q. Citizens out on the street trying to intimidate
drug users and drug dealers,'' Presutti says. ``This is the first
war other than the Revolution and the Civil War that's being fought
on the street.''
   Just over 9,000 crimes were reported to police in Newburgh in
1988, the last full year for which statistics are available. The
city's crime rate of 139.5 per 1,000 in population was more than
double the statewide average and a total approaching those of
cities atop the FBI's national high-crime list.
   For a community in New York state, however, the crime index
that's always mattered most is how a city compares with New York
City.
   Newburgh has a higher murder rate than New York City, and a
higher rate of rapes and burglaries and robberies and aggravated
assaults and larcenies, according to data from the New York state
Division of Criminal Justice Services.
   A special anti-crime unit formed within the Newburgh police
department in 1985 was supposed to deal with burglary, robbery and
prostitution cases. Now, 90 percent of its work concerns
drug-related crime. The task force makes eight to 10 felony drug
arrests each week.
   People old enough to remember agree that Newburgh's slide began
in the 1960s, when manufacturing companies began to scale back
local operations in the face of foreign competition and aging
factories. Newburgh was once the biggest maker of pocketbooks in
the nation, once a thriving fabrics and garment center, once a busy
bottler of beverages and maker of furniture.
   The bottom fell out in the 1970s.
   ``I would say that Newburgh in a lot of ways epitomized the
problems that the entire Northeast experienced,'' says Chris
Dunleavy, executive director of the Orange County Chamber of
Commerce. ``The manufacturing base moved off, to the South and
offshore. Many workers who had moved in from the South, from Puerto
Rico and Latin America _ people who were basically unskilled _
remained.''
   The city's medium household income is $10,923, far less than the
$18,012 average for Orange County as a whole. Unemployment in the
city runs at about 8 percent, compared to the statewide average of
about 5 percent.
   Newburgh's location on the Hudson River was once an ideal place
for a manufacturing center to distribute its goods. Later, the city
benefited from being at the intersection of two major interstate
highways, the north-south New York State Thruway and the east-west
Interstate 84.
   Now, police say the city has become a crossroads for drug
traffic between New York City, upstate New York and New England.
Authorities say local dealers have ties to cocaine distribution
networks based as far away as Miami.
   Many dealers have set up business in Newburgh to escape the
cutthroat drug trade in New York City. Police say the drug buyers
range from Newburgh's own poor to affluent businessmen and college
students.
   Buyers also come from as far away as Albany, New Jersey and
Pennsylvania, according to Newburgh Police Capt. Santo Centamore.
   State Social Services Commissioner Cesar Perales said after a
recent tour of Newburgh that the most blighted parts of the city
are comparable to the notorious South Bronx in New York City.
   A citizens' group called the Newburgh Drug and Alcohol Task
Force has tried for a year to mount a grass-roots campaign against
drugs.
   The group has staged rallies on Lander Street and other
notorious drug haunts, where members marched with signs and chanted
anti-drug slogans in demonstrations they dubbed ``One Block At A
Time.'' It has organized rallies in local schools and lobbied with
state officials for special anti-drug aid.
   Among the most visibile anti-drug activists are Joan Shapiro, a
former mayor of Newburgh, and her husband, Jerry. While in office,
during the mid-1980s, she regularly cruised the streets at night in
search of her son, a cocaine addict who eventually was sent to a
drug treatment center and has been ``clean and serene'' for more
than three years.
   In late September, Gov. Mario Cuomo declared that Newburgh would
be the only area outside New York City to be included in an
experimental state program to fight drugs through a combination of
stepped-up enforcement, better treatment programs and improved
education.
   As Cuomo was announcing Newburgh's designation at a local
school, a woman was arrested on nearby Lander Street for crack
possession.
   She was wearing a ``Stop Crack'' button.

   A Scottish disc jockey has found a wide audience
playing her own brand of down-home music on public radio in, of all
places, North Carolina. But why not? Most of this area's original
settlers were Scotch-Irish immigrants who brought their fiddles and
tin whistles to harken back to the music of their homeland.

   ``I obviously sound like where this music
comes from,'' she says in her lilting, rich Scottish brogue.
   And listening to Fiona Ritchie from her forum, ``Thistle &amp;
Shamrock'' on public radio, it sounds like she is surrounded by
musicians from Scotland, Ireland, Wales and Brittany.
   She's a Scottish disc jockey with a weekly hour-long show
originating in North Carolina.
   Unlikely? Why not?
   Some of this area's original settlers were Scotch-Irish
immigrants who sought to imitate the music of their homeland with
fiddles and tin whistles.
   Fiona's radio show has attracted a wide and faithful audience
from Maine to California.
   Even she had to chuckle when she found her name in The Boston
Globe's crossword puzzle.
   The clue was, ``Public radio's Ritchie.''
   Ritchie, a youthful 29-year-old with thick auburn hair, says she
has had no formal training in music or radio. Yet over the last six
years, she has evolved into one of American Public Radio's biggest
draws.
   It is now picked up by 165 public radio stations across the
country.
   ``It's still popular and growing,'' she said in an interview at
her studio at WFAE-FM, just before leaving for a working vacation
at her parent's home in Greenock, Scotland. ``If it weren't, I
might graciously bow out.''
   That's the last thing her fans, many of whom write her letters
and subscribe to her newsletter, want Ritchie to do.
   ```Thistle &amp; Shamrock' is the reason God invented ears,'' wrote
one fan from Laramie, Wyo.
   ``I work as a ranger deep in the woods of northern Maine for
half the year, and every Saturday night at 8 p.m. finds me glued to
the radio for `The Thistle &amp; Shamrock,''' wrote another fan. ``Your
show has opened a whole new world of music and musical instruments
to me.''
   Ritchie launched the Celtic music show in 1981 as a local radio
show in Charlotte, where she had spent a year in college as an
exchange student from Stirling University in Scotland. Two years
later, APR syndicated it nationally.
   The name of the show came out of her imagination.
   ``It's my own concoction,'' says Ritchie, her face breaking into
a big smile. ``I wanted a name that would evoke a place where this
music would be performed _ a pub-like setting.''
   There's a style she brings to her weekly show that's all Fiona
Ritchie.
   One week the theme could be songs of the sea. The next, songs
about the working class. Later, music from a particular region of
Ireland or England could be featured. Ritchie gives her listeners a
brief preview before each set.
   ``The appeal of the show lies directly with Fiona,'' says APR
spokeswoman Deborah Wolfer in a telephone interview from St. Paul,
Minn. ``Her personality is engaging and her fans sense her
enthusiasm for the subject. People listen for her, not just the
music.''
   To Ritchie, the real attraction is the music, some of it
hundreds of years old. While she started off as an amateur, her
small office is now crammed with tapes, Celtic records and music
reference books.
   ``I'm always looking for new music,'' she says. ``I'll be
bringing some recordings and CDs back with me from Scotland. But I
even find some of it here in Charlotte.''
   Ritchie's playlist ranges from the traditional Scottish ballads
of Jean Redpath, including ``The Songs of Robert Burns,'' to the
Irish traditional music of De Danann and, of course, The Chieftains
(``In Ireland'').
   Another Ritchie favorite is the Battlefield Band, which plays
music based on traditional Scottish tunes.
   Dougie MacLean, who toured with Ritchie last year, also is a
popular attraction. He's a Scottish songwriter who writes new music
in traditional arrangements.
   You also could hear the contemporary offerings of Nightnoise,
including cuts from ``Something of Time'' and ``At the End of the
Evening.''
   ``When I first moved here I had no idea there was such a
connection between the area and Scotland,'' Ritchie says. ``I
didn't expect the people to take such an interest in the music.''
   To Ritchie, the music's appeal transcends most of life's
differences _ including age, national origin and economic class.
   ``People enjoy music that's emotional,'' she says. ``This music
is loaded with emotions.''
   Her fans come from all ethnic backgrounds, not just those with
an Irish or Scottish heritage. ``This music ... has something
everyone can enjoy.''
   Her own tastes run from traditional Celtic music to jazz and
classical and on to contemporary artists like U2, Van Morrison and
Nancy Griffith.
   Ritchie can be spotted at concerts across the country taping
live shows for later play on the ``Thistle &amp; Shamrock.''
   Last March, Ritchie took the ``Thistle &amp; Shamrock'' on the road.
Six Scottish musicians, headed by fiddler Dougie MacLean, played
sellout concerts in 10 U.S. cities. The second annual tour will
begin in September.

   Actress Valerie Harper, who plays a city
manager in her new CBS comedy series, knows how to fight city hall.
   After she was fired in August 1987 from NBC's ``Valerie,'' since
retitled ``The Hogan Family,'' she took the producers, Lorimar
Studios and the network to court. She not only fought, she won,
getting a settlement of $1.4 million for lost wages. Her husband
and the co-executive producer, Tony Cacciotti, also received a
substantial settlement.
   In the series ``City,'' Harper plays City Manager Liz Gianni,
who copes with hectic conditions at work and with a nubile teen-age
daughter demanding more freedom at home.
   Harper, probably best remembered as the irrepressible Rhoda
Morgenstern of ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' and ``Rhoda,'' also
will be seen Tuesday in the CBS movie ``Stolen: One Husband.'' She
stars as a wife who loses her husband of 25 years, played by
Elliott Gould, and sets out to get him back.
   While still in court over ``Valerie,'' Harper became actively
involved in developing ``City.'' In January, Jeff Sagansky, the new
president of CBS Entertainment and former subordinate of NBC's
Brandon Tartikoff, pulled the faltering ``The Famous Teddy Z'' and
rushed ``City'' into its Monday time slot.
   That puts ``City'' directly opposite ``The Hogan Family.'' In
the ratings for the premiere episode Harper knocked the socks off
her former family. Which, in a sense, is biting the hand that feeds
her. The court awarded her a profit participation in her old show
that could yield $15 million.
   ``I don't think placing it against my former show was
deliberate,'' she says. ``It was deliberate to put me in that
Monday comedy block. I think Jeff Sagansky was looking for
something fresh and singular and honest to replace `Teddy Z.' But
going against `The Hogan Family' was happenstance.
   ``I certainly didn't want to go against `The Cosby Show' on
Thursday at 8 o'clock. I didn't want to go head-to-head against
`Roseanne.' Roseanne Barr sent me two dozen roses the day after I
started work. We're both at the MTM Studios.
   ``We'd met at the `Comedy Awards Show' when I was still in
court. She said someone had told her not to get pushy, to remember
the lesson of Valerie Harper. She said to me, `I hope you teach
them a lesson.'''
   Harper believes her court victory has indeed sent a clear
message to Hollywood. It showed, she says, that she had not walked
off the show in a display of temper or behaved erratically, as
Lorimar had alleged, but had been wrongfully discharged.
   After ``Valerie,'' Harper was first involved in a show called
``Desperate Women.'' The comedy, created by Paul Haggis, was about
a family of Italian women in Brooklyn.
   ``CBS said, `We liked the show before but we don't like it now,'
'' says Harper. ``I don't know what they didn't like about it.
Probably that I was in a domestic situation the way I was in
`Valerie.' I had a deal with CBS for a show and we started over
again. There was no way I was going to go ahead without Paul
Haggis. I wasn't sure he'd want to start over again from scratch.
   ``Tony knew that Paul had a treatment for an hour show called
`City' that was like `L.A. Law.' Tony suggested making it a
half-hour. Paul said it was too heavy, but he came back after a
weekend and said OK. The original show was intended for a woman.''
   The city in ``City'' is never identified. It's a large city,
about the size of Cleveland or Pittsburgh, and is in the snow belt.
A broken sign in the show that says ``City of--'' expresses
conditions and attitudes at city hall that Liz is trying to correct.
   Harper's character is Italian. She calls herself Italian by
association.
   ``My stepmother Angela is n Italian from New York City,'' she
says. ``I based Rhoda on her and a Jewish friend named Penny Ann
Green. People often said that Rhoda seemed to be Italian. That was
the Angela seeping through.
   ``Liz is a person who has to handle a budget and deliver what
the politicians promise. She has to see that the police and fire
departments run and that the garbage is collected. She has a
passion that sometimes gets her into trouble. Her daughter, Penny,
is the apple of her eye, but their temperaments are entirely
different. There's a lot of give and take between us.''
   Harper says she sees no resemblance between Liz and Rhoda. Liz
is a woman with a lot of ability who knows how to get things done.
She sees Liz as closer to the role she played in ``Farrell for the
People,'' a 1982 movie pilot in which she played a prosecuting
attorney.

   When you're an aspiring musical comedy performer
and can't get jobs because you look as if you're 12 but sing like
Alfred Drake, where do you go?
   The precarious world of cabaret offers opportunity, if not
steady employment. The latter might be a possibility now for Jeff
Harnar, a 30-year-old, baby-faced baritone who has gathered rave
reviews since the debut last July of ``Carried Away,'' his show
celebrating the lyrics of Betty Comden and Adolph Green.
   New York critics tossed superlatives, comparing him to cabaret
performer-turned-superstar Michael Feinstein. They called Harnar's
innovative evening of songs _ done at two different nightspots
around town _ one of the best of the year.
   The object of their admiration is an unassuming young man who
has struggled for more than a decade to make a name for himself in
music. It has been an effort.
   Harnar arrived in New York in 1979 from various points west. He
grew up in a lot of cities where his father worked for Ford Motor
Co. It was in Dearborn, Mich., at age 5, that Harnar discovered
musicals. A neighbor was doing a community theater production of
``How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying'' and took him
to see it.
   ``The whole thing _ the music, seeing someone I knew on stage,
the sets, the costumes and knowing, even at that age, that the show
had a part in it I would like to do _ just came together,'' Harnar
says. He was hooked on theater.
   Harnar nurtured that ambition in high school in Winnetka, Ill.,
at a school where musicals, he says, were treated with respect.
   When he finally got to New York in 1979, it was a different
story. Musicals weren't the same. Brash Broadway musical comedy had
given way to big British spectacle.
   `I was typed as a juvenile in auditions,'' he says, ``and then
I'd sing with a baritone voice. Most of the roles were for tenors,
juvenile tenors. I was never cast, and I took that very much to
heart.''
   In 1983, as his last hurrah in show biz, Harnar put together an
act for a one-night run at a small club. Out of it came a two-week
booking.
   ``But I had such a miserable time that I figured, `That's it. I
don't know what I'm going to do with this career,''' he recalls.
   What he did was put it on hold. He went to work as a houseboy
for Phyllis McGuire of the McGuire Sisters. For three years, he
didn't sing or go to the theater. ``I was very depressed,'' he says.
   But the job proved to be an opportunity to observe his employer
in a similar situation.
   ``She was launching a comeback, and I was watching her go
through the exact same things that I was going through as a
newcomer. The scope of it was a lot grander, but she had to prove
herself again to get back in the door in Las Vegas. It inspired me,
probably even more than I realized.
   ``It was through the course of that job that I realized that
it's not so much the talent. There comes a point where your talent
is the given. It's more happenstance _ the opportunities, the
persistence, the perseverance.''
   By 1987, Harnar was ready to try again. He eventually found a
home at Eighty-Eight's, a Greenwich Village nightclub. He was able
to change and hone his act there, finding out what was viable in
front of an audience. To support himself between engagements, he
took a job as a singing waiter at a West Side restaurant.
   The evening of Comden and Green songs was born last April. But
the songwriting team, responsible for the lyrics for such shows as
``On the Town,'' ``Bells Are Ringing,'' ``Wonderful Town,'' ``Do Re
Mi'' and others, was not easy to persuade at first.
   Harnar, his pianist, Alex Rybeck, and his director, Sara Louise
Lazarus, researched material from all the Comden and Green stage
and film musicals. But when the singer called them to get approval,
he found the team wanting to discourage the project.
   Harnar kept talking, turning the tide when he told them he was
thinking of singing ``Never Never Land'' from ``Peter Pan'' as a
doo-wop number. That got a laugh out of Green as well as the team's
OK.
   The title of the show, ``Carried Away,'' a song from ``On the
Town,'' also is its theme. In it, Harnar sings Comden and Green
patter songs as examples of getting excessive about life and love.
   For his next cabaret effort, Harnar and friends plan to salute a
theatrical year. He picked 1959 because that's the year he was born
and because he's hooked on the '50s. There's plenty of material.
Among the shows that opened on Broadway in 1959 were ``Gypsy,''
``The Sound of Music,'' ``Fiorello,'' ``Take Me Along,''
``Redhead'' and ``Destry Rides Again,'' as well as such interesting
flops as ``Juno'' and ``Saratoga.'' The list of composers includes
Richard Rodgers, Jule Styne, Jerry Bock, Marc Blitzstein, Harold
Rome and Harold Arlen.
   ``When you put together a club act, it's entirely your favorite
songs. It's exactly what I want to be singing. When that gets
received well, that's the most rewarding experience I can
imagine,'' he says.
   ``Now my peers come up to me and say, `When are you going to get
over this cabaret thing and get back to pounding the boards
auditioning?' I am auditioning. When auditions come along that I'm
right for, I go to them. But the fact of the matter is, I'm so
happy doing what I'm doing.''

<HEAD>Eastern Europe's Upheaval Rattles Mideast Rulers</HEAD>

   Small but potentially significant moves
toward more representative government are touching much of the Arab
world, where monarchs, emirs, presidents or ruling parties have
long held overwhelming power.
   The overall balance has hardly shifted toward popular rule,
however. Parliamentary democracy as it is known in the West, with
government answerable to an elected legislature, has never taken
firm root in the Arab world despite a number of experiments.
   While some nations now are experimenting with secular
parliaments and national assemblies, it is possible that new
regimes in some countries could ultimately be shaped as much by
Islamic traditions as by Western democratic principles. And
developments in Eastern Europe, where centralized political and
economic systems are being painfully rebuilt, could also have their
effect.
   Liberalizations have been touching individual Arab nations for
at least a year, with rulers in many cases being careful to
strictly limit the new openings.
   Some Arab commentators, however, say leaders need to move faster
with concessions to popular representation before increasingly
educated citizens, disgruntled by economic problems and strict
political control, launch revolutions of their own. The fall of
Eastern Europe's dictators, like Romania's Nicolae Ceausescu,
touched off additional comment in the Arab world.
   ``There's an Arab saying: When your neighbor shaves, you should
wet your beard,'' publisher Ahmed Jarallah wrote in Kuwait's
Al-Seyassah daily.
   ``After what happened in Romania, many should prepare their
beards for shaving as the people will not forgive them. There are
regimes in the Middle East which destroyed their peoples and their
economic resources.''
   But while there are comparisons between some Arab nations and
Eastern Europe _ powerful elites, pervasive security networks and
burgeoning economic problems _ there also are significant
differences.
   The Arab drive toward reform, pre-dating the upheaval in Eastern
Europe, stemmed in large part from the spread of Islamic
fundamentalism that is anathema to all Arab governments.
   The demand for political systems based on Islamic principles has
considerable support, particularly in countries like Egypt, Jordan
and Tunisia. Arab leaders have largely tolerated this but have
sought to defuse it with limited reforms.
   Some analysts believe the most dramatic changes could occur in
two of the most repressive regimes in the Arab world, Syria and
Iraq, which are ruled by minority elites.
   Both have been heavily dependent on the Soviets, and reforms in
Eastern Europe will, many believe, force them to change their
policies.
   One nation to experiment with substantial liberalization has
been Jordan. Bloody price riots last April highlighted widespread
popular frustration and prodded King Hussein into restoring
Parliament and overseeing the first elections since 1967. They were
among the freest in the region in years.
   Hussein's government also announced it would lift martial law,
free political prisoners, legalize political parties, denationalize
the press and fight corruption.
   Yet as in other countries, the reforms do not go all the way
toward putting power in the people's hands. Hussein still can
invoke emergency powers and dissolve Parliament. Other Arab
leaders, such as Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein, also retain sweeping powers and are not
elected by popular vote.
   In prosperous Kuwait, citizens are demanding the restoration of
Parliament, which was dissolved in 1986 at the height of the
Iran-Iraq war after deputies harshly criticized authorities.
   Kuwait's ruling family has announced it is considering lifting
censorship and introducing unspecified democratic changes. But the
emir has refused to receive a petition signed by 25,000 citizens
demanding the convening of Parliament.
   Salem al-Marzouk, a former member of Parliament who is agitating
for its return, said that since it was dissolved, corruption and
economic abuses in the emirate have been ``rampant.''
   ``One cannot say that Parliament could solve the problems, but
it could raise the issue and pressure the government to do
something about it,'' he said.
   In Algeria, once a bastion of autocratic Third World radicalism,
President Chadli Bendjedid has allowed the creation of poplitical
parties, freed the press and introduced private enterprise
corporations.
   Following riots that left 176 people dead by official count, he
brought in a new constitution for ``more democracy, to assure
public and individual liberties and establish the sovereignty of
law.''
   Local elections are due this spring, with the ruling National
Liberation Front competing as one of many parties.
   In neighboring Tunisia, President Zine el Abidine ben Ali
promised to bring ``true democracy'' to his North African country
when he ousted aging Habib Bourguiba in 1987. But in the first
elections, held in April last year, the ruling Democratic
Constitutional Rally won all 141 seats in the National Assembly,
leading the opposition to cry foul.
   South Yemen is opening the doors to a multiparty system, easing
travel restrictions and improving its relations with Western
countries.
   The leadership there is a coalition of the ruling Yemeni
Socialist Party and various tribal factions, reflecting the uneasy
duality of Western and traditional concepts found in many Arab
countries.
   As the Arab world's only avowedly Marxist state and a close ally
of Moscow, South Yemen has felt the repercussions of Soviet
perestroika more acutely than other countries in the region.
   Elsewhere, Sultan Qaboos of the Persian Gulf nation of Oman
reportedly is considering reforms that include elected local
councils in line with the traditions of the ruling Ibadi sect,
which has highly developed principles of elected leadership and
representative government.
   Saudi Arabia's ruling family has considered setting up a
consultative council and even built an ornate building to house it,
but it has shelved the project amid conservative opposition in the
theocratic kingdom.
   There are few signs of any democratic opening in Syria,
dominated by President Hafez Assad, who seized power in 1970, and
his pervasive military apparatus. But there are no signs of
upheaval either, despite severe economic problems.
   Nor is there sign of sweeping change in neighboring Iraq, ruled
by strongman Saddam Hussein, despite experiments such as allowing
elections and waging periodic anti-corruption drives.
   Saddam recently announced that a new constitution, to be
approved by referendum, would provide for a free press and the
formation of new political parties but no details were given.

   Selling travel documents and smuggling aliens
have become gold mines in Asia, with government officials and
middlemen making fortunes creating new identities for thousands of
people.
   Paying up to $30,000 apiece, thousands of Asians are leaving
their continent and hoping for a better life. Most want to go to
North America. Some enter a life of crime along the way.
   ``Alien smuggling is the crime of the '90s,'' said Mark D.
Riordan, a Hong Kong-based special agent of the U.S. Immigration
and Naturalization Service. ``It's almost as lucrative as drugs but
the penalties and dangers are minimal.''
   The latest rage involves a complex paper trail where legitimate
travel agents in Hong Kong pay large fees for real passports and
visas and then sell them to their clients. But it's also done
traditionally by faking visas and smuggling travellers across
borders at night.
   Diplomats and travel agents say officials from Latin American
countries have sold thousands of genuine travel documents to
Chinese fleeing the communist regime. Bolivia recently removed
several China-based diplomats after allegations of trading travel
documents for sex and money. In December, the consul general for
Panama in Hong Kong submitted his resignation after allegations
that his consulate sold up to 7,000 visas to Chinese.
   On the traditional end, counterfeit rings are pumping out
thousands of bogus travel documents to people from Thailand,
Malaya, Pakistan, the Philippines, Taiwan and Hong Kong.
   Currently, the biggest market for travel documents is China,
where businessmen and the children of important officials are
fleeing the increasingly hardline state. Another is Hong Kong,
which comes under Communist Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
   A 1989 U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service report
identified ``an elaborate and intricate smuggling pipeline'' used
by people from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan to get into the United
States.
   ``This illegal traffic is noticeably on the increase,'' it said.
   Most of the travellers want to go to North America, businessmen
and immigration officials say. But immigrating there legally is
difficult. Without a relative in the United States, most people
have little chance of becoming Americans. Canada has strict
residency requirements.
   One way people leave Asia is to first obtain Latin American
travel documents and then head to South America by way of the
United States or Canada, entering North America under a category
called ``transit without visa.''
   Arriving in North America, the immigrants attempt to sneak out
of airports. Failing that, they continue to Latin America where
they try to enter North America from the south.
   Prices for a genuine visa or passport from Latin America range
between $6,000 and $30,000, U.S. businessmen say. The large fees
often mean people borrow huge sums of money from crime syndicates
in exchange for years of service, diplomats say.
   In New York City, Chinese criminal organizations have been
paying an average of $30,000 for men from Fujian province in
southern China to be smuggled into the United States as
``indentured servants'' in the gangs, the INS report said.
   ``They have to commit crimes to pay back their sponsor,'' said
one Western law enforcement source. ``The more violent the crime,
the more money it's worth.''
   Law enforcement agents say there is little they can do to stop
the trade. First time smugglers in the United States and Canada are
rarely jailed and profits appear immense.
   A Chinese woman, Cheng Chui-peng, who faces alien smuggling
charges in Buffalo, N.Y., made tens of millions of dollars in the
trade, the INS alleges.
   Hong Kong travel agent John Choi estimates the industry has made
roughly $140 million in the past year moving people out of China.
   ``The Chinese are desperate,'' said Jean Chong, another travel
agent who claims he has sold scores of genuine Ecuadorian passports
to Chinese nationals. ``All they want to do is leave.''
   To get Chinese out of China, businessmen in Hong Kong say they
buy visas and passports from Argentina, Bolivia, Ecuador, Paraguay
and Thailand. Panama, which once topped the list for document
sales, saw its popularity plummet after the U.S. invasion in
December.
   As the Chinese government does not routinely issue passports to
its people, the travel agents often buy those from corrupt police
or local officials. The going price is about $2,500.
   Diplomats from Latin American countries generally deny that
their countries sell travel documents.
   Carlos Pimentel, the consul general of Brazil in Hong Kong, said
Brazilian officials in Asia do not sell travel documents. He said
any such documents were forgeries.
   A spokesman for the Argentine Embassy in Beijing said he was
``fairly sure that every visa'' granted by the embassy was legal.
   But Western diplomats, who have seen examples from several Latin
American countries, said many of the documents appear genuine.
   One country, Bolivia, has acknowledged the sales.
   Bolivian diplomats were improperly issuing thousands of visas in
China until the middle of last year, said Oscar Siles, Bolivia's
new consul general in Hong Kong. Some were being exchanged for sex
and others for money, diplomats said. The illegal practice was
halted after several diplomats were fired, Siles said.
   Businessmen claim the biggest single outlet for visas for
Chinese nationals was the Panamanian Consulate in Hong Kong, which,
according to Hong Kong immigration records obtained by The
Associated Press, issued about 7,000 last year.
   The consulate was run by Ciro Noriega, the cousin of deposed
Panamanian leader Manuel A. Noriega, but he has submitted his
resignation. A Panamanian trade official, Martin Palacios, said
that any illegal activity occurred in Panama and not in Hong Kong.
   South Korea has been a recent popular destination for Chinese
and other Asians, even though Beijing has no official relations
with the South Korean government. Hong Kong immigration records
show that more than 700 Chinese a month for the past six months
have passed through Hong Kong to Seoul, South Korea's capital.
   Many Chinese and other Asians stay in Seoul only long enough to
change flights, travel agents in the field say. In the airport's
transit lounge, the travellers meet couriers who supply them with
plane tickets and new travel documents, they say.
   Bogus documents are generally less expensive than genuine, but
immigration authorities worry that that may change as
counterfeiting techniques improve.
   The Hong Kong government recently cracked a counterfeiting ring
for visas to the U.S. Trust Territory of Saipan, along with U.S.
``green cards.''
   Immigration officials say many of the counterfeit passports are
produced by forgers in the Philippines. Taiwan also possesses an
active industry.
   Said one agent about the quality of recently seized fakes: ``If
this is the type of stuff they're coming up with, we're sunk.''

   With a little patience and a lot of cash, Mr.
Zhang escaped China.
   A $2,500 bribe bought him a Chinese passport. An additional
$6,000 bought him what he said was a genuine Brazilian visa and a
plane ticket to South America. With some luck and $8,000 more, he
says, he'll have a real Brazilian passport in a month.
   He arrived in Hong Kong on Feb. 3. As he paced his Hong Kong
hotel room shortly before he left for Brazil, Zhang said he was
glad to be out of China. A suitcase of U.S. dollars stood by his
bed.
   ``I'm a businessman,'' said Zhang, who spoke on condition that
his whole name not be used. ``My nationality got in the way of my
work.''
   Zhang said he hopes to go to the United States and also return
to China as a ``foreigner.'' Holders of foreign passports in China
have access to better hotels and other facilities usually off
limits to average Chinese.
   With access to large amounts of foreign exchange through his
work as a top official in an import-export company, Zhang said, he
``borrowed'' the necessary funds from his company.
   Hong Kong-based businesses say corrupt agents of the Chinese
Public Security Bureau sell Chinese passports for $2,500 each.
   Mr. Zhang said that is how he got his passport.
   Agents representing a Hong Kong-based travel agency supplied a
Chinese police officer with two of Zhang's photographs, his birth
date and $2,500, he said.
   ``In 20 days I had my document,'' said Zhang, slapping his red
Chinese passport.
   Zhang explained he couldn't get a passport on his own because
authorities had been investigating his company for tax evasion.
   ``We were too successful,'' he said with a laugh.
   Zhang, however, may have to change his plans to return to China
as a priveleged ``foreigner.''
   A recent issue of the overseas edition of official Chinese
newspaper People's Daily reported that Chinese were buying
passports for high prices in Hong Kong and Macao. It announced that
holders of such second passports could face prosecution.

   For almost half a century, being prepared for
World War III has been the military's mission and a piston driving
the American economy.
   Moscow and Washington, East and West, stood toe-to-toe along the
Iron Curtain. It took a million soldiers, 12,000 strategic nuclear
warheads and a growing defense budget to keep the peace in Europe.
   Inside a year, the world changed.
   ``For eons we've been saying, `The Russians are coming, the
Russians are coming,''' says Rep. Ronald Dellums, D-Calif. ``Well
they haven't come, and they aren't coming.'' Defense Secretary
Richard Cheney told Congress: ``We are now on the verge of winning
one of the greatest victories in the history of the world without a
shot ever being fired.''
   Three arms treaties are being negotiated for the signatures of
Presidents Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Once they are settled _
reducing the stockpiles of chemical weapons, conventional forces in
Europe and long-range nuclear missiles _ the American military will
be transformed in size and purpose.
   Yet with the outbreak of peace, as Gov. Richard Celeste of Ohio
notes, ``there can be a dark side.''
   Peace is not a completely comforting prospect for everyone:
   _Not for the 1,600 people who work in St. Louis at the Army
Troop Support Command, distributor of uniforms, tents and other
military supplies. The Pentagon wants to close it.
   _Not for the 101,000 who work for General Dynamics Corp., maker
of tanks, submarines, jets and missiles in plants from Florida to
California.
   The No. 2 defense contractor has become a symbol of the
end-of-the-Cold War malady. Public relations executive Chris
Schildz discourages reporters seeking interviews on how the company
is going to handle it.
   _Not for thousands upon thousands of GIs who now must confront
something that American soldiers don't usually worry about _ job
security.
   Today's troops aren't draftees like those let go after World War
II or the Korean War or Vietnam. They are volunteers. Many chose
the service as a career. Demobilization, for them, is as rude a
slap as a layoff for a factory worker.
   ``We are very well aware of the fact that this is the first time
the United States of America has ever taken apart an army made up
of all volunteers,'' says Lt. Gen. Gordon R. Sullivan, the Army's
deputy chief of staff for operations and plans. He says it's too
early to estimate how many soldiers will be let go.
   _Not for the 13,000 people in and around Lima, Ohio, who owe
their jobs to the Army Tank Plant. It makes the M-1 Abrams tank, a
60-ton monster deemed too muscular for the lighter, more mobile
Army the Pentagon envisions for the 1990s. The plant is scheduled
to close in 1993.
   Don Downhour, a Lima resident who doesn't work at the plant,
says he's sympathetic to the plight of the tank builders, but he
sees another side. ``We don't need tanks if we're going to have
peace,'' he muses. ``And that's what we've been praying for.''
   Harry O'Brien, shop steward at the Saco Defense plant in Saco,
Maine, whose mainstay is the Mk-19 grenade launcher, says his
co-workers are worried by the defense cutbacks. ``Everybody is
saying, `Gee, what happens if we get closed down?','' he says
   The diminishing of the 45-year-old threat of global war between
the two superpowers is worrisome in other places, too:
   _In President Bush's White House. No sooner had Bush submitted
his budget to Congress, calling for a slight drop in Pentagon
spending next year, than he took to the road to sell Americans on a
single idea: Cutting back too fast, too far is dangerous folly.
   _At the Pentagon, where Cheney has been carrying the Bush
message to Capitol Hill. He is a man in the middle _ knowing
reductions will be forced by Congress, but needing to protect
Bush's cautious approach and the strategic concerns of the armed
forces.
   _In Congress, where claimants for the ``peace dividend'' _ those
who want to retire some national debt; or cut Social Security
taxes; or address the problems of the homeless and ill-housed,
hungry and poor; or repair decaying bridges, roads and sewage
systems; or fix America's education system; or ease the
medical-cost burden of the elderly _ are lining up for a piece of
the pie. A pie that Bush says doesn't exist.
   _And again in Congress, where some foresee severe economic
upheavals if defense plants and bases close suddenly and thousands
of workers are left in the cold.
   The trouble, then, is figuring out just how much defense to
drop, and where.
   If the Cold War is over, what is the justification for spending
25 cents of every federal dollar on defense _ half of which goes to
deterring a Soviet invasion of Europe now deemed less likely than a
blue moon?
   From the fall of the Berlin Wall in November to the Soviet
Communist Party's historic decision Feb. 7 to give up its power
monopoly, events in the East bloc have eroded the very
underpinnings of Western strategic thinking. Indeed, the East
European states no longer are a ``bloc'' in the traditional sense.
   In this new world order, what will the United States do with its
military might? Fight terrorists? Play ``policeman'' in Third World
hot spots? Revert to the isolationism so dreaded by U.S. allies in
Europe and Asia?
   One answer may be in joining the Bush administration's war on
drugs, and the president is pressing for more money to use Marines
and other military resources to help keep drugs out of the country.
For years the Pentagon fought the idea, arguing it would sap
readiness to fight conventional wars and involve soldiers in police
work, customarily a civilian concern. Those misgivings seem to have
diminished.
   The exact features of the military transformation are not yet
clear, but some signs are visible. U.S. troop strength is being
cut, bases closed, weapon programs illed and security threats
reassessed.
   Less clear is what these changes will mean for individual
soldiers and their families, for communities and companies that
depend on a thriving military-industrial complex, and for a NATO
alliance facing possible disintegration.
   Bush says he hopes attrition will reduce the ranks of the
military so that relatively few soldiers will have to be discharged.
   ``I would like to think that a kid that went in to make a career
out of this would not be unceremoniously dumped from the armed
services,'' he told reporters recently.
   As Pentagon planners redefine the military's mission,
politicians are rushing to reset the nation's spending priorities.
They see a new hope for social programs that took second place to
the 1980s military buildup.
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., has proposed carving out a $169
billion ``peace dividend'' over the next five years _ more than
quadruple the savings proposed by Bush in the same period. Rep.
Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., accuses Bush of ``beating plowshares into
swords.''

   The focus on defense savings also has opened an opportunity for
supporters of ``conversion'' legislation intended to ease the
economy's transition from military to civilian endeavors.
   A bill sponsored by Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., would require
defense contractors to set aside 1.25 percent of revenues to pay
for economic adjustment. Laid-off workers might get 90 percent of
their wages while being retrained to make civilian products.
   ``Maybe it's about time to redirect some of that money that has
been used for national security to the security of people who live
in cities across our country,'' Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn said
recently.
   The Bush administration cautions against hopes for a peace
payout. It says big savings on defense should not come until new
arms controls deals are struck, the pro-democracy movements in
Eastern Europe take firmer root and more doubts are erased about
the future of Gorbachev.
   Cheney told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Feb. 1 that
hasty moves to disarm could jeopardize a peaceful conclusion to the
Cold War. He also cautioned that while Gorbachev has shown a will
to reduce Soviet conventional forces in Europe, Moscow is
modernizing its nuclear missiles capable of reaching U.S. soil.
   In his proposed 1991 budget presented to Congress Jan. 29, Bush
set Pentagon spending at $292 billion for the fiscal year that
starts Oct. 1. That's a nominal increase from the $287 billion to
be spent in the current budget year, but is a 2 percent decline
after the effect of inflation.
   Bush foresees similar cuts in each of the next several years,
but critics say the pace is far too slow in light of the
extraordinary political turnabout in Eastern Europe, where the
Warsaw Pact has fractured and at least two Pact members _ Hungary
and Czechoslovakia _ are demanding Soviet troop withdrawals.
   William Kaufmann, a defense analyst at the Brookings Institution
think tank and a frequent consultant to the Pentagon, says the
defense budget could be halved over the next nine years without
risk to national security.
   Others counsel more caution.
   ``We shouldn't be so euphoric about the prospects for peace,''
says James Blackwell, a defense specialist at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies. Of the Soviet threat, he says:
``It's different, but it's not gone.''
   Much of the heat on Bush's defense spending priorities comes
from critics who say the president is putting money in the wrong
places. For example his budget proposal seeks more than $18 billion
for weapons targeting Warsaw Pact forces, according to Congress'
bipartisan Arms Control and Foreign Policy Caucus. That is an
increase of more than $1 billion from the current budget.
   ``We shouldn't pour billions into new weapons systems designed
to counter Warsaw Pact forces that no longer exist,'' said Rep.
Howard L. Berman, D-Calif., chairman of the caucus.
   The percentage of Americans who want defense cuts is growing,
although it's still a minority. A New York Times-CBS News poll
conducted in mid-January said 36 percent of those surveyed favored
a decrease in military spending, 48 percent said it should stay the
same and 13 percent said it should be raised. A year earlier, 24
percent said it should be cut, 58 percent wanted it the same and 13
percent wanted an increase.
   Of Bush's ``big-ticket'' weapons projects, the chief candidates
for congressional slashing are the Strategic Defense Initiative, or
Star Wars project, to develop a space-based shield against
ballistic missiles, and two new long-range missiles, the mobile MX
and the smaller Midgetman.
   Bush requested an increase of $900 million, to $4.8 billion, for
Star Wars research in the 1991 budget. Congress last year cut $1
billion from the program, which many see as a fat target for
reductions given the low risk of a Soviet nuclear attack.
   The administration says a growing number of smaller nations are
acquiring ballistic missiles, even while the superpowers are
negotiating big cuts in their arsenals. So, they say, Star Wars
could be used to knock down a missile fired from Iran or another
hostile nation.
   The president also faces a tough fight in Congress over his
request for billions of dollars to begin modernizing _ and, in some
cases, expanding _ the network of production plants and
laboratories that make U.S. nuclear weapons.
   Some lawmakers say they'll oppose Bush's plan to spend up to
$600 million to extend the life of the Rocky Flats plutonium
processing plant near Denver that cost $225 million to build but
has never worked properly. The plan runs against the grain of a
Democrat-led move in Congress to seek a superpower ban on
production of nuclear arms materials.
   ``We are not exactly living at the height of the Cold War. What
is the rush to build a new facility at Rocky Flats?'' asks Sen.
Timothy Wirth, D-Colo.
   While the size and scope of defense spending cuts are debated,
the military is pondering its future in a fast-changing world.
   Sullivan, the Army deputy chief of staff, says his service
already is implementing a ``new vision'' of a smaller Army, one
with more mobility and fewer foreign bases, but also one that could
be easily expanded.
   One question on the minds of recruiters as well as soldiers who
survive manpower cuts is: How's the job going to change?
   Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, says one
new chore will be fighting the drug war.
   Bush's 1991 budget calls for Pentagon spending of $1.2 billion
to combat illegal drugs. That's less than one-half of 1 percent of
the total Defense Department budget request, but it would mean a
big increase in military resources to help in drug patrols along
the border with Mexico and in deployment of National Guardsmen to
stop drug trafficking.
   Marines have been assisting Border Patrol agents in drug
surveillance since last fall. Also, last summer Bush sent about $65
million worth of helicopters, weapons and other military supplies
to Colombia to try to stem the flow of illegal drugs to America and
to help Colombia battle its drug cartel.
   ``We are in this one for the long haul,'' Powell said of the
Pentagon's anti-drug mission.

<HEAD>Change in South African TV Brings Political Shifts to Livingrooms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURINDA KEYS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a significant policy shift,
the state-run television news is giving South Africans a chance to
see for themselves the dramatic political changes taking place
across the country.
   The extensive live broadcast of Nelson Mandela's release after
27 years in prison Feb. 11 was unprecedented for a spot news
development. The South African Broadcasting Corp. scrapped much of
its Sunday programming to show Mandela's walk to freedom.
   For South African television reporters it was a new experience;
they rarely had been called upon to do live commentary.
   But SABC's chief political reporter, Clarence Keyter, got caught
up in the excitement, repeatedly telling viewers they were about to
watch history in the making.
   He did not have the backup that Western television
correspondents have in such situations. When the Mandela story
dragged _ his release was 75 minutes behind schedule _ the studio
provided no pre-taped biographies of Mandela or other short
features that could fill the intervals. Thus Keyter was left to
think of new things to say when nothing was going on. At one point
the commentator described Victor Verster prison as probably the
most beautiful jail in the world.
   A more lively, open-minded approach to news coverage began when
President F.W. de Klerk took over from P.W. Botha six months ago.
Botha had kept a close watch on the domestic television service and
on at least one occasion called the newsroom in mid-broadcast to
order changes.
   The nightly television news shows had the trappings of
propaganda programs, carefully filtering out disturbing scenes and
opposition accusations while emphasizing the government's line on
every issue.
   But on the night of Feb. 2, after de Klerk legalized 60 banned
organizations and lifted restrictions on hundreds of government
opponents, white viewers listened to televised comments from a
string of black activists they had been taught were among South
Africa's worst enemies.
   In recent months, viewers have seen throngs of blacks, chanting,
singing with fists and banners raised, marching in protests that
would have been mentioned _ if at all _ in a sentence or two
without pictures a year ago.
   Much of the change is due to Carel van der Merwe, a journalist
with 25 years' experience in broadcasting and newspapers, who
returned to SABC as director of news last August, when de Klerk
came to power. Van der Merwe's view that television journalism
should be ``gripping, understandable and fair,'' has made a
striking difference in what people now see on the evening news.
   The televising of Mandela's speech at a Cape Town rally on the
day of his release, and his news conference the following day, in
which he endorsed the organization's guerrilla actions, would have
been illegal just a few weeks ago.
   U.S. television networks carried live material on Mandela's
release and his address to the rally. SABC delayed its start of
Mandela's address, which began while the regularly scheduled
evening news was on, but switched live after the news and all that
was missed were tributes at the beginning, said Rob Stevenson,
SABC's evening news editor.
   SABC is run by a board appointed by the nation's president and,
by law, has a monopoly on news broadcasting, although two
independent radio stations in self-governing black homelands can be
heard in some cities.
   During the height of political unrest in 1984-86, most South
Africans never saw pictures of black protests, stonings, arson and
police violence that the rest of the world saw. Government
officials told them night after night that the unseen violence in
their country was caused by leaders of the African National
Congress and the Communist Party, who were never shown and were
quoted only selectively and rarely.
   Sometimes the faces of people like Anglican Archbishop Desmond
Tutu were shown speaking, while the television announcer
paraphrased their words.
   Tutu's first voluntary appearance on SABC was last October, in a
debate on religion in politics, in which he was allowed 15 unedited
minutes to make his points. The experience encouraged Tutu, who had
once refused to answer questions from SABC reporters, to give more
interviews.
   ``He's still rather cautious about it, but people in the SABC
have told us privately there are changes and it certainly appears
to be getting out of the tight government control,'' said Tutu's
spokesman, John Allen. ``The people working there appear to be
conservative, but the journalists are exercising more discretion.''
   Cabinet ministers who were accustomed to giving uninterrupted
and unchallenged speeches in response to soft queries from TV
interviewers are now being questioned on national television by
black reporters and editors from newspapers the government once
tried to suppress.
   One of the most dramatic changes in the approach to news was
illustrated by a transportation strike in January, when more than
30 people were killed and millions of dollars of damage done to
government-owned railroad equipment. Amid the reports of clashes
and violence, the black leader of the South African Railway and
Harbor Workers Union was on television, giving his side of the
story.
   In contrast, during a mine strike in 1987, one of the costliest
and longest in South African history, the leader of the black
miners union was never heard from until the strike ended.
   ``For years they've had a kind of doctrine where the official
view always takes precedence,'' said Gus Silber, a television news
analyst and freelance writer. ``In any story about unrest or
political controversy, they always led with the official response,
the opposite way that other journalists do things.''
   But Gavin Stewart, a journalism professor at Rhodes University,
says: ``The new approach does not mean the SABC is independent of
the government. It just happens that government policy is now more
reasonable.''
   ``The SABC is only changing because the official line is
changing,'' agreed Silber. ``Until a couple of months ago, the
official line was the ANC was a terrorist organization that was
never to be spoken to. Now the ANC gets the same treatment as other
organizations.''
   Anti-apartheid activists are changing their attitudes, too,
answering news conference questions from SABC reporters and
agreeing to appear on broadcasts they once dismissed as government
propaganda.
   ``I think people realize it makes sense to put their point of
view to viewers of the SABC who haven't heard and don't usually
hear it,'' said Moegsien Williams, editor of South, a newspaper the
government suspended in 1988. Williams recently was part of a panel
questioning Foreign Minister Pik Botha on national television.
   When Walter Sisulu and six other ANC leaders celebrated their
release from prison in October, rally organizers refused the SABC
permission to set microphones near the stage. Television showed
pictures of the meeting, but could not broadcast the black leaders'
words.
   Now Sisulu appears on television and radio regularly.
   Van der Merwe said the overwhelmingly positive viewer response
has encouraged SABC ``to carry on trying to be a good news medium.''
   To those shocked at seeing Communists and former guerrilla
leaders speaking on their television screens, van der Merwe said,
``They will have to accept that their own viewpoint in life is not
the only viewpoint.''

   No, it's the opening sequence of ``Revenge,'' directed by Tony

   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., which rose to
prominence by pioneering the market for high-risk junk bonds and
using them to fuel the 1980s takeover boom, now finds itself
looking for outside help because of its deteriorating junk bond
holdings.
   The firm's announcement Monday that it was seeking a major
investor or merger partner followed three days of marathon talks
with federal regulators, who worried that a collapse of Drexel
would shake public confidence in the nation's financial markets,
The New York Times reported.
   Securities industry analysts and former Drexel executives echoed
those concerns. They said the firm's difficulties with the
declining junk-bond market it helped create and its 1989 guilty
plea to federal securities fraud crimes could deter potential
investors.

costs related to its $14 billion acquisition of Warner
Communications Inc.
   Despite the loss, reported Monday, securities analysts said they
were satisfied with the results because Time Warner's cash flow _
which is crucial for paying off its $10.6 billion in debt _ was
strong.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wells-Gardner Electronics Corp. manufactured
televisions before the Japanese were even a blip on the industry
screen. Now, they're hoping to stage a comeback with a new line of
U.S.-made sets.
   The accent is decidedly American in the company's deal with
Majestic Industries Inc., a year-old Maryland-based independent
distributor managed by a team of former RCA executives.
   Stamped ``Made in America,'' the new televisions will be built
at Wells-Gardner's plant on Chicago's northwest side and marketed
to middle America _ rural residents and suburbanites who prefer
old-fashioned console-model TV sets.
   Some parts will be made in places like Taiwan, Mexico and
Malaysia, but the full assembly process will take place at the
275,000 square-foot plant, Richard Conquest, the company's chief
financial officer, said in a telephone interview Monday.
   The company doesn't have any intention of trying to compete
head-on against Japanese giants like Sony and Mitsubishi, Conquest
said. Instead, he said Wells-Gardner simply wants to get back into
a business where it once played a leading role _ supplying
private-label televisions.
   ``That's our cup of tea,'' Conquest said. ``We're really excited
about it.''
   The three-year Wells-Gardner contract is designed to fill an
industry void, said James Schwab, president of Majestic.
   ``What we saw was that with the basic marketing, most television
manufacturing was aimed at the top 200-300 retailers, so their
sales, planning, and product offerings were aimed at the top
retailers,'' he said.
   ``This left a void with the independent retailer, who needs
local support from an independent distributor,'' Schwab said.
   Seventy percent of the sets Wells-Gardner plans to make will be
traditional console models. They will be sold under the Majestic
name through independent dealers rather than mass retailers like
Sears, Roebuck and Co. and J.C. Penney Co.
   Production starts this week, with 24,000 to 30,000 sets
scheduled to be built in the first year, Conquest said. The sets
should become available to consumers within a month.
   ``It will add approximately $10 million to our 1990 sales,''
Conquest said. That would represent about 30 percent of 1989's
estimated sales of $35 million. For now, Wells-Gardner doesn't have
any plans to build TVs for other distributors, officials said, but
the company might consider similar deals in the future with
retailers like Highland, Silo and Fretters.
   Wells-Gardner was founded in 1924 as a radio manufacturer.
   The company diversified in the television age and was one of the
first makers of black-and-white sets. It was a major manufacturer
of sets sold in stores like Sears and Penney's, Conquest said.
   ``Then in the 1970s, the Japanese came in and we got out of the
TV business,'' he said, explaining that the company couldn't
compete with cheaper overseas labor costs.
   At the end of the 1970s, the company decided to try again and
began assembling sets for Fujitsu's Teknika division.
   But the Japanese company, deterred by high import duties and
U.S. labor costs, decided not to renew the contract in 1988,
Conquest said.
   In the meantime, Wells-Gardner has focused its energies on
making monitors for coin-operated video games, which account for
about 60 percent of its sales.
   It hopes the new deal will bring stability and help reduce its
dependence on the cyclical video game industry, said President
Frank J. Myers.
   The company rejoins an industry now dominated by foreign-owned
firms like RCA and Sony, and Glenview, Ill.-based Zenith
Electronics Corp.
   Zenith is the only remaining American-owned manufacturer of
color TVs that also makes most of its parts, said Bob Violino,
associate editor at Television Digest, a weekly newsletter that
tracks the consumer electronics industry.
   Only a handful of smaller firms, like Wells-Gardner, also
assemble their own sets in this country, he said.
   Wells-Gardner's re-entry won't ``cut into any of these other
companies' shares,'' Violino said.
   Zenith does not expect the move to affect its business, company
spokesman John Taylor said.

<HEAD>Perrier Recall Could Leave French Company Dry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Source Perrier SA's lion's share of the U.S. bottled water
market could begin to evaporate if its recall of the popular
Perrier brand because of benzene contamination lasts for two
months, marketing experts say.
   The bubbly water is being kept out of stores, restaurants and
bars in the United States and Canada after North Carolina officials
found some bottles tainted with small amounts of benzene.
   Perrier said it believes an employee mistakenly used a product
containing the cancer-causing chemical to clean grease from one
bottling line, whose production was destined only for North
America. A spokesman for the French Health Ministry said there was
no contamination at the spring from which the sparkling water flows.
   Although the benzene levels were relatively low _ about two to
four times the five parts per billion level allowable under Food
and Drug Administration standards _ Perrier said it requested the
recall late Friday to restore consumer confidence.
   The company's U.S. subsidiary, Perrier Group of America Inc.,
said Monday it expects to keep the product out of U.S. and Canadian
markets for up to two or three months. However, a spokesman for the
parent company in Paris said the green bottles could be back on
North American store shelves in a week or two.
   ``The timing is more of a problem than the benzene,'' said Al
Ries, chairman of Trout &amp; Ries Inc., a Greenwich, Conn., marketing
strategy firm.
   He said the absence of Perrier for any extended time will
severely test the loyalty of many consumers, who may be used to
drinking the sparking water several times a week.
   Perrier, which turned bottled water into a status symbol several
years ago, accounts for nearly a quarter of the estimated $2.2
billion in annual bottled water sales in the United States,
according to the New York-based Beverage Marketing Corp.
   ``Brands are badges,'' said Ries. ``By that I mean when you sit
at a restaurant table and order a brand by name it says something
about you personally. Not being available will force the consumer
to ask for another brand name. And the smart competitior is going
to move in.''
   Gary M. Stibel, principal of New England Consulting Group of
Westport, Conn., agreed: ``It's a godsend trial opportunity for its
competitors ... if they're smart enough to take advantage of it.''
   But experts questioned whether the numerous other smaller
bottled water companies were strong enough to fill the temporary
void left by Perrier.
   ``No one in the marketplace has seen fit to build a strong No. 2
brand in America if Perrier goes flat,'' said Ries.``Distribution
is the key. The product has to be out there, and the product has to
be widely available.''
   There are about 450 water bottling plants in the United States,
producing more than 600 different brand labels of drinking water,
natural water and spring water, according to Bevmark Inc., a Los
Angeles-based consulting firm. In addition, there are more than 50
brands of imported waters, Bevmark said.
   Perrier also markets Poland Spring, Calistoga and Arrowhead
bottled waters.
   Key brand competitors include Evian and Saratoga, both owned by
BSN of France, and San Pellegrino of Italy.
   David S. Daniel, chief executive officer of Evian Waters of
France Inc., said his company had no intention of capitalizing on
Perrier's problems, although it plans to launch a major new
advertising campaign in the next two weeks. He said it was
coincidence the campaign was starting right after the Perrier
recall.
   ``Right now we don't see any real need to change our strategy or
adjust our spending,'' Daniel said. ``It's pretty much business as
usual.''
   Many marketing experts likened Perrier's problem to that of
Johnson &amp; Johnson, which recalled its Tylenol pain killer in 1982
after some capsules were tainted with cyanide, resulting in several
deaths.
   Some of the marketers criticized Perrier's relatively low-key
public relations approach to the problem, which seemed to contrast
with Johnson &amp; Johnson's full-scale public information campaign.
That campaign was credited with helping the company regain market
share following the Tylenol scare.
   But others said Perrier's total recall _ even though only a
dozen bottles were believed to be contaminated _ was more than
enough to reassure consumers.

   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., which rose to
prominence by pioneering the market for high-risk junk bonds and
using them to fuel the 1980s takeover boom, now finds itself
looking for outside help because of its deteriorating junk bond
holdings.
   The firm's announcement Monday that it was seeking a major
investor or merger partner followed three days of marathon talks
with federal regulators, who worried that a collapse of Drexel
would shake public confidence in the nation's financial markets,
The New York Times reported.
   Securities industry analysts and former Drexel executives echoed
those concerns. They said the firm's difficulties with the
declining junk-bond market it helped create and its 1989 guilty
plea to federal securities fraud crimes could deter potential
investors.
   ``At this point I think the biggest problem is the loss of
confidence in them,'' said Chris Mahoney, a securities industry
analyst with Moody's Investors Service. ``Who would want to do
business with them if they were a risk not to make it?''
   Drexel announcement was another sign of decline at the firm once
so sure of itself that it made commitments to raise hundreds of
millions of dollars by merely saying it was ``highly confident'' in
its abilities.
   Analysts said Drexel's capital base been reduced to ``a minimum
level'' and that without an infusion the firm could fail to meet
federal capital requirements.
   Individuals familiar with Drexel's internal problems said
confidence was at an all-time low and several key executives had
left in recent months. Pending litigation from its fraud woes also
still plague the firm, which has shrunk to 5,300 employees from a
peak of 10,700.
   ``Financial service companies are confidence and people,'' one
former Drexel executive said. ``There's obviously no confidence and
the best people have left.''
   Led by junk-bond chief Michael Milken, who pioneered use of the
low-grade debt securities for multibillion-dollar takeovers but
left after his indictment last year on fraud and racketeering
charges, Drexel was a symbol of the high-flying, takeover-driven
1980s.
   But the departure of Milken and other top performers combined
with the big slump in the nation's $210 billion junk bond market
has hit Drexel hard. Its large positions in corporate junk bonds
have nosedived, weakening the firm's capital base.
   ``There's no other line of business to keep them strong in order
to make up the difference,'' said analyst Lawrence Eckenfelder of
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   The firm's total capitalization _ the money it relies on to back
its commitments and meet any losses _ shrank to $1.7 billion at the
end of 1989 from $1.96 billion in 1988, leading to rumors on Wall
Street that Drexel was on the verge of being sold or collapsing.
   Drexel is the biggest player in the junk bond market, so if its
financial straits forced it to sell its holdings, prices could drop
sharply in a junk market already weakened by months of bad news.
   In Monday's statement, Drexel said its senior members had
concluded it should seek outside assistance because ``unsettled
markets, particularly in the high-yield area, have adversely
affected the liquidity'' of its parent, Drexel Burnham Lambert
Group Inc.
   Drexel said its securities subsidiary ``continues to have good
liquidity and has satisfactory excess regulatory capital.''
   The firm last week began to shift cash to the strapped parent
from its securities subsidiary, but the move alarmed officials at
the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission, who
feared it might weaken the subsidiary, the Times reported.
   On Monday, Drexel agreed with the government to sell assets and
raise bank loans to keep the firm afloat, the Times said. The Fed
requested that Citibank, Drexel's chief bank for years, and Morgan
Guaranty provide financing while Drexel gets its house in order,
the newspaper said.
   Fed and SEC officials remain directly involved in efforts to
rescue Drexel, the newspaper said.
   A Drexel spokesman said the firm was acting on its own
initiative to raise capital.
   ``We've been in touch with the regulators all along,'' spokesman
Steven Anreder said. ``I don't think they're dictating what we do
as a business entity.''
   Federal Reserve spokesman Joseph Coyne said he was unaware of
any such role by the Fed. Mary McCue, a spokeswoman for the
Securities and Exchange Commission, declined to comment.
   The Times also reported that the New York Stock Exchange had set
up a crisis center on Drexel and that exchange chairman John Phelan
had assured the exchange's board of governors that the firm's
problems were being tackled.
   Exchange spokeswoman Sharon Gamsin declined to comment on the
report, saying only that ``Drexel Burnham is currently a member in
good standing.''
   Jeffrey Bowman, a vice president at Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.,
said the firm's capital is ``at a minimum level.''
   After Drexel's announcement, S&amp;P downgraded its rating on $200
million of the firm's commercial paper to ``single B'' from
``A-3.'' Securities firms rely on the issuance of commercial paper
to finance their business, and the rating downgrade would force
Drexel to pay higher interest on its borrowings.
   ``Repayment of outstanding commercial paper will depend on the
firm's ability to negotiate a capital infusion or alternative
sources of liquidity,'' S&amp;P said.
   Drexel reported a loss of $40 million on $4.1 billion in revenue
for last year, when it paid $650 million to settle the fraud
charges, slashed its work force by nearly one half, sold its retail
brokerage business and overhauled its internal operations under a
civil settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   The firm had made a net profit of $523 million _ $951 million
before taxes _on revenue of $5.3 billion in 1986.

   A U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge has given
Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allies Stores Corp. permission
to obtain $2.4 billion in financing to help them carry out Chapter
11 reorganization.
   Orders approving the loan petitions were entered by the court
clerk's office Monday. U.S Bankruptcy Judge J. Vincent Aug Jr. had
signed them after the office's closing time Friday.
   The filing allowed Federated and Allied to beat the Wednesday
deadline banks had imposed for proceeding with the loans.
   Citibank of New York heads a 90-bank group providing $2.1
billion. Chemical Bank of New York is providing the other $300
million.
   Separately, Nieman Marcus Group sued the two retailing chains,
claiming they hired their new chairman by luring him away from
Nieman Marcus in violation of his contract.
   Neiman Marcus, part of General Cinema Corp. of Newton, Mass.,
said it filed the suit in state court in Dallas, Texas, where the
department store group is based.
   Named as defendants along with Federated and Allied was Olympia
&amp; York Developments Ltd., the Canadian property developing company
that provided a $250 million cash infusion last year to Campeau
Corp., the Toronto-based owner of Allied and Federated.
   Neiman Marcus accused the defendants of ``tortious
interference'' in enticing Allen Questrom to become the chairman
and chief executive officer of Federated and Allied. The suit said
Questrom's contract with Nieman Marcus ran until September 1991.
   Federated, which operates five department store chains, received
permission to obtain $400 million in cash and letters of credit for
working capital and $1 billion for a credit subsidiary that buys
receivables.
   Allied, which operates four department store chains, received
approval to obtain $300 million in cash and letters of credit and
$700 million for its receivables facilities.
   Federated and Allied employ about 100,000 people and operate 260
stores. They listed debts totaling $7.7 billion in their Jan. 15
Chapter 11 filing.
   Officials of the two sister companies, which make up the U.S.
retail division of Toronto-based Campeau Corp., spent two days last
week telling Aug the financing packages were the best they could
obtain.
   Aug heard more than 10 hours of testimony over two days before
granting approval. He said he thought the retailers had met minimum
standards in their arguments, and praised both sides for agreeing
to ``a productive compromise.''
   The stores comprising Federated are Abraham and Straus and
Bloomingdale's of New York, Burdine's of Miami, Lazarus of
Cincinnati, and Rich's of Atlanta. The Bon Marche of Seattle,
Jordan Marsh of Boston, Maas Brothers of Tampa, and Stern's of
Paramus, N.J., are in the Allied group.

   Safeway Stores' plans to issue a modest
amount of stock to the public marks the beginning of the final
chapter in one of the nation's most successful leveraged buyouts.
   ``I don't know of any leveraged buyouts that have numbers like
they have,'' said Brian Suher, an analyst with the brokerage Black
&amp; Co. in Portland, Ore.
   Suher was referring to Safeway's reduction of a staggering $5.7
billion buyout debt to $3.1 billion and its surging operating
profits in the past year. The Oakland-based chain achieved the
turnaround largely by eliminating its least profitable stores in
reducing the size of the chain from 2,326 stores to 1,117.
   Analysts for the past year have praised the buyout for forcing
Safeway to accelerate a restructuring and trim itself quickly to
its most profitable core.
   Chairman and Chief Executive Peter Magowan recently boasted that
although sales last year were $14.3 billion, Safeway's operating
income was greater than when it posted annual sales of $20 billion.
   Those numbers are the stuff of dreams that fueled the buyout
craze of the 1980s.
   In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a
company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. The debt,
often nearly crippling, is repaid with money generated by the
acquired company's operations or the sale of its assets.
   The LBO, as its commonly known, is often used by management to
retain control of a company threatened by a hostile suitor. The
idea is for the company to re-emerge later as a public one,
stronger and more profitable and thereby less subject to takeovers.
   The ability of a company to re-enter the public market also is
crucial to managers' hopes of eventually cashing in their stakes
and reaping big profits from the turnaround.
   The stock sale, announced Monday and the first since the Nov.
30, 1986 buyout, was a show of confidence by the nation's
third-largest supermarket chain.
   The offering of 10 million shares of new common stock will sell
for between $13 and $16 a share. After the offering, the company
will have 100 million shares outstanding.
   Company officials and those at Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts &amp; Co.,
the New York investment firm that managed the buyout, said Monday
they could not comment publicly on the offering because of
restraints by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   The remaking of Safeway began in July 1986 with a hostile tender
offer from the Dart Group Corp., led by Herbert and Robert Haft.
   That attempt forced Safeway to agree to be acquired by Kohlberg
Kravis that fall for $69 a share. The deal left Safeway management
in command and offered certain officers the right to buy 10 percent
of the now closely held concern.
   The deal also left Safeway burdened with debt: a staggering $45
in debt for each dollar in equity, one of the highest such ratios
ever in a large deal.
   To restore profitability, Safeway has been building larger
stores, called ``super'' stores, that offer specialty departments
such as bakeries, delicatessens, pharmacies, seafood counters and
floral and wine shops.
   To offer more services and longer hours, Safeway employees'
hours have gone up 23 percent per store in the past two years.
Safeway was able to win significant contract concessions from its
unions, and wages are now only slightly higher than in 1986.
   The buyout has been lauded as mutually beneficial by both
Safeway and Kohlberg Krravis, which also acquired RJR Nabisco in
the nation's biggest leveraged buyout after a fierce bidding
contest.
   In most cases, Safeway sold operations that were
underperforming. Exceptions were Safeway stores in Britain, which
garnered a strong price, and 172 Southern California stores sold to
the Von Cos. in a $408 million deal. That transaction also made
Safeway the largest shareholder in Vons, the biggest supermarket
chain in the Los Angeles area.
   ``The performance improvement is nothing short of sensational,
but more importantly the public has endorsed their operating
formats,'' Suher said.
   ``They're having marvelous increases because they have changed
from a behemoth that was insensitive to a corporation very, very
sensitive to consumers and communities.''
   Safeway finished the year with a $3 million profit on $14.3
billion in sales, its first profitable year since the buyout.
   Operating profits jumped 42 percent for the year to $463
million, and 80.5 percent in the fourth quarter to $139 million.

   The dollar fell against the yen for the second
consecutive trading day today, and the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key
index declined moderately.
   The dollar closed at 144.48 yen, down 0.24 yen from Friday's
close of 144.72 yen. After opening at 144.53 yen, the dollar was
traded in a narrow range of 144.35 to 144.63 yen.
   It now has lost 1.02 yen in two trading days. Markets were
closed Monday for a national holiday.
   Currency dealers said the yen's relative strength against the
dollar reflects the market's confidence that the governing Liberal
Democratic Party is likely to retain a parliamentary majority in
Sunday's elections.
   They also said investors bought the Japanese currency to correct
their long-mark, short-yen positions, accumulated in a recent
mark-buying boom.
   Akihiko Hori, a dealer with Mitsui Bank, said he expected no
major movements in dollar-yen rates until after the election.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, which shed 228.10 points last Friday, fell another 181.11
points, or 0.48 percent, closing at 37,107.03 yen.
   Dealers said share prices generally remained weak as many
investors retreated to the sidelines with the lower house elections
only five days away.
   Investors also were discouraged by a 29.06-point decline in the
Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wall Street overnight, said a
dealer with a major Japanese securities firm on condition of
anonymity.
   ``No one wants to take part in trading today,'' said a dealer
with Nikko Securities Co., also requesting anonymity. ``With the
national election in sight, we do not expect any increase at least
until it is over.''
   Volume traded on the exchange's first section was estimated at
300 million shares, compared with Friday's 364.37 million shares.
It was the lowest volume since Aug. 28, when 313.60 million shares
changed hands.

   Georgia-Pacific Corp. and Great Northern
Nekoosa Corp. intensified their merger fight, accusing each other
of wrongdoing shortly after Georgia-Pacific sold off assets in
three states to eliminate a potential antitrust problem.
   Great Northern said Georgia-Pacific and three of its key
executives have lied during the $3.8 billion takeover attempt.
Georgia-Pacific then accused Great Northern's directors of
breaching their fiduciary duty by resisting the offer.
   Most of the developments on Monday were in federal court in
Portland, where Great Northern told U.S. District Judge Gene Carter
that Georgia-Pacific's tender offer should be blocked because the
hostile suitor has lied about an alleged plan to sell Great
Northern's mills in Millinocket and East Millinocket as well as 2.1
million acres of Maine.
   ``G-P is lying. They're not telling you their true plans,'' said
Great Northern attorney Bernard Nussbaum, of New York. Nussbaum
asked Carter for a preliminary injunction halting the merger
attempt as well as Georgia-Pacific's efforts to oust the Great
Northern board at a special shareholders meeting on March 2 in
Portland.
   Georgia-Pacific attorney Stuart J. Baskin accused Great Northern
of ``pandering to the poor people in Maine'' through an unfair
motion that has no basis in law. Baskin, also of New York, said
Georgia-Pacific has produced depositions and affidavits from 14
people, including Georgia-Pacific executives, consultants and
bankers, who dispute Great Northern's contentions about a planned
sale of the Maine properties.
   Great Northern said Georgia-Pacific has violated federal
securities laws by trying to cover up its alleged plans.
   Nussbaum, citing documents dating to at least 1984, said false
statements have come from three Georgia-Pacific officials, Chairman
T. Marshall Hahn Jr. and executive vice presidents A.D. ``Pete''
Correll Jr. and James C. Van Meter.
   Georgia-Pacific spokeswoman Gail Smith said the company stands
by all of its sworn statements.
   The judge said he would rule as quickly as possible.
   After Monday's contentious hearing, lawyers met in chambers with
the judge and agreed to unseal a motion for a preliminary
injunction filed last month by Georgia-Pacific. It alleges Great
Northern's directors have breached their fiduciary duty by
resisting the tender offer.
   Great Northern has called the $63-a-share offer inadequate. But
Georgia-Pacific said that Great Northern's investment banker,
Goldman Sachs &amp; Co., conducted a study last spring that put the
value of Great Northern's stock at somewhere between $46.39 per
share and $68.75 per share.
   The motion asks the judge to force Great Northern to rule out
the use of its ``poison pill'' bylaws that are designed to thwart a
hostile takeover and to strike down ``golden parachute'' payments
that will be given to Great Northern's executives if they lose
their jobs in the battle.
   Georgia-Pacific also asked the judge to force Great Northern's
directors to refrain from using Maine's anti-takeover act to block
the merger and to correct alleged misleading statements about its
plans to invest money that would rebuild its aging mill in
Millinocket. Georgia-Pacific has called Great Northern's previously
announced plans for Maine ``a pipe dream.''
   Great Northern issued a statement that said the Goldman Sachs
study was ``stale'' and ``originally prepared for a different
purpose than evaluating a bid for the company.'' Georgia-Pacific
acknowledged that it did not know what methodology was used in
computing the stock value.
   Also Monday, Great Northern filed papers saying it wanted to
pursue a speedy appeal of an order last week from Carter, who ruled
it will take just a two-thirds vote by Great Northern's
shareholders to oust the Great Northern board. Great Northern's
bylaws called for a three-fourths vote, but the judge agreed with
Georgia-Pacific that two-thirds was the most allowed under Maine
corporate law.
   The judge also ruled that shareholders and not the outgoing
board members, can immediately replace the directors, if they are
ousted, as he struck down other aspects of Great Northern's bylaws.
   Before the court battle on Monday, Georgia-Pacific announced it
had agreed to sell safety-paper operations in Vermont, Iowa and New
York to remove an antitrust question in the takeover attempt.
   The company said it was selling facilities in Gilman, Vt., and
Burlington, Iowa, to Seattle-based Simpson Paper Co., for a price
that would not be disclosed unless lawyers are forced to do so in a
separate lawsuit in federal court in Bridgeport, Conn. The deal
also calls for the sale of two wet process machines and a precision
sheeter in Warwick, N.Y.

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's auto dealers are approaching the
Big Three's quick oil-change operation offers cautiously, wondering
if the investment is worth the return.
   General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. are offering packages to
dealers who want to offer oil changes that would take about a half
hour and cost around $20.
   Typically, quick oil changes involve a new oil filter, oil, spot
lubrication on doors and some suspension joints, filling brake and
windshield washer reservoirs and checking tire pressure.
   Dozens of companies have sprung up nationwide offering the
service in drive-through bays, and the idea is a topic among
members of the National Automobile Dealers Association, which is
holding its annual convention here.
   The idea is to get consumers into the dealership's service area
on a routine, non-warranty basis. That can result in increased
service or parts business and quickly become the bread and butter
for the dealers.
   Many of the nation's 20,000-plus auto dealers, about half of
whom are not making money, rely on profits generated by their parts
and service departments to keep them financially afloat. The setup
also would profit the automakers' in-house parts operations.
   But money stands in the way for Tony Fuentes, general manager of
Don Thornton Ford of Tulsa, Okla. He said the Ford program, which
includes a lift, close-at-hand tools and parts, would cost him
$24,000.
   ``In the past,'' he said, ``people would not think of a
dealership for this stuff. You went to dealerships for warranty
work.
   ``Once the warranty expires, bang, they go off to an
independent'' mechanic.
   Wayne Phillips, a consultant for the NADA, said he's found that
dealers are interested in the operations, but cautious about them.
   ``In some areas, it can be a very profitable thing,'' he said,
especially if the dealership is on a busy street.
   Ford was the first to offer quick oil changes nationwide. Five
dealer in Chicago had it in June 1988. That number grew to 25 by
October 1988. General Motors Corp. started a pilot program at about
100 dealerships in and around four manor cities in 1989 and
Chrysler Corp. also has some dealers offering the service.
   Dealers are approaching the offers in a variety of methods.
   Colonial Dodge in Rockville, Md., offers an oil change and quick
lubrication for $9.95.
   ``We want more traffic in the back'' of the service department,
where more expensive work is performed, said Al Briggs, general
manager of the dealership.
   George Hornbeck III, owner of Hornbeck Chevrolet-Cadillac in
Carbondale, Pa., isn't interested in the operations.
   ``I kind of think I'm not going to go that way,'' he said. ``I'm
not ready to put that money out for something I already do.''

   Prices fell in early trading on Wall Street
today as traders remained preoccupied about interest rates.
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 7.43 to 2,611.71 as of 10
a.m. EST.
   Declining issues were ahead of advancers by a margin of about 8
to 5 in trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 358
stocks rising, 578 falling and 502 unchanged.
   Volume came to 22.16 million shares after the first half-hour of
trading.
   Analysts said strong retail sales announced by the government
today underscored concerns about rising interest rates. Traders and
economists believe the Federal Reserve is less likely to relax
credit and allow interest rates to fall when the economy appears
strong, and robust retail sales are an indication the economy is
not about to falter.
   The Commerce Department said today that retail sales, driven by
renewed automobile sales incentives, climbed 1.6 percent in
January, the steepest increase in more than a year.
   Other analysts said Wall Street was taking its cue from the junk
bond market, which was down sharply today.
   Among blue chip issues, AT&amp;T was off &lsqb; at 39{, Exxon was down \
at 46~, and Philip Morris slipped &lsqb; to 38{.
   The most actively traded issue on the NYSE was Central Illinois
Power, off \ at 22&rsqb;.
   The NYSE's index of all its listed common stocks was off 0.66 at
181.89. On the American Stock Exchange, the market value index was
down 0.70 at 358.17. On Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average
fell 29.06 to 2,619.14.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
479 up, 1,042 down and 442 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to a light 118.39
million shares, down from 146.91 million Friday.

   Integrated Resources Inc., once the nation's
biggest seller of tax-sheltered investments, sought federal
bankruptcy protection today after talks with creditors collapsed on
restructuring more than $1 billion in debt, much of it in
high-yield junk bonds.
   The troubled financial firm's filing came a day after Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc., the Wall Street junk bond giant that has
foundered because of scandal and financial problems, said it was
seeking financial help. Integrated was an important Drexel client.
   Integrated's filing under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws
protects the real estate and financial services company from
creditors while it continues to operate and attempts to reorganize
its finances.
   The company said none of its subsidiaries and affiliates is
included in the filing, made in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.
   ``We came to the conclusion probably a couple months ago that
we'd have to file eventually in order to deal with issues unrelated
to a consensual restructuring of the debt,'' Integrated Chairman
Stephen D. Weinroth said in an interview.
   Weinroth said the company was forced into the filing because
several creditors who refused to negotiate a restructuring had
filed or planned to file legal complaints seeking more than $40
million owed by the firm.
   Trading in Integrated was halted today on the New York Stock
Exchange. Integrated closed at 25 cents a share on Monday.
   Integrated originally was a real estate company and expanded
rapidly several years ago by selling tax-sheltered investments, but
that business was scuttled by 1986 tax-law revisions. The company
then moved aggressively into insurance and mutual funds, financed
largely through junk bonds arranged by Drexel.
   Integrated said negotiations for restructuring $1.008 billion in
debt had been progressing but a few creditors refused to
participate in the talks. The company said those creditors had the
ability to seize Integrated's assets to satisfy their individual
claims.
   About $800 million of the debt was in junk bonds, the bulk of it
sold by Drexel, whose parent company said today it too is
considering filing for Chapter 11 protection.
   ``We were spending too much time and too much money trying to
stave off actions where the ultimate outcome was not in doubt,''
Weinroth said. ``Sooner or later they were going to get a judgment.
Working out a consensual out-of- court reorganization depends on
the good faith of substantially all the creditors.''
   According to court papers filed this morning, Integrated also
has $610 million in subordinated debt outstanding.
   Weinroth said the firm's assets currently are about $1 billion
less than liabilities. According to its balance sheet for June
1989, the most recent filed, Integrated had total assets of $1.4
billion and a negative net worth of $558 million. Its total debt
was $1.62 billion.
   The firm has estimated it lost about $1 billion in the second
quarter and the company is estimating a large loss _ believed to be
around $200 million _ for the 1989 third quarter.
   According to the bankruptcy court papers, Integrated said its
top 10 creditors included large banks and savings and loans, which
bought much of the junk-bond debt issued by Drexel under its
indicted former bond leader Michael Milken.
   Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. led all creditors with a total
owed of $55.84 million, followed by Chemical Bank with $51.57
million. The rest of the top 10 were:
   Executive Life Insurance Co., $48.8 million in long-term public
debt; Hong Kong Shanghai Banking Corp., $45 million in public and
private debt; Drexel, $41.105 million in total debt exposure;
Imperial Savings and Loan, $39.98 million in public debt; Centrust
Savings and Loan, $39 million in public debt; Canadian Imperial
Bank of Commerce, $33.195 million total; USX Portfolio Inc., $24.09
million in commercial paper; and Mellon Bank, $22.596 million total.
   Earlier this year, Integrated sold its key financial services
businesses to Broad Inc., a Los Angeles financial services concern,
for $95 million. The company had hoped to receive about $450
million for the units.
   Other units were either liquidated or sold to other parties and
Weinroth said the firm has sold about $175 million in assets so far.
   Integrated said it expects to resume talks with creditors soon.

   Prices moved lower on Wall Street today as the
release of a new economic indicator heightened pessimism about
interest rates.
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 16.44 to 2,602.70 as of 11
a.m. EST.
   Declining issues were ahead of advancers by a margin of about 7
to 3 in trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 354
stocks rising, 858 falling and 483 unchanged.
   Volume came to 53.28 million shares after the first 90 minutes
of trading.
   Analysts said strong retail sales announced by the government
today underscored concerns about rising interest rates. Traders and
economists believe the Federal Reserve is less likely to relax
credit and allow interest rates to fall when the economy appears
strong, and robust retail sales are an indication the economy is
not about to falter.
   The Commerce Department said today that retail sales, driven by
renewed automobile sales incentives, climbed 1.6 percent in
January, the steepest increase in more than a year.
   The parent of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. said today it might
seek federal bankruptcy protection for most of its operations, but
some analysts said the news had little effect on the stock market.
Many traders have been aware of the investment firm's problems,
said Ralph Acampora, a stock market analyst for Kidder Peabody and
Co.

<HEAD>Digital Announces Venture in Hungary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Digital Equipment Corp., plagued recently by slow
U.S. sales, today formally announced formation of a joint venture
company to sell and service its computer systems in Hungary.
   Digital, the world's second largest computer company behind
International Business Machines Corp., said in a news release from
Budapest that the new venture called Digital Equipment (Hungary)
Ltd. will begin operations April 2.
   ``History has shown that information technology can often be a
lubricant of change,'' said Alberto Fresco, vice president and
country group manager of Digital in Europe. ``As Hungary moves
forward with its plans to restructure its economy, computers will
play an important role ...''
   The opening of new markets in Eastern Europe would be a welcome
development for U.S. computer makers, which have been mired in a
slump. Digital reported last month that its profit for the
October-December quarter fell 44 percent from a year earlier
because of the slow U.S. computer market.
   ``Eastern Europe represents one of the few untapped markets that
have long-term potential,'' said Terry Shannon, an analyst with
International Data Corp., a computer market researcher in
Framingham.
   ``Given the changes in the geopolitical climate, this is
laudatory on Digital's part,'' Shannon said.
   Digital will control the Hungarian venture, owning 51 percent.
It has the option of acquiring 100 percent of the joint venture
company and forming a wholly owned subsidiary in the future. The
remaining 49 percent will be split equally between KFKI, a research
institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, and Szamalk, a
software company.
   Digital, based in the Boston suburb of Maynard, explored the
possibility of doing business in Eastern Europe about a year ago by
sending representatives to Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
   The group found that Hungary was furthest along in political and
economic reforms and had relatively strong development in
technology.
   Digital's activity in Eastern Europe has been severely limited
since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 prompted tighter
U.S. trade restrictions with the Eastern bloc.
   Before then, however, Digital had ``significant business'' in
that region, said Robert Krause, senior trade representative for
Digital.
   The company now hopes restrictions will be eased by the
Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, an agency
with representatives from most NATO countries, Japan and Australia,
that regulates what technology can be exported to Eastern Europe.
   Although Digital has been unable to sell much of its equipment
in Eastern Europe, its machinery has been imported through illicit
channels, and computer makers there have tried to duplicate Digital
products.
   Fredrickson, the Digital spokesman, said the company has not
decided whether to service those machines.
   Shannon, the analyst, said, ``I wouldn't recognize the existence
of a pirated machine.''
   But Shannon added that even if Digital does not service the
equipment, it will have an advantage in marketing its products
because ``the illicit base creates a familiarity with Digital
hardware and operating systems.''

   Chrysler Corp. today said it has
agreed to sell Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. for $825 million to a
partnership of Gulfstream Chairman Allen E. Paulson and the New
York investment firm Forstmann, Little &amp; Co.
   ``Allen Paulson certainly knows Gulfstream and its strengths,''
Chrysler Chairman Lee A. Iacocca said in announcing the deal.
   Iacocca said proceeds of the all cash transaction would go to
general operations of the company. ``We're happy with the price,''
he said.
   Chrysler purchased the Savannah, Ga. maker of corporate jets in
1985 for $637 million.
   The deal is not subject to any financing conditions nor will it
be financed with any junk bonds, Forstmann Little and Paulson said
in a news release.
   The partners jointly will provide all of the equity while
Forstmann will supply the subordinated debt, bringing its total
investment in Gulfstream to about half of the purchase price.
   The balance of the financing has been promised by Manufacturers
Hanover Trust Co.
   Paulson, commenting on the deal, said: ``Aviation is my life.
I've been at it since I was 18. Many well known organizations
offered to be my partner in buying Gulfstream, but I chose to team
up with Forstmann Little.
   ``The capital structure of our company, which will have no junk
financing whatsoever, will allow us to invest in the continued
growth of the G-IV program, as well as new technologically advanced
products,'' said Paulson who founded Gulfstream.
   In a related development, Paulson said that he and Forstmann
have made a bid to buy Lear Jet for $60 million. He said at a news
conference in Savannah that Gulfstream and the Wichita,
Kansas-based Lear could share engineering and marketing technology.
   Chrysler said Dec. 6 it was considering selling its Chrysler
Technologies Corp. subsidiary, of which Gulfstream is a part, to
raise cash. Gulfstream chairman Allen Paulson said at the time he
was negotiating with an investment firm to prepare a bid.
   Chrysler Technologies also includes Electrospace Systems Inc., a
defense electronics company headquartered in Richardson, Texas,
which is still for sale, the company said.

<TEXT>
   IBM said today that it has become the first
company to start pilot production of a 16-million-bit computer
memory chip, which has four times the memory capacity of today's
most advanced chips.
   Currently, the largest-capacity chips in commercial use hold 4
million bits of information.
   A bit is the smallest piece of information processed by a
computer, and can be thought of as the digits 1 or 0. It represents
an electrical switch either being turned on or off.
   A 16-million-bit chip can store the equivalent of about 1,600
pages of double-spaced, typewritten text.
   International Business Machines Corp. announced just last June
that it had started commercial production of the 4-million-bit chip.
   IBM spokesman Paul Bergevin said the company, based in Armonk,
N.Y., has been researching 16-million-bit chips for several years.
The company said it recently began producing the chips on a trial
basis at its semiconductor plant in Essex Junction, Vt., on an
existing chip assembly line.
   Bergevin said commercial, volume production of the new chip
could be 18 months to two years away. All the chips IBM makes are
used in its own computers.
   Other companies are known to be working on 16-million-bit chips,
but none so far has announced production, Bergevin said.
   Last month, IBM announced that it had entered into a joint
venture with Siemens AG, the large West Germany electronics
company, to develop a 64-million-bit chip, which would be the next
gereration of chips. Because of the way chips are constructed,
advances usually take place in intervals of four times greater
capacity than the previous generation.

<TEXT>
   Lincoln Savings and Loan Association spent $55
million _ more than Phoenix millionaire Charles H. Keating Jr. paid
for the thrift _ in an 18-month battle with federal examiners over
its loans and investments, Keating's key aide said today.
   Judith Wischer, president of the thrift's holding company,
American Continental Corp., testified in U.S. District Court that
an examination expected to be a routine six-month audit escalated
into a ``battle of experts.''
   Testifying on Keating's suit to undo the government's takeover
of the Irvine, Calif., thrift last April, Mrs. Wischer said the
government auditors had little or no experience with Lincoln's
investments in bonds or large loans for commercial real estate and
construction projects.
   ``It's a shocking number,'' she said of Lincoln's cost in
answering questions and demands by the examiners. ``We hired
experts to critique the reports their experts critiqued. We estmate
the 18-month examination cost of $55 million.''
   Keating has said previously that he viewed the 1986-87 exam as
harassment and has cited it as a reason for taking his case against
the regulators to members of Congress whose political campaigns he
helped finance.
   Mrs. Wischer testified earlier that Lincoln's 26 branches in the
Los Angeles area were ``run down'' and ``dirty'' when Keating
bought the thrift in February 1984 for $51 million.
   ``It was a dying institution,'' she said. ``The operation side
was almost non-existent. They were still operating with manual
typewriters, had no ATMs (automatic teller machines) and no
communications system for relaying messages quickly between
branches and headquarters.''
   Government attorneys repeatedly objected Monday to questions by
Keating's lawyers to Mrs. Wischer about a four-year running battle
between Lincoln and its regulators. However, U.S. District Court
Judge Stanley Sporkin overruled the objections.
   ``I'm trying to get a backdrop here,'' the judge said.
   In seven previous days of testimony, the government called
Keating, his son and a son-in-law as hostile witnesses in pressing
their motion to dismiss Keating's suit.
   Mrs. Wischer testified that American Continental turned Lincoln
from a losing home mortgage lender into a nearly $7 billion empire
and an aggressive and profitable investor in stocks, junk bonds and
real estate.
   In its takeover, the government said those investments using
federally insured deposits constituted ``unsafe and unsound
practices'' that could cost taxpayers up to $2 billion _ losses
Keating says never would have occurred if regulators had kept their
hands off his business.
   Mrs. Wischer said American Continental developed interest in
acquiring a thrift as a result of a 1982 law that effectively
allowed thrifts to directly invest up to 40 percent of their
deposits in stocks, bonds and real estate.
   Using high interest rates to lure new deposits put together by
brokers, Keating turned Lincoln from a $1 billion operation to one
with $2.3 billion in assets, some $440 million of it in direct
investments, within a year.
   But in February 1985 the new owners began running into trouble
with regulators at the 11th District Federal Home Loan Bank in San
Francisco, Mrs. Wischer said.
   Although federal examiners that month gave Lincoln a relatively
clean bill of health and California regulators had given it
permission to make up to $950 million in direct investments, she
testified, the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco began
questioning its operations.
   ``The examination went extremely well,'' she said. ``But we
began having trouble with the supervisory agent'' who reported to a
12-member board at the San Francisco bank ``composed of our
competitors.''
   Mrs. Wischer said Lincoln vigorously opposed pending regulations
before the bank board in Washington that cut allowable direct
investments back to 10 percent of a thrift's assets.
   The proposed regulations were modified several times but when
finally adopted in February 1985, Lincoln unsuccessfully sought
waivers, including direct appeals to members of Congress.
   As part of that campaign, Mrs. Wischer said American Continental
``commissioned'' Alan Greenspan, now chairman of the Federal
Reserve Board but then a private consultant, to write a report
supporting Lincoln's investments and management.
   The campaign eventually grew to include raising millions of
dollars for the political causes of lawmakers ``sympathetic'' to
Keating's case _ including $1.3 million for five U.S. senators.
   The five _ Sens. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.; John McCain,
R-Ariz.; John Glenn, D-Ohio; Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., and
Alan Cranston, D-Calif. _ are now under investigation by the Senate
Ethics Committee on charges they improperly interceded with
regulators on Keating's behalf.

   The manufacturer of a fishing kit sold for
children aged 1 to 5 is voluntarily recalling the product because
one part may pose a choking hazard for young children.
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission said last week the
potential danger is presented by the casting plug contained in the
Tadpole Fishing Kit, Model K401, manufactured by the New York-based
FinTek, Inc.
   The kit includes a rod, a reel with line and the black rubber
casting plug. Labeling near the base of the rod reads ``FinTek
Tadpole'' and ``ST330.''
   The agency said about 9,800 of the kits for ``Baby Anglers ages
1-5'' were sold nationwide between December 1988 and May 1989. They
should not have been sold for use by children under age 3, the
commission said.
   Neither the commission nor Fintek is aware of any injuries
associated with the kits, the agency said, but consumers should
take them away from younger children.
   Consumers with questions may contact FinTek at 1-800-237-5537.

   The Associated Press asked two experts on
Eastern European economics to present their views on the prospects
for free markets in the region. Marshall I. Goldman, associate
director of Harvard University's Russian Research Center and Soviet
economics professor at Wellesley College, writes that if history is
any guide, the outlook is discouraging. Charles H. Movit, senior
economist of PlanEcon Inc. in Washington, D.C., writes that despite
enormous obstacles, change is possible. Below is Movit's
contribution.

<TEXT>
   Eastern European nations are undergoing sweeping political and
economic change. There promises to be a most difficult transition
ahead with respect to both.
   These economies have found that the growth model formulated
under Stalinist domination cannot provide satisfactory improvement
in living standards, with the gap between East and West growing and
the price of bureaucratic mismanagement brought home more sharply
day by day in terms of worker unrest.
   What are the prospects that reforms can restore economic
dynamism to Eastern Europe?
   The prospects vary considerably. The two major determinants of
likely success are financial health at the outset and the extent to
which reformers are willing to privatize and integrate with the
rest of the world.
   In some, in an effort to prop up living standards in the face of
sagging growth, former regimes oversaw the buildup of an
overwhelming debt. This debt took two forms _ foreign loans and a
lack of domestic investment.
   In all these countries, bureaucratic mismanagement and
artificially set prices have resulted in serious imbalances and
poor preparation for changing world market conditions. To maintain
cheap basic goods and avoid unemployment, intricate subsidy systems
have been established. This has led to shoddy goods, higher
inflationary pressure and reduced incentives for people to work
hard.
   The answers for the economies of Eastern Europe lie in
privatizing them to restore incentives to workers, pulling down
artificial barriers between domestic and international markets,
spurring the efficiency of domestic enterprises and allowing the
inflow of Western investment.
   Privatizing means both absorbing some of the financial liquidity
of the population in the disposal of state-owned productive assets
and relying more directly on the profit motive. Western investment
would bring in resources to renovate aging capital stock, inject
more up-to-date technology and improve the competitiveness of
exports. Service sectors have been neglected and offer fertile
ground for enterprises, attractive in some cases to Western
investors.
   Even in the countries with the brightest prospects _
Czechoslovakia, East Germany and Hungary _ reforms must go
radically in the direction of a dominant private enterprise sector.
This will mean a painful transition during which much economic and
social dislocation is bound to take place.
   Will Western investors respond to the opportunities offered in
Eastern Europe? There are a number of reasons to think that even
prudent investors can find them attractive.
   The region offers the lowest labor costs of all industrialized
countries. Workers are relatively well-educated and highly skilled.
Expected movements in exchange rates will mean, moreover, even more
favorable comparison of wage rates vs. potential investments
elsewhere.
   Turning around East European economies will certainly require
determination, farsightedness, a helping hand from Western
governments, a reawakening of entrepreneurial spirit at home, and a
good deal of luck.
   There is no reason to believe, however, that an appropriate
combination of radically new policies could not bring new dynamism
and a real transformation for some of these economies, with a
timeframe of about 15 years or somewhat longer.

   When Sybron Corp. negotiated a joint venture in Budapest, talks
stalled while attorneys for the Hungarian partners grappled to
translate ``profit.''
   ``It was difficult to put the word profit in the contract in
Hungarian so we wrote it in German,'' said Donald Rackl, chief
financial officer for the Milwaukee manufacturer.
   Sybron weathered that and many other problems starting its first
business in Eastern Europe. The company expects to dance around
bigger business potholes when its microscope-slide plant starts
production this year.
   Even a veteran like PepsiCo Inc., after years of operating in
the region, has altered the way it normally does business in order
to cope with problems alien to the West.
   Pepsi plants in Czechoslovakia sometimes run out of bottles due
to late shipments. In the Ukraine, state officials snatch soft
drink delivery trucks to haul harvested wheat, said Richard Norton,
PepsiCo vice president for Eastern Europe.
   Adapting to such inconveniences is part of reality in countries
still shaking off the dust of communist rule. Less easily overcome
are structural and economic problems: rapid inflation, huge foreign
debt and inconvertible currencies that make it difficult to turn
profits into dollars.
   In many respects, the revolution in Eastern Europe remains only
a promise. Several countries haven't written laws on foreign
ownership and joint ventures. They lack legal systems and courts,
leaving Western businesses vulnerable if, for example, suppliers
don't deliver and customers don't pay.
   Yet for all the problems, Eastern Europe may well represent the
greatest commercial and financial opportunity since the rebuilding
of Western Europe after World War II. The region's 136 million
consumers crave everything from french fries to shoe polish,
telephones to computer disks.
   For companies with global aspirations and patience for profits,
Eastern Europe is ``a pot of gold,'' said Chicago University
business professor Marvin Zonis.
   ``There are real possibilities out there and they ought to be
pursued,'' Zonis said.
   The Commerce Department's own analysts have said firms dealing
in agriculture, health care, telecommunications, energy, tourism,
and housing may have the best chance of gaining entry and
prospering in East European markets.
   There are plenty of reasons for American companies to invest.
Cheap labor is one of the biggest. The average hourly manufacturing
wage in Hungary, Poland and Yugoslavia in 1988 was $1.35 to $1.71,
said PlanEcon Inc., a Washington research concern specializing in
Eastern Europe.
   Wages could even fall in dollar terms because of an expected
decline in exchange rates.
   Moreover, East European workers are relatively well educated and
highly trained compared with Third World counterparts. Low labor
productivity may be a concern, but some economists say that's
correctable.
   ``Workers get lazy and depressed when they get stuck with guys
who are doing a bad job of running things,'' said Edward Yardeni,
chief economist at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Perhaps the biggest incentive for U.S. corporations to invest in
Eastern Europe is global competition. U.S. giants like General
Electric Co., International Business Machines Corp. and General
Motors Corp. are already there, but so are rivals Suzuki Motor Co.;
Siemens AG, West Germany's giant electronics company, Ferruzzi
Finanziara SPA, Italy's leading chemical and agribusiness company,
and British Telecom. Others are on the way.
   Eugene Theroux, an attorney in the Washington office of the
international law firm Baker &amp; McKenzie, said it's a mistake for
American businesses to sit back and watch.
   ``They should make at least a minimum of time, effort and
expense necessary to examine the alternatives,'' said Theroux, who
advises companies doing business in communist countries.
   Many companies apparently are doing just that. The Commerce
Department and Chamber of Commerce said they are receiving at least
10 times as many inquiries as last year from American companies _
on everything from investment laws to opportunities and licensing.
Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher opened an information office
on Eastern Europe in January to handle all the calls.
   Lawyers, travel agents and public relations firms are leading
the way, establishing offices and advertising for Western clients.
   ``Cautious optimism has been replaced by opportunism,'' said
Richard W. Edelman, president of New York-based Edelman Public
Relations Worldwide, which has opened offices in Hungary and is
scouting elsewhere.
   But American executives already experienced in Eastern Europe
warn newcomers to calculate the risks. Many early joint ventures in
the Soviet Union failed for lack of a careful business plan. Those
who decide to go should be prepared to stay awhile.
   ``This is an investment that will have long-term rewards instead
of a short-term immediate impact,'' said Andrew B. Somers Jr.,
general counsel for American Express Corp., which has offices in
several East European countries. ``This is not something you dabble
in.''
   Companies in the vanguard also must be prepared to sacrifice
time andnald's discovered
opening its first restaurant in Moscow.
   The opening took McDonald's 14 years, $50 million and its own
supply system that bypasses the deadly Soviet bureacracy.
   While the Soviet Union is considered more treacherous for
enterprising Westerners, economists say Eastern Europe is similar.
   ``Right now if I were an American company I would think the
prospects were very risky given the political and economic
transition,'' said Georgetown University professor Stewart Brown.
   Congress has authorized $300 million in aid for private
enterprise in Poland and Hungary as well as other assistance. The
federal Export-Import Bank will guarantee loans up to $200 million
to Hungary and Yugoslavia.
   But U.S. companies will have to rely largely on their own
resources to establish outposts in Eastern Europe.
   ``Anyone not prepared to suffer losses should not go in,'' Brown
said.

   Western Europe is proffering aid
eagerly to the deprived East, but some European Community members
see the aspirations of their neighbors as both a benefit and danger
to the economic bloc's own integration.
   Political upheavals in the East bloc have raised new commercial
opportunities. At the same time, some worry that the huge task of
aiding Iron Curtain economies could be deemed more politically
urgent than the Community's plans to remove the economic barriers
dividing the dozen West European nations.
   Furthermore, some of the Community's poorer nations such as
Portugal and Greece worry that the group might direct resources to
the East at their expense.
   ``The Community ... is running enormous risks because the pace
of events has fueled the debate on European integration,'' said
Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, the trading
bloc's executive body.
   ``The Community must speed up the pace of European integration
if it is to remain a focal point for others,'' he said in a recent
speech to the European Parliament, the Community's legislative body.
   An ambitious integration plan by the Community scheduled for
1992 envisions a European-wide market of 320 illion consumers,
unfettered by trade barriers. The plan would create a monetary
union with a common currency and central bank and fashion closer
political cooperation in such areas as foreign policy.
   Belgium, Britain, Denmark, France, West Germany, Greece,
Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain
make up the Community.
   Integration plans have not met blanket approval. Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher, for example, is reluctant to make British
monetary policy subject to a single European monetary union.
   But leaders of the Community, also known as the Common Market,
have been united in the desire to help the emerging democracies in
Eastern Europe convert their centrally planned economies into
free-market systems.
   The new governments must deal with poor economic growth, high
inflation, a lack of investment money and infrastructure and, in
some cases, huge foreign debts.
   Heavily indebted Poland, for instance, has virtually no banking
network to support the free enterprise system needed for a
market-driven economy.
   ``There are real doubts as to whether this thing can go through
tidily ... even whether the transition (to market economies) can be
carried through at all completely,'' said Peter Ludlow, director of
the Center for European Policy Studies, a Brussels-based think tank.
   The Community already has directed substantial resources toward
Eastern European economic revitalization in the aftermath of the
region's political upheaval.
   Aid ranging from free food to technical assistance and cash for
improving agricultural and industrial production has been sent or
promised to Hungary and Poland, for example.
   The Community last summer was put in charge of a 24-nation
effort to devise an economic aid package for Poland and Hungary.
Pledges have been received for a special $1 billion fund for
Poland, and the West European nations recently agreed to establish
a development bank to provide low-cost loans and other technical
and economic assistance to Eastern Europe.
   Delors has suggested, using what he called an extreme example,
that it could take $23 billion a year over the next five to 10
years to help achieve economic reform in Eastern Europe.
   However, any call for a sizable increase in Community spending
likely would cause heated debate. The Community's 1990 budget has
been set at about $56.5 billion, with just over half designated for
farm programs.
   An aid package for 66 poor nations in Africa, the Caribbean and
the Pacific recently was pegged at $14.5 billion over five years.
   Willy De Clercq, chairman of the European Parliament's external
economic affairs committee, acknowledged that poor countries might
be concerned about future aid. But he said it would be a wrong for
the trading bloc to ignore other parts of the world.
   There also is speculation that the rich nations, especially West
Germany, will be more inclined to channel money to the East than to
the southern nations of Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece, the
Community's weak spots.
   ``A mark for Leipzig is a mark less for Lisbon'' _ goes one
saying, a reference the possible spending of West German capital in
East Germany rather than in Portugal.
   De Clercq and others maintained the Community would not neglect
its own interests.
   ``We don't see developments in Eastern Europe as a possible
enemy of the Greek economy,'' said a Greek official, who asked not
to be quoted by name. After joining the Community in 1981, Greece
received $6.2 billion over seven years to help modernize.
   Agricultural groups are concerned that tariff reductions and
other special treatment for products grown by Eastern farmers may
hurt their markets.
   ``We know we must help these countries ... but we must be
careful not to create big difficulties here,'' said Andre
Herlitska, secretary-general of the Committee of Professional Farm
Organizations, a group of Community farm unions.
   The European Commission already has negotiated broad trade
agreements with Poland, Hungary and the Soviet Union to lift import
limits and give their products greater access to West European
markets.
   There is a smaller arrangement with Czechoslovakia, likely to be
expanded, and bargaining for accords with East Germany and Bulgaria
is under way. The Community also is taking steps to improve ties
with Romania.
   Trade between the Community and East bloc amounted to $54.6
billion in 1988, about half with the Soviet Union. By comparison,
two-way trade with the United States that year was more than three
times that amount.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly
lower in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade,
reflecting improving crop weather and signs of disappointing
foreign demand.
   A modest early decline in the soybean market was seen mainly as
a follow-through to yesterday's late sell-off from session highs.
   Also, weekend rains helped the developing South American soybean
crop, improving supply prospects.
   In the corn market, the lower opening reflected
lighter-than-expected inspections of corn for export last week, as
reported by the Agriculture Department in its weekly export
inspections report.
   The USDA said it inspected 41.7 million bushels of corn last
week, compared with 58.3 million in the previous week and 45.9
million a year earlier.
   Soybean and wheat inspections also were well below week-earlier
levels.
   Forecasts for precipitation this week in the Central Plains are
keeping the wheat market under pressure.
   Wheat futures were unchanged to 1 cent lower with March at $3.89
a bushel; corn was unchanged to { cent lower with March at $2.41} a

<HEAD>Chrysler Suffers Fourth-Quarter Loss, Year's Earnings Down</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with quotes, detail; ADDS byline; no

<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. said today it had a
fourth-quarter loss of $664 million, including one-time
restructuring charges of $577 million.
   Chrysler said the costs included idling plants in Detroit and
St. Louis, discontinuing some car lines and reducing the
white-collar work force.
   ``It's called restructuring to compete,'' Chrysler Chairman Lee
A. Iacocca said at a news conference.
   More than half the fourth-quarter restructuring charge of $577
million was for supplemental unemployment benefits and retirement
benefits connected with plant closings, Iacocca said. The charge
sliced $2.48 off per-share earnings.
   Chrysler said the loss was equivalent to $2.90 a share, compared
with fourth-quarter net earnings of $433 million, or $1.85 a share,
in 1988. Sales for the quarter sagged to $7.9 billion, compared
with $9.3 billion a year earlier.
   For the year, Chrysler reported net income of $359 million, or
$1.55 a share, on revenue of $34.9 billion. That compares with 1988
net income of $1 billion, or $4.66 a share, on revenue of $34.2
billion in 1988.
   Iacocca said the results would mean no profit sharing for hourly
workers and no bonuses for salaried employees at the nation's
third-largest automaker.
   The earnings report came shortly after Chrysler announced it had
agreed to sell its Gulfstream Aerospace corporate jet manufacturing
unit for $825 million in a cash-raising move.
   Chrysler said it had a fourth-quarter after-tax loss of $87
million, or 38 cents a share, prior to the one-time restructuring
charge.
   Chrysler said Dec. 6 it was considering selling its Chrysler
Technologies Corp. subsidiary, of which Gulfstream is a part, to
raise cash and refocus on automaking.
   The company has cut back excess manufacturing capacity, shutting
down its Jefferson Avenue assembly plant in Detroit and announcing
plans to close its St. Louis car assembly plant this September.
   The company announced a cost-cutting program in October with a
goal of cutting $1 billion from its $26-billion annual budget by
the end of this year, including eliminating 2,300 salaried jobs. It
since has boosted the goal to $1.5 billion.
   Iacocca called the results commendable during what he called a
full-blown recession in the auto industry in the fourth quarter.
   ``I am not in the least disappointed,'' he said. ``Our cash
position just got better, and we're focused.''
   Without the cuts, Iacocca said, ``We probably could have muddled
through, but we chose not to. We chose to get ready for the '90s.''
   The country's top two automakers, General Motors Corp. and Ford
Motor Co., are expected to report earnings later this week. GM
reported a profit of $4.9 billion on revenue of $110.2 billion in
1988, and Ford reported earnings of $5.3 billion on revenue of
$92.4 billion.

<HEAD>London Shares End Slightly Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Stocks finished slightly higher on London's Stock
Exchange Tuesday after an erratic session marked by thin volume.
   Dealers said investors showed little interest in equities for
most of the day, which was dominated by worries over the direction
of West German and British interest rates, and the outlook for U.S.
corporate profitability and its impact on Wall Street.
   But at midafternoon in Europe, stocks were pushed broadly lower
in New York and London by news that the board of directors of the
U.S. investment company Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. would meet
later Tuesday to consider seeking bankruptcy protection.
   However, a late afternoon London rally carried London stock
prices back into positive territory, on the perception that
Drexel's junk bond losses were an isolated problem.
   ``We went from a plus to a minus,'' said one head of market
making in London. ``But just as quickly, the news seemed to be of
little lasting consequence to the London market.''
   By the end of the European day, the Dow Jones industrial average
was off just 3.37 points at 2,615.77, after shedding more than 20
points at one stage.
   At London's close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share
index was up 6.3 points, or 0.3 percent, at 2,293.2.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was up 7.5 points at 1,818.1
at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 1.74 points
to close at 1,250.38.
   Volume amounted to a light 435.3 million shares, compared with
Monday's 338.5 million shares.

<HEAD>FAA Tentatively Orders Changes in Boeing 737s</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration today
tentatively ordered changes in the control panels of Boeing 737s to
prevent a rudder control problem that is one focus of an accident
hearing underway in New York.
   The changes would make it less likely that pilots or cockpit
visitors might accidentally move a rudder trim control knob that
could reduce the pilot's ability to control the plane or force an
aborted takeoff, the FAA said.
   The work would be relatively simple and cost about $820 per
plane, the FAA said in issuing a proposed airworthiness directive.
The directive would become final after a 60-day period for comment.
   The order came as the National Transportation Safety Board
opened a four-day hearing in New York City into the Sept. 20 crash
of USAir Flight 5050 that killed two people. The plane skidded off
the end of the LaGuardia Airport runway into the East River and
broke into several pieces in an aborted takeoff, and investigators
are examining a possible rudder control problem.
   The FAA order would cover all 737-300 and 737-400 models,
affecting 641 airplanes worldwide. Although FAA orders do not
directly apply to planes flown by foreign airlines, they usually
comply.
   The alteration, designed by Boeing, would replace a rudder trim
knob located at the rear of a console between the two pilots and
install a protective guardrail behind the knob to prevent it from
being inadvertently knocked out of alignment. The new knob would be
round and fluted instead of wedge-shaped.
   Investigators into the crash of Flight 5050, which was to take
off for Charlotte, N.C., said the rudder was set all the way to the
left although evidence showed that pilots made all the proper
checks during the aborted takeoff.
   The Air Line Pilots Association on Monday blamed the design of
the rudder trim control for the crash of Flight 5050.
   ``We feel the rudder trim system is what actually precipitated
the USAir accident,'' said ALPA representative Tom Kraemer on
Monday.
   In Seattle, Mark Hooper, spokesman for the Boeing Commercial
Airplane Group, said Boeing had redesigned the trim switch knob
following reports of rudder trim being changed inadvertently.
   Hooper said the design change, adopted Jan. 17, was the result
of Boeing studies begun last May and subsequent reviews by the FAA.
   He said there had been reports of visitors in cockpits who had
placed their feet on the aisle console and may have accidently
turned the knob, or the possibility the knob might have been jarred
by manuals tossed on the console.
   NTSB Chairman James L. Kolstad, who was conducting the New York
hearing, said that in addition to rudder control design, the
hearing would cover cockpit crew training and crew coordination,
the effects of the recent merger of USAir with Piedmont, FAA
surveillance of USAir operations and runway design.

   The parent of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. plans
to file for federal bankruptcy court protection today in a move
that would cap the downfall of one of Wall Street's most powerful
firms of the 1980s.
   The decision on whether to seek protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy law was expected to be approved by
Drexel's board of directors, Drexel officials said.
   Drexel Chief Executive Frederick Joseph told employees on the
firm's internal communications system that the parent company and
certain subsidiaries would file with U.S. Bankruptcy Court today.
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. said it had defaulted on about
$100 million in loans and a lack of cash was threatening other
defaults.
   The board meeting was scheduled to start at 4 p.m. EDT to vote
on whether to file for bankruptcy court protection, but the Drexel
official, who asked not to be named, said the decision already
appeared to have been made. The official said bankruptcy papers
were expected to be filed today.
   Wall Street traders and other sources said Drexel was barely
functioning and was liquidating its huge portfolio of government
securities. Few companies were reported to be trading with the firm
that rose to prominence through the risky junk bonds that also have
marked its downfall.
   Drexel also was said to be transferring customer accounts to
Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., which acquired Drexel's retail
brokerage business last year. Smith Barney said it was considering
taking over the accounts but no decision had been made.
   The accounts were said to be employee or employee-related and
include all types of securities, including stocks and bonds.
   Drexel today also voluntarily withdrew from making markets in
228 stocks traded over the counter through the National Association
of Securities Dealers.
   The firm was able to maintain its duties as a specialist on the
floor of the New York Stock Exchange when another firm, Speer,
Leeds &amp; Kellogg, agreed to clear Drexel trades and guarantee their
financial obligations. Drexel owns the specialist firm Pforzheimer
&amp; Co.
   Drexel said in a statement that a Chapter 11 filing would
exclude the broker-dealer subsidiary, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,
and Drexel Burnham Government Securities Inc.
   The statement said Drexel ``intends to engage in an orderly
liquidation of its positions'' in government securities.
   Drexel said Monday it was seeking a major investor or merger
partner in an effort to raise additional capital. Drexel blamed the
bulk of its problems on the deteriorating market for high-risk,
high-yield ``junk'' bonds that it helped to create in the 1980s
under now-indicted executive Michael Milken.
   Drexel's announcement followed several days of negotiations with
the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Reserve Board
and the New York Stock Exchange over how to prevent a financial
panic over its troubles.
   The dire problems at the investment firm threaten confidence in
the nation's financial markets because of Drexel's preeminence in
the $200 billion junk bond market, which has been slumping since
last fall, when several companies failed to meet financing terms on
their junk bond debt.
   The firm also was hammered by its decision to plead guilty to
six felonies and pay $650 million to the government to settle
federal charges related to insider trading and other offenses.
Drexel was forced to restructure as part of a civil settlement with
the SEC and has cut its work force to 5,300 from 10,700.
   In Monday's statement, Drexel said its senior members had
concluded it should seek outside assistance because ``unsettled
markets, particularly in the high-yield area, have adversely
affected the liquidity'' of its parent.
   Drexel said its securities subsidiary ``continues to have good
liquidity and has satisfactory excess regulatory capital.''
   The firm last week began to shift cash to the strapped parent
from its securities subsidiary, but the move alarmed officials at
the Fed and the SEC, who felt it might weaken the subsidiary.
   The SEC stated today in Washington that it had moved to protect
the assets of the brokerage firm by barring the subsidiary from
transferring net capital to the parent without prior, specific
approval.
   ``Inventory schedules and other detailed financial information
submitted by Drexel Burnham Lambert indicate at this time the
registered broker-dealer has positive net worth and remains in
capital compliance,'' the SEC said.
   The Federal Reserve Bank of New York issued a statement saying
it would ``carefully monitor'' Drexel's decision to liquidate its
position in government securities in consulation with the
government, Drexel's securities subsidiary and other market
participants.
   The bank said Drexel still was designated as a primary dealer in
government securities.
   Junk bond professionals said prices of those securities were
trading slightly higher in a chaotic morning session as rumors
swirled around Wall Street on whether Drexel would file for
bankruptcy protection.
   Dealers in Treasury securities said there was concern that by
selling off its large portfolio Drexel would add supply to the
market and depress prices _ pushing interest rates higher.
   ``You want to talk about an end of an era?'' said Joan
Greenberg, a senior vice president for high-yield bonds at Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Analysts said Drexel's capital base has been reduced to ``a
minimum level'' and that without an infusion the firm could fail to
meet federal requirements.
   Led by Milken, who pioneered use of the low-grade debt
securities for multibillion-dollar takeovers but left after his
indictment last year on fraud and racketeering charges, Drexel was
a symbol of the high-flying, takeover-driven 1980s on Wall Street.
   Drexel reported a loss of $40 million on $4.1 billion in revenue
for last year, when it settled the fraud charges, slashed its work
force, sold its retail brokerage business and overhauled its
internal operations under the SEC civil settlement.
   The firm had made a net profit of $523 million _ $951 million
before taxes _on revenue of $5.3 billion in 1986.

   Prices were narrowly mixed in late trading on
Wall Street today as concerns about interest rates and the growing
troubles of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. eased somewhat.
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 5.41 to 2,624.55 as of 3
p.m. EST.
   Declining stocks were ahead of advancers by a margin of 5 to 4
in trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 634
rising, 803 falling and 491 unchanged.
   The market opened lower after the government announced robust
retail sales figures for January, and took a further dive after
Drexel's parent said it might seek federal bankruptcy protection
for most of its operations.
   But prices began to come back slowly as the market digested both
developments.
   The Commerce Department said retail sales, driven by renewed
automobile sales incentives, climbed 1.6 percent in January, the
steepest increase in more than a year. The news, intepreted as a
show of economic strength, at first led traders to fear the Federal
Reserve would be unlikely to relax credit and allow interest rates
to fall.
   However, analysts said, on closer inspection many traders
decided the surge might be a one-time event.
   The Drexel announcement came as only a small surprise to Wall
Street, as many traders had been aware of the investment firm's
problems, analysts said.
   Once investors overcame their uncertainty about possible fallout
from a Chapter 11 bankruptcy court filing, some buyers saw an
opportunity to go back into the market, the analysts said.
   Among blue chip issues, IBM was up 1| to 102}, AT&amp;T rose &rsqb; to
40, General Electric fell &lsqb; to 62&lsqb;, and Philip Morris was unchanged
at 38|.
   Chrysler fell &lsqb; to 16{ after announcing its fourth-quarter
earnings, and as expected, said it was selling its Gulfstream
Aerospace Corp. for $825 million to a partnership of Gulfstream
Chairman Allen E. Paulson and the New York investment firm
Forstmann, Little &amp; Co.
   Volume came to 125.17 million shares with one hour of trading
left.
   The NYSE's index of all its listed common stocks was up 0.21 at
182.76. On the American Stock Exchange, the market value index fell
0.82 to 358.05.

<HEAD>With AM-Chrysler-Gulfstream, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM S. BERGSTROM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. on Tuesday reported a
$664 million fourth-quarter loss and a two-thirds drop in annual
earnings for 1989, mostly due to costs of closing plants and
cutting jobs.
   The results mean no profit-sharing for hourly workers and no
bonuses for salaried employees at the nation's third-largest
automaker, Chrysler Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lee A.
Iacocca said.
   But Iacocca said the belt-tightening moves were needed to
compete in a slow automotive market.
   ``We looked at ourselves in the mirror back in May and we looked
a little fat. And we looked at the market for the early 1990s ...
and it looked a little grim,'' Iacocca said.
   Much of Chrysler's first quarterly loss since 1982 was from a
one-time restructuring charge of $577 million.
   That covered costs of closing plants in Detroit and St. Louis,
discontinuing some cars and paying pension and severance costs to
trim the white-collar work force, the company said.
   Chrysler also said that to raise cash it had agreed to sell its
Gulfstream Aerospace subsidiary for $825 million, to a partnership
of Allen E. Paulson, chairman and founder of the Savannah,
Ga.,-based maker of corporate jets, and the New York investment
firm of Forstmann, Little &amp; Co.
   ``We've got our capacity down. Our cash position just got a
little better, and we're focused,'' Iacocca told a news conference.
   ``It sounds like back to the basics,'' said auto analyst Mary
Anne Sudol of Fitch Investors Service in New York. ``It's a more
vicious competitive environment, for sure. The race is to the
lowest-cost producer.''
   Iacocca explained that the loss came during what he termed a
full-blown recession in auto sales, necessitating rebates of more
than $1,200 a car just to keep sales limping along.
   ``I am not in the least disappointed,'' he said.
   The quarterly $664 million net loss, equivalent to $2.90 a
share, compared with net earnings of $433 million, or $1.85 a
share, in the fourth quarter of 1988, the company said.
   Chrysler said sales and revenues for the quarter sagged to $7.9
billion from $9.3 billion a year earlier.
   For the year, the company reported net income of $359 million,
or $1.55 a share, on revenues of $34.92 billion, down 66 percent
from $1.05 billion, or $4.66 a share, on revenues of $34.15 billion
in 1988.
   The one-time $577 million charge was partly offset by a $309
million gain on the sale of Mitsubishi Motors Corp. stock, the
company said.
   United Auto Workers President Owen Bieber and Vice President
Stan Marshall, who directs the UAW's Chrysler Department, said they
regretted earnings didn't trigger profit-sharing for hourly workers.
   Under Chrysler's UAW contract, they said in a statement, ``At
least there will be some equality of sacrifice and Chrysler
executives will have to go without bonuses as well.''
   Chrysler has cut back excess capacity, shutting down its
Jefferson Avenue assembly plant in Detroit and announcing plans to
close its St. Louis car assembly plant this September.
   The company also announced a cost-cutting program in October
aimed at cutting $1 billion from its $26 billion annual budget by
the end of this year, including elimination of 2,300 salaried jobs,
and has since boosted the cost-cutting goal to $1.5 billion.
   ``It's called restructuring to compete,'' Iacocca said. ``We
probably could have muddled through, but we chose not to. We chose
to get ready for the '90s. It's all part of our plan.''
   The country's top two automakers, General Motors Corp. and Ford
Motor Co., are scheduled to report earnings Thursday. GM reported
profits of $4.9 billion on revenues of $110.2 billion in 1988, and
Ford reported earnings of $5.3 billion on revenues of $92.4 billion.

<HEAD>Goodyear Reports Earnings Decline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AKRON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., despite improved
profitability of its tire segment, said Tuesday its fourth-quarter
earnings dropped 74 percent from the same period in 1988.
   The Akron-based company attributed the lower profit to higher
taxes on foreign earnings and a first-time inclusion of pipeline
expenses.
   Goodyear reported earnings of $14.7 million, or 25 cents per
share, on sales of slightly more than $2.7 billion, compared with
earnings of $56.4 million, 98 cents per share, and sales of $2.8
billion in the same period a year earlier.
   For the full year, Goodyear's earnings of $206.8 million, $3.58
per share, represented a 41 percent decline from the 1988 earnings
of $350.1 million, $6.11 per share. Sales for the year virtually
matched the $10.8 billion of 1988.
   The company's 1990 earnings outlook was not good, Tom H.
Barrett, Goodyear chairman, indicated in a statement.
   ``We expect the competitive market place and the slowdown in the
U.S. auto industry to continue to impact both our tire and general
products businesses through at least the first half of 1990,''
Barrett said.
   ``To meet the challenge, we are working to reduce manufacturing
and operating expenses as we continue to improve the efficiency of
our production and distrubution operations.''
   Barrett said that in 1989 the company incurred higher taxes on
foreign earnings, while in 1988 Goodyer benefited from a tax credit
associated with pension asset reversion.
   The chairman said inclusion of depreciation and operating and
interest expenses on its All American Pipeline System reduced
earnings in the fourth quarter by $26.4 million.
   In the company's tire segment, operating income declined 8.4
percent in the fourth quarter to $130.7 million, despite improved
business conditions in the United States, where Goodyear
experienced lower raw materials prices and a better product mix to
offset a 3.6 percent sales decline.
   Although the company's engineered products segment did well, the
industrial products and chemical products segments declined.

   The dollar was mostly higher in quiet trading
Tuesday, although the prospect of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s
parent filing for federal bankruptcy protection eroded some of its
earlier gains.
   Gold prices declined after a mixed performance overseas.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current
delivery settled at $417.60 a troy ounce, down $1.60 from late
Monday. Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for
gold at $417.50 an ounce, off $1.20.
   Currency dealers said technical factors were largely responsible
for pushing the dollar higher. But they said an announcement from
Drexel that it planned to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection
because of scandal and financial problems depressed the dollar.
   Linda McLaughlin, a trader with Chemical New York Capital
Markets Group, said the market was concerned that a Drexel filing
would force the Federal Reserve to provide more liquidity in the
market, thereby lowering interest rates.
   Lower interest rates tend to depress a currency's value.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar closed down 0.24 yen at 144.48 yen. It was quoted at
144.25 yen in London, and 144.345 yen in New York, down from 144.37
yen.
   The dollar was stronger against the British pound. Sterling
fetched $1.6907 in London, down from $1.6960 late Monday, and
$1.6895 in New York, down from $1.6918.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
quotes, included: 1.67625 West German marks, up from 1.6755; 1.4975
Swiss francs, down from 1.5005; 5.7015 French francs, up from
5.6965; 1,245.75 Italian lire, down from 1,246.00; and 1.20095
Canadian dollars, up from 1.20065.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Monday: 1.6760 West
German marks, up from 1.6695; 1.4960 Swiss francs, unchanged;
5.6995 French francs, up from 5.6785; 1.8980 Dutch guilders, up
from 1.8890; 1,248.00 Italian lire, up from 1,242.00; and 1.9950
Canadian dollars, down from 1.2023.
   Gold fell in London to $418.65 an ounce from $419.50 late
Monday. In Zurich, gold rose 75 cents to $419.75 an ounce.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $5.17 to close at $419.58 an
ounce.
   Silver prices headed higher. Silver bullion for current delivery
settled at $5.314 a troy ounce, up 2.8 cents. Silver rose in London
to $5.35 an ounce from $5.32.

<HEAD>Lawyers Present Arguments in Smoker Death Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who started smoking as a child and later
died of lung cancer should have been warned by the American Tobacco
Co. that cigarettes posed a health risk before the government
required warning labels, a lawyer told a jury Tuesday.
   But a lawyer representing the cigarette company said the victim,
George Kotler, was free to stop smoking and chose to continue his
habit.
   Attorneys on both sides presented their opening arguments in a
federal lawsuit against American Tobacco, marking one of the rare
smoker-death cases to reach the courtroom.
   ``This is not an anti-smoking case,'' said Garry Inge, who
represents Kotler's widow, Joanne Kotler. ``This is a warning case.
This is a case of informed consent.''
   ``We admit that if George Kotler knew what American Tobacco
knew, they didn't need to warn him,'' he said.
   In the last 20 years, only a handful of smoker-death lawsuits
have made it to court, as cigarette companies have spent millions
of dollars to fight accusations of liability.
   The first damages judgment came in 1988, when a federal jury in
New Jersey awarded $400,000 to Antonio Cipollone, whose wife died
of lung cancer. But an appeals court last month overturned the jury
award and ordered a new trial.
   In the Boston lawsuit, the case centers on Kotler's smoking
habits before 1966, when government warning labels were placed on
cigarette packs. Kotler, who lived in Cambridge, was 55 when he
died in 1986, but he started smoking around age 11.
   Inge told the jury that American Tobacco, a subsidiary of
American Brands Inc. in Greenwich, Conn., had information as early
as the 1930s indicating cigarettes posed a health risk. But the
company instead insisted that cigarette smoking was not harmful, he
said.
   ``American Tobacco put profits ahead of lives,'' he said. ``A
whole generation of people could have been saved.''
   Andrew Lane, representing American Tobacco, told the jury they
should consider not only whether Kotler had adequate information
but also whether it would have made any difference.
   Lane said the controversy surrounding cigarette smoking was
reported in the press during the 1950s, and the surgeon general
issued a highly publicized report in 1964 on the dangers of smoking.
   Since then, millions of Americans have quit smoking and thus
have reduced their risks for lung cancer, Lane said. But the first
time Kotler showed the ``slightest interest'' in stopping smoking
was in 1975, when he went to see a doctor because he was suffering
from chest pains, he said.
   Kotler stopped smoking for several weeks, but when his health
improved, he resumed smoking, Lane said.
   ``He smoked because he wanted to, because he liked to,'' he said.
   Lane also argued that in 1968, Kotler switched from the Pall
Mall brand, an American Tobacco product, and started smoking
cigarettes made by other companies.
   The suit originally named two other tobacco companies, Philip
Morris Cos. Inc. and Liggett Group Inc. But U.S. District Judge
Walter Skinner, who is presiding over the case, last year ruled
that the claims were only valid before 1966.

   Eddie Antar, the Crazy Eddie Inc. founder
sought by authorities since last week in connection with a
government insider-trading case, surrendered Tuesday to face
contempt charges for not answering demands he return $52 million to
the United States, authorities said.
   U.S. Marshal Arthur Borinsky said Antar was released pending
court action on the contempt charge, delayed until the judge
assigned to the case returns from vacation on Feb. 27.
   He said Antar's attorney, Jack Arseneault, called marshals to
arrange the surrender at U.S. District Court here, where the
marshals have offices.
   ``He turned himself into me,'' Borinsky said. ``He didn't say
where he had been and I really don't know where he's been.''
   Antar and other top officials of the Crazy Eddie discount
electronics chain were accused of insider trading in a lawsuit
filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The agency charged
that Antar directed a ``massive financial fraud'' to falsify the
company's income, and reaped illegal profits through the sale of
his stock at artificially inflated prices.
   The SEC won an order that $52 million be transferred from
Israeli bank accounts to a court-appointed trustee, but Antar has
not yet complied with that order, an SEC attorney said.
   U.S. District Judge Nicholas H. Politan had ordered Antar to
repatriate the money by Feb. 7, but Antar refused through his
attorney, citing his Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination.
   Politan said from the bench Feb. 7 that Antar would have to
appear in person if he was going to use the Fifth Amendment, and he
gave him until last Thursday to appear in court.
   On Thursday, Antar's attorneys said they needed an extension.
Politan then ordered Antar to appear in court on Friday, but Antar
again stayed away and the judge told marshals to ``spare no
expense'' to capture Antar on contempt charges.
   ``His surrender today more or less took care of the arrest
warrant,'' said SEC Attorney Richard E. Simpson, in Washington, D.C.
   Simpson said no bail was set because it was a civil case. No
other conditions have been set on Antar's freedom except that his
attorneys must report on his whereabouts twice a week, he said.

<HEAD>Judge Says Airline Owes Tax on Drinks Sold On Flights Over State</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR L. SRB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state judge ruled Tuesday that Wisconsin
officials could collect a 5 percent sales tax from an airline for
the drinks it sold while its jets flew over Wisconsin.
   Dane County Circuit Judge James Boll ordered the former Republic
Airlines to pay Wisconsin $90,622 in overdue sales tax for drinks
consumed on its flights over the state from 1981 to 1984.
   Boll rejected Republic's argument that a law authorizing a sales
tax on drinks consumed ``in this state'' did not mean ``over this
state.''
   The judge ruled the state had the right to impose its sale tax
on flights overhead for any airline that had some definite link to
the state, such as offices based in Wisconsin or incorporation
within the state.
   State officials could not be immediately reached for comment on
whether they would seek to impose the tax on other airlines and
seek back taxes.
   Republic Airlines, which was purchased in the mid 1980s by
Northwest Airlines, contended that applying the state sales tax to
flights violated the due process clause of the U.S. Constitution.
   Liquor consumed in ``overflights'' was not liquor consumed
``in'' Wisconsin, the airline argued.
   The airline appealed an order of the Wisconsin Tax Appeals
Commission that it owed the tax, leading to the court case.
   Before it was bought by Northwest, Republic maintained offices
in Wisconsin, had equipment and personnel located at airports in
the state and flew regularly scheduled flights in and out of
Wisconsin cities.
   Republic said it did not keep records of whether its aircraft
were in Wisconsin's air space or over another state when it sold
drinks.
   Attorney Frederic Brouner, who represented Republic, said he did
not know whether Northwest would appeal.
   Brouner called Wisconsin's attempt to collect the tax after the
fact was ``particularly onerous.''
   ``But it's a very quick, clean way to pick up revenue,'' Brouner
said. ``How many are going to be unhappy? Hey, only the vendor, and
corporations don't vote,'' he said.
   Boll said a test for determining when taxation by a state
violated the commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution was set forth
in a Supreme Court case that held a tax would be sustained if it
was applied to an activity with a ``substantial nexus'' with the
taxing state, was fairly apportioned, did not discriminate against
interstate commerce and fairly related to services provided by the
state.
   ``The (tax) department contends that the substantial nexus test
is satisfied by the fact that Republic maintains offices, equipment
and personnel in Wisconsin and is incorporated in Wisconsin,'' Boll
said. ``This court agrees.''

<HEAD>Junk Market Shows Surprising Resilience to Drexel News</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA C. MARTINEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The $200 billion junk bond market survived a day
of jitters Tuesday after the nation's biggest broker of high-yield
securities said it planned to seek refuge from creditors under
federal bankruptcy law protection.
   The market's resilience under the circumstances given its recent
steep slide surprised some analysts, who had predicted a free fall
after Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s announcement Monday that it was
seeking a merger partner and needed money.
   In announcing Tuesday that it would seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection, Drexel's parent company said it had defaulted on about
$100 million in loans and a lack of cash was threatening other
defaults.
   Nonetheless, mutual funds that invest in the high-yield
securities, those with low credit ratings or no ratings at all,
said there was no immediate rush by investors to sell.
   ``We expected an above-normal reaction and there were more calls
than usual for redemptions but by and large investors have taken it
in stride,'' said Steve Norwitz, spokesman for T. Rowe Price
Associates Inc. in Baltimore, which manages a $700 million junk
bond fund.
   Fidelity Investments in Boston, which has about $1.5 billion
invested in high-yield securities, said it had not received any
unusual redemption requests.
   ``The Drexel situation and problems have been so well documented
that it hasn't come as a shock,'' said Fidelity spokeswoman Tracey
Gordon. ``Besides, the market is not just Drexel anymore.''
   Steve Radis, spokesman for Kemper Financial Services Inc. in
Chicago, said Drexel's problems had not impacted the company's $1.4
billion high-yield fund.
   ``Drexel hasn't been supporting the secondary market for
high-yield bonds for sometime so it shouldn't impact trading of
high-yield issues,'' Radis said.
   Fund representatives said that despite recent losses in the junk
bond market, they had built up cash reserves lately and did not
expect to have to sell bonds to pay off redemptions.
   Market observers nevertheless predicted Drexel's troubles could
be damaging for market psychology, at least in the short term.
Drexel pioneered the junk bond market.
   ``Quite frankly, their very serious problems are likely to add
to the skepticism with which investors currently view junk bonds,''
said John Lonski, senior economist with Moody's Investors Service.
   Prices of most high-yield junk bonds slid two points or $20 per
$1,000 in face amount on Monday but recovered Tuesday as many
investors went bargain-hunting, traders said.
   The high-risk, high-yield corporate securities market has been
under intense pressure due to a weakening economy and an enormous
amount of corporate debt created by the merger wave of recent years.
   Among immediate investor worries are that Drexel would default
or have to liquidate its own huge inventory of junk bonds, which
would put further downward pressure on prices.
   The market already faces a scarcity of buyers. For example, many
ailing thrifts, once important buyers of junk bonds, have been
forced to get out of the junk market by federal regulators.
Insurance companies also have come under pressure to divest their
junk bond holdings.
   The average weekly new issue volume has plunged 86 percent from
the average weekly volume in 1989, according to Moody's. The
average net asset value of high-yield mutual funds is off 6 percent
since the start of the year, Lonski said.
   Meanwhile, prospects for junk-bond defaults have risen. Moody's
now projects the default rate in 1990 at 10 percent, up from 6
percent in 1989. Standard &amp; Poors forecasts a similar rate.
   Nevertheless, many junk bond analysts believe the current slump
reflects a temporary transition phase. Some contend the junk bond
market will emerge a stronger, more mature entity.
   Because of their high yields, junk bonds have remained
attractive to many investors despite the risk. Average yields now
exceed Treasury yields by nearly 7 percentage points, well above
the historical average of 4 percentage points, said Lonski. The
average yield on a cash-paying junk bond was 14.9 percent as of
Monday, compared with the yield on a 10-year Treasury note of 8.37
percent.
   ``The depth of the problems in the junk bond market has been
overdone,'' said one market researcher who asked for anonymity.
``News of the death of the junk bond market is premature.''

   Crude oil futures pulled back Tuesday while
prices of refined petroleum products moved ahead, led by a strong
advance in wholesale home heating oil.
   Gloom over the future of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., a major
operator in futures trading, permeated the markets.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the March contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the main grade of U.S. crude oil, fell 13 cents
to $21.90 per 42-gallon barrel, erasing a portion of Monday's
29-cent gain.
   The April crude contract lost 2 cents a gallon, settling at
$21.82. Contracts for later delivery posted modest increases.
   Among refined products traded on the New York Merc, No. 2
heating oil for March delivery jumped 0.90 cent to 56.85 cents a
gallon, adding to Monday's increase of 0.87 cent. The April
contract rose 0.87 cent to 56.14 cents and May added 0.64 cent to
55.25 cents.
   March wholesale unleaded gasoline, which rose 0.84 cent on
Monday, increased 0.02 cent to close at 60.42 cents a gallon. But
later contract months declined; April fell 0.45 cent to 60.96 cents
a gallon.
   Analysts said there was little news to move the energy markets
so traders were preoccupied with speculation about Drexel.
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission said Drexel's futures
subsidiary was in compliance with the regulatory agency's capital
standards and was meeting the commission's requirements governing
the segregation of customer funds.
   Drexel was said to be adjusting its positions in the energy
market, assessing its obligations to other companies and
determining how to meet them.

<HEAD>Two Union Carbide Plants Being Sold to Japanese Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSES LAKE, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union Carbide officials said Tuesday
they intend to sell two polysilicon plants to Kamatsu Electronic
Metals Co. Ltd. of Tokyo.
   The plants in Moses Lake and Washougal, Wash., employ a total of
270 people in the two communities, and had 1988 sales of about $35
million, according to Union Carbide Corp., based in Danbury, Conn.
   Terms of the impending sale were not disclosed under an
agreement between the two companies, said Harvey Cobert, a
spokesman for Union Carbide.
   No job reductions are anticipated because of the sale, said Sam
Footer, manager of the Moses Lake plant.
   The Moses Lake plant, the larger of the two plants employing 220
workers, makes polysilicon, a material used in the manufacture of
silicon wafers for computer chips and other electronics. The
Washougal plant has about 50 employees, Footer said.
   The sale is expected to ensure the long-term operation of the
polysilicon business, the companies said in a news release.
   ``In the long term we're a more viable operation with KEM
because they are a major consumer of polysilicon,'' Footer said.
``All we are is a producer.''
   So far, the two parties have signed only a letter of intent
involving the sale. The transaction must still be reviewed by the
U.S. and Japanese governments, and a final agreement must be
reached.
   The Japanese buyer is an affiliate of Komatsu Ltd., one of the
world's largest makers of construction equipment. Komatsu Ltd.
employs about 4,000 people at its various U.S. affiliates.
   Union Carbide said the sale should produce a modest after-tax
gain for the company.
   The two companies have a history of working together. The
polysilicon production at Moses Lake was based on technology Union
Carbide obtained from KEM under a 1981 licensing agreement. KEM is
presently the largest customer for the polysilicon.

   Reuters Holdings PLC, a British news agency and

   Reuters said earnings for the year ended Dec. 31 totaled $305

   Sales rose 18 percent to $2 billion from $1.69 billion.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Surge on Stock Market's Resilience</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices surged Tuesday on New York's Commodity
Exchange in reaction to the stock market's resilience amid reports
that the parent of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. would file for
federal bankruptcy protection.
   On other major commodity markets, precious metals were mixed;
sugar futures tumbled; energy futures were mixed; grains and
soybeans were mostly lower; and livestock and meat futures were
mixed.
   Copper futures settled 3 cents to 4.55 cents higher in New York
with the contract for delivery in February at $1.0545 a pound, its
highest level in about four weeks.
   The copper market has been taking its cues lately from the stock
market as a forecaster of the nation's economic climate, and
Tuesday's activity demonstrated how closely the two markets are
tied.
   Copper is used heavily by industry and in home and office
construction, so the shape of the economy is perceived as an
indicator of copper demand.
   Copper futures opened lower, reflecting expectations that the
troubles at Drexel would trigger a drop in the Dow Jones industrial
average.
   The Dow did drop in early trading, falling about 19 points
before buyers came in and pushed it up to a 5-point gain by the
close.
   Analysts said the Dow's reverse sparked a turnaround in copper
futures, which then took on a life of their own, soaring into the
close as technical buy signals were tripped.
   Randolph Donney, an analyst with the brokerage Elders Futures
Inc., said the Commerce Department's report of a 1.6 percent rise
in retail sales last month also supported the copper market.
   Precious metal futures were notably quieter Tuesday after
rallying sharply Monday amid concerns about possible supply
disruptions in South Africa.
   Gold futures finished $1.60 lower across the board on the Comex
with February at $417.60 a troy ounce; silver futures were 2.8
cents to 3.3 cents higher with March at $5.333 a troy ounce;
platinum futures settled $1.40 to $1.70 lower on the New York
Mercantile Exchange with April at $522.50 a troy ounce.
   Sugar futures fell sharply on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa
Exchange after West German statistician F.O. Licht forecast record
world production of 107.9 million metric tons for 1989-90.
   Sugar futures finished .27 cent to .38 cent lower with March at
14.56 cents a pound.
   Petroleum futures ended mixed on the New York Merc ahead of the
American Petroleum Institute's release of its weekly U.S. stocks
report.
   In the report, which was released after the close, the API said
U.S. gasoline stocks rose by 7.5 million barrels last week compared
with market expectations ranging from 1 million to 3 million
barrels.
   The Washington-based trade association said crude oil stocks
fell about 2 million barrels, as expected, while supplies of
petroleum distillates, including heating oil, rose by 870,000
barrels compared with market expectations for an increase of up to
3 million barrels.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 13 cents lower to 29
cents higher with March down 13 cents at $21.90 a barrel; heating
oil was .62 cent to .90 cent higher with March at 56.85 cents a
gallon; unleaded gasoline was .45 cent to .05 cent higher with
March at 60.42 cents a gallon.
   The wheat market led a decline in grain and soybean futures on
the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting improved crop weather for
winter wheat and South American soybeans, and signs of
disappointing foreign demand.
   Wheat settled unchanged to 4{ cents lower with March at $3.85{ a
bushel; corn was 1 cent lower to \ cent higher with March at $2.41}
a bushel; oats were unchanged to { cent higher with March at $1.39{
a bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 1} cents lower with March at
$5.64 a bushel.
   Live cattle futures fell slightly amid concerns about sluggish
retail beef movement. Hog futures were lifted by forecasts for snow
and cold temperatures moving into the Midwest and possibly slowing
the movement of hogs to market.
   Live cattle futures settled unchanged to .10 cent lower with
February at 79.57 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to
.22 cent higher with March at 82.07 cents a pound; live hogs were
.23 cent to .50 cent higher with February at 49.77 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .05 cent to .35 cent lower with February
at 49.50 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Announces 43 Percent Rise in Fourth-Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ITT Corp. reported a 43 percent jump in
fourth-quarter earnings Tuesday, attributing the performance to
stronger results in nearly all the conglomerate's business segments
except insurance.
   The company said earnings totaled $257 million or $1.79 a share
in the three months ended Dec. 31, vs. $180 million or $1.26 a
share in the year-earlier quarter.
   Fourth-quarter revenues totaled $5.1 billion vs. $5.2 billion a
year earlier, a 2 percent decline that ITT attributed to the
divestiture of its Communications Services subsidiary, flat
insurance premiums and the strength of the U.S. dollar, which
translated into lower revenues overseas.
   For the year, ITT earned $922 million, or $6.30 a share, up 13
percent from $817 million, or $5.68 a share, in 1988. Revenue
climbed 4 percent to $20.1 billion from $19.4 billion.
   ITT said 1989 results were impacted by the repurchase of 11.9
million common shares at an average price of $59.24, mainly in
connection with its newly formed Employee Stock Ownership Plan.
   ITT's businesses include automotive, defense technology,
electronics, pulp and timber, insurance, hotels, finance and
telecommunications.
   The company's electronics components was the only sector that
did not register higher operating earnings last year, due to lower
margins and volumes in semiconductors, power systems and worldwide
distribution operations, ITT said.

<HEAD>Court Refuses To Help FDIC Recover on Sindona Losses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC HUMBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state's highest court refused Tuesday to
allow the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to sue two former
associates of renegade international financier Michele Sindona for
almost $5 million.
   Sindona, who controlled the defunct Franklin National Bank of
New York, died in 1986 in an Italian prison.
   In a 6-0 decision upholding a lower court ruling, the Court of
Appeals said the FDIC wanted the court to expand state law
governing the financial liability of those working with possible
debtors.
   ``It is not for us to write such a remedy into the statute by
judicial construction,'' said the court's unsigned opinion.
   In its suit, the FDIC said Sindona's associates, Daniel Porco
and Mary Bosiack, transferred $4.87 million from some non-Franklin
stock transactions to a Swiss bank account for Sindona in 1975.
   The FDIC said it wanted the two to come up with that amount,
even though there was no allegation, noted the Court of Appeals,
that ``they benefited in any way from the transfer.''
   ``I'm very pleased,'' said Carol Roberts, a lawyer representing
Porco and Bosiack, of the Court of Appeals ruling. ``As a result of
their friendship and association with Sindona, they have been put
through the mill.''
   The FDIC, which had taken over Franklin, argued that because the
money transfer took place after the FDIC had begun legal action
against Sindona to recover funds from the bank's failure, his
former associates should be held liable for transferring any assets
on his behalf, even those that weren't connected to the bank.
   The FDIC's legal action against Sindona, begun in 1974,
culminated in 1980 with a $6 million judgment against him, said Ira
Hyams, a lawyer representing the FDIC.
   While a state trial judge ruled the FDIC could sue Porco and
Bosiack to recover the transferred money as a means of helping
settle the $6 million judgment against Sindona, a mid-level state
appeals court threw out the FDIC's lawsuit.

   Allen Paulson scored a 1-2 punch in corporate
aviation Tuesday when he acquired Chrysler Corp.'s Gulfstream
Aerospace subsidiary, which he heads, and the troubled Learjet
Corp. in separate deals.
   Paulson gained a corner on the corporate aviation market with
Gulfstream's small and medium-size jets and the sleek and speedy
Learjets.
   Chrysler's goal of concentrating on car and truck production was
enhanced with the $825 million cash it received for Gulfstream,
while Paulson's $60 million letter of intent for Learjet coincided
with the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing of Learjet's corporate
parent, Integrated Resources Inc.
   The all-cash Gulfstream deal helped ease Chrysler's $664 million
fourth-quarter loss, which included $577 million in write-offs for
auto plants it is in the process of closing. It was Chrysler's
first quarterly loss since 1982.
   Paulson remained Gulfstream chairman after he sold the company
to Chrysler in 1985 for $637 million. He teamed up with New
York-based investors Forstmann, Little &amp; Co. to buy back the
company, which Chrysler put on the block with the rest of its
Chrysler Technologies Corp. subsidiaries in December. Forstmann
will control slight less than half of Gulfstream.
   Paulson founded Gulfstream, a Savannah, Ga.-based aircraft
manufacturing company, in 1978. It has about 5,000 employees at
three plants in Georgia, Oklahoma and California.
   Paulson said owning Gulfstream again ``is like having your baby
back.''
   While Gulfstream has been profitable, analyst Charles Brady of
the New York investment firm Oppenheimer &amp; Co. said it was ``a
luxury Chrysler chose not to afford. They've got a lot of
joint-ventures going here and there. It's nice to be liquid.''
   Chrysler's bank account was bolstered last September when it
sold about half of its 21.8 percent stake in Mitsubishi Motors
Corp. for an after-tax profit of $310 million. Chrysler is
implementing a cost-cutting plan to pare $1 billion in expenses
from its $26 billion annual budget by the end of this year.
   ``The acquisition of Gulfstream never made any sense,'' said
auto industry analyst Ronald Glantz of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in
San Francisco. ``Chrysler was talking about synergy'' between the
auto and aviation businesses, he said. ``There was no synergy.''
   Chrysler still has its Electrospace Systems and Airborne Systems
for sale. Both are defense-oriented companies Chrysler wants to
shed because of a slowdown in government contracting due to the
thaw of the Cold War and political changes in Eastern Europe.
   ``I have no interest in the other Chrysler Technologies
companies. I took the crown jewels out of Chrysler Technologies,''
Paulson said at a news conference.
   Ford Motor Co. also has its Ford Aerospace subsidiary for sale.
General Motors Corp. has said it has no plans to sell its GM Hughes
Electronics Corp., which includes Hughes Aircraft Co.
   Glantz said a popular story when Chrysler bought Gulfstream was
that Chairman Lee Iacocca, prohibited by the federal government
from having a corporate jet during the years when Chrysler was
recovering from its near bankruptcy, proved the company's recovery
was complete by buying a jet-maker instead of a single jet.
   Government loan guarantees helped Chrysler survive in the early
1980s.
   When Learjet went on the market last August, Paulson suggested
that Chrysler buy it, but the board rejected his idea.
   The purchase of Wichita, Kan.-based Learjet is expected to be
completed within 60 days and also involves Forstmann, Little &amp;
Co.'s financial backing.
   Stephen Weinroth, chairman of Integrated, said the company had
entertained 12 serious bids for Learjet.
   ``The $60 million price is fair value in that we solicited those
12 bids. We felt it was the best alternative,'' said Weinroth,
declining to disclose if Paulson's $60 million bid was the highest.
   Iacocca, meanwhile, said he was happy with the price Chrysler
received for Gulfstream.
   ``Allen Paulson certainly knows Gulfstream and its strengths,''
Iacocca said.
   Paulson predicted Gulfstream would function more efficiently
without its association with Chrysler.
   Chrysler stock closed at $16.37{ on the New York Stock Exchange,
down 25 cents.

   Columbia Pictures Entertainment will pay at
least $175 million for the right to distribute Orion Entertainment
Corp. films overseas, the two companies announced.
   Columbia, which was recently acquired by Sony Corp., said it
will make a $175 million advance payment to Orion as part of the
deal.
   ``Orion definitely can earn more than the $175 million advance
if their pictures perform,'' said Alan Levine, president of
Columbia's filmed entertainment division.
   After Orion's current contracts are satisfied in 1991, Columbia
will have international distribution rights to all of Orion's
theatrical releases for the next six years, Levine said Monday. The
deal also grants rights to Orion's next 50 home video releases and
licensing rights to a number of its television features.
   ``This deal gives us a lot more pictures to distribute, which
gives us more clout internationally,'' Levine said.
   ``It's the first major deal to be undertaken by the new
chairmen, Peter Guber and Jon Peters, and indicates the emphasis
they place on the international marketplace,'' said Victoria Cohen,
vice president and secretary for Columbia.
   Distribution of Orion films has been handled by several
companies, including Warner Bros. International in Japan and 20th
Century Fox Film International in Italy.
   Orion Pictures President Bob Meyers said his company decided it
would be more efficient to select one distributor.
   Orion films include such box-office hits as ``RoboCop,''
``Platoon'' and ``Bull Durham.''

<HEAD>BANKRUPTCY FILING</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Drexel, the leading purveyor of high-risk securities known as
junk bonds, said its parent company planned to file for protection
under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code, which could give
the company a reprieve from creditors while it attempts to
stabilize and continue operating. The company defaulted on $100
million in loans Tuesday after banks refused to give it more
credit. Drexel also said a severe cash squeeze threatened to cause
more defaults. Management told employees at Drexel's New York
headquarters they would get paid Thursday but the company couldn't
guarantee anything thereafter.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>IMMEDIATE IMPACT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Few on Wall Street believe Drexel will survive. Many stock and
bond traders refused to do business with Drexel. The company's
market-makers and brokers were openly soliciting jobs on the New
York Stock Exchange floor. The firm began liquidating positions in
billions of dollars worth of goverment bonds, mortgage-backed
securities and other financial instruments; negotiated to transfer
customer accounts to Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.; withdrew as
a market maker in more than 200 over-the-counter stocks; and put
entire business units up for sale. The junk bond market showed
surprising resilience to the Drexel news and prices rose. But
market experts said the long-term implications of Drexel's demise
could severely affect confidence in all financial markets and hurt
the ability of companies to raise capital.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>WHO COULD GET HURT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Besides Drexel's own workforce of about 5,300, a broad range of
investors including mutual funds and pension funds could feel the
impact of Drexel's problems, mostly via further price declines in
the junk-bond market. Drexel's creditors, which include a broad
range of banks, also could face risk. The broader U.S. economy also
could feel the impact if a prolonged depression in the financial
markets forces interest rates higher.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BACKGROUND</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Drexel is a diversified investment house headquartered in New
York. Its principal source of revenue has been from sales of junk
bonds, high-yield debt securities of companies with credit ratings
below investment grade. That market has weakened severely in the
past year, as several major junk-financed companies have run into
trouble paying their debts.
   Drexel also has businesses in corporate finance, commodity
trading, equity trading and research, fixed-income securities such
as government and mortgage-backed bonds, and other areas.
   Once the nation's fifth-largest securities firm, Drexel has
shrunk severely, forced to restructure after a government
investigation into its trading activities. Drexel last year pleaded
guilty to six felonies and paid $650 million to the government to
settle criminal charges and overhauled its structure to settle
civil Securities and Exchange Commission charges.
   Drexel is a privately owned firm and as such is not required to
disclose earnings. But the firm has said it lost $40 million in
1989 and $167 million in 1988, vs. profits of $130 million in 1987
and $523 million in 1986.

   Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher and
Korea's trade minister signed an agreement Tuesday to create a
joint committee on commercial cooperation designed to expand trade
and reduce friction.
   The committee will develop opportunities for cooperation in
trade and investment, exchange information on mutually beneficial
development projects and exchange technical information.
   ``Our ability to address areas of potential cooperation will
lead not only to expanded trade, but reduced friction,'' Mosbacher
said after the signing with Korean Minister of Trade and Industry
Han Seung-Soo.
   ``South Korea's announcement yesterday of a $100 million award
to General Electric to provide equipment to the Ildo Power Prodject
demonstrates the long-term commitment that U.S. firms are making to
the Korean market,'' Mosbacher said.
   ``It's another brick in the strong foundation that exists for
trade expansion between our two countries.''

   Prices closed mixed on Wall Street Tuesday as
the stock market mulled a likely Chapter 11 filing by the parent of
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Stocks opened lower after the federal government announced
robust retail sales figures for January, and then took a sharp dive
after Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. said it might seek federal
bankruptcy court protection for most of the investment firm's
operations.
   Drexel said Tuesday it had defaulted on about $100 million in
loans and a lack of cash threatened other defaults.
   Prices for blue chip stocks began to come back slowly as the
market digested both developments. However, analysts, who said
traders remained in a negative mood, predicted the market would
turn downward within the next few days.
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 4.96 to 2,624.10 after
falling more than 26 points earlier in the session.
   The broader market lagged the industrials. Declining issues
outnumbered advancers by a margin of about 5 to 4 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 675 up, 804
down and 489 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 144.44 million
shares, up from 118.39 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 176.24 million shares.
   The Drexel announcement came as only a small surprise to Wall
Street, which had been aware of the investment firm's problems. But
the news cast a pall over trading as ticker services reported
Drexel developments throughout the day.
   Alfred E. Goldman, an analyst with A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. in
St. Louis, said that during more positive times, Drexel's problems
would likely not have affected the market. But against a backdrop
of economic uncertainty and the market's recent losses, traders
``will focus on obvious negatives,'' he said.
   Analysts said investors were concerned that the rest of the
securities industry would be hit by fallout from a Drexel Chapter
11 filing.
   Goldman said there were no fundamental reasons for the recovery
in blue chips. Most of the buying came from program traders,
bargain hunters and investors adjusting their positions, he said.
   After the Commerce Department's report that retail sales climbed
1.6 percent in January, Wall Street repeated what has become a
familiar process in the financial markets.
   The figures were first interpreted as a show of economic
strength, and tradrs sold the market lower, fearing the Federal
Reserve would now be unlikely to relax credit and allow interest
rates to fall.
   On closer inspection, many traders decided the surge might be a
one-time event. Big-name stocks like IBM came back, but the overall
market remained cautious.
   IBM was one of the day's few big winners, picking up 2&lsqb; to close
at 103\.
   Chrysler was off \ to 16&rsqb; after announcing its fourth-quarter
results, and as expected, said it was selling its Gulfstream
Aerospace Corp. for $825 million to a partnership of Gulfstream
Chairman Allen E. Paulson and the investment firm Forstmann, Little
&amp; Co.
   Exxon was up &lsqb; to 47\, AT&amp;T was up &rsqb; to 40, and USX advanced &lsqb;
to 35&lsqb;.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market gained $4.269 billion, or 0.13
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.30 to 182.85.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 1.03 to 382.31, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index advanced 0.94 to 331.02.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell
0.63 to 425.75. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 358.45, off 0.42.

   The captain and the first officer of an airliner
that skidded off the end of a La Guardia Airport runway crossed
signals at a crucial point just before their plane slid into the
East River, according to their testimony Tuesday.
   The transcript from the last moments of USAir Flight 5050 on
Sept. 20 shows Capt. Michael Martin saying, ``... got the
steering.''
   Martin told the National Transportation Safety Board he said:
``You've got the steering.'' His first officer, Constantine
Kleissis, said he heard Martin say: ``I've got the steering.''
   Two people died and 31 others were injured in the mishap, which
occurred on a rainswept runway late at night, after long delays.
USAir Flight 5050 ended with the plane in several pieces just off
the end of the runway.
   Both members of the crew testified that they were having trouble
with the plane's rudder prior to the accident, and that rudder is a
focus of the NTSB hearings, scheduled to last four days.
   Boeing has since redesigned the rudder control on the 737, and
the Federal Aviation Administration announced Tuesday it had
ordered airlines to make that change on existing planes.
   Officials said the FAA-ordered changes in the 737 control panel
would make it less likely that pilots or cockpit visitors might
accidentally move a rudder trim control knob that could reduce the
pilot's ability to control the plane or force an aborted takeoff,
the FAA said.
   The work would be relatively simple and cost about $820 per
plane, the FAA said. The directive would become final after a
60-day period for comment.
   The FAA order would affect 641 airplanes worldwide. Although FAA
orders do not directly apply to planes flown by foreign airlines,
they usually comply.
   The Air Line Pilots Association on Monday blamed the design of
the rudder trim control for the crash of Flight 5050.
   ``We feel the rudder trim system is what actually precipitated
the USAir accident,'' ALPA representative Tom Kraemer said Monday.

<HEAD>U-Haul Plan Would Cost Workers with Unhealthy Lifestyles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U-Haul International has a message for its
smokers and couch potatoes: Start leading a healthier lifestyle or
get lighter in the wallet.
   Starting April 1, the company will begin docking the pay of the
obese, the anorexic and the nicotine-needy by $5 per paycheck _ up
to $130 per year.
   Employees who quit smoking or get their weight under control
within two years will get refunds.
   The idea is not to harass employees who fall into those
categories but to save some of the company's $17 million-a-year
outlay for medical insurance and medical costs, executive vice
president Harry DeShong said.
   ``What we are trying to do is encourage people to maintain a
state of wellness. I suspect it's going to have a profound impact
on the organization,'' DeShong said.
   Two attorneys who specialize in labor relations said the idea
made them sick.
   ``It's ridiculous, grotesque,'' said Stanley Lubin. ``You don't
dock people for part of their pay that way. Pay is an agreed amount
of money given for an agreed amount of work. The company well may
be violating its employer-employee agreement if it docks people's
pay.''
   Lawyer Charles Santaguida said the policy was too simplistic.
   ``Many persons with weight problems, such as those linked to
diabetes, for example, are physically disabled,'' Santaguida said.
``And addiction to nicotine is considered to be a mental disability
under federal statutes, which prohibit discrimination on the basis
of either physical or mental disability.''
   Santaguida predicted the company would have to change the policy.
   DeShong said Santaguida was representing a client against U-Haul
in another labor matter.
   ``What's he going to do _ say something good about us?'' he said.
   DeShong said the plan was introduced company-wide through an
in-house newsletter last week and had met almost no opposition.
There is no organized effort to oppose implementation, he said.
   ``All of our employees are stockholders in the organization, and
the (medical) costs are such that we all suffer. Our
medical-benefits package affects 13,000 of us, and yet fewer than
150 employees comprise 80 percent of what we spend in medical
claims,'' DeShong said.
   ``Those people, and all of us, need to be more
health-conscious,'' he said. ``We're not trying to decrease the
amount of coverage. We're trying to maintain the coverage we have.
   U-Haul Chairman Edward J. ``Joe'' Shoen was overweight and
recently lost 23 pounds to fall within the guidelines, and DeShong
said he was familiar with anorexia because of the struggle of a
member of his immediate family.
   U-Haul has no policy against hiring the obese, anorexic and
smokers, but DeShong said the company had been testing for drug use
by work applicants in Arizona, where it employes 2,300, for about a
year.
   About 7 percent of the applicants either fail the urinalysis or
don't show up for the test.
   Alcohol abusers aren't included in the policy because of the
difficulty in monitoring borderline cases, but the company does
recognize alcoholism as a health threat and has programs in place
to help its workers break the addiction, DeShong said.

   Here is a chronology of major developments in the recent history
of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.:
   May 12, 1986 _ The Securities and Exchange Commission charges
Dennis Levine of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. with making $12.6
million in profits from illegal trading on inside information since
1980.
   June 5 _ Levine pleads guilty to four felonies, agrees to
cooperate with the government's investigation and surrenders $11.6
million in illicit profits and restitution.
   Nov. 14 _ Stock speculator Ivan Boesky agrees to pay a $100
million penalty to settle charges of trading on insider information
supplied by Levine in 1985 and 1986. He also agrees to cooperate
with investigators in a much broader investigation of Drexel and
its chief financier, Michael Milken.
   Early 1987 _ Drexel posts a $523 million net profit for 1986,
reaping the riches of a booming market in corporate takeovers that
it helped fuel with its innovative use of high-risk, high-interest
``junk bond'' financing.
   Feb. 20, 1987 _ Levine is sentenced to two years in prison and
fined $362,000 on charges of securities fraud, tax evasion and
perjury.
   April 23 _ Boesky pleads guilty to a single charge of conspiracy
to lie to the SEC, punishable by five years imprisonment and a
$250,000 fine.
   Dec. 18 _ Boesky is sentenced to a three-year prison term and no
fine.
   Aug. 4, 1988 _ A grand jury indicts five partners in the
investment concern Princeton-Newport Partners and a former Drexel
trader over an alleged multimillion-dollar fraud and racketeering
scheme, the first-ever racketeering charge against securities
professionals. Defendants deny wrongdoing and their attorneys call
the indictment a pressure tactic to force their cooperation in a
much larger investigation of Drexel and Milken.
   Sept. 7 _ The SEC accuses Drexel, Milken and three other
employees of violating a wide range of securities laws, most in
connection with Boesky. Drexel and the others deny the accusations.
   Nov. 30 _ Intense secret negotiations are reported between
Drexel and federal prosecutors in an attempt by the firm to avert
an indictment, particularly racketeering charges, which carry
enormous penalties.
   Dec. 7 _ Princeton-Newport Partners liquidates because of what
defense lawyers call brutal government misuse of the racketeering
laws to coerce their clients into cooperating in the Drexel
investigation.
   Dec. 21 _ Drexel agrees to plead guilty to six felonies and pay
a record $650 million in fines and restitution to settle the
biggest securities fraud probe in history. Under the settlement,
Drexel must also settle the related SEC litigation and cooperate in
the government's pursuit of other alleged wrongdoers.
   Jan. 25, 1989 _ The government files formal charges against
Drexel, publicly detailing for the first time the accusations to
which it will plead guilty. Most are related to the firm's alleged
relationship with Boesky.
   Feb. 10 _ Milken asks a federal judge to reject or modify the
plea agreement on the grounds it violates his rights by forcing
Drexel to fire him and withhold his multimillion-dollar 1988 pay.
Milken charges Drexel was coerced into signing the pact because of
the threat of racketeering charges.
   March 10 _ Drexel reportedly agrees to ban Milken for life from
the firm as part of the SEC settlement.
   March 22 _ Drexel assistant bond trader Lisa Jones is convicted
of lying to a federal grand jury during an investigation into stock
parking allegations between Drexel and Princeton-Newport Partners.
The perjury conviction is the first in the government's
investigation of Drexel.
   March 29 _ A federal grand jury indicts Milken, his brother
Lowell Milken and former Drexel trader Bruce Newberg on 98 counts
of racketeering and fraud. Potential penalties and fines under the
counts amount to more than $12 billion plus possible prison terms.
   April 7 _ Michael and Lowell Milken plead innocent to all
charges at a federal court arraignment.
   April 13 _ Drexel and the SEC announce a settlement of the civil
fraud case that subjects the firm to federal monitoring for three
years and forces it to sever ties with Michael Milken. Drexel also
announces that former SEC chief John Shad _ who was instrumental in
starting the investigation that led to the fraud charges _ would
become its chairman.
   April 18 _ Drexel announces it is selling its retail brokerage
unit, which has 2,300 employees and 1,200 brokers, partly because
of continued bad publicity over its legal troubles.
   June 15 _ Milken resigns from Drexel after 19 years and
announces formation of his own consulting firm that will not trade
any securities.
   Nov. 9 _ Drexel confirms plans to eliminate about 300 jobs in a
continuing restructuring that reduces employment to 5,300 at year's
end from a peak of 10,700 in 1988.
   Feb. 4, 1990 _ Drexel posts a loss of $40 million after taxes
for 1989, compared with a loss of $167 million in 1988.
   Feb. 12 _ Drexel says it is seeking a major investor or merger
partner because of deteriorating conditions in the junk-bond market.
   Feb. 13 _ The board of Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc., the
parent of the securities firm, agrees to file for protection from
creditors under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy law.

   The broker-dealer arm of Drexel Burnham Lambert
Group Inc. is not seeking bankruptcy court protection because
federal law bars firms that deal in securities from reorganizing
under Chapter 11.
   The parent company of onetime braggart securities firm Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors
Tuesday in what is believed to be the largest bankruptcy plunge in
securities industry history.
   Under the law, firms that underwrite stocks or bonds or handle
securities transactions with the public are not eligible for
Chapter 11, where companies can attempt reorganization without fear
of creditors' claims.
   Brokerages can seek to liquidate their holdings under Chapter 7
of the code, a move that the Drexel unit has not made. Drexel could
try to liquidate outside of bankruptcy court, though.
   ``It was thought by Congress too difficult to have a true
reorganization where you have customer claims for securities that
are in the possession of the stockbroker,'' said New York
bankruptcy attorney Richard Lieb. ``What's really needed is to
liquidate the positions.''
   But Lieb said it was rare for a securities firm to survive a
bankruptcy filing by its parent. ``I am unaware of a successful
reorganization out of bankruptcy or by other means of a stock
brokerage firm,'' he said.
   Securities firms typically hold and use securities owned by
other parties. Because firms control but don't own such assets, it
is difficult to determine who gets what in a reorganization.
   Instead, brokerage firms that go belly-up are protected under a
federal agency known as the Securities Investors Protection Corp.,
established about 10 years ago.
   The corporation appoints an independent trustee who administers
the liquidation and a federal insurance fund to protect customers
of an insolvent brokerage firm. The fund is supported by
contributions from securities firms.
   Experts compare the agency with the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., which protects commercial bank deposits.
   Typically, the net proceeds of the securities on hand are pooled
and distributed among the various holders of a security.But since
brokerages manage their holdings actively, often there isn't enough
of the security to go around.
   In the case of the shortage, the federal insurance fund can
cover at least some of the difference, bankruptcy experts said.
   There have been two bankruptcy court filings by brokerage
parents in the last year. L.F. Rothschild Holdings Inc., whose
subsidiary was severely damaged in the 1987 stock market crash,
sought Chapter 11 protection last June.
   Earlier this month, J.T. Moran Financial Corp., parent of a
3-year-old over-the-counter brokerage, filed amid a shortage of
capital and a host of legal problems.
   The largest near collapse was by E.F. Hutton &amp; Co., the retail
brokerage that faced a damaging credit downgrade after the 1987
crash before it was resuced by what is now Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc.
   Drexel's filing is believed to be the largest on record.
Bankruptcy experts could come up with no other filing that would
compare.

<TEXT>
   The Germanys agreed Tuesday to begin
formal talks on making the West German mark the official currency
of East Germany, a move that could lay the economic foundation for
reunification.
   In Ottawa, the United States, Britain and France agreed with the
Soviet Union and the two Germanys on a formula to reunite the two
states after 45 years of division.
   Under the two-stage plan, talks between East Germany and West
Germany would begin soon after East Germany holds its March 18
national elections.
   Later, the foreign ministers of the two Germanys would meet with
the foreign ministers of World War II allies _ the United States,
France, Britain and the Soviet Union _ to discuss security
questions.
   The Soviets want a neutral Germany, while the United States is
pressing for NATO membership.
   The agreement was reached at an East-West meeting on aerial
surveillance.
   Deep problems, meanwhile, still exist between the government of
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and the rickety Communist
coalition of East German Premier Hans Modrow.
   ``We still have a difficult stretch of road ahead of us before
fulfilment of German unity,'' Kohl told reporters after his meeting
with Modrow.
   Their brief summit produced an agreement to set up a joint
commission to devise a way how to make the West German mark the
official currency of both nations.
   Although the commission, which is to begin talks next week, will
deal with an important component of reunification, any system it
comes up with would not be put into effect until after Modrow's
lame-duck government is succeeded in March.
   The opposition groups want all important decisions on economic
recovery put off until after March 18.
   But some West German officials who are championing reunification
warn that East Germany's economic state is so dire that it could be
bankrupt even before the elections. Kohl said more than 85,000 East
Germans have fled to West Germany during the past six weeks.
   The West German chancellor proposed monetary union a week ago as
a means of giving East Germans confidence of immediate relief.
   But expansion of the mark into East Germany would demand
complete conversion to a market economy and would effectively deed
economic control to West Germany's central bank.
   Modrow pressed for immediate steps after March 18 to join the
German economies, but made clear that no action could be taken
before then.
   The premier instead appealed for $9 billion in ``solidarity
aid'' to tide over East Germany. West German Finance Minister Theo
Waigel said massive loans could not be made when so little detail
of East Germany's financial profile has been made public.
   Modrow claimed his nation has much to contribute to a unified
Germany, declaring that national wealth totals $850 billion, more
than half the gross national product of the wealthy West German
state that is three times larger.
   That statistic illustrated the difficulty Western officials have
in translating socialist valuations in non-convertible currency
into assessments of comparable worth in hard currency.
   In addition to Bonn's uncertainties over East Germany's
financial state, the Kohl government is reluctant to provide aid to
the Modrow government that is virtually assured of being ousted in
the elections.
   The Communists are widely distrusted because of the corruption
that was rampant under former leader Erich Honecker, who was ousted
last year.
   West German political parties are aiding the new, disorganized
and diverse groups campaigning for parliamentary seats in East
Germany. But the Western parties, singling out the most compatible
East German parties, are mainly interested in having a ready power
base in the East once unification takes place.
   West Germany's opposition Social Democrats contend that Kohl's
conservative-led government has deliberately overstated the East
German economic crisis in order to pressure the Soviet Union and
the other World War II victor powers into supporting reunification.
   Kohl, who hopes to use the reunification issue to boost his own
popularity, won assurances from Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
during a weekend summit in Moscow that the Soviets would respect
Germans' desire to live as one nation.
   Social Democratic Party leader Hans-Jochen Vogel denounced
Kohl's chief foreign policy adviser, Horst Teltschik, for telling
reporters prior to the Moscow trip that East Germany could be
insolvent ``within a few days.''
   Modrow spokesman Wolfgang Meyer denied East Germany was on the
brink of bankruptcy, and the stir created by Teltschik's forecast
appeared to put a wedge between Kohl and Modrow.
