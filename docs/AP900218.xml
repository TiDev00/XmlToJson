<HEAD>Ethiopia's President Vows Fight to End Defending Port</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mengistu Haile Mariam
pledged a ``fight to the bitter end'' to defend the northern Red
Sea port of Massawa now under attack by Eritrean rebels.
   He said in a broadcast to armed forces and police on Saturday
night that losing Massawa would lead to the fall of the 2nd Army
and secession of Eritrea, Ethiopia's northernmost province.
   ``The fall of the 2nd Army would be a heavy blow to the
Ethiopian armed forces, endanger the unity and territorial
integrity of the nation and facilitate the secession of Eritrea,''
the Marxist president said.
   It was his first comment on the fighting, which began Feb. 8
with the first offensive in more than a year by the Eritrean
People's Liberation Front.
   The Eritreans claimed the capture of Massawa two days later, one
of Ethiopia's two ports and gateway to trade involving Eritrea and
its southern neighbor, Tigre.
   The rebels said they killed or captured about 12,600 soldiers
and sank or captured nearly half the Ethiopian navy fleet of two
frigates and 12 patrol craft, as listed by the London-based
International Institute for Strategic Studies.
   The Eritreans also said they controlled the 40-mile-long road
from Massawa to Eritrea's capital, Asmara.
   Mengistu did not directly deny the rebel claim they had captured
Massawa. He appeared to rule out any negotiations with the Eritrean
rebels, however.
   ``The battle between us and the EPLF will be final and
decisive,'' Mengistu said, using the acronym for the rebel group's
name.
   ``We will either win the battle, which has been declared against
us, and destroy a coordinated conspiracy against the nation, or a
new group will emerge in the region which would opt for a peaceful
solution to the crisis.''
   The latest fighting halted relief operations. Mengistu said most
of the 90,000 tons of emergency food at the port was destroyed by
artillery fire.
   It was part of 1.1 million tons of emergency food the United
Nations hoped to deliver through Massawa in the next few months to
feed an estimated 4 million people threatened with famine, mostly
in Eritrea and Tigre.
   Mengistu made no reference to government troop casualties or
Massawa's 19,400 civilian population. The Ethiopian News Agency
said Thursday civilians had been caught in ``ferocious
house-to-house fighting.'' It said the port was bombarded from sea
and land.
   On Saturday, the Eritreans claimed in a clandestine broadcast
the Ethiopian air force had ``intermittently'' bombed Massawa since
the fighting began.
   The rebels alleged the air force also dropped chemical bombs,
killing civilians.
   Since fighting began, independent verficiation of rival claims
has not been possible. Both sides, however, normally report only
victories and each other's alleged atrocities.
   The Eritreans took up arms in 1962 to press for Eritrea's
independence. Peace talks failed late last year.

<HEAD>Leaders of Black Fraternities, Sororities Call For End to Hazing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of eight national black fraternities
and sororities announced an agreement Saturday to eliminate hazing
by banning the pledging process.
   ``We have been greatly concerned about the hazards of hazing,''
said Janet Ballard, national president of Alpha Kappa Alpha, the
nation's oldest black sorority. ``We came together here to seek
means of membership intake which would safeguard our potential
members, honor our traditions and maintain our organizational
integrity.''
   Also represented were Omega Psi Phi, Alpha Phi Alpha, Kappa
Alpha Psi and Phi Beta Sigma fraternities, and Delta Sigma Theta,
Sigma Gamma Rho and Zeta Phi Beta sororities. The groups have some
800,000 members.
   The groups passed a resolution declaring that each organization
should develop its own initiation process limited to ceremonial
rituals.
   The leaders said the resolution stemmed from their concern about
excesses of hazing at some colleges in recent years that led to
serious injuries. They said the new regulations would take effect
as soon as they could be adopted by the organizations at national
conventions this summer.

<HEAD>Judge Acquits Christian Scientist Parents in Death of Child</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Christian Scientist couple who
tried to heal their ailing 15-month-old child through prayers have
been acquitted on charges of involuntary manslaughter and child
endangerment.
   Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Robert Thomas ruled
Friday that there was insufficient evidence to convict Eliot and
Lise Glaser on the charges filed in the death of their son, Seth.
   The toddler died March 28, 1984 of meningitis following a
two-day illness.
   Under state law, parents are required to provide basic
necessities for their children, including food, clothing and
medical care. A 1976 law sponsored by the Christian Science Church,
however, exempts parents who treat children through prayer alone.
   The Glasers had sought protection from prosecution under that
provision, arguing they had taken their child to a Christian
Science healer.
   The issue was appealed to the California Supreme Court, which
ruled that the exemption applies only to the felony charge of
failure to provide basic necessities, and didn't offer immunity
from prosecution on other charges.
   ``If Christian Scientists or any other religion eschews medical
treatment in favor of prayer after their child exhibits symptoms
that are critical to their health, they have a legal obligation to
take that person to a physician,'' said the prosecutor, Deputy
District Attorney David Wells.
   Following the appeal, both sides in the case agreed to let
Thomas decide the Glasers' fate based on the transcripts of their
1985 preliminary hearing.
   The court record included the Glasers' version of what happened,
as well as the testimony of two doctors who said the child could
have been saved if his parents had brought him to a hospital.
   The court's decision turned on evidence that the child showed
brief bursts of recovery during predominant periods of high fever,
vomiting and discoloration, Wells said.
   The judge ruled that the periodic points of promise raised in
his mind a reasonable doubt as to whether the religious healing was
a wanton and grossly negligent act, Wells said.

<HEAD>Cigarette Maker Confirms Effort to Market Dakotas</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: adds 5 grafs quotes from young women</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. confirmed Saturday
it plans to test market a new cigarette named Dakota but said the
campaign would be aimed at adults who are currently smokers of
Marlboros.
   ``It is intended to appeal to that large group of adults, both
male and female, who are currently smoking Marlboro, the largest
selling brand,'' said James W. Johnston, chairman and chief
executive officer.
   The Washington Post reported in Saturday editions that a
proposed marketing plan prepared for Reynolds by Promotional
Marketing Inc. suggests Dakota be positioned to replace Marlboro as
the brand of choice among female smokers with limited educations
and between the ages of 18 and 24.
   Secretary of Health and Human Services Louis W. Sullivan,
reacting to the report, said in a statement:
   ``Smoking is increasingly becoming concentrated among Americans
with lower incomes and less education and this is simply wrong.
   ``It is especially reprehensible to lure young people into
smoking and potential lifelong nicotine addiction. And the risk
that smoking specifically poses for women adds yet another tawdry
dimension to any cigarette marketing effort which may be aimed at
younger women.''
   He noted that lung cancer has overtaken breast cancer as the
``number one cause of death among women'' and said smoking poses
special risks for pregnant women.
   Women who are 18 to 20 years old represent the only group of
Americans whose rate of smoking continues to increase.
   Sullivan said he would present more detail about smoking
problems at a hearing Tuesday before the Senate Labor and Human
Resources Committee.
   The Post said the marketing plan proposed for Dakota, set for a
test in Houston in April, targets women whose favorite pastimes
include ``cruising,'' ``partying'' and attending hot rod shows and
tractor pulls with their boy friends.
   It said documents it obtained showed the marketing plan is aimed
at young white women with no education beyond high school who are
described as ``virile females.''
   The proposed campaign, called ``Project V.F.,'' for virile
female, described the type of woman targeted as one who watches
``Roseanne'' and evening soap operas on television and who hopes to
get married in her early 20s and spend her free time ``with her
boyfriend doing whatever he is doing,'' according to the report.
   The Post said it was not clear whether R.J. Reynolds has adopted
the marketing strategy proposed to it by Promotional Marketing Inc.
   Johnston said in a statement released by Reynolds that ``the
Dakota marketing plan is focused on current adult Marlboro smokers
_ nothing more, nothing less.''
   ``The marketing plans for Dakota represent an implementation of
Reynolds' objective or regaining market share lost over the past
several years to our competitors,'' he said. ``This focus on
competitive brands is no different than that of every other
cigarette company or indeed any other consumer product company.
Different products are designed to appeal to different categories
of consumers,'' he said. ``Dakota is no different.''
   Meanwhile, Kathleen Wiebers, executive director of the South
Dakota Lung Association, noted that the state has the fifth-lowest
smoking rate in the nation at 21.1 percent of the adult population,
according to the federal Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.
   ``That means that 80 percent of South Dakotans are non-smokers
and we're pretty proud of that,'' Wiebers said.
   Reacting to the reported marketing plan for Dakota, she said:
``It's very upsetting that a tobacco company would think today's
women are that naive. How dumb do they think we are?''
   Valerie Lawruklvich, a bartender at Shooter's in Eugene, Oregon,
said the Dakota name had a certain appeal, calling it a ``cool
breezish type thing.''
   But she said getting her to change brands probably would require
more than just a name. ``At a discounted price to start with,'' she
said, ``You know `buy one pack get another one free.' Something
like that. T-shirt giveaways are a big item. I've bought certain
cigarettes just for the T-shirt this previous year. You know, if
they had like a really neat packaging type thing. A catchy name
would also help.''
   Donna Allgood, interviewed by telephone at the Whiskey Junction
bar in Minneapolis, Minn., said: ``I don't think Dakota is a real
good name, for a woman's cigarette at least. Personally speaking, I
think when you start with a `D' word, that `duh', that's too harsh.
It should be something softer.''
   At the American Legion Hall in Marysville, Tenn., Sherrie
Meisamer told a telephone interviewer she thinks the market
campaign as it was related to her was ``very disgusting.''
   ``They're trying to introduce younger age groups into the
smoking sensation,'' she said. ``I don't think that's quite right
myself. They're (young people) automatically going to buy because
they'll put on a big display for it. I'm a smoker, I have been for
several years. I don't take it as a personal affront, but I don't
think it's very agreeable that they should try to overdramatize the
younger crowd.''

   Small explosions hit two grocery stores in
this Atlanta suburb Saturday afternoon, shortly after stores were
evacuated because of telephoned bomb threats.
   Authorities said the main explosives in the bombs did not
detonate. No injuries were reported.
   ``The fuse train is all that detonated, so the effect of the
bombs was really only that of a firecracker,'' FBI spokesman Pat
Johnson said. ``It didn't do much damage except to its packaging.''
   Callers also threatened bombings at two additional grocery
stores and a fast-food outlet, police said.
   Investigators didn't believe the bombs were related to a series
of mail bombs in the South in December that killed a federal judge
and a lawyer, said Police Chief Jerry King. Agents from the FBI and
the federal bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms were helping in
the investigation.
   Police dispatcher Jill Moore said a caller telephoned a Cub
Foods and a Kroger to say bombs would explode between 1:30 and 2
p.m.
   Two other grocery stores also reported threats, Ms. Moore said,
a Big Star and a Winn-Dixie. Workers at a Kentucky Fried Chicken
outlet also reported receiving a similar threat Saturday, King said.
   About 1,200 people were evacuated from the four stores because
of the threats, officials said.
   Witnesses at the Kroger market said they were about 50 yards
from the glass store front when the bomb exploded but didn't hear
anything.
   ``We did not hear it, not at all,'' said Rhonda Bartlett, Kroger
perishables manager.
   Police Cpl. William Anastasnio, who was in the Kroger when the
bomb exploded, described it as sounding like a shotgun.
   The bomb was inside a cardboard display in an aisle, King said.

   Wind and rain triggered mudslides in California, doused crews
cleaning up the Huntington Beach oil spill and left thousands
without power Saturday, while floods in the South killed five
people and drove hundreds from their homes.
   President Bush declared six central Alabama counties a disaster
area late Saturday. Rivers across the state swelled out of their
banks, covering farmland and threatening some homes, after two days
of torrential rain that was blamed for one drowning death.
   Thunderstorms that dumped up to a foot of rain in parts of
northern Georgia caused flooding that left two dead and forced
evacuations of more than 1,000. In Mississippi, floods killed a
young brother and sister and forced at least 300 people from their
homes.
   In Southern California, tons of mud and large rocks rolled onto
Malibu Canyon Road, forcing the Highway Patrol to close the narrow,
twisting road from the ocean to the Ventura Freeway. The highway
reopened 12 hours later, said Sgt. Frank Kasko of Los Angeles
County Sheriff's Department.
   The storm knocked out power for for about 10,000 customers in
sections of Los Angeles, said Ed Freudenberg, a Department of Water
and Power spokesman.
   In Huntington Beach, some 470 workers in yellow rain slickers
and white hard hats spent 12-hour shifts in the rain cleaning up
oil washed ashore from the Feb. 7 spill from the tanker American
Trader.
   Wind and waves knocked apart a boom blocking Newport Harbor, and
boat operators struggled in rough seas to install temporary booms,
said Sgt. Andy Gonis of the Newport Beach Police Department.
   But officials said the storm did offer some benefits.
   ``We're thinking the rain might actually help by uncovering some
of the oil and tar balls that might be under the sand,'' said Tony
Kozlowski, spokesman for British Petroleum, which had chartered the
American Trader.
   Northern Californians got pelted by rain, snow and hail Saturday
as an arctic storm knocked out power to about 200,000 homes.
   ``I'm hoping they have blankets, wood-burning stoves, stuff like
that,'' Pacific Gas and Electric Co. spokesman Lyle LaFaver said
about the customers who found themselves without gas or electricity
after heavy winds and snows damaged the utility's transmission
system.
   Power had been knocked out for about 100,000 Northern
Californians when the storm first blasted through the region on
Friday. LaFaver said Butte, El Dorado, Placer and Nevada counties
remained hard-hit on Saturday, and 25,000 could still be without
service on Sunday.
   Most of the communities have between two and three feet of snow.
Many also lost telephone service because of the storm.
   Blizzard conditions kept more than 80 miles of Interstate 80
shut between Applegate and the Nevada state line for much of
Saturday, the Highway Patrol reported. The highway reopened
Saturday night.
   More than 20,000 electric customers in central Illinois remained
without service Saturday as two utilities had extra crews working
to restore power. More than 57,000 customers suffered outages when
a midweek storm blanketed much of nothern and central Illinois with
snow and ice.
   In the usually mild, drizzly Seattle area, the snow that arrived
Friday night tapered off by midday Saturday, giving way to clear
skies and bright sunshine.
   Snow lingered in southwest Washington and a freeze warning was
issued for northwest Washington as arctic air was expected to pour
south out of British Columbia.
   The Olympia area, recovering from a Wednesday night storm,
received an additional 10 inches early Saturday, while Spokane had
5 inches.
   At Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, crews worked all night
to keep the main runway open and only a few flights were delayed,
said airport supervisor Lynette McNamara.
   ``The airport is in good condition. It's getting here (from
other airports affected by bad weather) that seems to be the
problem,'' she said.
   Water levels began dropping in two Georgia towns hard-hit by
floods, but weather forecasters warned of more flooding through
Sunday as rivers crest. More rain was expected in some areas.
   Police in the Atlanta suburb of Smyrna on Saturday found the
body of Lawrence DeVoe, 69, in a car in the flooded driveway of the
Oakdale Moose Lodge.
   Joe Crowe, 43, drowned Friday in Trion after he was swept away
by flood waters when his car stalled.
   The flooding followed thunderstorms that dumped up to 12 inches
of rain in some parts of north Georgia, pushing rivers and creeks
over their banks.
   About 550 people fled their homes in Fannin County after the
Toccoa River was over its banks. In Trion, authorities said as many
as 1,000 people evacuated after 10 inches of rain fell in about 15
hours, pushing the Chattooga River out of its banks and over a dam.
   Extensive flooding of Alabama's lowlands was reported all along
the Coosa, Black Warrior and Tallapoosa rivers.
   Authorities in Cherokee County said Mary E. Stallings, 76, was
killed trying to walk across a swollen stream that blocked the road.
   A spokesman for Gov. Hunt, Terry Abbott, said Saturday that
President Bush had declared a federal disaster area in central
Alabama that included Bibb, Greene, Russell, Shelby, Talladega and
Tuscaloosa counties.
   Carl Suchocki, a spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, said the declaration made individuals eligible for federal
assistance for damages from several violent storms that began Feb.
3.
   In Mississippi, a 7-year-old girl and her 4-year-old brother
died after the vehicle they were riding in with their grandmother
and mother got stuck in a flood along the Bogue Chitto River on
Friday night.
   Katrina Hughes had been holding her grandmother's hand but
currents swept her away and she drowned, Pike County Coroner Bennie
Hunt said. Hunt said Kenneth Ray Hughes died Saturday morning of
hypothermia.

   A top aide to former Gov. Edmund G. ``Jerry''
Brown who disappeared the day the FBI disclosed he admitted
laundering cash was found in a Las Vegas hotel, apparently
suffering a drug overdose, police said.
   Richard T. Silberman, 60, was in serious but stable condition at
University Medical Center of Southern Nevada, hospital spokesman
Dale Pugh said.
   San Diego police detectives working with Las Vegas police found
Silberman at about 5:30 p.m. Saturday at the Las Vegas Hilton,
where he had registered under his own name, San Diego police Sgt.
Jim Clear said.
   Pugh declined to say why Silberman was hospitalized, but Clear
said he apparently was suffering a drug overdose.
   Silberman's wife, county Supervisor Susan Golding, notified
authorities Friday that her husband was missing after he failed to
return home Thursday night.
   Silberman _ chief of staff to Brown, who was governor from 1975
to 1982 _ faces trial along with reputed San Diego mobster Chris
Petti and three others on charges they laundered money that an FBI
undercover agent presented to them as cocaine trafficking profits.
   Silberman was arrested April 7, 1989, as he left a hotel room
where he had talked with the undercover agent. The conversation was
videotaped.
   The arrest came at the end of a 2{-year undercover operation
that included the extensive use of wiretaps and other eavesdropping
devices.
   Silberman has been free on a $500,000 surety bond that required
him to stay in California.
   He disappeared the day the FBI released a report saying he
admitted accepting $100,000 in one transaction and $200,000 in a
second from the undercover agent and directed four others to
launder it.
   The report said Silberman told FBI agents he knew the deals were
``stupid,'' but he wanted the money to help save his troubled
gold-mining company, Yuba Natural Resources Inc.
   The report was made public after a federal appellate court
turned down requests by Silberman's lawyers to keep it secret.

<HEAD>News Media: Conservatives to Hold Majority</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY THORSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Major news media declared that the governing
conservative party would hold its majority in the lower house of
Parliament, based on computer projections from Sunday's national
election.
   If final returns bore out the projections, issued less then four
hours after the polls closed, the Liberal Democratic Party could
claim it had been pardoned for a widespread influence-buying
scandal that cut into its popularity and played a part in two prime
ministers resigning last year.
   Kyodo News Service and NHK, the public-supported Japan
Broadcasting Corp., said their computer projections showed the
governing party keeping its majority.
   Liberal Democratic leaders also declared they believed the party
would hold its majority, though final official returns were not
expected until Monday afternoon.
   Party Secretary-General Ichiro Ozawa told reporters he believed
the party would hold at least a bare majority of 257 seats in the
512-seat lower house, which has power to name the prime minister
and pass the budget without assent of the upper house.
   Another party official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
he was confident of reaching 265 seats, and hoped for 270 to give a
vote of confidence to Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and enough power
to deal with the opposition, which controls the upper house. The
party currently holds 295 seats.
   ``I was concerned that the party would barely win a majority,
and internal struggle would hinder the party's ability to bargain
with the opposition,'' the official said.
   Early unofficial returns showed the Liberal Democrats, who have
held power since 1955 when the party was formed, losing some of
their seats but holding a lead over the combined opposition.
   Ozawa said it was clear that four of the party's incumbents had
lost in farm constituencies in northern Japan.
   ``Of course we wanted to defend our dominance in those
constituencies, but under the severe situation we have to accept
defeats,'' the No. 2 party figure told reporters at party election
headquarters.
   About 71 percent of the 90.5 million eligible voters _ a high
turnout identical to that in the 1986 election _ cast ballots at
more than 50,000 polling stations nationwide.
   Forecasts by NHK, based on early partial counts, said the
governing Liberal Democrats held 185 seats and the combined
opposition 147 shortly after 10 p.m., four hours after the polls
closed.
   Kaifu, head of the Liberal Democrats, and Socialist Chairwoman
Takako Doi, who could become Japan's first woman prime minister if
the opposition scores an upset victory, each said they believed
their sides would win.

   An explosion apparently caused by a gas
leak tore through a motel Sunday morning, setting off a fire and
killing at least three people, authorities said.
   The victims of the 5:30 a.m. blast at the Super 8 Motel were not
immediately identified. Ten other people were injured, none
seriously, authorities said.
   ``The whole front of the building had been blown out and was
engulfed in flames,'' said Fire Chief Gary Hawbaker. ``We had
debris blown out onto the highway. It was quite a powerful
explosion.'' The motel is three stories tall.
   He said firefighters were searching for two people who were not
accounted for. Part of the problem of checking on all the guests
was that some of the motel's records were burned, he said.
   Some guests reported smelling gas before the explosion.
   ``I had just gotten up to go to the bathroom and had come back
and my wife said, `Don't you smell the gas?''' said Neal Woodrick,
60, of Trenton, N.J. ``And then it happened.''
   ``It sounded just like a bomb had gone off _ boom,'' said his
wife, Joan Woodrick, 58. She said guests evacuated the motel in a
``very orderly'' manner.
   Ron Peterson, regional manager for Super 8 Management Inc., said
motel employees were working with the Red Cross ``to get the people
and their luggage straightened out.''
   ``There is going to be a lot of turmoil here until we can get
this situation turned around,'' he said.
   Hawbaker said the explosion was unrelated to a bomb blast last
December that injured Washington County Circuit Judge John P.
Corderman.
   ``I feel very comfortable ruling out bombs,'' Hawbaker said.
``Initial reports indicate that it was some kind of a gas leak.''
   A dispatcher at the Washington County Fire and Rescue Service
said at least 10 people were taken Washington County Hospital for
treatment of what were described as minor injuries.
   Officials with the Maryland state fire marshal's office and four
fire companies were on the scene.
   Traffic was diverted away from the area.
   Hagerstown is in western Maryland about 65 miles northwest of
Baltimore.

   A Zambian air force transport plane
crashed while trying to land at Lusaka's international airport,
killing all 28 people aboard, the government said Sunday.
   Defense Secretary Alex Shapi said the Canadian-built Buffalo
transporter was on a routine flight from Mbala in northern Zambia
late Saturday when it crashed, scattering wreckage over a wide area
near the airport.
   The dead were identified only as 14 air force personnel, 11
civilians, one army officer and two national service staff.
   Shapi refused to speculate on the cause of the crash, saying an
investigation would be conducted. Military planes routinely use the
civil airport in Zambia.

   Hamid Mohamed Hamad became the second man sentenced to death for
hashish trafficking since the military government came to power
June 30. Saturday night's TV report did not say how much of the
drug he sold.
   The military courts also have handed out death sentences to four
people convicted of trading currency on the black market and to a
man found guilty of leading a strike by doctors in Sudan in August.
   When it came to power, Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan el-Bashir's
government decreed harsh criminal laws. The death sentences handed
out under those laws have been sharply criticized by Arab and
Western nations.

<HEAD>Report Experts Call for Law Limiting Families to Four Children</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Population experts alarmed by the lack of
response to birth control programs are urging the government to
pass a law limiting families to four children, an independent
newspaper reported Sunday.
   The Nigerian Guardian said official projections based on an
estimated national average of every woman bearing seven children
indicate it will take at least 20 years before any population
policy makes an impact on the nation's 3.4 percent growth rate.
   Nigeria's population of 115 million is the largest in Africa and
one of the fastest growing in the world. Officials project that it
could reach 165 million within a decade.
   ``The nation's population is difficult to control because the
momentum for the present growth rate is already established,'' the
newspaper quoted Dr. A.B. Sulaiman as saying.
   Sulaiman, the architect of Nigeria's birth control program and
executive director of its Planned Parenthood Federation, said he
believed there was a national desire to reduce population growth,
but doubted it could succeed while at least 50 percent of the
population is young and sexually active.
   Worried population experts have sent a report to the government
urging enactment of a law to force people to limit their families
to four children, the newspaper reported without identifying the
experts.
   It said they urged the government to abandon its sensitivity to
cultural issues that frown on birth control and to concentrate on
freeing the next generation from poverty, hunger, disease, social
disorder, mass suicides and other byproducts of over-population.
   Traditions and polygamy tolerated culturally and by the Moslem
religion of many Nigerians encourage large families. They are
considered a sign of a man's wealth and virility and also provide
free labor for family holdings in the agriculture-based countryside.
   Birth control now can ``prevent the situation from getting worse
for the next generation and ensure that youth embrace family
planning as a social ethic so that past mistakes are not
perpetuated,'' Sulaiman said.
   But he concluded that only wars, earthquakes, floods, famine,
epidemics and other disasters could reduce the population or stall
its frightening growth rate before the year 2010.

   Several unknown pieces by composer
Edward Elgar, whose ``Pomp and Circumstance'' is a fixture at U.S.
graduation ceremonies, have been discovered, but they are minor
works, a local writer said.
   ``There is no great symphony I'm afraid, no great works of
art,'' William Mitchell said Saturday. He said he acquired the
manuscripts last year.
   The early pieces were discovered in Giggleswick, a Yorkshire
town the composer frequently visited. They include a trio for
violin, piano and cello, an arrangement of the Yorkshire ballad
``Clapham Town End,'' and a setting of a poem.
   ``Clapham Town End'' is a song about two dealers ``trying to
flog a dead horse on the other _ or one a dead horse and the other
a dying one,'' Mitchell said.
   Elgar, who died in 1934, is known for his later compositions
such as ``The Dream of Gerontius'' and ``Land of Hope and Glory.''

<HEAD>Plan To Split Largest Appeals Court Divides Industry,
Environmentalists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environmental and industry groups are on
opposite sides of a dispute over whether to break up the nation's
largest appeals court, which exercises authority across nine states
and far into the Pacific.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, with jurisdiction over
more than 40 million Americans from its base in San Francisco, is
frequently the arbiter of major environmental cases.
   ``This huge circuit requires too much travel and has too many
judges handing down too many opinions that breed inconsistency and
lack of uniformity,'' says Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash.
   Joined by eight other senators, Gorton is proposing to cut the
9th Circuit into two parts and establish a new appeals circuit
based in Seattle.
   The timber industry supports Gorton's plan, while
environmentalists wince at the notion of taking jurisdiction over
major lawsuits out of California and moving it to timber country.
   Similarly, Pacific Northwest senators find themselves at odds
with Californians.
   ``The real criticism of the bill supporters is aimed at the
outcome of some of the environmental litigation and what the bill
sponsors would do is a backdoor way of influencing these
decisions,'' says Nan Aron, head of the Alliance for Justice, a
court-watching group based in the nation's capital.
   Courtroom dueling between timber companies and environmentalists
has focused on the northern spotted owl. The 2-pound bird nests
exclusively in the Douglas fir trees of ``old growth'' forests in
the Pacific Northwest.
   Environmentalists say more cutting could threaten the spotted
owl _ to say nothing of the forests themselves _ with extinction.
   Portland, Ore., attorney Mark Rutzick, an outspoken advocate of
the timber industry, says creating a Seattle-based appeals court
``would result in decisions based on a sounder understanding of the
circumstances.''
   ``There's a world of difference between the California life
experience and life in a small, timber-dependent community in
Oregon or Washington,'' he says. ``Availability of trees for a
sawmill to process is life or death for a small town.''
   Such views have caused environmental groups including the Sierra
Club and the National Wildlife Federation to head in an opposite
direction.
   Vic Sher, a Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund attorney based in
Seattle, takes issue with ``the notion that federal courts of
appeals should be bastions of provincialism.''
   ``One of the reasons for having the court of appeals is to
insure the removal of the court from the immediate concerns of the
community,'' he says.
   But he doubted that merely moving appeals of environmental cases
northward would automatically change the outcome. ``We bring good
cases,'' he said. ``We assume the court will continue to decide on
the law.''
   Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., however, said in a Dec. 5 letter to
National Wildlife Federation chief Jay D. Hair that he believes the
outcome of cases could change under the proposed new system.
   ``This legislation is not in the best interests of judicial
administration and it could also undercut the effectiveness of
important decisions protecting the environment in the western
United States,'' Wilson said.
   Aides to Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., say he plans to be on
hand March 6 to oppose the bill at a hearing before a Senate
Judiciary Committee panel headed by Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala.
   Gorton's bill would leave Arizona, California and Nevada in
smaller 9th Circuit. It would create a new 12th Circuit, with
jurisdiction over Alaska, Idaho, Hawaii, Montana, Oregon and
Washington, as well as Guam and the Northern Marianas thousands of
miles away in the Pacific.
   With California senators opposed, efforts to restructure the
court are likely to face tough sledding this year.
   Bill proponents argue that the size of the 9th Circuit requires
too much travel on the part of lawyers. Critics counter that court
papers may be filed locally in all the states in the circuit, and
they say there would be little difference between traveling to San
Francisco or Seattle for lawyers from Montana or Alaska.
   Proponents also say that because of the court's size it is
inefficient. Critics say it already has divided itself into two
administrative units and now is a model of efficiency.
   Bill opponents note that the circuit's active judges are
unanimous in opposing the bill. Supporters point to other judges
who favor it.
   Timber lobbyists, meanwhile, say they have not been active in
pushing for the legislation. They do make clear, however, that the
industry is smiling on the idea.
   ``It seems to us,'' says William Murray, American Forest
Resource Alliance counsel, ``that certainly Senator Gorton and the
other senators have identified legitimate concerns with regard to
judicial administration in the 9th Circuit, which I think has been
regarded for some time as being overlarge and overworked.''

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Sunday grounded all 13
Airbus-320s operating with state-owned Indian Airlines pending an
investigation into a crash last week that killed 91 people, news
reports said.
   The 150-seat plane, the only passenger aircraft with fully
computerized flight control capabilities, will be grounded until
all aspects of its operation are investigated, the United News of
India said, citing unidentified officials.
   The news agency said pilots had criticized the use of the plane
by Indian Airlines because its sophisticated technology required
commensurate ground maintenance, which was not available in India.
   On Wednesday, a 3-month-old Airbus-320 crashed while it was
coming in to land at Bangalore airport, killing 91 of the 146
people on board.
   Indian Airlines, which flies to 73 cities in India and nine
nearby countries, placed an order for 31 Airbus-320s last year. It
has received 14 of the planes, each costing $38 million.
   The cause of Wednesday's crash remained a mystery. The weather
was clear and the pilot had not reported any emergency.
   The aircraft, on a scheduled flight from Bombay, grazed a clump
of trees short of the runway, crashed and caught fire. Newspapers
have said the pilot tried to manually take over the plane's
computer control minutes before the landing.
   An Indian Airlines spokesman said newspaper reports were
incorrect and that nothing could be said until inquiries were
completed.
   Both the pilot and the co-pilot died in the crash, and the
inquiry is centering on the cockpit voice recorder and fight data
recorder.
   The crash was only the second involving the Airbus-320, which is
manufactured by Airbus Industrie, a European consortium based in
Toulouse, France. In the previous crash, at an air show in eastern
France in June 1988, three people were killed and 50 were injured.
   In that accident, the company blamed pilot error before
investigations were completed. The pilot, Michel Asseline, told
investigators that the engines responded late to efforts to gain
altitude.
   But Airbus Industrie denied there were any problems with the
plane and the French government suspended Asseline's pilot's
license for eight years.
   The twin-engined, narrow-bodied jet consumes 40 percent less
fuel than similar planes and has been making inroads into the
medium-range market, long dominated by Boeing and McDonnell
Douglas. Airbus Industrie says it is the fastest selling plane in
aircraft history.

   The Colombo correspondent for a
Rome-based news agency was taken from his home by six armed men,
and family members said Sunday they were told he was being held by
the army for questioning.
   Police sources said the reporter, 33-year-old Richard de Zoysa,
was removed from his home in the Welikade suburb of the capital
Saturday morning by six men carrying guns. Five were dressed as
civilians, and one as a policeman, they said.
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, denied the
reporter had been arrested and said they suspected the journalist
was abducted by Sinhalese militants fighting to overthrow the
government.
   De Zoysa, a Sinhalese, works for the Inter Press Service, which
is based in Rome and has correspondents in many capitals around the
world. He had also written several articles on the Sinhalese
uprising for local newspapers.
   On Sunday, members of de Zoysa's family said Maj. Gen. Cecil
Waidyaratne, the army commander for the Colombo area, told them the
reporter was being held for questioning at an army detention camp.
They said he refused to elaborate.
   Sinhalese extremists of the People's Liberation Front have been
accused of killing three employees of the state-owned television
network last year.
   At least 6,000 people have been killed by guerrillas and
authorities since the Sinhalese uprising began in 1987.
   The militants claim the government has made too many concessions
to Tamil militants fighting for more autonomy in northern and
eastern Sri Lanka.

<TEXT>
   Right-wing Russian nationalists staged a venomous
rally Sunday to complain about President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
reforms, warming U.S.-Soviet relations and the growing nationalism
in non-Russian republics.
   The 2,000 people gathered in the deep snow near Soviet TV's
1,600-foot-tall transmission tower also heard speakers accuse
Gorbachev of being power-hungry and plunging the Soviet Union into
poverty and misery.
   Ironically, the right-wing groups were taking advantage of
Gorbachev's glasnost policy of greater openness to counter liberal
measures they believe are hurting the Russians, the country's
dominant ethnic population.
   The harshest attack on Gorbachev came from Boris Unko of the
United Front of Workers of Russia, a group fighting Gorbachev's
market-oriented economic reforms and unhappy about the nationalism
in non-Russian republics.
   Unko told the crowd that the people initially supported
perestroika, Gorbachev's reform program, but that ``today we see
what we got from that.''
   Among the evils wrought by Gorbachev's reforms, Unko said, were
rock music, ``modernism and pornography,'' ``insults'' to heroes of
the Bolshevik Revolution and World War II and others ``who built
socialist society.'' He said Gorbachev had sold out to the elite
and forgotten about the working class.
   ``Today we very much want to understand: Is that a result of
some kind of mistake or unfortunate circumstances?'' Unko demanded.
   He said Gorbachev is trying to become a dictator, adding that
the Soviet leader should have known his reforms would bring more
harm than good.
   ``Any grandmother could have predicted the consequences of such
a course. But you keep different company, the elite,
property-holders. You make friends with President-murderer Bush,
also a fighter for democracy who spilled blood in much-suffering
Panama,'' Unko said.
   Although ethnic Russians, including Gorbachev, dominate the
Soviet leadership, Russian nationalists feel forsaken by the
Kremlin and its economic and political liberalization and adhere to
orthodox socialism.
   Russians also feel threatened by other nationalities who have
been speaking out against what they see as imperialistic policies
that have encroached on local languages and cultures and plundered
natural resources.
   Sunday's rally reflected the increasing polarization that has
occurred as the Soviet Union's more than 100 ethnic groups vent
long pent-up grievances. Russian nationalists have become
particularly vocal during the campaign for March 4 elections to the
republic's legislature.
   Small knots of people huddled at the demonstration to talk
politics and buy leaflets and newspapers published by Russian
nationalist groups.
   One written statement described a purported plot to seize power
being hatched by liberal parliamentarians in the Inter-Regional
Group, whose leaders included Russian populist Boris N. Yeltsin.
   The statement, signed by a patriotic group called ``Russia,''
said the coup would occur in the second half of March and that the
instigators were hording hundreds of train wagons of consumer goods
for distribution after they take power.
   Banners resting against a fence attacked Gorbachev. They read,
``Mikhail is the Creator of Vileness and Desolation'' and
``Gorbachev: Answer for the Breakdown of the Economy.''
   One banner held by protesters blasted Gorbachev's proposal, made
at a meeting of the Communist Party Central Committee two weeks
ago, to strengthen the presidency, a post he now holds.
   ``No Fascism under the Guise of a Presidency,'' the poster read.
   A candidate in the March 4 elections, Alexander I. Dorpayev,
accused economic reformers of purposely leading the economy to
collapse so they could impose capitalism to benefit ``underground
millionaires.''
   Speakers obliquely criticized Soviet Jews who emigrate, and one
woman held a poster attacking Jews.
   ``Russians: Purge the National Staff of Doctors, Medicine, of
Zionist-Murderer-Butcherers,'' her poster read.

   Unlike U.S. elections with their mechanized and
curtained booths, in Japan it's all done by hand at rows of tables
with only a hint of privacy.
   As a result, many a ballot was cast in Sunday's parliamentary
elections after furtive glances at neighbors or the outright
comparing of notes.
   A young couple standing side-by-side at desks separated only by
low partitions in one suburban polling center discussed the merits
of each candidate in their district before agreeing on a mutually
acceptable member of the opposition Socialist Party.
   An elderly woman nearby filled in a ballot for her husband, who
was cradling their grandson.
   Voters outside gathered for one final look at photographs of the
candidates on campaign posters, which had to conform to government
size regulations to be pasted on the center's official billboard.
   One housewife said she went to the center undecided but chose a
Liberal Democrat after examining his poster.
   ``He looked the most respectable of the bunch,'' she said.
   The election for the 512 seats in the powerful lower house of
Japan's bicameral Parliament was seen as a crucial test of whether
scandals and unpopular policies would end the Liberal Democrats'
more than three decades of control over the government.
   More than 90 million people age 20 or older were eligible to
vote, and officials said about 73 percent cast ballots. Those
unable to pencil in their vote on the light green ballots because
of physical disability, illiteracy or other reason were able to
designate proxies to vote for them.
   The counting of the votes began immediately after most centers
closed at 6 p.m., and the first ``assured winner'' based on
computer projections was declared just 90 minutes later on publicly
supported television.
   But difficulties were expected in counting the handwritten
votes, which could be nullified for misspellings or unnecessary
markings. And because voters have been known to write only the
family name of their chosen candidate, problems also were expected
in one district where three Satos were in the running and in
another that had three Kogas.
   In a separate ballot Sunday, a national referendum was held on
the performance of eight of Japan's 15 Supreme Court judges. The
eight took their seats after the last such poll, during elections
for both houses of Parliament in 1986.
   Spaces were provided for voters to mark if they thought any of
the Cabinet-appointed justices should be removed.
   The system was written into the constitution by U.S.-led
occupation forces after World War II to provide a safeguard against
unpopular appointees, but it has been criticized as ineffective.
   No justice has resigned because of a poor rating, and critics
say many voters do not know the backgrounds of the judges they are
rating well enough to render a fair decision.
   That charge was reflected by the young wife at the suburban
polling center, who held out her ballot to her husband and asked:
``Do you know any of these people?''

<HEAD>Internal Revenue: From Bumbling Bureaucrats to Political Vendettas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Horror stories abound about the federal agency
everyone loves to hate: the Internal Revenue Service.
   One of the earliest dates to 1925, when the nation's chief
tax-collection agency _ then the Bureau of Internal Revenue _ and
its parent Treasury Department responded to a senator's allegations
of widespread corruption by slapping him with a $10.8 million bill
for back taxes.
   There is considerable evidence that the IRS sometimes has been
used against political enemies, especially during the Franklin D.
Roosevelt, Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon administrations. Just last
year a congressional subcommittee held hearings on allegations of
outright fraud and bribery involving senior IRS officials.
   Then there are the almost-comical examples of a bumbling
bureaucracy _ the wrongful seizure of children's bank accounts and
the expenditure of huge amounts of time and money to recover a few
dollars in back taxes.
   These and other stories are recounted by David Burnham in ``A
Law Unto Itself: Power, Politics and the IRS.''
   With its sprawling bureaucracy of 125,000 employees, an
unpopular task and a seeming susceptibility to shooting itself in
the foot, the IRS is an easy target.
   But Burnham rejects the excuse that there are bound to be
occasional foulups in any organization so big.
   ``The rapid turnover at the very top of the IRS, the recruitment
of most of its top administrators from within and the almost
complete lack of outside review make the agency astonishingly
consistent in the often erratic and hard-nosed way it deals with
the American people,'' Burnham writes.
   Only two IRS officials _ the commissioner and the chief counsel
_ are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate,
Burnham notes, and since World War II the average tenure of the
commissioner has been 37 months. Stepping into that leadership
vacuum, he contends, is ``a small unknown cadre of senior civil
servants who have spent their entire careers slowly inching up the
agency's promotion ladder.''
   For the most part, Burnham says, these career officials are
conservatives with a ``suspicious, almost paranoid, mind-set.'' All
too often, he adds, the agency's power is brought to bear against
those whose chief crime is that they ``offend the sensibilities of
an agency bureaucrat.''
   Burnham blames Congress for many IRS problems. He says the House
and Senate shirk their responsibility to oversee the IRS for fear
that a crackdown could deter collection of the taxes that finance
the programs that lawmakers love.
   The IRS is hampered by an organizational structure and an
outmoded computer system that were dictated by Congress to disperse
the agency's authority in the wake of a major 1950s scandal and
Watergate abuses.
   A former New York Times reporter, Burnham blames the news media
for failing to cover the IRS as thoroughly as it does, say, the
Justice Department. And he criticizes academics for showing far
more interest in the tax laws than how they are administered.
   Burnham acknowledges that the IRS does its basic job well,
collecting 90 cents of every tax dollar owed, about $1 trillion a
year. Except for writing that he talked to dozens of IRS employees
whose integrity seemed beyond question, he has little else that is
good to say about the agency.
   Even the praise for workers' integrity is tempered by a note
that many ``expressed such despair about the ability of the agency
to function in a fair way that their will to perform a decent day's
work appeared to have been seriously undermined.''
   The IRS has declined to comment on the book. But even as the
book was making its appearance, the IRS was acknowledging publicly
that ``we have made mistakes and we have identified systemic
weaknesses and areas that can and should be improved.''
   IRS Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg Jr. made those statements in a
report on how the agency is responding to allegations, including
some made by Burnham and others by investigators for a House
subcommittee, about ethical lapses among some senior officials.
   If most Americans are unaware of some of the problems of the
IRS, they probably are familiar with what Burnham views as a root
cause.
   ``In a situation where both the enforcers and the subjects of
enforcement are unable to fathom the intent of the law,'' Burnham
writes, ``arbitrary and capricious actions are inevitable. ...
   ``It is hard to imagine how reforms can be made within the
administrative process until Congress and the public understand
that the agency's genuine flaws begin with truly impossible tax
laws,'' he concludes.

   This year's winner of the 10th annual
Strange Music Festival was a hosaphone. Runner-up honors went to a
harp that came from from the broad side of a barn. Third place went
to the humongaphonium.
   The festival began in 1980 at Carter Caves State Resort Park and
was intended originally to celebrate the jaw harp. ``But we decided
that was too limited, so the thing just started getting a whole lot
bigger,'' said festival co-founder Dick Albin, a Nashville, Tenn.,
humorist.
   Albin said the festival has attracted musicians from Japan,
Israel, Canada and West Virginia. Previous winners include a baby's
bottom and a dog's tail.
   ``This brings out latent musical abilities,'' said John P.
Tierney, park naturalist and the other co-founder.
   More than 100 people squeezed into the meeting room at the park
lodge to watch six musicians demonstrate their creations. Prizes
went to the instruments that were the most unusual and the best
able to play a recognizable tune.
   Dick Mansfield, a folk musician from Mansfield, Ohio, won what
he called a hosaphone. He took the mouthpiece from a trumpet and
stuck it into a hose from his mother's washing machine. Twirling
one end of the hose, he played taps.
   ``I came up with this 30 years ago but never had a place to play
it,'' Mansfield said.
   Robert Toothman of South Point, Ohio, came in second with his
board harp, a 5-foot-4 piece of lumber from the side of an old barn
that he fitted with frets and banjo strings.
   Third-place went to J.C. Ramey of Olive Hill, a former
elementary school principal who said he spent a year developing his
entry, which he called a gigantic, compressed-air, PVC
humongaphonium.
   It was a long piece of plastic pipe with a slide in one end and
an air compressor on the other. With the help of two assistants, he
played ``The Ol' Gray Mare.''
   Tierney said this year's entries werent as strange as some he'd
seen.
   ``We had a very bizarre instrument a while back,'' he said.
``This couple had a baby, and they figured out that if they patted
him, he'd gurgle, so they played that.''
   Another contestant tied a stick to a dog's wagging tail so the
animal could play the drums. ``Visually it was strange,'' Tierney
said, ``but musically, it was lacking something.''

   Poor George Washington. In six
New Jersey communities that took his name as their own, not a
single parade or commemoration celebrated the 258th anniversary of
his birth.
   ``I guess I'm glad we're not planning anything,'' said Betty
Bartkovsky, secretary to the mayor of Washington Township in Morris
County. ``If we were doing anything, I'd probably have to come to
work Monday.''
   New Jersey has five separate communities named Washington
Township and one called Washington Borough. Each City Hall has its
own tale of confusion and bureaucratic chaos caused by the
proliferation of Washingtons.
   ``I sometimes wonder why anyone would name their town after
Washington with five others already there,'' said Marjorie Fox,
township clerk in Gloucester County's version, the largest of the
six with 35,000 residents. ``We get all the wrong death
certificates, birth certificates, tax payments. It's a real
problem.''
   One of the communities took steps to ease the confusion.
Washington Borough, a one-square-mile Warren County enclave,
seceded from Washington Township to distinguish itself from other
Washingtons.
   Washington knew his way around New Jersey. He led the
Continental Army through New Jersey several times during the
Revolutionary War, fighting the British at Trenton, Monmouth and
Princeton. He also briefly made his headquarters in Essex County
and then in Morristown.
   One place did remember its roots over the holiday weekend:
Washington's Crossing State Park in Mercer County, which marks the
spot where the general landed in New Jersey after his Christmas Eve
crossing of the Delaware River in 1776.
   ``We're having an open house 18th-century celebration with
musicians, hostesses and plenty of food and crafts,'' said Nancy
Carter, supervisor of the ferry house at the park.
   Melissa Opdyke, the municipal clerk in neighboring Washington
Township _ in Warren County, that is _ said the U.S. Postal Service
had solved the confusion.
   ``We're the only Washington Township with our own postal code,''
she said proudly. ``Bergen County's Washington Township is part of
Westwood, Morris County's is in Long Valley, Mercer's is in
Robbinsville, Gloucester's is in Turnersville and Burlington's is
in Egg Harbor.''
   That should clear up the problem, she said.

   Demonstrators demanding restoration of a
multiparty democracy clashed with police in at least five cities
Sunday, and three protesters and one policeman were killed,
witnesses and official reports said.
   More than 475 people were reported arrested and about 15 people
were injured on the first day of a mass campaign to demand an end
to the 29-year-old ban on political parties.
   In the capital, Katmandu, police used tear gas and clubs to
disperse thousands of chanting protesters, some of whom threw
stones and bricks at an official rally.
   State-run Radio Nepal reported from Hetauda, 72 miles south of
Katmandu, that one policeman died of head injuries and two other
policemen and at least half a dozen demonstrators were hurt in
scuffles.
   Two demonstrators were killed when police opened fire in
Bharatpur, 75 miles southeast of the capital, official sources said.
   Witnesses contacted from Katmandu said police also opened fire
in the midwestern city of Tansen, killing one demonstrator. They
said 30 demonstrators were arrested in Tansen and another 45 people
in nearby Pokhara.
   The demonstrators in Katmandu, mostly young people, unfurled
flags of the outlawed Nepali Congress Party and shouted ``We want
democracy!'' and ``Down with the panchayat system!'' _ set up in
1960 when King Birendra accused the government of misusing power
and banned all political parties.
   Police detained about 200 demonstrators in the city of 235,000.
Students said more than 200 of their colleagues at Tribhuvan
University were rounded up early Sunday to keep them from joining
the march. The students had tried to evade police by spending the
night in a nearby town.
   Activists hurled stones and bricks as a government-sponsored
procession of more than 80,000 people, led by Prime Minister Marich
Man Singh Shrestha, moved through the streets, chanting ``We love
our king and queen more than our lives'' and other slogans opposing
the protesters.
   State radio said seven people in the procession were hurt.
   The official march was to mark Nepal's 40th National Democracy
Day, the anniversary of the end of 104 years of rule by the
autocratic Rana family.
   In his message for the occasion, carried by official media, the
king said democracy demands respect for the majority's verdict. In
a national referendum in 1980, Nepal voted against restoring a
multiparty system.
   The number of anti-government demonstrators swelled from about
100 at the beginning to several thousand. About 200 riot police
stood guard.
   Joining the socialist-leaning Congress Party in the
demonstration was the United Left Front, an umbrella organization
of Communist Party factions. Front activists unfurled red flags
emblazoned with the hammer and sickle.
   ``I have never seen such flags in all my life,'' said fruit
vendor Asha Khadgi.
   The demonstrators marched about a half-mile down Katmandu's main
thoroughfare before police dispersed them with tear gas. Later,
they formed small groups that spread in different directions and
were charged by club-wielding riot police.
   The government accused the parties who led Sunday's action of
trying to impose their version of democracy on this Himilayan
nation, which they say already has a working democracy.
   After the 1980 referendum, Nepalese were given the right to
elect their representatives directly from their constituencies.
Now, 112 members are elected from 75 districts, and the remaining
28 are nominees of the king.
   Only an elected member is eligible to become prime minister.

   Movie director Spike Lee urged his alma mater to
ban fraternities as he accepted an achievement award from the
school, Morehouse College. He also said he was kicked off campus
while filming there in 1987.
   ``During this past semester, a young man ... died,'' Lee said,
referring to Joel Harris, an 18-year-old who officials said died of
a heart ailment after hazing from potential fraternity brothers.
   ``I think we should abolish fraternities from Morehouse's
campus.''
   Lee appeared at the Atlanta campus Saturday to be honored for
his achievements. He received a 1990 Bennie Award, handed out each
year as part of the all-male college's Founders Days celebrations.
   Lee also scolded Morehouse administrators, claiming they kicked
him off campus in 1987 while he was filming ``School Daze,'' which
portrayed a caste system based on skin color among blacks at a
mythical black college.
   ``After three weeks of shooting here, we were kicked off
campus,'' said Lee, a 1979 Morehouse graduate. ``We were told that
this whole color thing was irrelevant. Now in Atlanta there's a
court case where a light-skinned woman is suing a dark-skinned
woman.''
   Lee referred to Tracy Lynn Morrow, who sued her former employer,
the Internal Revenue Service, claiming her supervisor, a
dark-skinned black, fired her unfairly. The case is pending.
   ``The reason I made the film was to show the petty differences
that keep black people from being a unified people,'' said Lee, who
received a standing ovation. ``At no time did I think this film
would be a negative portrayal of blacks in higher education or
Morehouse as a whole.''
   Morehouse President Leroy Keith Jr. denied Lee's claims.
   ``I was not here at the time that happened. Morehouse has always
been proud of Spike Lee,'' Keith said. ``I think there was just a
disagreement over the process for approval for filming on campus.''
   Lee, 32, was nominated for an Academy Award last week for the
screenplay he wrote for his latest film, ``Do the Right Thing.''

   Actress Kathleen Turner bowed out of a weekend
matinee performance of ``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof'' here because of a
bout with laryngitis that had dragged on for two days.
   Turner missed the performance of the Tennessee Williams play on
Saturday at the Shubert Theater in Boston on the orders of her
doctor.
   The theater reported that officials expect Turner to be well
enough for the rest of her scheduled performances. The play, which
also stars Charles Durning, is slated to run here until Feb. 25,
before a Broadway opening.
   ``Her doctor would not allow her to perform for six hours in one
day,'' said usher Gene Marley III. ``I guess with her musky voice
and the length of the performance, it's taken a toll.''
   Turner is known for her film performances, including ``Body
Heat'' and ``Jewel of the Nile'' and the current ``War of the
Roses.''

   A promoter wants to bring the pop band New
Kids on the Block back to Memphis after two sellout concerts last
week matched an attendance record set by superstar Bruce
Springsteen.
   Bob Kelley, head of Mid-South Concerts, said the New Kids tied a
Mid-South Coliseum record, drawing 22,471 fans to two shows,
Wednesday and Thursday. Kelley said two Springsteen shows in 1984
drew that same number.
   Every seat in the coliseum was sold for the shows as fans bought
tickets for behind the stage.
   The New Kids won't be back in Memphis soon. Kelley says the
group is booked solid for months.
   Hits for the young group, known for a positive attitude and
anti-drug message, include ``This One's For the Childen'' and
``I'll Be Loving You Forever.''

   Grammy Award nominee Gordon Hartmann says
he got his start by sneaking into his grandmother's basement at age
4 to play with an old wooden accordian.
   At the time, he didn't want anyone to hear as he mimicked his
father and uncles, who played polka music in local bands.
   ``Of course, at that age, you don't realize that everyone
upstairs can hear you anyway,'' Hartmann said.
   Hartmann, 28, a Madison songwriter and bandleader, has

technology.
   Hartmann is a finalists for a Grammy Award in the polka music
category for his second album ``Polkaholic.'' The ceremonies are

   Leftist rebels attacked an
electric substation, knocking out power briefly and injuring a
guard, before they were repelled by army soldiers, the military
said Sunday.
   The skirmish Saturday night in the western part of the capital
did not result in long or widespread power outages, the military
statement said.
   No injuries to soldiers of the U.S.-supported government or to
rebels of that Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front were
reported.
   The last major rebel offensive occurred in November when more
than 1,000 people were killed in fighting in and around San
Salvador.
   In his Sunday homily, San Salvador's Roman Catholic archbishop,
Arturo Rivera Damas, said that government policies and rebel
attacks were causing great hardship to the nation's people.
   ``The pain has been immense,'' he said. ``The voice of our Lord
is resonating strongly on all horizons to say that violence brings
about more violence, that only love can build a new world.''

   Peggy Say paid tribute Sunday to PLO
Chairman Yasser Arafat for his efforts in trying to free the 18
Western hostages in Lebanon, including her brother, the
longest-held of the captives.
   In an hour-long meeting Saturday, the leader of the Palestine
Liberation Organization told Mrs. Say that he was doing his ``very
best'' to win the release of the hostages but did not go into
details.
   ``I was pleased to meet him after waiting such a long time to
come face to face with him,'' Mrs. Say told The Associated Press.
``I was encouraged that he said he would do his very best, which is
all I could ask of anybody.''
   Mrs. Say is the sister of Terry Anderson, the chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, kidnapped in Beirut on
March 16, 1985 and believed held by Shiite Moslem extremists with
close ties to Iran.
   ``I am sure (Arafat) will do whatever he can if he should find
himself in a position to do something,'' Mrs. Say said.
``Unfortunately, he has no direct influence on the kidnappers, but
he is a player in the Middle East and it's my job to approach
anyone who might help.''
   Mrs. Say is on a ``humanitarian pilgrimage'' to gather
international support for the release of Anderson and the other
hostages. Thus far, she has met U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar, Pope John Paul II and leading officials of the European
Parliament in Strasbourg, France.
   Mrs. Say is accompanied on her tour by Don Mell, the AP
photographer who was with Anderson when he was abducted, and Larry
Heinzerling, a deputy director of the AP which supports Mrs. Say's
efforts financially and logistically in pressing its own efforts to
win Anderson's release.
   A group calling itself Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, is
believed to be holding Anderson and Terry Waite, special envoy of
Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, who disappeared Jan. 20,
1987 while trying to negotiate the release of the hostages.
   Arafat received Mrs. Say during a luncheon with a group of
friends and supporters in his luxurious, well-guarded mansion
overlooking the Mediterranean in suburban Gammarth.
   The Palestinian leader invited Mrs. Say to sit next to him at
the long table and showed her the Arab fashion of eating roast lamb
with his fingers.
   ``I liked him personally,'' Mrs. Say declared. ``He was very
charming and sympathetic, particularly in listening to my problems,
which may seem small when compared with the many problems he must
have to contend with himself.''
   Mrs. Say leaves Monday for Paris, where she will meet UNESCO
Director General Federico Mayor, later heading to Damascus for a
meeting with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Al-Sharaa and then
Canterbury, England to meet Runcie.
   ``What is discouraging is that I've been making this trek for
five years now,'' Mrs. Say said, ``and I never met anyone who said
he could solve it. It is always a complicated circuit through a
series of other people.''
   Arafat told her the man with the greatest possible influence
would be President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran, but that his room
for maneuvering is limited by hard-liners in his government.
   Mrs. Say said she still hoped to get permission to visit Iran,
although her many visa applications have gone unanswered.
   In all, eight Americans, four Britons, two West Germans, two
Swiss, an Italian and an Irishman are believed held captive.

   Moments after the curtain fell on his
performance in a Verdi opera at the Kennedy Center, Soviet tenor
Vladimir Popov played the leading role in an emotional backstage
drama when he received his U.S. citizenship papers from Supreme
Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
   ``This is the greatest day in my life,'' declared Popov, who
fell to his knees, crossed himself and grinned broadly. ``I'm a
little bit nervous.''
   Popov, 42, the son of a retired Soviet army general, defected in
1982 in Milan, Italy, while on leave from the Bolshoi Opera to
study Italian repertoire at La Scala. He sought asylum at the U.S.
consulate in Milan wearing only a T-shirt and a pair of jeans.
   On Saturday night, Popov sang with prima donna Aprile Millo in
the Washington Opera's first production of the Giuseppe Verdi
spectacular, ``Aida,'' before a sold-out audience in the Kennedy
Center Opera House.
   After taking his bows at the footlights, Popov joined his
American-born wife, Lucy, backstage for a joyful celebration with a
small circle of friends and well-wishers.
   Still wearing the heavy makeup and glittering robes of the
opera's Egyptian war hero, Radames, the stocky tenor was greeted by
a black-robed Scalia, the son of a Sicilian immigrant and a
self-confessed opera lover.
   ``I am delighted to welcome you to the land of the free and the
home of the brave,'' said Scalia, who gave the singer his
citizenship papers encased in a red-framed album with ``Vladimir
Popov'' printed in gold letters on the black leather cover.
   ``The reason you gave for coming to America was that you wanted
a choice,'' said Scalia, ``the choice to be the person you want to
be and to perfect all your abilities.''
   Popov beamed, sighed and responded to the applause in Russian
style by applauding back. Later, at a black-tie cast party, Popov
wore an American flag pin on his tuxedo lapel as Washington Opera
general director Martin Feinstein hailed ``our newest American
citizen and a wonderful human being.''
   Popov interrupted rehearsals for ``Aida'' on Friday to fly to
snowbound New Hampshire to take his oath as a naturalized citizen
from a federal judge in Concord. After reciting the Pledge of
Allegiance, Popov turned to his wife and said: ``Now I've got my
second voice. I can vote now.''
   Mrs. Popov, the daughter of Ukrainian immigrants, said her
husband plans to cast his first vote on March 13 in municipal
elections in their hometown of Wentworth, N.H. Her brother, Vitaly,
is a candidate for selectman on the local town council.
   In an interview earlier in the week, Popov said he defected
because of the suffocating bureaucracy and limited repertoire of
the Bolshoi Opera, where talented young singers were suppressed in
favor of a ``clique'' of aging stars chosen by seniority.
   ``My progress was so slow,'' he said in halting English. ``I
sing a little bit here and a little bit there, but they always say
`this is not your time' or `no, you only learn one opera in two
years.'''
   ``It was a matter of having choices,'' he says. ``In the Soviet
Union you have no choices. You are told what to sing, when and
where to sing it. Here we have choices. That's really the number
one reason.''
   His life has changed quickly since he defected in Milan on April
29, 1982 _ his 35th birthday. He arrived in New York two days
later. He soon met Lucy, his volunteer interpreter, and married her
a few months later. He auditioned for the Washington Opera on their
honeymoon, and made his debut with the Metropolitan Opera in New
York in 1984.
   This year, Popov has been signed to sing in 30 operas, concerts
and recitals across the country and abroad, including La Scala this
summer, the opening of the Vienna State Opera's 1990-91 season next
fall and a return engagement at the Met next winter.
   When he's not touring, Popov enjoys cross-country skiing and
boating on his 32-acre farm in the New Hampshire mountains, or
sipping a beer while watching Charles Bronson and Arnold
Schwarzenegger action videos at home. ``He's a couch potato,'' his
wife says.
   Popov said he was cursed as a traitor by Communist Party bosses,
and his defection was bitterly opposed by his military father.
   ``For the first year or more, I had bad dreams every night that
they would come and take me away,'' Popov said.
   But he says he's never had any regrets. ``Right now I have a
different life,'' he says, laughing. ``What could I do in Russia
now? Drink vodka maybe.''

<BYLINE>Prosecutors Prepare to Fill In Final Pieces of Exxon Valdez Puzzle.

<TEXT>
   After two weeks of testimony,
prosecutors plan to wind up the case against Joseph Hazelwood by
offering a few more pieces of the Exxon Valdez puzzle and some
expert witnesses to put it all together.
   Navigation experts are expected to testify as well as those who
have studied the effects of alcohol over long periods.
   Coast Guardsmen who went aboard the crippled vessel in the hours
after it hit a jagged reef are likely to provide accounts of the
final hours in Hazelwood's ordeal at sea.
   The 987-foot tanker he commanded, one of the newest and most
advanced in Exxon's fleet of oil cargo carriers, grounded on Bligh
Reef in the early morning hours of March 24. The holes gashed in
its giant tanks caused the nation's worst oil spill, a gusher of
10.92 million gallons of oil spurting into the crystal waters of
Prince William Sound.
   Countless birds, fish and wildlife perished and hundreds of
miles of rocky shore was blackened.
   Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y., is charged with felony
criminal mischief and three misdemeanors _ reckless endangerment,
negligent discharge of oil and operating a vessel while
intoxicated. If convicted he could face a maximum of 7\ years in
prison and $61,000 in fines.
   At his trial, a procession of 23 prosecution witnesses have
given accounts of the disaster and its possible causes. Testimony
has focused on Hazelwood's alleged intoxication and his behavior as
commander of the ship.
   Key points of inquiry have been:
   _ Was Hazelwood drunk? Crew members say he neither slurred nor
staggered and was cool and calm in the wake of the accident. But
blood and urine tests taken nearly 10 hours after the accident
showed alcohol in his system, and he was seen drinking in a Valdez
bar earlier in the day.
   _ Did Hazelwood act recklessly when he left the bridge of his
ship in the hands of the third mate and a helmsman during a tricky
maneuver past ice? Witnesses say Hazelwood knew the helmsman needed
close supervision, even when doing simple tasks. The veteran third
mate, Gregory Cousins, said he agreed to take charge of the ship
while Hazelwood went below for a few minutes.
   _ Was Hazelwood trying to steer his ship off the reef after the
accident? Witnesses have said that backing the tanker off the reef
might have caused it to capsize, adding loss of life to the
tragedy. But Hazelwood's lawyers say he never reversed gears and
ultimately stabilized the ship on the reef. In a tape played for
jurors, the skipper tells the Coast Guard: ``We are working our way
off the reef.''
   _ Did Hazelwood endanger the crew by not sounding a general
alarm or abandoning ship after the grounding? The prosecution says
he should have awakened everyone and possibly gotten them into
lifboats. The chief mate testified that Hazelwood acted prudently
and would have taken greater risks putting people into the choppy
waters of Prince William Sound in the middle of the night.
   Experts in maritime affairs may give their opinions of
Hazelwood's decisions. And specialists in the study of alcoholism
will give opinions on whether he was intoxicated.
   The range of experts who may testify was indicated Friday when
Assistant District Attorney Brent Cole disclosed he had discovered
some new witnesses he wanted to call. The defense protested it was
too late to come up with new experts and the judge said he might
not grant permission for their appearance but took the matter under
consideration.
   The experts are said to be able to determine from tape-recorded
voices whether a person is drunk. They would be asked to analyze
the tapes played for jurors of Hazelwood's conversations with Coast
Guard monitors moments after his ship ran onto the reef.
   The skipper spoke slowly and in a deep, gravelly voice as he
announced the disaster, saying, ``We've fetched up hard aground ...
evidently leaking some oil. We're going to be here for a while.''
   Was that his normal voice? Crew members said that was how he
spoke all the time and certainly how he sounded earlier in the day.
Prosecutors are trying to prove that he sounded intoxicated.
   The trial was in recess for the Presidents Day holiday and was
to resume Tuesday.

   The faithful and the curious came out to
watch a 69-year-old musher cross the finish line of the 540-mile
Race to the Sky, a sled dog run that had beaten him on four
previous tries.
   David Armstrong was the last of the finishers Saturday, but he
finished. Seven others of the 15 starters already had dropped out.
   ``I do it because I still can,'' Armstrong said in Lincoln, the
last checkpoint before the finish line and, until Saturday, the
farthest he had gone in the race. ``And as long as I can, I guess I
will.''
   Led by 10 sled dogs and cheered on by scores of supporters,
Armstrong, of Helena, crossed the finish line to officially place
eighth. Alaskan Dean Osmar shattered the course record Thursday,
winning in 120 hours 9 minutes.
   Armstrong, who began racing sled dogs in New Hampshire in 1937
and helped establish long-distance racing in Montana, was
officially clocked at 164 hours and 39 minutes to conclude the race
at Dog Creek, near the Continential Divide west of Helena.
   The 5th annual race began south of Helena a week before,
retracing most of the same ground.
   While Saturday's final chapter took place in Dog Creek, the
story began to unfold 89 miles away in Lincoln where Armstrong
realized he was going to be able to finish his first 500-mile dog
race.
   ``It's become more of an emotional thing,'' Armstrong said.
``The feeling is totally different. I guess it's because we've
never finished before.
   ``It's a little bit of stubbornness in me. But overall, I'd say
it's a culmination of five tries.
   ``I guess I was optimistic about finally making it,'' he said.
``It means a lot. I have three dogs that have raced with me all
five years. It's just a team effort.''

   A party to celebrate the incorporation
of this suburb between Seattle and Tacoma will be held outside the
municipal boundaries, embarassed organizers have learned.
   Only after scheduling arranging the bash at the Sportsworld
bowling alley complex did planners learn that it was not within the
municipality approved by voters a year ago, said organizer Mary
Ehlis.
   ``We thought it was in the city because the border is right
there,'' she said. ``Then I got one of the new maps that came out,
and I went, `Ohhhhh ...' I couldn't believe it. It's just a
fraction out, but it is out.''
   The Feb. 28 party is the main celebration on the first day of
cityhood for Federal Way, population about 58,000.
   Other events include noting the delivery of the city's first
baby at St. Francis Community Hospital, unveiling the first City

<HEAD>Despite Weak Power Base, Kaifu Leads Party to Majority</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Japan-Election, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu is youthful, eloquent
and witty. Although untainted by recent political scandals, he has
little power base of his own in the governing Liberal Democratic
Party.
   In short, he is everything that party power brokers were looking
for last August after the Liberal Democrats lost their majority in
Parliament's upper house and scandals forced two prime ministers
from office.
   Kaifu, who reportedly owns thousands of polka-dot neckties, is a
member of the smallest faction in the governing party. His
elevation to prime minister last year at age 58 fulfilled a
prophecy he made 29 years earlier, at the age of 29. Not
surprisingly, he regards 29 as his lucky number.
   Other political seers, however, forecast a short stay for the
confident politician from Aichi prefecture in central Japan, about
170 miles west of Tokyo.
   The opposition quickly branded him a puppet of former Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita, who was forced to resign last year after
charges he had received more than $1 million in donations and loans
from the Recruit Co., the company at the center of a massive
scandal that plagued Japanese politics for much of the past year.
   Political analysts predicted Kaifu would remain in power just
long enough for the Liberal Democrats to regroup and cleanse their
scandal-tainted image.
   That fate may still await him. Powerful men like former Foreign
Minister Shintaro Abe, who was re-elected Sunday despite ties to
the Recruit scandal, reportedly aspire to replace him.
   While Kaifu was in Eastern Europe in January, Abe overshadowed
him by leading a delegation to the Soviet Union to meet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev. And Kaifu reportedly has been excluded from
recent key party decisions, including the timing of Sunday's
election.
   But while Kaifu has not pursued an independent line or made much
concrete progress in promised party reforms, he has proven a
credible and attractive leader to the public.
   Kaifu, a former education minister, was first elected to
Parliament at the age of 29, when he was sent to the House of
Representatives by the third district of Aichi prefecture.
   He became a protege of the late Prime Minister Takeo Miki, a
reformer who led the party out of a Lockheed payoff scandal in the
mid-1970s. Miki's faction evolved into the present Komoto faction,
to which Kaifu belongs.
   A graduate of Waseda University, the alma mater of many Liberal
Democratic politicians, Kaifu was a member of the debate club.
   Kaifu has two children, and until he became prime minister
regularly jogged in the morning with his wife.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In her three years as chairwoman of the Japan
Socialist Party, Takako Doi has shaken up the staid world of
Japanese politics and along the way become a widely admired figure.
   Ms. Doi, a 61-year-old former law professor, brought her party
into serious contention for power last summer when she led an
election campaign that stripped the long-ruling Liberal Democrats
of their majority in the upper house of Parliament and boosted the
Socialists' standing.
   Her exhortative stumping style, so out of keeping with the meek
image commonly projected by most Japanese women, galvanized female
voters.
   Along with other disgruntled members of the electorate, it was
female voters who ushered a record 17 women _ 10 of them Socialists
_ into the 252-seat upper house. Japanese media dubbed the
phenomenon ``Madonna power.''
   Again in Sunday's lower house election, the Socialists gained
strength at the expense of other parties, chipping away at the
Liberal Democrats' single-party domination of Japanese politics.
   ``This election shows that Japan's political party system has
matured some,'' said Takehiko Kamo, professor of political science
at Tokyo University. ``Under Ms. Doi's leadership, the Socialists
are becoming more mature.''
   Ms. Doi was born Nov. 30, 1928, in Japan's major port city of
Kobe, 270 miles west of Tokyo.
   The daughter of a physician, she was educated at a Kobe girls'
school and later in Kyoto, the ancient capital of Japan. There, in
1949, she entered Doshisha University's law department.
   She attracted notice as a ferocious cheerleader for the rugby
squad and as an actress in a college Shakespeare production.
   After graduating in 1951, she was made a research fellow at
Doshisha, and later a law professor. She remained unmarried.
   A specialist in Japan's constitution, she became involved in
politics in the 1960s, and in 1969 was elected to the House of
Representatives from the 2nd District of Hyogo prefecture, near
Kobe.
   She became party vice chairwoman in 1983, and its leader on
Sept. 8, 1986, the first woman to head a major political party in
modern Japan.
   An entry in ``Who's Who in Japan'' lists piano and music
appreciation as her hobbies, but the popular press says pachinko, a
Japanese pinball game, rates higher with her.

   Improving energy efficiency using today's
technology can solve the global warming problem at a profit of a
trillion dollars a year, a study says.
   A push for energy efficiency would reduce the use of coal and
other fossil fuels that is raising carbon dioxide levels in the
atmosphere, said the study's author, Amory Lovins of the Rocky
Mountain Institute in Snowmass, Colo.
   ``Why fiddle while coal burns? We ought to get on with it,''
Lovins said Sunday at the annual meeting of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science. The trillion dollars
that could be saved each year is equal to the global military
budget, Lovins said.
   Saving energy is far more profitable than building new power
plants, he said. Indeed, energy efficiency is so profitable that it
ought to be encouraged even if there were no threat of global
warming from the increased atmospheric carbon dioxide, he said.
   ``It doesn't matter how the scientific evidence is shaking out
(on the severity of global warming), because we ought to do the
same thing anyway,'' Lovins said.
   Lovins is an economist and consultant who has been arguing since
the mid-1970s for greater energy efficiency.
   He has been criticized by the utility industry and others who
say that energy efficiency of the degree that he is calling for
cannot be practically achieved.
   Lovins has worked hard to support the argument that very large
improvements in energy efficiency can be made using current
technology.
   He cited a study last year by the Swedish State Power Board
which found that over the next 20 years Sweden could expand its
economy by 50 percent, reduce carbon dioxide output by one-third
and lower utility bills _ all through the use of increased energy
efficiency.
   That includes the voter-mandated elimination by 2010 of nuclear
power, which currently supplies half of Sweden's electricity.
   In the United States, Lovins has calculated that one-fourth of
U.S. electricity output could be saved with more efficient
lighting, one-fourth with efficient motors, and one-fourth in
appliances and other equipment.
   One problem is that there is no agency to review and redesign a
manufacturer's use of motors, for example. The technology exists,
but the infrastructure to make it available doesn't, Lovins said.
   Furthermore, utility planners, policy-makers and politicians are
not aware of the potential for savings, he said.
   Lovins and his colleagues have done a study to show the promise
of savings using currently available energy-saving technology.
   They found that a world of 8 billion people with an economy five
times the size of the current one could be supported with only
one-third of the energy used today.
   ``Energy policy built on efficiency would enable the earth to
support a prosperous civilization that was not plagued by acid
rain, global warming, urban smog, nuclear proliferation and
deforestation,'' the study concluded.
   Among the schemes Lovins has devised are programs in which fees
and rebates are used to promote efficiency.
   For example, fees for hooking up new buildings to utility lines
could be raised for buildings that use energy inefficiently, and
rebates could be given to energy-efficient buildings.
   The same kind of sliding scale could be used for cars, with fees
charged for gas-guzzlers and rebates offered for energy-efficient
vehicles.

<TEXT>
   The Red Cross evacuated 500 commandos of
renegade Gen. Michel Aoun's army from a helicopter base Sunday
after it fell to the rival Lebanese Forces militia.
   The evacuation was possible after Aoun and rival Christian
warlord Samir Geagea called a cease-fire Saturday night to halt
their murderous struggle for control of Lebanon's Christian enclave.
   Police said 30 combatants were killed and 42 wounded in the
fighting that preceded the fall of the Adma helicopter base to
Geagea's Lebanese Forces militia. The base was Aoun's only major
foothold in Kesrouan province, a Geagea stronghold.
   With Adma's fall, Geagea now controls nearly two-thirds of the
Christian enclave, plus all its ports.
   Aoun has no harbor equipped to receive ships and is expected to
demand the withdrawal of the Lebanese Forces from Beirut's port as
a condition for a durable peace.
   ``Otherwise, the cease-fire will be short,'' said a police
spokesman.
   Aoun's command reported the deaths of 10 soldiers in combat
during the past two days.
   That raised the overall toll to 660 killed and 1,872 wounded in
18 days of fighting between Aoun's 19,000 troops and Geagea's
6,000-strong militia, which has 30,000 reservists.
   More than 100,000 residents, one-tenth of the enclave's
population, fled to Syrian-policed Moslem zones, and material
losses were estimated at $750 million.
   It was the worst confrontation between Christians since
Lebanon's civil war between Christians and Moslems broke out in
1975.
   Shells tore through schools and churches and apartments
collapsed on their residents. Hospitals were packed with
casualties. Thousands of cars and hundreds of shops were gutted.
   Power plants and water pumping plants came to a standstill on
the first day of the fighting, leaving the Lebanese capital and its
environs without electricity and running water for nearly three
weeks.
   Police reported only scattered gunfire Sunday. The truce was the
12th called since the clashes erupted Jan. 30.
   ``It looks like this one might hold,'' said the police
spokesman, who cannot be named under standing rules. ``Both sides
have pledged strict adherence and the evacuation of the Adma base
is an encouraging start.''
   Aoun conceded Adma's loss. In an interview broadcast by his
Radio Lebanon station, he said the negotiated evacuation of the
garrison was an ``indicator pointing to a possible political
settlement, but not part of a settlement.''
   An estimated 1,500 Lebanese Forces militiamen with 20 T-54 tanks
and 40 armored personnel carriers closed in on the hilltop base
from three directions Saturday.
   After 12 hours of fighting, Aoun agreed to a cease-fire on
condition of a ``dignified evacuation of his 500 commandos with all
their weapons,'' said the police spokesman.
   They rolled out from Adma in four U.S.-built M-48 tanks, 25
armored personnel carriers and 12 Red Cross buses starting at
midnight Saturday, leaving behind 12 helicopter gunships.
   Lebanese Forces militiamen then moved in to take over the base.
   The convoy of Aoun's commandos climbed through the Kesrouan
highway to a mountain ridge and crossed into the Aoun-held Metn
province early Sunday, the spokesman reported.
   ``The operation was completed without a hitch,'' said Shaker Abu
Suleiman, a member of a three-man mediation committee representing
Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir, spiritual head of the dominant Maronite
Catholic community. ``A massacre in Adma has been averted.''
   Geagea attacked Adma after Aoun's forces defeated the Lebanese
Forces in their main stronghold of east Beirut, Ein Rummaneh.
   That left Geagea and his fighters trapped in the city's
Ashrafiyeh residential district and the neighboring Karantina
quarter with their backs to the sea.
   ``Aoun's army can move in against them any time, but it will be
another horrendous massacre. Geagea is bent on a scorched-earth
resistance, and his fighters have mined all approaches to the two
districts,'' the police spokesman said.

<HEAD>Bennett: Some Type of `Death Penalty' for Bankers Who Launder Drug
Money</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drug policy director William Bennett said
Sunday he would support ``something analogous'' to the death
penalty for high-level bankers who launder drug money.
   Bennett has said he supports the death penalty for convicted
drug kingpins and, in an appearance on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press''
program, he said bankers who knowingly handle drug cash should be
treated similarly.
   ``If we're talking about capital punishment for people who are
high-level drug dealers, we ought to be talking about something
analogous for the high-level banker who trades in drug cash,'' he
said.
   President Bush's proposed drug control strategy calls for
expanding the circumstances under which convicted drug kingpins
could face the death penalty.
   Bennett's comment came during questioning about a case in which
the Luxembourg-based Bank of Credit and Commerce International
pleaded guilty in January to cocaine-related money-laundering
charges and agreed to forfeit $14 million and to help prosecutors
who say the case has ties to deposed Panamanian leader, Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
   Bennett indicated he was concerned that the sentence was light
and said he raised that concern with Bush ``and he agreed.''
   But asked whether he was troubled that the bank was still in
business, he said, ``Not until the story's over. I want to see
where the investigation comes out.''
   He said the case is part of an ongoing investigation and that he
and other officials will continue to monitor it.
   Bennett also said he hopes for greater military cooperation
between the United States and South America's cocaine-producing
countries to stop the flow of illegal drugs.
   ``Will there be cooperation between Colombia and the United
States, other countries and the United States involving military
cooperation?'' he said. ``I think there will be.''
   He added: ``I would not be surprised if in the future we have
discussions with President Barco (of Colombia) and other presidents
about the ways in which U.S. military intelligence ... can be
useful to them. ...
   ``They asked for our help last year, and if they ask for our
help again, we'll be interested in providing it,'' he said.
   The United States has been providing aid to Colombia, Peru and
Bolivia to help those countries cut off drug production and stop
trafficking to the United States.
   Bush, at the drug summit in Cartagena, Colombia, last week
signed a communique with Barco and the presidents of Peru and
Bolivia that rules out the use of U.S. military forces in those
countries but encourages cooperation and intelligence-sharing.
   The United States also agreed to provide increased equipment and
training to the law enforcement agencies and armed forces of the
other countries.

<HEAD>One Prisoner Killed, Another Hurt in Helicopter Escape Attempt</HEAD>

   One convict was killed and another seriously
injured in an escape attempt Sunday when a rope that was lowered
into their prison yard by a helicopter broke, the government said.
   The rope got tangled in cables that had been laid above the
prison yard to prevent such escapes, officials at the Justice
Ministry said.
   The prisoners' three accomplices in the helicopter escaped,
according to the ministry officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Emile Dieudonne, 38, died after falling 25 feet to the exercise
yard at the Fresnes prison in suburban Paris. Fernando Alonso de
Celada of Argentina, also 38, suffered multiple fractures but his
life was not in danger, officials said.
   It was not clear whether the two men collaborated in the escape
attempt.
   An inidentified man later telephoned the French news agency
Agence France-Presse and said he had participated in the attempt.
   He said it had been organized for Dieudonne alone. AFP said
Alonso de Celada grabbed onto Dieudonne's legs as the helicopter
started to rise and that Dieudonne tried to kick the other prisoner
away before the rope snapped.
   Authorities said three unidentified men rented the Alouette III
helicopter from an agency in nearby Issy-Les-Moulineaux and pulled
guns on the pilot after they were airborne. The pilot was ordered
to head for the Fresnes prison and to hover above the prison yard,
where about 20 inmates were exercising.
   A steel-centered, nylon, mountain-climbing rope was lowered
through the grill of cables above the prison yard.
   Dieudonne and Alonso de Celada grabbed the rope and the
helicopter started to fly away. But the rope apparently caught on
the grillwork and snapped, officials said.
   The armed trio then ordered the pilot to land at an empty sports
stadium, where they drove off in a car and remained at large Sunday
night.
   Dieudonne, a convicted robber, began serving a 12-year sentence
in 1984. Alonso de Celada is serving a life term for two murders
and 20 assaults.

<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For a guy holding a low-ranking state
office, Texas Agriculture Commissioner Jim Hightower enjoys a high
profile.
   Democrats put him on their national convention podium. President
Bush's son endorsed one of his Republican rivals. GOP lawmakers
tried to abolish his job. The Texas Farm Bureau tried and failed to
get Texas Rangers pitcher Nolan Ryan to run as a Republican against
him, then sponsored six farmers to challenge him in the Democratic
primary March 13.
   He's even been blamed for the coming invasion of killer bees.
   Through it all, Hightower has kept his trademark sense of humor.
   ``There's an old East Texas saying that a lie is halfway around
the world before the truth can get its boots on. We're getting our
boots on early because they're going to be telling a lot of lies,''
he said.
   After reports of an apparently bogus news release being
circulated that blamed Hightower for failing to stop killer bees
moving north from Central America, he quipped, ``I'm going to have
to start wearing pest strip on my lapel as I go around, just to get
through this election.''
   Other criticism has been more serious.
   Republicans and conservative Democrats have accused the
self-proclaimed populist of using the agriculture job to promote
his own political future rather than the work of Texas farmers and
ranchers.
   The Dallas Morning News said last week that $6,600 in
contributions were made to Hightower's campaign by seed and grain
dealers after they were visited by an agriculture department
employee who was accompanied by a consultant soliciting for the
campaign.
   Hightower denies knowing about the solicitations.
   Adopting the nickname ``Whole Hog,'' Hightower was elected in
1982. He quickly became a Democratic spokesman against President
Reagan's farm policies with such lines as, ``Reagan's idea of a
good farm program is `Hee Haw.'''
   He was one of the few white politicians to back Jesse Jackson's
1988 presidential bid and talked of challenging Republican U.S.
Sen. Phil Gramm this year.
   Instead, he opted to seek a third four-year term, saying he
wants to keep pushing innovative economic development efforts that
include alternative crops and direct marketing.
   His department has encouraged farmers to plant everything from
Christmas trees to wine grapes. It started a ``Taste of Texas''
national promotion to help small producers sell everything from
smoked sausage to hot sauce. It helped Panhandle grain farmers
start a flour mill.
   ``It's a philosophy of economic development at the grass-roots
level,'' he said. ``We've been able to turn loose the enterprise
of, really, thousands of Texas producers in a way that demonstrates
that this new agricultural model actually works.''
   But he made enemies, too.
   When the U.S. Department of Agriculture balked over European
demands for beef free of artificial growth hormones, Hightower
moved to establish a state program to certify such meat. That
brought cries from the White House and the Texas Farm Bureau, which
charged that he was giving credibility to what they consider false
fears about hormones and making traditional ranchers look bad.
   Hightower's aggressive stance on pesticide regulation won praise
from farm workers. It also brought efforts to turn his elected job
into an appointive one. Conservative legislators lost that battle,
but they did create a new pesticide regulation board on which
Hightower is but one member of nine.
   Looking for a big name to go against Hightower, Republicans
urged former Dallas Cowboys running back Walt Garrison to run. The
Farm Bureau sought Ryan. Neither took up the challenge.
   When Republican state Rep. Rick Perry entered the race,
Hightower replied, ``I thought they were talking about Gaylord
Perry,'' the retired pitcher.
   Other Republican hopefuls are Gene Duke, a cotton seed
businessman, and consultant Richard McIver.
   All six Democratic primary challengers are farmers or ranchers
who paid their $3,000 filing fees with contributions from the Farm
Bureau's political arm. They are Neal Burnett, Dan Pustejovsky, Dan
Krenek, John Earl Smith, Paul McDaniel and Clyde Chandler.
   ``The incumbent commissioner has no practical farming or
ranching experience,'' said Farm Bureau official Vernie Glasson.
``As we see it today, it is an anybody but the incumbent campaign.''
   ``Antelope meat and Christmas trees (are) well and good,'' said
Chandler. ``But while you spend all your money, time and energy on
these small, insignificant amount of crops, the mainstream
agriculture is suffering.''
   ``Texas farmers and ranchers deserve to have one of their own as
agriculture commissioner,'' said Perry, a former Democrat who
expects to raise $2 million to $3 million for the race.
   ``Hightower spent an inordinate amount of time in 1987 and 1988
outside Texas, campaigning for Jesse Jackson and Mike Dukakis and
preparing to run himself against Sen. Phil Gramm. Those were not
the activities Texans had in mind for their agriculture
commissioner,'' Perry said.
   Hightower says the race is a referendum on the department's
future.
   ``We've carved out a pretty clear identity, I think, in the
public mind,'' he said. ``Basically all I've heard from the folks
who are running against me is that I'm a friend of Jane Fonda.''

   Fresh from playing polo in Florida, Prince
Charles is flying into town this week to indulge in his other
favorite sport _ architect-bashing _ and American architects are
falling over themselves for the chance to be abused.
   Disappointed fans are still fighting over nonexistent tickets to
Thursday night's black-tie gala of the American Institute of
Architects, where the 41-year-old heir to the British throne and
outspoken critic of contemporary architecture will be the main
attraction.
   ``We've been sold out for a month,'' institute Vice President
Gregg Ward said, adding that there was a lengthy waiting list.
``People have been calling my boss, the British Embassy, the White
House, even Buckingham Palace trying to get in.''
   Among AIA's membership ``Certainly the interest has been
extraordinary since we announced that Prince Charles was coming,''
Ward said.
   When callers are told that all 1,200 seats for the $250-a-plate
dinner at the National Building Museum had been snapped up, he
said, ``some have expressed disappointment, some have been on the
verge of tears, some have been in a rage.''
   The future British king was expected to pay President Bush a
courtesy call at the White House before the dinner. They last met
during Charles' low-key visit to Washington one year ago, when he
had afternoon tea with Vice President Dan Quayle and dinner with
Bush at Camp David, Md.
   Before his dinner audience of leading U.S. architects, members
of Congress, Supreme Court justices, diplomats and Hollywood
celebrities Thursday night, Charles will have a new opportunity to
express his disdain for modern architecture.
   In the past, he has stirred controversy by saying London's
skyline has suffered more damage from architects, city planners and
developers than from German bombers in World War II. He says some
of the city's new buildings remind him of word processors and
nuclear power stations.
   In ``A Vision of Britain,'' an award-winning book he published
last year, Charles said some modern architects have created
``Frankenstein monsters, devoid of character, alien and largely
unloved except by the professors who have been concocting these
horrors in their laboratories.''
   During the AIA's five-day ``Accent on Architecture'' conference
this week, leading U.S. architects will debate Charles' call for
building designs that respect the surrounding landscape and are
scaled to human proportions and needs.
   Bush plans to present the AIA's Gold Medal _ its highest honor _
to Fayetteville, Ark., architect Fay Jones, a former pupil of Frank
Lloyd Wright, at a White House ceremony Thursday. Jones will be a
guest of honor at the dinner where Charles will speak.
   Charles also will preside at the ceremonial opening of an AIA
exhibit of 120 original drawings, models, paintings, manuscripts
and artifacts from Sir Christopher Wren's design and construction
of St. Paul's Cathedral in London.
   Charles and his wife, Diana, who is not accompanying him on his
current tour, were married in St. Paul's in 1981.
   The prince's busy schedule also included an embassy reception
for the alumni association of Marshall Scholars, a British
government program under which 30 exceptional American students are
selected annually to spend two or three years at British
universities.
   Charles' itinerary included his arrival in Vero Beach, Fla.,
Friday to play in two charity polo matches over four days. He was
traveling to Washington via Charleston, S.C., where he will attend
an international business conference sponsored by his ``Business in
the Community'' program, which seeks to enlist corporations in the
revitalization of local communities.

<HEAD>Sharon Resigns, Says He Will Challenge Shamir</HEAD>

   Ariel Sharon, leader of the far-right wing of
the Likud bloc, resigned from the Cabinet Sunday and said he would
campaign to topple Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and replace the
government peace plan with his own.
   Sharon said he decided to resign because he felt the
government's plan made too many concessions to the Arabs and could
lead to war.
   ``The plan by itself is a mistake. It will not bring us peace,
but will lead to more tension and more bloodshed and maybe even to
a war which all of us would like to prevent,'' Sharon said.
   The 62-year-old conservative, who as defense minister
masterminded Israel's 1982 Lebanon invasion, is Shamir's chief
rival in the right-wing Likud bloc.
   He has repeatedly argued that Shamir's plan, which calls for
Palestinian elections and negotiations on a limited autonomy in the
occupied lands, could bring the PLO into the peace process. He
fears it could lead to Israel's relinquishing the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, captured during the 1967 Middle East war.
   Sharon, the trade minister, first announced his resignation at a
tumultuous Likud meeting last week. He made it official at the
weekly Cabinet session Sunday. By law, the resignation is effective
after 48 hours.
   Sharon still retains his key post of chairing Likud's ruling
Central Committee. He said he plans to take his campaign to the
people to win support.
   Asked if he would challenge Shamir's leadership of the Likud,
Sharon said: ``The answer is yes.''
   Likud shares power with the center-left Labor Party, which
favors compromise and giving up some land for peace.
   In 1984, Sharon challenged Shamir for the leadership of Likud
following the resignation of Menachem Begin. He told reporters he
then received 42 percent of the vote. Polls taken before last
week's Likud meeting showed Shamir ahead by 63 percent to 78
percent.
   Speaking to reporters in his Jerusalem office after resigning,
Sharon said he would fight to replace Shamir's plan, which was
ratified by the Cabinet last May, with one of his own.
   He said his plan would involve opening the border with Jordan
and creating housing projects for Palestinian refugees in the
occupied territories to reduce tensions.
   The former general also said that the Arab uprising in the
territories, now in its 27th month, would have to be crushed before
peace talks can begin.
   In the latest fatality of the uprising, a 17-year old
Palestinian girl was fatally wounded Sunday during a stone-throwing
clash with soldiers and Israeli settlers in the West Bank city of
Nablus, Arab reporters said.
   The army confirmed the death of the girl, Sawsan Shahshir, and
said it was investigating.
   Sharon, a famous army commander still respected by many
Israelis, has served in Israeli governments since 1977.
   As agriculture minister, Sharon led a controversial campaign to
build Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza. The settlements
are often cited by the United States as an obstacle to peace.
   In 1981, Sharon was appointed defense minister and directed the
1982 Lebanon invasion that led to an unpopular three-year
occupation.
   He was forced to resign as defense minister in 1983 when an
Israeli inquiry found him indirectly responsible for the massacre
of hundreds of Palestinians by Israel's Lebanese militia allies in
Beirut's refugee camps.
   But he stayed in the Cabinet as a minister without portfolio and
has served as trade minister and a member of the decision-making
Inner Cabinet since 1984.
   Also Sunday, Israeli troops shot and wounded 10 Palestinians in
a stone-throwing clash in the Gaza Strip town of Rafah, Arab
reports said.
   The bodies of two Palestinian men were found near Nablus, but
the motives behind their murders could not be immediately
determined.
   During the uprising, Palestinians have killed at least 186
fellow Arabs on suspicion of assisting Israeli authorities. At
least 657 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops or
civilians, and 43 Israelis have been killed.

   After Willie Horton attacked a white couple while
on furlough from a state prison, George Bush's campaign aides used
his image as a potent political weapon.
   When Charles Stuart plotted the killing of his wife, as police
have come to believe, he thought he could convince an entire city
that a black man had committed the crime. And he nearly succeeded
in doing so for more than two months.
   Both cases tapped into white fears and the stereotype of a
ruthless, marauding black man, even though Horton's furlough was
one of many and Carol Stuart was much more likely to be killed by
her husband than by a black stranger.
   Researchers and civil libertarians say the images of American
blacks, once obviously racist portrayals of blacks as dim-witted,
carefree or dangerous, are more subtle these days _ but no less
persuasive or damaging.
   ``There's no question race is being used more often as a
political tool,'' said Harvard University law professor Alan
Dershowitz. ``Race is used and exploited in politics. It
corresponds to people's fears, and it's being used on both sides.''
   Patricia Turner, a professor of black studies at the University
of Massachusetts in Boston, traces negative portrayals of blacks in
popular culture since before the Civil War.
   ``Back then, blacks were shown as docile and contented, simple
people who weren't really up to the demands of the white world,''
Turner says. ``They were seen as people who danced and sang all
night, and then were too tired to get up for work the next
morning.''
   This ``dancing darkie'' image alternated with the Uncle Tom, the
benevolent, kindly old black man, Turner said. But the fear
associated with Willie Horton is rooted in an image that gained
currency after the Civil War.
   This was the ``buck,'' an aggressive, hostile young black man
seen as wanting to molest white women. ``Often, the buck was
dressed in black, and carried some sort of razor or knife, and was
set in juxtaposition to a white woman,'' Turner said.
   Charles Stuart said his assailant was a black man in a black
jogging suit, noted Turner, who helped research ``Ethnic Notions,''
a public televison documentary on the distorted image of blacks in
American popular culture.
   The film shows a scene from D.W. Griffith's 1915 silent movie,
``Birth of a Nation,'' in which a white actor in blackface menaces
a young white woman. Instead of letting herself be raped, she jumps
from a cliff to her death.
   The buck image resurfaced whenever whites felt threatened by
blacks: after the abolition of slavery, after World War I when
returning black soldiers had heightened expectations of their place
in American society, and during the civil rights movement of the
1960s.
   The images, though unreal, had very real consequences.
   ``One of the main reasons black men were lynched was that white
men thought they wanted to rape white women,'' said Dr. Alvin
Poussaint, a Harvard Medical School psychiatrist. ``That's been a
white American preoccupation.''
   In the 1988 presidential battle between George Bush and Gov.
Michael Dukakis, a Bush TV commercial showed a mug shot of a
glowering Horton and implied Dukakis supported freeing convicted
murderers for weekend furloughs.
   Critics said the commercials incited racial fears among whites
and played on racist attitudes and biases.
   Last year, Stuart's account of being attacked by a black man
used invoked the same negative racial image, and his account led
police to stop and search black males in Boston's inner city.
   ``Race was used in both cases as a political tool,'' said state
Rep. Byron Rushing of Boston, a black lawmaker. ``The idea of the
negative black icon is so well known, people can only use it in a
cold and calculated manner. It's not a matter of someone saying
`oops.'''
   ``The president rode Willie Horton into the White House. It
wasn't relevant to his ability to lead,'' said Louis Elisa,
president of the Boston chapter of the NAACP. ``Race has become the
easiest way to pass on fear.''

<HEAD>Boston Archbishop Leaves for Cuba Trip</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archbishop Cardinal Bernard Law, departing Sunday
for a three-day visit to Cuba, said he consulted with President
Bush about recent hints at reform dropped by Cuba's Communist Party.
   ``The president is very interested in what my impressions will
be of this trip,'' said Law, who spoke with Bush on Saturday. The
Roman Catholic prelate has formed a strong friendship with the
president in recent years.
   Law, who is scheduled to meet with Cuban Archbishop Jaime Ortega
and other Cuban bishops on Tuesday, said he would welcome the
chance to meet with Cuban leader Fidel Castro, but no meeting
between them is planned.
   Law's departure came a day after Cuba's hard-line Communist
party called for a party congress next year and hinted that it
might consider some political and economic reforms.
   ``Obviously, a change would benefit everyone,'' Law said. ``For
them to develop some kind of rhetorical diversity would be very
significant.''
   Law met with Castro on previous trips to Cuba in 1985 and 1989,
and while he said no meeting was scheduled with the Cuban leader
this time around, he would welcome the chance to have one.
   Law said the trip's main purpose was to strengthen ties between
the Catholic Church in the United States and in Cuba. More than 40
percent of Cuba's 10 million people are Catholic.
   Castro has been one of the Communist world's staunchest holdouts
and has criticized the democratic reforms that have swept out Old
Guard Communist leaders in Eastern Europe over the past year.
   On Jan. 28, Castro that Cuba would stick to orthodox Communism
even if its longtime ally, the Soviet Union, cut off $5 billion a
year in aid.

<HEAD>Ranking ANC Leader Appeals To Whites For Support</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top-ranking exiled leader of
the African National Congress, in an unprecedented interview shown
Sunday on state-run television, appealed to whites to help build a
post-apartheid South Africa.
   Thabo Mbeki, the ANC's equivalent of a foreign minister, told
viewers they had been the victims of a prolonged misinformation
campaign that depicted his organization as seeking to impose a
communist-style one-party state.
   ``What has inspired the ANC for all these 70-plus years of its
existence has been the vision of a South Africa that belongs to all
the people,'' Mbeki said from Lusaka, Zambia, the group's
headquarters. ``If they acted together, they could transform this
country into something great.''
   It was the first time the South African Broadcasting Corp. has
conducted and broadcast its own in-depth interview with one of the
ANC's exiled leaders.
   On Thursday, it carried an interview by two of its reporters
with Nelson Mandela, the ANC leader freed Feb. 11 after 27 years in
prison.
   Until Feb. 2, when President F.W. de Klerk lifted a 30-year ban
on the ANC, it was a crime for South African media to quote Mbeki
and other senior ANC leaders.
   Asked about de Klerk's peace initiative, aimed at starting
negotiations on a new constitution, Mbeki replied: ``The road ahead
is still a long road, with lots of problems in front of us. But
hopefully the doors to a political settlement of this problem have
been opened.''
   ``What white South Africa needs to do is to join the process of
ending the apartheid system,'' he said. ``Presumably these people
who acted together to change the past would have confidence enough
in one another to build the future.''
   He said whites have ``a very, very wrong perception of the ANC,
the result of many decades of misinformation ... that the ANC is
some communist-dominated group whose intention is to impose itself
on the people of South Africa with a one-party state, that it's
going to destroy the economy.''
   ``It is important that the ANC should not be demonized in the
eyes of the people,'' Mbeki said.
   He said he was not surprised at a backlash among right-wing
whites opposed to de Klerk's reforms.
   ``A lot of white South Africans like the idea of political power
being monopolized by the whites,'' he said. ``It is important that
this small minority should not be given a right of veto, not be
treated as a force to block change which the overwhelming majority
of our people want.''
   He said conservative whites ``need to be convinced that they as
individuals, as families, will be better off in a situation where
they don't have to be guarding their houses with guard dogs, arming
themselves ... living in a situation of conflict and fear.''
   On Friday, the ANC executive committee said in Lusaka it would
send a delegation to South Africa for talks with de Klerk on how to
remove obstacles to full negotiations on a new constitution.
   Mbeki is expected to be in the delegation, which will likely be
joined by by Mandela and other ANC leaders based in South Africa.
   De Klerk has lifted bans on the ANC and other opposition groups,
said political exiles can come home and made other concessions that
met many of the ANC's pre-conditions for negotiations.
   The ANC is still demanding the lifting of the state of
emergency, which has been in effect since June 1986, and the
release of all political prisoners, including those convicted of
acts of violence.
   De Klerk says the issue of prisoner releases could be a matter
for negotiations, and there is speculation he might lift the
emergency in exchange for a suspension of violence by the ANC.
   The ANC has waged a bombing and sabotage campaign since 1961
aimed at ending white-minority domination. There have been few
attacks in the past year and the campaign has posed minimal
military threat to the government.

<HEAD>Administration Budget Would Revive 1980s Waste, Dingell Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN FLESHER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration's fiscal 1991 budget
would repeat wasteful mistakes of the previous decade by rushing
weapon systems into production without adequate testing, Rep. John
Dingell says.
   ``When we look at our military procurement strategy, it still
reflects the thinking of the early 1980s,'' Dingell, chairman of
the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said in a Feb. 9 letter to
President Bush made public Sunday.
   The Michigan Democrat said $10 billion to $20 billion could be
trimmed from Bush's proposed $292 billion defense budget by
delaying the purchase of weapons in need of further research and
testing, including a Navy attack submarine and destroyer and the
Air Force's B-2 bomber.
   Pentagon spokeswoman Chris Cimko said she had not seen the
letter and could not comment. White House spokesman Doug Davidson
also said he could not comment.
   As the United States underwent its biggest military buildup
since World War II in the early 1980s, the Pentagon's weapon
acquisition policy ``was geared toward getting major weapons
systems produced and fielded today, not tomorrow,'' Dingell wrote.
   ``The primary method for expediting these procurements was to
rush the systems into production prior to the completion of design,
engineering and testing. This process of concurrency, or buy before
you fly, has resulted in untold waste.''
   In the worst case, the Reagan administration contracted to buy
100 B1-B bombers for more than $20 billion before the plane was
properly tested and evaluated, Dingell said.
   Air Force officials testified before Dingell's oversight and
investigations subcommittee in 1986 that the bomber had major
technical problems that crippled its ability to penetrate Soviet
airspace. But the planes had been paid for by then, Dingell said.
   Bush's budget would continue rapid procurement, which no longer
is justified with the dramatic improvement in East-West relations,
he said.
   ``Not only have the concurrency lessons of the B-1 and other
programs gone unheeded, but the defense establishment now more than
ever is attempting aggressively to produce systems before the
designs are completed and adequately tested,'' he said.
   He described these items in Bush's budget as unduly hasty:
   _Two SSN-21 Sea Wolf attack submarines for $3.7 billion. The
Navy eventually wants 29 of the subs for $37 billion. Under the
current schedule, production of more than half would be under way
at a cost of $20 billion before the first new sub undergoes sea
trials, Dingell said.
   _Five Navy DDG-51 Arleigh Burke destroyers for $3.7 billion as
part of an eventual 33-ship, $27 billion program. As with the
SSN-21, the Navy will have contracted for production of more than
half, costing $15 billion, before initial sea trials.
   _Five B-2 Stealth bombers for $5.5 billion. The Air Force
envisions a 132-aircraft, $75 billion fleet but it may be scaled
back to between 30 and 50 planes. The 1991 budget would boost the
number approved for production to 20 although tests have shown only
that the plane will fly, Dingell said.
   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, has discovered major cost, schedule and production
problems with all three of the weapon systems, he said.
   Numerous other systems in the budget would be produced with
insufficient testing, he said, including the C-17 cargo plane, the
Mark-50 torpedo, the TF-45 trainer, the AN-BSY-1 and AN-BSY-2
submarine combat systems and the AMRAAM air-to-air missile.
   Deleting the questionable expenditures from the budget pending
satisfactory test results would save up to $20 billion, Dingell
said.
   Some argue that slowing production would boost costs, but such
increases would be offset by ensuring that weapon systems are built
correctly the first time and avoiding investment in systems that
don't deliver as promised, he said.

   Voter outrage over Japan's worst postwar political
scandal appeared to have subsided by Sunday's national election,
when leading conservative politicians won re-election despite their
ties to the case.
   ``A general election is a judgment by the people, and I
passed,'' said former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, one of many
linked to the widespread influence-peddling scandal named for the
information conglomerate Recruit Co.
   Dozens of influential politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen
gained millions of dollars in donations or profits from cut-rate
stock offered by Recruit.
   Noboru Takeshita resigned as prime minister to take
responsibility for the scandal, and his successor, Sousuke Uno,
stepped down after only two months because of election setbacks
last July stemming from the Recruit case and an unpopular sales
tax. Uno also was embarrassed by a former geisha who said he had
paid her to be his mistress.
   Nakasone left the governing Liberal Democratic Party in
disgrace, and several other prominent Liberal Democrats who
received money from Recruit stepped out of competition for the
prime minister's post.
   But the only Recruit-linked candidate who lost Sunday was Kunio
Takaishi, a former vice minister of education who is under
indictment for bribery. Takaishi, 59, bought 10,000 shares of
Recruit-Cosmos, a Recruit real estate subsidiary, reselling most of
it for a handsome profit.
   Caught lying on national TV in 1988 about his stock purchase, he
decided last year against running for Parliament, but changed his
mind again in December. Late Sunday, police arrested one of his
private secretaries on charges of handing out cash to voters.
   All but two other Recruit-tainted Liberal Democrats were
declared winners within hours after the polls closed.
   ``The election results are a significant verdict of the people
according to the constitution,'' Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu told
reporters outside his official residence. ``It is a form of
purification.''
   The opposition was quick to challenge Kaifu's interpretation.
   ``Simply being elected does not mean one is absolved,''
Socialist Secretary-General Tsuruo Yamaguchi said. ``The need for
political reform is bigger than ever.''
   Koshiro Ishida, chairman of the Komeito (Clean Government
Party), added, ``There has been no `purification.' I'd like to know
how the Liberal Democrats plan to take responsibility (for corrupt
politics).''
   Candidates linked to the Recruit scandal who were returned to
office included:
   _ Takeshita, 65. An aide and a relative were sold Recruit-Cosmos
stocks at bargain prices, which they resold at a profit of some
$172,000. Takeshita later acknowledged receiving more than $896,000
in political donations from Recruit, as well as a $344,000 loan.
Three Cabinet ministers under Takeshita resigned because of stock
or money links to Recruit. Takeshita himself announced his
resignation last April.
   _ Nakasone, 71, who was prime minister when the transactions
occurred. Nakasone's aides reportedly received 29,000
Recruit-Cosmos shares, which they later resold for a $414,000
profit.
   ``The mass media reported falsehoods about me, but the people of
Gunma prefecture made the proper decision,'' Nakasone said in a TV
interview after his re-election was assured. ``I feel the voice of
Gunma reflects the voice of all the people.''
   _ Uno, 67. While not directly linked to the scandal, Uno was
forced to step down as prime minister to assume resonsibility for
the Liberal Democrats' loss of their upper house majority in
elections last July.
   _ Former Finance Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa, 70. One of the Cabinet members forced to step down,
Miyazawa also lost his position in line as a possible successor to
Takeshita.
   _ Shintaro Abe, 65, the most likely successor to Takeshita a
year ago. Abe's secretary was found to have purchased
Recruit-Cosmos stocks. Even before the election, he showed signs of
a comeback in a heavily publicized visit to the Soviet Union.
   _ Takao Fujinami, 57, who was chief Cabinet secretary in
Nakasone's administration. Fujinami also is under indictment on
bribery charges. He received $138,000 and 10,000 Recruit-Cosmos
shares.
   Other Recruit-linked incumbents who were returned to their seats
included former Finance Minister Michio Watanabe, ex-Defense Agency
chief Koichi Kato, former Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato,
ex-Education Minister Yoshiro Mori and two other Liberal Democrats;
former chairman of the opposition Democratic Socialist Party Saburo
Tsukamoto, and Socialist Takuzo Ueda.

   Defense and Foreign Ministry officials were
engaged in a sharp dispute Sunday over the role of the NATO
alliance in a united Germany.
   Defense Ministry officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,
stressed that NATO's security umbrella should extend over what is
now East German territory. The same proposal was made Friday by
Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg.
   Foreign Ministry officials said that Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher was ``deeply disappointed'' by Stoltenberg's
remarks. They also spoke on condition of anonymity.
   In a radio interview Saturday, Genscher ruled out extending
NATO's territory to what is now East Germany.
   Genscher believes that Stoltenberg's suggestions, under which a
united Germany would belong to NATO and German troops could be
based throughout the country, could hinder talks on unification
with the Soviet Union, United States, Britain and France, Foreign
Ministry officials said.
   They said he intends to bring up the matter at a Cabinet meeting
this week.
   West Germany's army has about 490,000 soldiers, while East
Germany has 170,000 soldiers. In addition, 380,000 Soviet troops
are stationed in East Germany, while NATO has more than 300,000
soldiers in West Germany.
   The Soviet Union is taking a hard line on German unification,
demanding it not be a member of NATO and emphasizing that Moscow
seeks a reduction in the reunited country's armed forces.
   However, two top Western officials said Sunday that the Soviet
Union may ultimately accept full NATO membership for a reunified
Germany because it would provide stability that is in Moscow's own
interests.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Manfred Woerner,
secretary-general of the Western alliance, said they do not believe
objections to full NATO membership voiced by some Soviet officials
are the final word.
   ``We're going to have to see the degree to which they really
feel that way,'' Baker said on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David
Brinkley.'' ``For myself, I would tell you that I'm not so sure
that they really strongly feel that way.''
   Baker said the alliance, as the basis for the presence of U.S.
troops in Europe, is something that few on either side of the
former Iron Curtain want to dissolve in the current unstable
climate in Eastern Europe.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Sunday an
agreement on German unification must respect existing borders in
Europe and the rights of the four Allied powers.
   Mrs. Thatcher, who is uneasy about rapid moves toward German
unification, said she hoped a united Germany would remain part of
NATO, with American troops stationed there, ``with some special
arrangements for East Germany to meet the Soviet Union's security
concerns. Indeed, it would be quite reasonable for some Soviet
troops to remain there at least for a transitional period.''

<HEAD>Judge Approves $30 Million Settlement In Monongahela River Fuel
Spill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 20 class-action lawsuits filed against
Ashland Oil Inc. for a 1988 diesel fuel spill that disrupted water
service in three states have been settled out of court for $30
million.
   U.S. District Judge D. Brooks Smith approved the settlement
Friday and awarded $4.6 million in fees to the 28 law firms that
brought the litigation.
   At a hearing, Smith said it was fortunate the case was being
settled out of court because there is a shortage of federal judges
available to take cases in the region.
   Thomas Donovan, a lawyer for Ashland, described the agreement as
``eminently fair and reasonable.'' Howard Specter, one of the
plaintiffs' lawyers, said the agreement was ``hard fought'' and
``hard earned.''
   The terms Smith approved are identical to those in a preliminary
settlement filed in November.
   The agreement, which takes effect in 30 days, settles lawsuits
filed after the collapse of a storage tank Jan. 2, 1988, at
Ashland's Floreffe terminal in Jefferson, about 25 miles south of
Pittsburgh.
   About 700,000 gallons of diesel fuel spilled into the
Monongahela River, killing thousands of fish and birds and forcing
water systems in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio to stop
drawing water from the Monongahela and Ohio rivers as the fuel made
its way downstream.
   A panel appointed by Gov. Robert P. Casey concluded Ashland was
negligent in erecting a tank of substandard steel and filling it
without proper testing and review.
   Although the overall value of the settlement is $30 million, $14
million of that already has been spent or committed for civil
penalties, natural resource damages and expenses incurred by the
plaintiffs.
   Of the other $16 million, $4.6 million will go for attorneys'
fees and $560,000 for the attorneys' costs and for expenses in
administering the settlement.
   That leaves nearly $11 million for claims by individuals and
businesses for lost wages, lost sales, property damage and loss or
reduction of water supplies.
   Ashland officials, however, do not expect claims to total that
much because the company previously settled about 5,000 claims.
   David Berger, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said the legal fees
were justified by the complexity and intensity of the case.
   Ashland officials say insurance covers the $30 million
settlement, a separate federal criminal fine of $2.25 million and
$11 million in cleanup costs. The oil company, based in Ashland,
Ky., had to make a $2.5 million deductible payment.
   Ashland has not disclosed its legal expenses or the costs of
environmental studies it commissioned for the litigation.

<TEXT>
   The United Nations opens a special session
Tuesday on the international anti-drug war, seeking ways to cut
supplies, reduce demand, and undo traffickers' schemes for
laundering profits.
   But it is unclear if the world body can make a dent in the
problem when it is so badly strapped for funds.
   ``The funds that we have at our disposal are extremely limited
in relation to the problem,'' said Margaret Anstee,
director-general of the U.N. office in Vienna and coordinator of
U.N. drug programs in an interview. ``In the area of drugs, we are
being asked to do much more with less.''
   She said it is estimated that the illegal world drug trade
brings in $500 billion annually, second only to the international
arms trade. The United Nations has set aside about $4 million a
year to fight its drug war, Ms. Antsee said.
   ``As people have often pointed out, that is probably less than
the cost of a suitcase full of heroine at any airport in Europe,''
she said.
   U.N. officials and diplomats say the four-day U.N. session is
expected to conclude with a global plan to fight drugs and measures
to enhance the U.N. role in that effort.
   The illicit drug trade and related social problems plague
nations rich and poor, large and small. But while there is general
agreement that a global attack is needed, members of the 159-member
world body plan to stress differing approaches and concerns.
   The United States will press for other countries, particularly
in Europe, to contribute more money for the international offensive.
   U.S. officials see the U.N. session as an important follow-up to
a regional drug summit attended by President Bush last week in
Colombia. However, they also plan to stress that the drug scourge
is not limited to the United States and Latin American countries.
   Colombia, under siege by powerful drug cartels and crippled by
economic woes, seeks preferential treatment in the global
marketplace so it can continue its anti-drug fight and encourage
farmers to switch to legal crops.
   For its part, Cuba wants to ensure its sovereignty is not
violated by heightened law enforcement as part of an international
attack on drug trafficking.
   ``Cuba and hopefully other countries will press for
international law to be followed and the sovereignty of nations to
be respected so these are not violated under the protection of
fighting narcotics trafficking,'' said Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada,
Cuba's U.N. ambassador.
   A Cuban freighter was hit at least twice by fire from a U.S.
Coast Guard cutter Jan. 31 when its crew refused to allow a search.
U.S. authorities suspected the vessel was involved in drug
smuggling.
   At the Colombia summit Thursday, the presidents of the United
States, Colombia, Bolivia and Peru signed a communique vowing
closer coordination in the drug fight.
   They called for a world conference against illicit drug
trafficking in 1991 and a high-level Latin American follow-up in
six months.
   Their agreements commit the U.S. government to provide economic
aid to help the three Andean nations wage the drug battle and
persuade their farmers to grow alternate crops to the coca plant,
which is used in producing cocaine.
   Their communique also calls for tougher enforcement of drug laws
and increased international gun control.

<TEXT>
   The remains of Gen. Omar Torrijos,
Panama's former military leader who died in a 1981 plane crash,
were transferred to another crypt, a family member said Sunday.
   Torrijos' remains were dug up Saturday from the mausoleum at
Fort Amador, a joint U.S.-Panamanian facility, and placed in a
crypt at the National Shrine alongside the cremated remains of his
parents, said his daughter, Raquel Torrijos.
   She said she decided to move her father's remains ``to avoid
desecration of his tomb.''
   The Torrijos family has said it was worried that Panama's new
government might decide to eliminate the masoleum where the remains
had been held, although the government has denied having any such
plans. The leadership in the present government dislikes Torrijos.
   On Oct. 11, 1968, he overthrew the elected government of Arnulfo
Arias.
   His rule is best remembered for the Panama Canal Treaties he
signed in 1977 with former President Jimmy Carter. They hand over
control of the canal to Panama before the end of the century.
   Torrijos died July 31, 1981, when a Panamanian military plane
exploded. The crash was officially listed as an accident, but
Torrijos' brother has accused the CIA of murdering the former
leader. A former Panamanianmilitary official in 1987 accused Manuel
Antonio Noriega of having masterminded Torrijos' death.
   Noriega, who was Torrijos' successor as head of the nation's
Defense Forces, was overthrown in the Dec. 20 military invasion by
the United States.

<HEAD>Computerized Library to Help Third World Boost Trade</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World Bank has developed a computerized
library designed to help Third World governments increase their
economic competitiveness on international markets.
   ``The idea is to provide developing countries with something
more like a level playing field when they're negotiating with
countries that have huge computer systems of their own,'' said Sam
Laird, an Australian economist at the bank who has taken a major
part in working out the system.
   For example, when an American investor suggests building a new
widget factory in Bhutan or Burundi, a cabinet minister in that
country could use the system to find out what countries have been
supplying this device to Japan, and whether they have been
receiving any special breaks.
   The computerized file would also give tariff rates, point the
way to finding out Japan's special import rules and suggest other
possible markets. Pressing another button would calculate how many
more widgets Japan might buy if its government could be persuaded
to cut the tariff in half.
   The program is called ``SMART'' _ Software for Market Analysis
and Restrictions on Trade.
   Designed for use by governments, SMART does not contain data
about individual companies and is not being made available to them.
   ``In this country, you'd probably be able to get it through the
Freedom of Information Act,'' Laird suggested.
   Some countries have furnished information they consider
confidential. So far the system has been loaded with data from the
United States and other major industrial areas, the markets that
Third World countries most want to hit, and from Mexico, South
Korea and Hong Kong.
   Though SMART is not generally meant for richer governments,
Laird said many are using it _ including the Agriculture and
Commerce Departments in this country, and the European Economic
Community.
   Laird said that when he demonstrated it to one official in
Switzerland, the official said he had been trying for three months
to collect one set of data shown him.
   Laird noted that some Third World governments have been
unwilling to participate in the set of worldwide trade talks called
the ``Uruguay round,'' now going on. Giving them more information
would further the policies of the United States and other major
trading countries that are trying to stimulate their interest, he
added.
   With the help of the United Nations, the World Bank, the biggest
source of aid to Third World countries, is offering governments the
necessary half dozen computer diskettes for about $50, to cover the
cost of the material. They are also giving demonstrations to
interested governments: one for French-speaking Africans in April
in Morocco, another later for English-speaking countries in Kenya,
and many others all over the world.
   The diskettes can be loaded into a low-priced personal computer.
Laird said his own computer cost about $1,000, and SMART used up
only about a quarter of its capacity. The information will be
updated every year.
   Part of the data now available is two or three years old because
more recent figures have not been published.

   The Soviet Union may ultimately accept full
NATO membership for a reunified Germany because it would provide
stability that is in Moscow's own interests, two top Western
officials said Sunday.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Manfred Woerner,
secretary general of the Western alliance, said they do not believe
objections to full NATO membership voiced by some Soviet officials
are the final word.
   ``We're going to have to see the degree to which they really
feel that way,'' Baker said on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David
Brinkley'' program. ``For myself, I would tell you that I'm not so
sure that they really strongly feel that way.''
   Baker said the alliance, as the basis for the presence of U.S.
troops in Europe, is something that few on either side of the
former Iron Curtain want to dissolve in the current unstable
climate in Eastern Europe.
   ``I think, without putting words in the mouths of the Soviets,
that they see the stability that is afforded by the continued
presence of United States forces in Europe,'' he said.
   On Saturday, a top adviser to Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev, Valentin Falin, said in a radio interview monitored in
West Berlin that if the Western alliance insists on ``NATO
membership for all of Germany, then there won't be any German
unification.''
   The statement underscored what has appeared to be a hardening of
the Soviet position against NATO membership for a united Germany
and the prospects for an impasse as the two sides begin the
so-called two plus four discussions among the two Germanys and the
allied powers associated with them: the United States, France,
Britain and the Soviet Union.
   Woerner, also speaking on the ABC-TV program Sunday, was even
more direct.
   ``I think the Russians will accept such a solution, of course
under one condition: that we give them a clear guarantee this is
not turning against them,'' he said.
   ``What you see at this very moment is a kind of tactical play,
which is very natural,'' Woerner added, contending that Gorbachev
himself has made no firm commitment on the question of German
alignment.
   ``He was very cautious and noncommittal on that, and you have
very different and vague responses from high Soviet leaders,'' said
Woerner.
   ``So I think if they really think their own legitimate security
interests through, it will be better for them to have a Germany
which is in a stable condition and is firmly embedded in safety and
security structures, than to have a neutral Germany floating around
trying to form alliances,'' Woerner said.
   Without an anchor in NATO, Woerner added, a neutral Germany
would ``revert into national rivalries'' of the sort which led to
World Wars I and II, ``and we want that not to happen again.''
   Both Baker and Woerner repeated assurances that under NATO
membership, military forces of the alliance would not be advanced
into what is now East Germany.
   The discussions are likely to be driven ahead faster than either
side is prepared for because of economic discontent in the East and
a flow of fortune-seekers across the border to the West.
   ``Unification is taking place as we sit here this morning, on
the ground, economically,'' Baker said. ``There is de facto
economic integration, unification, taking place,'' he said, adding
that there is ``an excellent chance'' that the two Germanys will be
back together before the year is out.
   Horst Teltschik, foreign policy adviser to West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, also predicted that unification would occur
this year.
   ``Nobody can slow down that process, neither the Soviets nor we,
because the people in East Germany are the only ones who are
responsible (for) what will happen,'' he said on the CBS program
``Face the Nation.''
   Teltschik said the German Democratic Republic is near economic
collapse and its Western neighbor expects 100,000 immigrants this
month alone. ``This is a development the GDR can't survive,'' he

   Character actor Erik Rhodes, who twice
shared the silver screen with Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, has
died at age 84.
   Rhodes, who died Saturday at an Oklahoma City nursing home,
played Italian characters in the Rogers-Astaire classics ``The Gay
Divorcee,'' in 1934 and ``Top Hat'' in 1935.
   Rhodes was born in El Reno in 1906 and later moved to Oklahoma
City, where he graduated from high school. He earned a modern
languages degree in 1927 from the University of Oklahoma before
launching his acting career.
   Rhodes' stage career included ``Shin Bone Alley,'' ``Jamaica,''
``How to Make a Man,'' ``Song of Norway,'' and ``The King and I.''
   His wife Emala Dunbar died in 1984, and he left no survivors, a
funeral home spokesman said.

   The deaths of 11 bottlenose dolphins
during the past month in waters near the Florida-Alabama line have
mystified a scientist who examined the carcasses.
   ``Eleven in one month is historic, if not significant,'' said
Gerald Regan, a biology professor at Spring Hill College in Mobile,
Ala., and a member of the National Marine Mammal Stranding Network.
   Until now, an average of only 12 dead dolphins a year has turned
up in Perdido Bay, which separates Alabama from the Florida
Panhandle, and in adjacent waters of the Gulf of Mexico, Regan said
Saturday.
   The cause of the deaths hasn't been determined. Regan said he is
awaiting an analysis of lung samples sent to the Sea World Research
Institute in Orlando before drawing any conclusions.
   Some members of a local environmental group have blamed
pollution.
   The Lillian, Ala.-based Perdido Bay Environmental Association is
collecting donations to pay for the laboratory tests on the dead
dolphins, said group Vice President Jo Ann Allen.
   She said there is growing concern about the impact that
pollution from sewage treatment plants and paper mills has had on
the bay.
   However, Regan said that at this point he knows more about what
didn't kill the animals than what did.
   He said he didn't think the dolphins died of violence from
people or from choking on debris, such as plastic bags. ``We
haven't found any scars or cuts,'' the biologist said.
   Regan also has ruled out starvation because all the dolphins had
food in their stomachs, and crossed off old age because the victims
have been of various sizes.
   He said he didn't believe the dolphins were killed by a December
freeze because the first dead animal didn't turn up until long
after the cold snap.
   One theory is that the dolphins may have suffered from a virus
that affected their immune systems, said Jacqueline Lane, a biology
instructor at Pensacola Junior College.
   Dolphins also have been dying for unexplained reasons in the
Atlantic Ocean, she pointed out. Sea World's research branch has
joined others in looking into those deaths as well.
   A two-year study on pollution in Perdido Bay being conducted by
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency may turn up some clues in
the dolphin deaths, said Jim Clark, a research aquatic biologist at
the agency's Pensacola Beach laboratory.

<HEAD>Building For Convent To Start Year After Deadline For Moving
Auschwitz Nuns</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Construction is to begin Monday on a
religious center to house Roman Catholic nuns who have outraged
many Jews by refusing to leave a convent at the edge of the
Auschwitz death camp.
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki and Edgar Bronfman, president
of the World Jewish Congress, are to announce the start of building
after meeting in Warsaw, spokesmen said.
   The groundbreaking will come nearly a year after the Feb. 22,
1989, deadline for moving the nuns under a 1987 accord reached by
Catholic and Jewish religious leaders in Geneva.
   Jewish groups and others view the presence of the small group of
Carmelite nuns as an offensive intrusion of Christianity at the
death camp, built by the Nazis mainly to exterminate Jews because
of their religion.
   Despite the Geneva agreement, the Polish church _ with backing
from other quarters in overwhelmingly Catholic Poland _ balked at
moving the nuns from a former theater used by the Nazis as a
warehouse to store Zyklon B cylinders for the gas chambers.
   After international outcry grew, the Vatican intervened and
announced its support for the construction of the religious center.
It will be a quarter-mile from the death camp on a nine-acre site,
the official news agency PAP said Sunday.
   The presence of the Auschwitz convent represents a ``most, most
serious issue'' to the international Jewish community, which is
prepared to assist in transforming post-Communist Poland's
shattered economy, said Marem Stern, political consultant to the
World Jewish Conference.
   ``It is not that we are anti-Polish ... but it is an issue that
has to be solved, and quickly because with this whole opening of
Poland we have a lot of Jews who are ready to come here and
invest,'' Stern said in a Sunday interview.
   Bronfman will tell Mazowiecki that help is ready, ``but he will
also have to explain that he will not do anything until this is
solved,'' Stern said.
   The convent issue touches on deeply sensitive issues in Poland,
where a pre-World War II Jewish population of 3.5 million has been
reduced to several thousand.
   About 3 million Polish Jews were killed during the war. Most of
those who survived subsequently emigrated, the last wave of
departures taking place after an anti-Semitic political purge in
1968.
   Known officially as the Center for Information, Dialogue,
Education and Prayer at Auschwitz, the new building will include
meeting rooms, exhibition and conference halls, a library and
accommodations for nearly 100 people, PAP said.
   A separate section of the building will house the convent, the
Rev. Marek Glownia said in a statement. The archdiocese of Krakow
appointed Glownia to lead the center and oversee construction.
   The Vatican has pledged financial support for the construction,
and funds also will be raised by foundations and churches elsewhere
in Europe.

   Business leaders expressed relief and predicted a
period of renewed economic stability following the strong showing
by the governing Liberal Democratic Party in parliamentary
elections Sunday.
   ``I'm relieved at the outcome,'' Eiji Suzuki, president of the
Japan Federation of Employers Association, said as the pro-business
LDP appeared headed for a majority in the powerful lower house of
Parliament.
   Some bankers predicted the yen would strengthen against the U.S.
dollar in the election's aftermath. Business leaders said the
results showed public acceptance for a controversial sales tax
adopted by the LDP last year.
   With 431 out of 512 seats decided early Monday, the Liberal
Democrats, who have guided policy for 34 years that turned Japan
into an economic superpower, held 240 seats against 114 by the
largest opposition group, the Socialists.
   ``I can breathe a little easier now that political stability is
secured at least for the time being,'' said Eishiro Saito, chairman
of the powerful Japan Federation of Economic Organizations
(Keidanren).
   Saito said the Liberal Democrats' victory ``is a result of the
nation's choice for political stability,'' Kyodo News Service
reported.
   But Suzuki warned that election gains by the Socialists, who had
83 seats before the election, ``show that the governing party must
carry out political reform as quickly as possible to recover the
people's trust.''
   The Liberal Democrats' popularity plunged to record lows last
year after a series of bribery and sex scandals that led to the
loss of their upper house majority for the first time since their
formation in 1955. Some business leaders had feared that a Liberal
Democratic loss in the lower house would disrupt Japanese economic
growth and stability.
   Worries about the election outcome held volume down on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange most of last week, and have been cited as a major
factor behind the market's weakness since the start of the year.
   Concern about a possible LDP upset also has helped drive up
interest rates sharply in recent weeks and kept the yen weak
against the U.S. dollar, analysts and dealers have said.
   In a survey late Sunday of officials at 22 banks and brokerage
houses, 11 said they believed the election outcome would cause the
yen to rise briefly against the U.S. dollar, three predicted a
longer-term rise by the yen, and eight said the election would have
little effect on exchange rates, the Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK)
said.
   The public television network said 15 of the companies it
contacted predicted the dollar would end the coming week in Tokyo
at about 144-145 yen. Last Friday, the U.S. currency closed in
Tokyo at 144.55 yen.
   Business leaders said the election also showed the public now
accepts an unpopular 3 percent sales tax. Opposition parties have
strongly condemned the tax, which was forced through Parliament a
year ago by the governing party.
   ``The outcome shows that the Liberal Democrats' taxation policy,
including its stance toward the sales tax, has been accepted by the
people,'' Kyodo quoted Rokuro Ishikawa, president of the Japan
Chamber of Commerce and Industry, as saying.
   Opposition leaders said Sunday they plan to introduce a bill
calling for abolition of the tax, which could lead to a
parliamentary stalemate because of the opposition's control of the
upper house.
   The Liberal Democrats also are expected to face problems in
parliament over agriculture and land-price policies and over
growing trade friction with the United States.

   Nadia Comaneci thinks her defection from Romania
may have helped trigger the revolution there, the former Olympic
gymnast says in Life magazine's March issue.
   Comaneci said her flight to the West in November hit her
homeland ``like a bomb. A bomb for the government. Because what
will the people think? That even Nadia leaves Romania.
   ``They thought I had the good life, but I didn't. I lived just
like the others,'' said Comaneci, who won glory for her country
when she scored perfect 10s in the Montreal Olympics in 1976.
   About a month after Comaneci left, Romania's communist
government was overthrown and dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was
executed.
   In the Life interview, Comaneci denied reports that she was the
mistress of Ceausescu's son, Nicu.
   ``Why people are telling these lies?'' she said. ``Because I
work for him at the Young Communist Party _ only to make the money.
And I am famous. I am the famous one. So when people see Nicu and
see me, they think we are lovers only because they know me. All
lies.''
   She and Constantin Panait, a 36-year-old roofer and Romanian
emigree who helped plan her escape, live temporarily in a
one-bedroom apartment in Los Angeles.
   Comaneci said she and Panait, who has a wife in Hallandale,
Fla., don't plan to marry.
   She is fielding various offers and is going to do commercials on
Italian television for household soap and detergent, Life said.
   Comaneci confirmed rumors that she tried to kill herself at the
age of 15 by drinking bleach. She spent two days in the hospital,
and was ``glad because I didn't have to go to the gym,'' she said.

<HEAD>Bush to Invite Gorbachev to Visit Kennebunkport Retreat</HEAD>

   President Bush said Sunday he hopes
to bring Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to visit his
oceanside retreat here during June's superpower summit.
   ``I think he'd enjoy it,'' Bush said, speaking with reporters as
he and his wife Barbara enjoyed a brisk hour-long walk on the beach.
   Bush also said he continues to believe that a reunified Germany
should be part of NATO, despite Soviet reservations.
   ``That's our position,'' Bush said.
   Bush was asked about the assertion on Saturday by a top adviser
to Gorbachev, Valentin Falin, that if the Western alliance insists
on ``NATO membership for all of Germany, then there won't be any
German unification.''
   ``There will be a lot of discussions before now and the event,''
Bush said. ``We have our position supporting (West German)
Chancellor (Helmut) Kohl. We know what Kohl's position is. We're
just going to stay with it.''
   Kohl has said that a reunified Germany should be part of NATO,
but that he would not advocate stationing troops in the part that
is now East Germany.
   The president and his wife strode quickly along nearly deserted
Goose Rocks Beach in subfreezing temperatures. The late afternoon
outing was the second day Bush has taken what he is calling ``power
walks.''
   The sandy beach is about five miles north along the coastline
from Bush's oceanfront home.
   Asked if he would bring Gorbachev to Maine during June's
superpower summit, Bush said: ``If we can do it.''
   As president, Bush already has had three heads of state to his
Walker's Point home: French Prime Minister Francois Mitterrand,
Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and Danish Prime Minister
Poul Schluter.
   At Bush's last session with Gorbachev, at Malta in December,
high seas forced all the sessions to be held aboard the Soviet
luxury liner Gorky at dockside instead of on U.S. and Soviet naval
ships at anchor, as originally planned.
   Asked if Gorbachev liked boats and the water, Bush _ who keeps a
speedboat at his vacation retreat _ said: ``We never found out _
couldn't prove it at Malta.''
   However, Bush said he had not yet formally invited Gorbachev to
come.
   On another topic, Bush said he had ``no recollection'' of former
President Carter being given authority to negotiate a deal with
former Panamanian dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega in May 1989 while
Carter was an unofficial observer of that country's presidential
election.
   Bush expressed surprise at the former president's statement.
   In a speech in Minneapolis on Saturday, Carter said he had been
authorized to try to persuade Noriega to step down with a promise
that he would not be extradited to the United States. Carter did
not say who authorized him to negotiate with Noriega, but Robert
Pastor, Carter's former national security adviser on Latin America,
said the former president had ``consulted with senior levels of the
U.S. government.''
   Bush is returning to Washington late Monday afternoon.

<HEAD>Mubarak, Gadhafi Hold Fourth Meeting Since Improving Relations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former archenemies Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi and President Hosni Mubarak on Sunday discussed Arab and
African issues, Egypt's government-run news agency said.
   It was the leaders' fourth summit meeting since relations
between their neighboring north African countries started improving
last year.
   However, Libya remains the only Arab state that has not
officially resumed diplomatic relations with Egypt, severed in 1979
to protest the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty.
   The Middle East News Agency quoted Information Minister Safwat
el-Sherif as saying the leaders met privately for two hours and
then had a working lunch.
   El-Sherif said they discussed ``Arab issues, especially the
developments of the Palestinian issue ... also the deteriorating
situation in Lebanon ... (and) African issues.''
   Following the talks, Mubarak said he would present an Egyptian
suggestion for the resettlement of Soviet Jews during his meeting
next month with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Mubarak did not elaborate but said the issue would top his
agenda for the meeting.
   Israel's settling of Soviet Jews in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip _ which it captured in the 1967 Middle East war _ has
angered Arabs.
   Many believe the influx of Soviet Jews, expected to reach
300,000 over the next three years, will drive Palestinians out of
their land and damage chances for peace.
   ``This land is Arab land and is under dispute, it is very wrong
of Israel to act on its own concerning this subject,'' the news
agency quoted Mubarak as saying.
   Mubarak said he has sent messages on the issue to Gorbachev and
to President Bush, as has Egypt's Foreign Minister Esmat
Abdel-Meguid to his Israeli counterpart, Moshe Arens.
   Mubarak and Gadhafi met again later Sunday with other officials
from both countries.
   The Middle East News Agency said Mubarak welcomed Gadhafi in the
southern resort city of Aswan, 580 miles south of Cairo.
   The Libyan leader was given an official welcoming ceremony at
the airport, followed by a popular welcome by Egyptians who cheered
him and Mubarak as they drove to the Soviet-built Aswan High Dam.
   The Mubarak and Gadhafi summits have taken place outside their
countries' capitals since the Libyan leader refuses to visit Cairo
as long as the Israeli flag flies over it.
   Egyptian media reports had said this summit had been scheduled
to take place in the Sinai peninsula. Officials have declined to
comment on the reason for the change of venue, but the opposition
newspaper el-Wafd said Saturday the plans were changed for security
reasons after an armed attack two weeks ago on an Israeli tourist
bus en route from Israel through the Sinai to Cairo.
   Nine Israelis were killed and 21 were wounded in the attackm,
which authorities say is linked to Palestinian terrorists.
   The news agency said Mubarak and Gadhafi would visit the Sinai
briefly Monday after spending the night in Aswan. Gadhafi's trip
was expected to last 24 hours.
   Following a meeting in December, Egypt and Libya agreed to build
roads connecting oases, share television programs and cooperate in
agricultural and industrial projects.
   Egypt and Libya had been bitter enemies since Mubarak's
predecessor, Anwar Sadat, refused a bid by Gadhafi to unify their
countries in 1972.
   Relations continued to deteriorate and the countries fought a
brief border war in 1977.

   A railroad tank car full of propane burned
through the day Sunday, a day after derailment of a train carrying
hazardous chemicals touched off an explosion and forced several
families to leave their homes.
   Firefighters decided after the accident Saturday to let the
propane burn itself out, rather than risk touching off another
explosion by dousing unseen hot spots in the car, said Capt.
Darrell Stevenson of the Corsicana Fire Department.
   No one was injured.
   Firefighters under the supervision of the Texas Railroad
Commission pumped water into the burning tanker Sunday, forcing the
propane to rise and burn off.
   Stevenson said officials were unsure how much propane was left
in the tanker or how long the fire would burn.
   Several families within a mile of the accident site were
evacuated from their homes Saturday, and all but three of the
families were back home Sunday.
   Investigators haven't been able to get close enough to the
wreckage to determine what caused the 44-car train to lose 24 cars
on a curve shortly before 8:30 a.m. Saturday. The train belongs to
the Burlington Northern railroad.
   A spilled car of sodium chlorate powder caused concerns.
Firefighters said the chemical, used in manufacturing explosives
and cosmetics, could feed the fire, spreading flames beyond the
scattered wreckage in a remote area near Emhouse, a community of
200 about 45 miles south of Dallas.
   The chemical reacts violently with water.
   The three train crew members underwent drug tests, a normal
procedure following train derailments. The results haven't been
made public.

   Demonstrators yelling ``Down with
Communism!'' smashed their way into interim government headquarters
with rocks and iron rods Sunday in the most violent protest since
the December pro-democracy revolution.
   Soldiers fell back before more than 1,000 demonstrators and
about 500 protesters poured inside. An official said not enough
troops were on hand to keep order.
   The state news agency Rompres said more than 20 paratroopers
were severely wounded, but reporters saw only two injured soldiers.
   Hundreds of troop reinforcements arrived and pushed back the
crowd, which numbered around 5,000 at its height, and 10 armored
personnel carriers were positioned in front of the building.
   The army blocked the entrance after allowing many demonstrators
to leave. An infantry captain, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said about 150 people were arrested and remained inside the
building, guarded by soldiers.
   The building on Victory Square has been used by Prime Minister
Petre Roman since the revolution that toppled longtime Communist
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, later executed.
   Roman, who was in Paris on a four-day official visit, said the
protesters represented an insignificant portion of the population.
He told French TV network Antenne-2 that he spoke with officials of
the ruling Provisional Council for National Unity who assured him,
``All is in order.''
   ``At this time we are only a provisional council,'' Roman said.
``We do not have a real legitimacy, but these 200 persons that
entered the building of the provisional government, they represent
nothing.''
   Roman told French journalists earlier Sunday that his Eastern
European nation had reached political stability under the
leadership of Iliescu, increasingly disliked for his Communist past.
   The enraged crowd stormed the offices Sunday afternoon, shouting
for interim President Ion Iliescu to resign and accusing the
provisional government of being dominated by Communists from the
Ceausescu regime.
   The only member of government in the building apparently was
Vice Prime Minister Gelu Voican Voiculescu.
   Demonstrators seized him, punched him and dragged him onto a
balcony, where he was jeered. Soldiers hustled him to his office,
where they guarded him from hundreds of demonstrators yelling
``Voican! Voican!''
   The crowd broke into the building after soldiers hauled away
protesters who scaled the building and waved Romanian flags from a
balcony. Protesters went into a frenzy, tearing iron bars from the
carpet in front of the building.
   Protesters told the crowd one man who was hauled away had been
shot, prompting cries of ``Assassins! Murderers!''
   More than 1,000 people in front of the building cheered as
protesters smashed the windows and glass doors. Hundreds surged
inside. Infantry reinforcements arrived a short time later.
   Voiculescu told The Associated Press the demonstration caught
authorities unprepared, with not enough paratroopers on hand to
contain the crowd.
   He said, ``The only thing left to do would have been to shoot at
the people. The army's job is not to shoot at the people. Let them
run around.''
   He accused opposition parties of inciting the violence and
charged that they were using the Securitate, the hated secret
police under Ceausescu.
   Protesters shouted that the government had not disbanded the
Securitate as it had promised. ``The only solution is another
revolution!'' they yelled.
   They failed to find Iliescu, who recently moved his office to
the old Grand National Assembly building several miles away,
headquarters for the provisional ruling council.
   Rampaging demonstrators broke windows, dug through office
cabinets and hurled books by Ceausescu and Communist Party manuals
to the screaming crowd outside.
   Scores of supporters of the National Salvation Front, which took
power after the revolution, began a small counterdemonstration,
crying, ``Terrorists! Terrorists!''
   Anti-government demonstrators included young and old, students
and workers. They said they belonged to no particular political
party.
   ``What we want is democracy,'' said student Cezar Rasuceanu, 22.
   Anger has built since the National Salvation Front said it
planned to take part in May elections. The Front then gave up power
and the Council of National Unity was formed.
   Opponents have accused the Front of packing the council and
seeking a return to one-party rule.
   The demonstration started like others this past week in Victory
Square _ with about 200 people arguing with one another in the
midmorning sunlight.
   But at about 2:30 p.m. protesters seeking Iliescu smashed
windows and the doors with their hands.
   When soldiers dragged away the protesters who had scaled the
building about two hours later, demonstrators cried one had been
shot and the crowd surged toward the building, hurling iron bars,
bottles, rocks and sticks.
   An army colonel in the government building told a reporter, ``If
we had gotten an order to fire, we would have fired and finished
this off in two seconds.'' He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The demonstration was far smaller than on Jan. 28, when when
more than 15,000 anti-government demonstrators demanded that the
National Salvation Front share power with opposition parties.
   That was a factor in the creation of the provisional Council of
National Unity, which is to rule until May 20 general elections.
   The Council includes 37 political parties, ethnic minority
groups and representatives of various occupations and interest
groups.

   The United National Opposition Sunday
held the largest anti-government rally in 10 years, and its
presidential candidate promised peace in Central America if she
wins.
   Campaigning for next Sunday's general elections officially ends
Wednesday, and it was UNO's last rally.
   The broad, U.S.-backed coalition of 14 parties and one native
Indian organization _ known as UNO _ is the major rival of the
ruling Sandinista National Liberation Front.
   ``On this bright day, which announces the end of the dark night
of Sandinismo, I raise my flag of national reconciliation,''
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro told a crowd of about 60,000.
   Mrs. Chamorro repeated campaign promises to end the draft,
rebuild the economy and reduce the size of the army, the largest in
Central America.
   ``Next Sunday ... the vote of the people is going to knock down
the wall of shame, as the German people did with the Berlin wall,''
she told cheering supporters at the Plaza of the Revolution.
   She is challenging President Daniel Ortega for a six-year term,
in an election that has been called a referendum on 10 years of
Sandinista rule.
   UNO is expected to run its media campaign until Wednesday, when
the Sandinistas will hold their final rally.
   About 1.7 million Nicaraguans, nearly half of the population of
3.8 million, have registered to vote in the elections for president
and vice president, National Assembly, 144 municipal councils and
two regional councils.
   The rally drew the biggest opposition attendance yet. UNO
complained, however, that officials refused to allow in a sound
system rented in neighboring Costa Rica and that supporters coming
from provincial towns were blocked or harassed.
   Police in riot gear had been stationed throughout Managua since
Saturday night, and police jeeps with tear gas grenade-launchers
were lined up on streets.
   Public transport was almost non-existent in the capital Sunday
morning. Some people said they did not attend the rally because
they feared trouble or had no way of getting there.
   ``They (police) stopped our caravan outside Masaya,'' a town 30
minutes from Managua, said one man at the rally, who would only
give his first name, Santos. ``They kept us there for a long time,
and people were getting angry. They finally let us go, but one
truck at a time, very slowly.''
   Mrs. Chamorro's running mate, Virgilio Godoy, spoke of 200,000
people at the rally, but international observers and journalists
agreed on the estimate of 60,000.
   Mrs. Chamorro, publisher of the newspaper La Prensa, promised
that Nicaragua's soldiers would be be trained for civilian jobs and
none would be left unemployed, although the estimated
150,000-member armed forces would have to be slashed.
   ``And to my dear friends in Central America, I assure them that
with the internal peace of Nicaragua, Central America also will
have peace,'' she said.
   ``I will not allow a soldier to be made of each child,'' she
said to wild cheers, alluding to the obligatory two-year military
service for all boys age 16.
   ``Our democracy will have more teachers than soldiers, and many
more schools than barracks.''
   Mrs. Chamorro has little political experience, and is not rated
as a good speaker; Sunday's address was considered her best.
   She was chosen to challenge Ortega largely for her symbolic
value as the widow of Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, a publisher and civic
leader who was killed during the dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza
and whose memory is revered by all in Nicaragua's political
spectrum.
   Her right leg still in a cast because of a fractured knee, Mrs.
Chamorro spoke from a raised stage while sitting in her wheelchair
next to Godoy.
   In what was interpreted as a reply to Sandinista accusations
that UNO is planning violent incidents to mar the elections, Mrs.
Chamorro said: ``I urge all Nicaraguans to be calm so that next
Sunday they go to vote and then go home, so as to avoid an
incident.''
   She said the best achievement of the campaign was that ``our
country has overcome fear and has acquired a greater civic
conscience.''
   Godoy appealed to women voters, who make up 54 percent of
registered voters.
   ``In the hands of the Nicaraguan woman ... is the future of the
republic, and we know they won't leave it in this mess,'' Godoy
said.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   J.C. Trewin, doyen of London's theater critics and
author of more than 50 books about the stage, has died at the age
of 81, a hospital spokeswoman said Sunday.
   He died in the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, north London,
on Friday. The hospital spokeswoman did not give the cause of death.
   For more than half a century Trewin covered the new plays on the
London stage, becoming a respected and familiar figure at West End
premieres.
   The son of a Cornish master mariner, John Courtenay Trewin fell
in love with the theater as a child when ill health kept him from
school and he taught himself to read with the aid of the family
volume of Shakespeare's plays.
   He began his career as a journalist on the Western Independent
Plymouth in 1926 and indulged his passion in the theater on trips
to London, once recalling how in 1928 he saw Sir John Gielgud in
his first starring role in the West End.
   Trewin joined the Morning Post in London in 1932 and became one
of its theater critics two years later.
   He became known as the ``actors' critic'' because of his
understanding of the art.
   He became literary editor of the Observer newspaper and in 1943
also was named its second theater critic alongside Ivor Brown. He
held the position until 1953 and later was theater critic for
numerous publications, among them Punch, The Lady and most
recently, The Illustrated London News.
   Trewin's many books included ``Five and Eighty Hamlets,'' his
description of the best of more than 150 major performances of the
play he had witnessed in a lifetime in the theater. It was
published in 1987.
   A stage historian, he lectured on Shakespeare, was a member of
the Royal Society of Literature and was a former president of the
Shakespeare Club of Stratford upon Avon.
   Trewin is survived by his wife, the former Wendy Monk, whom he
married in 1938, and by two sons.

<TEXT>
   Britain's Prince Charles won both his
polo match and the admiration of environmentalists Sunday in an
afternoon that included a fund-raising event and an impromptu kiss
from a former subject.
   The prince's Windsor Park polo team defeated White Birch 14-13
in sudden-death overtime to retain the Prince of Wales Cup at the
Windsor Club polo grounds, about 10 miles north of Vero Beach.
   Before the match, the Prince of Wales addressed 580 guests at a
$250-a-plate luncheon to benefit the Friends of Conservation, a
group concerned with saving endangered East African animals.
   Among the nearly 3,000 spectators at the polo match were
industrialist Armand Hammer and King Constantine of Greece, who is
living in exile in the United Kingdom.
   The 40-year-old heir to the British throne didn't score in the
match, but appeared in better form than during a game Friday, the
first day of his week-long visit to the United States. The prince's
team won the cup last year near Palm Beach.
   The polo match and lunch was expected to raise more than
$200,000 for the Friends of Conservation, said event organizer
Chrissy Kiely. The prince is the royal patron of the group, which
has its U.S. offices in Oak Brook, Ill.
   At the luncheon, the prince spoke for about 10 minutes on
several conservation efforts in East Africa, including
anti-poaching measures and trade bans on ivory.
   The prince endorsed proposals to outlaw trade of ivory from
elephant tusks. He also said the conservation organization has
helped establish a camel-mounted anti-poaching patrol.
   The prince emphasized what he said was the need to rely on
native Africans' knowledge to guide conservationists.
   ``We don't have a god-given right to modernize the ancient
culture and wisdom of indigenous people,'' said the prince.
   ``It's particularly important now not to do anything with the
ancient natural wisdom when we are most likely to need it.''
   An auction after the speech included six place mats featuring
copies of watercolor landscapes by the prince, which fetched
$32,000 from Hammer.
   The sale of nine items raised $113,800, said Ms. Kiely.
   Before the luncheon, the prince viewed several wild animals
brought in from the Cincinnati Zoo, including a baboon and a
95-pound aardvark that dug up the polo field with its powerful
front claws.
   The prince, dressed in a plaid short-sleeve shirt, helped stomp
the grass back into place.
   Jim Fowler, who appears on Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom
television show, drew a bemused look from the prince as he
described how cheetahs were favored prey of the elite. ``They have
been hunted by royalty since the beginning of mankind,'' he said.
   A baboon also apparently understood the significance of the
occasion by smacking its lips.
   ``That's a sign of respect,'' said Fowler.
   As he was leaving, the prince also noticed a woman waving a
British flag and beckoned her onto the field. She rushed forward,
Union Jack and roses in hand, and gave the prince a long kiss on
the cheek.
   The woman, Anita Littler, 45, a British emigre living in Miami,
felt embarrassed by the display and left before the match, said
organizer Marc Shafir.
   The prince is scheduled to visit the Kennedy Space Center on
Monday and return to the home of friends Geoffrey and Jorie Kent,
where he has stayed since Friday under tight security.
   The prince will attend a conference on international business on
Tuesday and travel later in the week to Washington, D.C., where he
will meet with President Bush and British Embassy officials.

<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of people gathered Sunday in the
Tadjikistan capital of Dushanbe to protest living conditions and a
lack of consumer goods and medicines, Tass news agency reported.
   It said the crowd also decried further ethnic violence in the
republic, where rioting in the last week has killed at least 22
people.
   Shodi Shabdolov, a secretary of the Tadjikistan Communist Party,
blamed the violence on unresolved social problems, the party daily
Pravda reported Sunday.
   He told Pravda one source of tension was that 117,000 young
people had only seasonal jobs and an additional 70,000 were
unemployed in Dushanbe, a city of 600,000 locate 1,600 miles
southeast of Moscow.
   Shabdolov said riots had caused $12 million in damage and losses
from looting amounted to $3.3 million more.
   The violence was touched off on Feb. 10 by rumors that Armenian
refugees were arrving by the thousands and receiving scarce
apartments in the city.
   Mobs rampaged through the tree-lined streets of Dushanbe,
nestled at the foot of a high mountain range, and set fire to
buildings, broke windows and smashed public vehicles.
   Tass said Sunday the situation remained unstable despite patrols
by more than 7,000 regular police and Interior Ministry and army
troops.
   It said protesters defied an official mourning period to hold
rallies in two districts near Dushanbe and demand improved living
standadrds.
   Tass said 61 people were arrested in the previous 24 houses for
violating the state of emergency still in effect, and 44 pounds of
narcotics were seized.
   Tadjikistan's Communist rulers offered to step down Wednesday
because of the rioting, but their resignations were rejected Friday
at an emergency session of the Central Committee, the party's
policy-making body.
   In another dispatch, Tass said voters in the Central Asian
republic of Uzbekistan complained of lack of choice in elections to
the local legislature Sunday.
   It reported, ``Many voters said after voting that they struck
out all candidates only due to the fact that they had no right of
choice.''
   Under Soviet voting rules, crossing out a candidate's name
renders a ballot invalid.
   Uzbekistan has 10 million voters.
   Soviet leaders have said the goal for elections to local
legislatures in many of the Soviet Union's 15 republics over the
next six weeks was to have a choice among a range of candidates.
   The agency said the atmosphere in Uzbekistan was calm, despite
earlier rumors that ethnic violence had broken out in the city of
Samarkand Saturday.

   A man accused in the abduction-slaying of a young
preschool teacher is slated to go on trial Monday in a case linked
to a spate of deadly mail bombings in the South.
   Emmanuel Hammond, 24, of Marietta is charged with felony murder,
murder, kidnapping and armed robbery in the death of Julie Love,
27, whose 1988 disappearance sparked a search that lasted more than
a year. Prosecutors plan to seek the death penalty if he is
convicted.
   Hammond is black; Ms. Love is white. A letter claiming
responsibility for the December mail bomb slayings cited Ms. Love's
death and decried crimes by blacks against whites.
   Police allege that Hammond was the triggerman. His cousin,
William Porter, pleaded guilty to murder and other charges in the
case, and is expected to testify against him.
   Jury selection is to begin Monday in Fulton County Superior
Court.
   Defense attorney William A. Wehunt has said the enormous
publicity surrounding Ms. Love's disappearance and the discovery of
her body could make selecting an impartial jury difficult. Wehunt,
however, dropped an earlier effort to move the trial out of Fulton
County, which includes most of Atlanta.
   The search that followed Ms. Love's disappearance in July 1988
included billboards and posters all over the Atlanta area bearing
the message: ``Have You Seen Julie Love?''
   Ms. Love's body was found in August in a wooded dumping ground
in Atlanta, and Hammond was arrested that month. He is being held
at the Fulton County jail without bond.
   The case drew renewed attention after Christmas when an Atlanta
television station received the letter claiming responsibility for
the mail-bomb deaths of a federal appeals Judge Robert Vance in
Mountain Brook, Ala., and attorney Robert Robinson in Savannah.
Similar bombs were intercepted at the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Atlanta, on which Vance served, and at the Jacksonville,
Fla., office of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People.
   Two small bombs exploded Saturday in grocery stores in Roswell
about 20 miles north of Atlanta, but no one was injured and the
city Police Chief Jerry King said the latest bombings didn't appear
to be linked to the earlier ones.
   Fulton County authorities have promised heavy courtroom security
for the Hammond trial, including extra sheriff's deputies to stand
guard and daily searches by bomb-sniffing dogs.
   The trial was to have started Jan. 30, but was postponed because
mental competence hearings for the defendant weren't completed in
time. Hammond was found competent to stand trial, and Judge Ralph
Hicks set a new date.
   Porter, 20, of Union City, who pleaded guilty in November to
felony murder, rape, kidnapping and armed robbery, has yet to be
sentenced.

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dozens of Soviet Jews demonstrated in cold wind
and pouring rain on Sunday to protest their living conditions even
as President Chaim Herzog welcomed new arrivals.
   It was the first such protest since a mass Soviet Jewish
immigration began last year.
   In 1989, about 12,000 Soviet Jews came to Israel. More than
8,000 have arrived so far this year, and Israel expects up to
100,000 Soviet Jews by year's end due to more liberal Soviet
emigration policies, U.S. visa restrictions and rising
anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union.
   The protesters gathered at Jerusalem's Gilo absorption center,
the country's largest. They held signs reading, ``Until now you did
not give me anything,'' and ``New immigrant, your debt to the
Jewish Agency is eternal.''
   The quasi-governmental Jewish Agency helps handle immigration
and is responsible for Gilo, where 850 immigrants live.
   The protesters complained that ceilings and walls leaked when it
rained and that central heating was turned off.
   They said the gas heaters they were given were dangerous,
pointing to the case of an elderly Soviet woman who died last month
after a gas heater explosion at Gilo.
   The immigrants, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also
complained that families living on $400 a month had to pay $250 in
rent at Gilo.
   Jewish Agency spokesman Gad Ben-Ari said the agency decided last
week to close Gilo within a year because of housing quality
problems. He said Gilo residents would be housed in rented
apartments and public housing until a new absorption center was
built in Jerusalem.
   Herzog and a group of dancing children meanwhile greeted 110
Soviet Jews who arrived at Ben-Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv from
Budapest, Hungary.
   The children gave the immigrants roses and little Israeli flags.
But Herzog warned the newcomers not everyhting in Israel would be
as pleasant.
   Israel is settling many Soviet Jews in the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip, land it captured during the 1967 Middle East war.
Arab nations oppose such a policy and say it will destroy chances
for peace in the region.
   In Manama, Bahrain, the rulers of Bahrain and the United Arab
Emirates conferred Sunday amid signs the Arab world was delaying a
decision on convening a special summit on the issue.
   Emirates President Sheik Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan arrived
Saturday from a visit to Egypt, where he advocated holding the
summit, which was first called for by King Hussein of Jordan two
weeks ago.
   The Gulf News Agency said that after his talks Sunday with the
emir of Bahrain, Sheik Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa, the two discussed
Arab issues in talks ``characterized by frankness and
understanding.''
   In Arab diplomatic terminology, ``frank'' indicates differences
of opinion.
   Sources said the prospects of a summit and the subjects it would
tackle, were major issues in the Bahrain talks.
   The two countries are grouped with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar
and Oman in the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council alliance, which
coordinates policy on regional, Arab and international issues.
   Aside from the statements by Sheik Zayed and a statement from
Kuwait, the other alliance members have not picked up Jordan's
summit call.
   Diplomatic sources said the alliance as a whole and other
nations of the 22-member Arab League support the idea of a summit
but want it convened only after clearing up inter-Arab differences.
Foremost is the feud between Syria and Iraq.

   Two small bombs that exploded in suburban
Atlanta grocery stores didn't cause any injuries, and apparently
were unrelated to a series of bombings in the South last year that
killed two, authorities said Sunday.
   No one was hurt in either of the bombings Saturday, though one
bomb exploded while dozens of customers were still in the store, a
Cub Foods market in this suburb 20 miles north of Atlanta.
   Both explosions followed telephoned threats to the stores.
Similar calls to two other supermarkets prompted evacuations, but
no bombs were found.
   ``The fuse train is all that detonated, so the effect of the
bombs was really only that of a firecracker,'' FBI spokesman Pat
Johnson said of the Cub Foods bomb. ``It didn't do much damage
except to its packaging.''
   Federal agents said Sunday they were still trying to determine
the type of explosive used. They refused to comment on a possible
motive or divulge other details of the investigation by local
authorities and agents of the FBI and federal bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms.
   Roswell's police chief, Jerry King, said the incidents didn't
seem to be linked to unsolved mail bombings that killed a federal
judge in Alabama and a lawyer in Savannah in December.
   At Cub Foods, witnesses said about 100 customers remained in the
store when the bomb detonated in the paper products section.
   ``We got all the store personnel running registers and bagging
to hurry up and get them out,'' said Royce Pugh, Cub Foods'
assistant customer services manager, who took the warning call.
   ``I heard a boom and ran to look,'' said shopper Chuck Culpepper
of Roswell. ``All I saw was a bunch of toilet paper in the aisle
and debris from where the bomb shot. It sounded like a bunch of
cherry bombs going off.''
   At the Kroger, perishables manager Rhonda Bartlett said managers
oversaw a quick evacuation. Groceries were left piled on checkout
counters and in baskets, and the explosion came as shoppers and
employees stood outside.
   ``We did not hear it, not at all,'' she said. ``We were just
informed by the police that (the explosion) happened.''
   Federal explosives and FBI agents and four explosives-sniffing
dogs from the Atlanta police department searched all four stores.
   ``To my knowledge, nothing was found in the other two stores.
They were both checked and both found to be clear,'' said ATF
spokesman Tom Stokes.
   Stokes said that investigators were trying to identify the type
of explosives used. He said there were no suspects so far.
   Agents took a package and pieces of cardboard, apparently
covered with gunpowder residue, from the Kroger.

<HEAD>Iranian Students Support Death Sentence Against Author Rushdie</HEAD>

   Iranian media reports said thousands of
students demonstrated Sunday to support the year-old death sentence
against British author Salman Rushdie and also demanded that Briton
Roger Cooper be executed.
   Cooper, a 53-year-old British businessman, has been held in
prison on spying charges in Iran since Dec. 7, 1985. He lived in
Iran for 20 years prior to his arrest.
   In London, the British Foreign Office said it ``deeply
deplored'' the call for his execution.
   The late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, architect of Iran's
Islamic revolution, issued a religious edict on Feb. 14, 1989,
condemning Rushdie to death for what Khomeini said was the author's
defaming of Islam in his novel ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, IRNA, said
students issued a communique at the end of a march from Tehran
University to the former British Embassy, calling for curbing trade
relations with Britain and condemning Britain's recent deportation
of nine Iranians.
   IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, said the statement demanded
deportation of British journalists from Iran, although none is
known to be stationed there, and that Cooper be put to death.
   Britain expelled the nine Iranians on Feb. 1 for what it said
were national security reasons. It did not elaborate, but similar
previous expulsions were linked to the Rushdie death decree.
   Rushdie, 42, has been in hiding in Britain under protective
guard since Khomeini called for his head.
   Several Iranian leaders set a bounty of $5.2 million.
   Iranian news reports said demonstrators burned British and
American flags while chanting, ``By the ruling of Khomeini, Salman
Rushdie must be killed!'' ``Death to Britain!'' and ``Death to
America!''
   Rushdie, born in India of Moslem parents, is a British citizen.
Iran cut ties with Britain last year when it supported Rushdie's
right to publish ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Sunday's reports said Moslem cleric Mohammad Ali Ansari, in
charge of the institute publishing Khomeini's works, told the
rally: ``Moslems are obliged to carry out the edict whatever the
circumstances.''
   Tehran radio quoted Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, head of the
judiciary, as saying on Sunday that Moslems who possess the means
to kill Rushdie but do not are sinners in the eyes of God.
   The broadcast quoted Yazdi as saying Khomeini's ruling that
Rushdie be killed was ``unchangeable and irrevocable.''

   Snow fell from Colorado to California on Sunday, while heavy
rain forced dozens of families from their homes in Alabama.
   A winter storm warning was in effect until Monday for the
southern mountains of Colorado. Snow fell elsewhere in Colorado and
in parts of Utah, Nevada, Arizona and in California's Sierra Nevada
range.
   Four inches of snow fell overnight near Las Vegas.
   Already soaked northwest Georgia could be hit by 2 to 3 inches
more rain, the National Weather Service said.
   Five people have been killed in Alabama and Georgia since
flooding started late last week.
   In northern Alabama, flooding along the Coosa, Black Warrior and
Tallapoosa rivers forced dozens of families to evacuate.
   Rain also fell in South Carolina, Mississippi, southwest
Tennessee, southwest Arkansas, Louisiana and eastern Texas.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 pm EST ranged from 2 degrees
in Warroad, Minn., to 86 degrees in Fort Myers, Fla.
   Temperatures reched record lows for the date in Alameda, Calif.,
38 degrees, and Oakland, Calif., 37 degrees.
   The cold spot in the Lower 48 states was Massena, N.Y., with a
morning low 19 degrees below zero.

<HEAD>Thirteen-Year-old Sent to Prison for 38 Years After Lying About
Age</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 13-year-old Vietnamese immigrant who lied about
his age was tried as an adult and sentenced to 38 years in prison
four years ago for an armed robbery, a newspaper reported Sunday.
   Authorities are re-examining the case of Luan Van Hoang, who
said he told police his name was Michael Nguyen and that he was 17
to avoid being returned to a California home for juvenile
offenders, The Dallas Morning News said.
   The boy, who'd lived in the United States for four years and had
limited knowledge of the legal system when arrested, said he
believed Vietnamese friends who told him that lying about his age
would result in probation.
   Dallas County authorities said they accepted Luan's story and
tried him as an adult.
   But after reviewing records obtained by the Morning News that
show Luan was a juvenile, District Attorney John Vance on Friday
took steps to return the boy to Dallas to determine whether he
should remain in prison.
   ``We're happy to know this,'' Vance said. ``If he is in fact a
juvenile, he has no business being in our prison as an adult.''
   Luan, now 17, is at the maximum-security Wynne prison in
Huntsville with men, many of them twice his age, serving time for
murder and other violent crimes.
   He said some of the men have tried to attack him sexually.
   ``I looked young,'' Luan said. ``If you are weak, they will try.
They did try. They see I am different. I was scared. They tried to
hurt me. I tried to protect myself.''
   Texas prisons are limited to adult convicts and juvenile
convicts 15 and older who are certified to stand trial as adults.
Offenders under 15 are supposed to be tried in juvenile courts and,
if found delinquent, sent to Texas Youth Commission centers.
   Luan's father, Tien Van Hoang, wrote state District Judge Jack
Hampton, who presided over Luan's trial, that his son was underage.
   ``Nobody answer,'' said the Moreno Valley, Calif., man. ``Nobody
write to me anything.''
   Texas Department of Corrections officials know Luan only as
Michael Nguyen. Department spokesman Charles Brown said Nguyen's
file shows a birth date of Jan. 8, 1968, and identifies his father
as Tien Van Hoang.
   ``There are errors all the time,'' Brown said. ``If there's an
error, we're not opposed to correcting it. I don't think it's our
error, though.''
   Neither the boy nor his family has a copy of his birth
certificate.
   ``When I escape from Vietnam by boat, everything was lost,''
said Tien, who was in the South Vietnamese Army and was imprisoned
by the communists after the fall of Saigon in 1975.
   He escaped from prison. In 1982, he and his family sailed to the
United States.
   According to U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service
documents, Luan was born on Oct. 10, 1972, in South Vietnam.
California public school records give the same date.
   ``It would appear to me ... that this person has been illegally
sentenced and should be released if you can prove his age,'' said
Ron Jackson, executive director of the Texas Youth Commission.
   Juvenile court records are confidential, but Luan said he was
sent to a California halfway house for boys after arrests for
joyriding and auto theft.
   He said he fled after serving eight months of a nine-month
sentence. He hitched a ride to Texas, and joined a band of
Vietnamese youths who police said were involved in robbing Asian
refugees in the Dallas area.
   Luan admitted being present during the robbery of a man at
gunpoint on Jan. 29, 1986.
   Police say they eventually linked Luan to several robberies in
the area. Before his trial, Dallas County Assistant District
Attorney Lana McDaniel offered Luan a plea bargain, but he refused.
He was convicted, and sentenced to 38 years.
   Luan's girlfriend testified at the trial that the youth was 17.
Ms. McDaniel said she relied upon the police determination of
Luan's age.
   ``What am I supposed to do?'' she said. ``I can't investigate
(the age of) every kid who tells us he's 17. He needs to learn not
to lie when his life is on the line.''

   East German homosexuals on Sunday formed
their own interest group to fight for equal rights, including to
adopt children and have partnerships with the legal force of
marriage, news reports said.
   The Gay Association in East Germany, with headquarters in
Leipzig, also will fight for reparations for persecution of
homosexuals during the Nazi dictatorship, the official news agency
ADN said.
   The Nazis persecuted homosexuals and put them in concentration
camps along with Jews, communists, Gypsies and other groups.
   The Jews, who lost the most people in the camps, have received
billions of dollars in reparations from the West German government.
   ADN did not say how many members the new group had.

<HEAD>Salvadoran Coffee Ship Turned Away From Fourth Port</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ship carrying coffee from El
Salvador was turned away from a fourth port Sunday because of
protests spurred by the killing of six priests in that country.
   Dockworkers refused to unload 34 tons of coffee from the
freighter Ciudad de Buenaventura, honoring a picket line of about
100 proponents of a boycott of Salvadoran coffee.
   Over ten days, the ship's cargo has been turned away from San
Francisco; Vancouver, British Columbia; Seattle, and now the Port
of Long Beach, 25 miles south of downtown Los Angeles.
   ``The fact that the ship was unsuccessful in landing on the West
Coast sends a strong message to all shippers that they're going to
have real trouble here,'' said Denise Bergez, spokeswoman for
Neighbor to Neighbor, an activist group. ``It's going to cost them
a lot of money to try to bring coffee to the West Coast.''
   The San Francisco-based organization called for the boycott to
protest U.S. support for the Salvadoran government, the death
squads it accuses the government of supporting and the killings
there of six Jesuit priests. Government troops have been implicated
in the slayings.
   Coffee is one of El Salvador's principal exports, with about 60
percent of the harvest, worth $400 million, shipped to the United
States each year.
   Union dock workers have announced their support for the boycott
and some U.S. coffee companies agreed to stop shipping coffee to
the West Coast.
   ``It's inconvenient for us, of course,'' Felipe Torres, manager
of the company that owns the Ciudad de Buenaventura, told the Los
Angeles Times in a report published Saturday.
   Speaking from his offices in Bogota, Colombia, Torres calculated
the company's losses could reach $15,000 because of the protests.
   Demonstrators Sunday carried signs that said ``Boycott
Salvadoran Death-Squad Coffee'' and chanting, ``Salvadoran coffee,
send it back, don't unload one bloody sack.''
   Longshoremen unloaded the ship's watermelons and other cargo,
but refused to touch the Salvadoran coffee.
   The ship's next destination wasn't known.

<TEXT>
   Ignoring pressure by labor, big
business and political groups, the government reaffirmed its
commitment to combat hyperinflation and recession by balancing the
budget and selling public companies.
   ``There will be no change in the direction of the economic
plan,'' Economy Minister Antonio Gonzalez said Sunday at a news
conference broadcast nationwide after a two-hour Cabinet meeting
chaired by President Carlos Menem.
   The meeting followed the slide of Argentina's currency by 28
percent against the U.S. dollar last week, drastic price mark-ups
in stores and strikes by public workers that disrupted banks,
federal courtrooms and oil fields.
   The Bankworkers Association vows to shut all five national
banks, including the Central Bank, on Monday to protest plans to
close 14 branches of the National Mortgage Bank and cut 1,200 jobs.
   University professors whose salaries were eroded by 79 percent
inflation in January say they won't work beginning Monday until
they get a pay hike the government says it cannot afford. That
boycott could stall the start of classes next month.
   Gonzalez seemed to meet such opposition head on. The
money-losing National Mortgage Bank will be restructured, he said,
notwithstanding the opposition of employees who fear cuts in wages
and benefits.
   Marginal fields operated by the state oil company YPF will be
leased to foreign companies, Gonzalez said, a move that might yield
$500 million in investment.
   Import tariffs will be lowered for selected food and
pharmaceutical products whose prices have skyrocketed as local
businessmen hiked prices with the dollar instead of inflation or
actual costs, he said.
   Federal subsidies to provinces and private companies, such as
tax benefits related to industrial development, will be suspended,
he said, and public companies like the railroad will have to
operate on the revenue they collect.
   The Menem government has been beset by economic woes since he
took office last July. Inflation that month was 197 percent. By the
end of the year, the gross domestic product had fallen by nearly 8
percent, and an estimated one of every five workers was under- or
unemployed.
   Although endorsed by organized unions during the campaign, Menem
implemented anti-labor policies of public service rate hikes, price
increases ahead of wages, budget austerity. He freed controls on
wages, prices and foreign exchange, and lowered import tariffs.
   The moves were designed to narrow the fiscal deficit that
analysts put at a minimum 10 percent of the gross national product
of approximately $70 billion.
   The 59-year-old attorney and former provincial governor said he
had no choice. Foreign banks won't lend to Argentina, nor will
Argentines except at extremely high rates of interest. And printing
money converted a decade-long problem with inflation into
hyperinflation that soared by 8,164 percent during the past 12
months.
   Policies of austerity have brought Menem criticism from leftist
parties who campaigned for him, and from a growing number of
dissidents within his own Peronist Party who believe the state
should maintain its key role in the economy.
   The plan ``lacks confidence, credibility and efficiency,'' a
leader of the opposition Civic Radical Union, Leopoldo Moreau, said
Saturday.

   Nearly 200 people were evacuated from a TWA
jetliner Sunday when the plane's cabin filled with thick, acrid
smoke, authorities said.
   Three passengers suffered minor ankle injuries leaving the plane
by its emergency escape chutes, said Fire Department spokesman Pat
Marek.
   One of the passengers was taken to Daniel Freeman Memorial
Hospital. The other two and a crew member who suffered smoke
inhalation were treated at the scene, Marek said.
   The Lockheed L-1011, with 180 passengers and 12 crew members
aboard, was being prepared for takeoff for John F. Kennedy Airport
in New York when smoke poured into the cabin shortly before 4:30
p.m., prompting early reports that the craft was on fire, Marek
said.
   ``Further investigation revealed there was no fire,'' he added.
Workers found a broken fuel line, said Marek, who didn't know
exactly what generated the smoke.

   A medium-sized earthquake and a
smaller aftershock struck a remote area 20 miles southeast of this
desert resort on Sunday, and no damage or injuries were reported.
   The first temblor struck at 7:52 a.m. and measured 4.2 on the
Richter scale of ground motion, and was followed two minutes later
by the aftershock measuring 3.1, said Hall Daily, a spokesman for
the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.
   The Palm Springs Police Department received inquiries about the
quake and aftershock, but no reports of trouble, said police
assistant Lynette Detz, who said the department ``shook a little
bit'' from the first quake.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 can cause moderate damage.
   Palm Springs is 110 miles east of Los Angeles.

   The dogs, described by one witness as looking like huskies, were

   Neighbor Mary Patuano said she started screaming when she saw
the attack and another neighbor hit the animals with a broom until
they ran off.
   ``Adam was on his stomach with one dog tearing at his shoulder
like a shark. The other dog was pulling him in the other direction

<TEXT>
   President Vaclav Havel said Sunday that the German
desire to unite the two Germanys can help speed creation of a
united Europe.
   But his foreign minister, Jiri Dienstbier, chastised the
Christian Democratic party of West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
for failing to state clearly that the present border between
Germany and Poland will remain intact.
   Havel, the playwright-president who came to power in the surge
of reforms that coursed over Eastern Europe, told a news conference
that German unification must develop against the backdrop of a new
Europe.
   ``I regard the desire of the Germans for unification not as an
impediment, but as a driving force that can speed the development
of the all-European home,'' he said.
   The president, accompanied by a team of senior ministers, is in
Canada for a two-day visit. He is seeking assistance from Canada,
mainly in the form of expertise to rebuild Czechoslovakia's economy
and democratic institutions. He is also meeting with
Czechoslovak-Canadians in Ottawa and Toronto.
   ``As we embark upon democracy, we have a lot to learn from other
countries,'' Havel said.
   Czechoslovakia will hold its first free elections in 42 years in
June.
   Havel was welcomed by Governor General Ray Hnatyshyn at Canadian
Forces Base Uplands.
   He also met Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, leaders of federal
opposition parties and former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau.
   Havel will travel to Washington Tuesday to meet President Bush
and address a joint session of Congress.
   In his remarks, Dienstbier said Poland's interests must be
protected during German unification. Czechoslovakia and Poland
share borders with what is now East Germany, and Poland has
insisted that its interests be taken into account.
   Dienstbier said talks between the Germanys and the four World
War II Allied powers _ the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain
and France _ are a ``first step'' toward German unification. The
talks were arranged last week in Ottawa during the Open Skies
conference of the NATO and Warsaw Pact military alliances.
   ``Polish interests must be safeguarded. The western border of
Poland is the only border about which no conclusive statement has
been made on the German side,'' Dienstbier said.
   Kohl says any official position on the border issue should be
taken up by a future parliament elected by a united Germany.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher has said the
present borders will remain intact.

<TEXT>
   President Bush's commission on
aviation security and terrorism laid a wreath of red, white and
blue flowers Sunday in memory of the victims of the Pan Am Flight
103 bombing.
   Commission Chairman Ann McLaughlin later told a news conference
the likelihood of such a bombing occurring again was reduced by
advances made in security following the disaster Dec. 21, 1988.
   The seven commissioners laid the wreath in an area of this small
Scottish town where debris from the Boeing 747 destroyed municipal
housing.
   They then went to the wind-swept Dryfesdale cemetery, where a
permanent marble memorial has been dedicated to the 270 people
killed when the airplane exploded _ all 259 on the plane and 11 on
the ground.
   Mrs. McLaughlin placed the wreath next to a lacrosse stick left
by a visiting team from Syracuse University. Many students enrolled
in the university's study abroad program were among those killed.
   She told reporters later, ``I would suggest the terrorists are
not winning, if security is good and getting better. There are
still problems ... but the probablity of attack has been reduced
since Lockerbie because of technical advances and human resource.
   ``Nothing spoke so loudly as the silence of some of the Pan Am
impact sites here. This makes us ever more determined that the
people responsible for murdering men, women and children at 31,000
feet above this community are brought to justice.''
   During their four-day stay, commission members met with
Transport Security Cecil Parkinson and security officials at
London's Heathrow Airport.
   Flight 103 originated in Frankfurt, but passengers and baggage
were transferred to a larger plane at Heathrow for the New
York-bound flight.
   The commission also visited West Germany and France to consult
airline, government and security officials.
   It will report in May to Bush on American policy on the
terrorist threat to civil aircraft and make safety recommendations.

<TEXT>
   An Army deserter who returned to the
United States last month after nearly 30 years in East Germany was
welcomed back at an open house Sunday.
   A motel in this city about five miles east of Omaha, Neb.,
played host to Arnold Kephart, 53, and some 75 relatives and
friends, including a man from his old Army unit, the 503rd
Transportation Company.
   ``This isn't a case involving a hero or military battles,'' said
Kephart's attorney, James Martin Davis. ``Like the prodigal son
who's been away for all these years, he is being welcomed back by
his family and by his community.''
   Kephart says he tried unsuccessfully to escape from East
Germany, but didn't get out until after the Berlin Wall came down
last year.
   Military police arrested him when he arrived in Omaha on Jan. 30
with his 12-year-old son, Frankie, shocking relatives who'd come to
the airport to welcome him home. A week later, he was granted an
other-than-honorable discharge.
   In 1960, Pvt. Kephart fled his Army unit in West Germany for
East Germany because he was afraid he would be punished for
crashing an Army truck.
   His letters didn't reach his family until about a year after he
deserted, and letters that reached home were censored.
   Some relatives didn't believe Kephart was still alive, said a
niece, Janice Dow of Logan, who was 10 months old when he
disappeared. ``It always seemed like a big mystery to me,'' she
said during the open house at the Frontier Motor Lodge.
   Kephart, who worked as a truck driver in the small southern city
of Smalkalden, said Sunday he didn't want to run East Germany down.
``They are 40 to 50 years behind the times,'' he said.
   Clayton Schaner of Council Bluffs, who served in Kephart's
company overseas, brought pictures of the old unit to the open
house. He and Kephart discussed people and places they'd known.
   ``Remember we had the fence there and the Army depot, and people
used to climb under the fence and sneak out?'' Schaner said.
   ``Ja, ja,'' Kephart replied in a German accent between drags on
a cigarette.
   Kephart said his plans include exploring places he grew up in
around Missouri, then getting a job and settling down in Council
Bluffs for at least a year or two.
   Davis said there may be a television movie based on Kephart's
life. Two production companies have made offers, and a third offer
is expected, the attorney said.
   Kephart said many things have changed in the United States,
shaking his head with wonder as he talked about the interstate
highway system and the many types of cars on the road.
   Kephart, who is divorced, said his son will learn English and go
to school.
   ``It will be hard for him,'' he said.

   Political folklore has it that on Election Day in
the Windy City, the dead miraculously cast ballots and party

   Michael Hamblet, chairman of the Chicago Board of Election

appear to be about as honest as elections elsewhere.
   ``We always hear horror stories about ghost votes and people
casting multiple ballots,'' Hamblet said. ``It is my belief that
present-day Chicago elections are probably as clean or cleaner than
any other jurisdiction.''
   Hamblet says he remembers reading allegations by the U.S
attorney in Chicago that about 100,000 people voted illegally in
1983, when Harold Washington was elected mayor.
   ``If that was true, it would be pretty startling,'' Hamblet
said. ``I always beleived the figure was grossly inflated.''
   To find out how many people were casting multiple ballots and
the number of dead holding on to their voter registration cards,
Hamblet authorized elections board investigators to do a computer
study of voter registrations in the 1989 mayoral election. That
election was won by Richard M. Daley, son of late Mayor Richard J.
Daley.
   Hamblet said the board's computer, matching names, Social
Security numbers and birth dates of voters, determined that 28,785
people were registered more than once _ meaning there could have
been that many repeat voters.
   But when board personnel conducted a follow-up investigation to
determine how many of those with duplicate registrations actually
voted more than once, they could find only one repeat voter,
Hamblet said.
   Board officials withheld the name of the repeat voter because
they contended the voter cast the second ballot inadvertently.
   However, Chicago political consultant Don Rose says duplicate
voting isn't the primary issue in Chicago elections.
   Assistance voting, where party precinct captains help point out
selections for voters, should be of greater concern of the election
board, Rose said. He also urged the board to make a concerted
effort to purge the voter rolls of outdated names.
   ``What they (the board) does is conduct purges selectively,''
Rose said. ``The majority of purges take place in the minority
community, to some extent with good reason because mobility there
is higher. But also because it is easier.''
   Hamblet defended the board.
   ``I don't think there is evidence that we aren't being
impartial,'' he said. ``From our standpoint we are doing everything
we can to make it a fair and impartial purge.''
   Hamblet said that through a variety of means of checking, the
board usually eliminates about 50,000 to 100,000 people from the
voter rolls each election.
   Despite his reservations about the board's efforts, Rose agrees
with Hamblet that Chicago's elections are more honest than in the
past.

   Archaeologists unearthed a small marble
statue buried in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 A.D., the
first such find in 13 years, newspapers reported Sunday.
   The statue, which depicts a baby boy riding a dolphin, was found
Saturday in the House of the Casti Amanti, near the center of the
abandoned city, Il Mattino of Naples and other papers reprted.
   Archaeologists said the statue was apparently to be used to
decorate a fountain in the house, but that Vesuvius erupted before
workers had a chance to set it in place. Experts said traces of
paint coloring the hair blond and eyebrows black made the find even
more valuable.
   They believe the House of Casti Amanti was owned by a baker, who
lived on one side and kept a shop on the other.
   The last statue to be found in Pompeii was a bronze dug up in
1977.

<HEAD>Thatcher Urges West Maintain Strong Defenses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE SHEPHERD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Sunday the
West needs to maintain strong military defenses, despite broad
Soviet troop cuts, because ``you never know where a new threat
might come from.''
   In a speech to the Board of Deputies of British Jews, she also
said any German unification agreement must respect existing
European borders.
   Mrs. Thatcher said, ``Hopefully there will be an opportunity to
make some reductions in our forces as part of balanced reductions
by both NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
   ``But we shall not do anything which will put our defense and
our security at risk, nor weaken our capability to undertake
out-of-area tasks, and that means that we shall continue to need
our independent nuclear deterrent as well as strong and
well-equipped conventional forces.''
   The United States and Soviet Union agreed this month to deep
troop cuts in Central Europe, and Poland, Hungary and
Czechoslovakia are negotiating troop cuts with Moscow.
   But Mrs. Thatcher said the Soviet Union will still have ``vast
military capabilities,'' and that the West should not become
complacent and undermine or dismantle institutions such as NATO.
   ``If we had had something equivalent to NATO in the 1930s, we
should never have had a Second World War. We shall always have to
keep adequate defenses because you never know where a new threat
might come from,'' she said.
   ``One has to bear in mind that 12 countries outside NATO and the
Warsaw Pact already have ballistic missiles, and many more ...
could be in a position to acquire nuclear weapons by the end of the
century.''
   She said any agreement on German unification must respect
existing borders in Europe and the rights of the four Allied
powers, Britain, France, the United States and the Soviet Union.
   She said she hoped a united Germany would remain part of NATO,
with U.S. troops stationed there, ``with some special arrangements
for East Germany to meet the Soviet Union's security concerns.
Indeed, it would be quite reasonable for some Soviet troops to
remain there at least for a transitional period.''
   The Soviet Union says it would seek troop reductions in a
unified Germany as well as withdrawal from the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization.
   Mrs. Thatcher said Britain support's Poland's wish to have its
western border with Germany guaranteed by a treaty. No peace treaty
was signed at the end of World War II, so Poland has no formal
guarantees of its border.
   Poland, which was overrun by Nazi Germany, wants a role in
planned talks among the four Allies and East and West Germany so it
can protect its borders.
   Mrs. Thatcher also pledged to continue campaigning for Jews
wrongly imprisoned in the Soviet Union, but warned it would be
unjust if Israel settled Soviet emigrants in the occupied
territories.
   She renewed her appeal to Israel to talk to Palestinians about
elections in the occupied territories.

<HEAD>Music Obscenity Conviction Returns To Court Monday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALEXANDER CITY, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The obscenity conviction of a record
store owner involving a rap music recording and believed to be the
first of its kind in the nation is the subject of a new trial
opening Monday.
   Tommy Hammond, who was convicted in 1988 of violating this
city's obscenity ordinance by selling the rap group 2 Live Crew's
``Move Somethin,''' will be represented by the Civil Liberties
Union of Alabama at his Tallapoosa County Circuit Court trial.
   ``Should this conviction stand, it will open the doors for
similar prosecutions around the state,'' the organization said in a
statement last week.
   Hammond's conviction marked the first time music was found to be
legally obscene in the United States, the American Civil Liberties
Union and music industry officials have said.
   He was arrested after a woman complained to police about her son
obtaining a copy of the ``Move Somethin''' cassette at Hammond's
record shop in this city of about 14,000 people about 40 miles
northeast of Montgomery.
   Hammond was convicted in municipal court and fined $500.
   Under Alabama law, any conviction before a Municipal Court judge
must receive a jury trial at the circuit court level before it can
be appealed.
   Hammond's Montgomery attorneys, Robert Segall and Elizabeth
Johnson, contend he is a victim of discriminatory prosecution.
   Segall said another Alexander City record store sold the same
recording after Hammond did, but wasn't prosecuted.
   Police told the judge the other record store owner wasn't
arrested because he refused to sell the recording to a police
informant.
   Ms. Johnson said Sunday night that the case also raises the
issue of free speech, which is guaranteed under the First Amendment
of the U.S. Constitution.
   ``The question is whether or not he can sell the tapes to an
adult,'' she said. ``Children do not enter into this case at all.''
   An attorney for the city, Daniel Brown, said last year that 2
Live Crew violated Alexander City's obscenity laws because the
group's lyrics provide detailed descriptions of perverse sexual
acts and sadomasochism.
   Ms. Johnson disagreed at the time, saying ``profanity and
offensive music are not what obscenity is all about. You may be
offended by it, but that doesn't make it obscene.''
   The group records under the Miami-based Luke Skywalker label,
which paid half of Hammond's legal fees in the first round of the
legal fight.
   Label spokeswoman Debbie Bennett has said the recording's
sexually explicit language is intended as humor and is far from
being obscene.

<TEXT>
   Two men wanted in the slaying of a
Florida sheriff's deputy and the wounding of another during a
robbery were arrested at a toll plaza Sunday afternoon, Maryland
State Police said.
   Lancelot Urisley Armstrong, 26, of Lauderhill, Fla., and Wayne
Allen Coleman, 20, of Miami, surrendered peacefully after state
police cars converged on them at the toll booth on Interstate 95
north of Baltimore, said Sgt. Bruce Speck.
   Armstrong and Coleman were charged as fugitives and held pending
bond review before a District Court commissioner, according to
authorities.
   Armstrong and Coleman were being sought in connection with the
killing of Broward County, Fla., Deputy John Greeney III. He and
his partner were shot as they responded to a silent holdup alarm at
a Church's Fried Chicken outlet in Fort Lauderdale on Saturday.
   When the deputies pulled into the restaurant parking lot, ``two
armed men came out and opened fire on them,'' said sheriff's
spokesman George Crolius. ``One of them had a semiautomatic weapon,
we believe.''
   Greeney, 47, had been a deputy for 3{ years, after a career as a
military police officer, said sheriff's spokesman Al Gordon.
   Deputy Robert Sallustio, 25, hit in the back, arm and leg, was
listed in fair and stable condition at Broward General Medical
Center, Gordon said.
   No customers were in the restaurant, but one and possibly two
employees were inside.

   An small earthquake shook a rural area
early Sunday, and there were no reports of damage.
   The tremor registered 2.3 on the Richter scale of ground motion,
said Joyce Bagwell, director of the Earthquake Education Center at
Baptist College at Charleston.
   ``About 7:24 a.m. some Summerville residents were awakened by a
slight explosive sound and a rumbling. I felt it myself,'' Ms.
Bagwell said. ``Some people at the college said it felt like a
train rumbling through just slightly.''
   It was felt in an area between Summerville and Middleton Place,
some 20 miles north of Charleston, she said.
   Since the beginning of the year, four earthquakes have shaken
lower South Carolina, Mrs. Bagwell said. Only two were strong
enough to be felt, she said.
   Earthquakes in the Summerville and North Charleston areas aren't
uncommon, she said.
   A quake of magnitude 3.5 _ more than 10 times the strength of
the Carolina temblor _ is considered capable of causing slight
damage in the immediate area.

<TEXT>
   One day the scent wafting through End-All
Products Co. might be a cross between baby powder and citrus.
   On another day, the tiny western Maryland factory might smell
like bubble gum, the scent of a deodorizer sold to freshen the
holding tanks of portable toilets from coast to coast.
   ``We have the mission of making things smell nice,'' company
president Phil Gamerman said as he waved vials of portable toilet
fragrances under his nose.
   ``If it's freshly cleaned and serviced, the toilet is likely to
smell like bubble gum or cherries,'' he said. ``Why? It's a total
mystery to me. It's the tradition in that industry. They work.
They're just nice, strong scents that cover.''
   Ron Gillette, managing editor of the monthly magazine Sanitary
Maintenance, said the more than $12 billion sanitary supply
distribution and wholesale industry is expanding steadily.
   ``The scents themselves have caught up with the public's desire.
It's no longer the killer pine or ammonia smell. Now, we have have
orange, cherry _ they don't overpower us,'' he said.
   In addition to the liquid deodorizing products, End-All makes
half-dollar-sized discs of heavy blotter paper treated with potent
drops of various fragrances.
   Diaper services put the non-toxic sachets in bundles of clean
diapers. Businesses buy them for laundry rooms, toilets and
laboratory incubators where smelly cultures grow. Besides the
cherry, bubblegum and citrus-baby powder scents, the sachets are
made to smell like lemons or candy cinammon hearts.
   The company is trying to market the pleasant-smelling discs to
janitorial services that clean offices. They could be used in broom
closets, trash cans, offices, bathrooms or wherever the air is
musty or stale.
   ``Also, with a slight change in packaging, we're going to put
sticky patches on the backs so you can slap them under a sink or
anywhere,'' Gamerman said.
   In late 1985, Gamerman, a 45-year-old Baltimore native trained
in psychotherapy, took over part of the deodorizer business from
his former partner, who peddles pet products and deodorizers for
pets.
   In his first full year of business, End-All posted $35,000 in
sales. Last year, sales totaled $233,000.
   ``There's not a whole lot of financial reward at this point,''
Gamerman said, adding that his goal is to pass $1 million in annual
sales within two years. ``We're operating profitably, but we are
putting everything back into the business as fast as we make it.''
   Besides Gamerman, End-All employs seven others _ three full-time
and two part-time production workers, a salesman and Teresa Smith,
office manager.
   ``The first week I went home from work with headaches. My
husband would say `You smell like ... I don't know what you smell
like,''' Smith said. ``Now, I don't even notice it.''
   Winter is a slow time for End-All.
   ``Things don't smell so much in the wintertime,'' Gamerman said.
``We really work hard on the telephone in Florida and southern
California.''
   To offset the slowdown, Gamerman developed the deodorizing discs
with the sticky backs and is working on a line of janitorial
cleaning supplies for nationwide distribution.
   ``I look for niche markets,'' he said. ``I look for unique
twists on a product.''
   He also is working on a new fragrance spray or sachet that could
be put inside used luxury cars at car dealerships.
   ``We're not talking about a cheap, industrial-type fragrance.
We're talking about a fine fragrance,'' he said. ``This is going to
make them smell like Ferraris or Rolls-Royces.''

   Japan's conservative governing party held on to its
34-year-old majority in Parliament's powerful lower house Sunday,
but scandals and an unpopular tax may have cost it nearly three
dozen seats in the closely watched election.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu called the preliminary results ``a
form of purification'' for his troubled Liberal Democratic Party.
   The secretary-general of the main opposition Socialist Party,
Tsuruo Yamaguchi, disagreed: ``Simply being elected does not mean
one is absolved.'' The Socialists made strong gains.
   The political outlook was clouded because the opposition holds a
majority in Parliament's upper house, making it difficult to pass
major legislation or deal with trade problems with the United
States.
   The Liberal Democrats needed at least 257 seats to maintain
control of the 512-seat lower house, which chooses the prime
minister and can pass a budget without assent of the upper house.
   With 80 percent of the 66 million ballots counted late Sunday,
election officials declared the Liberal Democrats had won 240
seats, compared with 114 for the Socialists. The Clean Government
Party had 31 seats, the Communist Party 13, the Democratic
Socialist Party 12, the United Social Democratic Party three, and
18 independents were elected.
   Votes for the remaining 81 seats were to be counted Monday.
   Kyodo News Service predicted 271 seats for the Liberal
Democrats, enough to control all standing committees in the house
but far short of the 295 they held after the last election in June
1986.
   ``I think we have defended our majority at least,'' said Ichiro
Ozawa, secretary-general of the party, while conceding the loss of
rural seats where farmers reacted angrily to increased imports of
agricultural products.
   About 73 percent of the 90.5 million eligible voters _ a high
turnout _ cast ballots. The election was seen as a test of whether
the Liberal Democrats had recovered from a disastrous year of
scandals and implementation of an unpopular 3 percent sales tax.
   Two conservative prime ministers resigned in quick succession
last year amid sex and money scandals, and the Socialists' popular
chairwoman, Takako Doi, 61, seemed to have a chance to tilt Japan
to the left.
   But the conservative Japanese voters rejected that bold step,
though the Socialists enhanced their standing as the No. 1
opposition party. They had 83 seats in the outgoing house.
   Ms. Doi refused to concede defeat or comment in detail before
the final count. ``I'd like to wait until the results are in, in
hope of good news,'' she said.
   Yamaguchi, the Socialist secretary-general, attributed the
Liberal Democrats' success to ``support from big business and large
contributions from corporations.''
   At least a dozen Liberal Democrats won re-election despite being
linked to last year's so-called Recruit scandal, in which
influential politicians profited from cut-rate stock offered by the
Recruit Co. conglomerate in return for political favors.
   Kaifu, 59, called the results a ``significant verdict of the
people.''
   ``It is a form of purification,'' he said.
   Koshiro Ishida, chairman of the Komeito (Clean Government
Party), denounced the results, saying, ``There has been no
`purification.' I'd like to know how the Liberal Democrats plan to
take responsibility (for corrupt politics).''
   The post-election period will be crammed with foreign policy
issues as well as political work to deal with the legislative
roadblocks facing the government.
   U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is arriving Tuesday to ask
Japan to increase its payments supporting the 50,000 U.S. troops
based here. On Thursday, U.S.-Japan negotiations resume to seek
ways to cut deeply into Japan's $49 billion trade surplus with the
United States.
   Those re-elected included former Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita, 65, who resigned last year after admitting that he
accepted huge donations from the Recruit Co.; and Takeshita's
replacement, Sousuke Uno, 67, who lasted only two months as prime
minister. A former geisha said Uno had paid her to be his mistress,
and he resigned after the Liberal Democrats lost badly in the upper
house election.
   Another winner was former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, 72,
who resigned from the party in disgrace last year. He ran as an
independent.
   ``A general election is a judgment by the people, and I
passed,'' said Nakasone. The Recruit scandal erupted after he left
office in 1987, but the stocks-for-favors transactions took place
while he was prime minister, and he was forced to testify to
Parliament about his links to the Recruit Co.
   Nakasone's re-election may permit him to return to the party and
greater behind-the-scenes influence.
   Former Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe, 65, seen as a likely
successor to Kaifu, also won re-election despite Recruit links that
forced him to step down as party secretary general, a post that
often is a stepping stone to the prime minister's office.
   The only Recruit-linked candidate who lost was Kunio Takaishi, a
former vice minister of education who is under indictment for
bribery. Late Sunday, police arrested one of his private
secretaries on charges of handing out cash to voters.
   Voters' commends indicated a wariness of handing power to the
Socialists.
   
   Takashi Aida, 40 and self-employed, said he voted for the
Socialists in last summer's election for the less powerful upper
house, but voted for a Liberal Democrat on Sunday.
   ``It is different this time because we are voting for the lower
house. ... Opposition parties wouldn't be able to handle politics
in the lower house,'' he said.
   A 31-year-old doctor said he was no Liberal Democratic Party
supporter, ``but I just had to choose (them) because nobody else is
capable.''

<HEAD>Drexel Agrees to Transfer Mortgage-backed Securities Portfolio to
Goldman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. has agreed to
transfer its portfolio of mortgage-backed securities to Goldman,
Sachs &amp; Co., the two investment banks announced.
   The transfer was encouraged and facilitated by the Securities
and Exchange Commission, the two firms said.
   A spokesman for Drexel, whose parent company filed for Chapter
11 bankruptcy protection last week, said he did not know if Goldman
Sachs would pay anything for the portfolio.
   The two firms said Drexel's holdings of securities for current
settlement was modest in size and its holdings for future
settlement was a diversified, hedged portfolio of government agency
and mortgage-backed securities.
   The transfer is subject to the consent of counterparties who had
entered into trades with Drexel, the firms said. They added that
they hope to complete the transfer by Thursday.
   Drexel has been liquidating its securities holdings since its
bankruptcy filing and has been working to transfer customer
accounts to other brokerages. The firm laid off the bulk of its
5,300 employees on Friday and is closing down rapidly following the
failure of its parent holding company to obtain financing early
last week.
