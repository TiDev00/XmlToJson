   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - Gunmen killed at least five people
and wounded 54 Wednesday night following a campaign rally by a
radical priest who is front-runner in the Dec. 16 presidential
elections, radio reports and witnesses said.
   The violence by unknown assailants in Petionville, seven miles
outside the capital of Port-au-Prince, occurred during a 10-minute
blackout at about 7:30 p.m., after the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide
spoke to about 10,000 people.
   Aristide is considered a hero of the young and poor in this
violence-prone Caribbean island nation of 6 million people. Haiti
is the poorest country in the Western hemisphere.
   Aristide, 37, was reported unharmed. He has survived at least
three assassination attempts since 1987.
   Witnesses said men in a jeep drove moments after the blackout
and that a big explosion was followed by gunfire.
   ``It happened during the blackout. There was a big boom. We ran,
and while we were running there was shooting. The lights went on
after,'' said one witness, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Hundreds of people ran screaming down the streets after the
explosion rocked the affluent suburb. Scores of people fell to the
ground.
   Witnesses and Radio Metropole said five people died and 54 were
wounded.
   What caused the blast was not known, nor was it known if the
violence was directly aimed at Aristide or meant to cow supporters
into not voting for him.
   Minister of Interior Joseph Maxi said, ``All necessary steps
have been taken, and an investigation has been opened.''
   Dr. Robert Jean Louis, a physician treating wounded at the
scene, said all the victims appeared to have been shot. He said one
woman he hoisted into an ambulance died of bullet wounds.
   In nearby Delmas, the party headquarters of the Movement to
Organize the Country also was broken into by three men, the offices
ransacked and its guard severely beaten, witnesses said. The
Movement supports Aristide's candidacy.
   This was the first election-related violence since the
presidential campaign began in October.
   In November 1987 elections, at least 34 people were killed by
thugs at the polling stations. Hundreds had died during the
campaign in political violence.
   Wednesday's violence darkened hopes Haiti could at last have
democratic elections, the first in the country's 186-year-old
history. More than 400 observers, including former President Jimmy
Carter and about 60 unarmed U.N. military advisers, were to monitor
the balloting.
   Haiti is the first U.N. member to ask the world body to observe
balloting.
   The country has been rocked by violence and political turmoil
since the fall of President-for-life Jean-Claude Duvalier. His
flight into exile in France in 1986 ended 29 years of Duvalier
family dictatorship that began with his late father Francois ``Papa
Doc'' Duvalier in 1957.
   The interim government of President Ertha Pascal Trouillot,
appointed in March, is the fifth since Duvalier's fall.
   An ardent critic of Duvalier while he was in power, Aristide has
many enemies in hard-line Duvalierist circles.
   He reluctantly became a candidate at the prompting of a
center-left organization which sought to offset the candidacy of
Roger Lafontant, reputed head of the Tonton Macoutes, the feared
secret militia of the Duvaliers.
   Lafontant came back from exile in July to run for president. The
Electoral Council disqualified him for technical reasons but he
vowed at the time to fight the decision.
   A former Salesian priest, Aristide was expelled from the
conservative Roman Catholic order in December 1988 for allegedly
fomenting revolution.
   Three months earlier, hoodlums backed by the army stormed into
his Saint Jean Bosco Church and killed at least 12 parishioners.
Aristide was shielded by his flock and unharmed.
   His critics accuse Aristide of demagoguery. They say his
presidency is based on emotional appeal and would pose the threat
of a theocratic dictatorship.
   Many Haitiians had feared Aristide's candidacy would provoke new
violence.

   The Palestine Liberation Organization on
Wednesday urged the Security Council to send U.N. staff to the
Israel-occupied territories to help protect Palestinians.
   The United States, however, could veto any resolution calling
for deployment of U.N. personnel, appointment of an ombudsman or
convening of an international human rights convention to help the
Palestinians.
   Negotiations were continuing in efforts to devise a draft
resolution that could be adopted by consensus, or avert a U.S. veto
in defense of its Israeli ally.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. reported the United States has
proposed that the Security Council consider convening a broad
Middle East peace conference.
   The idea was discussed at a meeting of the five permanent
members of the council, who agreed to it, said the BBC, attributing
its report to unidentified diplomatic sources.
   The New York Times reported in Thursday's editions th United
States would not oppose a call for an international Middle East
peace conference to settle the Palestinian question in a resolution
criticizing Israel's treatment of Arabs in the territories.
   U.S. representative Thomas Pickering denied at midday Wednesday
that Washington was making any proposal on the Palestinian issue.
State Dept. spokesman David Denny said later he was aware of the
BBC report but had no comment.
   Soviet Ambassador Yuli Vorontsov told reporters he did not
expect a U.S. veto but declined to discuss details of a possible
consensus resolution. The council was to meet against Thursday and
could vote on a resolution on protecting Palestinians.
   ``I don't think there should be any question of a veto because
we are working differently now ... on a consensus basis and that's
a sign of the times.''
   After more than three months of close cooperation and consensus,
he said, ``the council now is not interested in scoring points or
in passing resolutions that will be vetoed by the other members.''
   The Soviet envoy commented after informal consultations among
the five permanent members, including the United States, Britain,
China and France. He said the council was ``not interested in the
resolutions, we are interested in solutions.''
   Earlier Farouk Kaddoumi, the PLO foreign affairs spokesman, told
the Security Council that it had a moral obligation to protect
Palestinians from what he called Israeli crimes, like the shooting
deaths of at least 19 Palestinians on Temple Mount on Oct. 8.
   He told the 15-member council that the United Nations should do
no less for Palestinians under Israeli occupation than it has done
for Kuwaitis under Iraqi occupation.
   ``We call upon your august council to establish a permanent
presence of the United Nations and its personnel in the occupied
Palestinian territories, in the context of an established
mechanism, based on monitoring the situation and submitting
periodic reports.''
   His speech was delivered as the council continued an
intermittent monthlong debate about how to help safeguard the
rights of Palestinians in the Israeli- held territories.
   He also blamed the United States for protecting Israel ``and its
criminal practices.'' He said that the contradiction between
council actions in the case of Kuwaitis under occupation and its
inaction in the case of Palestinians ``has come to jeopardize its
credibility and prestige and to cast doubt on its potential to play
its required role in our new world.''
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar told reporters
Wednesday that he intends to send his special envoy, Jean-Claude
Aime, to Israel to discuss the Palestinian problem after the
council concludes its debate this week.
   Several draft resolutions currently are in circulation and
United States is meeting with various council members in an effort
to find an acceptable resolution.
   PLO officials said if there is no agreement, then they will push
for a vote Thursday on a tough resolution sponsored by Colombia,
Cuba, Malaysia and Yemen.
   That resolution calls for the council to appoint an ombudsman to
the territories ``to monitor and observe the situation, with the
help of the U.N. personnel stationed there, and to report on it to
the secretary-general and the Security Council.''

<HEAD>Ozal Increasingly Isolated as Opposition to His Policies Mounts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Turgut Ozal, often praised by
President Bush as a loyal ally for his strong support in the
Persian Gulf crisis, is on slippery ground at home.
   The 63-year-old president is increasingly isolated, has little
public support and often faces criticism from establishment groups
and members of his own Motherland Party.
   The resignation of the chief of staff on Monday indicated Ozal
also had alienated the military as well - the most powerful
establishment group in Turkey.
   Gen. Necip Torumtay, who was succeeded Tuesday by Gen. Dogan
Gures, stepped down not so much over a specific issue but to
protest a style of government, sources close to the military said.
   Since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, Ozal has run a one-man show
concerning Turkey's gulf policy, often bypassing Cabinet members
and the Foreign Ministry.
   A few days after the invasion, for example, reporters told the
foreign minister that pipelines carrying Iraqi crude oil through
Turkey were being closed to comply with a U.N. trade embargo.
   In October, Foreign Minister Ali Bozer resigned. Defense
Minister Safa Giray quit the next month.
   Some observers fear Ozal may lead Turkey into a Middle East war.
   ``Who else but Bush still supports Ozal's style of government?''
asked columnist Turker Alkan in the daily Gunes. ``Could a nation
of 50 million be pushed into war behind the United States just
because Ozal wants it when everyone, from 15-year-olds to the chief
of staff, is opposed to war?''
   Ozal was elected prime minister in 1983 when the military turned
over power to civilians in general elections. He won re-election in
1987 but his party was badly beaten two years later.
   The parliament, where the Motherland Party enjoys a large
majority, elected him president - his term runs until 1995 - that
year. Ozal moved to Cankaya Palace, turning over the prime
minister's job to a loyal follower, Yildirim Akbulut.
   Opposition politicians say Ozal is running the government even
though the presidency is supposed to be a mainly ceremonial post.
They hope to win enough votes in the next elections to change the
constitution and unseat him.
   Ozal is also opposed by organized labor. At a meeting Tuesday to
discuss productivity, labor representatives marched out in protest
when Ozal entered the hall. Nationwide, 48,000 miners are on strike
to protest the government's insistence on low wages.
   Businessmen, once Ozal's allies and supporters of his free
market policies, now grumble about what they say is widespread
corruption in government and the lack of a coordinated economic
policy.
   The educated elite and other secularist Turks, meanwhile, are
demanding an end to government policies and hiring practices deemed
favorable to Islamic fundamentalists. Their discontent is shared by
the traditionally secular military.
   In a farewell message to Turkey's 800,000-strong armed forces,
Torumtay said ``the road shown by Ataturk'' was ``the goal which
cannot be deviated from.''
   He referred to Kemal Ataturk, founder of modern Turkey in 1923
and proponent of a Western-allied, secular state.
   The military has toppled civilian governments three times since
1960. The latest takeover was in 1980, following a period of
political violence that claimed 5,000 lives.

<HEAD>The Ethics Committee's Blunt Special Investigator</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</NOTE>
<HEAD>With PM-Keating-Senators, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A United States senator was shouting
accusations at Robert S. Bennett when the special ethics counsel
began to fidget in his black swivel chair.
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini was good and mad, gesturing vividly while
he complained that Bennett was out to get him and the other
so-called Keating Five.
   Bennett squirmed in his seat while DeConcini hurled accusations:
Bennett was personally trying to write new standards of conduct for
the Senate. Bennett was no longer a independent investigator, but a
prosecutor who wanted the five senators as a trophy.
   Finally, the senator sat down. The Senate Ethics Committee
hearing room was quiet as the stocky attorney rose to speak in
rebuttal.
   ``These are not my standards,'' Bennett said, speaking directly
to the committee with a forceful voice but not hurrying his words.
``And just because you can't go to the Government Printing Office
and say, `Hey, give me the ethical standard that covers all
situations' doesn't mean they don't exist. Gentlemen, you're a lot
better than that.''
   While many lawyers hired by Congress to conduct a highly visible
investigation may show great reverence to U.S. senators, Bennett is
not one of them. He is not intimidated by the committee members who
hired him or the lawmakers he was brought in to investigate.
   Bennett, 51, is known for his straightforward - even blunt -
speech.
   ``He is a no-nonsense litigator who has a way of getting across
to a whole spectrum of different people,'' said Peter P. Mullen,
executive partner of the 1,100-lawyer, New York-based firm of
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom - which hired Bennett this
year. ``He can talk to princes and paupers, kings and the
homeless.''
   Bennett's expertise is in defending businessmen accused of white
collar crimes. Mullen said his firm scoured the country before
hiring him to head its white collar practice. By the time the deal
was completed, Bennett had brought along, from his former firm, 14
other lawyers, three legal assistants and four secretaries.
   The Ethics Committee also could point to Bennett's experience
when he was hired a year ago to investigate Sens. DeConcini,
D-Ariz.; John McCain, R-Ariz.; Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich.; John
Glenn, D-Ohio and Alan Cranston, D-Calif. The five intervened with
thrift regulators on behalf of former S&amp;L owner Charles H. Keating
Jr., a political contributor.
   Bennett was special counsel in the investigation of Sen. Dave
Durenberger, R-Minn., who the Senate denounced earlier this year
for financial misconduct.
   And he performed the same role in the case of former Sen.
Harrison A. Williams Jr., D-N.J., who quit the Senate in 1982 just
as the chamber was about to expel him for bribery.
   Bennett's response to DeConcini in the opening days of the
ongoing ethics committee hearing told a lot about himself.
   He told the committee the only trophy he wanted was the one he
already had in the wall of his office, which also has a panoramic
view of the Washington Monument and environs.
   The trophy is a stuffed, 5-pound, 2-ounce brown trout he caught
in 1985. Underneath the fish is a saying that Bennett shows clients
in hopes they'll heed the advice: ``If I had kept my mouth shut, I
wouldn't be here.''
   And he reminded the committee that many Senate standards of
conduct were not written by him but by former Sen. Paul Douglas of
Illinois in 1951 - when Bennett was growing up in Brooklyn and only
interested in the Dodgers.
   Bennett's rebuttal also mentioned his three teenage daughters,
to make the point that even the school they attended has standards
of conduct.
   ``Whenever I have a case I feel is important, I always work my
daughters in,'' Bennett said later. ``It's just something to make
them feel good, to let them know I'm thinking about them.''
   Sitting in his office for an interview, Bennett - remembered
that he may be focused on his work now, but once was more
interested in cutting school to watch games at old Ebbitts Field.
   ``One day I was yelling `Come on Pee Wee (Reese) and I felt a
hand on my shoulder. It was my father,'' Bennett said, who had been
tipped off by a friend that his son was at the ballpark.
   Bennett's father, a banker officer, expressed his displeasure
that day. But now, Bennett says, ``I have one request for this
story. Mention my father. F. Robert Bennett.''
   Bennett is not the only high-profile member of his family.
Younger brother William is incoming chairman of the Republican
National Committee, formerly the national drug czar and a secretary
of education. Robert Bennett, though, says he's strictly
non-political.
   A favorite hoby is fishing for brown trout in Montana and a
year ago, Bennett bought a home near Livingston, along the
Yellowstone River.
   ``Bob is a good spin fisherman, but now he's trying to become a
good fly fisherman,'' said Bennett's pal Lenny Gregrey, of
Livingston, a retired New York City police lieutenant.
   ``His only frustration is he can't tie knots. His fingers won't
work. I gave him a written test and he got all flustered,'' Gregrey
said of his usually unflappable friend.
   ``He was sweating over the questions.''

   Need a new mattress, but don't feel like getting
out of bed? Slumber comfort is just a phone call away - as are
dream dates, decorators, teachers and T-shirts, all via the city's
assorted Dial-A lines.
   Dial-A-Floor. Dial-A-Chef. Dial-A-Hearing Test. In New York,
where time is always tight, you can get everything from soup to
nuts - and a redecorated kitchen to eat them in - with nothing more
than a touch-tone phone.
   ``You can call us from your office, from your home, from your
car - doesn't matter. And within two hours, we can deliver you a
mattress,'' said Joe Vicens, vice president of sales and marketing
at Dial-A-Mattress.
   ``We get close to 1,000 calls a day,'' he said. ``On a top day,
we get 1,500 calls.''
   It wasn't always so. For seven years, Vicens answered the phones
alone. But times have changed; there are more two-job families,
less time to shop. And it's so easy to punch in 1-800-MATTRES
(nobody said spelling was a requirement for sales).
   Dial-A-Mattress was born 12 years ago when a small furniture
company owner, Napoleon Barrigan, spotted a ``dial-a-steak
promotion in one of the papers,'' Vicens recalled. ``This gave him
the idea for Dial-A-Mattress. Surprisingly, a lot of people started
calling.''
   The steak idea is still hot. Dial-A-Chef will dispatch a
genuine, trained cook to your residence to prepare the repast of
your choice.
   ``We are not a catering service. If you're planning a dinner
party, you call us up. We send over a chef who prepares an entire
meal right in your home,'' said manager Charles Dean, whose company
opened last year.
   He has about two dozen chefs, who handle everything from
vegetarian delights to fine French cuisine. The chefs get $20 to
$50 an hour; they work a minimum of four hours, and raw materials
cost extra, said Dean.
   Since man does not live by bed alone - or by pheasant under
glass - there are Dial-A-Prayer and Dial-An-Atheist.
   ``I give thanks, O God, that because I believe in thee, I can be
positive about life. ... Remove the fears from my heart, I pray,
for fears draw negative feelings. Prune my thoughts of defeat,''
intoned Tuesday's Dial-A-Prayer.
   Thus inspired, it's on to the secular, like Dial-A-Hearing Test.
There was no answer there, leading a caller to believe it
apparently works this way: If you can hear the phone ringing, your
ears are OK.
   Obviously in demand: secretaries. There are three
Dial-A-Secretary numbers for people seeking temporary office
assistance, a figure outdone only by Penthouse magazine's risque
Dial-A-Forum Letter and its five exchanges.
   Overall, Manhattan offers 40 Dial-A services - uh, make that 39.
Out of business: Dial-A-Dentist. ``I'm sure you've got the wrong
number. This is a shoe store,'' advised the worker answering the
phone at the line once used for oral aid.
   The services are not only for adults. Students stumped by
homework can Dial-A-Teacher from Monday through Thursday, 4-7 p.m.
Instructors take phone calls and provide instant assistance in both
English and Spanish.
   People looking to get dressed but not dressed up can ring Dial A
T-Shirt, where custom print jobs are a specialty. These guys will
put anything you want on a hat, T-shirt or sweatshirt, said manager
Dean Artenberg.
   Unfortunately, people still must come down to the store to pick
up their orders, although Artenberg said he can understand why
they'd rather do their business by phone only.
   ``It's getting to where you go out on the street around here,
you might not ever be coming back,'' he observed.

<HEAD>Some Democrats Discuss Surtax if War Breaks Out</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some top congressional Democrats say that if
war breaks out in the Persian Gulf, lawmakers should consider an
income tax surcharge to raise the tens of billions of dollars the
fighting likely would cost.
   The idea - similar to the surtax that helped finance the Vietnam
war - drew a negative response from one White House official and a
mostly skeptical reaction from several Republican congressional
leaders Tuesday.
   Nonetheless, some Democrats say a war against Iraq would be so
expensive that it would be a blow to the weakening economy if the
government was forced to borrow the money.
   ``War is a very expensive proposition,'' said Senate Budget
Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn., who was among the first
to publicly discuss the idea. ``If we go into a war, we have to
find some way to pay for it, not to shove these costs onto future
generations by borrowing.''
   The proposal has yet to be embraced by House Speaker Thomas
Foley, D-Wash., or Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine.
   But for Democrats skeptical of attacking Iraq soon, calling for
a surtax underscores the domestic price of going to war.
   Sasser said he envisions a surtax of about 5 percent to 10
percent.
   During the height of U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia,
President Johnson persuaded Congress to approve a 10 percent income
tax surcharge to pay for the war. Taxpayers would calculate the
amount of money they owed the government, and simply increase it by
10 percent.
   The surtax was in effect from April 1968 through December 1969.
Because of it, fiscal 1969 was the last time the federal budget ran
a surplus, finishing $3.2 billion in the black.
   Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the House Budget
Committee, agreed that a surtax should be weighed if fighting
breaks out in the Persian Gulf.
   ``The prevalent view is if we sustain our current level of
operations, we'd be able to handle that,'' Panetta said. ``When you
go beyond that into a full-scale war, that's when the question
marks start coming.''
   ``If war occurs and we incur substantial costs, do we need to
come up with a way to pay for it? Absolutely yes,'' said Rep. Steny
Hoyer, D-Md., a member of the House Democratic leadership.
   One White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said it would be premature to talk about using a surtax to pay for
a war against Iraq.
   ``And it's not clear that that's the way to go,'' the official
said.
   Republican lawmakers seemed mostly opposed to the idea, although
House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., said, ``I'm not going
to prejudge anything.''
   ``We may have to consider cutting spending to pay for those
costs,'' said No. 2 House Republican Newt Gingrich of Georgia, who
led the anti-tax faction of the House GOP during this year's budget
negotiations. ``I know that's an unthinkable alternative for Sasser
and Panetta.''
   The administration has not released an estimate of what a war in
the gulf would cost.
   In September, when the United States was building a force of
240,000 troops, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said the price of
maintaining it would be $15 billion this fiscal year. Last month,
President Bush said he would add 200,000 troops to the total, but
the administration has provided no new cost estimate.
   Democrats, citing studies by private defense analysts, say
fighting could cost $1 billion to $2 billion per day. Republicans,
using experts of their own, say a three-month war could cost $15
billion to $30 billion.
   Under new budget procedures, the costs of U.S. operations in the
Middle East will not be counted as part of the official federal
deficit. But to pay its military expenses in the gulf, the
government will have to either raise taxes, cut spending or borrow
money.

   A 13-year-old boy was detained
after he drove his uncle's car across Moravia and tried to sell it
for nearly $4,200 to a man on the street, the state news agency CTK
reported.
   The boy stole the car, which was recently purchased and without
license plates, from his uncle and drove it about 80 miles from
Hodonin to Ostrova, the news agency said in Tuesday's report.
   In Ostrova, the boy tried to sell the car for 100,000 crowns
(nearly $4,200) to a man on the street, then lowered his asking
price to 20,000 crowns, the agency said.
   When asked by the police how he managed to drive the distance on
icy roads, the boy said: ``I have some experience from the years
when I was younger.''

   A thief can steal more money with a computer
than with a gun and a terrorist can spread more chaos with a
keyboard than with a bomb, experts said today.
   ``We are at risk,'' the National Research Council said in a
300-page report. ``Increasingly, America depends on computers. They
control power delivery, communications, aviation and financial
services.
   ``They are used to store vital information, from medical records
to business plans to criminal records. Although we trust them, they
are vulnerable.''
   The report, titled ``Computers at Risk,'' calls for a coherent
national effort to develop security systems and increase public
awareness of the dangers posed by vulnerable computers to accidents
and deliberate attack.
   ``To date, we have been remarkably lucky,'' the council said.
   It pointed out that although money and information have been
stolen, lives have been lost because of computer errors and
communications and financial systems have been disrupted, there has
been no systematic attempt to subvert critical computing systems.
   ``Unfortunately, there is reason to believe that our luck will
soon run out,'' the report said. ``Thus far we have relied on the
absence of malicious people who are both capable and motivated. We
can no longer do so. We must instead attempt to build computer
systems that are secure and trustworthy.''
   As evidence of how untrustworthy computers are, the report
listed these examples:
   -A nearly successful attempt to use thousands of phony Bank of
America automatic teller machine cards fabricated with personal
identification numbers stolen from an on-line data base.
   -Thousands of reported virus attacks and hundreds of different
viruses identified, such as Stoned, Devil's Dance, 1260, Jerusalem,
Yankee Doodle, Pakistani Brain, Icelandic-2, Ping Pong and December
24.
   -A software design error that froze much of American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph's long distance network.
   -The German Chaos Computer Club break-ins to the NASA Space
Physics Analysis Network.
   -The 1988 Internet ``worm'' incident. Robert Morris of Arnold,
Md., is appealing his conviction in federal court for unleashing a
program that paralyzed thousands of computers linked to the
nationwide program.
   -An error in computer software controlling a radiation therapy
machine, a Therac 25 linear accelerator, resulted in at least three
patient deaths.
   -A Cleveland man allegedly mailed more than 26,000
virus-infected diskettes with AIDS prevention information to
hospitals, businesses and government agencies worldwide.
   ``Whatever trust was justified in the past will not be justified
in the future unless action is taken now,'' the report said.
   It recommended that an institution be created to accelerate the
commercialization and adoption of safer and more secure computer
and communications systems.
   A major activity of the group would be to evaluate products with
respect to security. ``The organization must not be ... a captive
of government, system vendors or individual segments of the user
community,'' the report said.
   But it would need the highest level of government support, even
a congressional charter, the report said, adding, ``The committee
sees this proposal as a test of commitment for industry.''
   The National Research Council is an arm of the National Academy
of Sciences, a private organization chartered by Congress.

   The pilot of a DC-9 that collided in fog
with another jetliner on an airport runway, killing eight people,
returned to the cockpit only last week from a five-year medical
leave, officials said Tuesday.
   The National Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday night that
Northwest Airlines Capt. William Lovelace was at the controls
Monday when the plane ran into a Boeing 727 racing for takeoff at
Detroit Metropolitan Airport.
   Investigators said earlier Tuesday it was unclear whether
Lovelace, of Phoenix, or his first officer, James F. Schifferns of
Spokane, Wash., was piloting the plane.
   Schifferns, who spent 20 years in the Air Force, was hired by
Northwest in March, his first job in commercial aviation.
   NTSB investigators said they were looking at such factors as
human error, weather and equipment as possible causes of the
accident.
   A fireball fed by fuel burned away the top of the
Pittsburgh-bound DC-9 after the right wingtip of the Northwest 727
tore open the DC-9's fuselage and dislodged an engine.
   Noxious fumes killed six men and two women among the 43 people
aboard the DC-9, said Wayne County Chief Medical Examiner Bader
Cassin. Seven people remained hospitalized, two of them in critical
condition.
   I.C. Payne, a passenger on the DC-9, said he couldn't see much
out his window and just remembers a piece of shrapnel striking him
on the head.
   ``It nearly knocked me out of my seat,'' said Payne, a quality
inspector for General Electric based in Fort Wayne, Ind. ``The
first thing I did was reach up to see if all my head was still on.
Then I heard someone in the front of the plane yell out that the
engine just blew.''
   NBC news reported Tuesday night that it had obtained partial
transcripts of an exchange between an air traffic controller and
the DC-9 cockpit.
   That exchange showed the controller asking the pilot to verify
his position. ``Uh, we're not sure. It's so foggy out here, we're
completely stuck here. Looks like we're on 21-Center here,'' NBC
quoted the transcripts as saying.
   The collision occurred near the end of runway 3C, which leads
directly into runway 21C. The DC-9 turned off a taxiway into runway
3C and into the path of the 727, officials said.
   The Federal Aviation Administration said it had not reviewed the
control tower transcripts and could not comment on the NBC report.
   NTSB spokesman Alan Pollock said ``we obviously had interviews
with people in the tower and we have determined the DC-9 was having
visibility problems. As far as exact wording, I cannot comment on
that.''
   The crew of another Northwest flight reported overhearing a
flight crew say they were unsure of their location, but that they
thought they were on runway 3C, said NTSB spokesman John Lauber. He
said it hadn't been determined whether the transmission came from
the DC-9 or another plane that may have been on the wrong runway.
   Among those killed was Heidi Joost, 43, of Dearborn, a flight
attendant who worked for Northwest since 1968. Five other victims
were identified Tuesday night as Kingsley A. Brown, 30, of
Pittsburgh, Pa., Mary Blankenship, 37, of Colorado Springs, Colo.,
Thomas Kopriva, 50, Daniel Loughnane, 44, and Fred Zitto, 59, all
of Memphis.
   The names of the others were unavailable from the medical
examiner because their bodies were so badly charred. Cassin said
dental records were being sought to make positive identification,
which Northwest spokesman Kevin Whalen said could come Wednesday.
   Another Northwest spokesman, Bob Gibbons, said the flight was
Lovelace's first without another pilot observing since he returned
to flying Nov. 25. He spent five years on medical leave for kidney
stones, Gibbons said. Airline officials refused to provide further
details on Lovelace's leave.
   Lovelace, 52, of Phoenix, had two weeks of ground school and 13
hours of simulator flying after he was medically cleared Oct. 10 to
return to work. Five of Lovelace's 12 flights between Nov. 25 and
Nov. 30 had been into or out of Detroit.
   Schifferns, 37, of Spokane, Wash., was hired by Northwest after
a military career in which he flew a variety of planes, including
B-52 bombers. It was unknown how many of Schifferns' previous
flights began r ended at Detroit. He had 150 hours flying with the
airline.
   At the time of the crash, visibility was estimated by the air
traffic controllers' union at a quarter-mile. The ground was wet
from a snow and sleet storm that delayed flights at the airport. It
was closed at the time to inbound flights.
   Gibbons, the Northwest spokesman, said if visibility was less
than a quarter-mile, FAA rules require the tower should to ground
all departing flights.
   The National Air Traffic Controllers Association said it
appeared Lovelace or Schifferns taxied the plane onto the runway
without clearance from the tower. The Federal Aviation
Administration, which is responsible for air traffic controllers,
did not respond to the union's statement.
   Recordings of cockpit conversations were being analyzed Tuesday
in Washington.
   The Memphis-bound 727 had 153 people aboard. Some suffered minor
scrapes and bruises when sliding down emergency slides.
   Romulus, 10 miles from Detroit, was the site of the second worst
air crash in U.S. history, the Aug. 16, 1987, crash of a Northwest
MD-80 on takeoff. That crash killed 156.

   After Nasser was
released from a six-year prison term for attacking Israeli
soldiers, he was hoping to find a job and settle down to a normal
life.
   That didn't happen.
   Instead, Nasser, 27, was ordered to turn in his orange,
Israeli-issued identification card. It was replaced by a green one
that says in Hebrew and Arabic: ``The holder of this card is not
allowed to enter Israel.''
   Nasser is one of at least 2,400 Palestinians in the West Bank
getting green cards under new strictures following more than a
dozen stabbing attacks by Palestinians on Israelis in the past two
months.
   Having a green card prevents the holders from working in Israel,
where Palestinians have provided much of the cheap labor as
restaurant workers, garbage men or - as in Nasser's case -
construction workers.
   ``I thought my punishment ended, but I guess it is just
beginning,'' said Nasser, who was interviewed at his father's home
in this refugee camp near Bethlehem. He asked that the family name
not be used for fear of reprisal.
   Nasser was jailed for fire-bombings aimed at Israel patrols and
attacks on Palestinians suspected of collaborating with Israel. He
says no one was killed or injured in the incidents.
   He feels he paid his dues in prison and worries that he will
have trouble supporting himself and won't be able to help his
retired parents.
   ``It's like being back in prison,'' he said.
   Nasser was in jail while tensions grew enormously between Arabs
and Israelis during the last three years of the Palestinian
uprising.
   In the past two months, stabbing attacks by Arabs seeking
revenge for the deaths of 17 Palestinians in Jerusalem's Temple
Mount riots have brought counterattacks by Israelis and increased
calls for blocking Palestinians from entering Israel.
   Following a fatal stabbing attack Sunday in Greater Tel Aviv -
the coastal area that is Israel's main population center - hundreds
of police on Tuesday set up checkpoints on roads leading to the
Jewish state.
   Police not only checked for green cards but frisked any
Palestinian trying to cross the Green Line, Israel's boundary with
the West Bank and Gaza Strip before it seized the territories in
the 1967 Middle East war.
   Green cards were first issued to Palestinians in February 1989,
but the program has been stepped up in the past month.
   Shmuel Ozenboy, a spokesman for the military government of the
occupied territories, said the 2,400 new green cards issued brings
to 10,800 the number of Palestinians barred from entering Israel
because of crimes or anti-Israeli activities.
   News reports said that following Sunday's Tel Aviv attack
officials were considering raising the total of banned Palestinians
to about 15,000.
   The number could potentially include any of the 60,000 people
jailed during the Palestinian uprising, including thousands held
without ever being formally charged or tried.
   Economics Minister David Magen already has suggested that the
110,000 Palestinians who work in Israel be cut to 50,000 to create
jobs for the thousands of Soviet Jews being resettled in Israel.
   Similar calls for banning Palestinians in the past have been
thwarted by employers' dependence on cheap Palestinian labor and
Israelis' distaste for menial jobs.
   Defense Minister Moshe Arens argued at a Parliament committee
this wee  that it would be naive to expect to instantly end
Israel's dependence on cheap Arab labor.
   ``We should change the state of affairs but it would only be
possible in gradual stages and with planning,'' he said.
   Both Palestinians and Israelis have warned that cutting off
Palestinians from jobs - when they are frustrated at the uprising's
failure to produce political gains - could further increase
violence.
   Job openings in the territories are almost nonexistent because
Israel routinely refuses permits for factories, keeping the West
Bank and Gaza a captive market. The uprising has further reduced
jobs for the 1.7 million Palestinians in the territories.
   Abdul Fatah Abu Shukur, dean of the economics department at
An-Najah University in the West Bank city of Nablus, said the
territories' unemployment rate of more than 25 percent would be
driven up by the green cards.

   Voters in one of Mississippi's three
coastal counties narrowly approved dockside gambling Tuesday. The
other counties turned it down.
   Hancock County became the third Mississippi county to approve
casino-type, cruise vessel gambling.
   The Hancock vote was 4,246 in favor and 4,004 against, according
to unofficial returns. The referendum failed in Harrison County
18,490 to 17,463, and lost 15,351 to 9,508 in Jackson County.
   Opponents of legalized gambling in the Gulf of Mexico charged
passage would change a community's way of life by encouraging crime
and weakening morality; proponents said tax dollars and new jobs
would bring an economic windfall.
   Charles Phillips, a consultant hired by the anti-gambling
Citizens for Quality of Life, said the group researched the effects
of gambling on the economies of Deadwood, S.D., and Atlantic City,
N.J., and found that the communities weren't revitalized at all.
   There are no restrictions on the casinos' size or operations
except that they have to be aboard a ship or riverboat. The kind of
gambling, either high stakes or small amounts, would be determined
by each individual ship.
   Applicants to operate casino vessels in Hancock County still
face the screening process before the Mississippi Tax Commission.
Lawmakers expect it will take about a year for such a gaming
operation to open up.
   The gambling issue has been debated as economic boons to
depressed economies. Civic leaders on the coast and the Mississippi
river counties have pushed for greater tourism revenue, which is
off after several conventions normally reserved for the coast moved
to Florida or Louisiana.
   Casino ships are not allowed to open their casinos once they get
into international waters.

   Eastern Germans are being asked to invite Soviet
soldiers into their homes for Christmas.
   A group called the German Society has appealed to local Germans
to share their holidays ``to show a bit of human politics from
people to people,'' the ADN news agency said Tuesday.
   About 360,000 Soviet soldiers are stationed in the lands that
once were East Germany. The German government has promised massive
aid in the next four years to help return them to the Soviet Union,
where housing is in short supply.
   The German Society was founded in January with the goal of
bettering cultural and economic relations between then-East and
West Germany.
   Among the group's curators are former West German Chancellor
Willy Brandt, and Eberhard Diepgen, who won Sunday's election for
the first mayor of united Berlin.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Rights Advocates Question GOP Commitment to
Blacks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's selection of conservative
William Bennett to head the Republican National Committee is
prompting ``I told you so's'' from critics who doubt the party's
commitment to minority concerns.
   Civil rights advocates see the choice of Bennett - an ardent foe
of racial quotas - as a departure from RNC Chairman Lee Atwater's
high-profile effort to woo black voters over the last two years.
   Bush's decision ``sends the wrong signal'' to blacks, especially
following his veto of sweeping civil rights legislation that blacks
considered a litmus test, said Howard University political science
professor Ron Walters.
   ``It lends credence to my opinion that the Republican Party was
never really serious about this,'' Walters said, voicing the
opinion of many who have been suspicious of the GOP's intentions.
   However, RNC officials insist that Bennett will continue the
minority outreach program, and that his staunch opposition to
minority hiring quotas should not affect that.
   Atwater, who is battling a brain tumor and will remain as the
party's general chairman, often said his long-range goal was to
bring more minorities to the party.
   It also was his short-term goal for the 1990 election in which
22 percent of the blacks voted for Republicans in congressional
races, according to a New York Times-CBS News poll. That was up 7
percentage points from 1988, and double the percentage found in
1982.
   Sources said Atwater urged Bush to sign the civil rights
legislation that came to the president's desk shortly before the
Nov. 6 election.
   Bush vetoed the bill after a fight within his administration.
The president contended it would lead to racial hiring quotas,
although language in the measure said it was not intended to
encourage quotas.
   The selection of Bennett was like salt in the wound after the
veto, said Ralph Neas, executive director of the Leadership
Conference on Civil Rights.
   ``It appears that once again President Bush has cast his lot
with the right wing, his core constituency, with the wealthy and
the privileged,'' Neas charged.
   Bennett has several strikes against him as far as minority
groups are concerned, including his recent help in the racially
tinged re-election bid of Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.
   Bennett defended Helms' campaign advertisements that were widely
criticized for racial overtones, and said North Carolina was ``the
most harmonious place I've been for race relations.'' Helms beat
back a strong challenge by Harvey Gantt, a black Democrat.
   Bennett later said he was eager to do battle with Democrats over
racial quotas and affirmative action.
   When he was President Reagan's chairman of the National
Endowment for the Humanities in the mid-1980s, Bennett refused to
set numerical goals directed by the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission for hiring women and minorities.
   Critics said he steered the endowment's funds away from research
on black and women's studies.
   Then as Reagan's education secretary, Bennett blasted colleges
and universities that he said were imposing unofficial quotas.
   He wrote a book, ``Counting By Race,'' in 1979 that lays out a
historical argument against using quotas for hiring or college
admissions.
   Republican civil rights advocates are trying to put the best
face on Bennett's pending chairmanship. Most recently Bush's
anti-drug czar, he still must be approved by a vote of the
Republican National Committee members.
   RNC spokesman B.J. Cooper said Bennett's ``statements on quotas
mirror exactly the administration's policy'' and that the party is
committed ``more than ever'' to recruiting minority voters and
candidates.
   ``Give the man a chance,'' said Thaddeus Garrett Jr., an
informal adviser to Bush on minority issues and a backer of the
civil rights bill.
   Garrett said he hopes that ``the die is cast, and that Bill
Bennett will have no other desire than to make sure this outreach
program continues.''
   ``It doesn't do me any good not to be hopeful,'' said Garrett.
   Arthur Fletcher, chairman of the Civil Rights Commission, who
also disagreed with Bush on whether the civil rights legislation
was a ``quota bill,'' said he hopes Bennett's appointment will
force a needed debate on civil rights.
   ``Since they made the move and appointed the guy, let's have the
debate. The assumption is that because he's there he's uust going
to turn everybody off ... I'm saying let Bennett express himself,''
said Fletcher.

   Cleaning up the mess left behind
by departing Soviet troops is likely to cost tens of millions of
dollars, the state CTK news agency reports.
   The Ministry of Control estimates that damages to the
environment and to buildings occupied by Soviet troops in Czech
lands for the past 22 years will run as high as $28.5 million, CTK
said Tuesday.
   The estimate did not include the damage caused by Soviet
soldiers in the country's eastern republic, Slovakia.
   According to the report, most historical buildings in northern
Bohemia have been damaged. The area around Ceska Lipa, near the
borders with Poland and what was formerly East Germany are the most
severely damaged, CTK said.
   ``Soviet soldiers vandalized the interior of the castle of Decin
(50 miles north of Prague) and turned the castle's basement into a
reservoir of feces,'' CTK said.
   The pullout of Soviet troops from Czechoslovakia began in
February, but differences over financial compensation for damages
they have caused during their 22-year stay have yet to be resolved.
   Moscow has agreed to withdraw all the troops stationed on
Czechoslovak territory by July 1991.
   The agreement was reached after the peaceful revolution last
year that ousted the Communist leaders put in place after a
Soviet-led invasion in 1968 crushed reform.
   The Soviet Union has a similar agreement with Hungary and that
country is also seeking financial compensation for damages
resulting from the Soviet soldiers' decades-long stay.

<HEAD>European Farmers Usually Prevail in Fights Over Subsidies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Agriculture Department report says there's
a good reason why farmers in the European Community take to the
streets when their subsidies are threatened: the protests have
usually worked.
   In late August, for example, French farmers protested low prices
they had been getting for beef and lamb, blaming cheaper imports
from Britain, Ireland and Eastern Europe.
   Groups of angry French farmers hijacked imported shipments,
destroyed beef and lamb carcasses, and set live animals loose in
town squares. Other acts included killing sheep or lambs in public,
and British trucks carrying live sheep twice were set on fire.
   ``Farmers in the EC stage such protests largely because the
demonstrations are successful,'' the report said. ``The French
agriculture minister, while condemning the demonstrators' violence,
announced measures designed to relieve some of the profit
squeeze.''
   The tradition of protests continued this week as negotiators met
in Brussels in a last-ditch attempt to revamp the world's trading
system.
   Police used tear gas and water cannons on Monday to disperse
30,000 farmers protesting the talks being held under the auspices
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   The so-called Uruguay Round of talks for the liberalization of
world trade has been clouded by persistent snarls over agricultural
issues, primarily the refusal of the 12-nation EC to go along with
substantive reductions in farm subsidies favored by the United
States and most other GATT members.
   European farmers, typically small and heavily dependent on EC
subsidies and protection from outside imports, fear they would be
swamped by the market-oriented policies sought by the others.
   The report, by economist Mary Lisa Madell of USDA's Economic
Research Service, was published in the December issue of
Agricultural Outlook magazine.
   ``Farmers may have a lot to protest, but they face some economic
realities that politicians in Brussels and the national capitals
cannot change,'' the report said.
   For instance, the average size of the EC's 9 million farmers is
only 33 acres, it added. Those averages range from 161 acres in the
United Kingdom to less than 10 acres in Greece.
   The larger, more efficient farms ``can flourish under the high
level of support'' provided by the bloc's Common Agricultural
Policy, or CAP, but many smaller operations still struggle to
survive.
   Until the mid-1980s, the community adjusted prices under the CAP
to ensure that farmers could earn a good living from the land. But
costs grew burdensome and chronic surpluses developed.
   Thus, price supports, or ``intervention'' prices, have remained
stable or have been shaved somewhat since then. Even so, the CAP
price levels are still high compared with world prices, and
overproduction remains a problem, the report said.
   Current attempts in the Uruguay Round to reduce trade-distorting
price supports and phase out longstanding EC export subsidies have
helped stir the conflict further.
   Health scares such as the mysterious new cattle disease - bovine
spongiform encephalopathy or ``mad cow disease'' - in the United
Kingdom and Ireland have taken a toll.
   So have concerns over food poisoning outbreaks and local
scandals over hormones in meat supplies. Animal rights issues are
also worrying livestock producers, the report said.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Agriculture Department has plugged a
loophole that allowed about 5 percent of the peanuts sold for human
consumption to be marketed without federal inspection.
   Officials said the new regulation, which took effect Tuesday,
was required by Congress in legislation a year ago.
   Daniel D. Haley, administrator of the department's Agricultural
Marketing Service, said approximately 95 percent of the peanuts
marketed for human consumption are sold under marketing orders and
are inspected and certified for size, quality and condition.
   The new rule covers those peanuts not covered by the marketing
orders.
   Haley said the agency conducts the program on a fee basis for
peanut handlers. Most handlers operate under a peanut marketing
agreement authorized by federal law.
   An 18-member comittee of peanut producers and handlers
administers the program, which is financed by assessments on
handlers.
   Haley said that under the agreement, peanut handlers are
indemnified for peanuts tested and found unsuitable for human
consumption because of aflatoxin contamination. Aflatoxin, a
naturally occurring chemical that can cause cancer, can result from
a certain kind of crop mold or fungus.
   Only handlers who have signed the agreement are eligible for
indemnification, he said.
   Handlers whose peanuts until now have not been tested - but will
be now, under the new law - may wish to sign the agreement to take
advantage of the indemnification, Haley said.
   Those interested should contact: Peanut Administrative
Committee, P.O. Box 18856, Lenox Square Station, Atlanta, Ga.
30326. Telephone 404-261-7800.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Last year the United States sold $17 million
worth of crayfish to Sweden, up from $6 million in 1988, says the
Agriculture Department.
   Swedes turned to U.S. crayfish providers after their own
domestic supply was jeopardized by a fungus and pollution, the
department's Foreign Agricultural Service said in this month's
AgExporter magazine.
   The small, lobster-like crustaceans are known by many names,
depending on where you buy them. They're crayfish in Sweden. But in
Louisiana, the main source for U.S. exports, the creatures are
crawfish.
   And in Tennessee and many other places, they're crawdads or
something else. Don't ask for crayfish in Australia, the report
said, because the name there is yabbie or marron.

   The head of the Drug Enforcement
Administration says he is pleased that the Justice Department found
no support for news reports his agency was involved in the bombing
of Pan Am Flight 103.
   However, DEA Administrator Robert C. Bonner added Tuesday: ``I'm
concerned that there may be some subliminal impact'' on the
agency's reputation. ``This would be unfortunate, as it is clear
there was no connection between DEA activity of any kind and the
Pan Am 103 tragedy.''
   The Dec. 21, 1988 explosion over Lockerbie, Scotland, killed 259
people aboard the plane and 11 on the ground. The New York-bound
flight originated in Frankfurt with a stop in London, where
passengers and luggage were transferred to another aircraft.
   News reports in late October alleged that terrorists took
advantage of an undercover DEA operation to smuggle explosives
aboard the plane.
   The DEA quickly rebutted the reports, but the parent Justice
Department ordered further inquiries by the DEA and especially the
FBI, the lead U.S. agency investigating the bombing.
   In a statement Tuesday, Deputy Attorney General William P. Barr
said: ``While the investigation is continuing, the FBI has found no
evidence to substantiate recent allegations of a connection between
operations of the DEA and the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103.''
   Bonner said in an interview that he understood the delay.
   ``I think it was appropriate to have the bureau (FBI) take a
look at this,'' he said. ``To totally rule out even a scintilla of
concern has taken several weeks.''
   NBC and ABC had reported, among other things, that the Frankfurt
airport security had been relaxed to accommodate DEA agents
tracking U.S.-bound drug shipments from the Middle East.
   But Bonner said evasion of airport security measures, even to
ensure the success of a sting operation, ``is not something we
do.'' The DEA inquiry found specifically that the agency never
circumvented security measures at the Frankfurt airport.
   The DEA's inquiry also found that it ``had no investigative or
operational activity in effect on Dec. 21, 1988 that involved the
use of Pan Am Flight 103 or Frankfurt International Airport,'' Barr
said.
   In addition, the DEA probe rejected contentions that Flight 103
passenger Khalid Nazir Jaafar of Detroit was part of an undercover
DEA operation.
   Lew Kreindler, a lawyer for U.S. relatives of Flight 103
victims, said last month that the allegation of an undercover drug
operation was an ``old story'' that had surfaced last year in a
British newspaper. He contended it was an attempt to distract
attention from Pan Am, which is being sued by the relatives.
   Pan Am has maintained its security procedures are second only to
those of El Al, the Israeli airline.
   Investigators believe members of the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine conducted the bombing, but the FBI has not
produced enough evidence to bring criminal charges, law enforcement
sources say. British and German authorities also are investigating
the bombing.

   Scientists think they found the smoking gun
to show that asteroids wiped out the dinosaurs: a 110-mile-wide
crater in Mexico possibly gouged by a mountain-size rock smashing
to Earth.
   The crater near the Yucatan Peninsula town of Chicxulub may have
been ``ground zero'' for the collision that some scientists believe
killed dinosaurs 65 million years ago, University of Arizona
scientist Bill Boynton said Tuesday.
   The collision, with the estimated power of 70 million
one-megaton bombs, could have kicked up 3-mile-high tidal waves and
a sparked a worldwide firestorm.
   ``We think we have found the smoking gun, but there may be other
guns and maybe a firing squad,'' Boynton said during a meeting of
the American Geophysical Union.
   Boynton and other researchers said another impact crater 22
miles wide near Manson, Iowa, and possible craters under the
Caribbean near Colombia and Cuba point to the possibility a shower
of asteroids or comets caused the extinction.
   The Yucatan crater Boynton and his colleagues theorize was
caused by an asteroid striking shallow Mexican waters is now on dry
land, buried by 65 million years of sediment.
   The study by Alan Hildebrand, Boynton and others was the latest
of more than 2,000 in the past 12 years that examined whether
asteroids, huge volcanic eruptions or slow climate change sent the
dinosaurs to oblivion.
   In 1978, scientists found deposits of iridium metal in
65-million-year-old rocks around the world. Iridium is rare on
Earth but less rare in asteroids and comets. The killer-asteroid
theory was born because an impact would have spread iridium dust
around the globe.
   The theory is that a 6-mile-wide asteroid or comet - or a comet
shower - smacked into the Earth, kicking debris into the atmosphere
and causing radical environmental damage that wiped out the
dinosaurs and up to 75 percent of all species.
   ``We wouldn't be here if it hadn't been for the extinction of
the dinosaurs,'' said geologist Walter Alvarez of the University of
California at Berkeley. ``They were ruling the place. Mammals were
just running around underfoot until the impact killed the dinosaurs
and let us evolve.''
   Some researchers think the impact or impacts clouded the sky
with smoke, dust or debris that blocked out sunlight and wiped out
food supplies. Others have theorized, somewhat in jest, that
changes in vegetation upset the dinosaurs' diet, leaving them
fatally constipated.
   Other possible deadly effects of asteroids hitting Earth include
acid rain, giant tidal waves, dark freezing weather, global warming
by the greenhouse effect and a worldwide firestorm that broiled
creatures in their tracks.

<HEAD>White House Ornaments Offer a Presidential Twist to the Holidays</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   With Christmas around the corner, the White
House Historical Association's souvenir shop is doing a booming
business once again in Christmas ornaments with a presidential
twist.
   It was almost a decade ago that the non-profit group came up
with the idea of selling tourists the special Christmas keepsakes
alongside its standard postcards and guidebooks about presidents
and first ladies.
   The shiny ornaments proved a hit with tourists and natives
alike.
   Each year's ornament has outsold the last, and the association's
executive director, Bernard F. Meyer, confidently predicts ``we'll
sell in the neighborhood of 150,000 to 200,000'' of the newest one.
   The 1990 White House ornament is a colorful miniature of the
Blue Room as it looked at Yuletime when Martin Van Buren was
president 150 years ago.
   The association, which operates out of a townhouse on Jackson
Place across from the White House, sells the 24 karat gold-finished
ornaments for $11 - or $13 by mail.
   Meyer said he has heard reports of stores reselling the
ornaments for as much as $18.
   He shrugged off the black market markup, saying, ``There's
nothing we can do about it.''
   The association, which raises funds for acquiring art and
furnishings for the presidential mansion, now counts on the
Christmas ornament sales for two-thirds of its $2.5 million annual
operating budget.
   Not all of that is profit, but Meyer says the group clears
several hundred thousand dollars from the ornament sales to
subsidize other projects, including a forthcoming new book on White
House art and paintings.
   The association still sells the earlier ornaments from each
Christmas going back to 1981. In keeping with its mission, it
packages them with pamphlets recalling the history of early U.S.
presidents.
   Last year's ornament was a colorful presidential seal. Its
popularity was heightened by a production glitch that led to
temporary shortages and long lines outside the association's
townhouse.
   The ornaments also are sold at a booth inside the White House
along the route that more than 1 million visitors follow each year.
   Meyer said the association's volunteer board of directors has
turned down proposals for wider marketing of the Christmas
ornaments.
   ``Our organization is conservative,'' he said. ``We are not
connected with the White House, but we have the name. We don't want
to do anything that could create an embarrassment.''
   Word of mouth has proven sufficient to propel ornament sales
upward each year. And people who give a White House ornament once
to friends or relatives often find they are expected to produce the
new one the next Christmas.
   Meyer knows how that works. He says he has to buy 22 himself to
keep everyone on his gift list happy.

   The government has been trying for years, with
one spectacular failure along the way, to develop systems to retard
aircraft fires such as the one that swept a Northwest Airlines
jetliner this week.
   The hope at one time was that an anti-misting fuel additive
would prevent the vapors in jet fuel from igniting and exploding in
a crash.
   In on-the-ground stationary tests the additive appeared to work
and the Federal Aviation Administration was close to requiring
airlines to add it to jet fuel.
   But when the FAA deliberately crashed a remote-controlled Boeing
720 in the California desert six years ago to test the idea under
realistic conditions, the jetliner exploded in flame.
   Eleven months later, the FAA acknowledged: ``The concept is not
practical for day-to-day airline operation in the foreseeable
future.''
   The experiment was not repeated, and as Monday's runway
collision at Detroit's Metropolitan Airport shows, fire remains a
constant hazard in aviation accidents.
   The collision of two Northwest jetliners, a DC-9 and a Boeing
727, killed eight people aboard the DC-9 and left it a shredded and
fire-chared hulk.
   The eight apparently died from inhaling noxious fumes before
their bodies were burned beyond recognition, officials said.
   At least 20 other people were hospitalized with burns, broken
bones and smoke inhalation.
   Concern over aircraft fires was dramatized in 1977 when two
Boeing 747 jumbo jets collided on a foggy runway at Tenerife in the
Canary Islands, killing 581 people.
   In the years since the failure of the fuel-additive experiment
in 1984, the FAA and the Department of Transportation have
concentrated on trying to make the immediate surroundings of air
passengers more flame-resistant.
   FAA officials say the aim is to delay for an additional 60
seconds the spread of fire inside an aircraft cabin, thus providing
additional time to evacuate.
   A year after 23 people were killed in a 1983 smoky fire aboard
an Air Canada jetliner, the DOT ordered all aircraft with 30 or
more seats to install fire-blocking material in all passenger
seats.
   Floor-level lights were required to facilitate escape from an
aircraft cabin choked with smoke.
   In 1988, additional safety rules were imposed after an agreement
between the FAA and the aviation industry on more stringent
flammability standards for aircraft cabin walls, ceilings and
storage bins.
   Northwest said it could not immediately determine whether the
destroyed plane, the oldest version of the McDonnell Douglas DC-9,
was in full compliance with the FAA's fire safety rules.

<HEAD>Relaxation of Reserve Requirements Seen Aiding Banks, Not Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve's relaxation of reserve
requirements should help fatten the thin profits of large banks at
taxpayers' expense, but likely will not greatly stimulate the
economy in general, analysts say.
   The central bank said its unusual action, announced Tuesday, was
aimed in part at encouraging banks to lend to creditworthy
borrowers, easing a shortage of credit.
   But private economists said the most visible result of the first
change in reserve requirements since 1983 likely will be a modest
increase in bank earnings at a time of increasing strain on the
industry.
   ``This increases the profit margin to banks but does not
guarantee more loans,'' said economist Allen Sinai of The Boston
Co. ``It may or may not reduce interest rates.
   ``This is a surgical move to shore up the banking system because
there is a risk that the banking system could bring the economy
down more,'' Sinai said.
   Because of the types of reserves reduced, large banks likely
will benefit more than smaller banks, he said.
   Reserve requirements ensure that banks have the cash on hand to
meet depositor demands. Institutions must maintain the reserves
either as cash in the vault or in non-interest-bearing accounts
with the Fed.
   When the central bank requires fewer reserves, banks then have
more money to make profit-earning loans or other investments.
Consequently, the Fed's revenue is reduced because it has less
money to invest in government securities.
   ``As I understand it, this is a transfer of profits from the
Treasury to the banking sector,'' said economist Paul Getman of
Regional Financial Associates of West Chester, Pa. ``All of the
Fed's profits at the end of the year go to the Treasury.''
   The central bank turned over $21.6 billion in 1989, according to
a Fed official. The net effect of Tuesday's change, depending on
interest rates, will be to deprive taxpayers of roughly $600
million a year and to bolster bank profits by about the same
amount.
   ``That's a nice piece of change for the banking sector, but I
don't think it's going to do squat to get them to make more
loans,'' Getman said.
   He said banks aren't tightening credit because they lack money
to lend, but rather because of concerns about the ability of
borrowers to repay the loans during an economic downturn.
   Bert Ely, a financial institutions analyst in Alexandria, Va.,
said the reduced reserve requirement will only partly offset a more
than 60 percent increase next year in banks' deposit insurance
premiums.
   ``What the government taketh with one hand, it giveth back
partially with the other,'' he said.
   During the two weeks ending Nov. 28, institutions maintained $59
billion in reserves. Tuesday's change would reduce reserves by
about $13.6 billion, according to the Fed.
   The move Tuesday affects two types of reserves: those held
against non-personal time deposits with maturities of less than 18
months and net Eurocurrency liabilities.
   Non-personal time deposits primarily are certificates of deposit
purchased by businesses. Net Eurocurrency liabilities are the net
amounts that banks borrow from their overseas branches.
   The reserve requirement on those two types will drop from 3
percent to 1.5 percent beginning Dec. 13 and to zero beginning Dec.
27. No change was made in the requirement of a 12 percent reserve
for transaction accounts, primarily checking accounts.
   A change in the reserve requirements is the most rarely used of
the Fed's three monetary policy tools.
   The most common is the purchase or sale of government securities
to expand or contract the amount of cash available to banks. Those
sales directly affect the federal funds rate, the interest charged
among banks for overnight loans. The Fed has cut the funds rate -
now at 7{ percent - three times since July, each time by a
quarter-point.
   The next most common is a change in the discount rate - the
interest the Fed charges on direct loans to member banks. That was
last changed in February 1989, when it was raised from 6{ percent
to 7 percent.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal-state task force will review
corrosion and maintenance problems on the Alaska oil pipeline in an
effort to deter what one official calls a ``potential disaster.''
   The Transportation Department said Tuesday the task force will
assess operation, maintenance and safety of the 800-mile-long,
48-inch steel pipeline, which snakes from Prudhoe Bay to the marine
terminal at Valdez and carries a quarter of the nation's
domestically produced crude oil.
   The panel also will review environmental protection and
emergency response procedures.
   The formation of the task force was announced by Travis P.
Dugan, head of the department's Research and Special Programs
Administration.
   ``Twenty-five percent of this nation's domestic oil production
is transported through this pipeline,'' Dugan said. ``It's vital
that the safety and operational procedures used in this system are
of the highest caliber.
   ``We formed this task force to avoid potential disaster, which
could easily occur if the pipeline is neglected,'' he said. ``It is
our way of locking the barn door before the horse runs away.''
   The task force will include representatives of the
Transportation Department's Office of Pipeline Safety; the Pipeline
Monitoring Branch of the Bureau of Land Management, part of the
Interior Department; and the state of Alaska's Department of
Natural Resources and Office of Pipeline Monitoring.
   A report by the congressional General Accounting Office in May
said there has been no proper watch over the maintenance of the
13-year-old pipeline, leading to the possibility of an oil spill on
land equally as disastrous as the March 1989 ocean spill in Prince
William Sound.
   ``The pipeline has not received the systematic, comprehensive
oversight needed to ensure compliance with operational safety,
emergency response and environmental requirements,'' the report
concluded.
   GAO officials said at the time the situation was worrisome
because of reports of corrosion in the pipeline. They did note
recent improvement in federal and state checkups on pipeline
operations and said new efforts at coordination showed promise ``if
organized and staffed appropriately.''
   The pipeline is operated by Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., which
said last month it expects to spend $600 million to $800 million by
1993 on corrosion detection and repair.
   Alyeska said then it had already repaired 138 corroded sections
with steel sleeves.
   Alyeska is a consortium of subsidiaries of the Exxon, BP, ARCO,
Mobil, Unocal, Phillips and Amerada Hess oil companies.
   The pipeline carries nearly 2 million barrels of crude oil per
day. That is about one-eighth of all U.S. crude consumption because
the nation imports half its crude.

<HEAD>In Break With the Past, France Lets African Rebels Take Over</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE GANLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France signaled a dramatic shift in dealings with
its former African colonies by ordering French troops in Chad to
stand aside while rebels toppled a regime that Paris had backed
with guns and money since 1982.
   ``The time has passed when France could pick and choose the
governments in these countries, change them or maintain them as it
wished,'' said Foreign Minister Roland Dumas.
   Foreign Legionnaires had grandstand seats when Idriss Deby's
insurgents marched into Chad's capital, N'Djamena, on Sunday,
having chased President Hissene Habre across the Chari river to
Cameroon.
   In other African capitals, amidst other upheavals in the past,
French troops have helped prop up friendly regimes. Habre himself
received extensive French military support in countering Libyan
incursions in 1986-87.
   But this time, Habre got no help.
   ``We didn't aid Idriss Deby. We simply left him alone,'' said
the French development minister, Jacques Pelletier.
   As recently as June, France helped finance Habre's re-election
to the presidency. Billed as Chad's first free elections, only the
official party and independent candidates were allowed to run.
   But during that same month, President Francois Mitterrand
spelled out France's new attitude at a Franco-African summit. He
linked French aid to efforts at democratization and stressed that
his country's military muscle was not at the disposal of dictators
seeking to settle scores with domestic rivals.
   Habre was notably hostile to Mitterrand's pronouncements, saying
France must not impose Western ideological systems on nations
unable to sustain them.
   Some skeptics question whether France is prepared to exchange
its role of gendarme for spectator in all cases, arguing that
expediency dictates the African policies made in Paris.
   Jean-Pierre Magnant, a Chad specialist at Bordeaux University's
Institute for Political Studies, is among those unconvinced that
France will remain faithful to a new policy.
   ``It doesn't change the foundation of things, it changes the
form,'' Magnant said of Mitterrand's pronouncements. ``We support
the good dictators, and those that bother us, we let them go.''
   France acknowledges that Libya supplied Deby with 40 percent of
his arms but, in a departure from past policy, said this was not
grounds to contain his advances on Habre.
   Some French media have referred to massive Libyan arms
shipments, saying Paris conveniently chose to ignore what in the
past would have constituted an aggression by a foreign power.
   France, which currently has 1,800 troops in Chad, one of the
world's poorest nations, had backed Habre after he took power in a
1982 coup d'etat.
   Deby, 38, a master tactician trained at France's war college,
became Habre's military adviser. But he fled last year amid
allegations of a coup, taking refuge in Sudan.
   Deby, who began his final offensive Nov. 10, had implored the
French to remain neutral and, victory in hand, thanked them.
   France has expressed satisfaction with Deby's stated wish for
multiparty democracy in Chad. Like most former French colonies in
Africa, Chad has had only dictators of various types since gaining
independence three decades ago.
   Habre has slowly fallen from grace in Paris.
   Since the fall of Communist dictatorships in Eastern Europe,
several of Africa's strongmen have been forced to move to
multiparty systems.
   ``The shock of 1989 had lots of repercussions in Africa and,
especially, Francophone Africa, where bloody dictatorships were
everywhere,'' said Magnant. ``It is France which made the one-party
regimes.''
   Chad is the most dramatic, but not the first, example of recent
French neutrality in a conflict in Francophone Africa.
   In May, France reinforced its military presence in Gabon, where
demonstrations hostile to President Omar Bongo threatened the
security of French oil operations. But the French troops, there to
protect French citizens, avoided intervening in the violence.
   The same scenario was played out recently in Rwanda, where
French soldiers helped evacuate foreigners and guard the airport,
but engaged in no major fighting against a rebel army.
   Besides Chad and Gabon, France maintains troops in the Ivory
Coast, Senegal, the Central African Republic and Djibouti, an
important French naval base.
   The Paris newspaper Liberation said Africa is no longer a top
priority for France. With the ongoing changes in Europe and the
Persian Gulf crisis, Chad is but a poor man's war, the paper said.
   Other African despots must now take note that France is no
longer their ``life insurance policy,'' Liberation wrote.

<HEAD>Nonsmokers Regularly Exposed to High Levels of Cigarette Smoke</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Should stand</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   A new study found 91 percent of nonsmokers
were regularly exposed to high levels of cigarette smoke,
suggesting that the Environmental Protection Agency has
underestimated the risk of passive smoking, a researcher says.
   Dr. Michael Cummings of the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in
Buffalo, N.Y., also said childhood exposure to parents' cigarette
smoke could be a greater risk than an adult nonsmoker's exposure to
a spouse's or colleague's smoke.
   If that is correct, lung cancer could be about to increase among
nonsmokers of the baby boom generation, a result of their parents'
widespread adoption of smoking after World War II, Cummings said.
   He presented his findings Tuesday at a meeting of an EPA panel
considering the merits of the agency's draft passive smoking study
that concludes that cigarette smoke is a known cause of cancer in
nonsmokers.
   The panel has been criticized by anti-smoking groups after news
reports disclosed that six of its 16 members had ties to a tobacco
industry research organization.
   Questions of potential conflict of interest arose again Tuesday.
During a voluntary disclosure of possible conflicts, three panel
members did not disclose that their institutions had received
tobacco industry grants.
   Morton Lippmann, the panel's chairman, did not mention that
three researchers in his department at New York University were
receiving a total of $578,000 from the Center for Indoor Air
Research of Linthicum, Md., which is financed and operated by the
tobacco industry.
   Lippmann declined to be interviewed Tuesday.
   Two other panel members failed to disclose tobacco industry
research grants to their institutions.
   Geoffrey Kabat did not mention that his employer, the American
Health Foundation of New York, is receiving a $109,000 grant this
year from the Center for Indoor Air Research.
   Kabat also declined comment.
   A third panel member, Jan Stolwijk of Yale University, said his
department several years ago received a grant of $250,000 from the
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.
   ``I had nothing to do with it,'' he said. ``As a matter of fact,
I was not happy about it.''
   The EPA panel, which was meeting again today at an Arlington
hotel, is considering two draft EPA reports. One concludes that
cigarette smoke causes 3,700 lung cancer cases per year in
nonsmokers and should be designated a class A carcinogen - a known
cause of human cancer.
   The other report is a guide to aid the development of workplace
smoking policies.
   As the meeting opened Tuesday, Rep. Chet Atkins, D-Mass., and 10
other congressmen wrote a letter to EPA Administrator William
Reilly asking that panel members be required ``to sever their ties
to the tobacco industry.''
   They said EPA's rule ``prohibits officials from participating in
decisions that `directly and predictably affect the financial
interest' of an industry in which they have an employment or
financial stake.''
   David Ryan, an EPA spokesman, said the agency had no comment on
the letter.
   The Cummings study measured levels of cotinine, a nicotine
breakdown product, in the urine of 669 nonsmokers. He found that 91
percent had detectable levels.
   ``That means they had been exposed, probably in the past week,
to tobacco smoke,'' he said.
   When this hitherto unsuspected high background exposure to smoke
is taken into account, studies suggest that women married to
smokers may have more than double the risk of lung cancer than do
women married to nonsmokers.
   The EPA, which did not take the background exposure into
account, concluded that wives of smokers have a 28 percent increase
in lung cancer risk, compared to wives of nonsmokers.
   J. Donald deBethizy of the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco said small
amounts of nicotine found in some foods could be producing some of
the cotinine Cummings measured, but others disagreed.
   ``We don't find any evidence that dietary intake is related to
cotinine,'' said Joellen Lewtas, manager of the EPA's environmental
tobacco smoke research program.
   Robert Flaak, the EPA official conducting the panel meeting,
said he was not concerned that the panel members had failed to
disclose the tobacco grants to their institutions.
   ``The fact that they left something out is not malicious, I
don't think,'' he said. ``The disclosure process is a voluntary
one.''
   In materials sent to the panel, Flaak had written that the
issues that might be perceived as conflicts of interest include
``the extent to which you or your organization have received ...
professional or personal benefits from any individuals,
organizations or groups representing any viewpoint concerning the
issues under consideration at this meeting.''

<TEXT>
   Backers of Republican Fife Symington were
rebuffed by the Arizona Supreme Court in their bid to have him
declared governor outright without having to compete in a runoff
Feb. 26.
   Symington and his Democratic opponent, Terry Goddard, praised
the court's decision Tuesday and said they looked forward to the
runoff.
   The legal tangle began when Symington outpolled Goddard by about
4,000 votes in November's election but did not get the required
majority to succeed Democratic Gov. Rose Mofford, who did not run
this year.
   Symington supporters, acting without his approval, went to court
to argue that the constitutional amendment requiring the runoff was
invalid because rules on how to implement it had not been passed by
lawmakers before the election.
   The court ruled against the Symington supporters three hours
after hearing arguments. ``The Legislature does not have the power
to eliminate by inaction this constitutional requirement,'' Chief
Justice Frank Gordon Jr. wrote.
   Symington supporters said they would decide in a day or two
whether to go to federal court.
   Symington, after initial hesitation, had come out against the
lawsuit, saying he didn't think avoiding a runoff would sit well
with voters.

<TEXT>
   A 24-year-old Maryland man has been
arrested in connection with the shooting death of the younger
brother of Len Bias, a University of Maryland basketball star who
died of a cocaine overdose.
   Prince George's County police have charged Jerry Samuel Tyler of
Temple Hills with first-degree murder in the death of James Stanley
Bias III, 20, also known as Jay.
   Tyler turned himself in Tuesday night, said Lt. Alphonso
Hawkins. A second suspect remained at large.
   Bias was shot about 1:10 p.m. Tuesday in the parking lot of the
Prince George's Plaza Shopping Center in the Washington suburb of
Hyattsville, Md., police said.
   The cocaine overdose death of Len Bias shocked the sports world
through its illustration of the extent of drug use among athletes.
Len Bias died just two days after his first-round selection by the
Boston Celtics in the National Basketball Association draft.
   Tuesday's shooting apparently resulted from an argument that
began in a jewelry store, Cpl. Mark Polk said.
   Jay Bias and two friends were shopping when they were confronted
by a man who accused Bias of flirting with his girlfriend, the
store's clerk, police said.
   ``He was confronted by a black male suspect. They got into an
argument. There was an exchange of words,'' Polk said. ``The
suspect asked Mr. Bias to come out to the parking lot and they
would take care of business there. Mr. Bias declined.''
   The man left, but Bias remained inside for a short time. He left
after making a purchase, police said.
   He was shot as he and his friends were driving away from the
shopping center, police said.

<HEAD>Justice Urges Court to Duck Iraq War Powers Issue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department says the courts have no
role in political discussions between President Bush and Congress
over whether to go to war in the Mideast.
   Arguing that it was a matter for the ``political branches'' of
government, Congress and the White House, Assistant Attorney
General Stuart M. Gerson asked Tuesday for dismissal of a lawsuit
by 54 Democratic members of Congress that seeks an injunction
requiring Bush to seek congressional approval before attacking
Iraqi forces.
   Lawyers for the plaintiffs argued that the court should tell the
president not be ``snubbing his nose'' at Congress.
   Gerson told U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene that an
injunction is unnecessary because ``there has been no decision, one
way or another, to deploy forces'' against Iraq.
   ``It may well be that Iraq will come to its senses, it may very
well be for the Congress to endorse the United Nations resolution''
passed last week by the Security Council authorizing force to expel
Iraqi troops from Kuwait after Jan. 15, Gerson said. ``At this
point, it's a matter to be worked out by the political branches.''
   Gerson argued that granting the injunction ``would put this
court directly in the way of defining what a war is - itself
becoming commander-in-chief,'' Gerson said.
   The plaintiffs contend that the war-powers clause of the
Constitution requires a declaration of war or some other
authorization by Congress before the president may launch U.S.
forces.
   ``I think the president is snubbing his nose at Congress and I
think the court should say he cannot continue to do so,''
University of Pittsburgh law professor Jules Lobel argued for the
lawmakers. ``This suit is not about whether we ought to go to war,
but who ought to make that decision.''
   But Greene expressed skepticism about Lobel's argument, noting
that the Bush administration views the war powers clause as a
process for ``the two political branches to agree when there is a
war.
   ``It doesn't have to involve the judiciary,'' Greene said. ``You
also have a problem to overcome in that no court has ever issued an
injunction you are asking for.''
   Presidents have ordered armed forces to engage in hostilities
more than 200 times since the founding of the republic. Congress
has issued only five declarations of war, though it sometimes has
approved of presidential action through other resolutions.
   The Constitution says ``The Congress shall have power ... to
declare war'' and also ``The president shall be commander in
chief'' of the armed forces.

<TEXT>
   Westerners hiding from the Iraqi
army in Kuwait, growing desperate, are thinking of surrendering
before Christmas just to have contact with their families, a
recently arrived Kuwaiti refugee says.
   Dr. Abdullah Al-Shayeji, a 32-year-old economics professor at
Kuwait University, said Tuesday that Kuwaitis were still risking
their lives to get food, water and medicine to mostly British and
American men hiding from the Iraqis.
   He said Iraq was not mounting active patrols to look for them,
but moved quickly when informants told them where Westerners might
be hiding.
   Iraq has promised to execute anyone hiding a Westerner in
Kuwait.
   Foreigners who are caught are transported to Iraq, where they
are deployed as human shields at strategic targets around the
country to try to deter an attack by Western forces. About 600
Americans, British and Japanese are held at such sites.
   Up to 2,000 British and American men are still believed hiding
in Kuwait.
   Americans and Britons told Al-Shayeji that many are considering
giving themselves up just to talk to their wives and other loved
ones at Christmas, said the professor.
   He said he had been in regular contact with four Americans and
also spoke to the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait.
   Al-Shayeji said that before he drove to Saudi Arabia on Nov. 29,
two hostages told him to contact their families and tell them they
were on the verge of turning themselves in.
   He said they want the U.S. government to take action against
Iraq: ``They are wiped out mentally, physically, morale is down.
They are basket cases, every one of them.''
   Since the Kuwaitis help the Westerners avoid Iraqi patrols, find
them empty houses to live in and get them food, the foreigners are
in increasing danger as more Kuwaitis flee the country.
   The Kuwait information office in Saudi Arabia says 200 Kuwaitis
have crossed the border into Saudi Arabia daily since early
October, and just 200,000 of the original population of 570,000
native Kuwaitis remain behind.
   Al-Shayeji said the Iraqi forces had been especially vigilant at
the university while they systematically stripped Kuwait of
everything of value.
   ``It has been wiped out. Period. Everything that could be moved
was moved,'' said the professor, who was an undergraduate at
Oklahoma State University and received his doctorate at the
University of Texas.
   The five campuses of Kuwait University, which once held 18,000
students, are no longer functioning, and neither are the country's
600 schools, meaning there will be no 1990-91 academic year for any
students who stay in Kuwait, the professor said.

<TEXT>
   Development of the Navy's $48.7 billion
Seawolf attack submarine should be slowed until technical and
financial problems are solved, says a House committee report
released today.
   The vessel is ``perhaps the most conspicuous and potentially
most costly example of a program struggling with the problems of
adapting state-of-the-art computer technology into a
multi-billion-dollar weapons platform,'' says the Government
Operations Committee report.
   It recommends that Congress limit funding for construction of
additional Seawolf submarines until the Pentagon clarifies the
program's mission and provides assurances that the computer
problems will be fixed.
   Spokesman Lt. Greg Smith said the Navy would have no immediate
comment.
   Pentagon plans call for building 29 of the ships for $48.7
billion, with the first scheduled for completion in 1995 at an
estimated cost of $1.9 billion. It is billed as the largest,
quietest and most heavily armed nuclear attack submarines.

<HEAD>Mammograms Improving, FDA Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ability of mammograms to detect breast
cancer early has improved significantly since 1985, says the Food
and Drug Administration.
   The agency said Tuesday that greater radiation now being used is
justified by the improved quality of images, is still within FDA
safety guidelines and is about two-thirds lower than 1979 levels.
   FDA surveys of mammography equipment in 1985 showed that 36
produced substandard images. A survey by the agency in 1988 found
the rate had declined to 13 percent.
   ``I hope the surveys will encourage women to make greater use of
mammography,'' said Dr. James Mason, assistant secretary for health
at the Department of Health and Human Services. ``Early detection
and treatment offer women their best chance of surviving breast
cancer.''
   The National Cancer Institute recommends that women over 40 have
regular mammograms.
   A report on the FDA's surveys was published in the November
issue of the journal Radiology, the agency said.

<HEAD>INS Releases 75; Many in California</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service
says it has released 75 Salvadorans from custody in anticipation of
a new form of legal residence for them.
   The 75 were those who may qualify for so-called ``Temporary
Protected Status'' under the new immigration law signed last week
by President Bush.
   This provision was established for Salvadorans illegally in this
country who fear returning to their war-torn homeland but
nonetheless do not qualify for regular refugee status.
   To be admitted to legal residence as a refugee, an immigrant
must demonstrate a ``well-founded fear of persecution'' at home.
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service in the past has
contended that most Salvadorans who enter the United States
illegally could not qualify as refugees.
   The new law permits those Salvadorans in the United States
before Sept. 19 and here continuously since then to apply for
``Temporary Protected Status'' as of Jan. 2, permitting them to
work legally and banning their deportation.
   The law contains provision for eventual extension to citizens of
other nations. ``Temporary Protected Status'' is to last only 18
months from Jan. 1.
   An INS statement Tuesday quoted the head of the service, Gene
McNary, as saying, ``In keeping with the humanitarian spirit of the
Temporary Protected Status program,'' the service was releasing
Salvadorans in custody who could qualify.

   The dollar fell against the Japanese yen Wednesday,
while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange bounced back
moderately.
   The dollar closed at 133.42 yen, down 0.93 yen from Tuesday's
close of 134.35 yen. It opened at 133.35 yen, and ranged between
133.02 and 133.67 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 331.11
points, or 1.51 percent, closing at 22,193.72. The index had shed
863.38 points on Tuesday.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds rose to 87.22 points, up from Tuesday's
86.65 point finish. Their yield fell to 7.225 percent from 7.350
percent.
   Currency traders said the dollar's slide followed its drop in
New York on Tuesday, triggered by the U.S. Federal Reserve's
decision to ease its grip on interest rates and a news report that
Iraq may be ready to withdraw from most of Kuwait.
   Lower interest rates tend to erode the value of a currency.
   Akihiko Kagawa, a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, said weak
sentiment for the dollar was carried over in early Tokyo trading,
but the currency traded in a narrow range after news about Iraq was
considered.
   Sky television, a British television station, reported Tuesday
that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was considering a possible
withdrawal from Kuwait provided it be allowed to keep the disputed
Kuwaiti portion of the border-straddling Rumailah oil field.
   U.S. and British officials could not confirm the report.
   On the stock exchange, the Nikkei index started higher almost
across the board with an expectation that the Persian Gulf
situation may make a favorable turn with the reported Iraqi move,
securities dealers said.
   Dealers said the yen's appreciation and higher bond prices also
helped trading, though the index lost as many as 235 points at one
point following a round of buying.

<TEXT>
   American John Hull, sought in
neighboring Costa Rica in connection with a 1984 news conference
bombing that killed three journalists, has been living in Nicaragua
since October, a newspaper reports.
   Barricada, the official daily of the leftist Sandinista National
Liberation Front, said in Tuesday's editions that Hull is living
with his daughter in the southeastern town of Juigalpa.
   The paper said Hull was reported to be trying to set up a
business with former Contra rebel leaders.
   Nicaraguan presidential spokesman Daniel Lacayo said he was
unaware of Hull's whereabouts, but said he would look into the
reports that the American has allegedly been living in the country.
   Hull, 71, who arrived in Costa Rica in the 1960s, owned a farm
and landing strip near the Nicaraguan border that was used to
supply American-backed Contra rebels fighting the Sandinistas in
Nicaragua.
   Hull, who holds dual citizenship in the United States and Costa
Rica, was an enthusiastic supporter of the Contra cause. He was
arrested in Costa Rica, but skipped bond in July and fled to the
United States.
   In Costa Rica, Hull has been implicated in the May 1984
assassination attempt on Nicaraguan rebel leader Eden Pastora
during a news conference.
   In the incident, a bomb carried into Pastora's jungle
headquarters at La Penca wounded Pastora and about a dozen
reporters and killed American reporter Linda Frazier and two Costa
Rican journalists.
   Hull is one of 29 people named in a civil suit filed in the
United States in relation to the bombing.

   The picture had no particular scientific
value, but astronomers were still ``hopping up and down'' with
excitement over the first photo taken by whtt will soon be the
world's most powerful optical telescope.
   Scientists said the $94.2 million Keck Telescope at Mauna Kea,
Hawaii, will peer deeper into space than ever before and yield
clues to the creation of the universe.
   Astronomers on Tuesday displayed Keck's first picture, which was
taken with only a quarter of the telescope's 36 mirror segments in
place. When completed it will be the world's largest telescope with
a mirror 10 meters in diameter.
   The photo of a galaxy 65 million light years from Earth more
than matched the quality of images from the world's largest
effective telescope, the 5-meter Hale Telescope at Mount Palomar
Observatory. It was taken Nov. 24.
   ``When we first saw the picture we were really thrilled,'' said
mirror designer Jerry Nelson, an astronomer at the University of
California, Berkeley. ``We were all hopping up and down.''
   The photograph had no particular scientific value, Nelson said.
He said the galaxy NGC 1232 was selected simply to demonstrate the
quality of the telescope, which will be fully functioning late next
year.
   Astronomers said the Keck will allow them to gaze back 12
billion years in time by revealing light images still traveling
toward Earth.
   They will be able to see stars as they appeared some 3 billion
years after the birth of the universe. Palomar, by contrast,
reaches back 8 billion years.
   ``How did the Big Bang lead to the structure of the universe?''
asked William Frazer, vice chairman of the California Association
of Research in Astronomy. ``To understand that we've got to look
closer to when the galaxies first formed. This will enable us to
get closer.''
   The Keck telescope is the first to be built of automated mirror
segments. It differs from other large telescopes in that its mirror
is composed of separate hexagonal segments 6 feet in diameter. The
aluminum-coated mirrors are kept in alignment within one-millionth
of an inch by computer-controlled sensors.
   The Keck will offer research opportunities not possible with the
$1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope, which was supposed to see
farther into the universe than the Keck but has a mirror flaw that
renders it less powerful.
   NASA won't be able to fix the orbiting Hubble until 1993.
   The California Institute of Technology and the University of
California are sharing the cost of the Keck.

   CNN got the scoop on Manuel Noriega's taped phone
calls but no longer has an exclusive on the story.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler ruled Tuesday that
transcripts of the tapes will be made public Thursday unless CNN
appeals.
   He ruled in favor of four news organizations that had argued the
transcripts were part of the public record and that the public had
a right to know the facts behind a case that had tested the limits
of freedom of the press.
   CNN had sought to retain exclusive use of the tapes, accusing
the other news organizations of trying to steal their story.
   ``The content never was and never will be CNN's,'' said Sanford
Bohrer, an attorney for the four news organizations: The Miami
Herald, The Associated Press, Post-Newsweek station WPLG-TV of
Miami and Gannett Co. and its USA Today.
   CNN attorney Terry Bienstock said the network had not decided
whether to appeal.
   He said the judge broke new ground by deciding that material
used in closed court hearings could be made public.
   ``To the extent it benefits all media, CNN's pleased about
that,'' Bienstock said. ``But we still see this as a continued
breach of the news-gathering process, by allowing access to
information gathered under a promise of confidentiality.''
   CNN has broadcast some of the seven tapes and argued that the
recordings, and therefore the transcripts, were its property. The
network said the transcripts should be burned or returned to CNN.
   Hoeveler disagreed, saying CNN ``did not interview Noriega to
obtain the conversations, nor did it record the conversations.''
   The tapes contain conversations between the deposed Panamanian
dictator, who awaits trial on drug-trafficking charges, and his
defense team. His lawyers accuse the government of leaking the
recordings made by prison authorities.
   After CNN aired one of the tapes last month, Noriega attorney
Frank Rubino argued that the recordings violate Noriega's
attorney-client privilege, and Hoeveler on Nov. 8 barred the
network from further such broadcasts.
   But CNN aired a tape anyway the next day, saying the First
Amendment forbids prior restraint of the media.
   CNN stopped the telecasts after a federal appeals court upheld
the judge's ruling. The U.S. Supreme Court, on a 7-2 vote, refused
to intervene.
   CNN then submitted the tapes to Hoeveler, who had the
transcripts made. After all sides examined them in secret, the
judge found the tapes did not prejudice Noriega's defense and said
the network could air them.
   Noriega is awaiting trial on charges of taking $4.6 million in
payoffs to protect the cocaine trade.

<HEAD>`Canned' Quake Forecasts to Help Warn When the `Big One' May Be

   Scientists have computed a table of quake
odds that will help emergency officials in Southern California warn
the public quickly that the Big One may be imminent.
   The U.S. Geological Survey scientists figured out the chances
that a moderate jolt along the San Andreas Fault will be followed
by a catastrophic quake. It computed those odds for jolts of
different sizes and locations.
   When a moderate jolt does occur, the scientists will consult
their canned forecasts and will warn state officials if the odds of
a catastrophic quake striking within the following three days fall
between 5 percent and 25 percent.
   Armed with such a warning, state officials can tell the public
and get emergency equipment in place, said scientists who unveiled
the quake-prediction system Tuesday at a meeting of the American
Geophysical Union.
   ``The idea is to let people know when the possibility exists of
a larger earthquake on the next several days,'' said Jim Davis,
California's state geologist.
   Last month, the state announced the nation's first detailed plan
for issuing warnings that there is a strong chance an earthquake
will strike within days.
   Under that plan, state officials can close schools, prepare
emergency equipment and urge people to stay at home until the
danger has passed.
   A 1988 Geological Survey report said the Big One is at least 60
percent likely within 30 years somewhere along the southern San
Andreas Fault, which runs past Los Angeles.
   A 1980 Federal Emergency Management Agency report said such a
quake could kill up to 14,000 people, hospitalize 55,000 and cause
up to $17 billion in damage.

   The dollar fell back against the yen today after
rising for four consecutive trading days, while share prices
rebounded moderately.
   The dollar closed at 133.42 yen, down 0.93 yen from Tuesday's
close of 134.35 yen. It opened at 133.35 yen and ranged between
133.02 and 133.67 yen. It had gained 5.45 yen in the previous four
trading days.
   About $9.94 billion changed hands in today's spot trading,
compared with $12.73 billion Tuesday.
   Traders said the dollar recovered somewhat from its low start
after U.S. and British officials said they could not confirm a news
report that Iraq might be ready to withdraw from most of Kuwait.
War fears tend to encourage buying of the dollar, seen as a safe
haven in times of trouble.
   Sky Television, a British station, reported Tuesday that Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein was considering a possible withdrawal from
Kuwait provided Iraq were allowed to keep the Rumailah oil field.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which had shed
863.38 points on Tuesday, climbed 331.11 points, or 1.51 percent,
closing at 22,193.72. A total of 350 million shares were traded on
the first section, up from 250 million the previous day.
   Shares first rose broadly after the report on Iraq indicated the
Persian Gulf situation might take a favorable turn, securities
dealers said.
   The yen's rise and higher bond prices also encouraged stock
purchases, although the index lost as many as 235 points at one
point following a round of buying, they said.
   ``But a wait-and-see mood basically remains in the market,''
partly because of uncertainties about the gulf crisis, said Takashi
Morinaga of Okasan Securities.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds rose to 87.22 as of 5 p.m. (3 a.m. EST)
from Tuesday's close of 86.65. Their yield fell to 7.225 percent
from 7.350 percent.

   The 1989 best new artist Grammy that was
taken away from the lip-syncing front men of Milli Vanilli will not
be given to another act.
   The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences decided than
when an award is withdrawn, ``the category will remain vacant,''
academy president Michael Greene said Tuesday.
   ``There is one winner. There is no first runner-up. We either
have a winner or we give no award,'' Greene said in a statement.
   In addition, Milli Vanilli's three entries in the 1990 awards
were declared ineligible.
   However, their single ``Blame It On The Rain,'' written by Diane
Warren, remains eligible in the 1990 Song of the Year category
because the award is for songwriting.
   The academy stripped Rob Pilatus and Fabrice Morvan of their
Grammy on Nov. 19 after it was learned that they hadn't sung a note
on their album.
   The group's first and only album, ``Girl You Know It's True,''
sold 7 million copies and made the two unknowns international
stars.

<HEAD>Afternoon Edition Hits Streets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Daily News, fighting to bring back
advertisers and regain circulation lost in a 6-week-old strike, has
launched its first afternoon edition in nine years.
   Street hawkers Tuesday distributed 30,000 copies of the initial
press run. The tabloid had blue ink printed across the top and
bottom of the front page to distinguish it from morning editions.
   ``We have been champing at the bit to be innovative and try to
do things when we think it's practical to do so,'' said News
Publisher James Hoge.
   Theodore Kheel, an adviser to the unions, called the new edition
``an act of desperation ... doomed to failure.''
   Using management, replacement workers and employees who crossed
the picket line, the News has published every day during the
strike. But its pre-strike circulation - the nation's third highest
at 1.09 million - has dropped by more than half.
   The circulation drop has cost the paper many major advertisers.
The News said it expects to lose up to $35 million this quarter and
about $85 million for the year. That's on top of losses of $115
million from 1979 through 1989.
   In 1981, the Daily News ceased publication of an afternoon
edition called Daily News Tonight. That paper lasted a year.
   The News' parent, the Tribune Co. of Chicago, committed $20
million to that venture, but Daily News Tonight attracted only
about 70,000 readers compared with a hoped-for 200,000.
   The New York Post was New York's last afternoon paper when it
closed down its afternoon edition in 1988. It started a morning
edition in 1980 in an attempt to boost circulation and cut costs.

<HEAD>Puerto Rican Leaders Fault Police Handling of Riot</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TRACY FIELDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Puerto Rican leaders say it took a riot to draw
attention to their impoverished community's problems.
   ``My community has the same problems, especially in the poorer
neighborhoods, as the black community. We've been completely
ignored,'' Emilio Lopez said one day after hundreds rampaged in the
city's Wynwood section.
   The five-hour riot erupted Monday after six police officers were
acquitted of conspiracy in the beating death of a reputed drug
dealer from the neighborhood. Stores were looted and burned. Fire
damage alone was put at $2.9 million.
   Business owners Tuesday said police were too slow to move in and
save their shops.
   ``The Miami police sacrificed us,'' said Patrick Gerrits, owner
of a contracting firm that fell victim to the looting and
vandalism.
   Only three mismatched shoes remained at a shoe store operated by
Ricardo Perez's family. ``I saw people on television running with
boxes and boxes of our shoes,'' he said. ``The police stood half a
block away and didn't lift a finger.''
   Police Chief Perry Anderson admitted that the riot squad, which
waited two hours before moving in, was slow to react. Nevertheless,
he defended their caution, pointing out that there were no deaths
or serious injuries.
   ``We live in a very volatile city, a powder-keg city,'' he said.
``You're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't.''
   About 15 arrests were made.
   It was the fifth major racial uprising in Miami in little more
than a decade. Previously, the riots affected primarily black
neighborhoods.
   ``There seems to be an invisible government, where the voices of
minorities, unless they peak in violence, are not heard,'' said
Betzaida Ferrer, state director of the national Puerto Rican
Foundation.
   Emilio Lopez said inadequate education, health care and social
services, a lack of jobs and tense relations with police plague the
community and make disturbances more likely.
   The jury on Monday cleared the officers of conspiracy in the
beating death of Leonardo Mercado two years ago and deadlocked on
more serious civil rights charges. The judge declared a mistrial on
those charges.
   Community leaders met Tuesday night and called for a renewed
investigation of the slaying. They also demanded a retrial on the
deadlocked charges and better communication with local government.
   ``We are getting a lot of attention now, but I don't want within
48 hours everything to be forgotten,'' said Ivette Morgan, a Puerto
Rican member of the Community Relations Board.

<HEAD>Social Democrats In Crisis, Lafontaine Declines Party Leadership</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The main opposition Social Democrats are in
the throes of their worst crisis in years after standard-bearer
Oskar Lafontaine failed to unseat Chancellor Helmut Kohl, then
turned down the party chairmanship.
   The left-leaning Social Democrats are a party without a
platform. They are crippled by internal divisions and desperately
seeking a new leader of the caliber of senior party member Willy
Brandt, the former chancellor.
   Lafontaine said Tuesday that he is too busy as governor of
Saarland state to assume the chairmanship.
   But he also complained about the half-hearted support his
campaign received among some Social Democrats before Sunday's
election.
   ``It is impossible to conduct an election campaign without
solidarity,'' Lafontaine said Tuesday..
   Lafontaine refused to fully embrace German unity during the
campaign.
   The resulting damage was especially severe in what had been East
Germany, where the party captured just 25 percent of the vote.
Social Democrats are now viewed by many there as political pariahs.
   Lafontaine, 47, spent most of his campaign warning against the
pitfalls of unification, rather than proposing how unity's problems
- like high unemployment in the eastern lands - can be solved.
   ``The SPD should wholeheartedly say that unification is a
positive development,'' said Renate Koecher, a researcher at the
Allensbach polling institute.
   ``Secondly, they should see the new German states (East Germany)
as new turf where they have to be intensively engaged.''
   The party lost a half-million votes to Kohl's Christian
Democrats in the opposition party's worst electoral showing since
1957. It was the Social Democrats' third defeat by Kohl since he
came to power eight years ago.
   Kohl's grasp on Germany's leadership is already being compared
to that of Konrad Adenauer, West Germany's first chancellor, who
held office for 14 years.
   ``It really is now a fairly unbalanced political system, with a
very strong predominance of the government parties,'' said Peter
Pulzer, an Oxford University Germany specialist who observed the
elections.
   The governing parties, led by the Christian Democrats, also
include the Christian Social Union and Free Democrats.
   It took Brandt finally to dislodge Adenauer's Christian
Democrats in 1969. The Social Democrats are now hunting for a
leader who can do the same to Kohl.
   Brandt, 76, is the Social Democrats' most popular member and is
respected throughout the party.
   ``The party leadership needs rejuvenation,'' said national
chairman Hans-Jochen Vogel, who on Tuesday announced plans to step
down.
   Possible candidates for the top party job include Johannes Rau,
Walter Momper and Bjoern Engholm.
   Rau, 59, is the popular governor of North Rhine-Westphalia, but
he lost heavily to Kohl in the 1987 chancellor race.
   Momper, the 45-year-old former mayor of Berlin, had been seen as
a rising star within the Social Democrats' ranks, but he lost in
Berlin city elections on Sunday.
   Engholm, the 51-year-old governor of Schleswig-Holstein state,
is a dapper, pipe-smoking intellectual popular in his home state.
   One of the Social Democrats' best orators - 47-year-old Herta
Daeubler-Gmelin - has also been mentioned for the job.

<HEAD>Two White Men Found Innocent in Racial Murder of Black New York
Youth</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two white men were acquitted of murdering a
black teen-ager in a mob attack in Brooklyn's Bensonhurst section
that heightened racial tension in the city.
   A jury took four hours Tuesday to find Joseph Serrano and James
Patino innocent in the 1989 slaying of Yusuf Hawkins, a 16-year-old
shot to death after he and three friends went to the white
neighborhood to look at a used car.
   The blacks were set upon by a mob of up to 30 people wielding
baseball bats.
   Another defendant, Joseph Fama, has been convicted of murder in
the slaying. John Vento, whose first murder trial ended in a hung
jury, went on trial again Tuesday. Several other defendants face
trial next year.
   The attack heightened racial tensions during the mayoral contest
between David Dinkins and Rudolph Giuliani. Dinkins went on to
become New York's first black mayor.
   Serrano, 21, and Patino, 25, smiled broadly and embraced as the
verdict clearing them of murder, riot and other charges was
announced.
   ``I'm sorry for what happened to Yusuf Hawkins, but I had
nothing to with it. I was confident, I was secure in my
innocence,'' Serrano said.
   Serrano was convicted of a weapons offense punishable by up to a
year in prison. Sentencing was set for Jan. 11.
   None of Hawkins' family was in court for the verdict, but the
Rev. Al Sharpton, a family adviser, complained about the verdict.
   ``The first defendants are convicted, but when they get to the
bottom of the list, the community pressure is no longer there,'' he
said. ``Maybe we just have to stay on the system all the time.''
   Fama, who shot Hawkins, is serving 32 and two-thirds years to
life in prison.
   Keith Mondello, the mob's alleged ringleader, was acquitted of
murder but convicted of lesser crimes and drew five and one-third
years to 16 years.

<HEAD>Members of Maryland's Founding Family Believed Unearthed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. MARY'S CITY, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archaeologists have unearthed what
they believe is the crypt of members of Maryland's founding family,
the Calverts, from beneath the ruins of a 323-year-old Catholic
chapel.
   The find was described as one of the most significant
discoveries in Maryland history.
   Wielding a gold-colored trowel, Gov. William Donald Schaefer
ceremoniously scrapped the last bit of earth Tuesday from the
largest of three coffins hoisted from the ground.
   The casket is believed to be the final resting place of Philip
Calvert, the former British colony's first chancellor, who died in
1682.
   ``He is the one man who died in Maryland, of sufficient wealth
and stature and a Catholic, to be buried in the church, and in a
lead coffin,'' said Henry Miller, chief archaeologist on the dig.
   The two smaller caskets may contain the remains of two grandsons
of Cecil Calvert, who was Philip's half-brother and the first Lord
Baltimore, archaeologists said.
   ``In terms of religious and political significance, it ranks
extremely high,'' state archivist Edward Papenfuse said of the
find. ``It's probably as important as any Maryland site so far.''
   Miller said experts will be consulted on whether to open the
caskets.
   Maryland was founded in 1634 in St. Mary's City, at the state's
southern tip.

   Lockheed Corp. says its YF-22 advanced
tactical fighter successfully fired a Sidewinder missile in the
first such launch in the high-stakes competition for the Pentagon
contract to build the plane.
   The plane passed the test of whether the missile would scorch
the fuselage or affect the jet's handling, Lockheed spokesman
Richard Stadler said Tuesday.
   A team led by Lockheed and one by Northrop Corp. are in a
winner-take-all competition for the $63 billion contract for the
ATF, the replacement for the F-15 and the first U.S. fighter to
carry missiles entirely inside its fuselage.
   The Pentagon has said it hopes to buy the first of 750 planes
for the Air Force in 1996. The Navy has indicated it may want about
500 similar planes.
   Lockheed's version is more compact than Northrop's, the YF-23.
   The launch at the remote China Lake Naval Weapons Station last
week had ``zero effect'' in the two critical areas, Stadler said.
   Like Lockheed, Northrop has produced two prototypes, which are
being tested in a variety of areas such as wind drag, handling and
engine performance.
   So far, the government has given each team about $750 million to
develop their versions of the ATF, and each team has invested more
than that in its own money since the program began in 1986.

   Herrera told reporters at police headquarters that he was

   He said members of the police ``felt humiliated and wanted me to

   He did not elaborate on the alleged discontent among members of

   There were no reports of injuries in Hererra's escape Tuesday
afternoon from prison on the Pacific island of Nao aboard a private

   A U.S. Army officer met with Hererra early today, but there was
no indication as to what they discussed.
   Hererra said he also met with Panamanian officials to present
them with complaints of officers.

   Endara said Tuesday night that Herrera had tried unsuccessfully
to seize a police station in the Panama City neighborhood of San
Miguelito.
   ``He called several provinces and we know he failed absolutely.
He called over the National Police radio network and he got no
response,'' Endara told a news conference.
   Reporters saw a heavy deployment of security men at the
presidential palace Tuesday afternoon and evening.
   Herrera, exiled by Noriega before the U.S. invasion, was fired
as Panama's deputy police chief in August and was awaiting trial
when he escaped.
   The government has not made public the details of the conspiracy
it alleges he was involved in.
   Herrera had served in the country's Defense Forces until towards
the end of Noriega's decade-old regime, when the dictator accused
him of conspiring to overthrow him and expelled him from Panama.
   After the U.S. invasion, Noriega was taken to Miami, where he is
awaiting trial on drug trafficking and money-laundering charges.
   Endara allowed Herrera to return home and made him deputy chief
of the National Police which replaced the Defense Forces that
Noriega headed.
   Herrera's escape Tuesday coincided with an afternoon march by an
estimated 40,000 public workers to protest government economic
austerity measures, and to demand pay raises and fringe benefits.
   The march, organized by an umbrella group called the Coordinator
of Unions which includes some pro-Noriega leaders, also called for
a 24-hour general strike to pressure the government into accepting
the demands.
   Coordinator leaders said they will call longer general strikes
if their demands are not heeded.
   Endara's government has been laying off hundreds of public
workers under a new labor code it adopted earlier this year, and
has been selling off government-owned companies in an effort to
reduce the budget deficit.

   The dollar fell against major foreign currencies
today in early European trading. Gold prices were also lower.
   Dealers said the dollar fell on an unconfirmed report that Iraq
might be willing to retreat from Kuwait if it were allowed to keep
the disputed Rumailah oil field.
   The dollar is considered a safe haven currency at times of
unrest and chances of a peaceful settlement in the Persian Gulf
pulled the dollar lower.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.93 yen to close at 133.42 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at a higher rate of 133.95 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Tuesday:

<TEXT>
   Notoriously rainy Hilo outdid itself in
November, setting a soggy new record that broke an 89-year-old
mark.
   Rainfall for the month was 45.75 inches, breaking the old record
of 38.80 inches set in 1901, the National Weather Service said
Tuesday.
   The wettest period was between Nov. 14 and Nov. 20 when 29.30
inches fell.
   Hilo also is having its wettest year since 1938, but forecasters
don't expect a new record.
   Through Monday, 181.45 inches of rain had fallen this year, the
most since 188.52 inches fell in 1938.
   The annual rainfall record at Hilo since records have been kept
was 207.40 inches in 1923.
   Hilo lies below two 13,000-foot mountains that funnel ocean
storms toward the coastal city and often causes them to linger.

   A hit list targeting 10 people for revenge
following the killing of anti-Arab Rabbi Meir Kahane worried police
enough for them to offer protection to those threatened.
   Officers and FBI agents have notified all 10 people on the list
thought to have been mailed last month by Kahane supporters, city
Chief of Detectives Joseph Borrelli said Tuesday.
   The letter sent to a New York television news reporter on Nov.
14 contained symbols commonly used by members of the Jewish Defense
League, a militant group founded by Kahane, Borrelli said.
   ``Time is on our side. We will make sure Rabbi Kahane's death
was not in vain,'' the note said. It warned that ``things will go
boom in the night.''
   ``I think it's wise to treat any threats as legitimate,''
Borrelli said, adding that his officers and the FBI were
investigating.
   Arab-American leader M.T. Mehdi and attorney Rita Hauser, U.S.
chair of the International Center for Peace in the Middle East,
were among those named. They said Tuesday that police warned them
about it two weeks ago.
   ``I'm really concerned about it,'' said Hauser, adding that she
was more worried because the list become public.
   Mehdi, secretary general of the National Council on Islamic
Affairs and president of the American-Arab Relations Committee,
said Tuesday he's had private protection ``for some time'' after
1974 attacks left him with a broken back and torched office. ``I
ignore it,'' Mehdi said of the list. ``I believe 100 percent in the
beloved First Amendment. I shall not succumb to any threat.''
   The list also included Louis Farrakhan, head of the Nation of
Islam; Clovis Maksoud, former UN ambassador from the Arab League;
University of Chicago history professor Rashid Khalid; Columbia
University professor Edward Said; New York Times columnist Anthony
Lewis and Rabbi Arthur Hertzberg, a Dartmouth University professor.
   The identities of the two others named could not be confirmed
immediately. Borrelli did not say how many of those on the list
accepted police protection.
   The Jews on the list are considered liberal in their views,
contrasting Kahane's strident calls for the deportation of all
Palestinians from Israel and the occupied territories.
   Hertzberg ``feels personally at risk,'' Dartmouth spokesman Alex
Huppe said.
   ``Discussion about issues should not be conducted under threat
of violence,'' Hertzberg said in a statement. He plans to continue
teaching and speaking out, with extra protection from police and
campus security.
   Said could not be located for comment, Columbia spokesman Fred
Knubel said. Farrakhan, Khalid, Lewis and Maksoud had no immediate
comment.
   Kahane was shot Nov. 5 at a Zionist meeting in New York City.
Arab-born El Sayyid Nosair has been charged with the killing.
Police say they have no evidence linking him to any anti-Israel
organizations.
   Police found another list, this one with the names of six
prominent Jews - including a congressman, two federal judges and a
federal prosecutor - at Nosair's home in Cliffside Park, N.J.

<HEAD>High Tides Cause Flooding, Evacuations in New England</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Wind-whipped rain and a rare high tide battered the New England
coastline, forcing evacautions and closing roads. A change in wind
direction eased the chance of more flooding today.
   Hundreds of coastal residents returned to flooded homes after
Tuesday's storm dumped up to 3 inches of rain in parts of northern
New England and gave Portland, Maine, its fourth-highest tide on
record.
   Weather officials said an unusual alignment of the moon, sun and
Earth caused tides to rise 2 to 3 feet above normal. Strong winds
and heavy rain whipped the waves even higher.
   State and local officials had been on alert for the high tide,
and no injuries were reported. Many feared a repeat of the January
1987 storm that flooded New England coastal areas.
   The tide was expected to crest around noon today. Forecasters
said a change in wind direction from southeast to west lessened the
risk of more flooding.
   ``We shouldn't have any problems,'' said John Cannon of the
National Weather Service in Portland, Maine. ``The seas should be
quite a bit lower.''
   The storm moved out of the Midwest, where a deadly blizzard
dumped up to 2 feet of snow on Monday.
   In Providence, R.I., Civil Defense officials closed the city's
massive hurricane gates for the first time since Hurricane Gloria
brushed the East Coast in September 1985. Hurricane gates in New
Bedford, Mass., also were closed for about four hours because of
high tide coming over the seawalls.
   On Cape Cod, Yarmouth firefighters evacuated about 50 coastal
residents.
   In Eastham, Mass., volunteers waited for high tide to recede to
see what remained of a 6,000-year-old archaeological find an
amateur archaeologist discovered last week. The volunteers tried to
save the remains of a campsite, hearth and dwelling but had to
retreat to higher ground as water rose.
   Authorities in Maine said about 100 people were evacuated from
offices on the Portland Pier, sections of which were under 3 feet
of water.
   Winds of 40 mph to 50 mph hit the Maine coast. The high tide in
Portland was 13.65 feet, nearly 4 feet above its norm but below the
city's all-time high of 14.7 feet.

   Leftist guerrillas exploded a bomb early
today near the U.S. Consulate to protest President Bush's visit
here Thursday, police said. The blast caused minor damage but no
injuries.
   The bomb was planted under a bridge across the Mapocho river,
100 yards from the consulate in front of park near the city center.
   Witnesses told police the bomb was planted by three people
wearing ski masks. They fled in a car.
   Hours later, an anonymous caller told a local news agency that
the bomb was planted by the Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front, a
pro-Communist urban guerrilla gang, to protest Bush's visit. He is
scheduled to arrive Thursday morning on the fourth leg of a
five-country South American tour.
   Police said they also found a mock bomb outside the consulate.
   Late Sunday, three bombs went off in Santiago, causing minor
damage but no injuries. The targets were the offices of two
right-wing political parties and a Mormon chapel.
   Another leftist guerrilla group, the Lautaro Front, claimed
responsibility for those bombs, saying they were ``an offensive''
against Bush's visit.

   A U.S. congressman today expressed disappointment
in human rights discussions with Chinese officials and said
Beijing's prosecution of people involved in the pro-democracy
movement raises serious rights concerns.
   Trials of pro-democracy advocates raise questions that will not
be overshadowed by the Persian Gulf crisis, said Robert Torricelli,
a New Jersey Democrat.
   Torricelli also criticized China's abstention on a U.N. measure
authorizing the use of military force to dislodge Iraqi troops from
Kuwait. He said he told Chinese officials this week that they
``missed an important and dramatic opportunity'' to improve China's
international standing.
   Torricelli, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee,
said he was disappointed by human rights discussions with Vice
Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu and other Foreign Ministry officials.
   Human rights will be the focus of U.S. discussions on China's
most-favored nation trade status and lifting sanctions imposed
after the bloody crackdown last year on protesters demanding
democratic reforms, he said.
   ``There seems to be a general judgment here that the worst in
their relationship with the United States has passed, that the
world is looking at other problems, that what might happen here
with further prosecutions will be little noticed,'' he said. ``It
is my view that that is a tragic mistake if that is their
judgment.''
   Torricelli said Chinese officials voiced regret over the army's
June 1989 suppression of the pro-democracy movement but seemed most
concerned with the international condemnation that followed.
   Soldiers killed hundreds, perhaps thousands, of protesters.
Thousands were arrested in a nationwide crackdown against dissent
that followed.
   According to court officials and Chinese sources, about a dozen
major figures in the pro-democracy movement have been charged with
counterrevolutionary crimes. At least two have been charged with
plotting to overthrow the government, a crime punishable by death.
   Torricelli said China should grant amnesty to people jailed
because of their political activities linked to the movement.
   Torricelli also said he told officials China acted irresponsibly
by abstaining on a Security Council resolution Thursday that
authorized force against Iraq if it refuses to withdraw troops from
Kuwait.
   China was the only permanent member of the council that did not
support it.

   Fire was spotted on the wing of a
Northwest jetliner after it landed at Detroit Metropolitan Airport
today. The fire was put out and passengers safely left the
aircraft, officials said.
   Northwest Airlines spokeswoman Christy Clapp said residual fuel
in an auxilary power unit ignited on the right wing. She said the
fire was spotted by ground crews as the Boeing 727 was taxiing to
the terminal.
   A ground agent put out the fire at the gate, and firefighters
doused the plane with chemical foam to prevent another flareup.
   Flight 582, with 69 passengers and six crew members aboard,
landed at the airport about 6 a.m. after a flight from Seattle. The
passengers left the plane at the terminal gate, Clapp said from
Northwest headquarters in Eagan, Minn.
   An unidentified passenger told television station WXYZ that
there was no panic among the passengers.
   The wing unit runs the plane's air conditioning on the ground,
Clapp said.
   Flight 582 was scheduled to continue to Newark, N.J., Clapp
said. The passengers were put on other flights.
   National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Alan Pollock said
the agency would decide whether to investigate after it receives
reports on the fire.
   On Monday, two Northwest Airlines jets collided on a runway at
the airport west of Detroit. A fireball swept one of the planes,
killing eight people.

   A new ground radar system to be installed
at airports in Detroit and 29 other cities will help air traffic
controllers prevent accidents like the one in Detroit, a federal
official said.
   The new system is designed to track vehicle and aircraft
movement on runways, Robert Bartanowicz, supervisor of the Federal
Aviation Administration Academy in Oklahoma City, said Tuesday.
   ``It gives us a video map of the airport on the radar screen,''
Bartanowicz said. ``It can paint runways, ramp areas and pickup
targets such as trucks and aircraft.
   ``It will especially be useful during periods of low
visibility,'' he said.
   Detroit, which doesn't have ground radar, is among the first 10
cities scheduled to receive the Airport Surface Detection Equipment
3 sometime after March, he said.
   A collision between two jetliners on a Detroit runway Monday
killed eight people and injured 24 others. A transcript obtained by
NBC indicated the pilot of one plane told an air traffic controller
moments before the accident that he was lost in the fog.
   Bartanowicz said the FAA currently is testing the system in
Pittsburgh.
   ``These are highly reliable and much better, much improved,''
Bartanowicz said. ``It's a good way of directing surface traffic.''
   He said tests on the model in Pittsburgh are not complete. But
the FAA academy is set to receive one for training in March 1991.
He said other models will be installed in airports sometime after
that.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney will ask
NATO allies for more help in transporting American troops to the
Persian Gulf region, a U.S. official said today.
   The official said the appeal would be made at a two-day defense
ministers meeting starting Thursday.
   The official cited a need for planes and ships to bring more
American troops and their gear to the gulf, for help in
transporting U.S. troops through European ports, and also for more
chemical-warfare protective gear.
   ``All of them (the allies) have made some contributions to the
effort in the gulf,'' said the official. But he said more help is
needed for ``this massive undertaking.''
   ``We have some requirements that have already been presented and
not all have been met,'' said the official, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   ``We need (chemical warfare) suits. We have received some,
notably from the Germans. The British and some of the Arab forces
need them as well,'' said the official.
   There are now about 300,000 U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf
region, a number that is to increase to more than 400,000 in the
next weeks.
   About 100,000 American troops are being transported from Europe.
   Today, NATO's European defense ministers met to discuss the
prospect of war in the gulf and a new conventional and nuclear
defense strategy for the allies to reflect a new East-West
relationship.
   Cheney and Canadian Defense Minister Bill McKnight join them
Thursday for two more days of talks on the same issues.
   The meeting comes one week after the adoption of the U.N.
resolution authorizing military action against Iraq unless it
leaves Kuwait by Jan. 15, almost six months after it invaded and
annexed its small neighbor.
   In all, forces from 27 nations are lined up against Iraq. All 16
NATO allies, except Turkey, Luxembourg, Iceland and Germany have
sent forces to the gulf region.
   In recent weeks, Washington issued two separate appeals to its
allies for help in flying and shipping American forces to the gulf.
   While the response has been generally good, officials said more
help was needed in view of the scope of the U.S. military buildup.
   NATO will not specify the contribution each of the allies has
made to date for fear that providing such a breakdown would
generate friction within the alliance.

<TEXT>
   The opposition today selected the chief
justice of the Supreme Court to head a caretaker government,
meeting President Hussain Muhammad Ershad's condition for
resigning.
   Thousands of people poured into the streets to celebrate
Ershad's dramatic resignation announcement Tuesday night. Several
thousand people assembled at Dhaka airport demanding that
authorities prevent Ershad or other government officials from
fleeing.
   In the northern town of Rajshahi, a student leader was killed
and two other people were wounded by security guards when they
marched on the home of a high-ranking state official.
   Ershad, a 60-year-old former army general, capitulated to the
opposition's intense, seven-week campaign to oust him and said he
would step down as soon as the opposition agreed on a candidate to
replace him.
   Chief Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed's candidacy was expected to sail
through Parliament on Saturday with Ershad's support, said
opposition leader Khaleda Zia. Sheik Hasina, another top opposition
leader, confirmed the choice.
   Jubilant opposition leaders appealed for calm today. For the
first time, speeches by the two women who had led the long struggle
to unseat Ershad were broadcast on state-controlled media.
   ``We have initiated the path of victory for democracy. We must
take the movement to its final victory,'' Ms. Hasina, leader of the
opposition Awami League, said in a recorded speech.
   ``The autocratic regime has fallen. Now is the time to display
restraint and maintain peace to take our movement for democracy to
a total victory,'' said Mrs. Zia, head of the Bangladesh
Nationalist Party.
   Mrs. Zia and Ms. Hasina also warned the president of ``the
people's wrath'' if he reneges on his promise to quit.
   Addressing a rally of 50,000 cheering and chanting followers,
Ms. Hasina warned that the effort to unseat Ershad was not over.
``Although Ershad announced that he had resigned, in fact he is
still in power,'' she said.
   She called for immediate dissolution of the Cabinet and handing
over power to a neutral caretaker government.
   ``Ershad is conspiring to stay in power,'' Mrs. Zia said. ``Let
there be no doubt that people will fight until they have achieved
the victory and ousted the autocratic government.''
   Seizing power in a bloodless coup in 1982, Ershad governed under
martial law for four years, then quit the army and staged an
election in 1986 which observers agreed was rigged.
   The drive to force Ershad's resignation began after he said he
would seek re-election in June. The opposition insisted that a fair
vote would be impossible unless he handed over power to a neutral
administrator.
   Shahabuddin's confirmation as vice president would clear the way
for him to succeed Ershad in compliance with Bangladesh's
constitution.
   Once in office, the caretaker government would likely dissolve
Parliament, making new elections possible. The opposition parties
boycotted previous elections, saying Ershad would have rigged the
voting against them.
   If Ershad's replacement is chosen by the opposition and approved
by Parliament, it will be the first peaceful transition of power in
Bangladesh.
   The campaign for Ershad's ouster had mushroomed in recent weeks,
with doctors, university professors, some of Ershad's
parliamentarians and civil servants resigning in solidarity with
the opposition.
   Last week, Ershad imposed a state of emergency in an attempt to
crush the movement. The army was called out to counter street
protests, and the opposition claimed at least 100 political
activists were shot and killed.
   This morning, scores of victory processions paraded through the
streets of Dhaka, unhindered by police. The houses of Ershad's
ministers were under extra guard by troops.
   Mobs attacked four ministers' residences and the offices of
Ershad's Jatiya Party after his announcement.
   Ershad canceled all appointments and remained at his home deep
inside Dhaka's well-guarded military cantonment, according to an
aide who spoke on condition of anomymity.
   ``He is still in charge of the government,'' the senior minister
in his Cabinet said. Other sources said the armed forces were still
taking orders from Ershad.
   Ms. Hasina combined forces with Mrs. Zia in October to renew the
pressure on Ershad to quit. Previous efforts to unseat him were
undermined by the rivalry between the two women.
   Ms. Hasina is the daughter of Sheik Mujibur Rahman, Bangladesh's
first president. Mrs. Zia is the widow of Ziaur Rehman, another
former president. Both men were assassinated.
   Bangladesh has had nine presidents since it gained independence
in 1971, and all have taken over after assassinations or military
coups.
   Though Ershad gave Bangladesh a measure of political stability,
he made little headway in alleviating the misery of his people.
   Bangladesh, one of the poorest nations in the world, has more
than 107 million people. It is bordered by India, Burma and the Bay
of Bengal.

   NASA tried to get its troublesome
$150 million observatory working right today as more and more
star-gazing time evaporated on Columbia's scientific mission,
already set back by four years of delays.
   Astronaut-astronomers Ron Parise and Robert Parker got in 36
percent of the observation time planned for their 12-hour shift
that ended this morning, NASA said. That compares to 17 percent in
the crew's previous work period and none before that.
   Among the targets viewed today was a galaxy 41 million light
years away that is believed to contain a black hole and Crab
Nebula, a remnant of a supernova that occurred more than 900 years
ago.
   ``We're trying as hard as we can,'' Parise told ground
controllers.
   Ten percent of the Astro observatory's 230 planned celestial
targets could have to be scrapped because of the trouble with its
automatic aiming systems, NASA scientist Ted Gull said Tuesday.
   It could be several days before the observatory aboard the
shuttle is working at peak efficiency, Gull said.
   After a day of problems Monday, Columbia's astronauts reported
early Tuesday that the observatory's instrument pointing system
appeared to be working properly.
   The system, which automatically aims Astro's three ultraviolet
telescopes, developed glitches later in the day before it was
coaxed back into operation early today.
   Problems persisted, however, through the morning. Spacelab
Mission Operations Control's John David Bartoe at one point
informed the astronauts that ``this is by far the most stable
pointing we've seen so far.''
   ``Except that the target isn't in the (telescope),'' replied
Parise.
   New software later was transmitted to correct the sensitivity of
one of the instrument pointing system's three star trackers.
Fine-tuning of the system was expected to continue through the day.
   The observatory also has an X-ray telescope, which has its own
pointing system and is controlled by computer commands from the
ground. The telescope unexpectedly fell out of alignment Tuesday
night, but ground controllers corrected the problem today and got
the instrument operating again. Clusters of galaxies were observed.
   ``It's sort of a continuing story - nothing's quite right yet,''
said Arthur Davidsen of Johns Hopkins University, principal
investigator for one of the ultraviolet telescopes.
   The astronauts used the ultraviolet telescopes' pointing system
to spot a few targets Tuesday, but they sometimes had to aim the
telescopes manually, a less precise and more time-consuming
operation. The manual operation was not always successful, either.
   Trouble with the pointing system has cost scientists valuable
star-gazing time, forcing to them to drop some low-priority targets
from their list.
   Columbia's 10-day mission is the first shuttle flight in five
years dedicated entirely to scientific research.
   Columbia's mission was scheduled to fly in 1986 but was
postponed because of the Challenger explosion. The flight also was
delayed for six months this year because of shuttle hydrogen leaks
and other problems.
   The equipment problems have frustrated scientists who have been
anxious to use the observatory to study X-rays and ultraviolet rays
that cannot penetrate Earth's atmosphere.
   Davidsen said he remained optimistic.
   ``I would be surprised if they could not conquer this problem
within the next day or so,'' he said Tuesday night. ``If they can
conquer it by (today), and we can do excellent observations until
the end of the mission, we can recover very nicely. The instruments
are showing us that if we can point at these targets, we're going
to get spectacular data.''
   Also on Tuesday, the astronauts twice spotted the Soviet Mir
space station. Mir was orbiting with five men 32 miles above
Columbia, which is carrying seven astronauts in an orbit 218 miles
above Earth.

<HEAD>Kidnapped Bolivian Entrepreneur Killed by Guerrillas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of Bolivia's most prominent
businessmen was shot to death today by his leftist guerrilla
kidnappers during a shoot out with police trying to rescue him,
authorities said.
   Jorge Lonsdale - the owner of the country's Coca-Cola
distributorship and other properties - was kidnapped in June by
members of the Nestor Paz Zamora Commando movement. The leftist
group is responsible for a string of recent terror attacks,
including the bombing of a U.S. Marine residence.
   Interior Minister Guillermo Capobianco said negotiations for
Lonsdale's release were under way between his family and the
captors when fighting broke out early today between the guerrillas
and troops surrounding their hideout.
   He said preliminary reports indicated that Lonsdale was shot in
the head by Michael Northtufster, an Italian who is one of the
group's leaders. Capobianco said Northtufster was then killed in
the shootout with police and soldiers.
   Two other guerrillas also were killed in the exchange of
gunfire, and three were captured, Capobianco said.
   He said several policemen were injured in the fighting.
   The Nestor Paz Zamora group takes its name from the late brother
of Bolivia's current president, Jaime Paz Zamora. Nestor Paz Zamora
launched an unsuccessful guerrilla movement in Bolivia in 1970, the
year before his brother founded the Revolutoonary Left Movement,
currently the governing party.
   The Nestor Paz Zamora group claimed responsibility for a bomb
attack on Oct. 11 on a U.S. Marine residence in La Paz. A Bolivian
policeman guarding the building was killed and a statue of John F.
Kennedy was destroyed.
   Police said several members of the commando group detained in
connection with the October bombing were linked to the Lonsdale
kidnapping. They said police discovered a small wooden cage used to
imprison Lonsdale in one of two safe houses where the kidnapped
businessman was held.
   Lonsdale, one of Bolivia's most affluent entrepreneurs, headed a
major Bolivian soccer team and was part owner of a La Paz daily, La
Razon.
   The kidnappers initially demanded $8 million in ransom for
Lonsdale's release, but family members said they lowered the demand
to $500,000 Tuesday. The family had planned to pay the ransom
through a Catholic church leader.
   Capobianco told reporters the police decided to intervene today
and attempt a rescue when they grew concerned the guerrillas
intended to kill Lonsdale. He did not elaborate.
   But a leftist legislator, Gregorio Lanza, who watched the
confrontation, disputed Capobianco's account. ``I want to denounce
before the country that the government did not keep its promise of
a truce (with the kidnappers.) Thirty policemen took part in the
operation,'' Lanza said.
   Authorities said Northtufster, 29, the commando leader who was
killed in the shootout, was a native of Bolzano, Italy. They said
he arrived in Bolivia in 1982 to work with the poor and became a
Jesuit seminarian. They said he broke off his religious studies to
study sociology at La Paz University, and it was not known when he
joined the guerrilla group.

   President Corazon Aquino's government
today raised fuel prices by more than 45 percent, and congressional
and labor leaders warned that new strikes and unrest would result.
   Mrs. Aquino said the government had no choice but to increase
prices because of soaring costs for crude oil since Iraq invaded
Kuwait in August.
   Although an increase had been expected, the size of it stunned
the public. The price increase was considerably more than requested
by the three oil companies.
   Long lines formed at gasoline stations as motorists sought to
beat the 6 p.m. price change. Leaders of the two major labor
federations called emergency meetings to consider a general strike.
   ``God have mercy on those who made this decision,'' said Sen.
Ernesto Maceda, a leading critic of other recent fuel price
increases. ``This is a most painful, most stinging and baseless
decision.''
   In an announcement only two hours before the increases took
effect, the Energy Regulatory Board raised premium gasoline from 31
cents to 57 cents a liter. The price of liquefied petroleum gas,
widely used in cooking, was increased by about 50 percent.
   Smaller but substantial increases were mandated for all other
grades of petroleum, including diesel, aviation fuel, and kerosene.
   Fuel price increases in 1987 and 1989 were followed quickly by
major coup attempts against Mrs. Aquino. The last fuel price rises,
in September, led to a nationwide strike by left-wing unions.
   Consumer prices for fuel are subsidized by the government. The
Philippines imports virtually all its petroleum, and increases in
crude oil prices have strained the government's hard-currency
reserves.
   In a televised statement, Mrs. Aquino claimed she had no
authority to influence decisions of the Energy Regulatory Board,
although it is directly subordinate to her office.
   She urged the board to reduce the increases for kerosene,
petroleum gas and diesel and to transfer them to other categories
of petroleum ``that will not affect so much our poor countrymen.''
   Several Cabinet members appeared to have been caught by surprise
by the announcement. Labor Secretary Ruben Torres said he was
``shocked.''
   Transport Secretary Oscar Orbos urged reporters to tone down
critical reports about the price increase to ``help the
president.''
   Sources at some newspapers controlled by the government said
editors were told by Mrs. Aquino's staff to refrain from critical
remarks about the price increase.

<HEAD>Walesa Lead Appears To Widen In Latest Poll</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with Cheney wishing Walesa victory.
TRIMS.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa has widened
his lead over dark-horse challenger Stanislaw Tyminski four days
before the final presidential vote, according to an independent
poll published today.
   In another boost for Walesa, U.S. Defense Secretary Richard B.
Cheney met with the Solidarity leader today in Gdansk and wished
him ``victory and success'' in the runoff election.
   ``I have certain political experience and I feel that I have
talked today with the man who will win,'' Cheney, a former
congressman, told Walesa in the presence of reporters at the end of
their 40-minute meeting at Solidarity headquarters in Gdansk.
   ``I wish you victory and success in this difficult task,'' he
said.
   Tyminski had claimed during a rally Tuesday that he was invited
to meet with Cheney but turned down the invitation.
   A U.S. source said Tyminski was on the guest list for an embassy
reception for Cheney but that no special meeting was planned.
   In the poll, 61 percent of those questioned supported Walesa and
20 percent backed Tyminski. The remaining 19 percent were
undecided, according to the survey conducted by the private polling
service Demoskop and commissioned by the government-owned newspaper
Rzeczpospolita.
   An opinion poll conducted a week ago by state television put
Walesa's support at 58 percent and Tyminski's at 30 percent.
   A Polish emigre businessman who says he made a fortune in Peru
and Canada, Tyminski returned to his native land in September and
scored a stunning second-place finish in the first round of voting
on Nov. 25. His victory forced Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki
out of the race.
   The poll published today was based on a survey of 988 people
across the nation and conducted on Tuesday. No margin for error was
given.
   At a news conference on Tuesday, Tyminski said his own soundings
showed him trailing Walesa 44 percent to 50 percent, with his
support growing by 1.5 percent daily.
   Today, Tyminski campaign officials denied a claim made in a
report on Polish television that he had beaten his wife and refused
to give food and medicine to his children in Canada last year.
   The charge was made in a taped interview broadcast late Tuesday
by a woman identified only as Clara Fox.
   ``The information has nothing in common with the truth,'' said
campaign spokeswoman Agnieska Majewska.
   Tyminksi acknowledged an acquaintance with the Foxes, but said
it was only slight.
   ``Mr. Fox visited us two times and I threw him out because he
acted in an uncultured way,'' Tyminski said. ``He behaved in a very
un-Catholic way. He insulted my wife and was thrown out.''
   Tyminski has promised to quickly improve Poland's economy and
has blamed many of its problems on Walesa and Mazowiecki, who heads
Poland's first non-Communist government in more than four decades.
   But Tyminski has also been criticized for his leadership of the
fringe Libertarian Party of Canada, his advocacy of nuclear weapons
and his long absence from Poland.

   New York state is laying off 10,000 workers. Los Angeles has
stopped hiring new police officers even though street crime is
getting worse. Maryland halted a program that buys medicine for the
poor.
   Across the nation, state and local officials are making tough
choices. Squeezed by falling revenue, they are balancing the books
the hard way, by cutting back on what government can do.
   ``I guarantee you we won't be able to care for as many foster
children, mentally ill and so forth as we did last year of the year
before,'' said Roger Wilson, a state senator from Missouri, which
faces a projected $70 million shortfall.
   At least 26 states face deficits or budget shortfalls this
fiscal year. Nearly all have made spending cuts and face more as
the economy worsens.
   ``It becomes a political decision. Do you want to let people out
of jail early or do you want to pay a higher sales tax? Do you cut
education or cut health care to the old and indigent?'' said Marsha
Howard, research director for the National Association of State
Budget Directors.
   Dozens of cities have resorted to layoffs or freezes.
Washington, D.C., will cut at least 2,000 workers. Philadelphia,
facing bankruptcy by Christmas, has imposed a hiring freeze as a
prelude to more severe steps.
   A $20 million deficit has forced a seven-month hiring freeze in
Los Angeles. That will mean fewer new police officers at a time
when the homicide rate approaches an all-time record.
   ``Budgets should not be a roller coaster ride for general
managers, city employees or the public,'' complained Police Chief
Daryl Gates.
   Los Angeles and Louisville, Ky., have closed neighborhood health
centers. Vermont and Maryland are putting off programs to help the
old and poor pay for prescriptions.
   Maryland health advocates say the cuts will affect 300 people
with AIDS, although state officials say help is available through
other programs.
   After several years of belt-tightening, services once considered
untouchable now face cuts, including schools, Medicaid and prisons.
On average, 25 percent of state budgets go to education, 14 percent
to Medicaid and 5 percent to prisons.
   Options are even more limited for local officials, who rely
heavily on federal and state aid. Federal funds have dried up and
some states, such as Massachusetts, New York and Minnesota, have
cut local aid.
   ``We're the last government on the end of the rung,'' said Paul
Rouis, administrator for Sullivan County, N.Y., which raised
property taxes and froze salaries. ``We've been successful at
cutting our spending, but the sponge is dry.''
   The Northeast has been hardest hit. New York Gov. Mario Cuomo
has proposed a $1 billion spending cut that would affect jobs,
school aid, Medicaid, help for the homeless and those with AIDS,
and other services. An ambitious hospital support plan has been
scrapped. There will be less snowplowing and fewer lights on the
state's highways this winter.
   Massachusetts has already laid off 1,711 workers, leaving fewer
people to minister to abused children and clean hazardous waste
sites. In Maine, despite rosy forecasts by Gov. John McKernan
during his re-election campaign, he is proposing the postponement
of $73 million in contributions to a teacher retirement fund.
McKernan also says layoffs are inevitable.
   Nationwide, at least seven states have fired or will fire
workers. Five more have imposed hiring freezes.
   Virginia has laid off 700 employees, including mental hospital
workers and college faculty and staff. Gov. L. Douglas Wilder has
ordered a mental hospital closed.
   ``We're kind of like a boat in a swift-flowing stream and I am
trying to keep that boat right where it is instead of being swept
downstream in that current,'' said Gov.-elect Zell Miller of
Georgia, where dropping revenues threaten layoffs next year.
   State college tuition is rising in Massachusetts, New Hampshire,
North Carolina, Virginia and New Jersey. New York City faces
teacher layoffs. Some New Hampshire schools have eliminated
kindergarten.
   Some officials try to avoid unpleasant choices by shifting
funds. Iowa transferred $20 million earmarked for environmental
programs to prevent a budget shortfall. Dade County, Fla., borrowed
$10 million from a building renovation fund rather than lay off 100
people, a move some opposed.
   ``Borrowing long term to fund current operating costs starts us
down a dangerously slippery slope,'' said County Commissioner
Charles Dusseau.

   President Bush will meet with Iraqi Foreign
Minister Tariq Aziz in Washington on Dec. 17 to discuss ways to
defuse the Persian Gulf crisis, a French radio network reported
today.
   Yasser Abed-Rabbo, a member of the Executive Committee of the

   In Washington, Bill Harlow, a White House spokesman, said no
date had been set for the Aziz meeting. Bush said it would take
place the week of Dec. 10.
   Abed-Rabbo attended a meeting Tuesday in Baghdad of senior
officials from Iraq, the PLO, Jordan and Yemen to discuss Bush's
proposal to send Secretary of State James A. Baker III to Baghdad
and to invite Aziz to Washington to discuss the 4-month-old crisis,
Radio France Internationale said.
   ``The Baghdad meeting was to study the current situation, as
well as to fix a date for the Iraqi-American meeting, which was
fixed for Dec. 17.'' Abed-Rabbo said in a telephone interview from
Tunis, Tunisia, where the PLO's headquarters is located.
   He gave no other details about the meeting or how the date was
determined.

<HEAD>Moscow Agrees to Compensate Iraq; Exit Permits For Soviets Being

<TEXT>
   Iraq today began processing exit permits
for Soviet citizens, and Soviet officials said they were willing to
discuss compensation for terminating the work contracts of more
than 3,200 Soviet citizens.
   ``If there are going to be costs, we are prepared to bear those
costs because we feel that the security and well-being of our
citizens should come first,'' Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman
Vitaly Churkin said in Moscow.
   Iraq demanded the compensation Monday, when it announced the
Soviet citizens would be freed.
   When Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, there were about 8,000
Soviet experts in Iraq, building pipelines, working on construction
projects and advising the Iraqi oil industry.
   A Soviet diplomat in Baghdad, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said more than 200 exit visas were issued before the
Interior Ministry closed for the day.
   He said an Illyushin IL-86 jet, which can carry up to 400
passengers, was expected to land in Baghdad on Thursday to pick up
the first of the departing Soviets. Thursday's flight will stop in
Ankara, Turkey, to be checked for possible contraband in violation
of U.N. trade sanctions.
   Aeroflot, the Soviet Union's national carrier, currently flies
smaller planes twice a week to Baghdad.
   The five-member Command Council, headed by President Saddam
Hussein, announced Monday it was allowing the Soviets to leave. The
decision came five days after Moscow, once Iraq's chief patron,
threatened to send troops to the gulf if Iraq did not release
Soviet citizens.
   Iraq banned foreigners from leaving the country in response to a
U.S.-led military buildup that followed the invasion.
   However, the Soviets in Iraq have not been listed among Saddam's
other ``guests'' - the hundreds of Americans, Europeans and
Japanese held hostage, or the 600 men held as human shields at
strategic locations to deter attack.
   Churkin, the Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, said he did not
know how much money the Soviet Union might have to pay to Iraq in
compensation.
   ``We have had an extensive economic relationship with Iraq and
it will have to be seen what kind of balance there exists in our
transactions with that country,'' he said.
   But Churkin praised the decision to release the Soviet citizens.
   ``Moscow expresses satisfaction with the Iraqi leadership's
decision and proceeds from the fact that our people can now leave
Iraq and return home without hindrance.''
   Still, Churkin said the Iraqi move did not lessen Moscow's
opposition to the invasion and annexation of Kuwait.
   ``Our attitude will not change at all,'' he said.

<HEAD>Study Shows Hospitals Tests For AIDS Without Consent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly one in four U.S. hospitals do not require
patients' consent before testing for AIDS, and one in four do not
require that a patient be told if the results are positive,
according to a study published today.
   The study of 561 hospitals, reported in today's issue of the
Journal of he American Medical Association, also concluded that
two-thirds of all the nation's hospitals and about 40 percent of
its rural hospitals have admitted at least one patient with
acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   ``AIDS is no longer a disease ... of just 20 cities,'' said Dr.
Charles E. Lewis, professor of medicine at the University of
California, Los Angeles, and co-author of the study.
   But despite the disease's spread, a clear, comprehensive policy
has not been developed by hospitals to protect the rights of
patients, the study concluded.
   ``From the perspective of a potential patient,'' the study's
researchers wrote, ``the current state of policy ... provides no
guarantee that their rights will be protected.''
   According to the study, 22 percent of the nation's hospitals do
not have a policy requiring that they inform patients they will be
tested for the AIDS virus. And 25.3 percent of the hospitals do not
have a policy requiring that patients be told they have tested
positive for the AIDS virus.
   Fifty-six percent of the hospitals have policies requiring that
AIDS test results be included in patients' records; 38 percent
require that treatment plans be reviewed when patients test
positive and 3 percent require that patients testing positive be
discharged or moved to other facilities.
   Researchers wrote that the discrepancy in policies may be the
result of the difficulty in trying to create a policy that protects
both patients and hospital employees as well as guards against
lawsuits being filed by either group.
   ``Not only do hospitals face potential risk of litigation from
patients for violation of their rights, but hospitals also may be
held responsible for placing health care personnel at increased
risk by withholding relevant information about infected patients,''
the study said.

<TEXT>
   Riverboat gambling was narrowly approved in
a referendum in one Gulf Coast county, but voters in two other
counties rejected the idea of floating casinos along their docks.
   Voters in the three Gulf Coast counties went to the polls
Tuesday. Hancock voters approved dockside gambling by a vote of
4,246 to 4,004.
   But voters in Harrison County rejected gambling by a vote of
18,490 to 17,463 and Jackson County voters rejected it 15,351 to
9,508.
   The state Legislature in June approved a law legalizing
riverboat gambling along the Mississippi River and Mississippi's
Gulf Coast, but gave voters in individual counties the option of
prohibiting it by referendum.
   Only 38 percent of the eligible voters cast ballots in Hancock
County, election officials reported. Officials reported a 52
percent turnout in Harrison County and a 47 percent turnout in
Jackson County.
   ``I think there were two factors,'' Eldon Bolton, chairman of
the Harrison County Election Commission, said of the turnout. ``One
was the moral issue and the other was the economic issue.''
   Supporters and opponents of dockside gambling waged expensive
media campaigns. Opponents warned that dockside gambling would
increase crime and corruption. Supporters said it would draw
tourists and create jobs.

<HEAD>Newspaper Publishes `Who's Who' of Moscow Crime Gangs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper today published what it described as a
``Who's Who of Moscow racketeers'' and a map of city neighborhoods
controlled by the 10 major criminal groups in the Soviet capital.
   The weekly Commersant business newspaper said it sent a copy of
its map and stories to Moscow's Internal Affairs Department for
comment. Two days later, the department replied that ``organized
crime does not exist as such in Moscow,'' the newspaper said.
   Commersant said organized crime controls some or all of Moscow's
drug trade, prostitution, slot machines, video arcades and used-car
sales. But its main business is extracting protection money, mostly
from restaurants and other semi-private enterprises, it said.
   ``Whenever the supply of a product is forcibly kept below demand
- such as narcotics in the West or alcohol during Prohibition -
organized crime steps in and thrives,'' the newspaper said.
   ``But in a country such as the Soviet Union where virtually
everything is difficult to obtain, the opportunities for organized
crime are endless. Couple that with an overstretched police force
and you have an explosive situation.''
   The new Soviet interior minister, Boris Pugo, said Tuesday that
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is ``very concerned with the rise in
organized crime.''
   ``However, the struggle with this crime hasn't been effective
enough so far,'' Pugo told the government newspaper Izvestia.
   He said ``corruption has penetrated all organizations, all
bodies of power, including the highest echelons.''
   Commersant said its picture of Moscow's underworld was drawn
from anonymous informants and written by journalists who asked not
to be identified for fear of gangland retribution.
   Moscow gangs have grown since 1988, when the two oldest and
largest groups held a ``gangster summit'' to divide the city into
spheres of influence, the newspaper said.
   That system soon broke down, and now there are more than 10
major criminal gangs known as teams or brigades, with a combined
membership of about 6,000 people, Commersant said.
   It said the Assyrian Brigade has a monopoly on the illegal drug
trade and operates out of the central Krasnaya Presnya district,
home to the Moscow Zoo and several embassies.
   The Dolgoprudnay Brigade controls northern Moscow and leads in
racketeering, particularly extracting protection money, Commersant
said.
   Other gangs control warehouses and hard-currency restaurants,
black-market leather and fur, counterfeiting and extortion of vodka
salesmen, the paper said.

<TEXT>
   A former senior police official who
escaped from prison and then seized national police headquarters
was captured today by American troops after he fled the building.
   The former police official, Col. Eduardo Herrera Hassan, walked
out of the building ringed by a group of policemen loyal to him and
an estimated 80 journalists who were trying to ask him questions.
The cluster crossed a roadblock manned by American troops, and
Herrera, who was wearing civilian clothes, got away in the
confusion.
   Herrera escaped in a car but was captured a short time later at
a condominium building near the police heaquarters.
   Several shots were fired, and one of Herrera's supporters was
wounded. About 50 armed men with Herrera also gave up after trying
to flee.
   Herrera escaped Tuesday afternoon from prison on the Pacific
island of Nao aboard a private helicopter, and took over the police
headquarters near the Panama Canal early today.
   U.S. troops and Panamanian police then took up positions 300
yards away from the building. But both sides held their fire.
   Before fleeing, Herrera met with U.S. and Panamanian officials,
but it was not immediately known what they discussed.
   The U.S. Embassy had issued a statement that said: ``In answer
to a request from the government of Panama, the United States has
provided military support to the National Police to help in the
protection of the area around the National Police headquarters.''
   The United States maintains about 12,000 troops in Panama to
protect the canal until Panama takes it over at the end of the
century.
   The standoff was the first challenge to the nearly year-old
government of President Guillermo Endara. Herrera said he was not
trying to overthrow the government but gain more respect for the
police.
   The National Police force was created after U.S. forces invaded
last December and toppled Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, who is
jailed in Miami awaiting trial on drug-trafficking and
money-laundering charges.
   Herrera, a former Noriega associate, was fired as deputy
national police chief in August and jailed in October on charges of
conspiring against the new government.
   Before fleeing the headquarters, Herrera claimed to have control
of Panama's police force, but it was not known how much support he
had among police officers.
   Officials said he tried to take over a police station on the
outskirts of the city Tuesday night but failed. He managed to take
over police headquarters early today.
   Endara said his government had the support of the majority of
the country's police and accused Herrera of trying to stage a coup.
   Herrera allowed reporters into the police headquarters for a
news conference this morning and said: ``This is a movement that is
not a military coup.''
   He said members of the police force ``felt humiliated and wanted
me to be their spokesman. I came to cooperate in the reconciliation
of this country. No one has been kidnapped. No shot has been
fired.''
   Herrera did not elaborate on the alleged discontent.
   There were about 100 men with Herrera at the news conference.
Some said they were being held against their will. Herrera said all
were free to leave.
   It was not known if he took any hostages with him when he fled
the building.
   Herrera was a member of Noriega's Panama Defense Forces. But he
had been on the outs with Noriega, who forced Herrera to leave the
country by naming him ambassador to Israel prior to the U.S.
invasion.
   After ousting Noriega, the U.S. government installed Endara, who
had won popular elections that Noriega anulled.
   Herrera returned to Panama and was named deputy police chief in
January. The Defense Forces were dissolved and replaced with the
National Police, which number about 12,000 and contain some members
of the old force.
   In describing his escape for reporters, Herrera said, ``A
helicopter landed and took me from prison. I didn't know who they
were until the men removed their masks and I realized that they
were members of the police force.''
   Prison guards fired at the departing helicopter, but there were
n reports of injuries.
   A U.S. Army officer met with Herrera early today, but there was
no indication of what they discussed. Herrera said he had assured
the U.S. officer that he did not want bloodshed. Herrera said he
also met with Panamanian officials to present them with complaints
of officers.
   Endara said Tuesday night that Herrera had tried unsuccessfully
to seize a police station in the Panama City neighborhood of San
Miguelito. ``He called several provinces and we know he failed
absolutely. He called over the National Police radio network and he
got no response,'' Endara told a news conference.
   Officials said Herrera apparently visited other police stations
before arriving by car at the headquarters in Panama City early
today.

   The Navy is sacking a senior commander and
reassigning two other top officials for failing to inform top
Pentagon leaders of serious setbacks in the development of the A-12
attack aircraft program.
   Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett III announced the actions
Tuesday as the Pentagon released an internal Navy report that
outlined a breakdown in supervision of the 6-year-old aircraft
program.
   The A-12 Avenger ``stealth'' bomber is the Navy's top aircraft
priority. The carrier-based plane is scheduled to begin replacing
the aging fleet of A-6 Intruder attack planes in 1995 and to serve
as a mainstay well into the 21st century.
   Garrett wrote in a memo to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney that
the Navy's A-12 program supervisors failed to make clear to top
Navy and Pentagon leaders last spring that the project was faring
much worse than the contractor claimed.
   The plane's development is more than a year behind schedule and
at least 20 percent over the planned $4.7 billion cost.
   The controversy heated up last June when the contractors,
General Dynamics and McDonnell Douglas, told the Navy they could
not produce the first plane on time, that costs were escalating and
that certain performance standards for the aircraft could not be
met.
   Just a few weeks before that, Cheney had announced after a
high-level Pentagon review of the A-12 program that it was fully on
track.
   Garrett told Cheney he was forcing Vice Adm. Richard C. Gentz,
commander of the Naval Air Systems Command, to retire by next Feb.
1. He also said he was reassigning the executive officer for
tactical aircraft programs, Rear Adm. John F. Calvert, and the A-12
program manager, Capt. Lawrence G. Elberfeld.
   Calvert and Elberfeld also received letters of censure from the
Navy secretary, although Garrett said he would not stop Elberfeld's
scheduled promotion to rear admiral.
   Gentz's office today released a statement he wrote for his
employees in which the three-star admiral said it was ``with
sincere regret'' that he leaves the Navy, in which he has served
since 1957.
   ``The NAVAIR team is strong, totally competent, and most of all
has the necessary experience and dedication to meet any challenge
by continuing to work together,'' he wrote.
   Dennis Kline, head of the Naval Air Systems Command public
affairs office, said today that Gentz would not agree to be
interviewed about Garrett's action or the A-12 program.
   An aide in Elberfeld's office said he was out of town and could
not be reached for comment, and an aide to Calvert said the admiral
would not comment.
   A statement issued in Cheney's name Tuesday said he was troubled
by the conclusions of a separate A-12 investigation by the
Pentagon's inpector general. Cheney ordered Deputy Defense
Secretary Donald Atwood to make recommendations for corrective
action when Cheney returns from Europe next week.
   A central theme of both the internal Navy report and the
Pentagon inspector general's investigation is that overly
optimistic cost and schedule estimates of the contractors were not
sufficiently challenged by the government. The reports also said
that official secrecy helped mask the project's problems.
   The Navy report said McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics
contract officials failed to advise the Navy of cost and schedule
problems they knew existed. It said the contract officials felt
pressured by upper management at their companies to avoid making
forecasts of cost or schedule overruns, since such problems would
reduce contract payments to the companies.
   In its report, the inspector general's office cited an instance
in which General Dynamics required government inspectors at the
company's A-12 plant in Fort Worth, Texas, to turn over their notes
to review them for security classification. One set of notes was
lost, and it later was determined that they had contained no secret
information anyway.
   ``We question any procedure by which a contractor obtains access
to, and control over, the work product of government personnel
engaged in oversight duties,'' the report said.
   The inspector general was highly critical of the role of John A.
Betti, the undersecretary of defense for acquisition. It said he
put too much credence in assurances by the contractors that the
project could be completed on time and within the cost ceiling, and
that he dismissed warnings by lower-level Pentagon officials that
the project was encountering serious problems.
   ``We find Mr. Betti's failure especially troublesome in view of
a prior warning within the (Office of the Secretary of Defense) of
cost growth on the A-12 program,'' Inspector General Susan J.
Crawford wrote.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III told Congress today that
Iraq must ``get out of Kuwait now or risk all.'' Israel issued a
veiled warning to take matters into its own hands if the United
States fails to act.
   Iraq today began processing exit permits for more than 3,200
Soviet citizens, and Soviet officials said they were willing to
discuss compensation for terminating the Soviets' work contracts,
as Iraq demanded.
   The United States, meanwhile, was preparing to seek more help
from NATO allies in transporting troops to the Persian Gulf, and
the Philippines government increased fuel prices by nearly 50
percent as a result of rising prices brought on by the gulf crisis.
   Baker's appearance before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
came as lawmakers stepped up demands for a role in any decision to
attack Iraqi troops. Many on Capitol Hill have also been pressing
the Bush administration to pledge more time for economic sanctions
to work.
   But Baker told lawmakers the U.N.-imposed embargo ``has had
little, if any, effect'' on Iraq's ``inclination to withdraw.''
   ``Congress and the American people must tell Saddam Hussein in
unmistakable actions and words: `Get out of Kuwait now or risk
all.'''
   President Bush, on a visit to South America, said he disagreed
with those who believe that sanctions should be given up to 18
months to work.
   ``I've not been one who's been convinced that sanctions alone
will bring him (Saddam) to his senses,'' Bush said Tuesday in
Uruguay.
   Bush was wrapping up the trip in Argentina today. In Buenos
Aires, while greeting diplomats at the presidential palace, he was
approached by the Iraqi ambassador to Argentina, Sahib-Hussain
Tahir. A grim-faced Bush gave Tahir a quick, formal handshake
without exchanging a word.
   In Israel, there was increasing concern about how firmly the
United States was prepared to act against Iraq.
   An Israeli newspaper, Haaretz, said today that Israel has
tacitly warned the United States that it will feel free to deal
with the Iraqi military threat if the United States doesn't.
   Israeli officials said the report ``went too far,'' but stressed
they were watching Bush's latest diplomatic moves in the gulf
``very carefully.''
   Iraq has accepted Bush's offer to send Baker to Baghdad and to
receive Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz in Washington.
   On the timing of that meeting, a member of the Palestine
Liberation Organization's executive committee, Yasser Abed-Rabbo,
told Radio France Internationale today that Bush would meet with
Aziz on Dec. 17.
   White House spokesman Bill Harlow said no specific date had been
set for the Aziz meeting. Bush had said it would take place the
week of Dec. 10.
   Meanwhile, oil prices fell and stocks rallied on a report that
Iraq is willing to withdraw from Kuwait if allowed to keep a
disputed section of a border-straddling oil field.
   Britain's Sky television news said Saddam was proposing to
relinquish all of Kuwait but the southern end of the Rumailah oil
field.
   Iraq's ambassador to the United States, Mohammed al-Mashat, was
asked today about the British report.
   ``I haven't heard that, but all I can say is negotiations
involve give and take. I let you conclude what it means,'' he said
in an interview on CBS.
   The Bush administration has been under mounting pressure from
Congress not to act unilaterally in the Persian Gulf. House
Democrats voted 177-37 in caucus Tuesday for a non-binding
resolution telling Bush he must first get permission from Congress
before sending troops into battle.
   The administration is also seeking dismissal of a lawsuit by 54
Democratic members of Congress that seeks an injunction forcing
Bush to seek congressional approval before attacking Iraqi forces.
The resolution calls for the authorization ``except to protect
American lives from imminent endangerment.''
   Lawyers for the plaintiffs argued Tuesday the U.S. District
court in Washington should tell the president not be ``snubbing his
nose'' at Congress.
   The U.N.-ordered trade embargo has cut off most of Iraq's oil
exports and imports of food and weapons.
   In Moscow, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman said Moscow was
willing to discuss compensation payments for Iraq for allowing
Soviet citizens to leave before their work contracts expired.
   ``If there are going to be costs, we are prepared to bear those
costs because we feel that the security and well-being of our
citizens should come first,'' Churkin said.
   A Soviet diplomat in Baghdad said more than 200 exit visas were
issued today, and some freed Soviets were to fly out on Thursday.
   Economic effects of the gulf crisis are being felt far beyond
Iraq.
   Philippines President Corazon Aquino's government today raised
fuel prices by more than 45 percent because of the soaring cost of
crude oil. Long gas lines formed in the hours before the price
inrease took effect.
   Word that the United States will seek troop-transport help came
from a U.S. official in Brussels, who said today that Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney will ask NATO allies for more help during a
two-day meeting starting Thursday.
   The official cited a need for planes and ships to bring more
American troops and their gear to the gulf, for help in
transporting U.S. troops through European ports, and also for more
chemical-warfare protective gear.

<HEAD>Deadline Set for EC Proposal to Cut Agriculture Subsidies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Community was given a
deadline of noon Thursday to draw up a new proposal for sharper
cuts in agriculture subsidies that would rescue deadlocked world
trade talks, officials said today.
   Uruguayan Foreign Minister Hector Gros Espiell imposed the
deadline after a series of meetings to try to find a way to move
forward the stalled Uruguay Round of trade negotiations.
   The negotiations, kicked off in 1986 in the Uruguayan resort of
Punta del Este, are designed to overhaul world trade in 15 areas,
including agriculture, manufactured goods, textiles and services,
such as telecommunications, transportation and banking.
   They are sponsored by the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, the world trade regulatory body.
   But the European Community's hard-line opposition to cuts in
farm subsidies has threatened the 107-nation Uruguay Round, the
most wide-ranging attempt ever to reduce trade barriers.
   In response to the deadline, EC trade negotiators gave differing
signals as to how flexible Europe was prepared to be on the farming
issue.
   ``We're ready to move by noon tomorrow,'' said Hugo Paemen, a
senior negotiator for the 12-nation trading bloc. ``The EC is
discussing new agriculture proposals as well as proposals in other
areas.''
   But Ray MacSharry, the community's top farm official who has
been among the most intransigent negotiators, said: ``Our degree of
flexibility is minimal.''
   ``A lot of contracting partners need to rethink, not just the
European Community. The EC cannot be expected to give in on
everything,'' he told reporters.
   The talks stalled Tuesday amid heavy pressure from the United
States and other countries to substantially reduce subsidies for
European farmers, who are among the world's most heavily
subsidized.
   In October, the United States proposed cuts in farm subsidies
ranging from 75 percent to 90 percent over the next decade. Export
subsidies designed to promote sales overseas were targeted for the
deepest slashes.
   The European Community so far has offered to snip only 30
percent from subsidies for major crops over 10 years, beginning in
1986. Some reductions already have been made, prompting U.S.
critics to contend that much less than 30 percent would occur in
the next five years.
   France and Germany have been the most resistant to deep cuts in
farm supports. The German government had been worried about the
farmers' vote in last Sunday's elections.
   Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke said today he was
``imploring'' German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President
Francois Mitterrand ``to inject the political will and the courage
which is obviously necessary to prevent a debacle in these
negotiations.''
   There have been hints of cracks in the community's position
opposing any but the most modest reductions. Britain, the
Netherlands and, surprisingly, Germany have urged more flexibility.
   The Uruguay Round is the eighth in a series of negotiating
sessions since World War II designed to reduce barriers to world
trade.
   The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was established in
1947 as a forum for promoting free trade.

   Democratic Mayor Loni Hancock edged her
moderate challenger by 590 votes, but her apparent victory could be
reversed if a judge allows some late absentee ballots to be
counted.
   Challenger Fred Weekes, also a Democrat, is asking a judge to
allow the counting of mail-in ballots postmarked before the polls
closed but not received until after Election Day on Tuesday.
   ``There are a large number of uncounted ballots out there,''
Weekes said. ``I don't know how large, but it could change the
outcome.''
   Weekes, 65, a city councilman, trailed Hancock 16,682 to 16,092
in the non-partisan race, but led 2,403 to 1,624 among early
absentee ballots.
   Malcom Bernstein, a spokesman for Hancock, said he was confident
she would retain her victory.
   A hearing was set for Friday to hear arguments on the late
absentee ballots. An election code says absentee ballots may be
counted only if received by Election Day.
   The runoff was necessary because Hancock, 50, failed to get more
than 50 percent of the vote in a three-way race on Nov. 6. She fell
38 votes short out of 44,339 cast.

<HEAD>Regulator Says Lincoln Was `Probably the Worst'</HEAD>

   The so-called Keating Five senators applied
pressure on regulators in support of ``probably the worst
institution in America,'' Charles H. Keating Jr.'s Lincoln Savings
and Loan, a federal regulator said today.
   William K. Black, testifying before the Senate Ethics
Committee's public hearings, asserted that one result of the
senators' pressure was to delay enforcement actions against Lincoln
- ultimately leading to greater losses for taxpayers.
   Black described as improper a request that one of the senators,
Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, made in a disputed April 9, 1987
meeting the senators held with regulators.
   DeConcini asked the regulators to waive a rule that would limit
Lincoln's ability to make direct investments, and would have the
effect of exposing the thrift to direct regulatory control.
   ``This is an institution that is probably the worst institution
in America, and instead of people trying to help bring it under
control, five U.S. senators were pushing us in the opposite
direction,'' Black said. ``It was startlingly the wrong
direction.''
   Black, a senior deputy counsel with the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board, generally supported the earlier testimony of two other
regulators that DeConcini, an Arizona Democrat, sought to have the
regulators waive a rule limiting Lincoln's ability to make risky
direct investments, and that he used the word ``we,'' suggesting he
was speaking for all the senators.
   None of the other senators said they differed, he said.
   But Black went beyond previous testimony to assert that he
believed political pressure from the senators led to later actions
by the bank board that allowed Lincoln to significantly expand its
junk bonds and direct investments.
   ``This led to greatly increased losses for the (federal)
insurance fund initially, and the taxpayers eventually,'' he said.
   Black's testimony touched off a flurry of objections from
defense attorneys for some of the five senators.
   ``We had found a massive violation of a rule that was vital to
safety and soundness (of the institution), and we were being asked
not to take any enforcement action and to allow that violation to
continue,'' Black said.
   ``I felt it was intimidating and I felt Charles Keating had
clearly set up the meetings to be intimidating,'' Black said.
   Under questioning by special counsel Robert S. Bennett, Black
described a disputed April 9, 1987 meeting he and three other
federal regulators held with the five senators under scrutiny.
   Black said the regulators had found massive problems at Lincoln,
including the use of an accounting ``scam'' to produce paper
profits and send big dividends to a parent shell company run by
Keating, his family and associates.
   Regulators had also found evidence of ``file-stuffing,'' or the
insertion of phony documents in an attempt to support millions of
dollars in loans, for the benefit of examiners, after the money had
been committed.
   Keating's institution ultimately collapsed and was seized by the
government April 14, 1989. The cost to taxpayers of paying off
insured deposits has been put at more than $2 billion.
   ``We call it a scam,'' Black said. ``I think most people do.''
   Black took detailed notes in the meeting he and three San
Francisco-based regulators held with the five senators.
   The five senators are under investigation for allegations they
improperly intervened with regulators on behalf of Keating at a
time when Keating and his associates were contributing $1.3 million
to their campaigns and causes.
   On Tuesday, M. Danny Wall, former chairman of the old Federal
Home Loan Bank Board, said he called Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.,
to tell him when California-based Lincoln was seized on April 14,
1989.
   ``He said something to the effect, `I think the board has made a
mistake. I hope you are right,''' Wall said.
   The regulator said he responded, ``We had no choice.''
   Bennett has used Black's notes to corroborate regulators'
testimony that one of the senators, Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.,
offered the government a deal in return for concessions for
Keating.
   Wall said he called Cranston after the senator had contacted him
four times in three months on Keating's behalf, and several other
times over three years.
   It was an unusual degree of involvement by a senator in the
affairs of one institution, Wall said. But he contended it was not
improper.
   Besides Cranston and DeConcini, the senators under scrutiny are
Republican John McCain of Arizona and Democrats John Glenn of Ohio
and Donald Riegle of Michigan.
   Wall testified that DeConcini contacted him at least twice ad
Cranston four times to urge that regulators permit Keating's thrift
to be sold rather than taken over by the government.
   Two years before the seizure, in the meeting where Black took
notes, regulators told the senators that criminal referrals on
Lincoln were being forwarded to the Justice Department. Testimony
in the hearings has shown that only Cranston and DeConcini
contacted the bank board after that.
   The two senators have said they contacted Wall about a sale
because they were trying to save jobs at Lincoln and its parent
company, American Continental Corp.
   Wall said Cranston urged ``prompt consideration and approval of
any legitimate proposals'' for the sale of Lincoln, while DeConcini
sought prompt consideration but did not urge approval of any
proposal.
   He said he did not recall discussing the details of any of the
proposals with the senators.
   All three proposed buyers were rejected because they were not
``arms-length'' transactions and Keating was involved on both sides
of the deal, Wall said. None of the proposed deals would make
Lincoln economically viable, he said.
   Under questioning by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., an ethics panel
member, Wall said none of the senators pressured him.

<HEAD>Reagan: Gorbachev Might Resort to Martial Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Reagan said today
that Sovie President Mikhail S. Gorbachev might resort to martial
law to prevent his country's economic crisis from leading to
anarchy.
   Describing Gorbachev as a friend, ``and a friend in need,''
Reagan said Gorbachev is torn between people who want to move
faster on reforms and entrenched bureaucrats who are blocking his
path.
   ``With production and the Soviet gross national product
declining, will the people be patient long enough for the reforms
to work? We must hope so, for the alternatives are not desirable,''
Reagan said.
   ``It is conceivable that President Gorbachev will feel the need
to invoke some of his more drastic powers, using the army and the
KGB to impose and maintain martial law,'' Reagan said.
   ``If he does so, I believe it would not be from some power-mad
impulse, but rather from a belief that such an action would be the
only way to save his nation from instability.''
   Reagan, making the only public address of his five-day visit in
England, spoke at the Cambridge Union debating society. He was
warmly received by more than 500 students and faculty.
   ``If the peaceful-transition scenario does not succeed and if
the martial law scenario is played out and fails to push the
transition forward, the so-called worse case may result. This would
involve chaos, civil strife, perhaps anarchy and widespread famine.
The spill-over from such an upheaval would become everyone's
business.
   ``There would be millions of starving refuges and there would be
uncertainty about the control of the remaining nuclear weapons
deployed about the Soviet countryside.
   ``For all these reasons we in the West must make every effort to
understand the current transition. We must understand the tension
between and among the various nationalities within the USSR and we
must assist the people of that vast land in making the transition
to democracy and a market economy as peacefully as possible,'' he
said.
   A few demonstrators were outside the debating chamber, two of
them protesting U.S. policy in Guatemala. One student had a grocery
shopping cart rigged up with a bicycle wheel strung with tinsel
labeled ``Reagan's brain.''
   Inside, however, Reagan was greeted with a burst of applause as
he slowly walked in, nodding to the main floor and the jammed
galleries.

   Women are twic as likely as men to experience
depression, a major public health problem that costs the United
States $16 billion a year, officials said today.
   The American Psychological Association said patterns of
thinking, physical and sexual abuse, poverty and unhappy marriages
are all woven into a complex tapestry that puts women at double the
risk for depression.
   Bonnie Strickland, an Amherst professor of psychology and past
president of the APA, called depression ``a major public health
problem'' that costs the country about $16 billion a year and leads
to about 30,000 suicides a year.
   ``Unfortunately, it's often not recognized and untreated,''
Strickland said at a news conference.
   The pattern of depression, she said, seems to be occurring more
and more often among young adults, shifting away from the
middle-aged who were once the major victims. And though depression
occurs at some time in the life in one out of every eight men, the
disorder strikes 25 percent of all women, Strickland said.
   A three-year study by a committee of experts organized by the
APA found that at least 7 million American women suffer from
depression and that most will go untreated, often with ``tragic,
unnecessary losses'' such as suicide.
   ``Women truly are more depressed than men primarily due to their
experience of being female in our contemporary culture,'' Ellen
McGrath, chairwoman of the National Task Force on Women and
Depression, said in a statement prepared for a news conference
today.
   The study said more research is essential to determine why women
are so vulnerable to the ailment, how best to treat it and how best
to help women protect themselves from the dangers of profound
depression.
   McGrath said the task force found that women of all races, ages
and income levels - in Europe,Africa and North America - are all at
higher risk than men for most types of depression. And, said
McGrath, the reason is not that women are more apt to admit their
feelings.
   ``It is astonishing how often this difference is denied by
assuming that women more readily report emotional distress than
men,'' she said. ``This argument says women are not really more
depressed, they just say and think so.''
   The report by the task force said a number of social, economic,
biological and emotional factors raise the risk of depression for
women. Consequently, the experts said, women and their depression
should be studied in a ``biopsychosocial context'' that recognizes
the varied effects of gender differences in all these factors.
   Among the task force findings:
   -Biology is not as strong an influence in women's depression as
previously believed. Menstruation, pregnancy, abortion and
menopause are not major factors in significant depression for most
women. Infertility is, however, with up to 40 percent of women
studied saying the inability to conceive is ``the most upsetting
experience of their lives.''
   -Depression in women may be related to gender-related
personality styles that include passive, dependent patterns and
negative thinking, but this requires more research.
   ``The research suggests women focus too much on discussing
depressed feelings instead of developing action and mastery
strategies,'' McGrath said.
   -Abuse early in life may play a large role. The study said that
between 37 percent and half of all women have had ``a significant
experience of physical or sexual abuse before the age of 21.'' For
many women, depression may be the result of post-traumatic stress
syndrome or even undiagnosed head trauma from battering.
   -Unhappy marriages and parenthood are important factors. The
study said women are three times more likely than men to be
depressed in unhappy marriages, and that having young children
around creates a vulnerability to depression. ``The more children
in the house, the more depression is reported,'' the study said.
   -The report called poverty a ``pathway to depression.'' It said
that 75 percent of the U.S. poor are women and children.
   -Some groups of women are particularly susceptible, the report
said. These include minority, elderly, chemically dependent,
lesbian and professional women. It said these ``need special
attention and support.''
   Although depression now readily yields to treatment in 80 to 90
percent of all patients, most women with the ailment go untreated,
the report said. And for those who are treated, the depression is
misdiagnosed ``at least 30 to 50 percent of the time,'' it said.
   ``Approximately 70 percent of the prescriptions for
antidepressants are given to women, often with improper diagnosis
and monitoring,'' the study said. It recommended more research on
the use of antidepressant drugs for women.
   The APA task force included 34 women and five men. The group
included psychologists, physicians, mental health workers, authors
and editors, and Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo.

United States and abroad.

   Nov. 29
   The Westerly (R.I.) Sun on the Persian Gulf:
   It would be impossible to imagine that the Bush administration
did not know what it was doing when it chose or agreed to Jan. 15
as D-Day in the Persian Gulf.
   Jan. 15 is the day by which Saddam Hussein must remove his
patriots from Kuwait or see the Middle East explode into a cauldron
of disaster. ...
   But Jan. 15 is a day with more than passing importance in the
United States. In fact, the choice of Jan. 15 as a date of
ultimatum for war could hardly have been more ironic.
   Jan. 15 is Martin Luther King Day. Martin Luther King Jr. was
America's Gandhi. More than any other patriot, he represents
non-violent confrontation and the peaceful resolution of nearly
irreconcilable differences. It was his disarming technique of
aggression that ended the timeless supremacy of institutional
racism in the South.
   To supplant this day of peace with a day celebrating the threat
of annihilation by fire is an injustice and a terribly sad
commentary on the times. It does not bode well for a peaceful
solution to the invasion of Kuwait.

   Dec. 2
   The Flint (Mich.) Journal on the Persian Gulf:
   (I)t is our hope that (the) United Nations Security Council
resolution authorizing the use of force against Iraq will result in
peace, not war.
   President Bush has done the right thing in securing the world's
approval for the use of force, should that option become necessary.
We strongly support the resolution because we believe that if
Saddam Hussein understands anything, it is force. ...
   Still, we remain convinced that force should be used against
Iraq only when it is clear all other non-violent options have been
exhausted. And so, we applaud President Bush's announcement ... to
send Secretary of State James Baker III to Iraq and his invitation
to Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz to come to Washington for
consultations. ...
   The biggest potential problem we have with the U.N. resolution
is its deadline. We understand the need for a deadline. The world
cannot go on tolerating Saddam's belligerence forever. He has
already defiantly ignored 10 previous U.N. resolutions demanding
Iraq's unconditional and immediate withdrawal from Kuwait and
release of all hostages.
   But just because the U.N. resolution allows the use of force
after Jan. 15, we hope the Bush administration does not interpret
that to mean the United States must or even should initiate war on
Jan. 16.

   The Union Leader, Manchester, N.H., on the Persian Gulf:
   As we face the stalemate in the Middle East, has the time come
to consider use of our ultimate weapon, that is, the nuclear
weapon?
   If it is determined that the sole means of ridding the world of
Saddam Hussein's own nuclear threat is through force, then ... it
would be foolish not to consider the most effective and life-saving
means of that force. ...
   Nuclear weapons saved thousands of lives that would have been
lost in a protracted war against the Japanese. ...
   Some will think this an ugly solution, but then, war is ugly in
itself. A lengthy war, which would spill the blood of American boys
across the desert sands, would be the ugliest of all.

   Dec. 2
   Wilmington (N.C.) Sunday Star-News on the Persian Gulf:
   President Bush doesn't have the patience to strangle Saddam
Hussein. He is risking war instead.
   He is risking war even though public support for war is
dwindling and some top military experts say it might not be
necessary; that given a year or so, the blockade of Iraq could
force Saddam out of Kuwait.
   That was supposed to have been the plan when the president sent
our young people to the gulf in late summer. They were sent to keep
Sddam from overrunning Saudi Arabia.
   The refusal of other countries to trade with Iraq was going to
bankrupt and starve Saddam into submission.
   It might have worked. There's reason to think the American
people would have had the patience to sit it out. Considering the
bloody alternative, a long wait isn't such a bad thing. ...
   The president got the United Nations Security Council to approve
a resolution authorizing Americans to die, possibly by the tens of
thousands, for the New World Order.
   If Congress were willing to play its proper role, it would be
stampeding back to Washington to let the president know he has
sprinted too far out on the limb that has us all on it.
   But with the exception of Sen. Sam Nunn and a few others, most
lawmakers, Democrats and Republicans alike, lack the nerve to
oppose the president. Not that many of them are keen on supporting
him, you understand. They'd rather lie low and hope they won't get
blamed for whatever happens.
   ---
   Dec. 1
   Albany (Ore.) Democrat-Herald on the Persian Gulf:
   The Bush administration ... was wondering whether to call
Congress into session on the Persian Gulf situation. It should do
so without delay.
   Congress should be asked to act on a resolution that would
authorize the use of force against Iraq unless that country meets
certain conditions. One condition would be the release of all
American hostages by a deadline. Another would be complete
withdrawal from Kuwait.
   Such a resolution would not be the same as a declaration of war,
but it would be close enough.
   As commander-in-chief, the president has the power to move
troops and even to amass units in Saudi Arabia, as he has done. But
there's grave doubt whether he can send them into battle without
congressional consent when the United States is not under attack
and there is no other emergency.
   Congress often comes across as a collection of craven kooks.
Still, it's part of our constitutional government and has a role to
play. The Security Council of the United Nations has authorized the
use of force if Iraq doesn't leave Kuwait by Jan. 15. This is
helpful from the standpoint of diplomacy, but a U.N. resolution
means zip when it comes to the American Constitution.
   If Iraq attacks, our units in Saudi Arabian need no act of
Congress to defend themselves. But if it's our side that shoots
first, congressional action is required before the bloodshed
starts.

<HEAD>Deputy Parliament Chairman Is Likely New Premier</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The independent deputy chairman of
Parliament is likely to head a new coalition government following
the resignation of Premier Andrei Lukanov's Socialist Cabinet,
Parliament sources said today.
   A tentative agreement on Ginyo Ganev was said to have been
reached in consultations between the majority Socialists and
opposition parties.
   The talks were aimed at forming a new government and
establishing a timetable for future parliamentary work and a new
constitution.
   The accord ``is complete except for a few editorial changes,''
Bulgarian radio quoted an informed source in Parliament as saying.
   According to the broadcast, the document also specifies the
distribution of ministries between the Socialists and opposition
parties and the dates of regional and parliamentary elections.
   According to sources who spoke on condition of anonymity, most
of the participants in the ongoing consultations on the government
were said to have favored Ganev to head a new ``national government
of peaceful transition.''
   Other candidates mentioned were two independent university
professors, Blagovest Sendov and Petar Dinekov.
   The new Cabinet is to include three deputy premiers and 11
ministers for a total of 15 government posts, down from 22 in the
Lukanov government.
   Meanwhile, the Union of Democratic Forces, the main opposition
alliance, prepared for a crucial weekend meeting in Plovdiv,
Bulgaria's second-largest city, that may elect a new chairman.
   The conference, earlier scheduled for Dec. 15-16, was moved up
after Petar Beron, the 16-party Union's chairman, was accused of
links with the former hard-line Communist regime under ousted
strongman Todor Zhivkov.
   Beron, speaking from Budapest, acknowledged in a radio interview
Tuesday that he had worked as a police informer, informing on
foreign visitors to the Museum of Natural History, while heading
the museum's international relations department in the 1980s.
   News analysts in Sofia said the most likely successor to Beron
is Dimitar Ludzhev, one of Beron's deputies who is also acting as
an adviser to President Zhelyu Zhelev. Zhelev was Beron's
predecessor as opposition leader before becoming head of state.

   Delaware County Daily Times, Chester, Pa., on Middle East
hostages:
   ``A nation that chooses not to pursue freedom for an innocent
captive resigns its own freedom. Those who choose not to listen
will themselves cry out and never be heard.'' ...
   This excerpt was taken from a postcard, one of about 450,000
that were mailed to the White House as part of a campaign to show
the administration that the American public cares about hostages
and hostage-taking should not be tolerated. ...
   But these cards were not intended to address the current hostage
situation.
   The cards were mailed in 1989 - a year before the average Joe
ever heard about Saddam Hussein and what a madman he is. The
postcard campaign was intended to rekindle the passions across the
land when Americans first became targets of terrorist attacks.
   The cards were meant to reignite hope for the other hostages.
   Our country has all but forgotten Terry Anderson, who has been
held captive in the Middle East since March 16, 1985.
   We can only vaguely remember him and the other lost hostages:
Joseph James Cicippio, ... who has been held hostage since Sept.
12, 1986; Thomas Sutherland, who was captured June 9, 1985; Edward
Austin Tracy, Oct. 21, 1986; Jesse Turner, Jan. 24, 1987; Alann
Steen, also Jan. 24, 1987. ...
   Our fear is that as time goes on, we are likely to get caught up
even more in the ebb and flow of our everyday lives. One day, their
names may not even draw the faintest of recognitions. And then all
hope will be lost.
   God forbid.

   The Clarion-Ledger, Jackson, Miss., on the ``Keating Five'':
   ``Sir, I believe what is on trial here is not the five
colleagues of mine but the U.S. Senate, and for that matter the
Congress of the United States,'' thundered Sen. Daniel Inouye (at)
... the ``Keating Five'' hearings. ...
   What he said is true, but it should not, as Inouye did, be said
in ``defense'' of the so-called Keating Five.
   Those who defend the five senators say the line between helping
a constituent and taking a bribe is very slim.
   That may be true, too. Like the difference between good and
evil, life and death, right and wrong.
   It's another way in which the words and actions of our elected
representatives don't jibe with the common citizen. ...
   And until the campaign finance laws are reformed to make the
average American's voice louder than the fat cat's cash, the
language of our politicians will not reflect the voice of the
American people.

   Los Angeles Daily News on taxes and the airline industry:
   Those new tax increases devised by Congress and President Bush
to cut the federal deficit have begun to bite, and now we're
waiting for the payoff. ... Businesses and consumers still act as
if they expect things to get worse before they get better. ...
   Taxes on airline tickets ... went up 2 percent. ... By itself,
this tax hike is modest; it increases the cost of most tickets by
less than $10. ...
   Several carriers are struggling, and the new tax could well act
upon them like a wave of economic influenza, sparing the healthy
but killing the infirm.
   That's the problem with raising taxes even modestly when the
economy is sagging. Many enterprises that would absorb the new cost
easily when business is good don't have the same cushion when sales
are off. ...
   Even before Saddam (Hussein), Congress and Bush made their
economic moves, the airline industry already was in the process of
consolidation, in which the weak were getting weaker and the strong
were swallowing them up. It would seem that the tax increase can
only ... hasten the day when domestic air travel is controlled by
just three or four companies.
   It's not the proper role of government to prop up companies that
can't make a profit. But the government should try not to kick
companies, through taxation or any other means, when they're down.

   Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune on fuel conservation:
   In the interests of fuel conservation, reduced emissions through
more conservation driving habits and better maintenance of our
roads and highways, we have urged higher taxes on gasoline. But it
still hurts when the price of a fill-up goes up.
   Though the price rises associated with the tensions in the
Persian Gulf have not led to less consumption of gasoline, perhaps
the new round of tax increases will prompt drivers to plan their
trips more carefully, car pool when possible, break out bicycles
and break in new walking shoes.
   Americans may even take a sharper look at their gas guzzlers,
comparing their efficiency to the promised economy of smaller cars.
   If Americans respond to the tax rises by conserving and using
fuel more wisely, we can make progress toward a more responsible
energy policy. But even proponents of the gasoline taxes will feel
the sting when we fill up our tanks.

   The Reporter, Fond du Lac, Wis., on Cosby vs. Simpson:
   The news probably brought out some cheering and sneering, along
with sighs and maybe even cries. That bad boy brat, Bart Simpson,
edged out a rerun of the Cosby Show by three-tenths of a point. ...
   Now that the two television shows are on opposite each other
Thursday nights ..., the choice is clear. ...
   Viewers of The Simpsons take delight in the antics of cartoon
character Bart Simpson, and both youngsters and young adults see
great humor in his ill-mannered actions and insolent attitude.
   Cos watchers find Bart a disrespectful brat with offensive
behavior, as opposed to the clean-cut, wholesome Cosby family which
is sure to end its show on the right side of everything. ...
   Seeing this as a battle between good and evil is really going to
an extreme. It's too much to consider it a battle between young
iconoclasts and old conservatives.
   It's simply a matter of good taste. Given the choice of only
those two programs, good taste should make the choice easy.

   Athens (Ohio) Messenger on China:
   It's one of the paradoxes of totalitarian regimes that they
empty language of all objective meaning and yet employ words to
send subtle, and often sinister, messages to the people they
repress. That's why a recent evening newscast in China carried
ominous implications.
   Since the early days of China's ``liberalization'' in the late
1970s, television news anchors have opened their shows with
``Viewers, hello!'' Earlier (last) month, the program began:
``Comrades, hello!''
   The dread ``c''-word, symbol of coerced solidarity and phony
totalitarian chumminess, had largely fallen from official usage.
Its reappearance is taken by many Chinese as a sign that reigning
hard-liners want to reassert their control not only of political
institutions but also of social custom.
   A small matter, perhaps, but looking through the distorting lens
of communism one can never be sure of the gauge of things. It's
safe to say, however, that despite the comradely (so to speak)
efforts of President Bush and his administration, Chinese communism
is as entrenched as ever.

   The Times of India, New Delhi, on Britain's new prime minister:
   Although Britain's new prime minister, ... John Major, is widely
held to be a (Margaret) Thatcher clone, his choice of ... Michael
Heseltine, one of his two rivals for the Tory leadership, as
environment secretary suggests he has a mind of his own.
   True, the appointment can be seen as a way of bringing ...
Heseltine down a notch or two by filling a relatively minor slot -
one, moreover, which would test his commitment to reviewing the
controversial community poll tax that Mrs. Thatcher had introduced.
   On the other hand, by making so fierce and consistent a critic
of the tax as ... Heseltine responsible for taking a second look at
it, ... Major is indicating that he is prepared, if necessary, to
undo one of his putative patron's landmark measures. Hardly the
behaviour of a clone! ...
   Major's retention of ... Douglas Hurd as foreign secretary sends
a different signal, one of continuity. This is likely, and may have
been meant, to reassure the Americans who valued Mrs. Thatcher's
support on the (Persian) Gulf crisis very highly and who were
apprehensive that her successor might not be quite as
enthusiastically supportive.

   Dec. 3
   Straits Times, Singapore, on Britain's new prime minister:
   What is important is that (John) Major, a man of humble origins
whose early youth was marked by economic hardship, has risen to the
highest elected office in Britain on his own merits, without the
props of wealth or class.
   He thus exemplifies the social mobility that was accelerated by
the policies of his predecessor, ... Margaret Thatcher, whose views
on most issues he basically shares. ...
   In an important decision, he has promised to review the
so-called poll tax, a controversial levy to fund local services,
whose unpopularity with many Britons could hurt the Conservative
Party's chances in the next general election.
   Notwithstanding this, however, ... Major in effect represents
Thatcherism without Mrs. Thatcher. That element of change within
continuity should be good for Britain, both domestically and
abroad.

   The Independent, London, on the Persian Gulf:
   President Bush said ... that the Iraqi leader ``doesn't
necessarily believe that I am totally committed to what I have been
saying.''
   Why should he? President Saddam (Hussein) has been given little
reason to believe the United States has the will for war.
   The behavior of Congress is undermining the credibility of
Bush's threat of force and is encouraging the Iraqi leader in his
dangerous intransigence.
   When Bush's firm position is subject to sustained attack ... the
effect is to make war more, not less, likely. ...
   Although talks between the United States and Iraq will almost
certainly take place, the situation continues to move closer to
war.

   Dec. 3
   Al-Ahram, Cairo, Egypt, on the Persian Gulf:
   (President George Bush's initiative for talks with Iraq) was a
happy surprise for the proponents of law, legitimacy and peaceful
settlement. ...
   The great majority of peoples reject war and want a peaceful
solution, foremost among them the American people. ...
   But the condemnation of aggression and the restoration of right
and legitimacy are musts that should not be tampered with or
compromised on.

   The U.S. government endorsed the Canadian
findings about a 1985 crash in Gander, Newfoundland, without
consulting the chief federal investigator who looked into the
disaster, according to congressional testimony today.
   George Seidlein testified that the Canadian panel was wrong in
concluding that ice on the wings caused the disaster that killed a
planeload of American servicemen.
   The cause actually was due to the crew trying to force the DC-8
to climb after takeoff before it had accelerated to a high enough
speed, Seidlein told the House Judiciary subcommittee on crime.
   Seidlein was the National Transportation Safety Board's chief
on-site investigator in Gander, but his superiors didn't consult
him on his views of the Canadian findings, which the U.S.
government endorsed.
   By the time Canada reached its conclusions, Seidlein had
transferred to an agency office in Lansing, Mich., and was about to
retire, he testified.
   Seidlein ``wasn't intentionally excluded'' from consultations,
testified Ronald Schleede, the NTSB's investigations chief who was
Seidlein's boss.
   ``Why did you send him up there'' to Gander?'' asked U.S. Rep.
William Hughes, D-N.J. ``Is there a reason you didn't bring him
in?''
   ``No sir,'' replied Schleede.
   On Tuesday, witnesses told the panel the U.S. government has no
reason to suspect a terrorist tie to the crash.
   Within hours of the tragedy, the U.S. military officials readily
accepted Canadian investigators' theory that the chartered DC-8
jetliner went down seconds after takeoff because of ice on its
wings, witnesses told a House hearing Tuesday.
   Several eyewitnesses said Tuesday that they saw a bright light
in the sky just before the crash, and a terrorist group aligned
with Iran claimed responsibility for destroying the jet. Rep. Robin
Tallon, D-S.C., and some families of the victims theorize a
terrorist act connected to the Iran-Contra scandal might have
caused the crash.
   How could Canadian investigators so quickly rule out terrorism
and the U.S. government readily accept the assertion, disbelieving
congressmen asked.
   ``I can't explain that,'' responded L.T. Filotas, a Canadian
aeronautical engineer who dissented from a majority finding of a
Canadian panel that ice on the wings caused the crash.
   The theory of ice on the wings is ``preposterous,'' said
Filotas, who attributed the crash to an in-flight fire possibly
caused by a bomb.
   FBI agents who went to Gander cooled their heels in a local
motel after offering their help to the Canadians, who declined it,
said Rep. Lawrence Smith, D-Fla. The agents went home 36 hours
after they arrived when the Canadians informed them terrorism had
been ruled out, Smith said.
   The FBI told the House panel it has no reason to question the
accuracy of the Canadian findings.
   ``No credible evidence has surfaced'' suggesting the plane crash
was the result of an act of terrorism, Nicholas O'Hara, deputy
assistant director for criminal investigations at the FBI, said in
written testimony.
   Yet the pilot who flew the first leg of the doomed flight, to
Cairo, told the FBI he believed the explosion of a bomb may have
caused the crash, said Tallon. The pilot said an Egyptian guard
assigned to the plane disappeared from his post several times.
   ``The FBI ... found very serious allegations,'' but there is no
record of what the agency did after it received them, said Tallon.
   Tallon wondered whether the FBI and the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police withheld allegations relating to terrorism from the Canadian
panel that looked into the crash.
   The Dec. 12, 1985, tragedy killed 248 members of the Army's
101st Airborne Division coming home from a peacekeeping mission in
the Middle East. All eight crew members on the charter flight of
Miami-based Arrow Air also died.
   Arrow Air was one of the subcontractors that hauled weapons to
the Contra rebels in Nicaragua for Oliver North's secret resupply
network. It operated in 1985 and 1986 during a congressional ban on
U.S. military aid to the guerrillas.
   The Gander crash occurred less than three weeks after the Reagan
administration secretly assisted a shipment of Hawk anti-aircraft
missiles from Israel to Iran as part of the U.S. effort to free
hostages held in Lebanon. The Iranians were outraged and felt they
had been duped because the missiles weren't the kind they wanted.
   Rep. William Hughes, the subcommittee's chairman, asked whether
the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency questioned the Canadians
about the possibility of a terrorist bomb aboard the plane.
   ``I don't know of any inquiries made of the Canadians,'' replied
William Allard, the DIA's general counsel. Hughes, D-N.J., said he
found that ``incomprehensible.''
   Allard said the agency gathers strategic and tactical military
intelligence, rather than doing investigative work.

   A 57-year-old British man held by Iraq at a
strategic site has died in captivity, apparently from a heart
attack, a British Embassy official said today.
   A Foreign Office spokesman in London identified the dead man as
Donald Major. His hometown was not immediately known. The embassy
official said Major died Tuesday at the undisclosed strategic site
where he was being held hostage.
   ``This confirms the underlying need for Iraq to respond to our
appeals for the immediate release of all hostages,'' said the
Foreign office spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   An unidentified colleague released by Iraq informed the embassy
of the death and said the man appeared to die of a heart attack,
said the embassy official, who also spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The official said the man was the first British hostage known to
have died in captivity. Three other Britons died of natural causes
while in hiding in Kuwait and two were killed in a car accident in
October while trying to drive from Kuwait to the Iraq port of
Basra.

<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister David Levy warned Saddam
Hussein today that Israel would ``destroy his security'' if he
tried to use peace moves in the Persian Gulf as a springboard for
an attack on the Jewish state.
   Levy's remarks to Parliament reflected the apparent unease of
Israeli officials at the prospect of a resolution of the gulf
crisis that would leave the Iraqi president's army and missiles
intact.
   ``Israel does not use the same instruments and the same deadly
weapons as Saddam Hussein used against his people and threatens to
use against us,'' Levy said.
   ``But if anyone thinks that through some maneuver in the name of
peace he will be able to continue to threaten with the aim of
surprising Israel, he will find Israel ready, always, with its
might, to destroy his security, to hurt him until he is sorry and
regrets his action,'' Levy said.
   Earlier, a Tel Aviv newspaper said Israel had tacitly warned the
United States that it will feel free to deal with the Iraqi
military threat if the United States doesn't.
   Officials said the report in the daily Haaretz ``went too far,''
but that they were watching President Bush's latest diplomatic
moves in the Persian Gulf ``very carefully.''
   Haaretz said Levy met Tuesday with U.S. Ambassador William Brown
and told him Israel had kept a low profile on the gulf crisis
because it was given to understand that the United States would
confront Iraq's military might.
   ``In this lay a hint that if the United States backs out of its
undertaking, Israel will no longer feel committed to a low-profile
policy, and would react to the Iraqi threat,'' the paper said.
   Iraq has threatened to attack Israel if war breaks out in the
gulf. In the past, it has vowed to use chemical weapons against the
Jewish state, and Israel has distributed gas masks to its citizens.
   Israeli officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Israel expects the United States to abide by all its undertakings,
but added that Israel has not received any official assurance that
Washington will disarm Iraq.
   An official said Israel ``believes'' that once the crisis is
resolved, Iraq will be unable to carry out its threats against
Israel. He then amended ``believes'' to ``hopes.''
   Levy summoned Brown after receiving a message from Secretary of
State James A. Baker III explaining Bush's offer to send Baker to
Baghdad, and receive Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz in
Washington.
   Haaretz said Levy told visiting European dignitaries Tuesday
that Israel would adopt ``the highest profile'' if its existence
was threatened.
   ``These remarks, coupled with the statement to Ambassador Brown,
express a new Israeli policy toward the gulf crisis, following the
invitation to Iraq to negotiate with the United States,'' Haaretz
said.
   The officials denied Israeli policy had changed.
   Another newspaper, Davar, said Levy's message to Washington was
``sharp.'' It quoted unidentified sources in Jerusalem as saying
this message was ``the most significant'' so far between Washington
and Jerusalem on the gulf crisis.
   Davar said Israel regarded the United States' official goals in
the gulf to be Iraq's withdrawal and the restoration of the ousted
Kuwaiti rgime, but also believed it had ``unofficial goals -
including, in Israel's opinion, the disarming of Iraq, including
nuclear facilities.''

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dangerous habit of sniffing butane and propane
gas to get high appears to be growing among affluent adolescents
and may even approach epidemic levels, two health experts warn.
   In a letter published in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine, they described two cases in Cincinnati in which boys died
suddenly while sniffing gas. Both occurred within a six-week period
this year in middle-class neighborhoods.
   Doctors have known about ``sudden sniffing death'' since at
least 1970, but such deaths are rarely reported in the United
States.
   They said they suspect that ``abuse of these readily available
inhalants has reached epidemic proportions, indicating an urgent
need for preventive efforts directed at teen-agers and their
parents, with an emphasis on the risk of sudden death from
sniffing.''
   The gases can kill by triggering cardiac arrest. The warning was
contained in a letter written by pharmacist Earl Siegel and Dr.
Suman Wason of Children's Hospital Medical Center in Cincinnati.
   They said that in March, an 11-year-old boy was found collapsed
in the a movie theater bathroom, along with a plastic bag and a
container of butane lighter fuel. Efforts to revive him failed, and
traces of butane were found in the boy's blood and lungs.
   Six weeks later, a 15-year-old boy lost consciousness while
playing with propane taken from a back yard gas grill. He and
friends inhaled the gas and also engaged in ``torch breathing'' -
blowing out the gas and lighting it. He died on his way to the
hospital, and traces of propane also were found in his body.
   ``Interviews with friends and school officials about the boy in
the first case revealed that the sniffing of butane lighter fuel
was common among many children at their upper middle-class school
in Cincinnati,'' they wrote.

<HEAD>German Government Has Had No Contact With Soviets Over Honecker</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The German and Soviet governments have not
discussed what to do with deposed East German Communist leader
Erich Honecker, who is in a Soviet military hospital outside
Berlin, an official said Wednesday.
   Hans Klein, chief spokesman for Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
government, told reporters the matter was being handled by
authorities in Berlin. They brought manslaughter charges against
Honecker last week for the shoot-to-kill orders once directed at
East Germans trying to flee to the West.
   Honecker's fate is one of the first thorny issues facing Bonn
and Moscow since the two governments signed several treaties on
Soviet troop withdrawals, German-Soviet cooperation and
non-aggression.
   Klein insisted the federal government had no role in Honecker's
case.
   ``We have a united German law, and the justice senator in Berlin
and the justice minister in Brandenburg are in charge,'' he said.
``The government never puts pressure on the administration of
justice.''
   The spokesman also ducked a question on whether the Soviet
military had any legal right in the new, united Germany to hide a
German citizen from German authorities.
   Klein said no one was hiding Honecker because everyone knew
where he was.
   German police must have permission from the Soviets to enter the
hospital in a Soviet military compound in Beelitz, a town 20 miles
south of Berlin, to arrest Honecker.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Vitaly Churkin said in Moscow
on Monday that Honecker was staying at the hospital for
humanitarian reasons.
   A Berlin court last Friday issued an arrest warrant for
Honecker, 78, on manslaughter charges in the shoot-to-kill orders
issued to East German guards at the now-fallen Berlin Wall and
inner German border.
   Honecker has denied all the charges against him, including that
he was personally responsible for the estimated 200 people who died
trying to escape his repressive government.
   Honecker's lawyers have said their client is too ill to stand
trial. Media reports earlier this year said Honecker was suffering
from kidney cancer, but German television has broadcast pictures of
a fit-looking Honecker walking the grounds of the hospital.

<TEXT>
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
will send a special envoy to Israel later this week to discuss the
Palestinian problem, a senior U.N. official said Wednesday.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Jean-Claude Aime would go to Israel as soon as the Security Council
concludes its work on an occupied territories resolution.
   The council took up that resolution Wednesday. Yemeni Ambassador
Abdalla Saleh al-Ashtal, who chairs the council this month, said a
vote is expected Thursday.
   The PLO-backed resolution would establish a U.N.-appointed
ombudsman to monitor Israel's treatment of the Palestinians.
   It would also endorse the idea of calling a meeting of the 164
nations that signed the Fourth Geneva Convention to pressure Israel
- itself a signatory - to accept the accords as applicable in the
occupied territories.
   The Geneva Convention forbids military forces from attacking
civilians under occupation, even in self-defense, and outlaws
deportations and collective punishment, two tactics Israel has used
to try to break the Palestinian uprising.
   Perez de Cuellar had been holding off sending Aime until the
council finished its work.
   Aime goes to Israel as part of a compromise in which Israel
agreed to receive him if it was understood that he would not be
investigating the Oct. 8 Temple Mount shootings, in which Israeli
police killed 17 Palestinians.
   Israeli officials said the Palestinians were stoning Jews at the
Western Wall below, and said the police fired in self-defense.
   Israel contends that accepting a U.N. inquiry into an event in
Jerusalem would call into question its sovereignty over the city,
which it has made its capital.
   The Jewish state captured the eastern Arab sector of the city
from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war, and later annexed it. Most
nations reject Israel's claim to east Jerusalem.

<HEAD>Government to Lift Ban on Donations by Haitians</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government said today it will lift its ban
on blood donations by Haitians and will intensify efforts to screen
heterosexuals who pose a risk of transmitting AIDS.
   ``The strengthened program will enhance, rather than replace,
the current procedures used to safeguard the blood supply,'' said
Health Secretary Louis W. Sullivan. The changes will be phased in
by the Food and Drug Administration, an agency of the Department of
Health and Human Services.
   ``By shifting the focus of screening procedures to cover a
broader range of risk factors, FDA will build upon the safety of
the blood supply while providing all healthy and willing
individuals the opportunity to donate blood.''
   Haitians had protested the ban as discriminatory, and a federal
advisory panel last spring said the policy should be ended. HHS
spokesman Brad Stone said the rescission follows the work of that
Blood Products Advisory Committee.
   HHS also will ease the ban on blood donations by black Africans
where testing for the form of the AIDS virus found in sub-Saharan
Africa is available.
   ``The most important thing they need to do now is remove the
stigma,'' said Dr. Jean-Claude Compas, a Brooklyn, N.Y., family
practitioner and chairman of the Haitian Coalition on AIDS.
   ``Almost every single medical book in this country has Haitians
associated with AIDS,'' he said, even though there is no
association between any disease and national origin.
   ``It was very traumatic to Haitians and particularly to Haitian
youngsters,'' said Joseph Etienne, director of the Haitian Center
Council in Queens, N.Y. He said the Food and Drug Administration
informed him of the decision this morning.
   New York, with 400,000, and Miami, with 100,000, have the
highest population of Haitian emigres in the United States, he
said.
   In place of the ban, all prospective blood donors will be
required to answer written and oral questions about high-risk
behavior. About 9 million people give blood each year.
   The ban had been imposed early in the epidemic because
scientists said at the time they had found high numbers of AIDS
cases transmitted by heterosexual contact among Haitians.
   Scientists and policymakers believed that screening for
high-risk heterosexual contact would be too difficult compared with
screening for drug use or homosexual contact, the chief modes of
transmission among most Americans.
   The policy had originally excluded Haitians who came to this
country after 1977, but it was extended early this year to all
Haitians.
   The change sparked widespread protests among Haitian-Americans
and black African immigrants, who claimed the policy was causing
discrimination in employment and housing.
   Panelists last spring said there were no data to support
excluding Haitians.
   Prospective donors will be asked whether in the last 12 months
they have: had syphilis, gonorrhea or hepatitis; traded money or
drugs for sex; been paid for sex.
   All donated blood is tested for the AIDS virus before it is
used. However, an infected person may not test positive for six
months after contracting the virus.

<HEAD>Productivity Grew Slowly in Third Quarter, Squeeze on Hiring</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American workers' productivity grew at a
mediocre annual rate of 0.2 percent in the July-September period,
while the nation's businesses trimmed the working hours of their
employees, the government said Wednesday.
   Analysts took the 0.2 percent falloff in hours - the first such
decline since 1986 - as a sign that American businesses had been
bracing over the summer for a recession, which many economists
think has taken hold.
   The Labor Department's report did not come as a surprise,
economists said, because many American businesses have implemented
large-scale layoffs in recent months.
   ``There was some cutting because of the expectation there was
trouble down the road,'' said Robert Dederick, chief economist at
the Northern Trust Co. of Chicago.
   Generally, productivity - defined as output per hour of work -
should increase if hours are cut. But that didn't have much of an
impact in the third quarter, largely because the sluggish economy
kept output unchanged, analysts said.
   ``It's hard to make much progress on productivity when output is
sliding out from under your feet. It's sort of a race to keep step
with it, a race we've been losing,'' Dederick said.
   Increased productivity, or getting each worker to produce more
during each hour of work, is considered vital to boosting the
nation's standard of living without inflation.
   The 0.2 percent third quarter increase in non-farm productivity
followed an equally anemic 0.3 percent rise in the second quarter
of 1990. Still, it was better than the 1.3 percent plunge in
productivity during the first quarter of 1990.
   So far this year, productivity has fallen at an annual rate of
0.2 percent.
   ``The economy just isn't going anywhere. The productivity
numbers are extremely weak ... But we know we're in a recession, so
it doesn't come as much of a shock,'' said Michael K. Evans, who
heads an economic forecasting firm in Washington.
   During all of 1989, productivity fell 0.7 percent.
   Before that decline, productivity growth had averaged around 1.4
percent a year for the past several years, better than the 1.2
percent average of the 1970s, but far worse than the 3.3 percent
annual gain posted in the two decades after World War II.
   Wednesday's report provided revised figures on the third quarter
of 1990. The 0.2 percent revised increase was not nearly as big an
improvement as the 1.6 percent rise first reported by the Labor
Department.
   During the July-September period, the number of hours worked in
non-farm sectors edged down 0.2 percent, a slightly bigger decline
than the 0.1 percent decrease first reported. It was the first
falloff in hours worked since 1986.
   Hourly labor costs, a major measure of inflation for businesses,
shot up 4.6 percent in the third quarter, compared with a 5 percent
rise in the second quarter. During all of 1989, hourly labor costs
increased 3.2 percent.
   Unit labor costs, a key gauge of future price inflation, rose
4.4 percent in the third quarter, compared with 4.7 percent in the
second quarter. Last year, unit labor costs increased 3.9 percent
for the year.
   Total business productivity, including farming, rose 0.4 percent
in the third quarter, compared with a 0.6 percent increase in the
second quarter. For all of 1989, business productivity fell 0.5
percent.
   Manufacturing productivity increased much more rapidly than in
the other sectors, climbing at a 5.1 percent seasonally adjusted
annual rate in the third quarter. That was the largest increase
since it rose 6.5 percent in the second quarter of 1987.
   Manufacturing productivity rose 2.6 percent for all of 1989.
   In the third quarter, hours worked in manufacturing fell 1.8
percent, marking the fifth time in the last seven quarters that
hours of people working in manufacturing have fallen.

<TEXT>
   A national committee today recommended a sharp
increase in federal spending on school lunches to provide an
estimated 24 million children with a more healthy diet.
   ``With more single-parent households, more working mothers, and
more children in poverty, school lunches are more important than
ever,'' the Citizens' Commission on School Nutrition said.
   ``For many children, the school lunch has made the difference
between going hungry and being satisfied, between being
undernourished and being well fed,'' the committee said.
   The committee called upon Congress to ``greatly increase'' the
amount spent per student on school lunches but did not say how much
additional money was needed. It said current funding, adjusted for
inflation, is 58 percent of what it was when the program was
started in 1946.
   One of its members, Vivian Pilant, director of school food
services for South Carolina, said it would take at least $200
million to provide a more healthy diet.
   The committee also recommended that Congress mandate that
schools offer only milk with 2 percent or less fat and reduce this
later to 1 percent. It said this is one of the keys to a fat-free
diet.
   The panel urged schools to limit lunches to an average of 35
percent of calories from fat in the next two to four years, and
then to 30 percent of calories.
   The report said a meal of grilled cheese and peas, served with
whole milk, draws 41.4 percent of its calories from fat. This would
be reduced to 37 percent with 1 percent milk and to 34 percent with
skim milk, it said.
   Michael F. Jacobson, executive director of the Center for
Science in the Public Interest, said he believed such legislation
could be passed despite expected opposition from the dairy
industry.
   ``McDonald's service only low-fat 1 percent milk,'' said
Jacobson. ``Can't schools do as well asMcDonald's? I think whole
milk's days are numbered in the school lunch program.''
   The commission was organized by the center, a non-profit
organization that promotes changes in health and environmental
policies.
   Susan Acker, a spokeswoman for the Agriculture Department, said
the department agreed with a number of the commission's
recommendations and had taken or would take steps to implement
them.
   ``In some cases, they would like to see us move more quickly
than we think we will be able to,'' Ms. Acker said.
   She said the department has issued non-binding guidelines
setting a national standard limiting the fat content of Americans'
diet to 30 percent, but believes it ``is going to be a slow
process'' to reach this goal in the school lunch program.

   Gunshots were fired at an Israeli bus in the
occupied West Bank today and at least three people were wounded,
the army and Israeli reports said.
   Military sources said several shots were fired at a bus of
Egged, the national bus company, as it drove on a main thoroughfare
near the Jelazoun refugee camp, north of Ramallah in the West Bank.
   Three civilians were slightly wounded and rushed to Hadassah
Hospital in Jerusalem, the sources said. They gave no further
details.
   The shooting occurred about 6:30 p.m., when most Jewish settlers
in the West Bank return from work in Israel, the national Itim news
agency reported.
   Israeli soldiers began searches in the area, the report said
without elaborating.
   The shooting came after newspapers, quoting army officials,
reported that Palestinians were likely to turn to firearms as their
revolt against Israeli rule of the occupied lands neared its third
anniversary.
   Leaflets distributed by uprising leaders earlier this week urged
Palestinians to attack Israelis ``using any means.''

<HEAD>MCI Announces Safeguards for 900-Number Phone Calling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   MCI Communications Corp. announced guidelines
Wednesday designed to help protect customers from misleading or
fraudulent services on 900-telephone numbers, which it plans to
start offering nationwide on Jan. 1.
   The company said the consumer safeguards will include a $4 cap
on each call to child-oriented 900 services.
   There have been widespread complaints of fraud and deceptive
advertising in the so-called audiotext services industry, which in
just a few years has mushroomed into a billion-dollar annual
business.
   The MCI policies will include:
   -Pre-screening of programs and advertising.
   -Strict guidelines on which companies will be allowed to bill
their services through MCI.
   -An upgraded consumer complaint monitoring and tracking system.
   -A requirement that adult services be placed on a single prefix,
when available, to facilitate blocking requests by customers.
   -Support of regulatory efforts to make free blocking of all 900
numbers available to residential customers.
   ``MCI believes the majority of 900 programs available today
provide valuable information to businesses and consumers,'' said
Eugene Eidenberg, MCI executive vice president. ``However,
aggressive action to combat abuses against consumers is necessary
if the industry is to realize its full potential.''
   MCI, the nation's second largest long-distance company, thus far
has been testing the 900-number services and has offered only
limited commercial availability, said MCI spokeswoman Pam Small.
   Starting Jan. 1, MCI will ``offer our service to an unlimited
number of customers,'' Small said.
   Phone audiotext companies offer popular services such as
weather, sports, theater information, one-way ``chats'' with music
personalities, shopping information, stock quotes and political
pitches to callers to 900 long-distance numbers. Callers typically
receive flat-rate or per-minute charges for the calls on their
phone bills.
   Con artists have found easy pickings in the audiotext business,
levying astounding phone charges in some cases to callers seeking
games of chance, sex talk and easy credit.
   Witnesses before a House hearing in September told of $8,000
phone bills and phony ``Santa Claus'' lines.
   Daniel Clearfield, executive deputy in the Pennsylvania state
attorney general's office, testified that thousands of people
nationwide were being victimized daily by fraudulent or worthless
900-number services.
   He said the industry had the potential to be ``the telemarketing
consumer fraud problem of the 1990s.''
   The hearing focused on legislation by Rep. Bart Gordon, D-Tenn.,
that would impose federal restrictions on the phone audiotext
industry. But the bill, opposed by phone and audiotext industry
representatives as well as a Federal Communications Commission
official, did not get out of committee.
   In October, the National Association of Information Services, a
900-number industry group, issued a ``code of responsibility''
guidelines for its members.

<HEAD>Alert for Military Threats, Ershad Underestimated the People</HEAD>
<HEAD>AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARLEEN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Gen. Hussain Muhammad Ershad,
like the eight men who preceded him as president of Bangladesh,
kept an alert eye on the military in his young, coup-prone nation.
   He should have been watching the civilians, for they were the
ones who ultimately forced him to offer his resignation this week.
   His chief political opponents were two women, known as much for
their animosity toward each other as for their fervent desire to
dump Ershad, the man they called a military dictator. Ershad, like
so many others, found it easy to discount them.
   What he didn't foresee was that the women, Sheik Hasina and
Khaleda Zia - whose speeches rarely offered much substance beyond
``Ershad must go'' - would preside over a movement that exploded
beyond their staged rallies into popular, mass support.
   Ershad's strength was his weakness: He stayed too long.
   In the 19 years since Bangladesh broke away from Pakistan in a
civil war, it has never achieved a transition of power through the
ballot box. But Ershad lasted nearly nine years, far longer than
any of his predecessors, whose terms ranged from a few weeks to
four years and were always replaced by military coups.
   He brought a measure of discipline and stability to an
impoverished nation that sorely needed it. But in the process he
seemed to acquire an arrogant confidence in his own ability to
survive.
   ``Being a military man helped me, because I have a trained mind.
I have organized thinking,'' Ershad said in an interview in late
September. ``That is why I don't make many mistakes.''
   Sipping tea and seated on a brocade-covered, pseudo-antique
chair in his house deep inside Dhaka's military base, Ershad added:
``My offices are organized, computerized. Everything I want is in
my (computer) system ... Politics do not influence my decisions.''
   During the interview, which took place 19 days before Mrs. Zia
and Hasina launched the strikes and protests that would lead to his
retreat from power, Ershad spoke confidently of his ability to win
the presidential elections he had called for June 1991.
   ``And in the next election (after 1991), my vice president will
be the candidate, so I have to find a way to go out,'' he said.
``If I can hand over power peacefully and step down, democracy will
take root.''
   To his credit, after leading a bloodless coup in March 1982,
Ershad did not become the sort of totalitarian leader who often
emerges in developing nations. Human rights activists generally
gave him good marks.
   Political opponents seldom disappeared in Bangladesh or emerged
from detention with marks and tales of torture.
   When demonstrators defied curfews and bans on public protests
this month, Ershad called in the army to support the police and
paramilitary forces. But there was no massive show of force, even
when tens of thousands of people flooded the streets for days in a
row.
   The nationwide death counts for the past week ranged from the
government's claim of six to the opposition's claim of 100.
   Fair elections were another matter. When Ershad resigned from
the army and was elected president in 1986, foreign diplomats and
journalists said the openness with which the ballot boxes were
stuffed was ludicrous. Ironically, long-time political observers
said Ershad had a good chance of winning a fair election because
his opposition was so splintered.
   Although Bangladesh's 110 million people have a per capita
income of barely $170 a year and nearly 70 percent of them are
illiterate, they have a natural bent for politics.
   The country has more than 100 nationally recognized political
parties, most of whom usually boycotted elections because they were
convinced Ershad and his Jatiya Party would not permit their
candidates to win.
   This time, when Mrs. Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party and
Hasina's Awami League sounded the call for an anti-Ershad strike,
doctors, lawyers and TV actors joined the usual party activists,
students and rent-a-crowds from the shantytowns.
   Merchant sailors and civil servants resigned their government
jobs in protest.
   The military was silent. For the first time, Bangladesh was
headed for political change without tanks rolling down the streets
or army officer assassins crashing into a president's house in the
dark of night.
   If the opposition can maintain its unity and momentum - and
these are still major questions - Hasina and Mrs. Zia should find
personal and political satisfaction.
   Hasina's father was Sheik Mujibur Rahman, Bangladesh's first
president, who was assassinated during a military coup in 1975.
Mrs. Zia's husband, President Ziaur Rahman, was assassinated in
another military coup in 1981.
   If the opposition permits it, Ershad, a credible poet and a
skillful golfer, may be able to realize a dream he spoke of during
his interview in September.
   ``When I am no longer president, I can go back to the golf
course and play 18 holes, instead of the nine holes I normally play
now in the mornings.''

<HEAD>Plan Guarantees European Women 14 Weeks Paid Maternity Leave</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SYDNEY RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New legislation being considered by the European
Parliament will guarantee working women in European Community
countries at least 14 weeks maternity leave at full pay and the
guarantee of a job on return.
   The proposal contrasts sharply with policy in the United States,
where there is no federal law guaranteeing maternity leave.
   All 12 European Community countries already offer women some
form of paid maternity leave, but the new directive sets a minimum
and bars dismissal linked to pregnancy.
   The draft directive, passed last week by the European
Parliament's committee on women's rights, also provides two weeks'
compulsory rest before birth. It applies to any woman working full
or part time.
   ``This directive stops women from being penalized for what is a
normal part of a woman's life,'' said Christine Crawley, chairwoman
of the committee and a Labor Party EC parliamentarian from Britain.
   ``It will result in a lot more British women having the same
career opportunities as men,'' she said. ``It is a major
breakthrough.''
   British women have the most to gain under the new legislation.
Under existing British law, women are entitled to six weeks' leave
at 90 percent of regular pay, followed by an additional 12 weeks at
the equivalent of $74.50 per week.
   French women, by comparison, have 16 weeks leave at full pay.
Germany grants 14 weeks at full pay, and Denmark offers 28 weeks at
90 percent pay.
   The new European directive also requires employers to improve
working conditions for pregnant and breast-feeding women. It
stipulates that pre-natal visits to the doctor be counted as work
time with no loss of pay.
   In the United States, 30 states have laws granting unpaid leave
from six weeks to one year.
   ``It's not a question of pay. We're the only Western
industrialized country that does not permit job-protected leave,''
Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D.-Colo., said in a telephone interview
from Washington.
   Ms. Schroeder was the prime sponsor of a bill, known as the
Family amd Medical Leave Act, that was vetoed by President Bush
last spring. The bill provided 10 to 12 weeks of unpaid leave.
   She said the bill will be reintroduced in the next session of
Congress, and that the European legislation will increase
congressional determination to see it made law.
   ``I'm glad to know there's enlightenment somewhere on the planet
and I hope it spreads to the United States,'' Ms. Schroeder said.
   The Bush administration, in vetoing the legislation, argued that
it was not the government's role to dictate how private industry
dealt with employees.
   ``If that argument were taken to logical conclusion, there would
be no health or safety standards at all at work,'' Mrs. Crawley
said.
   Maternity leave is one of many benefits offered by European
governments attempting to encourage women to reproduce. Many
governments are concerned by a birth rate that is stable or falling
and a population that is graying.
   One-third of Europe's 321 million people are over age 50. That
proportion could reach one-half by the year 2000, according to some
estimates.
   In much of the Third World, birth rates are soaring.
   The European directive will be considered by Parliament during
its next full session, which begins Monday. It then goes to the EC
Council of Ministers for approval. If approved, it has the force of
law throughout the European Community after Dec. 31, 1992.
   One European Parliament official said the chance of passage was
``better than excellent.''
   Mrs. Crawley said Italy, which holds the rotating EC presidency,
hopes to have the maternity directive passed by Dec. 18. Britain is
the only member to have expressed reservations, she said.

   A pocket radio stopped a bullet fired
point-blank at a mugging victim's heart.
   ``I call it a miracle of God,'' said Gary Lee, who was shot at
after his car had broken down.
   He was at a telephone booth calling for help early Tuesday when
he was approached by two young men, one carrying a handgun, Sgt.
Doug Tantee said.
   ``They asked him for his wallet and he complied,'' Tantee said.
``Nevertheless, the one with a gun put it right up over the left
side of his chest - right over the heart - and fired once.''
   Lee reeled from the impact and collapsed to the sidewalk, but he
suffered only minor injries.
   Paramedics found the what looked like a .25-caliber slug
imbedded in the radio in the left breast pocket of Lee's jacket,
Tantee said. The assailants, described as 18 to 20 years old,
escaped with the wallet, which contained $100.
   ``I was going to listen to a little bit of the football game,''
said Lee. ``I'm sure glad I had that radio.''

   President Bush today saluted
President Carlos S. Menem for quashing a military rebellion and
said it demonstrated that ``the days of violence and dictatorship''
in Argentina are over.
   Bush, at a news conference with Menem at the presidential
palace, also said ``I'm not optimistic'' that Iraq's Saddam Hussein
will withdraw from Kuwait without a fight.
   He praised the Argentine president for sending two warships to
the gulf to help enforce the United Nations sanctions against Iraq,
and for the tough free-market reforms Menem has instituted to cure
Argentina's hyperinflation.
   Bush reiterated that there will be no concessions for the Iraqi
dictator and said there should be no effort to help Saddam find a
face-saving way to pull his troops out of Kuwait.
   ``When naked aggression takes place, it's not a question of
finding (saving) face for the aggressor,'' Bush said heatedly.
``When a country is literally raped and pillaged, should the world
go out and try to find a way to save face for he who has raped and
pillaged that country?''
   Bush came to the Argentine capital this morning from Uruguay,
midway through his five-country trek through South America. Just
two days ago, bullets flew in Buenos Aires during a short-lived
military rebellion.
   But the troops, who took over the armed forces headquarters a
block from the presidential palace, surrendered by day's end. It
was the fourth military uprising in four years for Argentina's
nascent democracy.
   ``Argentina helped lead the way in restoring democracy and
President Menem and the Argentine people proved again this week
that they will not permit any group to return Argentina to the days
of violence and dictatorship,'' said Bush. It was ``a superb show
of strength and commitment.''
   He said Menem has also been a leader in the continent's shift to
free-market reforms and privatization of state-run industry, and he
said, ``I am very grateful for Argentina's strong leadership and
support for the world's common purpose in the Persian Gulf.''
   Menem praised Bush's Enterprise for the Americas initiative to
spur free trade among the nations of the Western hemisphere.
Relations with the United States ``are now very good and they will
get better after this visit,'' he said.
   On Iraq, Bush said, ``I'm not optimistic. I see no evidence
Saddam Hussein is wiling to comply fully with the U.N.
resolutions.''
   Menem said, ``I share everything that has been said here by the
president. ... The only thing is for Iraq to withdraw without
conditions.''
   On his plans to meet at the White House with Iraq Foreign
Minister Tariq Aziz and to send Secretary of State James A. Baker
III to Baghdad before Jan. 15, Bush said:
   ``I view these talks as confined by or, put it this way,
mandated by the U.N. Security Council resolutions. Period,'' said
Bush. ``That means no concession of territory. That means freedom
of innocent people that are held against their will. That means
respect for embassies. ... And that means the eventual security and
stability of the gulf, although that's not specified by the
resolution.''
   ``I don't view these talks as having anything to do with
concessions that stop short of full implementation of U.N. Security
Council resolutions,'' he said.
   On a separate matter, Bush said the new GATT treaty must tackle
agriculture subsidies or the talks in Brussels will fail.
   He promised that ``if that round fails, we will work bilaterally
with the Argentines to see that their trade with us is not set
back.'' The European Community's reluctance to curb protectionist
measures for its farmers is jeopardizing the negotiations.
   On Argentina's steep foreign debt, Bush predicted Menem's
economic reforms will lead ``to a happy ending'' by making the
country more attractive to foreign investors. He said the United
States ``can try to be helpful with the private banks,'' although
it is primarily a matter for the banks and the Argentine government
to resolve.
   Hours before Bush's arrival, bombs exploded in two branches of
the U.S.-owned Chase Manhattan Bank in Buenos Aires' suburbs. No
one was injured, police said, and no group immediately claimed
responsibility.
   After the red-carpet welcome and a wreath-laying at a monument
to Gen. Jose de San Martin, a hero of Argentine independenc, Bush
went to the presidential palace, the Casa de Gobierno, for private
talks, a working luncheon and a news conference with Menem.
   While greeting diplomats at the palace, a grim-faced Bush shook
hands with the Iraqi ambassador to Argentina, Sahib-Hussain Tahir.
As the Iraqi diplomat approached, Bush stopped smiling and gave
Tahir a quick, formal handshake without exchanging a word. The
encounter contrasted sharply with the warm greetings Bush gave all
the other members of the diplomatic corps.
   Bush arrived here aboard his Marine One helicopter after a
75-minute flight across the River Platte from Punta del Este,
Uruguay.
   Authorities in Santiago, Chile, reported a bombing there this
morning of a bridge near the U.S. Consulate, the latest in a series
of explosions by leftist Chilean groups protesting Bush's planned
visit Thursday. There were no casualties.
   This was the third stop on Bush's five-nation, six-day South
American tour. He began the morning with a private breakfast with
Uruguayan President Luis Alberto Lacalle in Punta del Este, capping
a relaxed overnight stay in the ocean resort.
   Bush said Tuesday he was confident that Monday's military
uprising in Argentina was not a reflection on the stability of
Argentine democracy. ``It was a military-vs.-military
controversy,'' Bush said.
   Bush moves on to Chile Thursday and Venezuela on Friday before
heading home Saturday.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
today the United States will strike ``suddenly, massively and
decisively'' if military force is needed to get Saddam Hussein out
of Kuwait.
   Testifying before Congress, Baker staked out a hard line against
Saddam. He said his proposed trip to Baghdad later this month was
not an opening for negotiations.
   ``This is not to be a meeting of negotiation over the terms of
the U.N. resolutions,'' Baker said, adding that he would stick with
the international demands for complete and immediate Iraqi
withdrawal from Kuwait.
   Baker stopped short of saying the Bush administration would
launch an attack to liberate Kuwait after Jan. 15, the deadline
established last week by the United Nations Security Council. But
he left no doubt about the administration's determination to remove
Saddam quickly.
   ``If it (force) must be used, it will be used suddenly,
massively and decisively,'' he told the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee.
   In Buenos Aires, Argentina, Bush said any talks Baker might have
in Baghdad would be mandated by the U.N. Security Council
resolutions.
   ``That means no concession of territory. That means freedom of
innocent people that are held against their will. ...And that means
the eventual security and stability of the gulf, although that's
not specified by the resolution,'' Bush said in the Argentine
capital, midway through a five-country South American trip.
   Baker underscored comments made last Friday by Bush, who said he
would not allow U.S. soldiers to become involved in another
protracted, divisive war such as Vietnam.
   Baker said ``it would be very helpful'' if Congress would
support the type of resolution passed by the U.N. Security Council.
   ``Congressional underscoring of the message that we are trying
to send could significantly reduce the chance of war,'' he said.
   Saying that holding off a military clash with Iraq would hurt
the United States and help Saddam kill Kuwait, Baker said the
U.N.-imposed economic squeeze ``has had little, if any, effect on
(Saddam's) inclination to withdraw.''
   However, Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., and several other senators
challenged Baker, saying the administration was giving up on
sanctions prematurely.
   ``This is a time for the patience of the long-distance runner,''
Sarbanes said.
   He told Baker: ``You've placed us on a course to war.''
   On the other side of the Capitol, CIA Director William Webster
echoed Baker, saying there was no indication the sanctions are
forcing Saddam to rethink his policy on Kuwait.
   ``Our judgment has been, and continues to be, that there is no
assurance or guarantee that economic hardships will compel Saddam
to change his policies or lead to internal unrest that would
threaten his regime,'' Webster told the House Armed Services
Committee.
   Baker, whom Bush has offered to send to Baghdad as an emissary,
sought to rebut arguments made by members of Congress, some former
U.S. military commanders and former Defense Secretary Robert S.
McNamara that sanctions should be given more time to disrupt the
Iraqi economy and compel Saddam to pull out of Kuwait.
   ``Waiting not only gives Saddam time to break the sanctions, but
it imposes costs on us,'' Baker said. ``As we wait, Saddam will
continue torturing Kuwait, killing it as a nation. ... He will
continue to fortify Kuwait, to build chemical and biological
weapons, and to acquire a nuclear weapons capability.
   ``As we wait, he expects other issues to deflect our attention,
weaken our resolve and dissolve the international coalition. And as
we wait, the burden of Saddam's crime weighs heavier on the world.
That is why we must make credible our preparations to use force,''
Baker said.
   On Tuesday, in a sign of growing unease, House Democrats
overwhelmingly adopted a non-binding resolution that said Bush
should not order an attack without prior approval from Congress.
   Democrats voted 177-37 in a closed-door caucus for the
statement, which also expressed support for the president's
diplomatic initiatives in the gulf crisis.
   Also Tuesday, McNamara, the defense secretary at the height of
the Vietnam war, told the Senate committee the administration
should continue to rely on economic sanctions as the main weapon
against Iraq for a year or more.
   ``Who can doubt that a year of blockade will be cheaper than a
week of war?' McNamara said.
   The testimony reinforced expressions of caution over the last
several days from congressional Democrats and former U.S. military
commanders.
   But Bush, while visiting Uruguay, remarked: ``I've not been one
who's been convinced that sanctions alone will bring him (Saddam
Hussein) to his senses.''
   He said he disagreed with two former chairmen of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, Gen. David Jones and Adm. William Crowe, who
suggested Bush give the sanctions up to 18 months to work.
   ``I don't agree with them,'' Bush said. ``I can't say how long,
but I don't agree with them.''
   Meanwhile, Republican Sen. Larry Pressler of South Dakota said
Americans want peace.
   ``If we start having body bags come back, we will have a very
serious revolt in terms of public opinion,'' he said.
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., added: ``We have time. I
don't see any hurry. I don't see any doubt that he either gets out,
or he gets thrown out, blown out.''
   Webster testified as Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., opened three weeks
of hearings by his House Armed Services Committee on the three
major options to solving the gulf crisis - sanctions, diplomacy and
war.
   ``The country is united on ends but divided on means,'' said
Aspin, who unlike his counterpart on the Senate Armed Services
Committee, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., backs Bush's recent deployment of
200,000 troops in addition to the 240,000 already in the gulf area.
   And yet, Aspin said, ``action that isn't backed by consensus
will mean disaster. Whatever we do, the country, the Congress and
the president must do it standing on common ground.''

<HEAD>Group Would Ban Whole Milk from Schools</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A public interest group seeking more healthful
school lunches drew a bead on whole milk Wednesday, calling upon
Congress to ban milk with more than 2 percent fat from school
cafeterias.
   The Citizens' Commission on School Nutrition also called for
increased spending on the school lunch program, and urged schools
to reduce the overall fat content of lunches to 35 percent of
calories within the next 2 to 4 years. Ultimately, it said, the
standard should be 30 percent.
   ``I think whole milk's days are numbered in the school lunch
program,'' said Michael F. Jacobson, executive director of the
Center for Science in the Public Interest. The school nutrition
commission was organized by the center, a nonprofit organization
which promotes improved health and environmental policies.
   Susan Acker, a spokeswoman for the Agriculture Department, which
administers the school lunch program, noted that milk for the
lunches was required to be low-fat at one time. Congress passed
legislation in 1979 requiring that whole milk be served, land the
department has since issued rules requiring that the full range of
milk, from skim to whole, be available.
   Jacobson said the dairy industry was instrumental in reversing
the original low-fat rule.
   Nevertheless, he said, he thinks the chances for the proposed
low-fat rule are very good.
   ``The whole nation is moving in the direction of health,'' he
said. ``The only milk McDonald's serves is 1 percent low-fat milk.
Can't schools do as well as McDonald's? I think the changing
environment is going to influence Congress.''
   Dairy industry officials referred inquiries to Monica Olson of
the National Dairy Council, who was not in her office on Wednesday.
   The commission's report said a meal of grilled cheese and peas,
served with whole milk, draws 41.4 percent of its calories from
fat. This would be reduced to 37 percent with 1 percent milk and to
34 percent with skim milk, it said.
   Another organization, Public Voice for Food &amp; Health Policy,
said the recommendations do not go far enough. Public Voice has
called for Congress to require limiting the fat content of school
lunches to 30 percent of calories.
   The Agriculture Department has issued guidelines establishing
this as a non-binding standard for Americans, but Ms. Acker said
the department believes it is ``going to be a slow process'' to put
it into effect.
   Asked for comment on the commission's report, she said, ``We are
in agreement with a number of the recommendations they made, but
they would like to see us move toward them more quickly than we
think we will be able to.''
   An estimated 24 million children eat federally subsidized school
lunches.
   ``With more single-parent households, more working mothers, and
more children in poverty, school lunches are more important than
ever,'' the commission said.
   ``For many children, the school lunch has made the difference
between going hungry and being satisfied, between being
undernourished and being well fed,'' the committee said.
   The panel called upon Congress to ``greatly increase'' the
amount spent per student on school lunches but did not say how much
additional money was needed. It said current funding, adjusted for
inflation, is 58 percent of what it was when the program was
started in 1946.
   One of its members, Vivian Pilant, director of school food
services for South Carolina, said it would take at least $200
million to implement the department's non-binding guidelines in
school lunchrooms.

   ``Misery'' star Kathy Bates dug up some
pretty creepy company to prepare for her role as a psychotic nurse
in director Rob Reiner's latest film.
   Miss Bates said she read about some psychotics before taking on
the role of Annie Wilkes, an obsessive nurse who keeps her idol, a
romance novelist played by James Caan, a virtual prisoner in her
mountain cabin.
   ``It was to help me understand intellectually what was happening
to her, and you hope that it trickles down to the viscera,'' she
said.
   Her subjects included a Texas nurse accused of killing babies
and serial killer Ted Bundy. But Miss Bates said there was another
reason for her studies: a fascination with people who go over the
edge.
   ``I think we all want to know why,'' she said. ``We want to know
why people commit heinous crimes. We want to know why they commit
suicide. Everything we don't understand about ... you know, `There
but for the grace of God go I.'
   ``So, just in case it happens, you'll recognize it!''

   LONDON (AP) - Prince Charles, who's still recovering from a
broken right arm, said Wednesday he's wary of shaking hands with
Americans, especially Texans.
   He told a patient at a west London clinic that his arm, badly
broken in a June polo accident, continues to heal.
   ``But he said don't shake hands with anyone from America -
especially Texans - because they shake your hand too hard,'' said
Mabel Newson, 79, who met the heir to the British throne at St.
Dunstan's Community Leg Ulcer Clinic.
   The prince's arm was broken in two places above the elbow when
he fell off his horse during a polo match. The arm did not heal
properly and the 42-year-old son of Queen Elizabeth II had surgery
in September.

   LAS VEGAS (AP) - Caesars Palace is planning a gala birthday bash
next month to honor this city's most senior member of the
entertainment set, comedian George Burns.
   Burns will celebrate his 95th birthday at a private party for
invited guests Jan. 18 and a public performance Jan. 19.
   Until then, the entertainer, born Nathan Birnbaum on Jan. 20,
1896, isn't exactly sitting around counting his birthday candles.
   He appears several times a year at Caesars resorts in Las Vegas,
Lake Tahoe, Nev., and Atlantic City, and has just released his
eighth book, ``All My Best Friends.''
   He'll be taping a television special next month to mark his
birthday, and a fourth ``Oh, God!'' movie is being written for him.
   The new Burns book includes anecdotes about Eddie Cantor when he
was a singing waiter in a Coney Island saloon; Milton Berle as a
boy in a shoe ad; and the Marx Brothers when they were a musical
act.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Guns N' Roses singer Axl Rose and his
next-door neighbor agreed to avoid each other to chill a simmering
feud marked by the rocker's arrest on an assault complaint, Rose's
lawyer said.
   Rose, 28, and Gabriella Kantor, 37, entered an agreement stating
that ``she stays away from him and he stays away from her,''
attorney Jeff E. Scott said on Tuesday.
   The agreement was filed with Santa Monica Superior Court on Nov.
29, Scott said.
   Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies arrested Rose at his West
Hollywood apartment Oct. 30 following a dispute with Kantor, who
said the musician was blaring his music.
   Rose spent several hours in jail before posting $5,000 bail.
Prosecutors declined to file charges, citing a lack of evidence.
   Kantor claimed Rose confronted her outside his 12th-floor
apartment, threw her keys off a balcony and hit her on the head
with a wine bottle.
   Rose denied striking Kantor and suggested she hurt herself by
repeatedly pounding on his apartment door.
   Both Rose and Kantor have obtained temporary restraining orders
against each other.

   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - Strom Thurmond's birthday cake is getting
a little crowded. The oldest and most senior member of Congress
turned 88 on Wednesday.
   He planned to celebrate his birthday by sharing pizza with his
staff, and having dinner with family and friends.
   Thurmond has spent nearly half his life - 43 years - in
politics. He will be sworn in for his eighth term in January - more
than any other person in U.S. history. He has served under 10
presidents beginning with Franklin Roosevelt.
   But Thurmond says he's as enthusiastic as any freshman.
   ``Of course I'm excited. This is the most deliberative body in
the world,'' he said. ``I feel like the youngest senator in this
chamber.''
   Earlier in his career, Thurmond was the States Rights
presidential nominee, a leading opponent of civil rights
legislation and staunch supporter of racial segregation.

   Now that he's retired from baseball, Mike
Schmidt clearly knows which side his bread is buttered on.
   Schmidt, who once wondered aloud whether pessimistic
Philadelphians eat too many hoagies, is getting into the hoagie
business.
   The former Phillies slugger has invested in a new chain of
restaurants called Mike Schmidt's Philadelphia Hoagies, serving 25
varieties of hoagies and steak sandwiches.
   During his last spring training in 1989, the star third baseman
speculated to a Florida reporter that Philadelphians' negative
outlook was diet-induced.
   ``I don't know if there's something in the air or something
about their upbringing or they have too many hoagies, too much
cream cheese, too much W.C. Fields, I don't know what it is,''
Scmidt said. ``But they're always so pessimistic.''
   The next day, a Philadelphia Daily News reporter presented
Schmidt with a hoagie - or submarine sandwich.
   The new chain is starting with two outlets in suburban Bucks
County.

   The nation's leading maker of cowboy boots
has agreed to stop selling boots made from python skins in
California, where the snake is considered an endangered species.
   Tony Lama Co. Inc. made the concession Tuesday after a lawsuit
was filed by the Los Angeles County district attorney's office. The
El Paso, Texas-based firm admitted no wrongdoing, but did agree to
pay $143,000 in penalties.
   Prosecutors said the case was brought earlier this year after
Los Angeles Zoo reptile curator Harvey Fischer reported that python
skin boots were being sold in the county.
   Investigators traced the boots to Tony Lama.
   Prosecutors said the boots were sold in boxes labeled: ``Boa
African'' and ``Legal in California.''
   A state law prohibits the import or sale of products using
endangered species.

   A DC-9 pilot complained he as lost in the
fog moments before his plane collided with another jetliner,
killing eight people, according to a transcript obtained by NBC.
   Federal investigators, while refusing to confirm the precise
conversation between the pilot and an air traffic controller, said
Tuesday the DC-9 crew had trouble finding its way just before
Monday's collision at the Detroit airport.
   Also, Northwest Airlines reported the captain was making his
first flight without another pilot observing since his return last
week from a five-year medical leave, and the plane's first officer
had joined the airline last March.
   Twenty-four people were injured, two critically, in the fiery
collision between the DC-9 and a Boeing 727, both operated by
Northwest. The 727 was rolling down a foggy runway toward takeoff
when the DC-9 pulled in front of it.
   There was another fire this morning on the wing of a Northwest
jetliner after it landed at Detroit Metropolitan Airport. The fire
was put out and passengers safely left the aircraft, officials
said.
   Northwest Airlines spokeswoman Christy Clapp said residual fuel
in an auxilary power unit ignited on the right wing. The fire was
spotted by ground crews as the Boeing 727 was taxiing to the
terminal, she said.
   NBC reported Tuesday that it had obtained a partial transcript
of a conversation between DC-9 pilot William Lovelace and a
controller.
   According to the transcript, the controller asked Lovelace to
verify the position of the DC-9, which was supposed to be heading
toward a runway for takeoff.
   ``Uh, we're not sure. It's so foggy out here, we're completely
stuck here,'' Lovelace said. ``Look's like we're on 21-Center
here.''
   ``If you're on 21-Center, exit that runway immediately, sir,''
the controller said.
   Moments later the planes collided.
   The pilots of both planes survived the collision, and the black
box recordings of cockpit conversations were being analyzed in
Washington.
   ``We obviously had interviews with people in the tower and we
have determined the DC-9 was having visibility problems,'' said
Alan Pollock, spokesman for the National Transportation Safety
Board. ``As far as exact wording, I cannot comment on that.''
   ``They had difficulty in keeping track of where they were,''
said NTSB investigator John Lauber. ``There were numerous
communications between the aircraft and the air traffic control
facilities with regard to that taxiway and exactly where they
were.''
   Lauber said the crew of a third Northwest airliner also reported
overhearing someone tell the tower they didn't know where they
were. But he said it was not known whether the communication came
from the DC-9.
   Pollock today said NTSB investigators expect to remain in
Detroit through the weekend but a formal report won't be completed
for nine to 12 months. Investigators today continued questioning
the planes' crews and controllers.
   Lovelace, 52, of Phoenix, had returned to work with Northwest on
Nov. 25 after a five-year medical leave for treatment of kidney
stones, said Northwest spokesman Bob Gibbons.
   He had made 12 flights between Nov. 25 and Nov. 30 and before
that underwent two weeks of ground school and 13 hours of simulator
flying before being cleared to return to work, Gibbons said.
   His first officer, James F. Schifferns, 37, of Spokane, Wash.,
was hired in March after a military career in which he flew a
variety of planes, including B-52 bombers, Northwest said. He had
150 hours flying with the airline.
   The 727 was piloted by Capt. Robert Ouellette, 42, of Dallas.
   The DC-9 on Monday was bound for Pittsburgh, Pa., with 43 people
aboard. The 727 was bound for Memphis, Tenn., with 153 people.
   The National Air Traffic Controllers Association estimated
visibility at a quarter mile. Thomas Murphy, president of the
association's Detroit local, said fog was so thick that controllers
couldn't see the crash from the tower and assumed at first they had
gotten the DC-9 out of the way in time.
   The crash ripped the 727's right wing off and tore lose the
DC-9's rear engine, sparking a fireball that swept the DC-9 cabin.
   No one aboard the 727 was injured, but fumes from the fire
killed eight people on the DC-9, said Wayne County Chief Medical
Examiner Bader Cassin.
   Seven victims remained hospitalized Tuesday.

   A group of legislators today demanded imposition
of a state of emergency and a freeze on all political parties and
parliaments to help pull the Soviet Union out of its political and
economic crisis.
   The group, which included the right-wing Soyuz group of
parliamentarians as well as the reformist Liberal-Democratic Party,
all but called for a military coup as a means of solving the
nation's problems.
   The group's leaders announced the legislators were forming a
National Salvation Committee and demanded transfer of power to it,
the state news agency Tass and the independent news agency Interfax
reported. The committee asked the army to help implement the plan,
calling the military, ``the sole force still resisting the
disintegration of the state,'' Interfax reported.
   Vladimir Zhirinovski, a leader of the Liberal-Democratic Party
and spokesman for the committee, said in a telephone interview that
the coalition represented 400 lawmakers in the 2,250-member
Congress of Peoples' Deputies.
   Sentiment for a crackdown also is widespread in the Communist
Party, which holds a majority in most of legislative bodies on the
national and local level. Many Communists want President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev to call a state of emergency and enforce it through the
armed forces and the KGB security police.
   The National Salvation Committee seemed to have the same goals,
although its goals were not spelled out clearly during the news
conference its leaders called today to announce the group's
existence.
   With all but one of the 15 Soviet republics seeking some form of
independence or autonomy from central government, many officials
fear for the very structure of the Soviet Union.
   The Soviet economy also is crumbling as the old command system
is failing and grocery shelves in major cities are bare.
   Across the capital, Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin
harshly warned military officers at the Dzerzhinsky Military
Academy that ``if the army enters our boiling society as an active
factor, confrontation will increase many times, and carry the
society to catastrophe.''

   Charles H. Keating Jr. clearly didn't care
much for a red-bearded federal thrift regulator, William K. Black.
And by the looks of their faces Wednesday, defense attorneys for
the Keating Five senators cared little more for him.
   ``Kill him dead,'' Keating once wrote in reference to the lawyer
for the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
   Black proved to be a dramatic witness during the 12th day of
public hearings by the Senate Ethics Committee into the five
senators who face allegations they unethically intervened with
regulators on behalf of their political patron, Keating.
   Defense attorneys objected, paced, stammered and complained
throughout Black's testimony, which not only supported other
regulators' allegations but raised new ones.
   ``It is the most fundamental smear,'' declared William Taylor,
attorney for Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif. And later, ``What this
witness testified to are not facts.''
   ``Innuendo,'' said James Hamilton, attorney for Sen. Dennis
DeConcini, D-Ariz. ``... Reckless and irresponsible.''
   The lawyers tangled with the committee's special counsel, Robert
S. Bennett, who called Black as a witness. Time and again, the
committee chairman, Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., settled the dispute
in his unruffled Alabama drawl.
   ``Now, he's got wide latitude to address the witness,'' Heflin
said.
   Back described arcane accounting practices, but he also
distilled them into language anyone in the room or watching on
television could follow.
   Keating's Lincoln Savings and Loan operated like a ``Ponzi
scheme,'' or financial pyramid dependent on an ever-increasing
churning of assets, he said.
   Its parent, Keating's American Continental Corp., was no more
than a ``shell'' that siphoned dividends from Lincoln and
distributed them through inflated salaries to Keating, his family
members and associates, Black said.
   ``We call it a scam,'' Black said simply. ``I think most people
do.''
   Lincoln, Black said, was ``probably the worst institution in
America.'' And the five senators' pressure, he said, led to a delay
in regulatory controls on Lincoln - thus causing increased losses
that taxpayers now have to pay for, to the tune of $2 billion.
   ``Instead of people trying to help bring it under control, five
U.S. Senators were pushing us in the opposite direction,'' he said.
   None of the Keating Five senators were present for Black's
testimony. Besides Cranston and DeConcini, they are Republican John
McCain of Arizona and Democrats John Glenn of Ohio and Donald
Riegle of Michigan.
   Keating, the Arizona highflier now under indictment in
California, had long ago targeted Black as a problem.
   The ethics committee released copies of a memo Keating wrote to
his chief Washington lobbyist, Jim Grogan, on July 15, 1987, making
clear he wanted Black removed. In it, Keating refers to the then
speaker of the House, Jim Wright of Texas, as an ally.
   The memo begins: ``Highest Priority - Get Black,'' with the last
two words underlined.
   ``Good Grief,'' Keating wrote. ``If you can't get Wright and
Congress to get Black - kill him dead - you ought to retire.''

   Former President Ronald Reagan said
Wednesday that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has lost
control of the economy and may have to resort to martial law to
preserve stability.
   ``I think it can be said that today President Gorbachev controls
the Soviet Foreign Ministry, and he commands the loyalty of the KGB
and the military, but he does not control the economy or the
political direction of the 15 republics,'' Reagan said in an
address to the Cambridge Union debating society.
   He said the best hope is that the Soviet Union will peacefully
evolve into a loose confederation.
   However, ``it is conceivable that President Gorbachev will feel
the need to invoke some of his more drastic powers, using the army
and the KGB to impose and maintain martial law,'' Reagan said.
   ``If he does so, I believe it would not be from some power-mad
impulse, but rather from a belief that such an action would be the
only way to save his nation from instability.''
   In the course of six summit meetings with Gorbachev, Reagan said
he came to recognize the Soviet leader as a friend.
   About his meeting with Gorbachev in September, Reagan said:
   ``This time I saw him not only as a friend, but a friend in
need, for his nation was, and is, going through a period of great
uncertainty and turmoil.''
   Reagan, making the only public address of his five-day visit in
England, spoke at an event honoring the 175th anniversary of the
founding of the Cambridge Union.
   He was welcomed with loud applause as he walked in slowly,
nodding to the main floor and the jammed galleries. The crowd of
more than 500 students and faculty listened intently to his speech,
delivered in a soft voice tailored for microphones and not for
Victorian debating chambers.
   Reagan said he looked forward to an economic competition between
the Soviet Union and the West, but ``first we must show them how
the game is played.''
   Reagan, who once spoke of the ``evil empire'' centered in the
Kremlin, said Western democracies must now be ``teachers, not
preachers'' to emerging democracies.
   ``The evil leaders who once ruled a Soviet empire are gone and
so is the empire, replaced by a modern realist at the top who has
unleashed pent-up forces that yearned for freedom and democracy,''
he said.
   ``As the victors, it is for us to hold out the hand of
reconciliation, as we did with fallen enemies after World War II,
to tend to the sprouts and saplings of democracy in the former
adversary's land until they can grow strong and tall on their
own.''

<HEAD>Hackers Swipe Millions in Phone Service from NASA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Computer hackers have stolen some $12 million in
free telephone service through Johnson Space Center in what at
least one expert said was the biggest such theft in the nation,
according to published a report.
   Hundreds of people have used the system over at least two years,
the Houston Chronicle reported Wednesday.
   ``It's the biggest one I've ever heard of, and certainly the
longest-running one I've ever heard of,'' said Detective Jim Black,
computer crime unit coordinator of the Los Angeles Police
Department and a leading authority on telecommunications theft.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration could not
determine precise figures for the loss, said spokesman Steve
Nesbitt.
   The $12 million figure was calculated from costs of similar
break-ins described by law enforcement agents specializing in
computer crime.
   Nesbitt said the service was stolen in two ways - by using a
long-distance credit card number and by direct use of NASA's phone
lines. The credit card fraud was discovered by AT&amp;T when use of the
number exceeded typical patterns.
   The heavy losses were sustained through four lines in the space
center's regular phone system.
   ``That was shut down. It's been deactivated,'' Nesbitt said.
   The incident at NASA is the second such infiltration of a
government agency to come to light in recent weeks. On Nov. 17, it
was reported that computer hackers and others had stolen phone
service worth millions through the Houston offices of the Drug
Enforcement Administration.
   In both instances, intruders gained access to the Federal
Telephone System, a phone service similar to a WATS line. The
Federal Telephone System has no per-call billing, a fact that
allows abuses to go undetected for so long.

   Soviet soldiers on Wednesday unloaded an emergency
food shipment of Israeli watermelons, tomatoes and oranges that
Israeli leaders say is a gesture of thanks for allowing thousands
of Soviet Jews to emigrate.
   Soviet troops shook hands with Israelis on the airport tarmac
after 10 tons of the produce was unloaded from an Israeli passenger
plane.
   The shipment, destined for a Moscow hospital, was organized by
the quasi-governmental Jewish Agency, which helps settle Jewish
immigrants in Israel.
   The Boeing 767 of the national carrier, El Al, then returned to
Tel Aviv via Bucharest, Romania, where it picked up another cargo
of 250 Soviet Jewish immigrants to Israel.
   A record number of 150,000 Jews from the Soviet Union have
arrived in Israel this year.
   ``The food shipment is a gesture of gratitude to the Soviet
government for permitting Jews to return to their homeland,'' said
Jewish Agency spokesman Yehuda Weinraub.
   He said another 15 tons of powdered milk would be sent Thursday
to children's hospitals in Moscow, Leningrad and Kiev.
   The El Al jet landed at Moscow airport's cargo terminal before
dawn on Wednesday and was met by soldiers and seven army trucks.
   The soldiers, who did not speak English or Hebrew, worked
silently for an hour unloading the crates onto trucks. When they
were finished, several approached the Israelis to shake hands.
   At Bucharest's airport, the departure terminal was packed with
Soviet Jews who had traveled overland by bus, most from Odessa, to
board planes to Israel.
   The Soviet Union does not permit direct flights between Moscow
and Tel Aviv, and the immigrants are routed through transit
stations in Poland, Hungary and Romania.
   Some of the immigrants, tired from the long bus trip, complained
they were forced to wait hours at the airport in Bucharest to get a
seat on an El Al plane. Many clutched possessions as they waited,
including a cello, a small dog and a bundle of brooms.
   Matvey Rabinovich, 85, of Odessa, wore a jacket covered with
Soviet military medals. He said he planned to stay with a nephew,
who is a doctor in the Israeli town of Holon.

   A woman clutching a beer bottle and
cigarette committed suicide by walking into the stormy Atlantic,
authorities said Wednesday.
   The body of Sandra Cook, 48, of Newburyport, washed up Tuesday
about 3{ hours after she walked into the ocean from the north beach
of Plum Island, Police Chief Andy Avelis said.
   The body was found about five miles away at the Salisbury Beach
Reservation.
   ``She got out of the car and walked up to the water and jumped
right in,'' said Avelis. ``She made no effort to be rescued.''
   Authorities declined to comment on a motive for the suicide.
   Cook stood at the water's edge with her arms held high and told
a witness, ```I guess the ocean doesn't want me today,''' Avelis
said.
   She then returned to her car and drank beer before heading into
the surf, he said. She had a cigarette in one hand and the beer
bottle in the other when she entered the water.
   ``We ran down to the beach and she was being washed out with a
strong undertow. Everyone was screaming and pointing to where she
was,'' said Haverhill resident Timothy Slavit, who tried to rescue
her.
   ``The surf was so strong you couldn't go near the water.''
   Slavit said his father had warned Cook to get away from the
ocean.
   High tides, rain and strong winds lashed the New England coast
Tuesday, causing floods that closed roads and forced the evacuation
of at least 100 people from low-lying coastal areas.
   Plum Island is a strip of land in Newburyport, about 40 miles
northeast of Boston.

   U.S. Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, said Wednesday that if it comes to war in the
Persian Gulf, the United States intends to use ``overwhelming
force'' to win.
   He also said Saddam Hussein must withdraw unconditionally from
Kuwait to avert war.
   ``The United States is not going to blink on this one,'' said
Powell. ``He must leave.''
   Powell, addressing a London research center, the Royal United
Services Institute, said he did not doubt that the United States
and the other allied forces massed against Iraq could win a
conflict. But he said he did not know how long it would take.
   ``If we have to use force, if it comes to that ... the United
States intends to use overwhelming force to win decisively as
quickly as possible with as few casualties as possible,'' said
Powell.
   British government leaders have also stressed the no-compromise
policy in the past few days, amid speculation that the planned trip
to Iraq by U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III could end up
as negotiations.
   President Bush says the aim of Baker's trip is simply to ensure
that Saddam understands the seriousness of last week's U.N.
resolution authorizing the use of force unless Iraq withdraws from
Kuwait by Jan. 15.
   Some senior British defense officials have indicated they feel
that a decision on military action should be made quickly after the
Jan. 15 deadline. ``You will then either have to fish or cut
bait,'' one said this week, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Britain last month announced the near doubling of its military
force in the gulf to 30,000 in stepped-up preparations for war.
   Powell arrived Tuesday for a two-day British visit arranged
before the gulf crisis began in August.
   He conferred with British defense chiefs and met the new prime
minister, John Major. Powell will go on to Brussels, headquarters
of the NATO alliance.
   Powell, who is Bush's senior military adviser, brushed aside an
unconfirmed British television report that Iraq would withdraw if
allowed to keep a disputed oil field.
   ``The issue is more than the use of a single oil field,'' he
said.
   Answering questions, he said he could see no circumstances in
which Bush would compromise or negotiate with Saddam.
   Powell stopped well short of saying war was inevitable if Saddam
holds out after Jan. 15, but he stressed repeatedly there could be
no compromises.
   He also said that the size of the U.S. force in the gulf - some
400,000 troops - does not mean ``the only thing to do is to use it
or lose it.''
   ``We have given the president a solid military option to make
sure he has a whole range of options,'' he said.

   Kuwaiti exiles said Wednesday they have formed
a group that is drawing up plans to rebuild their country if the
Iraqi invaders are expelled.
   ``The assumption is that everything has been looted,'' said
Ibrahim Al-Shaheen, who was director general of Kuwait's housing
authority before the Aug. 2 invasion.
   He said the Kuwaiti committee, based in Washington, has spent
the last six weeks examining matters that will need to be addressed
presuming that the Kuwaitis regain possession of their country.
   The Kuwaitis say they are braced for the worse in terms of
damage. They believe they will have to replace items ranging from
hospital incubators to office computers.
   At Kuwait University, for instance, furniture, equipment, books,
administrative files and research projects have been removed or
destroyed.
   As an example of their planning, the exiles said they are
finding out where to buy generators, which will be needed to
provide electricity.
   Similar plans are being made for health, public welfare and
school facilities and for roads, Al-Shaheen said at a press
conference. The World Bank is also playing a role in planning for
rebuilding Kuwait.
   While Kuwaitis have been in contact with U.S. agencies to find
out where to obtain technical assistance, they said they don't need
money.
   The oil-rich emirate is financing its operations in exile with
the revenue from investments that had been made abroad before the
invasion.
   Mohammed Al-Sabah, chairman of the economics committee of the
Higher Planning Council of Kuwait, said the Kuwaitis are prepared
to spend ``billions of dollars'' in the rebuilding effort.
   Fawzi Al-Sultan, executive director of the World Bank, estimates
that $20 billion to $25 billion has been lost as Kuwait's economy
has ground to a halt and the country was stripped of its resources.
   Iraq has destroyed the nation's banking and financial system, he
said.
   Files and computers have been wiped out or stolen; nearly $4
billion in foreign exchange and gold reserves have been seized and
$5 billion in currency and bank deposits have been confiscated.

   Iraq has accepted President Bush's offer to
hold talks on the Persian Gulf crisis, the State Department said
today.
   ``We are engaged with them on dates and arrangements for the two
meetings,'' the department said.
   Bush had proposed that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein send his
foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, to Washington. Then, Bush said in
making the offer last Friday, Secretary of State James A. Baker III
would go to Baghdad.
   In Buenos Aires, Argentina, today, Bush said any talks would be
mandated by U.N. Security Council resolutions that have been
adopted since the crisis began.
   ``That means no concession of territory. That means freedom of
innocent people that are held against their will. ... And that
means the eventual security and stability of the gulf, although
that's not specified by the resolution,'' Bush said.
   His comments came before the State Department announced that
Iraq had accepted the offer to hold talks.
   Earlier today, Baker told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
that he would not negotiate with Saddam on the trip and added a new
warning: ``If force must be used, it will be used suddenly,
massively and decisively.''
   He said his meeting in Baghdad ``will not be the beginning of a
negotation over the terms of the United Nations resolutions.'' Nor,
Baker said, would he negotiate on subjects ``unrelated'' to the
Iraqi occupation of Kuwait.
   ``I will not be negotiating the Palestinian question or the
civil war in Lebanon,'' he said. ``Saddam did not invade Kuwait to
help the Palestinians. He did it for his own self-aggrandizement.''
   Saddam had said earlier that the Palestinian problem must be on
the agenda in any dialogue with Baker.
   Joe Wilson, the deputy ambassador in Iraq, was called in by the
Iraqi foreign minister to be told of Iraq's acceptance of the
offer, the announcement said.
   Wilson and a number of other U.S. officials remain in the U.S.
Embassy in Baghadad.
   Bush made last week's unexpected overture at a presidential news
conference in Washington.
   It followed mounting complaints in Congress that the
administration was rushing into war with Iraq over its invasion of
Kuwait without giving diplmacy enough time for the pursuit of a
peaceful settlement.
   Even so, Bush pledged the administration would not waver from
the resolution approved last Thursday by the U.N. Security Council
threatening a forceful eviction of Iraqi troops if they did not
withdraw by Jan. 15.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., urged Baker at today's hearing to
provide Saddam Hussein with ``a way out'' of the crisis. He
suggested one approach would be to propose the World Court resolve
Iraq's territorial claims against Kuwait.
   ``If at all possible, make that a meaningful trip,'' Simon
urged.
   Baker stressed that the U.N. resolution did not require the
United States to attack Jan. 15 or a day after. Without
elaboration, Baker said diplomatic steps were being taken in the
search for a peaceful solution.
   However, Baker insisted that Iraq must withdraw from all of
Kuwait, liberate all foreign hostages and permit the restoration of
the ousted government.
   Bush, in making the offer to swap envoys, said Baker would not
waver from the three demands.
   ``The best way to get that across is one-on-one, Baker looking
him in the eye,'' Bush said.

<HEAD>East Germans Asked to Bring a Soviet Soldier Home for the Holidays</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK FRITZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forget the bitter past. Remember the less
fortunate. Have a heart. Invite a Red Army soldier home for the
holidays.
   A German friendship society is asking east Germans to make life
a little easier for the Soviet force that occupied their former
nation for 40 years.
   The message? Set an extra place at the table this Christmas.
Pour another glass of champagne on New Year's Eve. Call the Soviet
command and ask them to send over a soldier.
   ``The inclination to help is very strong,'' Horst Gruetzke,
spokesman for the Berlin-based German Society, said Wednesday.
   The society's nationwide appeal is the latest demonstration of
gratitude to the Soviet Union for giving up its claim to East
Germany and allowing German unification.
   It comes amid a large-scale and remarkably popular effort by
German relief groups, labor unions and companies to ship hundreds
of tons of food and other necessities to ease the Soviet Union's
chaotic food situation.
   ``This appeal is in keeping with the relief effort,'' said
Gruetzke. ``We want to thank the Soviets for our sovereignty.''
   The German Society was formed in January with the goal of
improving relations between East and West Germany. Its members
include former Chancellor Willy Brandt.
   The government of eastern Brandenburg state said Tuesday it
would try to send holiday food packages to Soviets on their bases
and also sponsor an invite-a-soldier program.
   Once feared and reviled, the Soviet army is drawing mostly pity
these days as it prepares to pack up and leave what used to be East
Germany.
   Its mystique as a formidable fighting force has been replaced by
images of low-paid, unskilled young men heading back to a homeland
struggling with shortages and social turmoil.
   A news photographer recently caught two soldiers poking through
an eastern German garbage dump for something valuable to salvage.
   Reinhart Luschert, spokesman for the eastern German forces based
in Strausberg, said he welcomed efforts by Germans to share holiday
dinners with Soviet soldiers.
   ``We are glad about such activities because we know the problems
of the Soviet soldiers,'' he said.
   There have been widespread reports of desertions and suicides by
Soviet soldiers and assaults upon them by eastern Germans.
   Lt. Gen. Michael Kalinin, commander of Soviet forces in eastern
Germany, told a news conference in Potsdam on Wednesday that about
80 Soviet soldiers have deserted this year, and that 24 of them
fled to the West.
   The Soviets carved East Germany from the ruins of World War II
and turned it into a mirror image of its own Stalinist system.
   But Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms and refusal
to support the hard-iine Communist leader Erich Honecker helped
lead to Honecker's downfall, a free society and German unity.
   The Soviets have agreed to remove their 360,000 troops within
four years. Germany has agreed to build houses for them back in the
Soviet Union.
   German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has lobbied world leaders and his
own people to send aid to the Soviets to stabilize the collapsing
food distribution system that has created dire shortages.
   The German Red Cross said it was allocating $2 billion to the
effort.
   ``There are sister-city groups, civic groups, church groups, all
sorts of people getting involved in this,'' said Margitta
Zimmermann, a Red Cross spokeswoman in Bonn.
   At least 15 charitable groups have either sent or plan to send
powdered milk, baby food, preserved meats, clothing and other
supplies. Shipments are being made by trucks, freighters and
planes.

   Commuters mutinied against their bus
driver, fighting him for control of the bus in a wild ride, after
they saw him acting erratically, officials said.
   ``It was inexcusable, that the bus was allowed to continue for
two feet, never mind 20 minutes,'' said John Haley, Bay Area Rapid
Transit deputy general manager.
   The incident occurred Thursday on a Laidlaw Transit Co. bus
operated under contract with the transit authority.
   The driver, 34-year-old Kenneth Webb, who's in jail, was
scheduled to appear in Concord Municipal Court this week on charges
that include driving under the influence, battery, and having an
open container of alcohol in the bus, according to the Contra Costa
County district attorney's office.
   ``It is incomprehensible to us that this man could embark on
what was essentially a 20- or 25-minute odyssey without being
stopped,'' Haley said.
   Webb was arrested Thursday night after the California Highway
Patrol, transit police and Laidlaw employees converged on the
stopped bus.
   By that point, an unidentified passenger who had tried to
wrestle the driver out of his seat had suffered a broken jaw, Haley
said. Several of the 12 passengers aboard had tried to get control
of the bus, he said.
   ``This is a very serious situation that could have been
prevented,'' Haley said, criticizing the way the situation was
handled by bus company personnel in charge during the incident.
   The drama began about 10:45 p.m. Thursday aboard a bus that
provides express shuttle service from a station in Concord to
Brentwood. Laidlaw provides the drivers under contract with BART.
   Haley said that even before the bus left Concord, passengers
waiting to board the bus reported to the station agent that the
driver was ``acting erratically.''
   The agent telephoned transit police, local police departments
and supervising Laidlaw people, he said. By that time, the bus had
started for the Brentwood station.
   ``The (Laidlaw) supervisor had the opportunity to stop that bus
by radio immediately but they did not do so,'' Haley said.
``According to (Laidlaw's) own report their operator was speaking
in slurred speech and they did not stop the vehicle.''
   At one point, said Haley, the Laidlaw supervisor got into a car
and followed Webb's bus ``and noticed that the operator was
operating erratically.''
   Haley said that ``rather than stopping the bus immediately, the
supervisor pulled over to get a pay phone and call in to the
dispatcher to discuss how to handle the situation ... He didn't
want anyone to hear the conversation on radio.''
   Laidlaw officials did not immediately return a telephone call
seeking comment.

<TEXT>
   A never-published dance that Norwegian
composer Edvard Grieg withdrew from his orchestral masterpiece
``Peer Gynt'' was performed for the first time Wednesday, more than
100 years after it was written.
   Also played at the concert were three rare piano pieces that
Grieg composed when he was 17 years old and dedicated to a Swedish
sweetheart.
   Grieg played the piano pieces at his first public concert, as a
teen-ager in 1861. They were seldom, if ever, played again. The
composer later banned their performance and ordered his copies of
them destroyed after he died.
   Music lovers paid $86 - nealy four times the normal Oslo
concert-hall price - to hear the Grieg works at a benefit for a
proposed new $172 million opera house. The 1,400-seat hall was
almost full.
   Henrik Ibsen, Norway's best-known playwright, asked Grieg, the
country's leading composer, to write incidental music for Ibsen's
folklore poem, ``Peer Gynt.'' The poem is a fantasy about a man who
wanders from Norway to North Africa, meeting mountain trolls and
eventually finding love.
   Grieg composed the music in the 1870s. He wrote to a friend that
he didn't like the project but needed the money. Grieg felt the
suite would never be a success outside Scandinavia, but it became
one of his most admired compositions.
   Before ``Peer Gynt'' was performed, Grieg decided to remove the
dance, entitled, ``The Dance of the Mountain King's Daughter.'' It
was never published.
   Dag Schjelderup-Ebbe, a Grieg scholar, found the dance during
research for a catalogue of Grieg's music. The study by an expert
committee began in 1962 and the last of the resulting 20 volumes is
to be released in two years.
   Knut Skramm of the Victoria Recording Co. in Oslo said the dance
was ``quite simple, and we can understand why Grieg left it out.
But it does not show him in a bad light.''
   But pianist Geir Henning Braaten, who was to perform the Grieg
music at the concert, said he was ``in raptures'' over the dance.
   Schjelderup-Ebbe said the three early piano pieces are ``not the
Grieg we know...He was so young and had not found his own style.''
   ``You can hear that the young composer is a future star.
Therefore I see no reason not to perform it,'' Braaten said of the
decision to play the pieces despite Grieg's ban.
   Grieg's copies of the pieces were kept in Bergen, Norway, where
he was born. They were marked, ``May never be performed, and to be
destroyed after my death.''
   Grieg's sweetheart, Therese Berg, also played the piano in
Grieg's debut recital in 1861.
   After Berg's death, her copies of the pieces went to the
Stockholm Musical Academy in Sweden. They carried no restrictions
against playing the music, and were the basis for the performance
Wednesday.

   But the 6-foot-4, 265-pound governor may not be what the

tips.
   ``I'm not sure his recipe for banana pudding and vanilla wafers
is what they've got in mind,'' said the governor's spokesman, Ken
Renner.
   ``We invite you to become a part of this portfolio of ``Healthy

said the letter from editor Lee Haiken.
   The letter, which the governor received last week, said the
magazine was planning a special section on leaders who are showing
the way toward healthier lifestyles.
   McWherter's weight fluctuates from 265 to 285 pounds, Renner
said.
   The recommended weight for a man of that height with a medium
frame between the ages of 25 and 29 is 171-187 pounds, according to
the New York Public Library Desk Reference. McWherter is 60.

<TEXT>
   Some American and British women were
reunited with relatives Wednesday at a Baghdad hotel, and they
expressed hopes that President Saddam Hussein would free their
loved ones.
   Iraqi officials met the 18 American and 24 British women at the
airport and drove them to the Al-Mansour Melia hotel to meet their
relatives, who had been brought to the capital from the strategic
sites where they were held.
   ``Saddam told us if we come here we will not go back
empty-handed,'' said Dawn Bazner of Detroit, a member of Coming
Home, a hostage-support group.
   The group came to Baghdad accompanied by Bishop Thomas Gumbleton
of the Detroit archdiocese.
   Iraq is holding hundreds of Westerners hostage at strategic
sites in an effort to deter an attack by the multinational forces
in Saudi Arabia and the gulf region.
   ``I feel we are here to do something very spectacular,'' said
Jennifer Williams, 22 of Dallas, whose father is held hostage. Most
of the women in the group were wives of hostages.
   Donnitta Cole of Texas, who spoke with reporters at the airport
in Amman, Jordan, said the Iraqi ambasador in Washington had
promised a meeting with Saddam.
   ``Let us hope that it will happen,'' she said.
   ``We have no guarantees or promises,'' said Ellen Martin of
Detroit, who is trying to win the freedom of her husband Robert.
   ``My hopes are high that we all will be successful in getting
our people out,'' said Nina Ginn of Seattle. ``But we have no
concrete guarantees that that would be the case.''
   Iraq has pledged to release all the hostages in batches between
Dec. 25 and March. 25 if nothing happens to disturb ``the
atmosphere of peace.''
   Gilly Battersby, a British woman who acted as spokeswoman for
the hostage wives, said the group had brought medicine and baby
formula for children's hospitals.
   The American and British women said they were encouraged by the
success of some earlier groups that traveled to Baghdad to win the
freedom of relatives.
   Ten Britons were released by Saddam after their wives and
relatives flew to Baghad and appealed for their freedom. At least
four Americans were also freed after similar missions by their
families.
   Many of the women carried heavy gift-wrapped packets.
   ``At least we can be with our loved ones for Christmas and New
Year if we are unsuccessful in our mission,'' said one of the
American women in Amman. She spoke on condition of anonymity.

   The nuclear power industry is having a
meltdown over ``The Simpsons.''
   The prime-time cartoon show's evil power-plant owner with
overbite, the dozing employees and a three-eyed fish named Blinky
all have contributed to driving industry officials into a critical
mass. But more than anything, Homer Simpson has them glowing under
the collar.
   The U.S. Council for Energy Awareness, an industry information
group, told the ``Simpsons'' producers in a February letter it was
horrified to see nuclear plant workers portrayed as ``bungling
idiots.''
   Top ``idiot'' on the council's list was Homer, father of the
Simpson family and an employee of the fictitious Springfield
nuclear plant. Homer, perpetually in need of a shave, seems to care
less about safety than about naps, doughnuts and having enough
tartar sauce for his fish sticks.
   In various episodes, Homer gives away the plant's blueprints to
a foreign exchange student, his boss tries to bribe a plant
inspector with a bushel of cash, and three-eyed ``Blinky'' is found
swimming near the plant.
   ``I am sorry that the Simpsons has offended a lot of people in
the energy industry,'' Executive Producer Sam Simon said in a Feb.
5 letter to Carl Goldstein, a vice president of energy group. ``I
agree with you that in real life Homer Simpson would not be
employed at a nuclear power plant.
   ``On the other hand, he probably wouldn't be employed
anywhere.''
   After they exchanged a few more letters, Simon finally suggested
he and other Fox Broadcasting Co. executives tour a real nuclear
power plant.
   ``We had no illusion that this was suddenly going to turn `The
Simpsons' into anything resembling real life, and it hasn't,''
Goldstein said. ``But they were interested.''
   In April, the group converged on the San Onofre nuclear power
plant in San Clemente, Calif., 40 miles south of the Fox Los
Angeles offices.
   ``We don't have any Homers at our nuclear plant,'' said David
Barron, a spokesman for San Onofre's owner, Southern California
Edison, who accompanied the producers and writers.
   Simon said the tour showed that ``The Simpsons'' had been right
- and wrong - about nuclear power.
   Although they did little initial research, he said the
``Simpsons'' creators seemed to accurately represent worker
conditions - the cafeterias, lunch pails and radiation warning
signs. The writers placed Homer in a ``sector'' to illustrate an
impersonal bureaucracy, then discovered some plants actually used
that term.
   But Simon also said the tour also ``changed a lot of peoples'
minds. I think the facts are pretty powerful that it's a clean and
safe and important source of energy. While some of the shows were
in the works before, we really backed off that as a source of
comedy. No more three-eyed fish.''
   But don't have a cow, Simpsons fans.
   The show will continue to jab the industry in its third season
next year, but in a more responsible way, Simon said.
   For example, Homer is to begin a dinner grace with this: ``Thank
you for nuclear power, which has yet to cause a single fatality ...
at least in this country.''
   Plans even call for Homer to avert a nuclear meltdown.
   ``He's kind of asleep at the wheel and wakes up when there's an
alarm, and doesn't know which button to press, so he goes
eeney-meeney-miney-mo and hits a button and does avert a
meltdown,'' Simon said. ``He becomes a hero and feels guilty about
it. It's not a politically charged episode.''
   The domestic industry has been sensitive about its image since
one of the two Three Mile Island reactors was crippled in a 1979
accident that led to a $1 billion cleanup. And in 1987,
Pennsylvania's Peach Bottom plant was shut down for a time and 33
workers fined on charges of ``sleeping and-or inattention to
duty.''
   Asked if she watched ``The Simpsons,'' Three Mile Island
spokeswoman Mary Wells jokingly told a reporter, ``Goodbye!'' But
she relented, and confessed she finds the show funny.
   Simon said the producers had a practical reason for placing
Homer at a power plant.
   ``It was really just for the joke that this boob had a position
where he could possibly make a mistake and destroy the world,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Rebels Form Interim Cabinet To Run Country</HEAD>

<DATELINE>N'DJAMENA, Chad (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The rebels who have taken power in Chad
announced an interim Cabinet on Wednesday that includes holdovers
from the ousted regime as well as a former political prisoner.
   A 33-member Council of State held its first meeting in the
evening under the presidency of rebel commander Idriss Deby. No
communique was issued afterwards, but one of the members - who were
given the titles of commissars - said the council might stay in
power at least year.
   Several Chadian ambassadors abroad pledged to support the new
leaders, and France said it would keep a contingent of more than
1,000 troops in Chad to defend the new government against any
foreign aggression.
   In N'Djamena, there were disclosures about secret prisons where
opponents of ousted President Hissene Habre had been held. Nine
bodies with hands tied together reportedly were found at various
locations and taken to a morgue in the hope they could be
identified.
   Amnesty International, the London-based human rights group,
alleged in March that Habre had direct knowledge of detentions,
torture and summary executions of political prisoners.
   Residents said secret prisons had been found since Habre fled
Saturday that had not been known about previously.
   Habre fled N'Djamena following a three-week offensive by the
rebel forces of Idriss Deby, whose party named him interim leader
of Chad on Tuesday.
   In a nationally broadcast speech, Deby, 38, said he will
establish a multiparty democracy in this African nation of 5.4
million people, a former French colony.
   The names of the members of the interim Cabinet were released
Wednesday. They include top aides of Deby, but also the president
of the now-dissolved National Assembly, Jean Alingue, and two
holdovers from Habre's Cabinet - Justice Minister Abakar Mallah and
Environment Minister Kotiga Guerina.
   The new ``comissar'' for higher education, Gali Gata Ngothe, was
a political prisoner until Saturday.
   Chad's ambassadors at embassies in France, Algeria, Egypt and
Sudan pledged loyalty to Deby.
   The ambassador to France, Allam-Mi Ahmad, said the first steps
taken by Deby ``incontestably were measures in the direction of
reconciliation, civil peace and unity.''
   In Paris, French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said Deby has
asked that France keep its troops in Chad, and that his request was
granted.
   The rebels received 40 percent of their weapons from Libya,
French officials say. But Deby, in his broadcast address, ruled out
any concessions regarding Libya's claim to the Aouzou Strip, a
mineral-rich region in northern Chad.
   ``We will defend our national unity, the territorial integrity
of Chad within its borders inherited from colonization,'' he said.
   Libya on Wednesday pledged ``respect and non-interference in the
internal affairs'' of Chad, according to Libya's official news
agency, JANA.
   Chad gained independence from France in 1960. France, although
it ha troops in Chad as part of a pact with Habre, remained
neutral during Deby's recent offensive.
   Habre took his family and eight Cabinet ministers to Maroua in
Cameroon, according to the state newspaper The Cameroon Tribune. He
has made no public statements or appearances since his flight.
   JANA said Habre and his entourage took three imprisoned Libyan
military officers with them when they fled Chad, and it asked that
human rights organizations and the Red Cross work for their
release.
   Officials in Cameroon said some of Habre's ministers were
preparing to return to N'Djamena and reconcile themselves with
Deby.
   Deby was Habre's chief aide in a successful 1982 coup, but broke
away last year and formed a rebel movement. Habre and U.S.
officials claim Libya actively backed Deby's rebellion, but the
Libyans and Deby deny it.
   Libya's army occupied northern Chad in 1983 and 1986, prompting
France to 6end troops to back Habre. Libya was driven out in a
series of battles masterminded by Deby in 1987.
   Dumas, during a Cabinet meeting in Paris, said he received
reports of ``agitation'' in northern Chad and that supporters of
former Chadian President Goukouni Oueddei were involved. Oueddei
has been based in Libya since he was toppled by Habre and Deby in
1982.

   Citing a decline in government funding, the New
York Shakespeare Festival announced it will lay off 30 employees at
the end of the year and close its set, prop, lighting and sound
departments.
   ``It's totally a matter of economics,'' Joseph Papp, producer of
the Shakespeare Festival, said Tuesday. The festival currently
employs 123 people.
   The closings will save the festival, one of New York's leading
institutional theaters, about $750,000 a year, Papp said. The
festival has an annual budget of more than $14 million.
   Earlier this year, Papp turned down more than $700,000 from the
National Endowment for the Arts because of what he called
``restrictive measures'' in the agency's legislation. Papp also
expects a decline of 15 percent to 20 percent in funds from both
the city and state.
   The shops will close in mid-January and the theater will farm
out production work, said Papp. The festival will continue to
operate its own costume shop, he said.

   U.S. and Soviet negotiators have resolved
three big stumbling blocks as they work to complete a nuclear arms
pact for President Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev to sign in Moscow
early next year, U.S. officials say.
   The two sides, in meetings over the last month, have agreed to
limit Soviet Backfire bombers outside the treaty, to allow U.S.
nuclear programs with Great Britain to continue and to restrict the
launch and payload weight of the Soviets' modernized, ground-based
SS-18 missiles, said an official who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
   Plans for Bush's trip to Moscow are on hold while the
negotiators try to reach agreement on other technical matters
involving inspection of weapons systems and interpretation of
missile data.
   The White House has said Bush will go to Moscow only if the
treaty - which aims to cut U.S. and Soviet arsenals of long-range
nuclear weapons by 30 percent - is ready for signing. The pact will
call for scrapping hundreds of warheads under close supervision.
   Experts from both sides will meet Friday in Washington to work
on the remaining technical matters. The session is a precursor to
the meeting between Secretary of State James A. Baker III and
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze in Houston on Monday
or Tuesday.
   The two are expected to thrash out their remaining differences
and set a date for the Moscow summit. Shevardnadze is to then fly
to Washington to see Bush on Wednesday.
   Recent negotiating sessions produced agreement on three of the
outstanding differences holding up the pact, known as START, for
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, officials said.
   Specifically:
   -The United States agreed that the Soviet Backfire bomber can be
counted separately from other strategic weapons under the
agreement, officials said. A separate letter, outside the actual
START treaty, would limit the number of Backfires.
   Initially the United States had maintained the bombers had to be
included in the overall START limits of 1,600 heavy bombers and
other ballistic missiles the Soviets can retain, said an official
close to the talks.
   The source declined to reveal the number of Backfires that would
be permitted. The Soviets have 355 Backfires now, according to an
estimate by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a
London-based think tank.
   -The Soviets agreed to continued U.S. nuclear programs with
Great Britain as long as those programs are not seen as upsetting
the overall strategic balance. The cooperation primarily involves
submarine technology and missiles the United States provides for
British subs.
   -The negotiators have agreed that any modernized SS-18 could not
have the capability to carry heavier payloads, including warheads,
than the current SS-18. The treaty, however, would not limit
modernization such as improved accuracy or fuel efficiency, or
alteration in the types of warheads.
   Under the pact, the Soviets would cut the number of SS-18s by
half to 154.
   With those issues resolved, administration officials are still
cautious in predicting that the treaty will be ready for a January
summit.
   The remaining areas of disagreement, however, ``are not enough
for anyone to fall on their sword over,'' one U.S. official said.
   Another official described the remaining issues as ``loose
ends,'' but said they are significant enough to block the
agreement.
   Officials said that issues still to be worked out include
primarily differences over:
   -Monitoring of production facilities for mobile ballistic
missiles. The two nations disagree on where in the missile
construction process should be allowed. The United States wants
assurances for early inspection of Soviet SS-24 missiles, which
have 10 warheads, while the Soviets have insisted that inspection
of final assembly is sufficient.
   -To what extent each side must provide uncoded telemetry from
testing of ballistic missiles so that the other can interpret the
data and verify compliance with the treaty's restrictions on
missile performance.
   -Whether the Soviets will be allowed to inspect the B-2 bomber
to ensure it is not equipped to carry long-range, air-launched
Cruise missiles armed with nuclear weapons, as the United States
has assured them.

<TEXT>
   Scientists have cloned a gene that helps the
electric ray deliver its stunning shocks, an advance that may help
in development of drugs to fight cystic fibrosis.
   The gene tells cells how to make a protein called the chloride
channel, which transports electrically charged particles through
the cell membrane.
   In the ray, that transport process is used to build up the
voltage needed to stun enemies or prey.
   Human cells use a similar chloride channel for other purposes,
and in cystic fibrosis it fails to work properly. That promotes
development of a thick, sticky mucus that sets the stage for fatal
lung infections.
   Scientists may be able to use the newly cloned gene to isolate
and purify a human chloride channel, said Robert Beall, the Cystic
Fibrosis Foundation's executive vice president for medical affairs.
   The human channel could then be used in research to screen
potential drugs for treating cystic fibrosis, he said. Other
experiments could illuminate how the channel is regulated by the
protein that is defective in cystic fibrosis, yielding new insights
that could point to possible therapies, he said.
   The cloning of the ray chloride channel is reported in
Thursday's issue of the British journal Nature by scientists at
Hamburg University in Germany. The cystic fibrosis foundation
helped pay for the work.

<HEAD>Depression Strikes Women Twice As Often As Men, Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women are more than twice as likely as men to
suffer major depression because of factors ranging from sexual
abuse to a passive way of thinking, the American Psychological
Association said Wednesday.
   Biology plays only a minor role in the disproportionate rate of
depression among women, said the study of an APA task force. It
cited victimization, unhappy marriages, and cultural traditions
shaped to diminish feminine worth as more serious causes.
   Ellen McGrath, a New York psychologist who chaired the study,
said that the APA committee deemed the findings dramatic. ``No
matter what the station in life - black, white, rich, poor,
educated or untrained - ``all women are more at risk for depression
than men,'' she said.
   Bonnie Strickland, an University of Massachusetts-Amherst
professor of psychology and past president of the APA, called
untreated depression a major public health problem in the United
States, costing about $16 billion and leading to about 30,000
suicides annually.
   ``One in every four women and one in every eight men will suffer
a serious clinical depression at some time in their lives,'' she
said. ``Depression is chronic, recurrent and the cost of human
suffering is unfathomable.''
   ``One of the most astonishing findings is how often this gender
difference is denied'' in the health-care field, said McGrath.
``What is usually said is that women are more ready to complain,
more able to talk about their feelings than men are, and that women
are more comfortable utilizing mental health services.''
   The task force study, she said, shows ``this does not hold.''
   ``There are true differences (in depression) between men and
women,'' said McGrath. ``The major reason seems to be culturally
implemented. Biology is not as strong a factor as previously
suspected.''
   Strickland said the rates of depression are shifting more toward
the young, noting some studies show that as early as age 16,
American women begin to develop a passive view of themselves, one
of the major elements that can lead to depression illnesses.
   The task force partially based its study on previous research
worldwide on depression among women. The group also conducted
research of its own to draw its conclusions.
   Among them:
   -Biology is not as strong an influence in women's depression as
previously believed. Menstruation, pregnancy, abortion and
menopause are not major factors in significant depression for most
women. Infertility, however, is, with up to 40 percent of women
studied saying the inability to conceive is ``the most upsetting
experience of their lives.''
   -Depression in women may be related to gender-related
personality styles that include passive, dependent patterns, and
negative thinking, but this requires more research.
   ``The research suggests women focus too much on discussing
depressed feelings instead of developing action and mastery
strategies,'' McGrath said.
   -Abuse early in life may play a large role. The study said that
between 37 percent and half of all women have had ``a significant
experience of physical or sexual abuse before the age of 21.'' For
many women, depression may be the result of post-traumatic stress
syndrome or even undiagnosed head trauma from battering.
   -Unhappy marriages and parenthood are important factors. The
study said that women are three times more likely than men to be
depressed in unhappy marriages, and that having young children
around creates a vulnerability to depression. ``The more children
in the house, the more depression is reported,'' the study said.
   -The report called poverty a ``pathway to depression.'' It said
that 75 percent of the U.S. poor are women and children.
   -Some groups of women are particularly susceptible, the report
said. These include minorities, elderly, chemically-dependent,
lesbians and professional women. It said these ``need special
attention and support.''
   Though depression now readily yields to treatment in 80 to 90
percent of all patients, most women with the ailment go untreated,
the report said. And for those who are treated, the depression is
misdiagnosed ``at least 30 to 50 percent of the time,'' the study
said.
   ``Approximately 70 percent of the prescriptions for
antidepressants are given to women, often with improper diagnosis
and monitoring,'' the study said. It recommended more research on
the use of antidepressant drugs for women.
   The APA task force included 34 women and five men. The group
included psychologists, physicians, mental health workers, authors
and editors, and Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo.

   Tim Burton is young, only 32. His hair is long,
too long, falling over his face and sticking out at the sides. His
dreamy eyes gaze as if a movie screen is on the distant wall. He
has a lazy grin and a nervous, unsettling laugh.
   Hardly the kind of person you'd put in charge of a major motion
picture, but Burton has managed quite well. He's one of Hollywood's
hottest properties, the director of the mega-budget, mega-smash
``Batman,'' and the offbeat hit ``Beetlejuice.''
   It makes perfect sense to him; he simply points to his high
school experience. There were three kinds of (male) students, he
recalls: athletes, very popular with the girls; academics,
preferred by the teachers; and the ``freaks,'' people meant,
perhaps, to find themselves a little later in life.
   ``I went to my 10-year high school reunion a few years ago,''
Burton recalled in a recent interview. ``It was so amazing. Some
people peaked in high school. Everybody I saw who was considered an
outcast, I didn't see one example where this wasn't true, they were
incredibly attractive and successful.
   ``You got to get it out some way. If you get everything you
want, you're not going to have those desires. You don't have that
eternal conflict of getting something out.''
   His new film, ``Edward Scissorhands,'' is a holiday fable about
a ``freak'' (Johnny Depp) rescued from his broken-down mansion high
above town and taken to the nice, suburban home of a friendly Avon
Lady, Dianne Wiest.
   A punk in whiteface and black leather, Edward was constructed by
an aging scientist (Vincent Price, of course) who died before he
could make a pair of hands. An array of scissors are there instead.
   The neighbors all take to Wiest's unusual guest, who endears
himself by using his ``hands'' to artfully trim hedges, poodles and
women's hair. But Edward also has a soul. He's in love, with
Wiest's beautiful and popular daughter (Winona Ryder, Depp's
girlfriend in real life), and must fight nasty boyfriend Anthony
Michael Hall for her affection.
   ``It's a classic fairy tale, an image of creation and of
destruction, beauty and horror, touching and not touching,'' Burton
said. ``It's an externalization of how you feel at odds with
yourself, two-sided.''
   ``Beetlejuice'' fans will appreciate the campy sets, with
brightly painted, monochromatic houses, as well as matching clothes
and billboards (food, too). Burton says he was trying to be funny
and also wanted to make a point: How people see others on just one
level, applying catchall phrases that deny any complexity.
   ``People say, `You're this, you're that.' I think there's a
necessity for people to categorize. I think it helps make them
comfortable. And some of the weirdest people I've known get it the
worst. If people can't put you into a category, they're inclined to
just write you off as a freak.''
   Burton, who grew up in Burbank, Calif., watched science-fiction
and horror films as a kid and first showed talent as an artist by
designing an anti-litter poster in ninth grade that graced the
sides of local garbage trucks.
   After high school, he attended the California Institute of the
Arts on a Disney fellowship and soon joined Walt Disney Studios as
an animator, working on ``The Fox and the Hound'' and ``The Black
Cauldron.''
   Price was the inspiration - and the narrator - for his first
film, ``Vincent,'' an animated short completed when the director
was just 23. His next project was ``Frankenweenie,'' his first live
action film.
   ``It happened just by osmosis, that need to want to do
something. I didn't care how it manifested itself. I didn't care if
it was drawing, animation, whatever. Animation was a little too
tedious for me. Live action was better because it was immediate and
helped me come out of my shell,'' he said.
   He followed with ``Pee-wee's Big Adventure'' and then
``Beetlejuice,'' the wacky ghost story that helped make stars of
Ryder, Michael Keaton, Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin.
   The script had ``no story,'' Burton recalled. It was
``incredibly vague, and contradicted itself all over the place. I
can't to this day say if it was good or not. You just felt
someone's personality in it.''
   Burton's confident he'll keep getting better. He thinks history
- Hollywood history - is on his side. Some of the great directors -
John Huston, Billy Wilder, Preston Sturges - hadn't even made films
at his age. He's still developing, still learning to express
himself.

   The Boston Symphony Orchestra will tour the United
States next spring and perform in Europe late in the summer,
conductor Seiji Ozawa said Wednesday.
   The U.S. tour, scheduled for April 22-May 3, will be the
orchestra's first transcontinental tour since 1981.
   The orchestra also has launched a series of commissions inviting
major composers to write works for the symphony, Ozawa said.
   The first of the works, a piece for brass trio and percussion by
Yehudi Wyner, will be performed by the Boston Symphony Chamber
Players in March, he said. Other commissions will feature works by
Leon Kirchner, John Harbison and Lukas Foss.
   The U.S. tour will include performances in Pittsburgh, Toronto,
Chicago, New York, Cleveland, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and
Tempe, Ariz.
   The European tour, running from Aug. 24-Sept. 8, includes stops
in Athens, Salzburg, Munich, Stuttgart, Frankfurt, Paris, and

   Both tours will be underwritten by a grant from NEC Corp., an
electronics company that sponsored the orchestra's Far East tour in
1989 and its European tour in 1988.

<HEAD>Union Asked to Let Filipino Star Recreate Role in Broadway's `Miss
Saigon'</HEAD>

   ``Miss Saigon'' producer Cameron Mackintosh, who
already has fought with Actors' Equity over ethnic casting, is
seeking permission to cast a Filipino actress in the Broadway
version of the hit London musical.
   The actress, Lea Salonga, played the role of Kim, a Vietnamese
bargirl, in the British production, but she would need the union's
approval to appear in the United States.
   Mackintosh battled the actors' union last summer when it turned
down his request to allow British actor Jonathan Pryce to recreate
his starring role of a Eurasian pimp. The ban stirred debate over
color-blind casting and minority opportunities on stage.
   The producer then canceled the $10 million show but changed his
mind when the union relented, allowing Pryce to appear here.
   The agreement between Mackintosh and the union allowed the
producer to hire two non-American Asian performers for the musical,
but said he must get special permission to let Salonga star in New
York.
   Mackintosh also agreed not to use yellow-face makeup or facial
devices designed to simulate Asian eyes in any U.S. production and
to try to recruit Asian-American actors for lesser roles in the
show.
   Mackintosh, traveling in Australia, could not be reached for
comment. His spokesman, Marc Thibodeau, confirmed Wednesday the
request to the union.
   More than 10 open auditions, in New York, Los Angeles, San
Francisco, Vancouver, British Columbia, and elsewhere, have been
held specifically for the role of Kim, he said. Salonga was chosen
for the London production after a worldwide search.
   A union committee will consider Mackintosh's request for
Salonga, said union spokeswoman Helaine Feldman, but no date for
the meeting has been set.
   If rejected, the producer could appeal to the union's 79-member
council. If that request also is denied, the matter could go to
arbitration.
   Of the nearly 50 performers in the large cast, 34 roles are
played by ethnic minority actors, including 27 Asians.
   ``Miss Saigon,'' set during the closing days of the Vietnam War,
has sold a record $30 million in advance tickets. It is scheduled
to open April 11, 1991, at the Broadway Theater.

<HEAD>Legislators Demand State of Emergency, Suspension of Parliament</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of conservative and liberal legislators
demanded Wednesday that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev impose a
state of emergency to pull the nation out of its political and
economic crisis.
   It also demanded that Gorbachev suspend the activities of
political parties and the parliaments of four republics.
   The group, called the National Salvation Committee, demanded
that the armed forces be asked to help halt the nation's slide into
chaos. But Gorbachev's main rival, Boris Yeltsin, said he was
opposed to using the military to resolve the crisis.
   The Salvation Committee's members included the hard-line Soyuz
group of parliamentarians as well as the reformist
Liberal-Democratic Party.
   ``There are many fascist elements emerging in many parts of the
country, and this process should be stopped before it is too
late,'' said Vladimir Zhirinovsky, a leader of the
Liberal-Democratic Party and a spokesman for the National Salvation
Committee.
   The committee called the military ``the sole force still
resisting the disintegration of the state,'' the independent
Interfax news agency reported.
   Leaders demanded shifting power to the committee if Gorbachev
did not act, Interfax and the state news agency Tass reported.
   ``Gorbachev must assume this responsibility or we should find an
alternative,'' said Vladimir Voronin, leader of the Sakharov
Democratic Union and a committee member.
   He said in a telephone interview that the committee wanted a
``strengthening of presidential power.''
   The group is calling for suspension of the parliaments of
Lithuania, Moldavia, Georgia and Russia, because they are seen as
the strongest challenge to the central government, Zhirinovsky said
in a telephone interview.
   Other committee members seemed inclined to suspend all
legislative bodies.
   ``If presidential decrees are not obeyed in a region, that
region's representative bodies should be dissolved, and a
plenipotentiary representative of the central government should be
sent to replace it,'' said Voronin.
   The Lithuanian parliament declared independence on March 11 and
the newly elected non-Communist parliament of Georgia is moving in
that direction. Moldavia is split among opposing ethnic groups.
   The Russian republic issued the strongest challenge by declaring
itself sovereign, with the right to overturn national laws on its
territory - three-quarters of the Soviet land mass.
   Zhirinovsky said the coalition represented 400 of the 2,250
members of the Congress of Peoples' Deputies, and included members
of the Soviet Peace Committee, the Russian National Front and the
Communist Party.
   He said the proposal for introducing a state of emergency
starting Jan. 1 would be introduced at the next session of the
Congress, on Dec. 17.
   Tass said the group's program ``surprised journalists and even
some members of the bloc, who were already disagreeing with some
provisions during the press conference.''
   Sentiment for a crackdown is widespread in the Communist Party,
which holds a majority in most legislative bodies on the national
and local level. Many Communists want Gorbachev to call a state of
emergency and enforce it through the armed forces and the KGB
security police.
   The National Salvation Committee seemed to have the same goals,
although they were not spelled out clearly during the news
conference called to announce the group's formation.
   The Soviet economy is crumbling. The old central system is
failing and grocery shelves in major cities are bare.
   With all but one of the 15 Soviet republics seeking some form of
independence or autonomy from central government, many officials
fear the collapse of the union.
   Yeltsin, president of the Russian republic and Gorbachev's main
rival, warned officers at the Dzerzhinsky Military Academy in
Moscow against a military coup.
   ``If the army enters our boiling society as an active factor,
confrontation will increase many times and carry the society to
catastrophe,'' he said.
   ``First of all, the army cannot solve the economic problem, and
today the economy is the greatest concern,'' he said.
   Yeltsin said ``any interference by the army in internal
political affairs will simply blow up the army from inside. It
could split into small groups fighting each other.''
   ``The tough political struggle, which today remains peaceful,
could grow into an armed conflict,'' he said. ``Taking into account
that we are a nuclear power, such a development would immediately
create a threat not only to life in our country but in the whole
world.''
   Yeltsin has led the drive for shifting power from the central
government to the republics. As a result, hard-liners feel he has
contributed to forces splintering the country.

this year, announced a new schedule Wednesday of 27 flights in the
next three years.
   The schedule includes seven shuttle launches in 1991, eight in

destroyed Challenger, will join the fleet in 1992 and its first
mission will be to reboost a stranded satellite.
   In the three-year period, NASA also plans to launch 13 rockets.
Their payloads include three major scientific probes - the Extreme
Ultraviolet Explorer and Geotail on Delta 2 rockets, and the Mars
Observer on the larger Titan III.
   For the first time, there are no secret Defense Department
launches on the schedule. But unclassified military cargoes are
slated for three flights, including the first one next year.

   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was reportedly offering Wednesday
to put ``all issues'' on the negotiating table, but President Bush
said he's not optimistic about prospects for an Iraqi withdrawal
from Kuwait.
   Saddam's latest surprise came as top Bush administration aides
warned that Iraq must pull out of Kuwait or face the prospect of a
devastating military strike.
   Israel, too, gave Saddam one of its most forceful warnings to
date, saying it would ``destroy his security, hurt him until he is
sorry'' if he used current peace moves as a cover for aggression
against the Jewish state.
   The Cable News Network said Saddam was feeling enormous pressure
to withdraw from Kuwait, and quoted a ranking Iraqi source it did
not identify as saying, ``All issues are on the table,
everything.''
   Bush, on a South American visit, was asked about the report.
   ``I'm not optimistic. I see no evidence Saddam Hussein is
willing to comply fully with the U.N. resolutions,'' he told
reporters in Argentina. Those resolutions call for an unconditional
withdrawal of Iraqi troops from the emirate, the freeing of foreign
hostages and the restoration of the former Kuwaiti government.
   The report - and word from the State Department that Iraq had
formally accepted an offer for talks - sent crude oil prices for
January delivery down more than $3 a barrel to $27.29 on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. That was the lowest level since August,
the month Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   The Bush administration had offered last week to send Secretary
of State James A. Baker III to Baghdad and invited Iraqi Foreign
Minister Tariq Aziz to Washington. Iraq indicated earlier it would
accept, and the State Department announcement formalized that. The
department said the dates were being worked out.
   The Bush administration has said the talks are to reiterate what
U.N. resolutions say, and are not meant to be wide-ranging
negotiations. Iraq says it wants to bring in other Middle East
issues, including the Arab-Israeli conflict, but the Bush
administration has ruled that out.
   Moscow, meanwhile, was making conciliatory moves, agreeing to
discuss compensation payments to Iraq. The move came as the Baghdad
government prepared to begin freeing more than 3,200 Soviet
citizens.
   The Soviets are among thousands of foreigners who were trapped
by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. On Wednesday, a group of
American women arrived in Baghdad and said they hoped to win the
release of their hostage husbands.
   ``Saddam told us if we come here we will not go back
empty-handed,'' said Dawn Bazner of Detroit after arriving in the
Iraqi capital.
   The State Department has discouraged private hostage-freeing
missions, saying the emissaries put themselves in danger and also
risk being used for propaganda purposes.
   In a series of statements Wednesday, Baker, CIA director William
Webster and Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, all took a tough position on what might happen if Iraq
refuses to give up Kuwait.
   ``The United States is not going to blink on this one,'' Powell
said in a speech at a London research institute.
   ``If we have to use force, if it comes to that ... the United
States intends to use overwhelming force to win decisively, as
quickly as possible with as few casualties as possible,'' he said.
   Baker, appearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
stopped short of saying the United States would strike militarily
if Iraq still holds Kuwait after Jan. 15, the deadline for
withdrawal established last week by the United Nations Security
Council.
   But if force must be used, ``it will be used suddenly, massively
and decisively,'' he said.
   Baker said so far, U.N.-imposed sanctions have had little effect
on Iraq's ``inclination to withdraw'' from Kuwait, which it overran
Aug. 2.
   Webster voiced similar sentiments in an appearance before the
House Armed Services Committee. He said it would be risky to rely
on sanctions alone to get Iraq to relinquish Kuwait.
   ``There is no assurance or guarantee that economic hardships
will compel Saddam to change his policies,'' he said.
   Congress has been pressing the administration to seek its
approval before going to war in the gulf.
   In Baghdad, a Soviet diplomat said more than 200 exit visas were
issued Wednesday for Soviet citizens, and that an evacuation flight
was set for Thursday.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Vitaly Churkin said the
Kremlin was willing to discuss compensation payments for Iraq for
allowing Soviet citizens to leave before their work contracts
expired.
   The Baghdad government made its demand for compensation earlier
this week, when it announced more than 3,200 Soviet experts would
be allowed to go home.
   The Israeli warning to Saddam came from Foreign Minister David
Levy, in remarks to lawmakers. His coments reflected the apparent
unease of Israeli officials at the prospect of a resolution of the
gulf crisis that would leave the Iraqi president's army and
missiles intact.
   ``If anyone thinks that through some maneuver in the name of
peace he will be able to continue to threaten with the aim of
surprising Israel, he will find Israel ready, always, with its
might, to destroy his security, to hurt him until he is sorry and
regrets his action,'' Levy said.
   British officials said Wednesday a 57-year-old British man held
by Irq at a strategic site had died in captivity. He died Tuesday
of an apparent heart attack, they said.

   A newly elected state legislator must give
up his seat when he goes to serve in the Persian Gulf with his
National Guard unit under a ban included in the state constitution.
   Robert Porter is a member of the Guard's 744th Transportation
Company, which was called up last month.
   The state constitution bars legislators from serving while they
are on active military duty. Republican House Speaker Harold Burns
says that's unfair.
   ``If you've done the patriotic thing and gone to serve, to have
your House seat taken away from you is ridiculous,'' he said.
``That's one of the worst things I've ever heard. It's almost evil,
and I would do everything in my power to change it.''
   Porter, a Republican, couldn't be sworn in Wednesday along with
other House members because he is training at Fort Devens in Ayer,
Mass.
   Burns said he would support a change in the constitution to
ensure lawmakers who are called to serve will still have their
seats when they return. He and other Republican leaders say they
hope no one calls for a special election to fill Porter's seat.
   Changing the constitution requires either a vote by the
Legislature or a constitutional convention vote. In either case,
voters must ratify the change.
   ``We could change this in 1992, but unfortunately that doesn't
help Rep. Porter,'' Burns said.

   Here are excerpts from the opening statement
of Secretary of State James A. Baker III before the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee on Wednesday.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   From the outset, the international community has rallied behind
four objectives: first, the immediate, complete and unconditional
Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait; second, the restoration of Kuwait's
legitimate government; third, the release of all hostages; and
fourth, a commitment to the security and stability of the Gulf.
   The president has stated repeatedly, Mr. Chairman, that we want
to achieve these objectives peacefully. He has also made clear that
we seek to achieve them at the least cost to ourselves and at the
least cost to other members of the international coalition.
   From the outset, our strategy to achieve these objectives has
been to make Saddam Hussein pay such a high price for his
aggression that he would quit Kuwait. We have aimed to impose costs
on him for his aggression by taking increasingly harsh steps on a
continuum of pressure and pain, politically, economically, and
militarily. On this continuum, economic sanctions and military
preparations are not alternatives, but are really reinforcing and
escalating steps of the same strategy.
   Notwithstanding our desire for peace, from the outset we have
proceeded with the full realization that if these objectives cannot
be achieved peacefully, then we really must be prepared to use
force, given the vital interests that we have at stake. ...
   To date, the international coalition has had considerable
success in isolating Iraq and in making it pay high costs for its
occupation of Kuwait. We regret the pain that this causes the
innocent citizens of Iraq, a people with whom we have no quarrel.
   But the question before us now is whether the costs we impose on
Saddam Hussein through sanctions alone will be high enough to cause
him to withdraw peacefully from Kuwait.
   Mr. Chairman, we have to face the fact that four months into
this conflict, none of our efforts have yet produced any sign of
change in Saddam Hussein. He shows no signs of complying with any
of the Security Council resolutions. Instead, he appears to be
doubling his bets.
   He has tried to make Kuwait part of Iraq, systematically looting
and dismembering a sovereign Arab state. He has been terrorizing
the population, his soldiers committing unspeakable crimes against
innocent Kuwaitis.
   He has called for the overthrow of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and
President Mubarak of Egypt, he has threatened to rain terror and
mass destruction on his Arab neighbors, as well as on Israel, and
he has been playing the cruelest of games with hostages and their
families and with our diplomats in Kuwait.
   After serious and sobering consultations, the United Nations
Security Council last Thursday passed, by an overwhelming majority,
a 12th resolution, one that authorizes all necessary means,
including the use of force, to eject Iraq from Kuwait after January
15, 1991.
   In passing this resolution, the international community is
giving Saddam yet another chance - indeed, one last chance - to
come to his senses.
   In passing Thursday's resolution, the international community
sends the following clear message: We continue to seek a diplomatic
solution. Peace is your only sensible option. You can choose peace
by respecting the will of the international community, but if you
fail to do so, you will risk all. The choice is yours.
   To ensure, Mr. Chairman, that he understands this choice, the
president has invited the Foreign Minister of Iraq to Washington
and has directed me to go to Baghdad. Put bluntly, this is the
last, best chance for a peaceful solution. If we are to have any
chance of success, I must go to Baghdad, Mr. Chairman, with the
full support of the Congress and the American people behind the
message of the international community.
   Let me be clear: This meeting will not be the beginning of a
negotiation over the terms of the United Nations resolutions. Those
terms are clear - a complete, immediate, and unconditional
withdrawal from Kuwait, the restoration of the legitimate Kuwaiti
government, and the release of all foreign nationals.
   Nor is this the beginning of a negotiation on subjects which are
unrelated to Iraq's brutal occupation of Kuwait. I will not be
negotiating the Palestinian question or the civil war in Lebanon.
   Saddam Hussein did not invade Kuwait to help the Palestinians.
He did it for his own self-aggrandizement. And as Eduard
Shevardnadze has said, Mr. Chairman, you do not enslave one people
to free another.
   Put simply, my mission to Baghdad will be an attempt to explain
to Saddam the choice he faces: comply with the objectives of the
Security Council, or risk disaster for Iraq.
   To give substance to these words, the president has directed the
secretary of defense, the chairman of the joint chiefs, and me to
work with the other members of the international coalition to
reinforce the multinational force in the Gulf and to coordinate its
efforts. Our aim is to ensure that if force must be used, it will
be used suddenly, massively, and decisively.
   Do the troop reinforcements and the Security Council resolution
mean that war is inevitable? Surely not. There is a peaceful
solution possible, one that does not reward aggression, and
everyone, including Saddam Hussein, knows what that is. He can
choose peace by withdrawing unconditionally from Kuwait and by
releasing all hostages.
   He will not make that peaceful choice, however, in our opinion,
unless he understands that the alternative to peaceful compliance
is that he will be forced to comply. That is the message that we
are trying, in every way we know how, to send him. That is the
meaning of the steps the international community has taken over the
past month. It is not a new strategy, but rather, a continuation
and reinforcement of the strategy that we have been pursuing since
August.
   Now, I know that some here and throughout the country are very
uneasy about the prospects of war. Mr. Chairman, no one wants war.
None of us. Not you, not the president, not me, none of us. None of
us, though, have sought this conflict. And we are making every
attempt possible to resolve it peacefully; to resolve it peacefully
without appeasing the aggressor.
   I know the arguments of those who believe that time and the
economic embargo alone will work to resolve this conflict
peacefully. But, I think we have to face some very hard facts. If
sanctions are to succeed, they've got to do more than simply hurt
Iraq economically. They must hurt Iraq so much that Saddam Hussein
changes his behavior and withdraws from Kuwait. That is the
criterion of success by which sanctions must be judged.
   In considering the role of sanctions and our strategy, we need
to ask ourselves: Can economic sanctions alone compel a dictator
like Saddam Hussein to make the politically difficult choice of
withdrawing from Kuwait? Absent a credible military threat, will he
take the Security Council's actions seriously? Is there anything in
Saddam Hussein's history that could lead us to believe that
sanctions alone would get him out of Kuwait?

   Americans and Canadians of Polish origin are not
eligible to vote in the second round of Poland's presidential
elections, an official at the Polish Consulate here said Wednesday.
   ``The second election takes place only in Poland,'' said the
official, Krzysztof Smyk. ``That is the Polish law.''
   Smyk said the consulate has not received any complaints about
Sunday's balloting because ``people know the regulations. We
informed them in the first round of voting.
   ``This regulation was undertaken by the Polish Parliament before
the voting began.''
   But some Polish Canadians are disappointed they won't be able to
vote, said Janusz Sukiennik, editor-in-chief of the Toronto-based
Polish Alliance Press.
   ``I can feel some disappointment (among the people), especially
now when the campaign is getting emotional. But that is the law,
and we can not change it.''
   Presidential candidate Lech Walesa was easily leading emigre
businessman Stanislaw Tyminski, who holds Canadian and Peruvian
citizenship, in the latest poll with 61 percent versus 20 percent
for Tyminski.
   The controversial Tyminski, who only returned to his homeland
this fall after 21 years overseas, took second place over Tadeusz
Mazowiecki in the first round of voting on Nov. 25, eliminating the
prime minister from this week's runoff.
   About 5,000 Polish Canadians cast their ballots in Toronto in
the first round of voting.
   It was unknown how many Polish Americans cast their vote.

<HEAD>WASHN: of Kuwait?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   And Mr. Chairman, if I might, let me try to answer these
questions based on the results so far. After four months of a
stringent embargo, no one doubts that sanctions are having some
effect on the Iraqi economy, but we have o face the difficult
fact, I think, that no one can tell you that sanctions alone will
ever be able to impose a high enough cost on Saddam Hussein to get
him to withdraw.
   So far, all available evidence suggests that they have had
little, if any, effect on his inclination to withdraw. That's in
part because Saddam, to a considerable extent, can decide who in
Iraq gets hurt by the sanctions. And you can bet the Iraqi people
will feel the pain first and most deeply, not the Iraqi military,
and not the government of Iraq itself.
   Saddam has a long history of imposing great pain and suffering
on the Iraqi people. It is not new for him to impose economic
sacrifices on the Iraqi people in pursuit of his ambitions. So we
need to remember who it is we are trying to get out of Kuwait.
   He is a ruthless dictator. He has an inflated sense of Iraq's
leverage and a very high pain threshold. He undoubtedly believes he
can endure economic sanctions. However, surely he understands more
acutely the consequence or the consequences of military force.
Waiting not only gives him time to break the sanctions, but
waiting, Mr. Chairman, imposes costs on us. As we wait, Saddam will
continue torturing Kuwait and continue killing it as a nation.
   As we wait, he will continue manipulating hostages, attempting
to break the coalition. As we wait, he will continue to fortify
Kuwait; he will continue to build chemical and biological weapons
and he will continue his efforts to acquire a nuclear weapons
capability. As we wait, he expects other issues to deflect our
attention, to weaken our resolve, and to dissolve the international
coalition. And as we wait, Mr. Chairman, his crime weighs heavier
on the world.
   And so that is why we think we must make credible our
preparations to use force. The international community has clearly
agreed that force will not be used before January 15 of next year,
provided, of course, that there is no provocation in the
intervening time frame. Thus, Mr. Chairman, we need to remind
ourselves that for now no one is making a decision about going to
war. Indeed, in asking me to go to Baghdad, the president has made
it clear that he will use the next six weeks to exhaust all
diplomatic opportunities.
   But to support these diplomatic efforts, Mr. Chairman, the
president has also made it clear that we need continued support for
our military preparations to make credible an offensive option to
liberate Kuwait.
   While not prejudging any decision whether force should be used
sometime after January 15, I can state, unequivocally, that failure
to continue preparations now has at least three dangerous
consequences: First, it would undercut our diplomatic leverage, by
removing the other alternative to a peaceful withdrawal, which is
use of force. It would send Iraq exactly the wrong message; that
is, ``Continue to play for time; you'll have lots of it because the
Security Council resolution is just a bluff. The international
coalition is not even preparing the option to use force, let alone,
take that option.''
   That is a message, Mr. Chairman, that we should not and must not
send. We must show Saddam Hussein that time is not on his side. He
needs to know that even if he believes he can withstand the
sanctions, and he may well be right in this belief, we can and will
impose even greater costs on him through the use of force if that
is necessary.
   Secondly, the failure to prepare a credible offensive military
option would only tend to reaffirm the status quo and to legitimize
to some the brutal occupation that he is now carrying out against
Kuwait and its people.
   Third, the failure to prepare adequately now would mean that
should conflict come, we would be irresponsibly risking greater
casualties, putting the lives of those young Americans already on
the front lines in the Persian Gulf at greater risk than they need
to be. The president will not stand for that and neither, Mr.
Chairman, I submit, will the American people.
   Mr. Chairman, we do not proceed along this pass unaware of the
dangers and the risks that are involved. But let there be no doubt
that succeeding in this endeavor, hopefully in peace, if necessary
by force, is in the vital interests of the American people. It is
often said that there has been no clear answer given to the
question of why we are in the Gulf.
   Much of this, I think, results from the search for a single
cause for our involvement, a single reason the president could use
to explain why the lives of American men and women should be put in
harm's way in the sands of Arabia, on the seas around it or in the
air above it.
   Mr. Chairman, let's stop this search and let's be honest with
ourselves and with each other. There are multiple causes, there are
multiple dangers, there are multiple threats, and standing alone
each is compelling, but you put them all together and the case is
overwhelming. Put very bluntly, a very dangerous dictator, armed to
the teeth, is threatening a critical region at a defining moment in
history. It is the combination of these reasons, that is, who is
threatening our interests, what capabilities he has and is
developing, where he is carrying out his aggression, and when he
has chosen to act that make the stakes so very high for all of us.
   Let me explain. Strategically, this man is a capricious dictator
whose lust for power is as unlimited as his brutality in the
pursuit of it. He has invaded two neighbors, he is harboring
terrorists, and now is systematically exterminating Kuwait. He uses
poison gas even against his own people. He develops deadly toxins.
And he seeks relentlessly to acquire nuclear bombs. He has built
the world's sixth largest army, has the world's fifth largest tank
army, and has deployed ballistic missiles.
   Geographically, Saddam's aggression has occurred in a political
tinderbox that is crossroads to three continents. His success would
only guarantee more strife, more conflict, and eventually a wider
war. There would be little hope for any effort at peacemaking in
the Middle East.
   Economically, his aggression imperils the world's oil lifelines
here and abroad, hitting hardest those fledgling democracies that
are least able to cope with it. His aggression is an attempt to
mortgage the economic promise of the post-cold war world to the
whims of a single man.
   Morally, we must act so that international laws, not
international outlaws, govern the post-Cold War world. We must act
so that right, not might, dictates success in the post-Cold War
world. We must act so that innocent men and women and diplomats are
protected, not held hostage, in the post-Cold War world.
   Historically, we must stand with the people of Kuwait so that
the annexation of Kuwait does not become the first reality that
mars our vision of a new world order. We must stand with the world
community so that the United Nations does not go the same way as
the League of Nations.
   Politically, Mr. Chairman, finally politically, we must stand
for American leadership - not because we seek it, but simply
because no one else can do the job. And we did not stand united for
40 years to bring the Cold War to a peaceful end in order to make
the world safe for the likes of Saddam Hussein.
   So these, then, are the stakes, Mr. Chairman. If he is not
stopped now, if his aggressive designs are not frustrated
peacefully if possible or if necessary by force, we will all pay a
much higher price later on. As the Security Council did last
Thursday, this Congress and the American people must tell Saddam
Hussein in unmistakable actions and words: Get out of Kuwait now or
risk all.
   Mr. Chairman, now more than at any time during this conflict, it
is important that we stand united with the world community in full
support of the United Nations Security Council resolutions. Simply
put, it is a choice between what's right and what's wrong - between
what's right and what's wrong. And, Mr. Chairman, I think that we
have the courage and the fortitude to do what's right. Thank you
very much.

<HEAD>Hotel Alleges Saudi Prince Failed To Pay for Damages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY ROGERS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A globe-trotting Saudi prince has run
afoul of a Florida hotel that claims his highness failed to pay for
damages left during a stay last spring.
   Prince Turki Bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud, the youngest of King Fahd's
six brothers, who now occupies two floors of the Charles Hotel in
Cambridge with his retinue of 65, is being sued by the Hyatt
Regency Grand Cypress hotel in Orlando, Fla.
   During a nearly monthlong stay in more than 30 rooms last
spring, the prince and his entourage scratched pianos, left stains
and damaged a ceiling, the hotel alleges.
   The lawsuit filed in Orlando Circuit Court also says the prince
failed to pick up the tab for Hyatt guests who had to be moved to
other rooms after the royal family extended its stay twice. The
hotel is seeking $20,000 in charges and damages.
   Originally the Hyatt management had been willing to accept
$7,500 for the damages, said Denis L. Durkin, a lawyer for the
hotel. The royal family accepted the offer but never paid, he said.
   James A. Hauser, a lawyer for Prince Turki, on Wednesday called
the lawsuit a misunderstanding that arose because hotel management
failed to bring the damages to the attention of the prince's
administrative staff.
   ``There was never a problem while the family was staying
there,'' Hauser said. ``After they left there arose some
allegations or claims for repairs and relocation expenses.
   ``But none of those items had ever been brought to the attention
of the royal family or the man who pays the bills. It's one of
those things where the communication doesn't make it from A to B to
C.''
   Hauser said he expected the lawsuit would be resolved quickly.
   The prince, who has started a public relations campaign to
change his image as troublesome, has managed to stay on good terms
with management at the Charles.
   ``Everything here is fine,'' said hotel spokeswoman Martha
Sullivan. ``We think he's a model guest, and we have no
complaints.''
   Still, others have complained.
   In October, Cambridge residents complained that the prince's
security guards ejected local children from a park during royal
family visits. They also claimed the Saudis drove stretch
limousines across newly-seeded athletic fields.

<TEXT>
   Rep. Edolphus ``Ed'' Towns, a liberal Democrat
from Brooklyn, N.Y., was elected chairman Wednesday of the
Congressional Black Caucus for the 102nd Congress.
   ``It's official. You can give me your condolences,'' Towns joked
after the vote.
   He will succeed Rep. Ronald V. Dellums, D-Calif.
   Towns, elected to a fifth term last month, said the caucus will
meet early in the new Congress to discuss its goals.
   ``The civil rights bill will be something we will push very hard
very early in the Congress,'' he said in an interview.
   The bill was defeated this year when the Senate failed, by one
vote, to override President Bush's veto.
   Towns noted that the caucus will have 26 members next year, the
most since it was founded in 1970. In addition, it will have its
first Republican U.S. representative ever: freshman Gary Franks,
R-Conn.
   ``We look forward to working with him,'' Towns said. ``It might
take us a little longer to get things done, but that's good.''
   Towns, 56, was elected to Congress in 1982 from a diverse
district that includes the impoverished Bedford-Stuyvesant section
as well as the wealthier Brooklyn Heights neighborhood.
   In Congress, Towns has established himself as a solid liberal,
in touch with his constituents but above the political infighting
of his district.

<TEXT>
   Scientists plan to install a $4 million
observatory on an underwater volcano, complete with cameras,
microphones and seismometers to monitor the gradual birth of the
next Hawaiian island.
   University of Hawaii researchers hope the Hawaiian Undersea
Geo-Observatory, or HUGO, will be in place on Loihi seamount within
two years, using its instruments to study earthquakes and
eruptions, geology and geophysics professor Fred K. Duennebier said
Wednesday.
   ``It's a good idea to monitor undersea volcanoes,'' said Bob
Tilling, a U.S. Geological Survey volcanologist. ``More than half
the world's volcanoes are on the sea floor. The challenge is to
capture one of these erupting because we haven't done that yet.''
   Loihi is a rugged, steep-sided submarine volcano about 22 miles
southeast of the Island of Hawaii. It rises roughly 11,200 feet
above the surrounding sea floor. Its cratered summit is now about
3,300 feet beneath the surface of the Pacific, Duennebier said.
   Volcanologists are certain it is active but haven't actually
observed an eruption. Intense earthquake activity suggests
eruptions happened in 1986, 1988 and early this year, Duennebier
said during the American Geophysical Union's fall meeting.
   ``It will be the next Hawaiian island in about 50,000 years or
so'' once eruptions build the summit above the ocean's surface, he
added. ``I wouldn't buy real estate yet.''
   The observatory will be a network of 20 or more cameras and
instruments plugged into electrical boxes located on a system of
electro-optical cables draped across Loihi's summit and slopes -
like TVs, lamps and stereo equipment linked by extension cords in
someone's living room.
   HUGO will be connected to the Big Island by another cable that
will provide power and also carry data from the observatory to a
recording station and scientists on shore.
   Duennebier said that once a ship lays the cable and boxes,
unmanned remote-controlled submarines and manned submersible
vehicles will plug cameras, microphones, seismometers and heat and
chemical sensors into the network.
   Scientists who study the sea floor now usually use instruments
that are dropped off ships, fall to the ocean floor, record
scientific data on tape and then are recovered by ships.
   Duennebier said HUGO's instruments will have the advantage of
being able to collect data on quakes and eruptions and send the
information to land immediately. If a camera or instrument breaks
down or becomes obsolete, a submersible vehicle or
remote-controlled submarine can retrieve it and install a new one.
   The observatory will be able to collect pictures and information
for at least 10 years unless it is buried by undersea lava flows or
landslides, Duennebier said. He said the instruments would be
placed in areas where they are least likely to be damaged.
   During the apparent eruption of Loihi in 1986, the university
installed seven temporary seismometers on Loihi's slopes. They
detected thousands of earthquakes at the rate of about three daily,
while seismometers on land detected only three per month.
Duennebier said that shows the value of installing a permanent
observatory like HUGO.
   The Hawaiian Islands were created by a ``hot spot,'' a plume of
molten rock that rises from deep inside the Earth. As a giant plate
of Earth's crust was dragged over the hot spot, volcanic eruptions
from the hot spot formed each of the islands in succession.
   Loihi is now over the hot spot, which also has branches feeding
Hawaii's Kilauea and Mauna Loa volcanoes.
   The network of cables and electrical plug-in boxes for the
observatory will cost roughly $4 million, although about two-thirds
of that cost has been donated by AT&amp;T Co. in the form of 25 miles
of undersea cable and the use of a cable-laying ship to install it.
   The university also got $100,000 of $2.5 million it requested
for the project from the National Science Foundation. Duennebier
and his colleague, oceanographer Alexander Malahoff, hope to use
that money to start buying cameras and monitoring instruments for
the observatory.
   Because the observatory will be equipped with numerous plug-in
boxes, many other researchers will be able to install their own
instruments on Loihi, Duennebier said.

<HEAD>Saddam Calls for Dialogue With America, Criticizes Bush</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saddam Hussein said Wednesday that Iraq
wants dialogue with other nations, but he indicated a settlement in
the Persian Gulf still hinges on a larger solution to Mideast
problems.
   The official Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, said
President Saddam told visiting European parliamentarians that Iraq
rejects ultimatums from the Bush administration.
   Bush has demanded that Iraq withdraw from Kuwait without
precondition and has threatened through the passage of a U.N.
resolution last week to wage war if Iraqi forces haven't left
Kuwaiti territory by Jan. 15. Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and
days later declared it to be an Iraqi province.
   ``What guarantees legitimate interests among people and honest
ties among nations is not threats, the use of force or bribes but
the building of a human bridge based on love,'' the Iraqi news
agency quoted Saddam as saying.
   ``The foundations of this bridge should be dialogue and
interaction through dialogue to attain a common understanding and
solutions based on convictions.''
   It said Saddam stressed Iraq's determination to confront ``any
attempt to threaten, intimidate and brandish the use of brute
force, regardless of the direction from which it comes.''
   In Argentina, Bush said Wednesday he is ``not optimistic'' that
a peaceful solution can be found. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, Gen. Colin Powell, said in London that America ``is not
going to blink on this one.''
   Iraq has insisted that any solution must include a settlement of
such Mideast problems as the Palestinian homeland. It argues that
enforcing U.N. Security Council resolutions against Iraq but not
those against Israel represents an unacceptable double standard.
   Saddam reiterated the link between the gulf crisis and other
Mideast problems Tuesday during a meeting in Baghdad with King
Hussein of Jordan, Palestine Liberation Organization chairman
Yassir Arafat and Yemeni Vice President Ali Salem Al-Beidh.
   The Iraqi news agency said the four leaders welcome dialogue but
affirmed their commitment to work toward solving all the problems
in the area, particularly over the Palestinians in Israel.
   The United States and the other countries contributing to the
anti-Iraqi multinational force have rejected linking the gulf
crisis to other Mideast problems.
   The Iraqi news agency also said Saddam criticized Bush during
the meeting with the Europeans.
   ``The president of a state that claims to be free and democratic
does not have the right to turn into an informing policeman at the
U.N. Security Council. He has to seek dialogue. This is what Iraq
wants,'' Saddam was quoted as saying.
   Also Wednesday, the Cable News Network quoted a ranking Iraqi
source it did not identify as saying, ``All issues are on the
table, everything.'' It said Saddam was feeling enormous pressure
to withdraw from Kuwait.

<HEAD>Soviet Newspaper Details Organized Crime in Moscow</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The business newspaper Commersant on Wednesday
published a map of neighborhoods in the Soviet capital that it said
are controlled by 10 major criminal organizations and ran a ``Who's
Who of Moscow racketeers.''
   The weekly said, ``Whenever the supply of a product is forcibly
kept below demand - such as narcotics in the West or alcohol during
prohibition - organized crime steps in and thrives.
   ``But in a country such as the Soviet Union where virtually
everything is difficult to obtain, the opportunities for organized
crime are endless. Couple that with an overstretched police force
and you have an explosive situation.''
   Commersant said it got its information from anonymous
informants. It said journalists who wrote the stories didn't want
their names used for fear of gangland retribution.
   The paper said it sent a copy of its map and stories in advance
to Moscow's Internal Affairs Department for comment, and the
department replied two days later that ``organized crime does not
exist as such in Moscow.''
   But Commersant said organized crime controls some or all of
Moscow's drug trade, prostitution, slot machines, video salons and
used-car sales. Its main business, however, is extorting protection
money, the paper reported - mostly from restaurants and other
semiprivate enterprises.
   Boris Pugo, the country's new interior minister, told the
government newspaper Izvestia on Tuesday that President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev is ``very concerned with the rise in organized crime.
However, the struggle with this crime hasn't been effective enough
so far.''
   ``Corruption has penetrated all organizations, all bodies of
power, including the highest echelons,'' Pugo said.
   Commersant said the two biggest and most senior gangs in Moscow
held a 1988 ``gangster summit'' to divide up the city, spelling out
who would operate where. That attempt soon broke down, it said, and
now 10 major gangs operate. It said they are known as teams or
brigades and involve about 6,000 criminals.
   The paper gave this breakdown:
   -The Assyrian Brigade monopolizes illegal drug trade, operating
out of the central Krasnaya Presnya district, home to the Moscow
Zoo and embassies.
   -The Dolgoprudnay Brigade specializes in racketeering,
especially protection. It controls northern Moscow and parts of the
Olympic Village.
   -The Solntsevo Brigade victimizes used-car sales people and is
moving in on extorting protection money from cab drivers. It
recently staked a claim on Yuzhny Port on the Moscow River.
   -The Lyubertsy and Chechen Brigades share prostitution.
   -Anton's Brigade runs loansharking and controls downtown Moscow,
all the video salons and revenues from pop music shows.
   -One brigade leader controls the income from all slot machines
in southwestern Moscow's Gagarinsky district and other parts of the
capital.
   The newspaper said other gangs control warehouses and hard
currency restaurants, black market leather and fur, shell games,
counterfeiting and shaking down vodka salesmen.

<HEAD>Saudi-Soviet Ties Blossoming Fast Due to Gulf Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ABDULLAH AL-SHERI</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Relations between Saudi Arabia and
the Soviet Union are blossoming due to the Persian Gulf crisis,
with both countries eager to open embassies and a
multibillion-dollar loan to the Soviets reportedly in the works.
   The swift rapprochement follows nearly 60 years of diplomatic
standoff between Moscow and Riyadh, which had no formal ties since
the severing of relations by Josef Stalin in 1932.
   The two nations now have much at stake in the swift development
of relations, reestablished by Saudi Arabia on Sept. 17.
   The Saudis hope to ensure Soviet support for the multinational
coalition arrayed against Iraq, once one of Moscow's closest
allies. The Soviets, for their part, are counting on financial help
from the oil-rich Arab kingdom to ease their economic crisis.
   According to official sources, the Soviets plan to send a
delegation to Riyadh this month to look for embassy premises and
hold talks on a badly needed loan.
   A Saudi delegation led by the Foreign Ministry's undersecretary
for financial and administrative affairs, Mohammed Hussein
Abdul-Wali, has been shopping in Moscow for a suitable site for a
Saudi embassy, said the sources, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The Saudi foreign minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, an infrequent
visitor to Moscow, was in the Soviet capital in the critical days
before the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution on Nov. 30
authorizing military force against Iraq.
   Finance Minister Mohammed Abalkhail was part of that delegation,
sparking reports of negotiations for a multibillion-dollar Saudi
loan to the Soviet Union, and even heftier assistance from the six
oil-rich states forming the Gulf Cooperation Council.
   The unofficial reports mentioned loans of $1 billion to $4.5
billion from Saudi Arabia alone.
   Kuwait has had relations with Moscow since shortly after gaining
independence from Britain in 1961. For years it tried to influence
its conservative Arab neighbors to do likewise.
   Under pressure of the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war, Oman and the United
Arab Emirates established ties with the Soviet Union, as well as
with China and the East European bloc nations in the early 1980s.
Qatar followed in the late 1980s.
   Under pressure of the gulf crisis, Saudi Arabia finally dropped
its resistance and announced the establishment of ties on Sept. 17,
and Bahrain followed on Sept. 28.

   A man who spent four years in prison for
breaking into a garage and trying to steal a snow blower filched 15
more soon after his release, police said.
   The 27-year-old man broke into 76 garages in Milwaukee and
suburban Wauwatosa between Nov. 7 and Nov. 25 and stole the snow
blowers, which he sold in bars and gasoline stations, police
Detective Thomas Radomski said.
   Ronald D. Gatson sold them for about $75 each to support a
cocaine habit that cost him about $300 a day, a criminal complaint
said. The complaint accuses Gatson of stealing a station wagon to
drive to the burglary locations, then removing only items that fit
into his car and could be sold quickly.
   He was charged Nov. 28 with four counts of burglary and one
count of operating an auto without owner's consent. He remains in
jail in lieu of a $2,500 bond.

<TEXT>
   The United States and Pakistan are
trying quiet diplomacy this week to restart a half-billion-dollar
aid package and redefine a 40-year-old relationship erected on Cold
War foundations.
   As the vitriolic anti-America slogans of past weeks begin to
fade, Washington and Islamabad are searching for ways to break the
impasse over Pakistan's nuclear program, the biggest source of
friction between the two long-time allies.
   On Oct. 1, President Bush said he could not guarantee Congress
that Pakistan does not possess nor wants to possess nuclear
weapons, automatically freezing economic and military assistance.
   Pakistan, one of Washington's best friends in the Islamic world,
reacted strongly to the suspension, partly blamed on the
``pro-American'' policies of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto before
her Aug. 6 ouster on corruption charges.
   Teresita Schaffer, a deputy assistant secretary of state,
arrives Thursday for talks with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's
month-old government on a wide range of issues, including the
impasse on the nuclear program.
   Henry Rowen, an assistant secretary of defense, is expected next
week.
   U.S. officials say the problems are not insurmountable, but they
acknowledge that neither side has much room to maneuver.
   Few people expect Islamabad to back down on its nuclear program
and Congress appears in no mood to make concessions - a stalemate
that some Western diplomats fear could reshape alliances in the
region by pushing Pakistan closer to its western neighbor, Iran.
   Many anaylsts and diplomats believe the cutoff of U.S. aid and
Washington's ultimatum would leave Pakistan with no option but to
accelerate its nuclear program, declare itself a nuclear state and
test an atomic device.
   Neither Pakistani nor American officials are willing to be
specific about what Islamabad allegedly did that prompted the aid
suspension. But diplomatic sources say President Ghulam Ishaq Khan,
Ms. Bhutto and top-ranking military leaders decided last spring to
cross the nuclear threshold.
   With the threat looming of a fourth war with its traditionally
antagonistic eastern neighbor India, they agreed to step up
Pakistan's secret program to enrich uranium for possible use in
nuclear weapons.
   Islamabad insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes
and accuses Washington of turning a blind eye to the nuclear
programs of other countries, including Israel, South Africa and
more importantly India, which tested a nuclear device in 1974.
   ``A nuclear-capable India breathing down the neck of Pakistan
hardly makes an easy equation,'' said retired Brig. Gen. A.R.
Siddiqi. ``The resulting strategic imbalance could throw South Asia
into a situation where the quest for security takes precedence over
the quest for abiding peace and reconciliation.''
   Pakistan is the third-largest recipient of U.S. aid after Egypt
and Israel, the beneficiary of a six-year, $4 billion package that
includes delivery of 50 F-16 jet fighters, the pride and backbone
of its air force.
   When the deal was signed in 1987, Western diplomats said, the
United States agreed to provide Pakistan with a sophisticated,
conventional defense force. The only hitch - Pakistan would not go
nuclear.
   ``That was the deal. They accepted it then,'' said one diplomat,
insisting on anonymity. ``But they are a sovereign state. They can
unaccept it now.''
   Sharif says he wants to maintain good relations with Washington,
but not at the cost of Pakistan's sovereignty and independence.
Pakistan, he says, is prepared to live with the consequences.
   But many Pakistanis say their country has become an addict of
foreign aid, receiving an estimated $3 billion annually, and has
been living beyond its means for a long time.
   The suspension of U.S. aid comes at a time when the Persian Gulf
crisis is taking its toll on Pakistan's economy, already burdened
by a $15.5 billion foreign debt. Oil prices have skyrocketed more
than 40 percent, remittances from the gulf have plummeted and
export earnings have dropped.
   Relations between the United States and Pakistan have followed
an on-again, off-again course since 1976, when Islamabad first
endured Washington's wrath by signing a nuclear reprocessing plant
deal with France. The project was canceled in 1977 and aid resumed
the following year.
   Washington again cut assistance in 1979 after disclosures that
Pakistan was importing sensitive materials to its nuclear facility
outside Islamabad.
   Aid was restarted later that year after the Soviet Union sent
its troops into neighboring Afghanistan and restored U.S.-Pakistan
relations to the cozy days of the 1950s containment of the
Communist threat.
   With the end to the Cold War and the Soviet withdrawal from
Afghanistan, Western diplomats say, Pakistan no longer has the
strategic importance it enjoyed during the Afghan war.
   After Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, many Pakistanis
believed the Persian Gulf would be their Afghanistan of the 1990s
and ease U.S. pressure. Instead, the gulf crisis has heightened the
pressure.
   ``An increasingly assertive Congress feels that the U.S.
administration ignored the wrong signals from Iraq to serve
short-term strategic goals and nurtured the fiend that devoured
Kuwait,'' said one military source, also insisting on anonymity.
   ``Fear of the `Islamic bomb' still looms large in the American
psyche,'' he said.

   Combat troops once at the front
line of the U.S. defense against the Soviets in Europe poured into
Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, the vanguard of the U.S. buildup in the
gulf.
   Sixteen hours after leaving snow-covered Germany, soldiers from
the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment were sweating in temperatures in
the high 70s and getting accustomed to walking in ankle-deep sand
at an air base in eastern Saudi Arabia.
   ``This is one of the best trained units in the Army,'' said Lt.
Andy Kilgore, 23, of Philadelphia, Miss., from the regiment's 2nd
Squadron. ``They've been trained to face 7-to-1 odds against the
Soviets. They're ready for the Iraqis or anybody else.''
   The arriving soldiers, some looking tense and nervous, said they
were well-trained for war, but hoping for peace.
   Lt. Gene Lanzillo, 25, of Alexandria, Va., said the unit used to
patrol the former East German border and had been ``on the cutting
edge'' of East-West divisions, never envisioning ending up in Saudi
Arabia.
   There was at least one similarity, he said. The Iraqis use
mainly Soviet equipment.
   ``I think they're a competent army, a battle-tested army after
eight years of fighting Iran. We're not leary of them but I think
we respect the power they represent,'' Lanzillo said.
   ``Certainly, we'd like it to be settled peacefully,'' he added.
``I think we have more to lose if it isn't.''
   The regiment is one of eight Army units ordered here as part of
the 200,000-strong troop buildup that will give the 240,000 U.S.
troops already in the gulf the capability to launch a military
operation to liberate Kuwait.
   Advance teams from other U.S. and German-based units have been
arriving here the past week, but the 2nd Armored Cavalry, which is
part of the Army's VII Corps, is the first major combat force to
reinforce Operation Desert Shield.
   Brig. Gen. Steven L. Arnold, assistant chief of staff of the
U.S. Armed Forces Central Command, said combat support units had
arrived first, unlike the initial U.S. deployment in early August
when combat troops were first on the ground.
   ``It's not the same situation that it was in August,'' he said
in an interview. ``In August, when the 82nd Airborne landed here,
they fully expected to fight that day.''
   With a lot of combat troops already here, the Army is now
returning to its normal practice of bringing in support teams first
so that when combat troops arrive there is already someone on the
ground to take care of their food, living quarters and
transportation, Arnold said.
   He said the main armored and mechanized units are now on their
way. ``We have some afloat coming from Europe, some moving from the
States and they'll be arriving soon,'' he said.
   All reinforcements are expected to be here by Jan. 15, the
deadline the United Nations has set for Saddam Hussein to withdraw
from Kuwait before facing possible military action by the
multinational force. It includes about 100,000 ground troops from
15 other countries.
   Some Air Force reinforcements also flew in on Wednesday.
   Several F-15 fighter pilots from the 1st Tactical Fighter Wing
at Langley Air Force Base, Va., landed at the airbase. A team of
civil engineers from Tyndall Air Force Base, Fla., who do rapid
runway repairs, were shuttling between two airbases because of a
mixup in their final destination. Several truck drivers from the
Air Force's 66th Transportation Company at Semback Air Force Base
in Germany didn't know where they were heading.
   Gen. Arnold said ``the ideal'' is to give newly arriving troops
at least three weeks to get used to the climate and the
environment, to make sure all their equipment has arrived and been
checked out, and to travel the several hundred miles to their
desert camps.

   Ford Motor Co. on Wednesday recalled
about 110,000 1990- and 1991-model Ford, Mercury and Lincoln cars
to see if they were equipped with potentially defective air bags.
   The company said TRW Vehicle Safety Systems Inc., an air bag
supplier, told it that about 3,000 potentially defective air bags
had been shipped to Ford assembly plants.
   Cars involved are 1990 models of the Ford Taurus and Tempo,
Mercury Sable and Topaz and Lincoln Continental along with 1990 and
1991 versions of the Ford Crown Victoria and Mercury Grand Marquis
cars.
   Owners will be notified by mail to return their cars to
dealerships for inspection.
   Originally, Ford recalled about 55,000 1990-91 model cars after
TRW said 133 air bags were potentially defective. TRW later raised
that number to about 3,000, Ford said.
   Also Wednesday, Ford recalled about 20,000 1988-90-model F-Super
Duty light trucks with 7.5-liter engines to install a new
electronic engine control processor.
   Some trucks experienced a loss of power due to the processor.
Replacement will be free.

<HEAD>Government Will Substitute Cheese for Peanut Butter in Food
Donations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A short crop has forced up the price of peanut
butter, so the Agriculture Department instead will donate more
cheese to schools and needy people, officials said Wednesday.
   Betty Jo Nelsen, administrator of the department's Food and
Nutrition Service, said process cheese prices have dropped to an
average of $1.20 per pound from about $1.65 a year ago.
   Meanwhile, drought-reduced peanut yields this year boosted
peanut butter prices to around $1.70 per pound from less than $1 a
year ago, she said.
   Cheese was in plentiful supply in the early 1980s as result of
large dairy surpluses, and was a big item on the USDA's food
donation list. But as these surpluses dwindled, prices rose and
little cheese was available for donations.
   ``Cheese is an excellent source of protein and calcium, and we
know our clients will be glad to see it back in our programs
again,'' Nelsen said.
   The cheese will be substituted for peanut butter on ``a limited
basis'' in the child nutrition programs, including school lunches,
and the program for the elderly, beginning in December, she said.
   In February, about 40 million pounds of cheese will replace
peanut butter in the Temporary Emergency Assistance Program, which
provides food aid to the needy, including low-income and unemployed
people, Nelsen said.

<TEXT>
   A former Panamanian lieutenant colonel prosecutors
say can tie Manuel Noriega directly to drug payoffs signed a
long-delayed plea bargain Wednesday, his attorney said.
   Luis del Cid agreed in March to plead guilty to some
drug-related charges, but the deal bogged down over guarantees he
would not be extradited to Panama for prosecution there after
serving his U.S. term.
   The Department of Justice has now agreed to oppose deporting or
extraditing del Cid, said his attorney, Sam Burstyn.
   ``Fortunately the U.S. government has agreed to all the points
now,'' Burstyn said.
   The agreement was signed late Wednesday and was to be the
subject of a hearing Thursday before U.S. District Judge William
Hoeveler.
   Burstyn said recent court battles over Noriega's taped telephone
conversations and the freezing of his assets boosted del Cid's
bargaining power.
   ``I figured we had reached a seller's market in light of the
government's recent difficulties,'' Burstyn said.
   Diane Cossin, spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office, said
she could not discuss negotiations with defendants' attorneys.
   Del Cid was a lieutenant colonel in the Panamanian military and
a top aide to Noriega when the two were captured during the U.S.
invasion.
   Del Cid ``acted as a liaison and money courier between drug
traffickers and Manuel Antonio Noriega,'' the U.S. attorney's
office has said.
   The plea agreement calls for del Cid to provide testimony
against Noriega, Burstyn said. Del Cid faced a maximum of 70 years
on four drug counts, but agreed to plead guilty to only one, with a
maximum recommended sentence of 10 years. Burstyn said he expected
del Cid to serve only about 2{ years.
   Noriega's defense professes iittle concern about del Cid's
possible testimony.
   ``He's just another witness who is getting paid for his
testimony,'' said Noriega attorney Jon May. ``Del Cid is just one
among many witnesses who are getting the keys to the jailhouse door
from a government that's desperate to shore up its case.''
   Del Cid's plea bargain will not hurt Noriega ``as long as del
Cid tells the truth,'' said a lead Noriega lawyer, Frank Rubino.
   Del Cid is accused in a February 1988 indictment of accepting
$200,000 in cocaine-trafficking profits from drug pilot Floyd
Carlton Caceres, now the prosecution's chief witness. Carlton and
Noriega had agreed to the price during a December 1983 meeting, the
indictment alleges.
   Later that month, Carlton delivered the money intended for
Noriega to del Cid at the headquarters of the Panamanian Defense
Forces in Panama City. The pilot continued to deal with Noriega and
prosecutors have said that shows the money was indeed passed on to
the Panamanian leader.
   The defense has previously disputed some prosecution claims that
del Cid was a key aide to Noriega, forcing the U.S. attorney's
office to acknowledge he was not head of Panamanian intelligence,
as they first claimed.
   But prosecutors in turn showed a picture of del Cid and Noriega
at a meeting with Cuban leader Fidel Castro, a meeting the
indictment says was intended to mediate a dispute between Noriega
and the Medellin drug cartel, which allegedly paid Noriega $4.6
million and bribes to ship cocaine through Panama.

Cause</HEAD>

investigative reports from Canada</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The United States embraced Canada's findings
about a 1985 air crash in Gander, Newfoundland, without consulting
the chief U.S. investigator who looked into the disaster, a
congressional panel was told Wednesday.
   George Seidlein, the National Transportation Safety Board's
chief on-site investigator in Gander, testified that Canadian
investigators were wrong in concluding that ice on the wings caused
the disaster that killed a planeload of American servicemen.
   Seidlein's superiors at the NTSB endorsed the ice-on-the-wings
theory, but didn't ask Seidlein for his opinion, even though they
sent him up to Gander to look into the crash which killed 256
Americans.
   Seidlein said the weather conditions simply weren't right for
ice to have formed on the wings in sufficient amounts to cause the
crash. He wasn't invited to give his views and didn't volunteer
them, he told the House Judiciary subcommittee on crime.
   Instead, he said, the crash occurred because the crew tried to
force the DC-8 to climb after takeoff before it had accelerated to
a high enough speed.
   Seidlein rejects the theory that a terrorist bomb might have
downed the plane, a possibility that has been raised by some
Canadian investigators, members of Congress and families of the
victims.
   Several eyewitnesses say they saw a bright flame just before the
crash. A terrorist group with ties to Iran claimed responsibility
for the disaster, which occurred amid the Reagan administration's
secret arms sales to Iran.
   Rep. William Hughes, D-N.J., asked Seidlein's boss, Ronald
Schleede, why the chief investigator wasn't questioned.
   Seidlein ``wasn't intentionally excluded'' from consultations,
replied Schleede, the NTSB's investigations chief.
   By the time Canada reached its conclusions, Seidlein had
transferred to an agency office in Lansing, Mich., and was about to
retire, Schleede testified.
   Hughes, the panel chairman, accused Schleede of ``trying to give
us a snow job.''
   ``Why did you send him up there'' to Gander?'' Hughes asked
Schleede. ``Is there a reason you didn't bring him in?''
   ``No sir,'' Schleede responded.
   Rep. William McCollum, R-Fla., suggested that the United States
was loathe to question Canada too closely about its probe of the
crash.
   Just because the two countries have close ties, that's no reason
``we ought to have blinders on,'' said McCollum.
   ``We had access to all the relevant data'' and found ``no
problems with'' the Canadians' findings, said Schleede, who still
regards the ice-on-the-wings theory as plausible.
   Seidlein said it was his choice to go to Lansing and that he was
under no pressure from the NTSB. But he also said he had been asked
for input on other international crashes before the U.S. decided
whether to endorse the findings.
   Hughes disclosed that the subcommittee has been pressing Canada
to provide investigative reports by the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police. The RCMP looked into the possibility of a terrorist link in
the Gander crash. Hughes said he will urge the 102nd Congress to
pursue the matter and that the FBI and intelligence agencies should
review the reports once the U.S. government obtains them.

   Washington tackle Jim Lachey said Wednesday
that his honor as the NFC offensive player of the week was really
an honor for the Redskins whole offensive line.
   ``One guy can't block for everybody,'' said Lachey, an all-pro
last year. ``This is an award for everybody.''
   Lachey this week became only the second blocker ever to win the
award as the week's top offensive performer. New York Giants tackle
Brad Benson was honored in December 1986 after a 24-14 victory over
the Redskins.
   Lachey was cited for leading a Redskins rushing attack that
piled up 222 yards on the ground Sunday against the Miami Dolphins,
who had been allowing an average of only 85 yards a game rushing.
   The Dolphins had been first in the AFC in rushing defense, but
Washington's Earnest Byner ran 32 times for 157 yards Sunday to
become the first back to clear 100 yards against them. The ground
game was key in the Redskins' 42-20 rout of Miami.
   ``It's a nice honor. I don't know what the criteria are, but
it's nice to have it. It means a lot as an honor to the total
offensive line,'' said Lachey.
   A sixth-year player, Lachey was obtained from the Los Angeles
Raiders in 1987 for quarterback Jay Schroeder, who now starts for
the Raiders. Redskins officials, however, consider the deal one of
their best in recent years and have long called Lachey the most
talented member of their line.
   ``I think it says a lot for him and the other linemen,'' coach
Joe Gibbs said of the award. ``I think it says a lot for our
coaches and linemen. They're a tight-knit group. They've bounced
back and taken some criticism.''
   Gibbs said coaches who grade game films said the Redskins'
blocking against Miami was their best of the season.
   Meanwhile, Gibbs brushed aside comments that were reportedly
made by former Redskin quarterback Joe Theismann critical of his
coaching methods and assistants.
   The National sports daily quoted Theismann Wednesday as saying
Gibbs had gotten rid of the team's ``characters'' and was becoming
so isolated that he was out of touch with his players.
   ``Joe hasn't been around much lately, so he needs to stop by. I
don't know where all that came from,'' Gibbs said.
   ``From the sounds of it I'm not sure Joe knows what he's talking
about,'' he said.
   The interview with Theismann, who was the Redskins quarterback
in their 1982 Super Bowl championship season, was included in the
newspaper's first edition to be sold in the Washington area.

<HEAD>Carr Withdraws Proposal to Limi Chairmen's Travel Authority</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN FLESHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Bob Carr suggested yanking the authority
of House chairmen to approve overseas junkets for their committees,
but that suggestion died before the day was over.
   ``I offered it only yesterday and didn't have the opportunity to
mount the campaign you need to make these kinds of things happen,''
he said Wednesday. ``I didn't want to embarrass anyone by springing
a surprise.''
   Carr, D-Mich., said he made his point just by floating his
proposed House rule, under which recorded committee votes would be
required for all committee-sponsored foreign travel. He withdrew
the proposal the same day he proposed it.
   House Democrats discussed the matter at length in a closed-door
caucus Tuesday, Carr said. And he said Rules Committee Chairman Joe
Moakley, D-Mass., and Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas, chairman of the
caucus panel on organization, promised to study possible changes in
travel policy.
   ``My intention at this point was to put people on notice, to
take a shot across the bow on congressional travel,'' Carr said.
``That may be enough to solve the problem. If there's a spate of
goofy, thinly-substantiated travel in the future, I'll press this
in a most forceful way.''
   Carr, elected last month to his ninth term, sought similar
reforms in the 1970s without success.
   He said he decided to renew his effort after seeing a television
news report on a trip to Latin America by eight members of the
House Ways and Means Committee last April. The group spent the last
five days of the 12-day excursion, which cost about $100,000, on
the Caribbean island of Barbados.
   An ABC News crew using hand-held cameras videotaped members of
the delegation there. The report, aired in October on the program
``PrimeTime Live,'' said the Barbados segment of the trip consisted
largely of leisure activities.
   Several lawmakers who made the trip said the presentation was
inaccurate and that they put in long hours of work. Carr said he
couldn't pass judgment on the entire Ways and Means trip, but that
the Barbados portion was ``suspect.''
   Publicity about such questionable activity threatens to
undermine public confidence in all congressional travel, most of
which is justified and can save money by giving lawmakers ideas for
changing programs, he said.
   Despite their power, committee chairmen can be overruled by a
majority of the members on most matters under House rules, Carr
said. But he said there is no provision limiting chairmen's power
to authorize travel.
   Under his proposed rule, all committee-sponsored foreign trips
would be authorized by a resolution approved by majority vote. The
resolution would include a detailed itinerary, the purpose for each
stop, the name of everyone making the trip, the estimated total
expense, and the trip's anticipated benefit to taxpayers.

<HEAD>House Chairman Accuses Justice Department of Coverup in Computer
Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee
accused the Justice Department on Wednesday of engaging in a
coverup by withholding documents about its dealings with a computer
firm.
   Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas, said the committee cannot complete
its investigation of the Justice Department's alleged mistreatment
of INSLAW, Inc., because the agency refuses to turn over some 200
documents it considers privileged.
   Brooks indicated the committee would conduct further discussions
to determine if it should subpoena the documents.
   Steven R. Ross, the general counsel for the House, charged that
in refusing to turn over the documents Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh was trying to exempt his department from congressional
investigations of waste, fraud and abuse.
   The Justice Department has been locked in a lengthy court battle
with INSLAW, Inc., a computer software firm that alleges that
government officials conspired to steal its product and drive it
out of business.
   The department is appealing a bankruptcy court's finding,
confirmed by a federal district judge, that officials used
``trickery, fraud and deceit'' to steal software that INSLAW had
devised for U.S. attorneys offices.
   The company's president, William Hamilton, estimated that the
Justice Department's actions cost INSLAW ``several hundred million
dollars'' in lost business.
   The Judiciary Committee is investigating INSLAW's allegations
that top Justice Department officials under former Attorney General
Edwin Meese III engaged in a criminal conspiracy to drive the
company out of business and deliver lucrative government computer
contracts to political friends of the Reagan administration. The
Justice Department denies those allegations.
   Brooks said the Justice Department's refusal to turn over 200
documents the agency considers privileged has stalled the
investigation.
   In a Sept. 26 letter to the committee, Thornburgh told the panel
he could not turn over the material because of an obligation to
``protect documents compiled by attorneys in connection with
pending litigation, which are not in the public domain and could be
described as `litigation strategy' or `work product.'''
   ``That could be described as coverup or hiding or holding out,''
Brooks said at a hearing of the panel's economic and commercial law
subcommittee to discuss what steps to take to force production of
the documents.
   Ross noted that in an Aug. 21 letter, Thornburgh urged the
committee to review Justice Department documents on the INSLAW
matter before launching an investigation into ``unsubstantiated
innuendo.''
   ``On the one hand, the attorney general invited the committee to
review the documents and then when the committee asks to see the
very same documents, he has switched positions and now is saying
those documents are privileged,'' Ross said.
   Ross said the Justice Department made a more direct attack on
Congress's power to investigate waste and fraud in the government
in a Dec. 4 letter to the panel's ranking Republican member, Rep.
Hamilton Fish of New York.
   The letter by W. Lee Rawls, assistant attorney general for
legislative affairs, states that ``congressional investigations are
justifiable only as a means of facilitating the task of passing
legislation.''
   Ross said the Justice Department is trying to ``create a new
standard for what is acceptable means of committee investigation.''
   ``What that proposed standard would do would be to eradicate the
time-honored role of Congress of providing oversight which is a
means that has been upheld by the Supreme Court ... by which the
Congress can assure itself that previously passed laws have been
properly implemented.''

   Scores of Jews and Arabs nearly came to blows
Wednesday in a raucous confrontation outside a courtroom where a
judge set $300,000 bail for the man charged with the murder of
Rabbi Meir Kahane.
   ``No bail for murderers!'' yelled the Jews, and the Arabs
shouted, ``God is great! Thanks be to God!'' as they met in a
hallway of the Manhattan Criminal Courts Building.
   Armed court officers wedged themselves between the groups and
forced the Arabs to leave the building by one set of elevators
while directing the Jews to another.
   Outside, both groups marched and chanted. The Jewish group
carried an effigy, intended to represent the suspect, with a noose
around the neck and a mock-up of an electric chair.
   The bail hearing was for El Sayyid Nosair, 35, of Cliffside,
N.J., who allegedly shot Kahane to death Nov. 5 as the rabbi
finished speaking to a Jewish group at a midtown Manhattan hotel.
   ``We will raise the bail as quickly as we can,'' said Nosair's
lawyer, Michael Warren. He was accompanied by an Egyptian lawyer,
Dr. Abdel Halim Mandour, who said he was here to help with the
case. Nosair came to this country from Egypt in 1981.
   Nosair is also accused of wounding two other men and threatening
a third while fleeing. He was stopped when a U.S. Postal Service
police officer shot him in the neck a block from the hotel.
   Warren asked a judge, Alvin Schlesinger, to set bail at
$100,000, saying Nosair had never been arrested before, has a wife
and child and other relatives here, and was a responsible city
employee. Nosair, a university-trained engineer, worked as a boiler
tender.
   Assistant District Attorney William Greenbaum opposed bail,
telling Schlesinger that the prosecution has witnesses, the murderweapon
and ballistics evidence to tie Nosair to the crimes.
   Greenbaum said Nosair did have an arrest record, a rape charge
in Pennsylvania in 1985 that was dropped.
   Schlesinger set bail and said he would issue his rulings on
motions March 4.
   During the hearing, a man who shouted ``God will punish you,
Nosair'' was ushered out of the courtroom and a woman who
complained that the bail was too low was restrained briefly by
court officers.

   An experimental anti-rejection drug has
reversed the effects of some auto-immune diseases and will be
tested on people suffering from the most serious form of diabetes,
a transplant surgeon said Wednesday.
   The Food and Drug Administration approved a University of
Pittsburgh study in which the Type I diabetes patients will be
given the drug, FK-506, about a week after diagnoses, Dr. Thomas
Starzl said.
   ``We are anxious to get the information out that there is
something that could switch off this disease,'' Starzl told
reporters. ``Whether you believe it's proper or not, it's only here
that teens or adults can be treated - providing we can see them
early.''
   Several Type I diabetes studies are under way on weaker
immune-suppressing drugs, but FK-506 has shown the most potential
for curbing the illness, said Gerod Grodsky, a biochemistry
professor and diabetes researcher at the University of San
Francisco.
   ``I think this is an experiment that has to be done,'' Grodsky
said. ``The potential advantages are enormous.''
   Type I diabetes, also known as juvenile diabetes, affects 11 to
12 million Americans of all ages. It can cause blindness and kidney
failure, and its symptoms are excessive thirst, frequent urination,
rapid weight loss and blurred vision.
   Only University of Pittsburgh hospitals have been given FDA
approval to use FK-506, which Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co. of Japan
derives from a fungus. The drug fights rejection of organ
transplants by suppressing white blood cells, which stave off
infection and disease.
   The university already has tested the drug on two auto-immune
diseases. In such diseases, the body's white cells mistakenly
destroy healthy cells.
   FK-506 reversed the effects of psoriasis, a skin disease that
creates unsightly skin lesions, in all six patients who took the
drug, Starzl said. The drug also reversed the effects of pyoderma,
a rare skin ulcer, in six of seven patients, he said.
   ``We're seeing some very dramatic recoveries,'' he said.
   Also, FK-506 appeared to cure a disease similar to Type I
diabetes in laboratory rats, said Dr. Patricia Carroll of
Pittburgh's medical school.
   Starzl said researchers hope to test FK-506 on ``a dizzying list
of diseases,'' including multiple sclerosis and a form of
hepatitis.
   Starzl, who in 1963 performed the world's first successful human
liver transplant, is credited with making the university a world
transplant center.
   At the news conference, Starzl, 64, also said he would perform
fewer surgeries and more research at the university's planned
transplant institute.
   The university has started a nationwide search for 60 Type I
diabetes patients ages 18 to 45 for the two-year study. Half will
receive insulin and FK-506, half will receive insulin and placebos,
Carroll said.
   Patients with Type I diabetes need insulin shots to survive
because the white cells destroy the body's insulin factories in the
pancreas.
   Complicating the study is the Type I diabetes' so-called
``honeymoon period,'' up to a year of remission after diagnosis in
about half the patients, Carroll said. It will be difficult to
determine if improvements in patients' conditions are due to the
remissions or the drug, she said.
   Grodsky said he was concerned about FK-506's side effects on the
diabetes patients. But Carroll said researchers have yet to see the
drug's side effects in patients who haven't undergone transplants.
   In transplant patients, FK-506 has caused dizziness and
excessive dreaming, she said.
   While the Type I study ``is very exciting, whether this drug is
the one that works or not, we don't know yet,'' Grodsky said.

   A former state legislator received three
years probation and a $2,500 fine Wednesday on a cocaine possession
charge stemming from an FBI investigation of Statehouse corruption.
   ``I feel there is nothing more I can say except that I am
terribly sorry,'' the former House member, Donna Moss, told U.S.
District Judge Falcon Hawkins.
   Mrs. Moss, a Gaffney Democrat and the mother of two, is the
third former lawmaker sentenced in the probe.
   Under sentencing guidelines, Mrs. Moss could have received up to
four months in jail. She pleaded guilty Oct. 12 to the single
misdemeanor count. As part of a plea bargain, she agreed to
cooperate with the government.
   Mrs. Moss admitted involvement with drugs on or about April 19,
1989.
   Her attorney, Wade Weatherford, told Hawkins ``Mrs. Moss became
associated with people she thought were her friends.''
   Weatherford, arguing his client should not go to jail, said
after she broke company with those people she never used drugs
again.
   ``She has readily admitted her guilt and cooperated fully,''
Weatherford said. ``She has never received financial gain for
anything she has done.''
   He said it ``is impossible to express her feelings of having
hurt people. She has lost a promising political career but that is
probably the least of her loss and hurt.''
   Mrs. Moss needs to be home for her two children, ages 10 and 15,
Weatherford said.
   Hawkins said he was confident Mrs. Moss has suffered for ``the
pain and suffering'' brought on her family and ``the humiliation
you have brought on your fellow-members of the legislature.''
   As terms of probation, Mrs. Moss must, if asked, submit to
random drug testing. She must cooperate with authorities and pay
$96.66 a month for probation costs. In addition, she must pay a $25
special assessment.
   U.S. Attorney Bart Daniel said Mrs. Moss began cooperating with
authorities ``literally within hours'' of being contacted by the
FBI.
   The extent of the cooperation was briefly discussed during a
hearing at the judge's bench. The record of the hearing was ordered
sealed by Hawkins.
   Monday, former state Sen. Rick Lee got six months at a halfway
house and five years' probation. Former Rep. Luther Taylor got a
6{-year prison term.
   Lee, R-Boiling Springs, had pleaded guilty to taking cash for
supporting a bill allowing betting on horse and dog racing in South
Carolina.
   Taylor contested the government's bribery case. A federal jury
in October convicted him on six counts of violating federal bribery
laws.
   Authorities say Mrs. Moss was not connected with vote-buying
activities, but information uncovered during the FBI's ``Operation
Lost Trust'' led to the drug charge.
   Three former House members who pleaded guilty to bribery charges
await sentencing. Four other House members await trial.
   Mrs. Moss was elected to the House in 1984 and rose to head of
the Medical, Military, Public and Municipal Affairs Committee. She
resigned her seat on Sept. 21, the day of her indictment.

<TEXT>
   U.S. and Philippine panels began
talks Wednesday on the future of U.S. military bases in the
Philippines, and a U.S. spokesman said later both sides expected to
reach agreement by next month.
   The Americans maintain the giant Clark Air Base, Subic Bay Naval
Base and four smaller facilities under a treaty that expires in
September 1991.
   Stanley Schrager, spokesman for the U.S. side, told a briefing
after Wednesday's meeting that both panels are optimistic they can
agree by the end of January, their self-imposed deadline.
   On Tuesday, before talks began, the Philippines spokesma  said
disagreements had surfaced on operation of the bases.
   Schrager said Wednesday, ``Obviously, the talks have not broken
down. There has not been an impasse.''
   Philippine spokesman Rafael Alunan said technical committees of
the two negotating teams had ``difficulties'' agreeing how much
freedom will be allowed U.S. forces inside Clark after the
Philippines assumes ``sovereign control'' over the base.
   Alunan said Wednesday's talks provided a ``clearer
understanding'' of each other's position but no agreements were
reached. Talks will resume Thursday.
   Schrager said any disagreements by the experts will have to be
resolved later by Philippine Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus and
chief U.S. negotiator Richard Armitage.
   ``Our hope is by the time Mr. Armitage leaves on Friday, we
would come closer to resolving some of the stickier issues ... and
mapping out an initial framework for a continued security
relationship,'' Schrager said.
   The third round of bases talks opened in the heavily guarded
Central Bank building. Manglapus and Armitage met privately
Tuesday.
   Manglapus has announced the Philippines will take over Clark and
the four small bases after 1991, but allow U.S. forces access on a
commercial basis. He said Manila was open to extending the U.S.
stay at Subic for a 5-to-7-year period.
   Americans would have access to ``standing structures'' at Clark,
but the Philippines will control thoroughfares, runways and air
traffic control, Alunan said.
   He said Filipino officials encountered ``stiff resistance'' from
the American side when they insisted on applying Philippine laws on
tariffs, income taxes, duties, licenses and registration inside
Clark.
   An official close to the talks, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the Philippines demanded total criminal
jurisdiction over U.S. service members, takeover of postal service
and use of the Philippine peso as currency in the base.
   ``A lot of this is totally unacceptable (to the Americans),''
the official said. ``This has to be straightened out at a higher
level.''
   Exact amount of compensation for U.S. use of the bases will be
determined later.
   In 1988, the Reagan administration agreed to seek $960 million
in U.S. aid over two years for use of the bases through 1991.
   Last year, Congress cut the Bush administration's aid request
for the Philippines, provoking charges that the United States
reneged on its pledge.

<TEXT>
   Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic
on Wednesday urged Yugoslavs to learn from their history and avoid
fratricidal violence ahead of elections pitting his Socialist Party
against nationalist parties.
   ``There is no time or reason to give our lives again'' in the
struggle over the country's fate, said Milosevic, whose party of
hard-line Communists recently changed its name to the Socialist
Party.
   The state Tanjug news agency reporting his comments said he
spoke to about 70,000 supporters in Novi Sad, 40 miles northwest of
Belgrade.
   Serbia, the largest of six Yugoslav republics, and Montenegro
are the last of Yugoslavia's six republics to be ruled by
Communists, giving Sunday's elections special significance.
   With ethnic and political tensions rife, the Central
Intelligence Agency has predicted the country may break up in 18
months and civil war could break out.
   Many of the 1.7 million victims of World War II were Yugoslavs
killed by other Yugoslavs, and with the death of Communist founder
Josip Broz Tito in 1980, traditional regional rivalries have
rekindled.
   Serbia's differences with ethnic Albanians in its province of
Kosovo have resulted in bloodshed several times the past year.
Serbia also is feuding with Croatia and Slovenia, the most liberal
Yugoslav republics, over the future of the country.
   Milosevic would prefer a strong federation where Serbia can
maintain its dominance. But Croatia's and Slovenia's newly
established democratic governments have served notice they could
seek independence unless the country was changed into a loose
confederation with greater autonomy.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Author Salman Rushdie emerged from two years of
hiding Wednesday to sign some books in a north London bookshop.
   The Indian-born Bitish writer was sentenced to death two years
ago by the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini for allegedly blaspheming
Islam in his book, ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Rushdie was accompanied by bodyguards, but looked relaxed as he
signed 100 copies of his new book, ``Haroun and the Sea of
Stories.'' The children's fantasy written during his time in hiding
is dedicated to his son, Zafar.
   ``He was wonderful, he was relaxed and chatted with the
customers and was glad to sign for them. There were a lot of
customers doing double-takes when they came into the shop and saw
him,'' said David McRedmond, manager of Waterstone's Books in the
wealthy north London neighborhood of Hampstead.
   ``We were only given brief notice that he was coming and were a
bit surprised he was coming out at all,'' McRedmond said, adding
that many customers wished Rushdie well during the 20-minute
signing.
   ``One woman said, `It's very nice to see you out and about
enjoying some fresh air', which he was very touched by,'' said a
spokeswoman for Rushdie's publisher, Viking.
   Rushdie has appeared on British Television twice in the last few
months. In September, he was filmed at a secret ``safe'' house for
a special. Last month, he recorded an interview at a British
Broadcasting Corp. studio.

   The Keating Five senators pressured thrift
regulators on behalf of ``probably the worst institution in
America,'' and caused enforcement delays that inflated the cost of
the eventual federal bailout, the Senate Ethics Committee was told
Wednesday.
   William K. Black's criticism was the strongest the committee has
heard of the senators' intervention with thrift regulators. Black,
a senior career regulator, was the first witness in 12 days of
hearings to blame the senators for delays in the government's
seizing of Charles H. Keating Jr.'s Lincoln Savings and Loan.
   At the conclusion of Wednesday's session, Committee Chairman
Howell Heflin, D-Ala., announced the panel has voted to compel the
testimony of a key aide to Keating, James Grogan.
   The regulator's testimony had defense lawyers for the senators
bitterly objecting that Black should not be permitted to blame the
delay on senators because he had no direct knowledge they were
responsible. He was permitted to give the testimony.
   Black said political pressure by all the senators generally
played a role in delaying the seizure from 1987 to April 1989. It
may now cost taxpayers more than $2 billion to cover the losses of
the Irvine, Calif., thrift.
   The regulator specifically linked pressure from an aide to Sen.
Alan Cranston, D-Calif., in May 1988 to delaying decisions by
regulators that ``greatly increased losses'' for taxpayers.
   At an April 9, 1987 meeting between the five senators and four
regulators, including himself, Black testified that Sen. Dennis
DeConcini, D-Ariz., ``kept coming at us'' on Lincoln's behalf even
after the regulators said they were making criminal referrals to
the Justice Department.
   Cranston's lawyer, William Taylor III, called Black's testimony
``the most fundamental smear.'' James Hamilton, representing
DeConcini, said Black was ``having people smeared, having innuendo
left'' and was ``reckless and irresponsible.''
   The other three senators under investigation are John McCain,
R-Ariz.; Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., and John Glenn, D-Ohio.
Keating and his associates contributed $1.3 million to the five
senators' campaigns and causes; the committee is trying to
determine whether the money influenced their conduct.
   Earlier, two former chief thrift regulators, Edwin J. Gray and
M. Danny Wall, told the committee the senators were not responsible
for delaying the seizure of Keating's Irvine, Calif., thrift until
April 14, 1989.
   That was two years after the San Francisco-based regulators who
met with the senators in 1987 had recommended a government
takeover.
   Black provided a vivid account of the April 9, 1987 meeting with
the senators, saying he was extremely upset with their hostile tone
toward the regulators.
   ``This is an institution that probably was the worst institution
in America, and instead of people trying to help bring it under
control, five U.S. senators were pushing us in the opposite
direction. It was startlingly the wrong direction,'' Black
testified.
   ``They had made a decision we were wrong, Lincoln was an abused
institution and they were coming after us. We were put under
considerable pressure immediately. You could see it in our faces.
   ``Five U.S. senators are a heck of a lot bigger than this boy. I
felt Charles Keating had clearly set up'' the session ``to be
intimidating.''
   Black also said he became aware that Keating was trying to have
him fired. Committee counsel Robert Bennett released a July 15,
1987 memo from Keating to his lobbyist in which Keating wrote:
   ``Highest priority - get Black. Good grief - If you can't get
Wright and Congress to get Black - kill him dead - you ought to
retire.''
   Wright is a reference to former House Speaker Jim Wright, who
met on at least one occasion with Keating.
   But the testimony that most riled defense lawyers came when
Bennett asked Black:
   ``In the two-year period where the bank board did not take
action, did the inquiry by the senators have an effect on board
decisions?''
   ``Yes,'' Black responded, and repeated the answer when the
committee chairman, Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., asked whether
``political influence of these senators interfered with or affected
the treatment of Lincoln.''
   Black testified the Federal Home Loan Bank Board backed off its
tough position on Lincoln in May 1988.
   He testified that after the board approved a hard-line policy on
May 5 of that year, a Cranston aide, Carolyn Jordan, ``called two
senior officers at the bank board ... and indicated severe
displeasure.''
   The board revised its policy, Black said, to ``expressly permit
Lincoln to make new direct investments they would not otherwise be
allowed to make.''
   Lincoln also was permitted to significantly expand its sale of
junk bonds.
   ``This led to greatly increased losses for the (federal savings
and loan) insurance fund initially and the taxpayers eventually,''
Black said.
   Under cross-examination from McCain attorney John Dowd, Black
was asked whether the Arizona Republican had done ``anything to
interfere with your examination of Lincoln.''
   ``Not to my knowledge,'' Black replied.
   And under questioning from Glenn lawyer Carol E. Bruce, Black
acknowledged that the senator ``could not have known'' before
meeting with regulators ``how bad the problems were.''
   Heflin said the committee on Thursday would seek an order in
U.S. District Court granting limited immunity from prosecution for
Grogan's testimony. Grogan was corporate counsel for Keating's main
company, American Continental Corp., and vice president of Lincoln.
   Grogan, Keating and five other witnesses have refused to testify
on the grounds that the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution permits
them to decline to testify in a manner that might incriminate them.
   Heflin said no immunity order would be sought for Keating.
   In explaining the decision, Heflin said Grogran ``had
substantial contacts'' with all five senators and ``the committee
believes it cannot fulfill its obligation to these members and the
Senate without obtaining his testimony.''
   The chairman added that ``giving use immunity to Mr. Grogan does
not bar the prosecution of any person, including Mr. Grogan.''
Under a grant of ``use immunity,'' prosecutors may not use
testimony of the witness in question in any way, but are not barred
from a prosecutionif they can show their evidence was obtained
independently.
   No date for Grogan's appearance has been set but Heflin said he
would not testify before Dec. 12.

<HEAD>Miami Police Chief Defends Disturbance Response</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BETH DUFF-BROWN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Miami's police chief, who has weathered more than
20 riots during 22 years on the force, said Wednesday that
criticism over slow police reaction to a melee this week is
overblown and unwarranted.
   Police had no idea violence would escalate in a largely Puerto
Rican neighborhood and they had to stay on side streets until
reinforcements arrived, said Perry Anderson, who has headed the
department of 1,114 officers for 2{ years.
   Anderson said the Monday incident, in which hundreds of youths
swarmed through the city's impoverished Wynwood neighborhood
looting stores and setting fires, was minor compared to what he's
been through in the past.
   ``This was not a riot. This was not even an uprising,'' the
46-year-old Anderson said in an interview. ``Everybody's crying
foul. You see it all over (the news) and it looks like Miami's
burning down. But Miami's not on fire. You have to look at the
magnitude of what actually happened here.''
   Two large businesses, a vacant crack house and four vehicles
were destroyed by fire, causing an estimated $3 million damage. A
dozen small businesses were hit by looters. Anderson said there
have been 11 arrests stemming from the disturbance so far.
   ``We're not being given credit that we did not lose any lives,''
said Anderson, who recalled a 1980 riot that left 18 people dead
after an all-white jury acquitted five police officers in the
beating death of a black motorcyclist.
   Monday's incident was sparked by the partial acquittal of six
officers accused of beating to death a small-time Puerto Rican drug
dealer from the neighborhood.
   The unrest began about 7 p.m and raged unchecked until 150
officers in full riot gear moved in about 9:30 p.m.
   Until police could get back up help, they did the best they
could to keep people from entering the 10-block area, Anderson
said. The police also kept close guard on surrounding districts,
where thousands of employees work in the city's garment industry.
   But that didn't make business and community leaders feel better
in Wynwood, considered one of the poorest neighborhoods in Miami
with an annual median income of $10,900.
   ``The worst thing was that the cops were there ... and they
didn't do anything,'' said Manny Frias, whose television store was
cleaned out by looters.
   ``It was just the most helpless thing I've experienced in my
life,'' said Sara Seidler, whose drapery store burned to the
ground. ``Why didn't the police go in? How come there were media in
here and there were no police?''
   Patrick Gerrits, whose 44-year-old construction company was
gutted, said he got calls from officers as early as 4 p.m. warning
him to clear out.
   Anderson said he is infuriated that officers made such calls to
businesses but didn't notify their superiors of a possible
disturbance.
   ``None of those people informed the chief of police,'' he said.
   Critics say the police should not have been caught off guard, as
Anderson and Mayor Xavier Suarez have admitted, given the city's
penchant for unrest after a racially charged trial involving
police.
   Anderson, who said he was criticized this summer for moving in
too quickly during a Haitian demonstration, complained, ``Now I'm
being criticized because I didn't go in early enough. You're damned
if you do, damned if you don't.''

   President Bush offered some
painfully learned advice to Argentine President Carlos Menem: watch
out for boom microphones.
   Bush suggested the warning Wednesday as he posed for pictures
with Menem in his private office at Casa Rosada, the president's
palace. Reporters, cameramen and photographers crowded into the
room, and someone extended a long-poled boom microphone in the
presidents' direction.
   ``I got myself in trouble with an open mike,'' Bush said,
motioning at the offending instrument and mentioning an
embarrassing incident during his 1984 vice presidential campaign
against Geraldine Ferraro.
   Bush was referring to his comments to longshoremen on the
morning after his one debate with Mrs. Ferraro. He was speaking
just to the group, but a highly sensitive mike over his head picked
what he said. ``We tried to kick a little ass last night,'' Bush
said then. The comments haunted him for the remainder of the
campaign.
   If there was any further discussion of the incident between Bush
and Menem, it went unrecorded - even on the boom mikes.
   ---&equals;
   Bush's annual quail-hunting trip in Beeville, Texas, after
Christmas has fallen victim to the Persian Gulf crisis.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the president
would spend the holidays at Camp David, instead. ``With everything
that's going on, he just thought that was best,'' Fitzwater said.
   Usually, Bush and his wife, Barbara, spend Christmas at Camp
David, and then the president heads out two days later for several
days of hunting at Beeville followed by a trout fishing excursion
in Alabama on the way home.
   ----&equals;
   Words were shouted in anger and pushes and shoves were traded as
a leftist legislator demanded the right to speak as Bush waited to
address a joint session of Argentina's Congress.
   Luis Zamora, a member of the Movement Toward Socialism, sought
recognition so he could protest Bush's visit. However, Vice
President Eduardo Dualde quickly advised Zamora that he was out of
order and could not be heard. Amid some scuffling, Zamora was
removed from the room by several colleagues and a sergeant at arms.
   ``I don't want to be part of this farce,'' Zamora said
afterwards. A cameraman said the incident escalated outside the
chamber, and that the pushing turned into an exchange of blows.
   Bush took it in stride.
   ``Lest you be embarrassed by the echo we heard at the opening of
this ceremony, don't worry about it,'' the president told the
lawmakers. ``Every once in a while you hear an echo from the
declining past of Marxism.'' He said it was the price for
democracy.
   ----&equals;
   With his wife ailing at home from a sinus infection, Bush
brought his daughter Dorothy LeBlond to South America as his
companion. She also was his tennis partner.
   They teamed up for a doubles match at Menem's house against the
Argentine president and Claudia Casa Bianca, a former Argentine
tennis pro. Then, Menem and Bush teamed up against Alberto Kohan,
his health minister, and Jorge Dante, Menem's tennis instructor.
After trailing, Bush and Menem rallied to win 5-4.
   It was the second contest for Bush and Menem. The two also had
played together last year in Costa Rica amid ceremonies celebrating
that country's 100th anniversary of democratic rule.
   ---&equals;
   Sports stars from the fields of tennis, basketball, track and
golf were tapped by Bush on Wednesday to be members of the
President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports.
   Named to the advisory panel were retired tennis professional
Chris Evert, Los Angeles Lakers guard ``Magic'' Johnson, track star
Jackie Joyner-Kersee and professional golfer Chi Chi Rodriguez.
Bush also tapped Sammy Lee, a diving coach from Huntington Beach,
Calif., and James Lorimer, an insurance executive from Columbus,
Ohio.

   Northwest Airlines pilot Bill Lovelace had just
begun to get his life in order after a divorce and business failure
when he found himself on the wrong runway at Detroit's foggy Metro
Airport.
   The pilot in a runway crash that killed eight people was
described by friends Wednesday as a professional-caliber magician
and woodworker, a man meticulous in everything he did.
   ``I would never hesitate to fly with him,'' said Barbara
Giannini, a neigbor.
   Investigators say Lovelace was piloting a Northwest DC-9 that
collided with one of the carrier's Boeing 727s on Monday killing
eight people on the DC-9 and injuring 24 others. No one aboard the
727 was injured.
   Lovelace, 52, whose own injuries were minor, once was an
instructor in flying DC-9s and has flown commercial airliners since
1966, Northwest officials said.
   After logging 20,000 hours in commercial flight, he took
disability leave in February 1985 for kidney stone treatment.
   Monday's flight would have been his 13th since returning to work
Nov. 25 following two weeks of ground training and 13 hours of
simulator flying. Five of the dozen flights had been into or out of
the Detroit airport, but Monday's was his first without a monitor
at his side, Northwest said.
   Three weeks before returning to active duty, Lovelace had been
declared bankrupt under a petition he had filed in mid-July in
federal Bankruptcy Court in Phoenix. Court records show he cited
debts of about $152,000 against assets of $106,000 and a monthly
income of $4,212 in pension and retirement benefits.
   The airline has described his absence as a medical leave rather
than retirement.
   His bankruptcy laywer, David Engelman, said part ofLovelace's
debt stemmed from an unsuccessful gift shop that he sold in 1989.
   Divorced and with two grown children, Lovelace had remarried in
September. He was certified as fit to fly Oct. 10 by the Federal
Aviation Administration.
   ``Flying was his No. 1 love; he talked about it often,'' said
Judy Wells, a friend of 3{ years.
   No one answered the door at Lovelace's Phoenix residence
Wednesday, where a neatly trimmed kumquat tree graces the front
yard of the beige, stucco one-story house with heavy, brown
shutters.
   Neighbors offered a positive portrait of the man.
   An accomplished magician, he performed as the Great Orsini,
complete with swirling black cape.
   ``Good enough to be professional,'' said a friend, Jack Wall.
   ``He's just a good neighbor,'' said Ms. Judy Wells, who took
over the gift shop he'd started during his medical leave. ``He'd
stop in and see how your day was going.''
   Neighbor Dave Giannini, a carpenter, also knows him as ``very
fussy, meticulous, very intelligent.''
   ``His house, shop - anything he did - had to be just right,''
said Giannini, who lives across the street from Lovelace.
   ``I don't honestly believe it was his negligence'' that led to
the collision, Giannini said. ``That guy was a straight guy. ...
Even driving a vehicle he was really cautious.''
   Brad Zinn, a friend who patronizes Sun Magic Shop where Great
Orsini posters are displayed, said Lovelace is ``a very detailed
kind of guy.''
   ``Everything was just so with Bill, and I'm sure he took that
into the cockpit,'' Zinn said. ``Bill just wouldn't have wandered
onto the runway without some good reason. There must have been some
miscommunication.''
   It was Lovelace's interest in magic that led to his woodworking.
   He would perform shows for schools and hospitals when he wasn't
flying. And because he needed props for such tricks as sawing a
woman in half, he said in a 1986 newspaper interview, he decided to
make his own.
   That led to purchase of a table saw and other equipment, and
ultimately to the lathe on which he shapes bowls that have sold for
$300 to $750. He once said it took 40 to 50 hours to make one of
them.
   He also has produced chess sets and grandfather clocks.

<HEAD>Nurses Say Brain-Damaged Woman Happier With Lover</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A woman who was severely brain-damaged in a
1983 traffic accident appears far happier with her lesbian lover
than with anyone else, several nurses testified Wednesday during a
guardianship hearing.
   The hearing to determine the guardianship of Sharon Kowalski
once pitted her parents against her lover, but Don and Della
Kowalski say they no longer have the energy or the money to care
for their disabled daughter.
   That leaves only Ms. Kowalski's lover, Karen Thompson, seeking
guardianship.
   Kowalski relinquished guardianship of his daughter last year and
she has been cared for since at a nursing home in suburban
Robbinsdakem, pending Ms. Thompson's petition.
   Maryanne Connell, a licensed practical nurse from Trevilla
Nursing Home, testfied that Ms. Thompson has been extremely
concerned about Ms. Kowalski's emotional and physical welfare.
   ``When Karen Thompson isn't around, she is withdrawn. She'll be
real quiet,'' Ms. Connell said. ``When Karen is there, she's always
smiling. She responds better. She cooperates.''
   Other nurses provided similar testimony, which was scheduled to
continue through Friday, when Judge Robert Campbell could make a
final ruling.
   Gay rights activists have rallied around Ms. Thompson, saying
she is the most capable of caring for Ms. Kowalski, 33, who was
paralyzed in an accident blamed on a drunken driver.
   Ms. Kowalski lost use of her limbs and can't speak, but she can
use the fingers on her right hand and communicates by typing,
shaking her head and using an alphabet board. She taught physical
education before the accident.
   Ms. Thompson, a professor at St. Cloud State University, has
testified that she and Ms. Kowalski lived together four years
before the accident and considered themselves secretly married.
   Kowalski had earlier fought Ms. Thompson's attempts to gain
guardianship, saying he thought she only wanted to make money on
speeches and a book about his daughter. Neither he nor his wife
attended Wednesday's hearing.

   These are tough times for local and state officials. Confronted
by falling revenues and widening budget gaps they are laying off
workers, trimming aid to the old and poor and limiting services
from garbage collection to snowplowing.
   ``It takes a lot of courage to be a local elected officials
these days,'' said Douglas Peterson, senior policy analyst for the
National League of Cities. ``They're going to be making harder and
harder choices.''
   At least 26 states face deficits or budget shortfalls this
fiscal year; several others will next year. The prospects get worse
as the economy continues to slide.
   Local officials are even harder pressed. Federal funds from
earlier years have dried up and many states have cut local aid to
balance their budgets.
   ``We're at the bone already and the marrow is just beginning to
leak,'' said Dave Fuller, a commissioner in Lewis and Clark County,
Mont., where any more bad fiscal news will mean cuts in senior
citizen programs, snowplowing and road repair.
   There are a few exceptions. Oil states such as Alaska and
Louisiana see revenues grow along with oil prices. Wyoming is
anticipating an unexpected $184 million in increased revenues next
year.
   But the bounty is double-edged. Before his term as governor
expired this week, Alaska's Steve Cowper asked for $4.3 million
more to pay escalating costs for fueling state cars, trucks and
ferries.
   Elsewhere, officials struggle to maintain the status quo as the
situation grows more bleak.
   ``We're kind of like a boat in a swift-flowing stream and I am
trying to keep that boat right where it is, instead of being swept
downstream in that current,'' said Gov.-elect Zell Miller of
Georgia, where dropping revenues threaten layoffs next year.
   In most cases spending is being trimmed through across-the-board
spending cuts.
   ``It allows department heads to decide what their priorities
are,'' said said Marsha Howard, research director for the National
Association of State Budget Directors. ``The problem with
across-the-board cuts is that you might end up with a small agency
taking such a cut that it can't exist anymore.''
   However cuts are imposed, they mean a reduction in what
government can do.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo's proposed $1 billion spending cut
would reduce state aid to education, Medicaid, the homeless and
those with AIDS.
   ``If you don't like these cuts, then show me what other cuts you
have in mind,'' Cuomo said, when his plan was met with criticism.
``I frankly don't believe there are a whole lot of other
alternatives.''
   Massachusetts has laid off 1,711 workers, leaving fewer social
workers for abused children. Virginia has laid off 700 state
employees, including college faculty and staff. Gov. L. Douglas
Wilder has ordered a mental hospital closed.
   Los Angeles and Louisville, Ky., have closed health centers.
Vermont and Maryland put off programs to pay prescription for the
elderly. Delaware postponed a program to fight drug and alcohol
abuse among pregnant women.
   Education also has suffered. State college tuitions are rising
in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Virginia and New
Jersey. New York City faces teacher layoffs. Lower per-pupil
funding will mean fewer new teachers and larger classroom
populations in Kansas.
   Snow removal is being cut. Concord, N.H., won't bring out the
plows until it snows 4 inches. So far, the state capitol has been
spared a snowstorm.
   ``We're kind of operating on a wing and a prayer at this
point,'' said Assistant City Manager Julia Griffin.
   Many places have put off repairs on sewer systems, roads and
bridges.
   ``There might be a road not paved or plowed or a water or sewer
system not upgraded,'' said Lash Chaffin of the League of Nebraska
Municipalities. ``Those are the kinds of things that come back to
haunt you in future years, but they are things the public doesn't
see.''
   Other cuts are highly visible. A $20 million deficit has forced
Los Angeles to impose a seven-month hiring freeze on the police
department at a time when the homicide rate approaches a record.
   The budget ax has fallen on rich and poor communities.
Washington, D.C. Mayor-elect Sharon Pratt Dixon promises to cut
2,000 workers in the face of a $100 million revenue shortfall.
Officials in Washington's affluent suburbs of Montgomery County,
Md., and Fairfax County, Va., say they will be forced to make sharp
cuts.
   Some communities are still looking to taxes to avoid painful
cuts. The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors is studying
increased taxes on utilities and hotel rooms. New York City is
contemplating a similar move on hotel bills.
   But many have been to the tax trough only to see deficits
continue to grow. Arizona faces a $108 million deficit despite a
$250 million tax increase last spring. New Jersey, with more than
$2.8 billion in new taxes, faces a $600 million deficit. New York
has raised taxes $3 billion over the last two years.
   A survey this spring of National League of Cities' 15,000
members found 76 percent had already increased charges for services
like garbage collection. Forty percent had raised property taxes.
   Yet officials still strive to find places to cut.
   In Dutchess County, N.Y., which faces the elimination of 75
jobs, County Executive Lucille Pattison found the clerk's office
was paying $1,000 a year for canned music.
   ``You can get rid of people but you can keep Muzak? Come on,''
County Budget Director David Squires said.

<HEAD>Gunshots Wound Three on Bus, Signaling Possibly New Arab Tactic</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Gunshots were fired at an Israeli bus and car
Wednesday in the occupied West Bank, wounding three Jewish settlers
in an attack that may signal rising Arab militancy, government and
news reports said.
   Palestinians protesters have generally thrown stones and
firebombs at Israeli vehicles, avoiding guns. But Israel television
said Wednesday's attack augurs an increasingly militant mood among
Palestinians.
   Leaflets distributed this week by the uprising leaders, who
support the Palestine Liberation Organization, urged Palestinians
to attack Israelis ``using all means of struggle available.''
   Military sources said several shots were fired at the bus of
Egged, the national bus company, as it drove on a main thoroughfare
near Jelazoun refugee camp, north of Ramallah in the West Bank.
   Six to 10 bullets were fired at the bus, smashing some windows
and wounding the three settlers, the government news agency Itim
said. Soldiers reportedly launched wide searches suspects.
   The bus was headed to Elon Moreh, Israeli reports said. The
settlement is near Nablus and known for its Jewish militancy.
   The three wounded bus passengers, a married couple and another
woman, all from Elon Moreh, were rushed by ambulance to Hadassah
Hospital in Jerusalem, hospital spokeswoman Ruth Mekel said. Mekel
said all three were slightly wounded.
   Israel radio said shots were also fired at an Israeli-owned
automobile traveling behind the bus, apparently from a mosque, but
that no one in the car was injured.
   The worst bus attack of the Arab uprising was in July 1989, when
16 Israelis and foreigners were killed. A Palestinian grabbed the
steering wheel of a bus and forced it off a cliff outside
Jerusalem.
   Newspapers, quoting army officials, have said recently that
Palestinians are likely to turn to firearms as their uprising nears
its third anniversary.
   Moslem fundamentalist groups have been encouraging activists to
mount more attacks, Israel television said. It said black-market
sales of guns and pistols to Palestinians in the occupied lands was
four times higher than a year ago.
   The government is also easing regulations for issuing firearms
to Israelis, the Maariv daily said, adding that thousands more
civilians will soon be able to obtain gun licenses. The measure
follows an upsurge in stabbing attacks by Arabs.
   In other violence Wednesday, a border policeman in the Gaza
Strip was shot in the head and seriously wounded during a clash
with Palestinians holding a march in advance of this weekend's
third anniversary of the anti-Israeli uprising, the army said. It
was not immediately clear who fired the shot.
   In a statement, the army said one protester was also seriously
wounded, and 22 were detained.
   In Jenin in the West Bank, masked Palestinian activists shot to
death Harab Hindawi, 43, on suspicion he collaborated with Israeli
authorities, Arab reports said.
   The death raised to 313 the number of Palestinians killed by
fellow Arabs in the uprising, most as suspected collaborators with
Israel. Fifty-three Israelis have been slain by Palestinians, and
776 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers or civilians.

<HEAD>Expert: X-ray Machine May Not Have Been Working Before Flight 103</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUMFRIES, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An anti-terrorism expert hired by Pan
Am said Wednesday he was told the X-ray machine in Frankfurt, the
German city where Flight 103 originated, may not have been working
that day.
   Retired Lt. Col Wilfred Wood told a public inquiry into the Dec.
21, 1988, terrorist bombing of Flight 103 that he had been hired by
Pan American World Airways to set up the airline's security
subsidiary, known as Alert.
   The Boeing 747, which blew up over Lockerbie, Scotland, left all
259 people on board dead and killed 11 on the ground. After
originating in Frankfurt, it stopped at London's Heathrow airport
for a transfer to the New York-bound jumbo jet.
   Wood told the inquiry, now in its 10th week, that security
official Ulrich Weber told him the day after the disaster that the
X-ray machine at Frankfurt might not have been working the previous
day. ``I was shocked rigid and very upset,'' Wood said. ``I was
appalled.''
   The machine is used to X-ray luggage to ensure it does not carry
anything suspicious.
   Police believe it was in Frankfurt that the bomb, packed in a
radiocassette recorder inside a bronze suitcase, was loaded.
   Testimony during the inquiry has indicated that Pan Am failed to
match baggage with passengers or physically search it.
   The inquiry, expected to last into next year, is looking into
possible lapses in security procedures, but it is not assessing
criminal responsibility. No one has been arrested in connection
with the disaster, but investigators have said they were checking
possible involvement by Palestinian radical groups.
   In his testimony Wednesday, Wood said the Alert security subsidy
was set up six months before the disaster.
   He said that much of the security training he recommended in
London was reduced from weeks to days. X-ray operators were trained
for an hour or two, he said.
   On Tuesday, Pan Am security chief Daniel Soneson acknowledged
that training of security staff was inadequate.

   The doctor who performed the world's first
liver transplant said Wednesday he'll perform fewer surgeries and
more research as the University of Pittsburgh creates the world's
first transplant institute.
   ``This is a switch in gears,'' said Dr. Thomas Starzl. ``It's
part of a thing that's been going on for a long time.''
   Starzl, 64, who underwent surgery in August to clear a clogged
artery near his heart, said he only will perform surgeries in cases
with unusual problems or experimental procedures.
   He made his comments on his future at a news conference to
discuss an experimental anti-rejection drug that will be tested on
people with diabetes.
   Starzl said he will concentrate on developing Pitt's
Transplantation Institute, which was chartered in 1986. It will be
modeled after the nation's leading cancer treatment institutes, he
said.
   Centers performing transplants around the world are all part of
larger hospitals or clinics, but Pitt's will be the first
free-standing facility, he said.
   Starzl attempted the world's first liver transplant in 1963 at
the University of Colorado in Denver. He performed the first
successful liver transplant there four years later.
   Starzl also pioneered techniques in kidney transplants.
   ``The field has come so far, and failures have become such a
rarity. ... In the developmental days when many patients died, the
loss was less difficult to see than the few patients who die now,''
Starzl said. ``Now, when you fail, it creates much sharper
questions.''
   Stormie Jones, 13, of White Settlement, Texas, the world's first
and longest-surviving recipient of a heart-liver transplant, died
Nov. 10 at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh when she suddenly
rejected her transplanted heart.
   Starzl, who led the team that did the heart-liver transplant in
1984, was reluctant to discuss her case Wednesday, but distributed
copies of a statement on his plans and the eulogy he delivered at a
recent Pittsburgh memorial service for Stormie and other Children's
patients.
   ``The lot of physicians who care for the desperately ill is to
reconcile grief with the determination to make things better,'' the
statement said. ``Without the sense of personal loss that goes with
a dear name and face, there is little progress and no incentive for
striving except for personal or professional ambition.''
   Pitt transplant researchers are wrestling with methods of
transplanting intestines, which patients reject easily, Starzl told
reporters.
   ``They're the Achilles heel of multiple transplants,'' he said,
but doctors were encouraged by four successful intestine
transplants that were performed here this year.

   Israeli fruit, German sausages, Italian
cheese and American medical supplies are among the products
arriving in the Soviet Union as part of a worldwide private effort
to ease winter shortages.
   While the governments of the United States, Sweden and other
countries have no formal plans yet to organize food aid, private
groups and individuals are rallying to rush food to the Soviets.
   Relief organizations have chartered planes, used Aeroflot
flights and organized truck convoys to get past the vast country's
transportation bottlenecks. Several organizations have sent staff
members to ensure that food and medicine reach their destinations.
   The Soviet government, which blames food problems on the
collapse of its central distribution system, has not officially
asked for the food. But the chronic shortages have worsened
dramaticaly this winter.
   Consumers must wait in long lines - often for as long as three
hours - for basics such as butter. Sometimes, pushing and shoving
breaks out over a scarce item.
   The country doesn't have enough rail cars or refrigerated trucks
to transport food from the fields to markets, nor are there
sufficient storage facilities. There has been widespread theft and
diversion to the black market.
   The European Community has drafted an aid package, to be adopted
next week, providing about $2 billion in food and transportation
over two years.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, meanwhile, has made deals
involving loans and export credits to buy basic foods and consumer
products to fill empty store shelves.
   But individuals and private organizations have gone ahead on
their own to help orphanages, hospitals and pensioners.
   Tore Waeraass, a Norwegian slaughterhouse owner, is driving a
truck carrying three tons of sausages to the Soviet city of
Murmansk.
   ``I'm a bit suspicious of the mafia in Murmansk. But people from
the church have promised to help us so that it will be families
with children who get the Christmas gift,'' he said.
   The first aid to reach Moscow - a planeload of food from German
charities - arrived on Nov. 29. Trucks met the Aeroflot flight and
took 25,000 packages of flour, sugar, sausage and lard to
children's hospitals and orphanages.
   The German Red Cross and the Caritas organization sent convoys
of trucks, vans and buses stuffed with food packages last week.
More caravans are planned later this month.
   And Soviet soldiers on Wednesday unloaded an emergency 10-ton
shipment of Israeli watermelons, tomatoes and oranges that Israeli
leaders said were a gesture of thanks for allowing thousands of
Soviet Jews to emigrate.
   On Thursday, Israel's quasi-governmental Jewish Agency was to
send 15 tons of powdered milk to children's hospitals in Moscow,
Leningrad and Kiev, said Yehuda Weinraub, an agency spokesman.
   In London, British children began a campaign Wednesday to
collect food for Soviet youngsters. Organizers urged every British
school child to donate a can of food and each British school to
send at least one parcel.
   A British management consultant announced a cooperative effort
with Moscow officials to improve the delivery of bread and milk in
the Soviet capital. Keith Burgess, head of a five-man team from
Andersen Consulting that spent three days in Moscow, said: ``In the
short run, we will focus on squeezing that extra bit of capacity
out of the system to make sure there is enough to eat this winter.
... In the long run, the aim is to rework the food supply system.''
   The Italian aid group ``Together for Peace'' flew 14 tons of
milk, tuna, cheese, vegetables, syringes and medicine to a
children's hospital in Moscow last weekend.
   The American relief agency CARE, concerned about the effect a
sustained shortage could have on Gorbachev's government, this week
began an operation to distribute more than 50,000 packages of food
to residents in Leningrad and Moscow.
   The Connecticut-based relief group AmeriCares sent 4,000 tons of
powdered protein drink, aspirin, and antibiotics Dec. 1 for
orphanages and children's hospitals. The aid, collected from
companies and individuals, was the first private American aid
flight into the Soviet Union, said spokesman Dwain Schenck.
   ``Our State Department says they don't see a real famine problem
and shortage. But the fact is a lot of people over there are
suffering,'' Schenck said.
   The U.S. and several Western governments say there are
shortages, but not widespread hunger.
   But some governments are taking steps to organize food aid.
Japan, which has already promised medical assistance, announced
Wednesday it would set up a clearinghouse for private food aid to
the Soviet Union.
   Switzerland plans an emergency airlift this week.
   ``The impression is that the shop shelves are empty and
refrigerators full in the Soviet Union,'' said Norwegian Church Aid
spokesman Helge Kjollesdal.
   ``But even if there is no acute starvation in the real sense,
there can easily be difficult situations at children's and old
people's homes, and among other underprivileged groups who do not
manage to hoard.''

   Negotiators involved in 107-nation free
trade talks reported failure Wednesday in their efforts to resolve
a nasty fight over farm subsidies with some trade ministers
suggesting the discussions are on the verge of breaking down.
   ``It is a stalemate and it is serious,'' said a grim-faced U.S.
Trade Representative Carla Hills.
   Officials said there would be another effort at a breakthrough
Thursday.
   ``High noon is tomorrow (Thursday),'' said Canadian Trade
Minister John Crobie. ``If there is no change, then it is over.''
   The trade ministers emerged just before midnight from a two-hour
meeting in which they sought in vain for a compromise position on
the expensive subsidies that developed countries pay to their
farmers.
   An Indian official, Commerce Minister Subramanian Swamy, was
pessimistic, saying, ``It looks like they are heading for
suspension.''
   If the talks are broken off, even for a brief time, it would put
the entire four-year effort at trade reform in jeopardy because of
the tight deadlines negotiators had faced to submit a completed
document to the U.S. Congress.
   The dispute pitted the 12-nation European Community against much
of the rest of the world, including large farm exporters such as
the United States, Brazil and Argentina.
   European officials had been expected Wednesday to agree to at
least a modest expansion of their offer to reduce internal farm
support payments by 30 percent.
   Instead, the Europeans emerged from their separate meeting
saying they had decided to make no further offer on farm subsidies
until the United States made compromises on other issues.
   There had also been hope that the European position might change
as a result of a meeting Wednesday night in Paris between German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President Francois Mitterrand.
   But following that discussion, no new offer was announced.
   Crosbie described the mood inside the discussions as ``somber''
and said the meeting Thursday would determine whether there was any
point in continuing the talks.
   ``We are going to have to decide whether we are going to give it
all up or not,'' he said.
   The farm subsidy fight evolved as the biggest stumbling block to
conclusion of the most ambitious round of trade liberalization
talks ever undertaken. The negotiations, known as the Uruguay Round
for the country where they began in 1986, had been scheduled to
wrap up Friday after five days of marathon bargaining.
   But after three days the talks remained stalemated and some
delegations talked openly about the possibility of giving up and
going home.
   ``The United States has got to recognize that this is a
negotiation between equals, not a group of people to be pushed
around in this way,'' said British Agriculture Secretary John
Gummer.
   Otto Schlecht, Germany's deputy economics minister, said, ``We
have no reason to go to the Americans on our knees.''
   Gummer said the Europeans had insisted on American compromise
offers in areas including trade in services, textiles nnd
investment to be made at the same time that discussions went
forward on the farm issue. He said the U.S. side had rejected that
proposal.
   U.S. officials said the Europeans were engaging in a desperate
attempt to shift the blame for failure of the negotiations.
   ``What is holding up the negotiations here is that the European
Community has not yet provided a proposal on agriculture,'' U.S.
Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said.
   The European Community entered the negotiations offering to trim
domestic farm support payments by 30 percent. The United States,
supported by major farm exporting countries, was seeking much
deeper cuts of 75 percent in domestic supports and import barriers
and a 90 percent cut in export subsidies.
   The trade talks, the eighth in a series of negotiations dating
to 1947, offered the promise of lowering prices for consumers while
at the same time boosting economic prosperity, especially in Third
World countries with farm-based economies.
   The United States has argued that without sufficient progress in
agriculture, developed nations will not be able to win concessions
from Third World countries to reform their trade practices
including agreement on tough new rules to protect against copyright
piracy, something that costs American businesses an estimated $60
billion in lost sales annually.
   Negotiators spoke pessimistically about a failure of the talks,
which many fear could trigger a rise of protectionism and global
trade wars, similar to the events of the 1930s that were blamed for
making the Great Depression more severe.
   ``Anyone who does not admit that the round is in deep crisis is
just deluding themselves,'' said Australian Trade Minister Neal
Blewett.

   Iraq announced Thursday it would release 36
Japanese hostages whose family members are currently in Baghdad, a
Foreign Ministry official said.
   In a meeting with the relatives of the ``human shields,'' Uday
Hussein, head of the Iraq Olympic Committee and son of Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein, told them his father had approved their
release, the official said.
   The date of their departure has not been disclosed.
   The family members have been in Iraq since Nov. 1 with Antonio
Inoki, a professional wrestler turned member of Parliament, to
negotiate the release of the hostages.
   A nationwide television broadcast showed the family members
rejoicing over the announcement.
   The Foreign Ministry has said Inoki's trip is not in line with
their policy because he is giving the impression he wants to make
concessions to Iraq, which invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone returned from Baghdad
with 74 hostages last month in a mission that drew criticism from
the U.S. government.
   More than 200 Japanese remain in Iraq, of which 78 are being
held as ``human shields'' against foreign attack in strategic
military and industrial locations, the official said.

<TEXT>
   A South Carolina viewer who saw the words
``Adultery!'' and ``Shock Therapy!'' during commercial breaks on
CBS' ``Guiding Light'' wasn't seeing subliminal messages, the
network said Wednesday.
   Because of ``a small technical problem'' in New York, the
Columbia woman saw the first part of taped promotions for Geraldo
Rivera's syndicated talk show that were supposed to appear only on
WCBS-TV in New York, the network said.
   ``It was utterly innocent,'' said a network executive who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   The brief appearance of the promotional announcements
accidentally went out on the network during the pauses it puts in
the ``Guiding Light'' daytime soap opera for local commercials
aired by affiliates, the executive said.
   The goof came to light because of the sharp eyes of viewer Julie
Moore.
   She said that while looking at episodes of the soap opera she
taped last week, she spotted the word ``Adultery!'' in large type,
imposed over the CBS logo, during a commercial break. The words
``Shock Therapy!'' appeared in the same way in the tape of the next
day's show.
   The shows appeared on the CBS affiliate in Columbia, S.C.,
WLTX-TV.
   ``I (didn't) know what it was until I ran the tape back,'' said
Moore, who said she discovered the words when she advanced the tape
slowly.
   Dick Laughridge, the station's general manager, said he was
flabbergasted when shown the videotapes Tuesday. WLTX made copies
of them and sent them to CBS officials in New York.
   Embarrassed CBS officials issued a terse statement.
   `There was a small technical problem in the way our network
computers switch to local stations,'' the network said.
   Then, alluding to the accidental transmission of the ``Geraldo''
promotions on the network, it said:
   ``Occasionally, a fraction of a second of another feed will air.
In this case, it was a promo for an upcoming show to air on WCBS-TV
in New York. We are taking steps to correct this problem.''

<HEAD>Consumer Group Seeks Recall; Chrysler Says Request `Irresponsible'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN FLESHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A consumer advocacy organization Wednesday
asked Chrysler Corp. to recall 500,000 cars and minivans equipped
with a complex automatic transmission system. The company rejected
the request as ``completely without merit.''
   The Center for Auto Safety said in a letter to Chrysler Chairman
Lee Iacocca the Ultradrive transmission had performed poorly since
its introduction in the 1989 model year and that its durability was
questionable.
   Owners complain that the transmissions stick between gears,
causing clutch burnout, computer controller failure and internal
transmission damage, said the letter from Clarence Ditlow,
executive director of the center.
   ``Ultradrive's dismal showing in its first two years on the road
earns it the dubious distinction of the world's most defective
transmission,'' Ditlow wrote.
   Chrysler spokesman Tony Cervone said Ditlow's description of
problems with the transmission were ``grossly exaggerated.'' The
recall suggestion ``is completely without merit and his allegations
regarding safety hazards in connection with this transmission are
totally irresponsible,'' Cervone said.
   The nation's third-largest automaker introduced the Ultradrive
four-speed transmission in late 1988.
   It was offered on the 1989, 1990 and 1991 Dodge Dynasty, Spirit
and Caravan minivan; Plymouth Acclaim and Voyager minivan.
   It was available as standard or optional equipment on the 1990
and 1991 Chrysler Imperial, LeBarons, New Yorker and Town &amp; Country
minivan as well as the Dodge Daytona.
   Ultradrive-equipped vehicles comprise 2.4 percent of vehicles
sold in the United States since the new transmission was
introduced. But 23.3 percent of the vehicles that have prompted
complaints to the Center for Auto Safety and the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration have had Ultradrive, Ditlow said.
   NHTSA, the safety arm of the Department of Transportation, has
received 161 complaints about Chrysler transmissions during the
1989 and 1990 model years, Ditlow said. Ranking second is General
Motors Corp., with 91 complaints.
   GM sold more than 5 million cars and trucks in 1989, while
Chrysler sold more than 2 million.
   ``The letters consumers have written point to an alarming
pattern of repeated premature Ultradrive failures,'' Ditlow wrote.
Many owners have described ``harrowing experiences'' when
transmissions gave out during travel, he said.
   Cervone said most problems with the transmissions had been
identified and fixed early in 1989, and it is ``now fully
competitive from reliability standpoints and ahead of the
competition in many other areas.''

   Most students and teachers in the New Madrid
Fault region were back in classrooms Wednesday after a two-day
earthquake break called by officials responding to a scientist's
prediction.
   New Mexico scientist Iben Browning projected a 50 percent chance
for a major earthquake this week along the fault, which runs from
Cairo, Ill., to Marked Tree, Ark.
   Earthquake experts scoffed at Browning's projection, which he
based on tidal forces, but school officials throughout souteast
Missouri and parts of Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee and
Indiana canceled classes.
   Some school districts that did not cancel classes reported
absentee rates as high as 50 percent Monday.
   Things were pretty much back to normal Wednesday and most
students were back in school. But Missouri's Scott County Central
School District didn't plan to re-open until Thursday.
   ``When you're going to have problems with your attendance, you
might as well not have school,'' said Superintendent W. Ray Shoaf.
   Dick Hilburn, assistant superintendent of schools in Kennett,
said he didn't notice any lingering earhquake fears Wednesday.
   ``If there are, I can't tell it,'' he said. ``From what I can
tell, things are going about like normal. Attendance is almost
normal at the high school, which I think is a pretty good gauge.''
   Some school officials blamed the media for exaggerating the
earthquake scare.
   ``I think they got snowed,'' Jim Mauk, business manager for the
New Madrid County Schools, said of the media. ``Browning made the
projection, but he's not the one who hyped it.''

   A motorist convicted of
driving 155 mph on the highway and trying to bribe traffic police
with his friend's car was ordered to pay $1,664 in fines, a
newspaper reported Wednesday.
   Police said Salim Ayob set a record for speeding in South Africa
when he was spotted zooming toward Durban on March 2 in a friend's
BMW sedan. After being stopped, police said Ayob offered an officer
the car. The officer refused, and Ayob then offered him $464,
prosecutors said.
   When the officer also refused that bribe attempt, Ayob allegedly
approached another policeman, who then arrested him, said the
Citizen newspaper, which reported the case.
   Ayob, 22, was convicted Monday in Heidelberg, southeast of
Johannesburg. He was fined $1,200 plus the amount of the second
attempted bribe, the paper said.

   Nine impressionist paintings stolen from
a Paris museum in 1985, including a Claude Monet masterpiece that
gave impressionism its name, have been found in Corsica,
authorities said Wednesday.
   The works, including Monet's famed ``Impression Sunrise,'' were
stolen from the Marmottan Museum in a daring daytime theft
witnessed by more than 30 people.
   Police disclosed few details about the breakthrough in the case,
but said seven people had been taken into custody on the
Mediterranean island and were expected to be transferred soon to
Paris.
   The nine paintings were found Tuesday in a villa in
Porto-Vecchio in southern Corsica.
   The stolen paintings included five Monets, two by Pierre Auguste
Renoir and one by Berthe Morisot, as well as a portrait of Monet.
Their total value was estimated at $20 million.
   Five armed men carried out the theft, getting away easily
because the museum's alarm system had been disconnected the
previous night. They were in the museum for only about 10 minutes,
and drove away after putting the paintings in the trunk of a car.

<HEAD>Judge to Decide Absentee Ballots in Berkeley Election</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge will decide if last-minute
absentee ballots can determine the outcome of a runoff for mayor of
Berkeley.
   Incumbent Mayor Loni Hancock's apparent victory margin over lead
challenger Fred Weekes was narrow enough that the outcome could
hang on absentee ballots on which the court fight is focusing.
   Tuesday's runoff was forced when Hancock, a leader of the city's
liberal Berkeley Citizens Action party, got 49.9 percent of the
vote Nov. 6, just missing the 50-percent-plus-one requirement.
BCA's liberal Democratic coalition has dominated city politics for
a decade.
   On Friday, Alameda County Superior Court Judge Howard Schwartz
will hear arguments on whether absentee ballots that arrived after
the polls closed Tuesday should be counted.
   The election code says absentee ballots can be counted only if
received by Election Day. But Hancock's opponents say as many as
3,000 of 8,000 requested ballots weren't mailed out until last
week, reaching voters as late as Monday.
   ``We won't know the number of ballots involved for a while,''
City Clerk Marie McKetchnie said Wednesday.
   Hancock led Weekes, a city councilman, by only 590 votes in
unofficial results of Tuesday's election.
   But Weekes, a moderate Democrat who wants to eliminate
``ideological practices'' from City Hall, asked the judge to allow
the counting of mail-in ballots postmarked before the polls closed
but not received until after Election Day.
   ``There are a large number of uncounted ballots out there,''
said Weekes. ``I don't know how large, but it could change the
outcome.''
   With all 116 precincts reporting, Weekes trailed Hancock 16,682
to 16,092 but led 2,403 to 1,624 among early absentee ballots.
   Depending on the judge's decision, remaining absentee ballots
could change the outcome. But a spokesman for Hancock, who during
the campaign promised to continue Berkeley's liberal tradition, was
confident the mayor would remain in office given her edge.
   ``If the absentee ballots split in the same ratio as the earlier
absentee ballots, there is no way Mr. Weekes can win the
election,'' said Malcom Bernstein, treasurer of the Hancock
campaign.
   McKetchnie's office was swamped with requests for absentee
ballots after the special election was announced.
   ``We got applications from all over the world,'' she said.
   Hancock, 52, is the most prominent member of the Berkeley
Citizens Action party, born in the fervor of the 1960s anti-Vietnam
War, youth and civil rights movements.
   The coalition lost control of the council and the rent board in
the November election. Hancock's defeat could mean the end of the
group's dominance.

   Longshoremen returned to work Wednesday
after a four-day strike that threatened to disrupt the
Philadelphia-area ports' major fruit-importing season.
   A tentative four-year agreement was reached one day after
shipping cargo clerks in Baltimore ended a two-day strike.
   The Longshoremen's contract provides a $1-an-hour pay raise per
year and bolsters pension and welfare funds, said Elwood F.
Gunther, business agent for Local 1332, International
Longshoremen's Association.
   Rank-and-file members are tentatively scheduled to vote on the
contract Dec. 18, Gunther said.
   ``I think this is a contract that all the officials can go out
and sell to the membership and vote the contract up,'' he said.
   The deal affects about 2,000 dockworkers at ports in
Philadelphia, southern New Jersey and Wilmington, Del. Their
14-month contract extension expired at midnight Friday.
   Labor agreements had been reached earlier in New York; Hampton
Roads, Va.; and in South Atlantic ports from North Carolina to
Florida.

   An explosion and a 1,000-volt electric
arc spitting sparks and smoke at a rail station prompted
authorities to evacuate about 1,000 San Francisco-bound commuters
Wednesday morning.
   No injuries were reported during the explosion and subsequent
arcing that occurred about 9 a.m. at the 19th Street Bay Area Rapid
Transit rail station, said Ray Cole, acting manager of system
safety.
   The operator of the 10-car train ordered the station evacuated.
   ``I was in the front of the train and I heard this loud bump,''
said commuter Clint Danbury, 33. ``There were lots of yellow sparks
and smoke and there was about 20 seconds of panic.
   ``One oman moaned, `Oh my God, oh my God,' but several others
said `Let's calm down.' It was pretty scary in a dark tunnel in the
ground.''
   Technicians were investigating why the rail that carries the
electrical current that powers the train began flashing and
generating sparks and smoke, Cole said.
   A heavy electrical current flashed into the metalwork behind the
wall panels on one side of the station and melted brackets
supporting decorative metal strips at the other end.
   All traffic to and from the 19th and 12th Street stations in
Oakland was shut down for about an hour, until id the group's program ``surprised
journalists and even
some members of the bloc, who were already disagreeing with some
provisions during the press conference.''
   Sentiment for a crackdown is widespread in the Communist Party,
which holds a majority in most legislative bodies on the national
and local level. Many Communists want Gorbachev to call a state of
emergency and enforce it through the armed forces and the KGB
security police.
   The National Salvation Committee seemed to have the same goals,
although they were not spelled out clearly during the news
conference called to announce the group's formation.
   The Soviet economy is crumbling. The old central system is
failing and grocery shelves in major cities are bare.
   With all but one of the 15 Soviet republics seeking some form of
independence or autonomy from central government, many officials
fear the collapse of the union.
   Yeltsin, president of the Russian republic, warned officers at
the Dzerzhinsky Military Academy in Moscow against a military coup.
   ``If the army enters our boiling society as an active factor,
confrontation will increase many times and carry the society to
catastrophe,'' he said.
   ``I am categorically opposed to any possibility of escaping the
crisis with force, oprating through the army.
   ``First of all, the army cannot solve the economic problem, and
today the economy is the greatest concern. Just the reverse: such a
development will deprive us of the last chance for a positive
result, it will deprive us of the chance to escape a civil war.''
   Yeltsin said ``any interference by the army in internal
political affairs will simply blow up the army from inside. It
could split into small groups fighting each other.''
   ``The tough political struggle, which today remains peaceful,
could grow into an armed conflict,'' he said. ``Taking into account
that we are a nuclear power, such a development would immediately
create a threat not only to life in our country but in the whole
world.''
   Yeltsin has led the drive for shifting power from the central
government to the republics. As a result, hard-liners feel he has
contributed to forces splintering the country.

<TEXT>
   An undercover drug agent who fled
Michigan because of threats against her children has returned
despite advice from police to stay away.
   After leaving Michigan, Wendy Stanek, mother of seven, worked
undercover for agents in Arizona.
   ``It got too touchy. God, if I didn't have the kids, I'd stay
out there and do it,'' Stanek said Tuesday by telephone, back in
the same Crystal Falls house she moved out of several months ago.
   Stanek took it upon herself to penetrate the drug trade in her
small hometown near the Michigan-Wisconsin line. Her free-lance
work for the state police's Upper Peninsula Substance Enforcement
Team, or UPSET, led to the December 1989 arrests of 22 people on
cocaine and marijuana charges.
   Authorities heralded the operation's success, but threats
against Stanek and her children persuaded her to move her family
four months later into hiding near Show Low, Ariz.
   Stanek, 36 and divorced, said she made slow and uneasy progress
in undercover work for the Navajo County (Ariz.) Drug Task Force.
``That's the first time I felt very uncomfortable. ... I was into
cut-off-finger times.''
   All the while, her kids were homesick for Michigan.
   ``It was the kids,'' Stanek said. ``They didn't like it.''
   Arleigh Richmond, chief deputy of the Navajo County Sheriff's
Department, said the task force had great expectations when Stanek
volunteered to do undercover work in the mountainous southeastern
Arizona county. But after two months, she failed to make any buys.
   ``We tried to work her as an agent here. We had no success,''
Richmond said. ``I think she had pretty much told everybody what
and who she was when she got here. We wasted quite a bit of money
before we found that out.
   ``I think the problem was in our situation,'' he said, referring
to Navajo County's close-knit community. ``It's very hard to work
narcotics here.''
   Richmond said he still has a high opinion of Stanek and, ``I
don't want anything negative said about the lady.''
   Stanek and her children returned to the Upper Peninsula in
mid-November.
   The Michigan drug agents for whom Stanek worked said her return
is a bad idea.
   ``She's back against our wishes,'' said Lt. Bill Johnson, the
Michigan state police detective who leads UPSET. ``We did not
encourage her to come back. We're still concerned. It will mean we
will have to take some special precautions.''
   With Stanek's testimony, Iron County Prosecutor Larry Field has
obtained convictions or guilty pleas from 16 of the 22 defendants.
Three more are awaiting trial.
   Stanek said she has had no confrontations since her return to
Crystal Falls. And life for her children has resumed peacefully
``just like we never left,'' she said.

   CNN has decided to allow court transcripts of its
Manuel Noriega prison tapes to be made public without further legal
battles, the network and its attorney said Wednesday.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler ruled Tuesday the
transcripts could be released Thursday, unless CNN decided to take
the case to a higher court.
   ``CNN has decided not to appeal,'' network attorney Terry
Bienstock said, adding that CNN's primary concern had always been
to protect its confidential source.
   ``We don't think the transcripts in and of themselves will
jeopardize the source,'' he said.
   CNN spokesman Steve Haworth said many of the conversations were
in code, and that without supporting documents, they would not be
meaningful in any case.
   Sanford Bohrer, attorney for four media organizations that asked
for the transcripts, applauded CNN's decision.
   ``I think it was the right decision because Judge Hoeveler's was
the right decision,'' Bohrer said. ``I could never understand how
CNN could claim to own conversations that were taped by the United
States government, of an inmate in a federal prison.''
   The news organizations seeking the tapes were The Miami Herald,
The Associated Press, Post-Newsweek station WPLG-TV of Miami,
Gannett Co. Inc. and USA Today, which Gannett owns. They argued the
public has a right to examine the content of tapes that set off a
free-speech controversy that went to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   CNN has televised some of the seven tapes at issue and argued
that the recordings, and therefore the transcripts, were its
property. CNN accused other news organizations of ``professional
jealousy,'' and said the transcripts should be burned or returned
to the network.
   But the judge's decision ruled the tape transcripts were public
documents because the information was originally compiled by
Noriega and the government, not CNN.
   The tapes controversy began last month when CNN aired a series
of telecasts based on Noriega's telephone conversations somehow
leaked to the network. The judge ordered the telecasts stopped
pending his review of he tapes, a move CNN opposed as
unconstitutional prior restraint of the press.
   The Supreme Court decided not to intervene, and the judge, after
reviewing the transcripts, determined there was no threat to
Noriega's right to a fair trial and said the tapes could be aired.
   CNN hasn't said where it got the tapes, but Noriega's attorneys
said the tapes were released to the government of Panama by the
State Department or the Drug Enforcement Administration, and that
Panamanians gave them to CNN.
   Noriega is awaiting trial on charges of taking $4.6 million in
payoffs to protect the cocaine trade passing through Panama from
Colombia to the United States.

<HEAD>Jewish Group Says It Would Support Trade Credits for Soviets</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group that is dedicated to helping Jews
leave the Soviet Union said Wednesday that it would not object if
the Bush administration agreed to give agriculture credits to the
Soviet Union.
   Surpluses of wheat and corn have beaten down prices, and farm
belt lawmakers are urging President Bush to lift the restrictions
on the Soviet Union so the bumper crop can be sold.
   ``We either smell it or we sell it, and this whole situation
smells,'' said Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., who slammed his hand a few
times at a House Agriculture subcommittee hearing.
   Shoshana Cardin, chairwoman of the National Conference on Soviet
Jewry, said the Soviets had made ``substantial progress'' in
allowing Jews to leave or permitting them to study, teach and
maintain their religion, language and culture.
   Another Jewish group, the Union of Councils for Soviet Jews,
said Bush should send only emergency food aid.
   To permit sales on credit, Bush would have to exempt Moscow from
a 1974 law that prohibits credit to countries with restrictive
emigration laws. In the past U.S. administrations have insisted
that the Soviet Union had to embody its emigration liberalization
into law, but last week the president said he was considering a
waiver.
   Roberts, Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., and other defenders of wheat
and corn farmers say preventing exports to the Soviet Union is
similar to a grain embargo.
   ``The amount of food moving into Soviet cities is so inadequate
that last week's newspapers were reporting Soviets literally
fighting over food in grocery stores with nearly empty shelves,''
said Glickman, who chaired the hearing of the wheat, soybeans and
feed grains subcommittee.
   ``The time is now to help (Mikhail) Gorbachev and our farmers,''
Glickman said.
   F. Paul Dickerson, associate administrator of the foreign
agricultural service, an arm of the Agriculture Department, told
lawmakers that he could not comment directly on the issue.
   He said, however, that the glut of U.S. wheat is part of a
record crop worldwide, and buying countries are not making big
purchases because they expect that prices will continue to drop.
   ``We do not anticipate that shortages will lead to widespread
hunger or imminent starvation in the foreseeable future,''
Dickerson said. ``Again, we believe that public reports predicting
famine or widespread hunger are overdrawn and premature.''

<HEAD>Canadian Network to Pull in its Belt 108 Million Notches</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBC officials announced Wednesday spending cuts of
$108 million, forcing the elimination of 1,100 jobs and the
curtailing of local television newscasts, entertainment and
children's programs.
   The shortfall is due to government funding cuts, inflation,
declining television advertising, and other costs like new taxes
and pension funding, said Gerard Veilleux, president of the
Canadian Broadcasting Corp.
   The cuts represent just under 10 percent of CBC's $1.2 billion
annual budget. About $900 million of that comes from government and
the rest from ad revenue. The CBC employs about 10,000 people, and
the layoffs are its worst ever.
   Speaking at a news conference, Veilleux said the $108 million in
spending cuts means eliminating 1,100 jobs and closing or reducing
the operations of 11 CBC television stations. The cuts go into
effect April 1, but some effects will be felt immediately.
   ``These decisions have given me many sleepless nights,''
Veilleux told CBC employees via a closed-circuit televised
announcement. ``I can only trust we're doing the right thing.''
   With the cuts, each Canadian province will have no more than one
English and one French-language station.
   Closed immediately will be stations in Goose Bay, Newfoundland,
and Matane, Quebec. The local news production at CBC Toronto will
also cease, although the network will still provide local
newscasts.
   As part of the cuts, the CBC has decided it can no longer afford
the $20-million annual cost to run Radio Canada International, the
international shortwave radio service, or the $4.5-million cost of
the English and French parliamentary channels, which broadcast
House of Commons proceedings. CBC will ask the government to pick
up the tab for these operations.
   In addition, English and French radio network budgets will be
cut by 1 percent. The following year, 2 percent will be trimmed
from their budgets.
   Newsworld, CBC's all-news cable channel, is not supposed to be
affected. However, many of its news items originate at regional
stations that will be closed.

<HEAD>School Officials Decide to Keep Twain Books as Required Reading</HEAD>

   A black parent who complained that two
classics by Mark Train were racially offensive said he was
disappointed that school board members decided Wednesday to keep
the books as required reading.
   ``There should have been more consideration given to the problem
than take it back to square one,'' David Perry said.
   Perry said he was pleased with the public review of ``The
Adventures of Tom Sawyer'' and ``The Adventures of Huckleberry
Finn.''
   ``I think the process was a good one for the community because I
think there was a dialogue ... that was very, very needed,'' he
said.
   Perry said he had high regard for 500 high school students who
circulated a petition to retain ``Huckleberry Finn,'' saying they
got a chance to hear the black perspective on the book.
   School board members capped a five-hour meeting by voting
unanimously to keep the books on the required reading list.
   Perry received a standing ovation when he accused the books of
portraying blacks in a racist, degrading manner.
   ``No matter what the depiction of time, I think any writer and
any orator who has to use the word `nigger' more than 300 times in
a presentation leaves something to be desired,'' Perry said.
   The hearing stemmed from Perry's complaint about his daughter's
discomfort while reading ``Tom Sawyer.'' At his urging, the school
board's Materials Review Committee agreed to take the books off the
required list and make them optional reading.
   Both books were written by Samuel Langhorne Clemens, who used
the pen name Mark Twain. ``Tom Sawyer,'' written in 1876, is drawn
from Twain's boyhood in Hannibal, Mo. ``Huckleberry Finn'' was
published in England in 1884 and in the United States in 1885.
   Plano students first meet Tom in the seventh grade and read
about Huck's adventures in the 11th grade.
   Among the high school students speaking in favor of the book was
Joanne Savage.
   ``To remove the book from the taught reading in the curriculum
would be a step in the wrong direction,'' she said.
   ``The book has the ability to provoke much thoughtful discussion
about this problem (racism) instead of ignoring it and pretending
that it is solved,'' Joanne said.
   After receiving complaints last year about ``Huckleberry Finn,''
the Plano Independent School District hired a University of North
Texas assistant professor in English to give teachers lessons about
how to present Huck with sensitivity.
   Perry doubted that is working.
   ``When someone assumes they can teach the word `nigger' in a way
that is not offense, I have a problem. It can't be done,'' he said.
   ``The word has a searing effect that just goes to the soul of a
black person.'' Perry said. ``By its very nature and design it is
intended to be extremely offensive, take away your identity and
destroy your soul.''
   He suggested that a better step toward sensitizing students
would be for the school district to recognize February as Black
History Month and conduct appropriate programs.

   Gordon Humphrey left the U.S. Senate for a
seat Wednesday in a state Senate that for the first time in years
has a strong Democratic presence.
   ``Well, it's not what I quite had in mind,'' the Republican
said. ``All these years I've been pretty much under a Democrat
majority and I figured, `This is really going to be great. I'll go
back, there's a big Republican margin, it'll be a piece of cake.'
   ``And here we are neck and neck.''
   A deadlock on the state Senate presidency prompted Humphrey to
make a quick move from Washington to Concord. He resigned early
Tuesday from Congress and was sworn in Wednesday to his new post.
   After hours of wrangling Wednesday, the state Senate, with 13
Republicans and 11 Democrats, had yet to elect even a temporary
presiding officer to oversee the election of a Senate president.
   With two Republicans voting with the Democrats and one Democrat
voting with Republicans, senators deadlocked 12-12 on two votes.
   ``Actually, if I wasn't here, the other side would prevail, so
it's a good thing I did it,'' Humphrey said of his decision to
resign early.
   Humphrey, 49, honored a campaign promise this year by bypassing
almost certain re-election and not seeking a third term.
   He said moving from the national limelight to relative obscurity
in a 24-member chamber has its advantages.
   ``It has a much more manageable feel to it than Congress,'' he
said. ``I think there's diversity here, but we're all from the
state of New Hampshire and it's not like trying to rectify the
interests of the entire country.''
   His first day on the job went well, he said, adding:
   ``Nobody tripped me. Everyone's very nice.''

<HEAD>Publisher And Cardinal At Odds Over Book Dealing with Catholicism</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Cardinal John O'Connor should have read a new
book that traces the Roman Catholic Church's historical treatment
of women and sexual morality before he criticized it in print, the
publisher said Wednesday.
   O'Connor, spiritual leader of the New York Roman Catholic
Archdiocese, admitted he had not read ``Eunuchs for the Kingdom of
Heaven.'' But he has read the book's dust jacket, which he attacked
as ``Catholic-bashing.''
   Thomas Cahill, director of religious publishing at Doubleday,
said the book by German theologian Uta Ranke-Heinemann is ``a
scholarly work that begs to be taken seriously.''
   ``There is something almost comical about condemning a jacket
rather than a book,'' Cahill said. ``If one wants to challenge it
... one should have read it and wrestled with its arguments.''
   The cardinal's spokesman, Joe Zwilling, said Wednesday, ``I
think Doubleday is trying to get publicity for themselves in trying
to get The New York Times to write about this.'' The Times reported
the dispute between the cardinal and the publishing house
Wednesday.
   There is ``far too much tolerance of attacks on the Catholic
Church,'' Zwilling said.
   The book, a bestseller in Germany and Italy, arrived last month
in U.S. book stores.
   Ms. Ranke-Heinemann, a professor of the history of religion at
Essen University in Germany, traces 2,000 years of the Roman
Catholic Church's attitudes toward women and sexual morality and
accuses the church of both degrading women and undermining members'
sexuality.
   ``(Catholic moral theology) is a folly that invokes God and
pretends to be religious,'' she wrote in the book. ``It has warped
the consciences of many men and women. It has burdened them with
hairsplitting nonsense and striven to train them as moral acrobats
instead of making them more humane and kinder to their fellow human
beings.''
   After receiving a copy from Doubleday last month, the cardinal
wrote about the dust jacket in a column entitled ``A Seed of
Hatred'' in the weekly publication Catholic New York.
   O'Connor wrote that he was ``not suggesting censorship for a
moment.''
   He added: ``I am suggesting that it is time we stopped `buying'
the line of purveyors of hatred and scandal and malice and libel
and calumny. It's time we tell them we are sick of their
perversions.''
   In particular, O'Connor attacked use of the word ``proves''
instead of ``contends or alleges'' to describe what the author does
in the book.
   Cahill said Peter Heinegg, who translated the book and wrote the
dust jacket description, used the word ``proves ... as it is used
in academic circles, that (the author) states her thesis and backs
it up.''
   Cahill, a Roman Catholic, said he was ``really offended'' that
the cardinal had dismissed the book in such ``a cavalier manner.''
And he was ``doubly offended by his extremely misguided attempt to
accuse Doubleday of being anti-Catholic.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush said Wednesday ``I
am not optimistic'' that Saddam Hussein will withdraw without a
fight from Kuwait and vowed that Iraq will not be offered any
concessions to end the crisis peacefully
   ``I have no feeling whatsoever that Saddam Hussein is willing to
do now that which he should have done five months ago, four months
ago,'' Bush said.
   Bush's tough approach was echoed by Argentine President Carlos
Menem of Argentina, the only Latin American leader to send frigates
to the Persian Gulf to enforce the embargo against Iraq.
   ``We wholeheartedly condemn what Iraq has done, to invade and
occupy a territory which does not belong to it,'' Menem said at a
joint news conference with Bush. ``The only way is for Iraq to
withdraw without any preconditions.''
   Midway through a tour of South America, Bush met with Menem at
Casa Rosada, the president's palace, within eyesight of the army
headquarters seized by rebels in a short-lived military uprising
Monday.
   Bush congratulated Menem for ending the rebellion quickly. ``The
Argentine people proved again this week that they will not permit
any group to return Argentina to the days of violence and
dictatorship in a superb show of strength and commitment,'' Bush
said.
   The president got a red-carpet welcome. A procession of
presidential grenadiers on horseback led Bush's motorcade to the
Hall of Congress for an address to lawmakers.
   ``Let those who would attack constitutional democracy
understand: in Latin America the day of the dictator is over,''
Bssh declared to the congress.
   Bush got his greatest applause for his remark when a deputy,
Luis Zamora of the Movement to Socialism, tried to interrupt for a
speech of his own and was shouted down by his colleagues.
   ``If that is the price you have to pay for democracy, let's pay
it,'' Bush said. ``I feel welcome here.''
   Zamora took part in an anti-Bush demonstration of about 2,00
people later, telling reporters he did not want to be part of
``this farce.''
   Bush also praised Menem for his tough free-market reforms to
cure Argentina's inflation, estimated at upwards of 2,000 percent
in 1990.
   ``We know of the painful, short-term sacrifices you are being
called upon to make, in what your own president has called `surgery
without anesthesia,''' Bush said. ``For this tremendous undertaking
to succeed, it will not take miracles, it will take work.''
   Bush was Menem's guest at an evening rodeo and a state dinner.
In his toast, the president lauded Menem, saying ``You have helped
re-establish Argentina's democratic tradition and I salute your
bold reform of the economy.''
   Bush also expressed appreciation for Menem's support in the
Persian Gulf. ``Together, we will do what is right and good,'' the
president said.
   Menem presented Bush and his daughter, Dorothy LeBlond, with two
gift horses, piebald and sorrel mounts used to herd cattle, and, at
the dinner, two knives of the kind used by Argentine gauchos -
cowboys.
   The Persian Gulf crisis a half world away continued to loom
large on Bush's tour, as well as in Washington. Secretary of State
James A. Baker III told Congress the United States will strike
``suddenly, massively and decisively'' if military force is needed
to force Iraq to withdraw.
   In Buenos Aires, Bush's mood turned solemn when he was
approached during a diplomatic reception by the Iraqi ambassador to
Argentina, Sahib-Hussain Tahir. As required by protocol, Bush
quickly shook hands with the diplomat but wore a stern look on his
face, in contrast to the warm smile he gave other ambassadors.
   Later, at the news conference Bush said there are no signs of a
deal or any retreat by Saddam despite the U.S. threat of force.
   ``I'm not optimistic,'' Bush said. ``I see no evidence that
Saddam Hussein is ready to comply fully without condition to the
U.N. resolutions.''
   Bush has authorized Baker to go to Baghdad for talks with Saddam
and has invited Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz to meet with him
in Washington. Iraqi officials have accepted Bush's offer, and say
the talks are an opening to negotiations, with give and take by
both sides.
   Bush, however, said the talks would be confined within the
limits of U.N. resolutions setting terms for peace in the Persian
Gulf.
   ``That means no concession of territory,'' Bush said. He said
Iraq also must release foreign hostages and respect the integrity
of embassies. ``And that means the eventual security and stability
in the gulf, although that's not specified in the (U.N.)
resolution.''
   Bush said there are frequent rumors about a deal to end the gulf
crisis, but that every time an Iraqi official speaks publicly, he
says they will not withdraw from Kuwait.
   Bush said there must be no attempt to find a face-saving retreat
by Saddam. ``When naked aggression takes place, it's not a question
of finding (saving) face for the aggressor,'' Bush said heatedly.
``When a country is literally raped and pillaged, should the world
go out and try to find a way to save face for he who has raped and
pillaged that country?''
   Asked by an Argentine journalist how the United States would
reward Argentina for sending ships to the gulf, Bush replied, ``I
don't believe Argentina is sending frigates to the gulf to help the
United States... They believe as we do, that we must stand up
against this brutal aggression.''
   Menem agreed that Argentina sought nothing in return. ``That
would be undignified. ... We don't want any help or aid ... and, in
fact, were it offered, we would not accept it.''
   On a separate matter, Bush said global trade talks underway in
Brussels must tackle agriculture subsidies or the talks will fail.
   He promised that ``if that round fails, we will work bilaterally
with the Argentines to see that their trade with us is not set
back.'' The European Community's reluctance to curb protectionist
measures for its farmers is jeopardizing the negotiations.
   Asked if the United States would enact retaliatory subsidies
against Europe if the talks failed, Bush said, ``I'm not in the
business of talking retaliation while people are still meeting and
discussing this.''

<TEXT>
   The U.S. defense secretary on Wednesday
wished Lech Walesa ``victory and success'' in the presidential
runoff, and two new polls indicated the Solidarity chairman was
opening up a wide lead over his rival.
   A survey by the state-owned polling service CBOS found Walesa
preferred by 58 percent in a sample of adults intending to vote in
Sunday's runoff, compared to 23 percent for emigre businessman
Stanislaw Tyminski. Nineteen percent were undecided.
   The survey was conducted between Sunday and Tuesday and had a 5
percent margin of error. It was released Wednesday night by the PAP
news agency. The number of people polled was not immediately
available.
   The private Demoskop polling agency had Walesa with a 3-1 edge
over the dark-horse challenger in a survey also published
Wednesday.
   Tyminski traveled through the southwestern Silesia region
looking for votes among coal miners worried about unemployment.
   Earlier, his campaign labeled as ``slanders and lies'' a Tuesday
night telecast in which a Canadian couple accused Tyminski of
abusing his wife and denying food and medicine to his children in
recent years.
   And in an interview published Wednesday in the pro-government
newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza, Tyminski said outgoing Prime Minister
Tadeusz Mazowiecki was ``a Stalinist'' whose governent ``chose a
totalitarian road.''
   Tyminski also said questions about his past and his
qualifications raised by the press were ``rubbish.''
   ``The press has discredited itself of its own accord,'' he said.
``They were all working for the government.''
   U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, wrapping up a two-day visit
to Poland, met for 40 minutes with Walesa at Solidarity
headquarters in Gdansk.
   ``I have certain political experience and I feel that I have
talked today with the man who will win,'' said the former
Republican congressman. ``I wish you victory and success in this
difficult task.''
   The remarks in front of reporters appeared to be a calculated
attempt to rally voters for Walesa and against Tyminski - who had
implied to coal miners on Tuesday night that he had the confidence
of U.S. authorities.
   Tyminski told a rally in the Silesian city of Jastrzebie he was
invited to meet with Cheney but preferred to be with them.
   A U.S. source, however, said Tyminski was only on the guest list
for an embassy reception for Cheney and no private meeting was ever
contemplated.
   Tyminski, leader of the fringe Libertarian Party of Canada and
an advocate of nuclear weapons for Poland, has sought to portray
himself as a business magnate with contacts with government
officials worldwide.
   He traveled to Walbrzych, one of Poland's most-polluted cities
near the German and Czechoslovak border, where five unprofitable
mines were recently slated for liquidation by the government and
addressed a rally of at least 3,000 cheering supporters at an
arena.
   The Demoskop poll indicated a Walesa lead of 61 percent to 20
percent over Tyminski, with 19 percent undecided.
   The survey, commissioned by the government-owned daily
Rzeczpospolita, questioned 988 people nationwide Tuesday. The error
margin was 3 percent.
   A poll by state TV, taken a week earlier, had Walesa leading 58
percent to 30 percent.
   Tyminski said Tuesday his own surveys indicated he was trailing
Walesa 44 percent to 50 percent, with his support growing by 1.5
percent daily.
   The accusations that Tyminski had abused his wife were made by a
woman identified as Clara Fox and her husband in a taped interview
on Polish TV Tuesday.
   The couple presented home photographs of themselves with the
Tyminskis in Toronto. Mrs. Fox said she had been Graciela
Tyminski's confidante and that Mrs. Tyminski told her of alleged
abuse by her husband. Fox said he had urged her to seek police aid,
and that a child-protection agency had become involved once.
   ``The information has nothing in common with the truth,'' said
Tyminski campaign spokeswoman Agnieska Majewska. ``We don't know
where they got the information from.''
   Tyminski acknowledged knowing the Foxes but only slightly. ``Mr.
Fox visited us two times and I threw him out because he acted in an
uncultured way. He behaved in a very un-Catholic way. He insulted
my wife and was thrown out.''

<HEAD>Stranded Whale Kept Alive in Wetsuit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A pygmy sperm whale discovered stranded on
a beach in the Florida Keys is warm and alive inside a specially
created wetsuit made of the same material worn by scuba divers.
   Fathom, named for the Orlando wetsuit manufacturer which created
and donated its yellow neoprene apparel, was discovered Nov. 26 on
Lignumvitae Key and moved to a holding tank at a hotel.
   Beaching dehydrated the whale's seven-foot, 350-pound body,
causing liver and kidney damage. In its weakened condition, the
whale stopped eating and began to lose weight, burning up the
protective blubbery sheath that keeps it warm.
   ``Statistically speaking, Fathom isn't doing very good at all,''
said Lynne Calero, medical director at the Dolphin Research Center.
``No stranded whale of her species has survived for more than four
months in captivity.
   ``But the one thing that gives me real hope is that she is
alert, in tune with her surroundings and navigating her tank very
well,'' she said. ``And she is accepting the wetsuit nicely.''
   The whale was transported to a holding tank at a Marathon motel,
where it will remain quarantined for more than a month before
joining other sea mammals at the nearby research center.
   Staff from the center, a member of the nationwide Marine Mammal
Stranding Network, have kept a 24-hour vigil over the whale,
hand-feeding it up to 20 pounds of squid a day. To keep it from
becoming dehydrated again, they pump three liters of water into its
stomach daily.
   But the most ingenious way developed to deal with the whale's
ills has been the whale wetsuit, designed to maintain the body
temperature of the warm-blooded sea creature. The device wraps the
whale from six inches below its blow hole to just above its
excretory organs.
   If the whale survives and has not suffered any permanent,
disabling physical injury, it will be released back into the wild,
Calero said.

   An auxiliary generator ignited Wednesday
on a Northwest Airlines 727 as it landed at Detroit Metropolitan
Airport. The fire was extinguished and no injuries were reported.
   Flight 582 from Seattle was carrying 69 passengers and six crew
members. ``Passengers deplaned through the usual jetway and also
down the aft stairs to the tarmac,'' Northwest spokeswoman Christy
Clapp said.
   ``It was an evacuation, but there was no emergency. The fire
already was out. They just wanted to get everyone out as quickly as
possible,'' she said.
   Clapp said the fire was spotted on an auxiliary power unit on
the right wing. A ground agent put out the fire at the gate, and
firefighters doused the plane with chemical foam to prevent another
flareup.
   Northwest was investigating.
   Monday, two Northwest flights getting ready for takeoff collided
on a runway at the airport, killing eight people.

   The Georgia Supreme Court upheld a law Wednesday
that makes it a misdemeanor for Ku Klux Klan members to wear masks
in public, ruling the statute does not violate their free speech
rights.
   In a 6-1 ruling, the court said the 1951 law is a legitimate
expression of the state's ``compelling interest'' in preventing
violence and intimidation.
   The decision reversed the ruling of a Gwinnett County judge, who
dismissed misdemeanor charges against Klan member Shade Miller Jr.,
after Miller was charged with wearing a mask in public.
   Miller, attacking the statute as unconstitutional, contended
that wearing a mask is symbolic speech protected under the First
Amendment. He also contended the law was vague and improperly
broad.
   The lower court agreed, but the Supreme Court rejected his
argument.
   Public disguise is a particularly effective means of committing
crimes of violence and intimidation, the court said in an opinion
signed by Chief Justice Harold G. Clarke.
   ``A nameless, faceless figure strikes terror in the human
heart,'' Clarke wrote. ``But remove the mask, and the nightmarish
form is reduced to its true dimensions. The face betrays not only
the identity, but also human frailty.''
   The opinion said passage of the anti-mask law was preceded by a
period of harassment, intimidation and violence against racial and
religious minorities, carried out by mask-wearing Klansmen and
other hate organizations.
   `These groups operated as vigilantes and were responsible for
numerous beatings and lynchings,'' Clarke said. ``Because of the
masks, victims of Klan violence were unable to assist law
enforcement officers in identifying their oppressors.
   ``They were afraid, perhaps, even to report such incidents in
case law enforcement officers might have been involved.''
   The lone dissent, on First Amendment grounds, came from Justice
George T. Smith.
   He found the anti-mask law unconstitutional because it is ``a
content-based restriction on political speech directed to a
dissident group in a public forum, and is not narrowly tailored to
serve a compelling state interest.''
   The law does not restrict Miller from appearing in public
wearing his robe and proclaiming his message, but does prevent him
from concealing his identity.
   The statute makes it a misdemeanor to wear in public - or on
private property except with written permission - a mask or device
which hides the person's identity.
   The law exempts the wearing of masks in traditional holiday
costumes, safety devices, gas masks in emergencies or drills and in
theatrical productions.
   Michael Hauptman, who represented Miller, claimed a partial
victory in the court's declaration that the statute applies ``only
to mask-wearing conduct when the mask-wearer knows or reasonably
should know that the conduct provokes a reasonable apprehension of
intimidation, threats or violence.''
   Hauptman said that may have left the door open for Klan members
to parade and demonstrate while masked.
   But the court indicated that any such activity would have to be
undertaken in a clearly non-threatening way in order to be deemed
legal, adding:
   ``Persons of common intelligence may readily appreciate
mask-wearing conduct that provokes a reasonable apprehension of
intimidation ... in a given context.
   ``For example, a person wearing a ski-mask in mid-winter would
not ordinarily warrant alarm, but a person wearing a ski-mask on a
warm day while entering a bank certainly would.''
   Attorney General Michael Bowers disputed Hauptman's assertion
that the ruling may leave room for masked demonstrations or
parades.
   ``If his client wears a mask, it'll make my day,'' said Bowers,
who added that the ruling ``may be the biggest decision of the
Georgia Supreme Court in 10 years in terms of beneficial impact on
the people of this state. ... I'm proud of the court.''
   The Rev. C.T. Vivian, chairman of the board of directors of the
Atlanta-based Center for Democratic Renewal, a civil rights agency,
praised the court for its decision:
   ``By their actions today, the Supreme Court has helped ensure
that Georgians will be free of the threat of anonymous terrorism
and violence by the bigotry of the Ku Klux Klan.''

<HEAD>Iraq Complains About Sanctions, But Won't Seek U.N. Aid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq said Wednesday that it would not seek
U.N. humanitarian aid, although it claims food and medicine
shortages arising from U.N. economic sanctions have killed 1,400
children.
   Iraq says the sanctions are illegal and refuses to recognize the
legitimacy of the U.N. sanctions committee that could approve such
humanitarian aid.
   Iraq charged earlier this week that 1,416 children under age 5
have died because of shortages. The Baghdad government is the sole
importer of medicine Iraq and its only official source of supply.
   A diplomat on the U.N. sanctions committee, which oversees the
embargo imposed on Iraq for its conquest of Kuwait, said Wednesday
that Baghdad has filed no formal requests for food and medicine
with the world body.
   ``Iraq has not approached the committee in any way. We've heard
and read statements that they've publicized, but they've not
approached the committee directly,'' said the diplomat, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   Medicine, and food in dire circumstances, are exempted from the
global economic embargo against Iraq and occupied Kuwait.
   But an Iraqi U.N. diplomat, speaking Wednesday on condition of
anonymity, said his embassy will not approach the sanctions
committee because it does not recognize the legality of Security
Council Resolution 661 imposing the embargo and setting up the
committee.
   Iraq has repudiated all 12 Security Council resolutions
condemning its invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   The sanctions committee is the monitor of U.N. member compliance
with the economic embargo on Iraq and occupied Kuwait and handles
requests for exemptions on banned trade.
   There was no way to independently confirm how many, if any,
Iraqi children have died because of shortages.
   But Western diplomats generally discount reports of acute food
and medicine shortages, saying Iraq in recent weeks received more
than 30 tons of medical supplies alone in exchange for the release
of foreign hostages.
   The diplomats contend that Iraq, in an effort to break the
embargo, has sought to portray the sanctions as inhumane.

<HEAD>City Puts Together New Crime Package</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERA HALLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mayor and City Council reached agreement
Wednesday on a revised crime-fighting package that would be paid
for in part by a new lottery game just for the city and tax
increases.
   The six-year, $1.8 billion ``Safe Streets, Safe City'' program
called for additional police patrols and funding for education and
the criminal justice system.
   ``We have had enough of crime, enough of bloodshed, enough of
the suffering and the tears which flow in the wake of criminal
activity,'' said Mayor David Dinkins at a news conference with City
Council Speaker Peter Vallone and other city officials.
   Dinkins had been arguing with Vallone over how many new police
the city needs and how to pay for them. State Assembly and Senate
leaders, who would have to approve most new city taxes, told both
men not to bother coming to Albany unless they could agree on a
joint approach.
   The mayor said the plan would be forwarded immediately to Albany
for consideration by the state Legislature, which is currently in a
special session.
   ``The ball is now in their court,'' Dinkins said.
   Vallone called the package a ``doable plan'' and vowed that
efforts to fight crime would no longer be used as a political
football.
   The compromise plan calls for the hiring of 3,462 new police
officers - 644 less than proposed by the mayor in his original
four-year plan announced in October.
   Dinkins said the new plan would add 9,744 officers on patrol
duty by 1994 through the hiring of new officers, the elimination of
some specialized units and the addition of civilians for
administrative positions.
   The City Council leadership offered Friday what it called its
last compromise, a six-year, $450 million plan calling for 8,856
extra officers for enforcement duty. Dinkins' four-year plan called
for 9,603 officers on patrol.
   Part of Dinkins package calls for improving the school system by
means such as better security and enhanced delinquent programs and
job opportunities.
   Tuesday's proposal also provided additional money for district
attorneys, legal aid lawyers, the correction system and drug
treatment and several after-school programs.
   ``If we had had the money in the bank, you can be sure that
today's agreement would have allowed for a program broader in scope
and more rapid in implementation,'' the mayor said. ``The reduction
in scale reflects the economic facts of life.''
   The announcement of the new crime package came at a time when
the city is attempting to bridge a budget shortfall through
cutbacks in other city agencies.
   Dinkins said funding for the proposed plan would come from three
sources: an increase in the property tax rate; an extension of the
city's surcharge on personal income tax beyond its current
expiration in 1992; and a new lottery game just for the city.
   Herb Berman, who chairs the council's finance committee, said
the effect of the property tax increase would be ``negligible.''
Berman said in the first year, the average homeowner would pay
about $10 more, with that figure growing to about $25 in the
ensuing years.
   Officials had no details about the new lottery game except that
it would be available only in the city and would yield from $50
million to $120 million each year.

   Elizabeth Taylor ignored her ex-boyfriend in
court Wednesday as their lawyers began selecting a jury to decide a
multimillion-dollar dispute over the rights to her ``Passion''
perfume.
   Miss Taylor walked across the courtroom surrounded by her
lawyers and made no acknowledgement of former beau Henry Wynberg,
seated at the opposite end of a table.
   A panel of 50 prospective jurors sat with their eyes riveted on
the actress, dressed in purple, as the judge explained what the
trial was all about.
   Miss Taylor won permission earlier in the day to tell jurors
about Wynberg's criminal record after her lawyers said it would
explain her decision to keep him out of her perfume business.
   Lawyers for Henry Wynberg sought to prevent jurors from hearing
that Wynberg - who courted Miss Taylor between her two marriages to
Richard Burton - once pleaded guilty to statutory rape, providing
drugs to underage high school girls in return for sex and taking
pornographic photos of young girls.
   They called the evidence ``irrelevant, inflammatory and
prejudicial.''
   But Miss Taylor's lawyers argued that those issues were crucial
to proving that she was justified in breaking off her business
relationship with Wynberg ``because any reputable cosmetics company
would refuse to deal with Wynberg.''
   Superior Court Judge Coleman Swart declined to bar the evidence.
   Wynberg claims he conceived the actress' line of ``Passion''
perfume, and he's seeking a hefty share of the profits. He says he
created the fragrance under the Elizabeth Taylor Cosmetics Inc.
banner.
   At stake: about $70 million a year in profits.
   Litigation has produced volumes of depositions and affidavits
about Wynberg's claim that he had a contract with Miss Taylor for
exclusive rights to her name and likeness for promotion and sale of
cosmetics. Wynberg sued in 1986 for 72 percent of ``Passion''
profits.
   Court documents show Wynberg's two-year romance with the
violet-eyed actress ended in August 1975, when Miss Taylor said,
``I'm going back to Richard, Henry. I'll see you later.''
   Burton and Miss Taylor remarried in Africa, and Wynberg returned
to California. Court records show that a short time later, Miss
Taylor and Wynberg signed the cosmetics agreement in Switzerland,
with Burton as a witness.
   Wynberg said he spent years consulting with chemists and
manufacturers, smelling perfumes and looking for the perfect
bottle.
   ``I wanted sparkling little lights like stars in there, and I
wanted it to look like money, feel like money,'' Wynberg said.
   According to Wynberg, Hen he presented the actress with the
heart-shaped bottle and fragrance in November 1983, Miss Taylor
said: ``Let's let bygones be bygones, Henry. Let's split 50-50 on
the perfume deal.''
   In a deposition, Miss Taylor denies Wynberg's assertion. ``I
didn't want to do any business with him,'' she said.
   Miss Taylor contends that Wynberg's failure to follow through on
the project violated the contract and made it invalid.
   In 1986 she signed with the Chesebrough-Ponds Inc. cosmetics
company to market ``Passion'' using her name and likeness. It went
on to be a big seller.

   Anatoly Karpov pulled even in the world
chess championship with a victory Wednesday after reigning champion
Garry Kasparov resigned on the 40th move of Game 17.
   ``I feel very confident now,'' Karpov said. ``It was quite clear
that he was not in good shape.''
   The two Soviet grandmasters are now tied 8.5 points each with
the next game scheduled for Saturday.
   Kasparov had gone one point ahead Tuesday when he won the
marathon 16th game after 102 moves played over four days. But
Karpov, with the white pieces on Wednesday, evened the match.
   The first player to gain 12.5 points wins the championship and
$1.7 million of a $3 million purse. In the event of a tie, Kasparov
retains the title. The first 12 games were played in New York.
   After forcing Kasparov's resignation Wednesday, Karpov said,
``It was a very complicated game, but I felt I always had the
advantage.''
   The game began with a familiar scenario. As the two previous
games in Lyon with Karpov playing white, the opening was a Grunfeld
with an exchange variation as Kasparov castled on the eighth move.
But Karpov moved his knight into deeper territory on the 10th move.
   That caused Kasparov almost 30 minutes of reflection before
countering with a pawn exchange, then bringing a knight forward.
   Each player is allowed 2{ hours for his first 40 moves.
   Karpov wasted his time advantage on the 25th move when he had to
decide how to capture a black knight. He finally did so with a
bishop.
   Now both players had less than 30 minutes for 15 moves. But the
game turned in Karpov's favor when he advanced a queen and
established a rook deep in black territory.
   Kasparov tried to get out of trouble, but Karpov kept advancing.
Karpov even moved a pawn to the seventh rank, blocking the black
queen and attacking a rook.
   Kasparov gave up two moves later.

   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein conferred
Wednesday with former U.S. Treasury Secretary John Connally, who is
hoping to negotiate the release of employees of a Texas oil
company.
   Connally, a member of the board of Coastal Corp., was
accompanied by Oscar Wyatt, head of the Houston-based oil and gas
company, the official Iraqi News Agency reported.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, said those attending the
meeting also included the speaker of the National Assembly, Sadi
Mehdi Saleh.
   The agency gave no details of the talks.
   But the presence of Saleh indicated hostages were discussed.
Previous deals that led to the release of foreigners were cleared
first by the National Assembly, or Parliament.
   Diplomats in Baghdad reported Tuesday that Connally was in Iraq
to negotiate on behalf of some Western hostages linked to Coastal
Corp. But they did not know how many people are involved.
   Hundreds of Americans are trapped in Iraq and Kuwait, which Iraq
invaded Aug. 2. Some are being held at strategic military and
industrial sites to fend off a possible attack.
   Iraq has been allowing hundreds of hostages to leave after
appeals by visiting foreign politicians, private firms and
humanitarian groups.

   A Tennessee National Guard officer was
found dead in his tent in Saudi Arabia of a gunshot wound, military
officials said Wednesday.
   Lt. Col. Joe Hancock, 49, died Tuesday night, said Maj. Gen.
Carl D. Wallace, the Tennessee guard's adjutant general.
   A Pentagon spokesman said no foul play was suspected and the
death was under investigation.
   Neither Wallace nor the Pentagon would provide details.
   Hancock, from Nashville, commanded a unit that coordinates
security, communications and other activities.
   ``We're all very shocked and very distraught,'' said Julia Dyer,
Hancock's sister-in-law.
   Hancock left Sept. 16 for Saudi Arabia as part of Operation
Desert Shield, the military buildup in response to Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait.
   ``He has served in the Tennessee Army National Guard for a
number of years and we are saddened by his untimely death ...,''
Wallace said.
   The Pentagon spokesman, Army Lt. Col. Terence Meehan, said
Hancock was the 52nd person to die during Operation Desert Shield.
Three were from natural causes, one was a suicide and 47 were
accidental.

   House Democrats on Wednesday tossed out two
senior committee chairmen but a third survived a last-minute
challenge.
   In a secret ballot, Rep. Glenn Anderson, D-Calif., chairman of
the Public Works and Transportation Committee, failed to win
another term by a tally of 152-100.
   Anderson later was replaced by the second-ranking Democrat on
the panel, Rep. Robert Roe of New Jersey, who defeated the No. 3
member, Rep. Norman Mineta of California, on a vote of 121-107.
   Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., failed by just two votes, 127-125,
to win another two years as chairman of the Committee on House
Administration, which runs the House bureaucracy.
   To succeed Annunzio, Democrats elected Charles Rose of North
Carolina, the panel's third-ranking member, who defeated
second-ranking Joseph Gaydos of Pennsylvania on a 158-64 vote.
   House Banking Committee chairman Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, was
the only other committee chairman to face a serious challenge. Rep.
Bruce Vento, D-Minn., launched a late effort to unseat him but
Gonzalez was re-elected, 163-89.
   In the cases of the ousted incumbents, there appeared to be no
national policy dispute. The issue was the individuals.
   ``People were talking about effectiveness,'' said Rep. Gary
Ackerman, D-N.Y.
   The votes also reflected the decline of the seniority system in
the House. The large number of Democrats who entered the House in
the post-Watergate elections of the 1970s have grown increasingly
impatient to take over.
   Even Rep. Morris K. Udall, D-Ariz., one of the best known and
most popular senior members, had 47 votes cast against his
re-election as Interior Committee chairman. Udall, 68 and suffering
from Parkinson's disease, plans to retire after the next Congres
but some younger members want him to hand over the reins sooner.
   Anderson, 77, inherited the chairmanship of the Public Works
committee two years ago after the death of Rep. James Howard of New
Jersey. Although he was elected to a full term in the post for the
101st Congress, younger members questioned his aggressiveness and
Mineta openly challenged him.
   In the case of Annunzio, 75, lawmakers said privately that he
had lost control of his committee staff and the panel was not
responsive to members' needs.
   Gonzalez, 74, was in hot water with fellow Democrats because he
made a campaign commercial for his Banking Committee's senior
Republican, Chalmers Wylie of Ohio.
   Other Democrats said he was forced to deliver an apologetic
speech to the caucus, but his public statement was bullish,
crediting himself for leading the committee ``through the
firestorm'' of the savings and loan crisis.
   The Democrats also elected two new chairmen for other
committees.
   Rep. William D. Ford, D-Mich., gave up his chairmanship of the
Post Office and Civil Service Committee to replace the retired
Augustus F. Hawkins of California as chairman of the Education and
Labor committee. Rep. William Clay, D-Mo., moves up to Ford's old
job.

   The first Marine to refuse deployment under
Operation Desert Shield was granted an administrative discharge
Wednesday, Marine Corps officials announced.
   Court martial proceedings against the Marine, Jeff Paterson,
were dismissed under the agreement. In return, Paterson will halt
all legal action against the Corps stemming from its rejection of
his request for conscientious objector status, said a military
spokesman and Paterson's attorney.
   Paterson had his rank reduced from corporal to lance corporal
under the agreement.
   In another dispute, a soldier whose active-duty enlistment was
extended without his consent because of the Persian Gulf crisis
filed suit Wednesday against President Bush and Army officials for
breach of contract.
   The four-year active-duty tour of Spec. Sebastian Correa was to
have ended Nov. 24. In early September he was asked if he wanted to
re-enlist; he declined. Two weeks later, Correa was sent to Saudi
Arabia, and two weeks after that he learned his tour was extended
until December 1991.
   Paterson, 22, was accused of violating orders following his
refusal to board a plane for Saudi Arabia with his unit Aug. 29. He
also was charged with unauthorized absence Aug. 16, when he failed
to report for duty.
   The Marines rejected his request for objector status, saying it
was based on political rather than moral considerations, saying
they thought Paterson didn't oppose war in all forms and wasn't
sincere in his beliefs.
   A statement issued Wednesday from Paterson's commanding officer
at the Kaneohe Marine Corps Air Station, Brig. Gen. R.L. Phillips,
said it would be too disruptive and time-consuming to have officers
deployed in Saudi Arabia give depositions in the Paterson case.
Phillips also said he was satisfied that Paterson had ammitted
guilt in his dismissal request and that all lawsuits would be
dropped.
   Paterson's attorney, Eric Seitz, said, ``The government had
legal concerns about what the outcome would be. The case has been a
source of publicity and great embarrassment to the military.''
   Correa's tour was extended under a military program known as
``stop-loss,'' intended to maintain troop strength during Operation
Desert Shield.
   ``We have researched the law thoroughly and we feel an automatic
extension ... can only be enforced when Congress has declared war
or the president has declared a national emergency,'' Correa's
attorney, Ellis Rubin, said before filing the lawsuit in U.S.
District Court in Miami.
   Defense Department spokesman Maj. Doug Hart cited a code section
that overrules all others and specifies that the president can
suspend laws regarding separation as the basis of the Army's
stop-loss program.
   Rubin said his client has a satisfactory service record and
isn't seeking to leave the Army, just to change his status.
   Correa, 24, is an auto mechanic with the 18th Aviation Brigade
based at Fort Bragg, N.C. The lawsuit maintains his services aren't
essential to the success of Desert Shield.
   In two other conscientious objector cases:
   -Pvt. Alfred Edwin Esquibel Jr., who refused to carry a gun to
Saudi Arabia, was discharged Tuesday from the Army on grounds of
fraudulent enlistment, said Bill Harralson, Army spokesman at Fort
Campbell, Ky. He said Esquibel committed fraud when he joined the
Army in January 1989 and indicated he was not a conscientious
objector. Esquibel later filed for conscientious objector status.
   -A special court-martial, which carries a lighter sentence than
a general court-martial, was recommended for a Fort Riley, Kan.,
soldier who has refused to go to the Persian Gulf. Sgt. George
Morse was charged with refusing orders to prepare equipment for
transport to Saudi Arabia.
   Morse plays trumpet in the 1st Infantry Division band but was
assigned to division headquarters as a military police officer. The
1st Infantry was activated Nov. 8, and Morse requested
conscientious objector status Nov. 23.

   Improved ground radar designed to prevent
planes from straying onto the wrong runway was on order at
Detroit's airport, where two jets crashed on a fog-shrouded runway
this week, investigators said Wednesday.
   It was not certain the new equipment, which tracks vehicle and
aircraft movement on runways, would have prevented the accident
Monday that killed eight people, said Fred Farrar, a spokesman for
the Federal Aviation Administration.
   The equipment, ordered before the collision, is to replace
existing ground radar at 29 airports, including Detroit, over a
three year period beginning in 1991, he said.
   Farrar said the new equipment ``will eliminate a rather serious
flaw with (the existing equipment), which cannot see through heavy
rain.''
   ``It gives us a video map of the airport on the radar screen,''
Robert Bartanowicz, supervisor of the FAAn Academy in Oklahoma
City, said Tuesday. ``It can paint runways, ramp areas and pickup
targets such as trucks and aircraft.''
   Investigators continued Wednesday to interview crew members and
witnesses and examining debris.
   The accident's cause is still under investigation and a final
report is not expected for up to a year, said Alan Pollock,
spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board.
   ``It isn't our business to rush to judgment, and it takes nine
to 12 months'' to complete a final report, Pollock said.
   Twenty four people were injured when their Pittsburgh-bound DC-9
began taxiing down a runway in heavy fog at Detroit Metropolitan
Airport and was scored by the right wing of a Boeing 727 taking off
in the opposite direction.
   Both were Northwest Airlines jetliners.
   No one aboard the Memphis-bound 727 was injured, but the impact
tore loose the DC-9's rear engine. Spilled fuel from both planes
ignited the smaller plane's fuselage.
   The DC-9 pilot, Capt. William Lovelace of Phoenix, complained he
was lost in the fog moments before the collision, said a transcript
of a cockpit-tower conversation obtained by NBC.
   Federal investigators, while refusing to confirm the precise
conversation between the pilot and an air traffic controller, said
Tuesday the DC-9 crew had trouble finding its way just before the
collision.
   Northwest said Lovelace, 52, was making his first flight without
another pilot observing since his return last week from a five-year
medical leave. First Officer James Schifferns, 43, of Spokane,
Wash., joined the airline in March, Northwest said.
   John Lauber, head of the safety board investigation, said
Wednesday Schifferns insists he told the flight tower just before
the collision he thought their plane was on an active runway set
aside for takeoffs.
   Lovelace told investigators he never heard that comment from
Schifferns and if he had he ``would've gone for the weeds'' on the
side of the runway, Lauber quoted the pilot as saying.
   Also Wednesday, a passenger who said he helped others escape
from the DC-9 sued Northwest, seeking unspecified damages for
injuries he suffered. Milio Rinna's lawsuit was filed in Wayne
County Circuit Court.
   Rinna, 60, a United Steelworkers union health and safety
official, suffered burns and other injuries to his hands, head and
knees, said his attorney, William L. Martens. Rinna was treated and
released at a hospital, Martens said.
   Northwest Airlines spokesman Bob Gibbons in Minneapolis did not
immediately return a telephone call to his office Wednesday seeking
comment on the lawsuit.
   The safety board told Congress months ago that planes straying
onto the wrong runways are among an airport's greatest hazards.
   Through the end of October, 220 such incidents were recorded at
U.S. airports this year, the FAA said. That compares with 223
recorded for 1989, 179 in 1988 and a record 382 in 1987.
   At Detroit, there were 11 such incidents in 1987, nine in 1988,
eight in 1989 and two this year.
   In most cases, the pilots entered a runway without control tower
clearance, the FAA said.
   Lauber told a U.S. House subcommittee in March the agency spent
five years studying runway incursions and ways to prevent them.
   ``Those accidents that have occurred and the numerous close
encounters that we hear about two or three times every week,
convince us that we are relying too heavily on perfect human
performance combined with a bit of luck to assure the safety of
landing and departing traffic,'' Lauber told the panel.

<HEAD>Official Handling Industrial Poisoning Case Commits Suicide</HEAD>

   The chief government official handling a damage
suit by victims in the Minamata industrial poisoning case hanged
himself at his home Wednesday, police said.
   The government recognizes more than 2,000 people as sufferers of
Minamata disease, caused by mercury poisoning. The suit against
defendants, including the central government, has 1,114 plaintiffs.
   Toyonori Yamanouchi, 53, chief of the Environment Agency's
planning and coordination bureau, left a note before his suicide,
but details have not been released, said a police official on
condition of anonymity.
   An agency official, also speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Yamanouchi had been busy recently as the top official on the
government team handling the damage suit. Yamanouchi was shifted to
that post on July 10 from the agency's nature conservation bureau,
he added.
   Another official said Yamanouchi had been working until midnight
daily for the last month in preparation for a trip to Minamata.
   The fishing village in southwestern Japan became the focus of
Japan's first major controversy over industrial pollution 22 years
ago.
   In 1980, the plaintiffs sued the central government, the
Kumamoto local government and the chemicals' manufacturer, Chisso
Corp. They say they have Minamata disease, caused by organic
mercury compounds that enter the body when the victim eats
contaminated fish.
   At least 700 people have died of the disease.
   In September 1968, the government held that the disease was the
result of discharges from the acetaldehyde synthesizing plant of
Chisso Corp.
   The Kumamoto District Court ruled in 1987 that the central
government and the Kumamoto local government had been negligent and
ordered them to pay a total of $4.9 million to 110 people. The case
is still under appeal.

<TEXT>
   U.S. troops arrested a Panamanian
former senior police official Wednesday after he escaped from
prison and seized national police headquarters with his followers
in what the president called a coup attempt.
   Former Col. Eduardo Herrera and about 50 armed supporters
surrendered after shots were fired.
   A police officer was reported killed and three civilians were
reported injured during the fray.
   Herrera and 35 followers were arrested and are being held by
Panamanian authorities for trial, Vice President Ricardo Arias
Calderon told reporters. He said about 15 supporters escaped before
they could be taken to a police compound.
   Herrera himself made a brief getaway after surrendering, but
U.S. troops captured him at a building nearby.
   It marked the first challenge to the government of President
Guillermo Endara, who was installed one day after the United States
invaded Panama on Dec. 19, 1989, and toppled Gen. Antonio Manuel
Noriega.
   Herrera, a former Noriega associate, said his intention was not
overthrow, but to gain more respect and better pay and benefits for
police.
   Endara told reporters Wednesday night, ``The punishment for all
the military and civilians who participated in the attempted
military coup will be exemplary. The administration of justice will
be expedited ... because the people rightly want it.
   ``The attempted coup has been completely foiled.''
   The attempt coincided with a call for a 24-hour strike by
Panama's 100,000 public employees to back demands for higher wages,
more fringe benefits and relaxation of government economic
austerity measures.
   The Coordinator of Union, an umbrella group that includes
leaders sympathetic to Noriega, called the walkout.
   A telephone survey indicated about 30 percent of the workers
took part, mostly in the capital. Endara said the government will
fire the strikers.
   He spoke to reporters shortly before meeting a U.S. delegation
headed by Ambassador Deane R. Hinton and Brig. Gen. George Joulwan,
chief of the U.S. Southern Command. What they talked about was not
disclosed.
   Sgt. Sabino Hernandez, a police spokesman at Santo Tomas
Hospital, said Sgt. Telemon Montero Del Rosario was dead upon
arrival there, shot in the left side, and that Armando Canto, 29,
was treated for a bullet wound in the thigh.
   Photographer Daniel Espinoza of the newspaper Panama America was
injured by a blow to the head. Domingo Romero, a reporter for
Critica newspaper, was also hurt.
   Herrera was awaiting trial on conspiracy charges when he escaped
aboard a private helicopter Tuesday from prison on Nao Island in
the Pacific . He said Wednesday that police force members were on
that helicopter.
   He and his backers took over police headquarters in Panama City
early Wednesday after vainly trying to persuade some police units
to join them.
   Panamanian troops surrounding the building were joined by U.S.
soldiers at Panama's request, the U.S. Embassy said.
   A Southern Command news release said about 500 soldiers of a
joint U.S.-Panama task force ``were involved in assisting the
National Police at the request of the Government of Panama in
protecting American and Panamanian citizens.''
   The United States maintains about 12,000 troops in Panama to
protect the Panama Canal until Panama takes it over at the end of
the century.
   Herrera met U.S. and Panamanian officials while holding police
headquarters, then later walked out, surrounded by armed supporters
and by journalists trying to question him.
   In the confusion, Herrera managed to get away in a car, but was
caught soon after.
   Herrera belonged to Noriega's Defense Forces, but had been on
the outs with Noriega, who forced him to leave Panama by naming him
ambassador to Israel prior to the U.S. invasion.
   He returned to Panama after Noriega was jailed in Miami on drug
charges, and became deputy police chief in January.
   He was fired in August and jailed in October on charges of
conspiring against Endara's government.
   A third journalist was injured while covering the story
Wednesday. Zoila Rodriguez Jovane, a newswoman for La Prensa
newspaper, said she was roughed up and bruised by muggers who stole
her purse.

<HEAD>Daily News Sues Eight People Charged With Blocking Distribution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Daily News filed $100,000 lawsuits Wednesday
against eight people who face criminal charges of blocking the
tabloid's distribution.
   Among those sued was Joseph Martin, a truck driver for The New
York Times who allegedly smashed his truck into a News vehicle
driven by a replacement worker Nov. 3.
   The lawsuit alleged the replacement driver suffered severe
injuries in a subsequent assault by Martin.
   Theodore Kheel, spokesman for nine News unions that have been on
strike for six weeks, called the lawsuits unfounded. He said the
unions will challenge them.
   ``This is another of the continuing acts of desperation of a
newspaper going down the drain with only one possible solution at
this time, which is to stop suing, to stop yelling and to sit down
at the bargaining table and reach fair and equitable agreements,''
Kheel said.
   The eight face criminal charges of blocking the newspaper's
distribution.
   Earlier, the News filed a federal lawsuit alleging racketeering
by the unions in blocking newspaper distribution. It also has filed
lawsuits against three other people accused of strike-related
violence.
   John Sloan, a News vice president, would not comment on
negotiations between management and unions and referred calls to a
federal mediator.
   The first afternoon version of the newspaper in nine years was
hawked for a second day Wednesday. Management officials said the
new edition had a 30,000-copy run, but there were no figures on how
many copies were sold.
   Hawkers selling the newspaper in the subway Wednesday were met
by striking News employes who handed out boycott leaflets. The
unions have dismissed the new afternoon edition as an act of
desperation.
   The afternoon edition is an effort to regain circulation and
advertising lost since the strike began Oct. 25.
   The News has published every day, but its prestrike weekday
circulation of 1.09 million, making it the nation's third largest
metropolitan daily, has dropped by more than 50 percent.
   Advertising revenue has plunged. The News expects to lose up to
$35 million in this quarter and about $85 million for the year. The
newspaper lost $115 million from 1979 through 1989.

<HEAD>Drifter Says He Was Sorry Actress Theresa Saldana Didn't Die</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Scottish drifter convicted of savagely
wounding actress Theresa Saldana in a knife attack eight years ago
told jurors Wednesday he was sorry she didn't die.
   ``Unfortunately, I would've preferred a gun,'' Arthur Jackson
said. ``In addition to being more efficient, it would've been more
humane. ... I regret very much the extent of her wounds.''
   Jackson, 55, said his 10-year mission to be executed at San
Quentin suffered a setback when Saldana didn't die from the attack,
despite being stabbed repeatedly by Jackson with a 5{-inch knife.
   ``My divine mission is to volunteer as a candidate for supreme
sacrifice by way of death by shooting or cyanide gas at San
Quentin,'' Jackson said.
   Jackson was convicted of attempted murder and assault with a
deadly weapon for knifing Saldana outside her West Hollywood
apartment in 1982.
   He is on trial on five felony counts of sending letters
containing death threats to Saldana while he was in prison. If
convicted, Jackson faces up to 11 years in prison under a 1986 law
that bars freeing felons who threaten victims.
   Jackson was expected to take the stand again Thursday.
   Tuesday, Saldana testified that Jackson vowed to stab her again
in the letters.
   ``He swore on the ashes of his dead mother and the scars of
Theresa Saldana that he would complete his mission of killing me,''
she said.
   Jackson eventually will be turned over to the Immigration and
Naturalization Service for deportation on charges pending in his
homeland. The charges involve murder committed during a burglary.
   Before finishing his testimony, Jackson confessed to the 1960
murder in London.
   He also claimed he was subjected to ``mind control experiments
with the U.S. Army and was a ``victim of witchcraft since
childhood.''
   Miss Saldana, who starred in the 1980 film ``Raging Bull,'' was
stabbed 10 times and needed a transfusion of 16 pints of blood and
1,000 stitches. She was hospitalized 3{ months and has had five
major operations.
   Jackson's 12-year sentence for the knife attack was halved
because of good behavior. He was to be released last April but the
new charges, filed in March, kept him in prison.
   Prosecutors contend Jackson sent seven threatening letters in
1988 from Atascadero state hospital, many of which referred to an
89-page letter begun in 1982 and finished in 1984.
   The letters were sent to a reporter and turned over to a
producer of the ``Geraldo'' television show. They eventually were
forwarded to Miss Saldana's security adviser, Gavin De Becker.
   Jackson admitted he sent the letters, but said the threats were
not serious and they were never intended to reach the actress.
   Deputy Public Defender Norman Kavan said it would be hard to
prove that Jackson was able to send the threats from his cell. He
also noted that the letters were sent to the reporter and not to
the actress.
   ``There was no intent to communicate to Miss Saldana,'' said
Kavan.

<HEAD>City Transit Authority Proposing More Subway and Bus Cuts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Transit Authority, facing a $102 million
deficit next year, proposed a new round of bus and subway service
cuts Wednesday to save an additional $2.3 million.
   The agency proposed a $2.7 billion operating budget last month
that called for $18.5 million in savings by cutting service and
eliminating 1,406 jobs. Wednesday's proposal brought the total
savings to $20.8 million.
   Some board members at the Transit Authority's parent, the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said they want the budget
trimmed still more because they want to present the leanest
possible budget when they request funding from state legislators
battling a state deficit.
   At an MTA Finance Committee meeting, Transit Authority President
Alan Kiepper assured board members his staff is working on further
cuts.
   The Transit Authority foresees a deficit next year of $102
million caused by falling subsidies from the state and revenues
reduced by decreased ridership and farebeating.
   The proposed savings would come through cuts in bus and subway
service, closing more subway token booths; making on-board
collections; and using buses in place of some subway trains in some
places.
   Transit Authority staffers estimate that 3 percent of the
system's 3.5 million daily riders would be affected.
   A fare increase from $1.15 to $1.25 is also under consideration.
   The Transit Authority budget goes to the MTA board for approval
Dec. 20. Any changes would then go before public hearings in late
January or early February.

   Radioactive steam escaped from a
leaky pipe in a reactor at the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant
but posed no threat to the public, a utility spokesman said
Wednesday.
   The leak occurred in Unit 2, along a weld in a pipe that carries
cooling water between the reactor and a purifying system, said Brad
Thomas, spokesman for Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co.
   Workers discovered the leak Tuesday during routine work in a
reactor containment building, Thomas said. None of the
radioactivity was released into the environment, he said.
   Greg Cook, spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
described the incident as minor.
   ``It's not a high-volume leak. It doesn't endanger the reactor
or the public,'' Cook said. He said the agency was working with the
company to determine the cause of the leaks.
   ``Usually when you've got several leaks like this in the same
system, it's caused by vibration,'' Cook said. ``But the company
has checked for vibration and found nothing unusual.''
   Repairs on the pipe were expected to take a week to 10 days.
Officials switched to a backup system to keep the reactor operating
at 100 percent power.
   The plant's other reactor, Unit 1, remained operating at full
power, Thomas said.
   Diablo Canyon is on the central coast in San Luis Obispo County.

   Columbia's astronauts got in twice
as much star-gazing Wednesday, but remained far behind and nowhere
near full speed because of problems with the shuttle's $150 million
observatory.
   ``We're trying as hard as we can,'' astronaut-astronomer Ron
Parise told ground controllers at the end of his 12-hour shift.
   Parise and astronaut Robert Parker, hampered by a jittery
instrument pointing system, got in 35 percent of the observation
time planned for their shift. Seventeen percent was accomplished in
the crew's previous work period and none before that, said mission
scientist Ted Gull.
   Although Gull could not say when the Astro observatory might
reach peak efficiency, he was confident further fine-tuning would
increase viewing time. The 10-day shuttle mission ends Tuesday.
   ``We're starting to think science ... and that is what it's all
about,'' Gull said.
   Among Wednesday's observations were a white dwarf star - a star
near the end of its life; a galaxy that's 41 million light years
away and is believed to contain a black hole; and Crab Nebula, a
remnant of a supernova that occurred more than 900 years ago.
   Later, astronaut Samuel Durrance manually focused one telescope
on a bright quasar 1 billion light years away and held it steady
for 30 minutes. The target, the brightest quasar in the sky, was a
prime observation for the Johns Hopkins University telescope.
   ``Sam was the one who was actively guiding the quasar into our
aperture. It's his steady hand to which we owe our success with
this one,'' said Arthur Davidsen of Hopkins. ``We missed this the
other day because of IPS (instrument pointing system) problems.''
   The astronauts took time Wednesday night to sing ``Happy
Birthday'' to Beverly Brand, wife of Columbia commander Vance
Brand, and Barbara Hoffman, wife of mission specialist Jeffrey
Hoffman.
   ``I'd like to say to Bev that you're very special and I've
appreciated your support all along. Just hope you've had a happy
day, a very happy birthday - I won't ask how old you are or Barbara
is either,'' Brand said.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration had hoped to
start making scientific observations with Astro late Sunday, but
had to delay work because of trouble with the pointing system's
star trackers.
   As Astro's pointing problem dragged on, scientists removed more
targets from the viewing lineup. About 250 celestial sources of
ultraviolet light and X-rays were supposed to have been studied,
including galaxies, quasars and a supernova.
   The four astronomers aboard Columbia manually operated Astro's
pointing system for the third straight day Wednesday, using a
joystick and keyboard to steer the three ultraviolet telescopes
toward desired stars. When possible, the telescopes were aimed
automatically, normally a quicker and more precise method but
impeded by a bad star tracker.
   At one point, Spacelab Mission Operations Control's John David
Bartoe informed the astronauts that ``this is by far the most
stable pointing we've seen so far.''
   ``Except that the target isn't in the aperture'' of the
telescope, Parise replied.
   New software was transmitted Wednesday to correct the star
tracker's sensitivity to light and hopefully improve its sighting
of dim stars.
   Observations were briefly halted Wednesday afternoon when one of
four small jets in Columbia's aft failed because of a helium bubble
in a fuel line. While it was out, the telescope lenses were covered
for protection.
   There were moments of excitement amid the exasperation.
   NASA scientist Randy Kimble was elated with observations of the
white dwarf star by the Johns Hopkins University ultraviolet
telescope, with which he works. The star has never been studied
with such sensitivity or resolution, he said.
   Because the astronauts had to manually operate the system, the
observation lasted only two-thirds as long as planned.
   Morton Roberts, senior scientist at the National Radio Astronomy
Observatory in Charlottesville, Va., will have to wait until
Columbia returns to Earth before he sees pictures of galaxies taken
by NASA's ultraviolet imaging telescope. Its observations are
recorded on film that will have to be developed.
   ``It's like that wonderful trip you took abroad with the family,
taking pictures of the kids in front of the Eiffel Tower and the
pyramids. You want to see what it looks like, but you have to wait
until you get home,'' said Roberts, one of the telescope's
co-investigators.
   Astro's X-ray telescope, which has its own pointing system,
began operating Wednesday after falling out of alignment late
Tuesday. The instrument is managed by computer commands sent from
Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.
   Columbia's voyage 218 miles above Earth is the 38th shuttle
mission and the first one in five years devoted entirely to
scientific research. The mission was supposed to be in March 1986,
but was delayed by the Challenger accident and then shuttle fuel
leaks.

   Critical senators want Secretary of State
James A. Baker III to promise Congress a role in any decision to
attack Iraqi troops and to pledge more time for economic sanctions
to push Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait.
   Baker, appearing today before the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, was unlikely to satisfy all their demands, although he
has promised close consultation with Congress. The secretary also
is a strong supporter of the economic curbs approved by the United
Nations Security Council after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   But Baker has challenged the view that the Bush administration
would need congressional approval to attack Iraq under the Security
Council resolution approved last week that sets a Jan. 15 deadline
for Iraq to pull out of Kuwait.
   And Baker's spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, said Tuesday,
``there has always been a question, not only in the U.S.

economic sanctions alone convince Saddam Hussein to abide by what

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Some top congressional Democrats say that if
war breaks out in the Persian Gulf, lawmakers should consider an
income tax surcharge to raise the tens of billions of dollars the
fighting likely would cost.
   The idea - similar to the surtax that helped finance the Vietnam
war - drew a negative response from one White House official and a
mostly skeptical reaction from several Republican congressional
leaders Tuesday.
   Nonetheless, some Democrats say a war against Iraq would be so
expensive that it would be a blow to the weakening economy if the
government was forced to borrow the money.
   ``War is a very expensive proposition,'' said Senate Budget
Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn., who was among the first
to publicly discuss the idea. ``If we go into a war, we have to
find some way to pay for it, not to shove these costs onto future
generations by borrowing.''

   New York state is laying off 10,000 workers. Los Angeles has
stopped hiring new police officers even though street crime is
getting worse. Maryland halted a program that buys medicine for the
poor.
   Across the nation, state and local officials are making tough
choices. Squeezed by falling revenue, they are balancing the books
the hard way, by cutting back on what government can do.
   ``I guarantee you we won't be able to care for as many foster
children, mentally ill and so forth as we did last year of the year
before,'' said Roger Wilson, a state senator from Missouri, which
faces a projected $70 million shortfall.
   At least 26 states face deficits or budget shortfalls this
fiscal year. Nearly all have made spending cuts and face more as
the economy worsens.

   Women are twice as likely as men to experience
depression, but a task force of the American Psychological
Association said the reason for this difference is not just
biology.
   Patterns of thinking, physical and sexual abuse, poverty and
unhappy marriages are all woven into a complex tapestry that puts
women at double the risk for depression, said a report released
today by the APA.
   A three-year study by a committee of experts organized by the
APA found that at least 7 million American women suffer from
depression and that most will go untreated, often with ``tragic,
unnecessary losses'' such as suicide.
   ``Women truly are more depressed than men primarily due to their
experience of being female in our contemporary culture,'' Ellen
McGrath, chairwoman of the National Task Force on Women and
Depression, said in a statement prepared for a news conference
today.

   ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) - A new study found 91 percent of nonsmokers
were regularly exposed to high levels of cigarette smoke,
suggesting that the Environmental Protection Agency has
underestimated the risk of passive smoking, a researcher says.
   Dr. Michael Cummings of the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in
Buffalo, N.Y., also said childhood exposure to parents' cigarette
smoke could be a greater risk than an adult nonsmoker's exposure to
a spouse's or colleague's smoke.
   If that is correct, lung cancer could be about to increase among
nonsmokers of the baby boom generation, a result of their parents'
widespread adoption of smoking after World War II, Cummings said.
   He presented his findings Tuesday at a meeting of an EPA panel
considering the merits of the agency's draft passive smoking study
that concludes that cigarette smoke is a known cause of cancer in
nonsmokers.

   A thief can steal more money with a computer
than with a gun and a terrorist can spread more chaos with a
keyboard than with a bomb, experts said today.
   ``We are at risk,'' the National Research Council said in a
300-page report. ``Increasingly, America depends on computers. They
control power delivery, communications, aviation and financial
services.
   ``They are used to store vital information, from medical records
to business plans to criminal records. Although we trust them, they
are vulnerable.''
   The report, titled ``Computers at Risk,'' calls for a coherent
national effort to develop security systems and increase public
awareness of the dangers posed by vulnerable computers to accidents
and deliberate attack.

   ROMULUS, Mich. (AP) - A DC-9 pilot complained he was lost in the
fog moments before his plane collided with another jetliner,
killing eight people, according to a transcript obtained by NBC.
   Federal investigators, while refusing to confirm the precise
conversation between the pilot and an air traffic controller, said
Tuesday the DC-9 crew had trouble finding its way just before
Monday's collision at the Detroit airport.
   Also, Northwest Airlines reported the captain was making his
first flight without another pilot observing since his return last
week from a five-year medical leave, and the plane's first officer
had joined the airline just last March.
   Twenty-four people were injured, two critically, in the fiery
collision between the DC-9 and a Boeing 727, both operated by
Northwest. The 727 was rolling down a foggy runway toward takeoff
when the DC-9 pulled in front of it.

   It took Suzanne Mubarak a year after her
husband became president to decide what kind of first lady she
wanted to be. Then she accepted the challenge of an American
professor and went into the slums.
   For eight years, she has worked among her country's teeming poor
to bring education and hope to impoverished children. Mrs. Mubarak
describes herself as a ``hands-on social worker.''
   She has done the job largely without fanfare, opening schools
and small libraries, obtaining medical supplies and hospitals for
those without them. Much of her attention is focused on eradicating
illiteracy, which afflicts more than half the 55 million Egyptians.
   ``I go to the most depressed area, the most depressed school,
the most depressed hospital, but I don't get depressed,'' she said.
``When I see what's been done, the smiles of the children ... If
you can solve the worst case, surely the rest will follow.''
   Mrs. Mubarak calls her slum projects ``self-help.'' People who
are inspired to help themselves ``are filled with pride and go on
from there,'' she said. ``You don't feel like keeping a place clean
if its walls are falling in.''
   Seated on the lawn of Aruba Palace, a presidential guest house,
she spoke of her goals for Egypt and her life as first lady, wife
and mother of two grown sons. Politics was the only subject
declared off limits for her first lengthy interview since 1985.
   ``People say I'm shy, but I don't think so,'' she said. ``I
would say I'm just a bit timid.''
   To the outside world, and most Egyptians, Mrs. Mubarak is a
mystery.
   She is not a daily fixture in Cairo's government newspapers. Her
activities seldom were mentioned at all until the late 1980s,
reportedly because she and her husband, President Hosni Mubarak,
wanted it that way.
   The president was said to be anxious that his wife not arouse
resentment among the conservative Egyptians as the flamboyant Jihan
Sadat had done. Still, Mrs. Mubarak often is compared with her
predecessor, whose husband Anwar Sadat's assassination Oct. 6,
1981, elevated Mubarak from vice president.
   They have addressed many of the same problems, relating to the
state of women, education, overpopulation and poverty.
   ``We're both Egyptians, so if we do things differently, it's a
matter of style,'' Mrs. Mubarak said. ``The problems we've tried to
solve are still with us.
   ``I can't work in big crowds, in the limelight,'' she said.
``When I cut a ribbon at a school, I've been there 20 times before,
improving the building, buying the books, training the teachers,
talking with the children and visiting parents in their homes. It's
a project I created with the help of private donations.''
   Jihan Sadat was known as an advocate of women's rights in a
male-dominated region.
   In Mrs. Mubarak's view, ``At the moment there are enough laws on
the books of Egypt that give women equal rights, but women have to
know how to use them. It's a social and educational challenge.''
   When her husband became president, she said, ``it took me one
full year to find in myself what was right for me as first lady.''
   Born Suzanne Thabet, daughter of an Egyptian doctor and a Welsh
nurse, sje was 17 when she married Capt. Hosni Mubarak, an air
force flight instructor.
   ``He was so handsome,'' said Mrs. Mubarak, now 49. ``He still
is.''
   For 10 years, she kept to the traditional role of housewife and
mother to sons Alaa and Gamal.
   ``It was very difficult, because there were so many wars,'' she
said. ``My husband was always gone. I gave my life to the boys.''
   The day came when both were in school, and Mrs. Mubarak asked
herself, ``What do I do now?'' Relatives and friends counseled
cooking or sewing classes, but ``I hate those things.''
   She enrolled in American University in Cairo. In 1977, when her
husband was vice president, she graduated in political science with
a minor in psychology. He was president in 1982 when she earned a
master's in sociology.
   Mrs. Mubarak said a classroon experience changed her life.
   ``We had this moody American psychology professor, who was
working with children in the Bulaq slums of Cairo,'' she said.
``One day, he came in and lashed out at us. He said he bet we'd
never been in Bulaq to see how conditions are for children, that we
only passed by in our Mercedeses.''
   After class, Mrs. Mubarak visited him. ``I said if he felt this
way, why didn't he show us how to help the children?'' she said.
``He told me, `Go and find your own way.'
   ``I took it as a challenge, and I did.''
   She asked officials for a list of the five worst schools in
Bulaq, then led a small group of women to each. She chose the worst
of the worst for herself, and wrote her master's thesis on how a
self-help program improved it and could do the same for others.
   The first lady and her women volunteers now care for ``45
schools, and counting. But I've moved on to include children's
libraries, hospitals, handicapped centers, everything you can
name.''
   Some of Egypt's problems are so huge that one person cannot
solve them, she said, but being first lady lets her try and rewards
her when she succeeds.
   There is a darker side to the job: ``No privacy, no place to
unwind. You don't live your own life.
   ``It's a big price you pay.''

<HEAD>Argentina Asks Illegals To Become Citizens</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By OSCAR J. SERRAT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is telling the
estimated 1 million illegal aliens in Argentina they can become
citizens simply by owning up and filling out the proper forms.
   ``The policy of this government ... aims at integration, not
expulsion,'' said Teodoro Funes, undersecretary for institutional
affairs in the Interior Ministry.
   ``We can't take our Latin American brothers to the border and
expel them,'' he added. ``What we're looking to do is regularize
the situation.''
   Unofficial estimates citing government, business and community
sources say the illegals include 340,000 Paraguayans, 300,000
Uruguayans, 250,000 Chileans and large groups of Bolivians, South
Koreans and Taiwanese. Argentina's population is about 33 million.
   Interior Minister Julio Mera Figueroa caused a furor in July by
saying the government might expel illegal residents.
   The government backed off when neighboring countries complained,
but the issuing of visas to Asian immigrants was suspended. South
Koreans and others were said to be using Argentina as a way station
to the United States and Canada.
   ``What happens is, the majority of Asian immigrants don't want
to stay in Argentina,'' an immigration official said, on condition
of anonymity. ``They want our passports so they can try to enter
the United States, Canada and other countries more easily.''
   Diplomats at the South Korean and U.S. consulates declined
comment.
   Carlos Martinez, director of the National Bureau of Immigration,
said the government is not sure how many illegal aliens live in
Argentina.
   ``Unlike other countries that demand that tourists have proof of
economic resources and return travel tickets, Argentina
automatically grants permission for residence up to 30 days to
whoever asks for a visa,'' he said. ``After the fact, it is very
difficult to verify whether these people left or stayed.''
   More than 150,000 illegal aliens became citizens six years ago
under a special arrangement, most of them from Brazil and other
neighboring countries. A similar program was conducted in 1974.
   Argentina has been a traditional refuge for people fleeing
poverty and political repression.
   Thousands of Chileans and Uruguayans entered Argentina after
military coups in their countries in 1973. Bolivians and
Paraguayans seek jobs in Argentina they cannot find at home.
   Citizenship requirements are simple in Argentina, the world's
eighth largest country in area and relatively underpopulated.
Anyone who can prove he has lived here for two years may apply for
a national identity card and passport. There is no quota.
   But many illegal immigrants lack such necessary documents as
birth certificates, marriage licenses or police certifications of
good conduct and can't afford to obtain them, Martinez said.
   He said the documents are available for as little as $20 each
through the appropriate consulate, but that could mean several
hundred dollars for a large family.
   About 300,000 illegal immigrants began the citizenship
application process, but dropped out, most of them for lack of
money, Martinez said.
   He said the government is urging illegal residents to change
their status, because they might be victimized by employers or
become burdens on the state.
   Without national identity cards, for example, workers cannot
require employers to contribute to retirement and health programs.
Martinez said some workers without legal status must accept wages
lower than those specified in labor contracts.
   He said the government will ask the governments of neighboring
countries to provide the necessary documents to their citizens who
apply for Argentine identity cards and passports.
   Argentina might be willing to suspend customs duties on imports
from those countries, provided the uncollected duties were used to
resolve the illegal alien problem, he said.

   Scientists call it the Ratzelfratzel Effect. A
viewer can't figure how to program his videocassette recorder. He
finally jumps up and down on the remote control, screaming
``RATZELFRATZEL, RATZELFRATZEL!''
   But VCR Plus&plus;, although another infra-red remote control device
in a world now full of them, could largely eliminate this.
   With the device, all you have to do is to punch in a coded
number, called a PlusCode, corresponding to the show you want
taped.
   ``What it basically does is allow you to program your VCR in one
step,'' said Louise J. Wannier, vice president of marketing for
Gemstar Development Corp. of Pasadena, Calif., which makes VCR
Plus&plus;.
   The hand-held machine, which costs $60 and went on the market
last month, can simultaneously program both cable boxes and
videocassette players, or just the videcassette player, if you
don't have cable.
   ``There's nothing like it out now,'' said Stephen A. Booth,
editor-in-chief of Video Review magazine.
   There is a wee hitch, though.
   Although the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times and
newspapers in 10 other key markets, including Dallas, Detroit and
San Francisco, now carry the PlusCode program numbers in their TV
listings, it won't be a national operation until next summer,
Wannier said.
   And not all programs are coded, she added: ``It depends on the
publication. It's their option. The only thing that we have
required is that they cover prime time, plus the major categories
of programs.''
   The new goodie could prove a boon for computer-dense viewers
(surveys by teen-agers find 99.6 percent of all adults in that
category).
   In the cable-equipped homes that account for 59 percent of the
nation's TV households, the computer-dense now must attempt two
things: programming the cable box to turn on a given show at a
given hour, and then the VCR to tape it.
   They usually wind up with an hour of The Weather Channel instead
of, oh, say yet another absolutely key episode of ``Twin Peaks.''
This usually touches off a display of the Ratzelfratzel Effect.
   With the new machine, though, you just leave the cable box on.
   Then, ``all you'll have to do is punch in the (program) number
and VCR Plus&plus; will operate your equipment - the whole shooting
match,'' Wannier said.
   As with every new TV equipment arrival, not all goes smoothly on
the first try. For starters, the small daughter of a new VCR Plus&plus;
purchaser yowled when he turned off Bugs Bunny recently to program
his new toy.
   And even though the instructions were written for the
computer-dense, the purchaser, too, yowled when his taping efforts
yielded The Weather Channel instead of football. A similar misfire
occurred later.
   The company's 800 help-line, which operates only on weekdays,
was busy, busy, busy. But a call to Wannier and a little
experimentation fixed things.
   Gemstar has shipped ``many thousands of units'' to key retail
stores and the DAK's and Sharper Image direct-mail companies,
Wannier said.
   She declined to say how many have been sold so far, but ``it's
already sold out in many place,'' re-stocking is under way, and
``we've had more than 1,500 calls a day from all over the country''
since the machine hit the market, she said.
   It's the first product released by Gemstar, founded in 1986 by
Henry C. Yuen and Daniel Kwoh, two scientists with doctorates from
the California Institute of Technology.
   The company expects to have its new video device reaching about
25 percent of the nation's 93.1 million TV households by
mid-December, and to be fully national by early summer, Wannier
said.
   However, in the opinion of Video View editor Booth, it's ``going
to need TV Guide magazine to really make it work, because that's
the big one'' among publications needed to carry the new system's
coded numbers.
   The PlusCodes now appear only in the Chicago and Denver editions
of the magazine.
   ``We have no plans beyond those cities at this point,'' said
Roger Youman, TV Guide's editor. ``We wanted to get some experience
with it and see how it goes. ... It's a new product and we want to
see what happens with it.
   ``It's clear that there are millions of people out there with
VCR trouble ... looking for a quick fix,'' he said. ``This is a
cleverly designed device, and I think it has possibility.''
   Youman called the new machine ``the best idea I've seen so far.
But whether they'll get people to buy it is another question.''

   A premier contemporary art collection,
largely out of public view since twice being attacked by vandals
five years ago, is back on display in a new, more secure location.
   ``It's just great to see people looking at them again,'' said
Dennis Anderson, curator of the Empire State Plaza art collection.
   The two dozen paintings used to hang in the busy main walkway of
the plaza, a huge state office complex adjacent to the state
Capitol. Their new home is in an underground lobby of the Health
Department's headquarters. More than a dozen sculptures in the
plaza art collection are going on display in another lobby area of
the same building.
   Officials say the lobbies will be locked from dusk till dawn and
are easier for police to monitor than the quarter-mile-long main
concourse, where the artworks were previously.
   The collection includes works by Franz Kline, Helen
Frankenthaler, Robert Motherwell, Mark Rothko, Adolf Gottlieb and
other mainstays of the New York School of abstract expressionist
painting. Five sculptures by David Smith that have been outside on
the plaza for two decades have been moved inside.
   A 1952 painting by Jackson Pollock, titled ``No. 12,'' joins the
collection for the first time. It was damaged in a 1962 fire at the
governor's mansion and had hung for years, its paint blistered and
peeling, in the office of the manager of the office complex.
   The Pollock work and the 20 damaged by vandals were
paintstakingly restored at the Williamstown Regional Art
Conservation Laboratory in Williamstown, Mass.
   Anderson declined to put a value on the collection. But in 1987,
the chairman of the commission that oversees the art, Barnabus
McHenry, estimated its worth at more than $20 million.
   The works were purchased by New York state for about $2.5
million between 1966 and 1973. The pieces were selected by then
Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller and other experts to adorn the
granite-lined walkways and modernistic, cavernous courtyards of
Rockefeller's grandiose office complex.
   Keeping art safe from vandals and thieves is a worry for
curators everywhere.
   ``There has been a rash of stolen works of art and of
vandalism,'' said Mimi Gaudieri, executive director of the
Association of Art Museum Directors in New York City. ``I think all
museums in the country have improved their security measures.
They've hired more guards and put in better electronic equipment.''
   In the most recent major instance of vandalism, two people
shouting anti-imperialist slogans mutilated paintings by Roy
Lichtenstein and James Rosenquist at the International Contemporary
Art Fair in Paris on Oct. 27. The works had an estimated value of
$1.35 million. A small painting by Philippe Favier was stolen from
the same exhibit.
   Anderson and other experts said artwork available for public
viewing is at risk of being damaged or pilfered, whether the works
are on display in government buildings, corporate headquarters or
private museums.
   ``Security breaches happen in museums and they certainly have
guards in nearly every room,'' Anderson said. ``Short of locking
them (artworks) away from the public, which would be the ultimate
kind of security, we have to deal in stages or variables of
security.''
   Thomas Tubbs, a spokesman for the state Office of General
Services, estimates more than 1 mllion people, including the
15,000 state employees who work in the complex, see the plaza
artwork each year.
   But workers and tourists are not the only ones who gravitate to
the plaza.
   Until authorities cracked down a few years ago, dozens of
homeless people congregated nightly in the parking garages and
maintenance areas beneath the plaza or on the complex's concourse
level, especially during the winter.
   In 1985, a mentally disturbed man who believed he was getting
orders from outer space scribbled messages in French and English on
a dozen plaza paintings. A few months later, another disturbed man
slashed and wrote religious slogans with a felt-tip marker on eight
more pieces of art.
   Of the pieces not damaged by vandals, many displayed the bruises
of being displayed in a public building, conservators say. The
artwork was a frequent target of school children's spitballs. Hand
prints and shoe marks had to periodically be cleaned off the few
wall-size pieces in the collection.
   In 1987, a $10,000 tapestry disappeared without a trace from a
plaza wall. It has never been recovered.
   In its new location, the artwork is surrounded by electronic
sensors and wire railings extending four feet from the walls. If a
person's arm or foot approaches a canvas, an alarm will sound.
Cameras will allow police to watch those watching the art.
   The pieces that were made for specific sites on the concourse,
measuring 50 feet or more long, will remain there, with electronic
sensors and camera surveillance for protection.

   Over breakfast, Nick Davis and Brooks Hansen tried
to decide whether Eton Arthur Boone was more famous than Andy
Warhol.
   ``He may have been about as well known as Andy Warhol,'' said
Hansen.
   Davis disagreed. ``Oh, I think less well known,'' he said.
   Who was Boone? Actor, painter, stand-up comedian, '60s icon .. .
   And a work of fiction.
   Hansen and Davis ought to know that better than anyone, since
they collaborated to create the title character of their novel,
``Boone'' (Summit Books, $19.95), which is played out in the New
York art and performance world of the 1960s.
   But during an interview, they scattered references to Boone
naturally through their conversation, as if he was an old and very
real friend.
   Take the comment from Davis, describing his own new career as an
actor with an improvisational group in New York: ``Every time I
come off (stage), I think: `My God, Boone was good. I can't fill
Boone's shoes.'''
   While their friendship with Boone is imaginary, their
acquaintance with each other dates back to childhood. The two were
born a month apart in New York in 1965. Their families were
friends, and they vacationed together growing up. Both Davis and
Hansen attended Harvard University, where they began working on
Boone.
   Although the two are now working separately, they still talk and
act like a writing team straight out of a Hollywood movie -
finishing each others' sentences, picking up on each others' ideas
and jokes. Their looks and styles complement each other. Hansen is
blond and bespectacled, and speaks deliberately, while Davis is
dark haired and athletic.
   Hansen and Davis' familiarity with New York's art scene is
something they came by naturally. Davis' grandfather was a
screenwriter, his late mother was an author, and his father is the
documentary film maker Peter Davis, who directed ``Hearts and
Minds,'' the film about the Vietnam War. Hansen's mother is an
artist and his father is a television executive.
   Their novel is structured around fictional recollections of
characters who ``knew'' Boone.
   To help develop the wide variety of characters in the book,
Davis and Hansen asked student actors to play different people in
the work. They gave their fellow students a hint about the
characters they were supposed to play, then took them to a
farmhouse in Connecticut and watched the results.
   ``The more time we spent with those characters, the more we
understood them,'' Davis said.
   But the improvisational skits didn't offer enough. ``We realized
it wasn't becoming a very good book,'' said Hansen. ``It was flat
and long.''
   The pair abandoned the book their senior year, and picked it up
again in the summer of 1987, after graduation. They finally hit on
the solution to Boone's character while watching Sammy Davis Jr. on
television. They suddenly realized Boone's great talent was going
to be performing monologues in which he would not only assume the
identity of a celebrity, but delve into that person's soul.
   That's when they realized their central character had a dark
side - ``that Boone was mean,'' Davis said.
   Hansen described himself as ``more the litigator for the plot.''
Davis, he said, was a ``more positive, accepting reader.''
   Hansen is now working on a second novel by himself, and Davis is
acting in New York.
   For now, they have no collaborative efforts in the works. ``For
the sake of yourself, you've got to show you can do it yourself,''
Hansen said.

<HEAD>Madonna in 3-D - Sound, That Is</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY McSHANE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Madonna's already done it; Sting's about to join
her. Coming soon: Paula Abdul and Janet Jackson.
   Is it Broadway? A movie? World tour?
   It's QSound, a new recording technology that turns an ordinary
set of stereo speakers into a kind of 3-D sound system, according
to its developers. Madonna just released the first album using the
system, while the rest are working with it now.
   ``You'll hear things in the songs you've never heard before,''
promises Shep Pettibone, who mixed Madonna's ``Immaculate
Collection'' greatest hits package. ``The whole idea is to make
stereo more stereo, to sound even better.''
   Basically, the system enhances the stereo effect that makes
sounds appear to be projected from their source instead of coming
from the speaker. A computer with a special software program is
attached to regular production equipment during mixing to create
the effect.
   There are just six of the QSound recording systems in the world:
one in New York, one in Europe, two in Los Angeles and two in
Canada. Pettibone - with frequent visits from Madonna - worked on
the one in Manhattan.
   The result: congas popping in from your right ear, synths from
your left ear, Madonna's vocals coming in and out from either side
- all of it several feet from your speakers.
   ``Finally, something that compares with the little sounds in my
head,'' said Madonna after hearing the results.
   It's a long way from the first demo developed to promote the
project: thunder claps and a growling bear that ``sounded like a
sick moose,'' said Lawrence Ryckman, president and chief executive
officer of Archer Communications Icc., which is a partner with
QSound's inventors.
   ``It was quite embarassing, but it worked,'' Ryckman said of
those early days.
   Rocker Julian Lennon, who's planning a QSound recording,
recalled his first exposure to the technology as less than
inspirational: ``I heard it about a year ago when - to put it
politely - it wasn't very good ... It's gotten better with time.''
   QSound was conceived in 1980 by co-inventors Dan Lowe and John
Lees. The project was put off by financial difficulties for several
years until Lowe met with Ryckman in late 1985.
   Ryckman was convinced Lowe had something; after several years of
raising money and industry interest, they finally brought QSound to
the fore in the past 18 months. In addition to music, QSound will
be used in the 1991 generation of Nintendo games, Ryckman said.
   The artists who have sampled QSound are uniformly enthusiastic.
Madonna's collection went on sale Nov. 13; it is already rising on
the charts.
   The process could add to the cost of a tape or CD, because,
Ryckman said, QSound will get a royalty on each record sold just as
singers and bands do, adding to record companies' costs. However,
Madonna's ``Immaculate Collection'' is regularly priced.
   Lennon became a QSound convert after hearing a demo of the new
Sting album, ``The Soul Cages.'' He is now writing his next album
in anticipation of using the system for the whole thing.
   ``The mix I heard for Sting's new album blew me away totally,''
he said. ``After that, I said, `This is for me.' It's an extra
dimension. I always believed there was more out there, and we've
found something.''
   Singer Freddie Jackson giggled giddily when he took a break from
using QSound to mix his new single, ``Do Me Again.''
   ``I heard the system, heard the quality, and I was floored by
it,'' he said. ``I want the music to sound like it's live on stage.
That's the exciting thing - it's like live. I think everyone is
going to be floored by the sound.''
   Hugh Padgham, who produced the new Sting album, was more over
the top: ``QSound will do to stereo what stereo did for mono.''
   So does this mean QSound is the wave of the future? Those who've
used it say for certain things, yes; for other things, no.
   ``The main concern I have is it loses the drive of the song,''
said Goh Gotoda, the engineer on Jackson's single. ``For certain
things, it's very nice - Freddy's vocals, for example, it gives a
three-dimensional feel. But the rhythm section, no. You want to
keep that as tight as possible.''
   Pettibone agreed there are limitations: ``I think it would work
great for albums. For 12-inch singles, I don't see it as necessary
... The only place I don't see it working at all is classical.''

<HEAD>More Parallels Between Vietnam and the Gulf</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Militarily, President Bush pledges, the
Persian Gulf crisis will not become another Vietnam. But
politically, there is no such assurance.
   Instead, there are parallels, 25 years apart, between the first
stirring of congressional skepticism about Vietnam and the current
hearings on U.S. policy against Iraq.
   It is not just an institutional debate about the powers of
Congress and those of the president; behind it is the question of
national support for Bush's course if it leads American forces into
war against Iraq.
   ``More than any other decision in a democracy, the decision to
go to war demands popular understanding and popular assent,''
historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. said. It is a lesson his
colleagues in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations learned in
bitter Vietnam experience.
   As the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees
heard testimony on the Persian Gulf confrontation, questions and
sometimes answers echoed those of a generation ago, when the
Vietnam buildup was beginning.
   When the possibility of a declaration of war in Vietnam was
raised in 1965, the Johnson administration said no, on grounds that
it could trigger a chain reaction in the communist bloc and widen
what was then a limited war.
   Now that U.S. forces in the gulf face the possibility of
conflict after a Jan. 15 United Nations deadline, Secretary of
Defense Dick Cheney dealt with the same issue this week in much the
same way.
   ``The notion of a declaration of war, to some extent, flies in
the face of what we're trying to accomplish here,'' he said, which
is to try to force Iraq to get out of Kuwait as an international
venture, under United Nations auspices.
   ``I'm not sure why you would want to have the United States go
out unilaterally on its own and turn this into an Iraq-U.S. war,''
Cheney said.
   ``Well because, Mr. Secretary, that's what the Constitution
provides,'' Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., retorted, saying that
if it comes to combat, the fighting will be Americans vs. Iraqis.
   At the beginning of the Vietnam conflict, there was little
political or public dissent about the declared administration goal
of helping the south defend against communist aggression from the
north. The antiwar movement took shape slowly as he conflict
escalated into the longest of America's wars.
   But there were early notes of caution and skepticism at hearings
before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in the winter of
1966. Robert S. McNamara, the secretary of defense, declined to
appear there, saying it would not be in the public interest for him
to discuss Vietnam policy in open session.
   This time McNamara, the Vietnam hawk, testified on the side of
caution. He told the Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday that
the United States should wait for economic sanctions to work
against Iraq. ``Who can doubt that a year of blockade will be
cheaper than a week of war,'' he said.
   The Senate hearings began 10 days ago, before the Armed Services
Committee. Cheney was invited to lead off, but the administration
decided against an appearance until after the United Nations
Security Council had approved the possible use of force to drive
Iraq from Kuwait.
   That left the initial proceedings to former officials and
retired military men who generally counseled caution, questioned
the wisdom of Bush's plan to more than double U.S. troop levels,
and said the United States should wait for U.N. economic sanctions
to force Iraqi withdrawal.
   Countering them on Monday, Cheney said he believes Saddam
Hussein can ride out the sanctions. That would leave a military
offensive as the only way to drive him from Kuwait unless he leaves
peacefully.
   That prompted Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, to observe that Cheney's
statements were ``almost a rebuttal of current policy'' which was
built around the embargo. Cheney denied that.
   But the delay in his appearance did put him in the position of
answering critics instead of stating a case for them to rebut.
``From the administration standpoint, they probably made a
mistake,'' said Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn.
   While Bush said he welcomed the Senate hearings, he hardly
sounded enthusiastic. ``They're talking right now,'' he said last
Friday. ``They're having endless hearings by endless experts up
there.''
   Bush said he knew there were fears of another Vietnam. ``Let me
assure you, should military action be required, this will not be
another Vietnam,'' he said. ``This will not be a protracted,
drawn-out war.''
   He said U.S. troops will be backed to the hilt and ``there will
not be any murky ending.''
   But at the hearings, Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., said he'd
been to the White House as a Senate leader in the Vietnam era, and
heard overly optimistic estimates of the military outlook there.
   ``History is littered with the bones of optimists and soldiers
who thought that they were headed for a short war,'' said Sen.
William S. Cohen, R-Maine.

   When they check up on the state of their
finances in these recessionary times, many people are paying
especially close attention to their disaster-preparedness plans.
   It is no cheerful business to contemplate in detail what could
happen to your pocketbook should calamity strike.
   But financial advisers say you can wind up saving a lot of money
and misery if you keep watch for early-warning signs of trouble and
have some advance idea, however sketchy, of how to react to it.
   ``Financial trouble gets out of control sooner than most people
expect,'' says John Reed in his newsletter Real Estate Investor's
Monthly.
   ``That's because there is a slippery slope to debt. The debtor
is in big trouble when he thinks trouble is still far off.''
   Many precautionary measures are part of the routine job of money
management - maintaining insurance coverage, for example, and
saving to store up a reserve of ready cash.
   Still, authorities on the subject say, there may be many
additional benefits to running through the budgetary equivalent of
a fire drill before the temperature gets uncomfortably hot.
   ``Debt problems can happen to anyone, at any time,'' cautions
the American Financial Services Association, a lenders' trade
group. ``Unforeseen medical expenses, a temporary job layoff, a
marital breakup all can play havoc on the most stable of budgets.
   ``For others, mismanagement of their personal finances can lead
to serious trouble in a short period of time. The problems can be
compounded by how people face a budget-buster crisis.''
   One common pitfall, advisers say, is to ignore or deny the
existence of a problem in its early stages.
   ``As soon as it looks like a payment might be missed, creditors
should be contacted,'' says the American Bankers Association in a
current bulletin on the subject.
   ``They may be able to assist by refinancing, extending payment
periods, or consolidating loans. Delaying may only make matters
worse.''
   A second source of potential danger can be overly optimistic
calculations or assumptions about the cushion of assets on which
your finances rest.
   If you have to liquidate stocks, mutual funds or other
fluctuating assets during a spell of economic trouble, you may have
to sell them at distress prices.
   That same hazard can apply to the biggest asset in many people's
hands - a house or other real estate property, especially ow when
real estate markets in many areas of the country are depressed.
   If you have to move, or need to sell a house just to raise cash,
the proceeds may be greatly diminished by capital gains taxes on
any profit you realize above your cost basis of the property.
   The law allows home sellers to put off paying these taxes if
they buy another home of equal or greater value within two years.
``But if you are in financial difficulty, you probably cannot buy
the requisite home,'' Reed points out.
   The deeper into trouble real-estate investors get, he adds, the
more extra costs they may incur, including such possibilities as
lawyer's fees, late penalties on debt payments, and even
mortgage-prepayment penalties.
   Reed's advice for real-estate owners, which might well apply to
many other people as well: ``Do an if-we-lose-control balance
sheet.''
   ``List assets at their net-liquidation-sale values and add the
additional liabilities which would be triggered by defaults,
prepayments and taxes,'' he says. ``If the lose-control balance
sheet shows a zero or negative number, you'd better steer well
clear of losing control.
   ``Furthermore, take immediate action to improve your
lose-control balance sheet.''

   It is difficult to convince someone whose house
has been on the market for a year at progressively lower prices
that, yes, there is still a market out there.
   Potential buyers are out there, say demographers, those folks
who analyze population statistics and make projections from them.
And when the mix of economic elements is right, they say, those
buyers may spring into action.
   The explanation lies in a further examination of the baby boom
generation that followed World War II, which some marketing people
assume has by now made most of its biggest purchases, such as cars
and homes.
   But, others now say, some of that bulge of youngsters hasn't
completed its purchases, especially homes.
   The initial impact of boomers had explosive results for housing.
In 1976, the total value of existing homes sold was $96.6 billion.
Four years later, the value was $245.7 billion.
   Glenn E. Crellin, an economist with the National Association of
Realtors, has traced the trail left since then as the boomers
worked their way through the economy.
   The boomers were hurt by the two recessions in the first three
years of the 1980s, but then came back strongly. Despite the
recessions, more than 30.3 million units were sold in the decade,
11 percent more than in the 1970s.
   Prices rose even more. The median leaped from $55,700 in 1979 to
$93,100 in 1989, and in many areas the appreciation was at a rate
of 20 percent a year for a few years. Some houses tripled in price,
some even quadrupled.
   A consequence of this was that some baby boomers were priced out
of the market, but not permanently. Some still wait for the proper
times: lower interest rates, lower prices and a better economic
outlook.
   That's one part of the potential market, but still another tends
to be overlooked.
   In its entirely, the baby boom era lasted almost two decades,
from 1946 to 1964, but as Crellin points out, it came in two
distinctly different waves.
   In the first, which lasted 10 years from 1946 to 1955, births
jumped from about 2.9 million a year to more than 4 million. As
that part of the boom worked it ways through the economy it was
easily traced and highly publicized.
   The second wave, which lasted nine years, was not as dramatic.
The number of births no longer rose, but it seldom fell either.
Births plateaued at a very high level, between 4.1 million and 4.3
million a year.
   Years later the two waves had this effect on housing:
   The first produced a sudden rise in household formation, which
often can be equated with housing demand. It was very, very
noticeable. The second produced no sudden demand, but it maintained
demand at an extremely high level.
   Some of that potential demand had not been satisfied when
various economic factors combined to throw housing into a downturn.
Some baby boomers had not even come of buying age, roughly 26 years
to 44 years.
   Thus, some of the older boomers, deprived of home ownership by
the economic downturn, may become buyers when times improve. And
the youngest of them will be entering the home-buying age group for
the first time.
   It leads Crellin to the conclusion that ``an enormous pent up
demand from these households for owner-occupied housing still
exists.'' The message to those seeking to sell, therefore, is this:
Have faith, and more patience.

   The highest judicial body of the United Methodist
Church has ruled it is up to the church's governing general
conference to decide if a new worship book can substitute the
phrase ``Creator, Redeemer and Sustainer'' for ``Father, Son and
Holy Spirit.''
   The ruling on that and other language alterations by the
church's Judicial Council came after the previous 1988 general
conference adopted five different, partly inconsistent resolutions
about language dealing with the deity.
   Four of the resolutions supported traditional terminology, and
the fifth rejected ``all efforts to legislate specific addresses to
God'' in worship and liturgy. The church's Board of Discipleship,
which is developing a new worship book, asked the high court to
resolve the apparent conflict.
   The general conference of the 9 million-member denomination
meets next in 1992 in Louisville, Ky.

   CHICAGO (AP) - A personnel committee of the Evangelical Lutheran
Church in America reports that a larger percentage of men than
women on its staff have salaries in the higher ranges.
   While the number of white males making more than $40,000 a year
is larger than for women, the percentage of black and Hispanic
executives who make more than $40,000 is larger than for either
white males or females, the committee says.

   WAYNE, Pa. (AP) - The Catholic News Service has introduced a
non-denominational telephone service for reviewing movies. Named
the Preview Line, callers to 1-900-773-8439 receive reviews of
currently showing movies at a cost of $1.50 for the first minute
and 75 cents for each extra minute.
   Thomas N. Lorsung, director of the news service, said the
service was developed in response to parental concerns about values
being expressed in motion pictures.

   The observance, promoted by the Freedom, Justice and Peace
Society based here and endorsed by leaders of various world

   NEW YORK (AP) - Traditional customs and ceremonies are being
revived in Reform Judaism that had once largely abandoned them, a
survey found.
   A commission for the Union of American Hebrew Congregations and
its rabbinical organization, the Central Conference of American
Rabbis, reported these findings:
   - Yarmulkes (skullcaps) are provided at 59 percent of the
congregations.
   - Nearly all the reporting congregations kindle the Sabbath
candles before Friday evening services.
   - Blessings are recited before and after reading from the Torah
(Biblical books) at Sabbath morning services at 87 percent of the
congregations, and more than half report marching with the Torah
held aloft.
   - Like Orthodox and Conservative congregations, two days of Rosh
Hashana are observed by 35 percent of the Reform congregations.
   Rabbi Sanford Seltzer, director of the survey commission, said
the trend ``is not a return to Orthodoxy, but rather the
expressions of a post-Holocaust generation of Reform Jews seeking
new dimensions of spirituality.''

   Chef Edna Lewis has gained a national reputation
simply for cooking the way everybody used to - by tinkering and
tasting - before cooking became opening cans, adding water to mixes
and tearing open microwave packaging.
   Sure, chefs everywhere now insist on the freshest local
ingredients and many specialize in regional cuisine, but while
these culinary academy-trained cooks race from fad to fad (remember
baby vegetables? remember quiche?), Lewis has spent most of her 74
years steadily building a repertoire of Southern dishes best
described as high home cooking.
   Readers of Lewis' three cookbooks, ``The Edna Lewis Cookbook,''
``The Taste of Country Cooking,'' and ``In Pursuit of Flavor,''
know her devotion to seeking out the old varieties of fruits and
vegetables, cooking by the seasons and keeping preparations simple.
   Lewis invoked these themes again and again in a recent interview
that began at a farmers' market in Manhattan's Union Square, where
she often buys produce for Gage &amp; Tollner, the landmark Brooklyn
restaurant where she has worked since 1988.
   Lewis grew up in Freetown, Va., a small community settled by
freed slaves. ``I grew up on the farm. ... Everyone was
self-sufficient,'' she said in her slow and soft manner of
speaking. ``Each family had a garden. In the spring you planted
corn and in the fall you gathered in the crop and during the winter
you shelled your corn and took it to the mill and they ground it up
and you took it home the same day.
   ``So when we were shelling the corn, we knew it was going to be
made into our cornmeal. When we brought it home from the mill, we
would taste it, to see what this corn tasted like that we grew and
shucked and shelled ourselves. ... Sometimes we couldn't take it to
the water mill and had to take it to the mill that ran by motor,
and we would taste it afterwards and say, `Oh, it tastes of the
motor.' So we were all involved not so much in the cooking but in
the taste of things.''
   Such intimate contact with food has given Lewis an exquisitely
sensitive palate. She can tell the difference between a chicken
stock that has boiled and one that has barely simmered; she can
taste a quickbrea  and tell if double-acting baking powder was
used. The word ``taste'' pops up everywhere in her speech and in
her cookbooks.
   Standing next to a tomato vendor in the market, for example, she
explains why she doesn't switch from fresh to canned tomatoes when
summer's over, as many cooks do: ``I can taste the can.''
   Lewis, who is entirely self-taught as a chef, came to New York
before World War II and fell in with a group of friends who took
turns cooking for the others.
   As she tells it, one of them, John Nicholson, said, ``Edna, one
day I'm going to open a restaurant and you're going to cook for
it.'' He did, and Lewis became chef at Cafe Nicholson in the late
'40s. The restaurant attracted Tennessee Williams, Truman Capote
and others hankering for real Southern cooking.
   She later worked at restaurants in North and South Carolina and
ran a pheasant farm in New Jersey before returning to New York to
cater and do other restaurant work. Her second cookbook, ``The
Taste of Country Cooking,'' published in 1976, established her as
an authority on the subject.
   In 1988, restaurateur Peter Aschkenasy bought Gage &amp; Tollner, a
fading dowager of a restaurant, renovated it, and brought in Lewis
to revitalize the menu. She introduced country ham, pan-fried
quail, corn pudding and spareribs at the 111-year-old seafood and
chop house, and the crowds started returning.
   Alice Waters, of Chez Panisse restaurant in Berkeley, Calif.,
called Lewis ``ageless and tireless'' in her pursuit of the pure
flavors from her past - watercress as peppery as the wild cress she
used to pick by streams, country ham as mellow as the hams that
came from her brother's hogs, buttermilk that hasn't lost its
richness from processing.
   ``I don't think all chefs have her ability, her desire to taste
and taste and taste again, to recognize that these peaches don't
taste as good as last year's because they were picked too soon,
this constant evaluation of everything as it comes,'' Waters said.
   Lewis is a tall, regal woman who favors African print dresses
and tends to answer questions with circuitous stories.
   She was interrupted at least a half-dozen times by well-wishers
who recognized her.
   ``We're two transplanted Virginians who love your books,'' said
one man, accompanied by his wife. ``I just want to tell you we were
in Smithfield recently and they told us they don't feed peanuts to
the hogs anymore.''
   She told the man she would be traveling soon to Smithfield, Va.,
famous for its country ham. ``I want to talk to Gwaltney (Co.). I
think they have the best ham, but they're not as good as they used
to be.''
   After the interview moved to a McDonald's - the only restaurant
in the area found to be open at the early hour - Lewis said she is
working on a new cookbook on traditional Southern cooking. People
still eat that way at home, she said, but it's increasingly
difficult to find that style of cooking in restaurants.
   ``I guess people want to taste outside cooking - Japanese,
Italian, whatever,'' she said.

   When the switch is thrown Wednesday on the
Capitol Christmas tree, it won't be just another lighting to the
folks of Walden, Colo. For four years, Walden has planned so that
one of its trees would be the centerpiece of the holiday season,
America's Christmas Tree.

   Through 28 presidents and half the country's history, it
survived. Sprouting from a single seed, it grew as the nation did,
from a few scented needles to a 74-foot sentry of the forest. When
they cut it down just before Thanksgiving, the evergreen revealed a
magnificent trunk girdled by 136 rings.
   And now, because a handful of people in a depressed logging town
believed they could do it, this noble Englemann spruce has emerged
from deep woods near Walden, Colo., to make its way, by truck and
train, to the front lawn of the U.S. Capitol.
   America's Christmas tree is ready to light up the season
Wednesday. This year's Capitol tree found its way from the
Colorado-Wyoming border to the country's front yard because Pat
Bunge, proprietress of Pat's Hair Hut, and retired school teacher
Mary Rupp, and U.S. Forest Service specialist Carolyn Krupp, and
Chris Christofferson, owner of the North Park Cleaners and Laundry,
and other civic bosters had an idea four years ago.
   They wanted to do something special to celebrate Walden's
centennial in 1990.
   Many in the town of 800 people looked around, and what they saw
were trees - millions of them. Trees carpeted hillsides, made the
air smell good, built their houses, fed their fireplaces and wood
stoves through long, frigid winters, and most importantly, kept
their faltering economy alive.
   Like most other Americans, the folks of Walden had watched
Christmas tree lighting ceremonies on television. They were
confused between the White House Christmas tree and the Capitol
tree. So they investigated, and learned that the White House
version is a living tree that is redecorated every year.
   The Capitol tree, however, is always a freshly cut evergreen
from a national forest and no public funds ever are used to
transport or decorate it, truly making it a ``people's tree.''
   So in the late winter of 1987, a few folks in Walden decided
they wanted the 1.1 million-acre Routt National Forest that
encircles the town to donate the Capitol tree in 1990.
   Christofferson, then a town councilman, recalled that nobody had
thought about celebrating the centennial before a local forest
service official noted the 100th anniversary was fast approaching.
   ``But we got right on it, and sent a letter back to Washington
to the head of the forest service, petitioning for the honor,''
said Christofferson. ``We were competing with four other
communities, and with the help of our congressional delegation, we
got picked. ... Then we went to work.''
   Walden's Capitol Christmas Tree Committee met monthly. It
commissioned a logo, mailed fliers to every school district in the
state soliciting waterproof, fireproof decorations for the tree.
   The committee brainstormed ways to raise more money in a town
that long had been used to making do instead of making new. Its
members were a cross section of the community - teachers,
businessmen, state officials, foresters, a retired postman, even
the school superintendent. It was grassroots, and it was effective.
Volunteers eventually raised nearly $10,000.
   Corporate sponsors were solicited. Union Pacific Railroad agreed
to transport the tree to Washington; Louisiana Pacific donated
trucks and cranes to get the tree from the forest to the train, and
then move it from a rail siding in Washington to the Capitol.
Anheuser-Busch even pledged its famous Clydesdales to lead the
town's Christmas parade and give the tree a grand send-off.
   Boosters designed and sold souvenir mugs, hats and T-shirts to
pay for cutting and wrapping the tree. More than 100 people,
including at least 35 kids, signed up to go to Washington for the
ceremony. Bake sales and car washes helped finance their expenses.
   Before you could say ``Tannenbaum,'' the whole community was
united in Christmas tree mania.
   But despite all the hubbub, Waldenites hung on to the original
goal: find their best tree and give it to the country. Parents took
their youngsters for weekend walks, scouring the back country for
pretty trees. The committee offered a $50 prize. Snowmobilers
ventured far back in the wilderness in winter, hoping heavy snow
would help them find that one perfect evergreen.
   Foresters kept a confidential list of candidates and, by last
July, nine trees were deemed suitable to show Paul Pinkus,
landscape architect of the Capitol, when he arrived in Walden.
   ``It took us two days to look at all of them because they were
spread out all over the county, but he finally picked the
next-to-last tree he saw,'' Christofferson said.
   Pinkus supervises 84 employees who manicure the Capitol grounds,
and he knows a good, sturdy Christmas treewhen he sees it.
America's Christmas tree must have ``good color, be very full and
yet compact, and be at least 50 feet tall and 25 feet in
diameter,'' said Pinkus, 63, who has chosen the tree for 27 years.
   A week before the tree-cutting ceremony kicked off Walden's own
Christmas season, the National Association of Counties delivered a
morale blow by calling the town one of the 10 most ``endangered
communities'' in the West.
   But that was old news to Walden citizens, who've been going
through tough times so long even old-timers can't remember the boom
years. They weren't about to let the obvious ruin their party.
   So, on Nov. 11, a crowd of 500 bundled-up well-wishers applauded
with their mittens, sang carols and cheered on 75-year-old
tree-cutting expert Casimier Wojakowski of Bark River, Mich., as he
choreographed the felling of the chosen tree.
   With hand signals to loggers and intuitive skill, Wojakowski
supervised the ceremony. In just a few minutes a 4-ton behemoth was
gently lowered to the snow-sprinkled ground.
   Christofferson will be in Washington when House Speaker Tom
Foley, D-Wash., throws the switch and sets Walden's tree aglow.
Some 4,000 lights, clear, amber and blue, and 6,000 handmade
ornaments from Colorado schoolchildren will set the tree
a-twinkling.
   And Walden will realize its dream.
   ``It's the biggest thing that's ever happened to us,''
Christofferson said. ``We've really put Walden on the map.''

<HEAD>Revolution Can't Change Geography and Economics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Europe generally turned its
back on the Soviet Union after the region's Communist rulers bowed
to popular revolt a year ago, but trade and geography make the huge
neighbor impossible to ignore.
   New governments must balance the lingering emotion of revolution
with economic and political reality.
   They rejoice over the departure of Soviet soldiers and the
Warsaw Pact's impending demise, but warily watch the floundering
giant that supplies most of their oil and much of the electricity,
natural gas and timber, and buys their mediocre consumer goods.
   Some East Europeans wonder whether they are trading one form of
domination for another.
   ``It is well known that Hungary's energy supplies are largely
based on Soviet raw materials,'' Laszlo Lengyel, an economist and
political scientist, wrote in the Hungarian labor daily Nepszava.
``There is no need for tanks to maintain their influence in the
region.''
   Anger and distrust toward the Soviet Union are evident among
ordinary people throughout the region.
   In Bulgaria, once the Kremlin's closest ally in the Soviet bloc,
only 30 percent of those polled favored close ties with Moscow and
75 percent were against celebrating Nov. 7, the Soviet Union's
Revolution Day.
   In countries where the study of Russian was required for
generations, hardly anyone seems to understand it. People are
learning English and German instead.
   Statues of Lenin have come down and places named for Soviet
heroes and their local cohorts have been rechristened.
   Andras Hegedues of Hungary, the only living signer of the Warsaw
Pact, feels Eastern Europeans always must keep their powerful
neighbor in mind.
   Even if the Soviet Union disintegrates, Russia, its largest
republic, ``will remain a military power,'' he said.
   Richard Sumann, director of Czechoslovakia's Foreign Investment
Agency, said: ``We must prepare for a situation where the Soviet
republics are independent, or more independent.''
   Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania border the Soviet
Union. Bulgaria is tied to the eastern Slavs by language and
custom.
   The Soviet Union says the close ties of four decades were forged
by more than Soviet military might.
   ``Eastern Europe is Eastern Europe, and it will exist as Eastern
Europe forever,'' said Oleg A. Grinevsky, the Soviet delegate to
talks on reducing conventional weapons in Europe. ``We have
historic, economic, and political ties, and it is impossible to
exclude them from everyday life.''
   In addition to most of its oil, Hungary gets about one-third of
its electricity from the Soviet Union. Other Eastern European
countries are equally dependent on the Soviets, with little
opportunity to change.
   Cheap and reliable energy supplies are disappearing along with
Soviet political domination. Beginning in 1991, the Soviets will
demand the market price in dollars for oil delivered to East
European countries instead of the much lower prices by complex
agreements within the Comecon economic alliance.
   Several former Soviet bloc nations sought oil supplies from
Iraq, then the Persian Gulf crisis tightened supplies and drove
prices up. Eastern European countries have pledged to obey the U.N.
sanctions on Iraq.
   Soviet oil supplies to Czechoslovakia this year will be at least
18 million barrels short of the 116 million promised. Poland is
expected to get only 70 million barrels, nearly 20 million less
than expected.
   Hungary and Romania have reeived less electricity from the
Soviet Union than anticipated.
   The Soviet economy is in such chaos that Moscow could not even
promise supplies of chemicals, coal, timber, cellulose, paper
products and consumer goods, said Laszlo Timar, who oversees
Hungary's trade with the Soviet Union.
   ``Their problems and troubles are very big, and we cannot rely
on these problems being solved in a short period,'' Timar said.
   Germany is replacing the Soviet Union as Hungary's main trade
partner, but the Soviets are not likely to fall below second or
third, he said.
   That is a matter of geography. According to Timar, when Hungary
and the others begin paying the world price for Soviet oil, the
Soviets probably will prefer them as customers because pipelines
exist to deliver it.
   When Hungary imposed stiff gasoline price increases in October,
taxi drivers and truckers blocked roads for a weekend, virtually
shutting down the country. The government struck a deal with the
protesters after threatening police or military action.
   Hegedues, who was premier of Hungary at the time of the 1956
uprising against Stalinism, said he felt ``civil war was in the
air'' during the price protests.
   Gasoline price increases in Czechoslovakia set off two rounds of
hoarding this year.
   Czechoslovak officials used looser rules within the Soviet Union
to augment their oil supply. They cut through the Moscow
bureaucracy to swap trucks, buses, bulldozers, cranes and consumer
goods for 3.5 million barrels of oil from the Tyumen region of
Siberia.
   Timar said Hungary was close to an agreement to trade its Ikarus
buses for oil.
   The Soviet Union is a huge, hungry market for machinery,
manufactured items and consumer goods produced in Eastern Europe.
Beginning Jan. 1, that trade also will be conducted primarily in
hard currency.
   Many of the products cannot be sold in the West, but East
European countries need to earn convertible currency from them.
   Timar estimated Hungary will lose 20 to 40 percent of its Soviet
business next year, including half of its machinery market, because
Soviet customers will be freer to buy from the West.
   He predicted Hungary will remain a major supplier to the Soviet
Union because ``our products are well known there. We think that
slowly, slowly, our exports will be increased, but they will be
tragically cut back for the time being.''
   Even though Hungarians look west, business will draw them east,
he said: ``There is more personal interest in the West now, but to
make money they will travel to Moscow.''

<HEAD>Thousands of Peruvian Babies Available for Adoption</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ALEX EMERY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Phillip Thomas Shaffer, 4 months old, wriggled
in his new mother's arms, an appealing grin on his face.
   He is unaware of the human drama unfolding around him as his
mother, Terry, battles court officials and the bureaucracy to adopt
him.
   Foreigners, most of them from the United States, are coming to
Peru in growing numbers to adopt infants, despite sometimes
nightmarish problems. Light-skinned foreigners with Indian babies
are a common sight in Lima.
   ``Couples wait for years in the United States,'' said an
American lawyer who specializes in adoptions in Lima. ``Peru is
faster.''
   Abortions, family planning and a more organized welfare system
in the United States turn adoptions into a five-year process. Most
adoptions also involve older children.
   During an interview in the American lawyer's office, the
telephone rang every few minutes with calls from new clients.
Peru's appeal has soared since other countries, such as Colombia,
made adoptions more difficult.
   Phillip is one of thousands of babies offered for adoption by
poor, single Peruvian mothers who are unable to feed or educate
them.
   This poverty-stricken Andean nation of 22 million, mired in its
worst economic crisis, has discovered it has something many people
in other countries want: babies.
   Cuanto, an economics magazine, observed tongue-in-cheek that
Peru could pay its $20 billion foreign debt by selling 1.3 million
babies for adoption abroad.
   Newspapers and television stations, noting the growing presence
of foreign couples, have begun dedicating more space to baby
trafficking scandals.
   They reported that an unmarried woman in Lima tried to sell her
three children to an Italian couple for $10,000, but the father
halted the deal.
   Another woman, who left her 6-month-old daughter with a friend
for several weeks, said in a television interview the friend handed
the baby over to a European couple.
   Foreign couples, who begin caring for the babies before they are
awarded custody, frequently find themselves caught up in
complicated legal proceedings. Critics attribute some lengthy
adoption cases to court officials seeking bribes.
   The American lawyer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the process is sometimes slowed by ``a sense of national shame that
the country can't support its own children.''
   Terry Shaffer, 30 and single, left her home in Ellicott City,
Md., four months ago to adopt a child in Peru. Since then, she has
lost her job as an epidemiologist and is being supported by her
parents.
   Her adopted child, Phillip, is from Ayacucho, a remote
mountainous region ravaged by a leftist insurgency.
   Ms. Shaffer had to face formidable paperwork before the adoption
process even began: documents certifying her birth and mental and
physical health; copies of her passport and tax returns; letters of
reference and employment, even FBI assurance that she had no
criminal record.
   All of it had be translated into Spanish and notarized.
   ``I gave in everything, but the case took so long we got bogged
down, so the judge threw the case out and we started all over
again,'' Ms. Shaffer said.
   Linda Carey of Laurel, Md., had an easier time.
   Ms. Carey, in her 40s and single, took two months to do the
paperwork. She now has her 5-month-old daughter, Johanna Elizabeth,
from a poor family in Peru's rural north.
   Before a child can be taken to the United States, consular
officials in Peru examine the papers to make sure the adoption is
legal.
   The American lawyer said a successful adoption in Peru depends
on the right combination of judge, lawyer and biological mother.
   ``Well picked, they can make the adoption a happy, loving
experience,'' he said. ``Badly chosen, they can make it the most
emotionally distressing experience you've ever had in your life.''
   He said lawyers' fees for adoption cases average $6,000-$9,000.
   ``A lot of that goes on wining and dining the judge and bringing
the natural mother to Lima, all medical expenses paid,'' he said.
   Two years ago, American missionaries Ed and Pam Baumgartner, who
have lived in Peru eight years, took in four battered children from
a broken home in Pucallpa, a jungle town.
   When the children, of four different fathers, said they wanted
to stay with the Americans, the Baumgartners applied for adoption.
That was nine months ago.
   ``What delayed things is that we refused to bribe a single
official,'' Mrs. Baumgartner said. ``Now the fathers are
threatening to show up. I'm dreading that. They're going to want
money.''

<HEAD>In a War, Ur Becomes a Target</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If war comes to Iraq, it also comes to what's
below the surface there: the civilizations of Mesopotamia, the
cities of Babylon and Ur, ancient places where humanity learned to
write, to raise wheat and barley, domesticate animals and live in
cities.
   But archaeologists are surprisingly sanguine about the safety of
artifacts buried under the sands in Iraq's vast desert.
   Thousands of unexcavated sites and millions of clay tablets
whose writings have yet to be interpreted will survive, even if
Iraq and Kuwait turn into a battleground, these scientists say.
   ``Obviously, if war comes, there will be unexpected damage, but
I don't think it will be calamitous with regard to archaeological
sites'' except those near modern cities or other potential targets,
said Robert McC. Adams, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution
and an eminent archaeologist known for his years of research in
Mesopotamia's ruins.
   Among the potential targets, however, is the city of Ur, built
on the banks of the Euphrates at the dawn of history and said to be
the birthplace of Abraham, the biblical patriarch.
   What sits atop of Ur now is a major Iraqi airfield, almost
certain to be targeted in a war.
   And the fabled city of Babylon, dating back to 3000 B.C., is
just north of modern Hilla, an industrial city. A stray bomb
intended for Hilla could shatter Babylonian artifacts.
   Like most sites in Iraq, these two retain their secrets despite
150 years of research. Only a fraction of what is to be found has
been uncovered, Adams said.
   ``We probably have some knowledge, other than having walked over
the surface, of less than 1 percent, and it may be one-tenth of 1
percent, of the existing sites,'' he said. ``I myself must have
mapped 5,000 mounds or something in that neighborhood.
   ``So the treasures there to be unearthed over thousands of years
to come are enormous.''
   The prospect of war - and of Islamic hostility to Westerners -
raises doubts about the future of work in Jordan, Syria and
elsewhere in the region. The Iran-Iraq war and the Iranian
revolution of the Ayatollah Khomeini halted research in Iran.
   The threat of war raises greater concern about the safety of
antiquities stored in such places as the ``spectacular'' museum in
Baghdad, according to archaeologist Elizabeth Stone of the State
University of New York at Stony Brook.
   ``A direct hit would be catastrophic,'' she said.
   Stone is optimistic, however. She noted that on three occasions
during the Iran-Iraq war, when it seemed likely that Baghdad would
be bombed, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had priceless objects
moved out of harm's way.
   Saddam - who sometimes portrays himself as a latter-day
Nebuchadnezzar, the 6th century B.C. Babylonian ruler - is well
aware of the value of antiquities in ``fostering a time-depth in
the consciousness of the people,'' said Guy Van Beek, a Smithsonian
archaeologist who has worked in the Mideast for nearly three
decades.
   Van Beek said Saddam has been ``extraordinarily active'' in
encouraging excavations ``even given all his problems with war with
Iran.''
   ``It is always possible that a pitched battle can take place on
a site'' or that a general can decide an excavation would be a good
place from which to stage an ambush, he said.
   But short of those quirky events, he said, most archaeological
sites are far from cities or targets and unlikely to be in danger
of wartime destruction. The vast majority are 30, 40 or 50 feet
below the surface.
   Peacetime economic development - the flooding of a valley or
damming of a river - is generally more destructive to archaeology
than war, Van Beek said.
   And in wartime, he said, random bombing is likely to be less
destructive than the loss or looting of equipment and records and
the destruction of artifacts that already have been brought to the
surface.
   War, of course, brings the frustration of disrupting work that
may have finally begun to pay off after decades of digging.
Archaeologists sometimes wait in vain for decades to return to a
former worksite rather than starting anew elsewhere, he said.
   When Saddam seized Kuwait Aug. 2, no Western archaeologists were
known to have been stranded. Work had stopped during the hot
summer.
   Before the invasion, Stone was able to put in only three seasons
of work at the ``lost city'' of Mashkan-shapir which she and
colleagues discovered in Iraq. Some 3,700 years ago, she said, it
was ``one of the world's 10 most important cities.''
   Now she has no idea when she will be able to resume digging.
   ``We were just beginning to get a real understanding of the way
in which those cities worked,'' she said.

<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Having won control of Southern Baptist national operations,
fundamentalist forces are concentrating on holding state and local
organizations in line, and seem largely to be succeeding.
   Resistance has come from some quarters, notably denominational
colleges.
   But as the autumn chain of annual state conventions unfolded,
potential revolts against the denomination's ``Cooperative
Program'' for financing national agencies mostly failed to
materialize.
   State allocations to the national budgets remained generally
intact, or increased in some cases, with only three states
modifying their pattern of support, two of them only slightly.
   The 14.9 million-member denomination, the country's largest
Protestant body, has churches in all 50 states, some with joint
regional conventions.
   Basic national budgets for the various evangelistic, missionary
and educational agencies amount to $137 million, but supplementary
revenues push the total to about $400 million.
   Leaders of moderates, pushed to the sidelines of denominational
management through appointive powers of successively elected
fundamentalist presidents, met in August and initiated plans for
selective giving.
   Such alternatives also were sanctioned by the big Women's
Missionary Union.
   But just one state convention, Virginia, radically curtailed
giving to the central budget, cutting its part by half, and
designating the other half to approved causes, mainly missions.
   Special allocations also went to the Baptist Joint Committee on
Public Affairs, a Washington-based, inter-Baptist agency virtually
stripped from denominational support, and also to a newly formed
news service.
   The service, Associated Baptist Press, was set up this fall
after national officers fired top journalists of the denominational
agency, Baptist Press.
   The Maryland-Delaware convention also provided direct financing
to the Joint Committee on Public Affairs, but otherwise continued
its regular giving pattern to the headquarters budget.
   Similar but unsuccessful efforts to finance the committee were
made in New England, Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky and Hawaii. In
North Carolina, an alternative finance plan like Virginia's was
narrowly defeated.
   However, individual congregations still may participate in
alternative finance arrangements. How many of the denomination's
37,785 congregations will do so remains uncertain.
   Several of the state conventions drew unusually large turnouts
as the conflict shifted to that level. Strains emerged over
relationships with some Baptist colleges.
   They apparently sought to stave off the kind of new restrictions
that already have struck at national levels, including the
denomination's main seminary in Louisville, Ky., where exacting
views of the Bible were made guidelines for evaluating professors.
   The guidelines demand various specific beliefs, such as that
Adam and Eve were real people and that recounted miracles happened
as events in history.
   Differing from the national supervision of agencies and
seminaries, more than 50 Baptist colleges come under oversight of
state conventions.
   Citing fear of a ``fundamentalist takeover,'' the largest
Baptist college, Baylor University in Waco, Texas, and Furman
University in Greenville, S.C., have made their trustees
self-perpetuating. They previously were named by state conventions.
   Both cases produced convention controversy, study committees and
hints of lawsuits.
   In Florida, Stetson University also moved to distance itself
from the state convention through a negotiated arrangement. In
Oklahoma, the convention acted to reinforce ties with Oklahoma
Baptist University in Shawnee.
   In the denomination's upper echelons, repercussions of the
fundamenalist ascendancy also continued.
   Disciplinary action was taken against the Rev. Lee Porter of the
Nashville, Tenn., headquarters, who was accused of making
``critical interpretations'' about the 12-year controversy in which
fundamentalists have gained dominant power.
   He was removed as design editor of adult Sunday school lesson
materials and assigned to a non-editorial position, although he
wrote a letter of apology to the administration about his
unspecified comments.
   Porter also reportedly was being pressured to give up his post
as convention registration secretary, a post he has held since 1977
and to which he was re-elected last June.
   A catalyzing center of the fundamentalist upsurge, the
denomination's largest church, First Baptist in Dallas, elected a
new fundamentalist-backing pastor, the Rev. Joel Gregory, to
succeed the Rev. W.A. Criswell.
   Calling himself a ``defender of the inerrancy of the word of
God,'' Gregory told reporters after his selection last week, ``I
was country before country was cool.''
   Criswell, 81, who has headed the 27,000-member downtown
congregation for the past 46 years, will become senior pastor, a
largely honorary position, on Jan. 6.
   Gregory, who for five years has been pastor of Travis Avenue
Baptist Church in Fort Worth, also was named speaker on the
``Baptist Hour,'' a nationally distributed Southern Baptist radio
program. It marks its 50th anniversary of broadcasting in 1991.

<HEAD>Starry, Starry Night: The Popularity of Vincent van Gogh</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOLORES BARCLAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Arts Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vincent van Gogh's creative compulsions brought
little financial or emotional solace to the troubled Dutch
impressionist during his lifetime. But 100 years later, he is
unarguably the world's most popular painter.
   He enjoyed considerable acclaim among his fellow artists during
the late-1800s, and his influence was felt long after his death in
1890. However, experts disagree whether he sold only one work or
three or more during his life. Today, though, his works fetch
astronomical and record prices at art auctions around the world.
   A four-month extravaganza earlier this year in The Netherlands
commemorated the centennial of the painter's death with about 380
paintings and drawings on show at the Vincent van Gogh Museum in
Amsterdam and the Kroeller-Mueller Museum in Otterlo, and a film
festival and opera.
   Now comes Robert Altman's passionate portrait of the artist in
Hemdale Film's ``Vincent and Theo.'' It is a thoughtful, inspired
explosion of the emotions, fears and genius of the man who once
said that ``work distracts me infinitely better than anything
else.''
   Tim Roth (``A World Apart,'' ``The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and
Her Lover'') gives an intensely intelligent portrayal of the
artist. He rides the emotions well without slipping into
caricature. Paul Rhys (``Litte Dorrit,'' ``Lion Heart'') co-stars
Theo.
   It is the not the first time the film world has tackled the
complex life and personality of van Gogh.
   Altman's is a psychological vignette, rather than a full-fleshed
cinemagraphic biography, focusing on the special relationship the
artist had with his brother, Theo, an art dealer who nurtured
Vincent all his life. It is quite unlike Vincente Minnelli's
sprawling but inaccurate 1956 vision, ``Lust for Life,'' with Kirk
Douglas as van Gogh and Anthony Quinn as his one-time lover,
colleague and friend, Paul Gauguin.
   Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa also captures van Gogh in the
``Crows'' segment of his movie ``Akira Kurosawa's Dreams.'' It is a
tribute to the artist, who is portrayed by American director Martin
Scorsese.
   ``Dreams'' has eight segments and the central character
throughout is called ``I.'' In ``Crows,'' I is a grown man, a young
photographer looking at some of van Gogh's work. He eventually
finds himself in an open field with the artist, who proclaims,
``all of nature has its own beauty'' as he furiously fills page
after page.
   Van Gogh's most prolific period was 1888-89 when he painted
about 200 oils and did 100 drawings. From this passionate frenzy
emerged some of the most popular art works ever, van Gogh's
vibrantly colored sunflowers, fishing boats and pastoral scenes.
   During that same period in Provence, he wrote about 200 letters
to his brother, his sister, Gauguin and other artists.
   In a letter to Theo on April 9, 1888, he talks about one of his
favorite orchards on the outskirts of Arles, one he ultimately used
for a painting:
   ``I have another orchard, as good as the pink peach trees,
apricot trees of a very pale pink. At the moment I am working on
some plum trees; yellowish-white, with thousands of black branches.
I am using a tremendous lot of colours and canvases, but all the
same I hope it isn't a waste of money. ...''
   Van Gogh was born on March 30, 1853, in the southern Netherlands
village of Zundert. Life was a continual nightmare of poverty,
loneliness and periodic bouts of madness until he ended it after
firing a rifle into his chest on July 29, 1890.
   He rode an emotional rollercoaster between and during his
prolific outpouring of art. After he mutilated himself by cutting
off his right ear, he turned evangelical, saying the Bible had
ordered him to remove the ``ofending organ.''
   On May 8, 1889, van Gogh went to the asylum of
Saint-Paul-de-Mausole in Saint-Remy-de-Provence, a few miles north
of Arles. The doctor there wrote in the medical register that van
Gogh was suffering from ``acute mania with hallucinations of sight
and hearing. ...''
   The first canvas van Gogh did at Saint-Remy was ``Irises,'' a
dancing field of brilliant, violet flowers and a single white one.
``Irises'' set a record when Sotheby's sold it for $53.90 million
on Nov. 11, 1987. The painting subsequently was sold to the Getty
Museum in Malibu, Calif., after Australian tycoon Alan Bond could
not repay a loan Sotheby's had posted for the sale.
   The most expensive painting ever was van Gogh's ``Portrait of
Dr. Gachet,'' which sold this year for $82.5 million. The painting
in vivid blues and intense orange, was of the artist's friend, a
doctor who practiced homeopathic medicine.
   But it was ``The Starry Night'' that emerged as a cult favorite,
inspiring a song from pop artist Don McLean.
   ``The sky is blue-green, the water is royal blue, the soil is
mauve,'' van Gogh said in a letter to Theo describing the painting.
``On the blue-green field of the sky the Great Bear, sparkling
green and pink, a reflection whose modest shine contrasts with the
powerful gold of the gas light.''

   Armed with healthy skepticism of
the praise being heaped upon him, actor Tim Roth is as rare and
refreshing a presence in Southern California as is clean air.
   The irreverent Roth, who plays a fiery Vincent van Gogh in
Robert Altman's ``Vincent and Theo,'' is dressed in a T-shirt that
proclaims him ``Well Red.'' He recounts how he was thrown out of a
bar at his New York hotel because he was improperly dressed, and
how he needed to borrow a suit for an East Coast screening of
``Vincent and Theo.''
   ``He's got a rich swagger, doesn't he?'' the 29-year-old British
actor says as another movieland power player wanders by the pool at
the Sunset Marquis hotel. When a small plane flies overhead, he
remarks, ``Oh look. They're bringing the drugs in.''
   Although the skinny, sandy-haired Roth doesn't much look like
van Gogh, ``he became the character,'' Altman said.
   ``He's as good a film actor as I've ever worked with,'' said
Altman, who has directed Warren Beatty, Robert Duvall, Keith
Carradine and Tom Conti, among others.
   Roth shares top billing, too, in Tom Stoppard's film adaptation
of his play ``Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead.'' A
grand-prize winner at the Venice Film Festival, ``Rosencrantz''
premieres early next year.
   While he's not without an ego (Altman says Roth can be difficult
on the set) Roth is uncomfortable accepting praise for his work.
Although he wants to be a part of the American film scene, he's
hardly in awe of the local industry or himself.
   ``It gets silly,'' the lightly freckled actor said. ``I'm
compared to (Al) Pacino and (Dustin) Hoffman. What does it mean? I
just think it's safe journalism.
   ``I treat it all with a large bucket of salt. There's no
guarantee of any of this. You come here and people treat you with
kid gloves, very nicely. And then they forget about you because the
next person is in town. It's a cutthroat business, and has nothing
to do with art at all.''
   Art, at least, has much to do with ``Vincent and Theo.'' The
intense film chronicles the emotional interdependence of the Dutch
artist and his younger brother, Theo (Paul Rhys), an art dealer.
   Roth's Vincent has caked and rotten teeth, filthy hands and a
mind that's equally polluted. He jams his pipe into his mouth as
though he's burying a fence post, and paints and sketches with
similar abandon.
   Although everybody knows something about Vincent van Gogh - no
ear lobe, liked sunflowers, had a beard - Roth says the artist's
life is mysterious, and there's not much point doing a lot of
research, either.
   ``I read his letters and looked at the paintings. That's it,''
said Roth, a former art student himself.
   ``There are thousands of books you could read, but they're all
written by academics and intellectuals. It's a tricky one. Everyone
wants him to have been mad. And I don't know that he really was.
Would you lock him up today? What would be the attitude today? Tell
him not to be naughty and put him on welfare? Take away his
government funding?''
   As an actor, Roth has had his share of rejection, but obviously
far less than van Gogh.
   ``He did believe, and carried on being rejected. And that's the
self-abuse thing: eating paint, drinking turpentine and cutting off
his ear lobe. That's all part of the rejection.
   ``The only thing as an actor that you are aware of - and
certainly not to the extent that he was - is the rejection. You are
aware of being rejected, either when you've done something bad by
the audience or by people who, when you think you can do a part,
say, `No.'''
   Roth's film credits include ``The Cook, the Thief, His Wife &amp;
Her Lover,'' in which he plays a sidekick to a thug, and ``A World
Apart.'' His next film is ``Backsliding,'' an Australian drama
directed by first-timer Simon Target.
   Roth also starred as the transmogrified son in director Steven
Berkoff's London stage production of Franz Kafka's
``Metamorphosis.''
   In working with Altman, who often improvises and puts a lot of
trust in his actors, Roth was free to fashion much of the film
himself.
   ``If we said, `This is the way we want to do it,' Altman says,
`That's how we'll do it,''' Roth said. ``We'd rewrite scenes in the
evening with him or on our own, and then go and present them to
him.
   ``The script was the starting point. ... For example, there's a
scene where I'm cooking with (Paul) Gauguin (Wladimir Yordanoff),
and it was originally a scene where we're sitting around talking
about painting. That's not what painters do with their lives.
   ``That came out when I said, `Let's do a scene where we're all
cooking.' And Wladimir, said, `Oh yeah, I got a great recipe from
my grandmother for salads.' And that was how it came out.''
   Van Gogh, Roth said, was someone who had interested him since he
was in art school. ``He was my father's hero. My father used to
paint and draw and was also a journalist. He had a rough life,
too.''

   Larry Hagman tells Barbara Eden on CBS'
``Dallas'' that she looks familiar - an inside joke for viewers who
saw them 20 years ago on ``I Dream of Jeannie.''
   For five weeks beginning Friday night, the prime-time soap opera
brings them into a fractious relationship as Miss Eden appears in
the role of Leann de la Vega.
   ``Leann's a very sharp businesswoman who took over running an
oil company eight years ago after her husband's death,'' Miss Eden
said. ``She knows J.R. because they went to college together.
   ``I can't say too much about the story. Let's just say that he
wasn't very nice to her in college and their paths cross again in a
business deal. She decides to extract every drop of blood she can
get from him.''
   On ``I Dream of Jeannie,'' Hagman played Tony Nelson, an
astronaut who lands on a desert island when his mission is aborted.
He finds an old bottle. Inside? Jeannie, a genie who'd been in the
bottle for 2,000 years.
   When he set her free, he became her master. The show was on five
years, and at the end the characters married.
   ``That killed the series,'' Miss Eden said. ``I objected to the
marriage because I knew it would hurt the show. It was a fantasy.
It was all smoke. She wasn't real. To marry her was to turn it into
an ordinary sitcom.''
   There also was an animated version on CBS on Saturday mornings
from 1973 to 1975.
   CBS and the producers of ``Dallas'' are hoping the Hagman-Eden
reunion will renew interest in the show, which has been doing only
so-so in the ratings in recent years. On the strength of the ``Who
shot J.R.?'' phenomenon a decade ago, ``Dallas'' became a runaway
hit and had remained at the top for several years.
   Of her character of ``Dallas,'' Miss Eden said, ``This woman is
deadly serious. She's nothing like Jeannie. She makes a plan and
carries it out. J.R. doesn't remember her, which makes it fun.
   ``I had a great time doing this. We didn't need any inside
jokes, but so many of the lines are wonderful. He asks her,
`Haven't we met before?' The first day on the stage, everyone was
watching us. Larry looked at me and said: `Isn't this the strangest
thing? It's like we've never stopped working together.' ''
   It's not their first time together since ``I Dream of Jeannie,''
however. They played husband and wife in a 1971 murder mystery
called ``A Howling in the Woods.''
   In 1985, she starred in the movie ``I Dream of Jeannie ... 15
Years Later.'' Wayne Rogers played Tony, but Bill Daly and Hayden
Rorke reprised their original roles.
   If ``Dallas'' returns for another season, Miss Eden might be
back for another bout with Hagman. ``Well, at least they didn't
kill me,'' she said.
   Miss Eden starred in the series ``Harper Valley P.T.A.'' in
1981-82, but has spent most of her post-``Jeannie'' time working in
TV movies and regional theater.
   She has her own deal for a series and several movies, and has
several series in development, including a comedy and several
one-hour dramas.
   ``Whatever is chosen will be predicated by the needs of the
network,'' she said.
   Miss Eden started work after Thanksgiving on a psychological
thriller movie called ``Smithereens,'' based on a book by B.W.
Battlin.
   ``My husband is murdered and I'm accused of killing him,'' she
said. ``They can't make the charges stick. It's very suspenseful
because the person who killed my husband wants to kill me and my
daughter.
   ``I'm being stalked by Angie Dickinson. The audience knows it,
but I don't. She impersonates me, which is why they think I did
it.''
   Earlier this season, Miss Eden was in the NBC movie ``Running
Mates'' and, next year, will be in ``Naked Ambition,'' a CBS movie
with a plotline that can be compared to ``All About Eve.''
   Miss Eden plays an established anchorwoman who welcomes a
younger newswoman, played by Heather Locklear.
   ``I take this little viper into my heart, and she puts a knife
in my back,'' Miss Eden said. ``She's out to get my job - anybody's
job.''
   Miss Eden also has big news in her personal life: Jan. 5, she
said, she will marry real estate developer Jon Eicholtz.
   ``He took over the remodeling of my house and suddenly
everything started getting done,'' she said.

   It was such a slow news day when he began as the
new president of Cable News Network, Tom Johnson recalls, that
``CNN was televising stories on mules diving into pools of water.''
   That was on Aug. 1, when he reported for duty with a number of
projects in mind. They included an effort to get Bill Moyers, his
White House boss during the Johnson Administration, to move from
PBS to CNN.
   But all that was put on hold the next day, when Iraq invaded
Kuwait. CNN and its rivals scrambled to cover the Persian Gulf
crisis and a possible war.
   A month later, CNN had its own crisis.
   ``We found ourselves no longer simply reporting on budget
deficits, but ... experiencing our own as a result of the massive
expenses of the Gulf crisis coverage and a softening advertising
market,'' Johnson said.
   And last month, there was another crisis, which began when a
federal judge barred CNN from airing tapes of jailhouse phone calls
by ousted Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega.
   Though the Supreme Court refused to hear CNN's argument that the
ban was unconstitutional prior restraint of the press, the judge in
the Noriega case later lifted it.
   ``It was a very busy four months,'' said Johnson, understating
the case.
   It surprised many in the industry when CNN's owner, Ted Turner,
went outside both the company and broadcast news to hire Johnson,
who then was publisher of the Los Angeles Times.
   ``We really wanted someone that had a lot of management
experience and had a good reputation as a strong people-person, as
well as strong journalistic credentials,'' Turner said.
   It was the second time in two years a major network had chosen a
newspaperman to run its news division. In 1988, NBC hired Michael
G. Gartner, then head of the Des Moines Register and Tribune Co.
   How great a transition is it from print to television news?
   ``It totally depends on the person,'' Gartner said. ``I don't
think you can generalize.''
   ``I don't think there's a great deal of difference in terms of
the principles,'' said Moyers, who before working at PBS and CBS
was publisher of Newsday on Long Island, N.Y.
   ``The principles are: Remember you're in the news business, find
the best people and give them a chance to do their work in an
atmosphere of freedom and creativity.''
   But Moyers said his longtime friend ``is really on the front
line now in a way that he wasn't at the Times, because as
publisher, he had a phalanx of people reporting to him. While
that's also true at CNN, he's making, on a daily basis, the kind of
decisions an editor makes every day. ... I think he's now in a job
more like Patton than Eisenhower.''
   ``The intensity of the place surprised me. Perhaps it shouldn't
have,'' said Johnson, who for three years was a top executive in
Lyndon Johnson's Texas broadcast operations but who has spent the
bulk of his career in print journalism.
   CNN was ridiculed by rivals as ``Chicken Noodle News'' when it
began in 1980. No more. It now is an influential, worldwide TV news
organization seen in 100 countries, with President Bush and Iraq's
Saddam Hussein among its better-known viewers.
   Plugged into 57 million U.S. homes and offices by cable, it also
has 227 TV station affiliates who can excerpt CNN stories for their
newscasts.
   Significantly, 130 of the stations also are affiliates of ABC,
CBS or NBC, whose news divisions are caught in the same advertising
and money crunch as CNN and have pink-slipped some employees to cut
costs.
   But there have been no layoffs among CNN's worldwide workforce
of 1,700, Johnson said, and none are planned.
   Despite the cost crunch, CNN ``is very healthy economically,''
he said, although ``the slowdown in advertising and costs of the
Gulf coverage required that I implement a number of holddowns.''
   That included the axing of ``East Meets West,'' a weekly
half-hour series on Asian lifestyles and business customs.
   If the nation's economic slump and the Gulf crisis continues,
``then I probably would need to find other ways to contain costs
while doing that which is essential for CNN to do,'' Johnson said.
   But ``we will provide comprehensive news throughout all of this.
... This is a period of time when I think our audience is more
interested in the news than ever before.''
   The financial crunch has prompted Johnson to temporarily shelve
what he calls ``several initatives,'' or ideas for new programs.
   One is a series similar to ABC's ``Nightline.'' There has been
speculation within CNN that it might evolve from CNN's nightly
``Crisis in the Gulf'' broadcasts, just as ``Nightline'' evolved
from ABC's late-night reports on the Iran hostage crisis in 1979.
   Johnson also would like to start a series about the print and
electronic media.
   And ``I would like to see us expand our international bureaus in
Africa, Central and South America, and Asia, three places where I
feel more coverage would be useful,'' he said. CNN now has 14
foreign bureaus.
   Johnson said he still hopes to land Moyers, whom he first met in
1965 while on a White House Fellowship. He initially served as an
aide to Moyers, then press secretary for President Johnson.
   Moyers said there have no serious discussions about a move to
CNN.
   Shortly before taking charge at the network, Johnson ``just said
if I ever get ready to come back to the news business, let him
know,'' Moyers said. ``I said to Tom that I have commitments here
at PBS that I intend to fulfill ... but someday he and I can sit
down and talk.''
   ``I would like to see Bill do at CNN what he does at public
television,'' Johnson said, referring to Moyers' acclaimed specials
on various topics. ``I also suggested to him a concept I described
as `Around the World With CNN.' ''
   In that, Moyers would interview major players in world events,
among them Saddam Hussein, Soviet president Mikhail S. Gorbachev
and President Bush.
   ``I would love to see him as part of the future of this
network,'' Johnson said. ``But he is currently committed to his PBS
lineup and there are no immediate plans for him to move over -
although I'd be willing to re-open that any day.''

   Late-November sales of cars and trucks made in
North America by the Big Three automakers tumbled 24 percent,
reflecting a continued softening in the auto industry, the
companies said.
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. said
Tuesday they sold an average of 24,387 cars and light trucks a day
during the Nov. 21-30 period this year compared with an average of
32,101 during the same time last year.
   Car sales were down 20.9 percent and truck sales were off 28.3
percent.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Sales of new homes dropped 3.5 percent in
October to the lowest level in eight years, the government
reported, but analysts said the free fall may be bottoming out and
sales should begin rebounding by spring.
   Sales totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 491,000, the
Departments of Commerce and Housing and Urban Development said
Tuesday. That was the lowest since 480,000 new homes were sold in
October 1982, a month before the 1981-82 recession ended.
   ---
   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Federal Reserve has relaxed its reserve
requirements for banks, an unusual move aimed at stimulating the
deteriorating economy by easing a shortage of credit.
   The central bank said Tuesday's action, the first change in
reserve requirements since 1983, was taken in part for technical
reasons but also to encourage banks to increase lending.
   Private economists, however, said the most visible result likely
would be a modest boost in bank earnings at a time of increasing
strain on the industry, rather than as an economic tonic in
general.
   ---
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - An ambitious effort to overhaul the
world trading system appeared on the verge of collapse as pressure
built on European countries to compromise in their fight against
major farm subsidy cuts.
   Some European officials indicated Tuesday they were willing to
offer more agriculture subsidy cuts, although it was uncertain
whether any new offer would be enough to satisfy U.S. negotiators.
   The 12-nation European Community had staunchly resisted a
U.S.-backed proposal to slash export subsidies and reduce internal
support payments and market barriers over the next decade.

   ATLANTA (AP) - Soft drink rivals Coca-Cola and Pepsi Cola made
almost simultaneous announcements that they plan to sell their
products in recycled plastic bottles.
   The cola makers became the latest companies to join the
corporate race to please an increasingly environmentally conscious
market. If approved by the Food and Drug Administration, soft drink

   DAYTON, Ohio (AP) - NCR Corp.'s board of directors scheduled a
meeting to discuss AT&amp;T's latest offer to buy the computer company.
   NCR spokesman Mark Feighery said while the board unanimously
rejected a previous $85-per-share offer from the American Telephone
&amp; Telegraph Co., the latest, $90-a-share proposal has yet to be
formally voted.
   AT&amp;T has said the offer would be on the table until the end of
business Wednesday. The NCR board meeting was set for Wednesday.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. said it was
abandoning the once-lucrative trading of stocks of potential
takeover targets, a business hurt sharply by the end of the 1980s
mergers boom.
   Also on Tuesday, First Boston Corp. confirmed it laid off 55
workers in its fixed-income department as part of a companywide
restructuring designed to slash 200 jobs in the last two months of
the year.
   The moves were further signs of weakness on during a lengthy
recession on Wall Street.

   NEW YORK (AP) - American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., emboldened
by its highly successful foray into the credit card business,
extended the free-for-life membership offer by three months to
attract additional customers.
   The move Tuesday by the telephone giant to increase circulation
of its Universal Card was bound to further rankle banks, which view
AT&amp;T as an invader chipping away at one of their most profitable
areas, credit-card income.
   AT&amp;T launched the Universal Card, a Visa or Mastercard that
doubles as a long-distance calling card, eight months ago.

   NEW YORK (AP) - A federal judge affirmed a U.S. Supreme Court
ruling that ordered the LTV Corp. to re-assume liability for nearly
$3 billion in employee pension plans it stopped funding in 1987.
   The Dallas steel, aerospace and energy concern, which is in
Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, had opposed restoring the
plans because it claimed such a move could possibly force the
company to liquidate.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet oin Tuesday rejected the
company's and creditors' arguments and granted a request by the
federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. to make LTV take back
responsibility for the pension plans.

   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. has given
potential customers another three months to take advantage of a
free-for-life membership in its Universal Card, one of the fastest
growing credit cards.
   The move announced Tuesday by the telephone giant to increase
circulation of the card was bound to further rankle banks, which
view AT&amp;T as an invader chipping away at one of their most
profitable areas, credit-card income.
   Eight months ago, AT&amp;T launched the card, a Visa or Mastercard
that doubles as a long-distance calling card. To attract members,
AT&amp;T said those who signed up by Dec. 31 would never pay an annual
fee for the rest of their lives - as long as they used the card
once a year to buy something.
   Since then, nearly 7 million cards have been issued, making AT&amp;T
one of the biggest forces in the credit-card business. The company
issues its cards through Universal Bank of Columbus, Ga., a
subsidiary of Synovus Financial Corp.
   On Tuesday, AT&amp;T extended the signup deadline until March 26,
1991, the anniversary of the card.
   ``It's a way to allow more people to take advantage of a pretty
good deal,'' said Bruce Reid, a spokesman for the AT&amp;T Universal
Card Services Corp. subsidiary in Jacksonville, Fla. No decision
has been made on what annual fees might be charged after March 26.
   Industry analysts speculated AT&amp;T prolonged the offer simply
because it's been so effective in helping the company muscle in on
the domain of big-bank competitors, which generally charge an
annual fee for cards.
   ``The primary reason for AT&amp;T's enormous success in distribution
is this free-for-life deal,'' said Bruce Brittain, head of Brittain
Associates Inc., a consulting firm in Atlanta that researches
credit-card use.
   ``When you're in the business of getting the card into people's
wallets, until you see that growth curve flatten, why not continue
it?,'' he said.
   Kurt Peters, editor of Credit Card News, a industry publication
in Chicago, said the free-for-life offer has been so successful
that even AT&amp;T has been surprised, and ``they're hesitant to tinker
with success.''
   The card also offers users a 10 percent discount on
long-distance calling card rates as well as the same amenities
pitched by other leading cards, ranging from warranty extensions to
collision insurance. The Universal Card's interest rate on unpaid
balances is 18.9 percent, about the same as other key competitors.
   The banking industry has fiercely opposed AT&amp;T's credit-card
operation and some banks have challenged it on legal grounds,
saying the company has flouted federal regulatory requirements.
AT&amp;T says it's done nothing improper.
   Last Friday, Visa U.S.A., the payment organization of Visa card
issuers, decreed a six-month moratorium on new non-bank applicants
in what was seen as a move to soothe banks unnerved by AT&amp;T's
success. MasterCard, the other leading payment organization,
tightened rules for issuers, making it more expensive.
   ``The banks have spent years and millions of dollars building up
Mastercard and Visa, and now they see this non-bank company come in
and crank up this big credit-card marketing machine,'' Peters said.
   Others said it was premature to judge the ultimate success of
AT&amp;T's effort. If a substantial number of Universal Card users pay
off their balances promptly, for example, they will deprive AT&amp;T of
interest income.
   ``The jury's still out on how profitable it will be,'' said
Gerri Detweiler, an official at the Bankcard Holders of America, a
consumer education group in Herndon, Va.

   The shopping season is racing toward Christmas,
but retailers aren't reporting high-speed sales.
   The faltering economy, concerns about the Middle East and higher
taxes all are being cited as contributing factors to weak - but not
disastrous - performances in the first two weeks of the crucial
holiday season.
   ``Thanksgiving weekend was pretty good. Otherwise, it's been
somewhat disappointing,'' J.C. Penney Co. spokesman Duncan Muir
said Tuesday.
   Some storeowners were pleased with sales so far, but others
found negative predictions proving correct. Analysts called overall
sales sluggish, reiterated forecasts for a disappointing Christmas
and said the East Coast was hardest hit.
   Child World Inc., the nation's No. 2 chain of toy stores, said
Tuesday it would stop paying old bills for six weeks so it can save
cash to buy toys for the Christmas season, according to a published
report today.
   Jeffrey Cole, chairman of CNC Holdings, which controls the
182-store chain of toy supermarkets, said it would begin a $100
million clearance sale and slash prices on Saturday in an effort to
increase business, The New York Times reported.
   Cole said the company wanted to avoid a Chapter 11 bankruptcy
court filing. Child World, based in Avon, Mass., concentrates on
the Northeast and Cole said Christmas sales were poor throughout
the chain. Child World is a distant second in stores and sales to
Toys ``R'' Us.
   The faltering economy is ``creating a difficult time for our
retailers,'' said Suzanne McMillan, senior vice president for
marketing at upscale Saks Fifth Avenue. ``We've experienced some
highs and lows.''
   Dayton Hudson Corp. Chairman Kenneth Macke said he was satisfied
with his company's peformance so far.
   ``The Thanksgiving weekend was very good and the next week since
then, business has been slower, much like we really anticipated it
would be,'' he said.
   Like many other retailers, Macke said he expected business to
pick up in the last 10 days before Christmas.
   Macke said his company's Target discount chain and Mervyn's
moderate-priced apparel stores have fared better than Dayton
Hudson's department stores - evidence that budget-conscious
consumers were ``trading down'' and buying cheaper gifts.
   Analysts described the retailers' results so far as choppy at
best.
   ``Sales seem to be running a little bit better than most
observers had thought going into the season, (but) it's not a good
season,'' said Donald Trott, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc. who follows specialty retailers such as apparel stores.
   Kidder Peabody &amp; Co. analyst Daniel Barry said the Northeast and
Middle Atlantic states were faring the worst. The Northwest and
oil-producing areas have had the strongest sales. Barry described
the Midwest as ``very spotty.''
   Many big retailers will announce sales results for November on
Thursday, and most of the big chains are expected to report
declines from November 1989 levels.
   The softness so far is n surprise. Retail sales slumped badly
in August after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and have not
recovered, even though the holiday season is a time when consumers
are expected to spend.
   Many shoppers, facing higher oil prices and taxes and concerned
about job security, have said they will do less shopping this
season.
   Retailers are getting no help from the weather, which has been
warmer than usual in many parts of the country. Consumers find it
hard to get in the mood for Christmas when the temperature is in
the 50s.
   But Douglas Kline, a vice president of General Growth Center
Cos., which manages 67 shopping centers in 26 states and Washington
D.C., said ``sales are basically humming'' at his firm's malls.
   ``We're seeing increases at most markets across the nation ...
especially mid-size markets in the Midwest,'' while business at two
shopping centers in the Northeast is slower, he said.

   People who use home heating oil have been hit
hard by prices pushed up by war fears, but the warmer-than-usual
fall has provided something of a break.
   But cold weather has to set in at some point, and consumer
advocates fear energy bills could jump again. Uncertainties in the
Middle East desert give heating oil the potential to move sharply
in either direction.
   ``If we begin to get into cold weather and supplies start to be
drawn down, we're very concerned prices could go even higher and
bust people's energy budget,'' said Richard Kessel, executive
director of the New York State Consumer Protection Board.
   Heating oil dealers in the Northeast agree a cold snap could
push prices up. But they see war or peace in the Middle East as
having a potentially greater impact, because supplies are running
well ahead of last year's levels.
   Dealers blame the prices, which in some cases have gone up about
four times as much as they might during most cold seasons, on war
fears that have mesmerized the market for months. But they say a
diplomatic solution for getting Iraq out of Kuwait could send
prices falling as sharply as they rose.
   If peace breaks out, ``the price of this stuff is going to fall
through the floor,'' said Eugene Guilford, of the Maine Oil Dealers
Association.
   Recent industry statistics showed the nation's stockpile of
heating oil to be about 15 million barrels higher than it was going
into December of 1989, largely because many in the industry stocked
up ahead of time to avoid a repeat of the run on supplies during
last December's extreme cold snap.
   The ample supply and the lack of cold weather has Kessel and
others thinking that consumers are unfairly being charged too much,
but it's not easy to pinpoint a culprit.
   ``Whether it's purposeful or whether it's a product of the
system, I think the market is anti-competitive,'' Kessel said.
   Consumer advocates say an average family that uses heating oil
can expect to pay $300 to $500 more to keep warm this cold season,
assuming prices stay about the same.
   The higher prices are also bad news for retail heating oil
dealers, who say they are getting squeezed by the Gulf crisis.
   ``We kind of got hit with a double whammy,'' said Vera Haskins,
executive vice president of Mauger &amp; Co., in Malvern, Pa. ``We got
hit with this warm weather, and on top of this we lost about 20 to
25 percent of our margin coming.''
   Mauger, which supplies fuel in the Philadelphia area, was forced
to lay off five people from its payroll of about 145, she said.
   ``We kept saying it's going to get cold, it's going to get cold,
but it didn't,'' Haskins said. Dealers are still hoping for cold
weather, although Haskins emphasizes most of them would prefer
normal, seasonal cold instead of record cold.
   Heating oil dealers would rather make their money on
lower-priced oil, both because they would have less cash invested
in their inventories and also because fewer people will look to
alternatives, such as natural gas, when heating oil is cheap.
   ``The fact that we're no longer as competitive is a killer in
our industry,'' Haskins said.
   Each $10 rise in the price of crude oil pushes heating oil up by
about 25 cents, said Bob Greenes, of the New York Oil Heat
Association. In some Northeast markets, the price has gone up as
much as 39 cents a gallon this season to more than $1.40 a gallon.

   Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. is abandoning
the once-lucrative trading of stocks of potential takeover targets,
a business hurt sharply by the end of the 1980s mergers boom.
   Also, First Boston Corp. confirmed Tuesday it laid off 55
workers in its fixed-income department as part of a companywide
restructuring designed to slash 200 jobs in the last two months of
the year.
   The moves were further signs of weakness on Wall Street. Top
firms are cutting jobs and axing key business areas to cope with a
three-year industry recession being made worse by the ailing
economy and Middle East crisis.
   Prudential-Bache said in a statement it is ceasing proprietary
risk arbitrage trading, that is, securities trading for the firm's
own account in stocks of companies believed to be targeted for
takeovers.
   The move was the second major business reduction by
Prudential-Bache in the last month. The firm laid off 120 of its
180 investment bankers because of a downturn in financing mergers
and acquisitions.
   Several other firms also have reduced their investment banking
forces. Most recently, PaineWebber Inc. this week began dismissing
a reported 18 percent of its 160 investment bankers.
   A Prudential-Bache spokeswoman said that Guy Wyser-Pratte, a top
arbitrager with 25 years at the firm, would help wind down the risk
arbitrage department's operations. Wyser-Pratte, 50, was said by
Wall Street sources to be seeking to move his 12-person department
to another firm.
   Risk arbitrage was one of Wall Street's most lucrative trading
areas in the booming 1980s. But a sharp decline in mergers and
acquisitions - more than 16 percent in the first 10 months of 1990,
according to IDD Information Services - has limited opportunities
for the risky trading activity.
   In a memo last month to employees, Prudential-Bache Chairman
George L. Ball said the risk arbitrage department lost money in
1989 and so far in 1990. ``Risk arb is a business which ails in a
bear market, and we are in a bear market,'' Ball said.
   The First Boston bond department layoffs include low-level
support staff and veteran professionals with as much as 20 years at
the firm, First Boston employees said.
   The cuts are part of a restructuring at First Boston announced
last month that features an overhaul of senior management and a
$725 million cash and equity injection by the Swiss owner of CS
First Boston Inc. First Boston Corp. is the main U.S. subsidiary of
CS First Boston.
   First Boston employees said the 55 layoffs included personnel
who reported to departed vice chairman William Voute and managing
directors E. Craig Coats and Ronald Stuart, who came toFirst
Boston from Salomon Inc.
   The three were touted highly by the firm but clashed repeatedly
with management. They and two other former Salomon executives were
ousted from First Boston last month.

   A Japanese bank has agreed to provide up to $30
million to back a partnership with a top Wall Street mergers and
acquisitions specialist in a new investment banking firm.
   The alliance between Sanwa Bank Ltd. and former First Boston
Corp. executive Michael Duval, announced Tuesday, is the latest
between major banks and emerging investment firms.
   Eric Gleacher, a former Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., executive, last
summer formed a partnership with Morgan Grenfell PLC, the merchant
banking company owned by Deutsche Bank Group.
   The latest new firm, to be known as Sanwa Duval, will be owned
by Duval, the bank and other partners, Duval said in an interview.
   Sanwa, the world's fifth-largest bank, has agreed to provide $30
million to back the partnership, Duval said. Sanwa Duval will take
over the operations currently carried out by the Merchant Banking
Group of Sanwa's offices in New York and Los Angeles.
   The new firm will be managed by Duval and Shuhei Sato, senior
vice president of Sanwa's merchant banking arm.
   Duval left First Boston as a managing director last summer and
formed his own firm, The Duval Group. He had helped arrange First
Boston's merger with its London-based affiliate, Financiere Credit
Suisse-First Boston.
   Before joining First Boston in 1984, Duval spent seven years at
Mead Corp., and before that served in the Nixon and Ford
administrations.
   Sanwa Duval will be an investment banker, advising clients on
proposed transactions, but will not create its own fund to
participate in deals of its own, Duval said.
   That decision places Sanwa Duval in a different league from
Wasserstein Perella &amp; Co., the investment firm formed by two other
First Boston alumni. Although Bruce Wasserstein and Joseph Perella
have advised clients on deals including the $24.5 billion buyout of
RJR Nabisco Inc., they also have entered into transactions
themselves.
   Duval said he was more interested in advising long-term clients
rather than picking up business on a deal-by-deal basis with
clients who are potential rivals in transactions.
   Duval said he expects his new firm mostly to advise U.S.
companies seeking strategic acquisitions, joint ventures or
divestitures. But he said he also expects to handle cross-border
transactions, in which one party is American and the other foreign.
   While most cross-border deals are likely to involve European
parties, Duval predicted the firm will be handling an increasing
amount of transactions with Japanese firms.
   Although Japanese markets have generally been closed to American
buyers and investors, ``I think it's opening up,'' Duval said.
   Sanwa Duval expects to be operating in early 1991, after it has
received government approval, Duval said.

<HEAD>Coke, Pepsi Announce Recycled Plastic Bottles</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the latest corporate attempt to meet
environmental concerns, Coca-Cola and Pepsi Cola plan to market
products in recycled plastic bottles.
   The rival soft drink makers said Tuesday they were seeking
government approval for separate proposals to use recycled plastic.
The Food and Drug Administration to date has approved just one case
- submitted by an egg company - in which recycled plastic can be
used in direct contact with food.
   The FDA regards recycled plastic as ``an indirect additive'' to
food, said agency spokesman Chris Lecos.
   Plastic bottles are widely recycled now, but the finished
material is used for such products as carpeting, piping and
non-food containers - not for food packaging.
   The environmental group Greenpeace said it was unimpressed with
the cola makers' plans. Greenpeace spokeswoman Julie Brenegar said
the beverage companies would do better by eliminating plastic
packaging altogether.
   ``Plastics recycling is yet another way the plastics industry is
trying to justify the use of plastics,'' she said, adding that new
``virgin'' plastic is needed even for recycled packages.
   Therefore, she said, plastic recycling makes only a small dent
in the amount of raw material introduced to the environment.
   Jackie Prince, a staff scientist at the Washington-based
Environmental Defense Fund, said the Coke and Pepsi plans mark a
step in the right direction by expanding the uses for recycled
plastic.
   ``The reality is there is a lot of plastic out there now, and
we'd like to see what's there recycled,'' she said. ``This brings
plastics recycling further along the learning curve.''
   Coke spokesman Randy Donaldson said the recycling proposal was
submitted to the FDA in June, and officials at the Atlanta-based
company hope to test market the new bottles sometime in 1991 before
launching a full-scale rollout.
   Pepsi also said it plans to have the recycled bottles in stores
next year. FDA spokesman Jeff Nesbitt said the agency has been
talking to Pepsi's partner in the project, Goodyear Tire and Rubber
Co., about their planned recycling process and plans to review the
data shortly.
   The FDA review of the bottles will include analysis of product
quality, consumer safety and environmental impact.
   ``I think recycling is one thing the cola warriors agree on
totally,'' said Andrew Giangola, a spokesman at the Pepsi Cola
Co.'s headquarters in Somers, N.Y. ``They are both working with the
mutual goal of creating the most environmentally correct
packaging.''
   ``Producing new plastic beverage bottles with a blend of
recycled plastic is a significant step ahead in plastics
recycling,'' said M. Douglas Ivester, senior vice president at The
Coca-Cola Co.
   Several companies have taken steps to reduce the amount of solid
waste disposed of in landfills. McDonald's, in a highly publicized
move, recently announced it will stop using plastic foam containers
at its fast food restaurants.
   Coke and Pepsi already use recycled steel, aluminum and glass
for packaging. Pepsi officials estimated that about one-third of
soft drinks are in plastic bottles, though cans are the most widely
used.
   Coke said its process, developed with Hoechst Celanese Corp.,
involves breaking down the bottle polymer into original molecules,
then reconstructing the purified resin for use in making new
bottles.
   Pepsi's bottles, to be made by Sewell Plastics Inc. of Atlanta,
use Repete, a recycled resin based on ground soft drink bottles and
produced by Goodyear. The material is put back together with raw
materials to make the recycled bottles.
   Jesse Meyers, publisher of the industry newsletter Beverage
Digest, said recycled bottles give the soft drink business a way to
defend continued use of plastic amid fighting between the glass and
plastics industries.
   Despite the pronouncements of concern for the environment, it's
also a way to stimulate soft drink consumption by attracting
publicity to the products, Meyers said.
   ``The cola wars, whether its rock singers, taste tests or
packaging - it creates business for the industry,'' e said. ``The
cola wars is the only war where there are no losers.''

   Sales of North American-made vehicles tumbled
20.4 percent in late November compared with last year, mainly
because of a sharp slump in truck sales.
   The decline reported Tuesday and recent announcements of
production cuts for the rest of the year reflect a slumping auto
industry as the U.S. economy softens.
   Among the Big Three automakers, Ford Motor Co. suffered the
most, but General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp. didn't fare much
better.
   Late November sales of Ford vehicles dropped 30.1 percent, GM's
sales fell 22.5 percent and Chrysler's were down 17.4 percent.
   Combined, the Big Three and the seven Japanese companies making
cars and trucks in the United States reported they sold an average
of 29,510 vehicles during the Nov. 21-30 period this year, compared
with a daily rate of 37,062 during the same time last year.
   The Big Three automakers held 68.3 percent of the market for the
month.
   Light truck sales fell 28.5 percent and car sales dropped 15.2
percent.
   ``Sales have been fairly good this summer and fall,'' said auto
analyst David Healy of the investment firm Barclays de Zoete Wedd
in New York. ``That thump you heard was car sales falling out of
bed.''
   The late-November car sales rate was among the lowest of recent
history, he said.
   ``You have to go back to early October 1982 to find a (sales)
rate lower than that in the last 10 days (of November),'' Healy
said. At that time, the U.S. economy was in the midst of a deep
recession.
   For the month of November, with major overseas automakers
included, combined car and truck sales were 4.3 percent behind last
year's pace. Car sales fell 1.5 percent and truck sales were off
9.6 percent.
   The auto industry, indicating agreement with a softening
economy, has cut production schedules for the rest of the year.
   GM Chairman Robert Stempel last week said he expects the giant
automaker's fourth-quarter earnings will decline significantly from
the third quarter, when the company earned $109 million, not
including a $2.1 billion one-time loss it took for plant closing
costs.
   Through the first 11 months of this year, total car and truck
sales in the United States stood at 13.15 million, down 4.9 percent
from the same time last year.
   The industry's slump began in the third quarter of last year and
generally, sales rates for 10-day periods have been lower than
year-ago periods.
   Ford suffered the most of the Big Three in this year's
late-November reporting period for North American-made cars and
light trucks. Automakers report sales of imported vehicles only on
a monthly basis.
   Ford's combined sales of North American-made cars and trucks for
late November were down 30.1 percent compared with last year.
   Company sales analyst Joel Pitcoff said part of the downturn
stemmed from fewer fleet orders, including those from rental car
companies, law enforcement agencies, taxi companies and big
corporations.
   Through November of this year, Ford's cars and trucks were
selling at a pace 7.7 percent slower than last year.
   GM said its combined car and truck sales for late November fell
22.5 percent. Through the first 11 months of the year, sales of
GM's North American-made cars and light trucks were down 4.1

   Chrysler, which has suffered the most in this year's sales
downturn, said its late-November car and truck sales were off 17.4
percent through November of this year, the company's combined car

<TEXT>
   NCR Corp. Chairman Charles Exley Jr. has
told employees the computer maker isn't interested in a $6 billion
buyout offer from AT&amp;T but the company's directors will have its
own chance to reject it.
   While the board unanimously rejected a previous offer of $85 per
share from AT&amp;T, it has yet to formally vote on a $90-per-share
proposal. A board meeting was scheduled to be conducted by
telephone today.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. announced its stock-swap
offer to buy the NCR, the nation's fifth-largest computer maker, on
Sunday.
   Exley said the deal made no business sense and that NCR had no
interest in merging operations with AT&amp;T. The telephone giant has
said it may make a tender offer directly to shareholders if NCR's
board doesn't act on the proposal by this evening.
   NCR stock, which soared nearly $25 a share on Monday, rose
another $2 to $83.50 Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange. AT&amp;T,
which had fallen $2 a share, recovered slightly to close at $30.37{
a share, up 25 cets.
   In a speech to NCR employees Tuesday, Exley urged workers to
have confidence in the ability of management to make decisions that
are in the best interests of all who have a stake in the company.
   ``We have made it perfectly clear to AT&amp;T and anyone else who
cares to listen that we have no interest in being acquired, and we
must face the fact that we may face a lengthy takeover battle,''
Exley told the workers.
   A union representing 110,000 AT&amp;T employees encouraged NCR to
oppose the buyout, saying the takeover could lead to layoffs at
both companies if AT&amp;T is forced to make cuts because of a high
purchase price.
   ``I do not believe that AT&amp;T's offer for NCR is in the best
interest of your employee stakeholders nor those shareholders
committed to the long-term business efforts of NCR,'' James Irvine,
vice president of the Communications Workers of America, said in a
letter to Exley.
   In another development, an NCR shareholder filed a lawsuit
against the NCR board, alleging that the directors have breached
their duty by depriving shareholders of the chance to increase the
value of their stock.
   Sidney Kaufman of Cincinnati asked a local court to issue an
injunction forcing the board to fully cooperate in any proposed
transaction that would maximize shareholder value.
   Meanwhile, U.S. Senate officials said NCR officials have sought
a meeting on Capitol Hill to detail their fears about the proposed
buyout.
   Nancy Coffey, spokeswoman for Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio,
said the senator's staff members have agreed to meet with NCR
officials this week. Metzenbaum is chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee's subcommittee on monopolies and business rights.

<HEAD>Bondholders Top List of Continental Creditors</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Thousands of bondholders who financed the
expansion of Continental Airlines over the past seven years top a
600-page list of creditors in a bankruptcy petition filed by the
carrier.
   The Chapter 11 filing lists $620.5 million of Continental's $2.2
billion debt owed to bondholders. About $1.7 billion of
Continental's debt is secured by collateral.
   Continental, the remnants of Frank Lorenzo's Texas Air Corp.
empire, said it filed for the reorganization Monday in federal
court in Wilmington, Del., because it was overwhelmed by its debts
and surging fuel prices.
   Banks in California, Texas, New Jersey, New York and Switzerland
are acting as trustees for the bonds, which are due between 1991
and 2005. Bank officials, who declined to be identified, said they
had not yet seen a copy of the bankruptcy petition and declined
comment.
   A creditors' committee is being formed to work with the
bankruptcy court to restructure Continental's debt.
   The bonds issued by Continental make up the lion's share of the
largest unsecured creditors listed in the petition. Others include
Pratt-Whitney Canada Inc.; Dobbs International Services Inc., an
airline food service vendor; American Express Co.; General Electric
Corp.; and Boeing Co.
   The filing was the second time in seven years Continental has
sought to reorganize. An analyst with Price Waterhouse said there
was no limit to the number of times a company can file for
protection from creditors, but a court must approve the move.
   In 1983, as Lorenzo was building Texas Air into what once was
the nation's largest airline operator, Continental filed for
protection from creditors amid a bitter labor dispute with its
union.
   The firing allowed Continental to scrap union contracts and hire
low-cost replacements for strikers. It also led to a change in
federal bankruptcy law to make such a move more difficult.
   As of Sept. 30, Continental had $4.77 billion in assets and
$5.85 billion in total liabilities, with $138 million cash on hand.

   Once considered river trash, the
whiskered catfish is turning up in avant-garde restaurants and on
fast-food menus from coast to coast.
   ``I eat in a lot of places around this country. ... Many of them
now have catfish on the menu,'' says Craig Claiborne, cookbook
author and retired New York Times food editor.
   Last year, sales of farm-raised catfish ranked the variety as
one of the nation's top five seafoods, behind only tuna, shrimp,
cod and Alaska pollock.
   But despite its rising popularity, the boon predicted for the
aquaculture industry in the 1960s hasn't fully come to pass.
   ``The pie is getting larger, but the pieces are getting
smaller,'' said Roger Barlow, catfish marketing director for the
Mississippi Department of Agriculture.
   Nutritional value and the consistent taste brought by
high-protein feed allowed the catfish industry to grow
dramatically, but that growth also brought more competition,
especially in processing, Barlow said.
   Catfish farmers also are facing rising costs, labor demands and
softening sales.
   Catfish farming started in Mississippi in 1966 with 40 acres.
Now, the industry is the state's fourth leading agricultural crop,
contributing more than $300 million to the state economy in 1989.
   Many farmers in the Mississippi Delta region switched to catfish
in the early 1980s because the traditional agriculture industry was
slumping. Aquaculture allowed them to use their land and skills and
brought new economic strength to the state.
   The new industry also provided thousands of new jobs for
unskilled and semiskilled workers idled when machinery replaced
many jobs throughout the Delta region.
   The state's catfish industry now employs more than 6,000 people,
with an annual payroll of more than $76 million, according to The
Catfish Institute in Belzoni, which is located in Humphreys County,
``The Catfish Capital of the World.''
   This year, catfish operations in the state will raise, harvest
and process more than 380 million pounds of fresh catfish.
   The fish is processed by 25 to 30 companies, most of which are
in the state, including the nation's largest two.
   But a glut in processing forced four processing plants to close
in 1989-90, and many processors say they are pinched by higher
prices they pay to farmers.
   About 85 percent of the catfish supplied to processors in
Mississippi is produced by members of the Catfish Bargaining
Association, which fixes selling prices for processors. Processors
are paying farmers 80 cents a pound this year, compared to 71 or 72
cents last year.
   Some processors say this year's price is about 10 cents too
high.
   The nation's second-largest processor, Isola-based Country
Skillet Catfish Co., has even threatened to expand into farming
unless it can secure lower prices from farmers.
   ``If we're faced with no option, we'll start farming,'' said
Dick Stevens, Country Skillet's president. ``We can't afford to buy
fish at what prices are today. We have to buy raw materials
relevant to market prices.''
   Country Skillet's retail sales and sales of live fish are
slowing because of the higher prices, Stevens said.
   ``I guess the farmers wanted to make a sackful of money,'' he
said. ``Instead of creating a good situation, farmers have created
a nightmare.''
   Country Skillet, which is owned by food processing giant ConAgra
Inc. of Omaha, Neb., is among the major catfish processors in the
Delta region rebelling against efforts by farmers to control the
price of whole fish.
   But many processors are cooperatives of catfish growers, who
benefit from higher base prices.
   Delta Pride Catfish Inc. of Indianola - the nation's largest
catfish processor - is owned by a 180-member farmer cooperative,
and it supports fixed prices.
   That hasn't stopped workers from the United Food and Commercial
Workers unions from going on strike at two Delta Pride plants.
   The workers walked out Sept. 12 after turning down a contract
proposal offering a 4.8 percent average wage increase in the first
year and pay increases averaging 35 to 90 cents per hour over the
remaining two years of the pact.
   The workers, many of whom are unskilled or semiskilled black
women, say the raises are not enough. Negotiations are to resume
Dec. 12.
   The increased demand for catfish, due no doubt to its more
refined taste and image, is one of the best safeguards that the
industry will survive, Barlow said.
   In years past, the fishy-tasting river variety of catfish were
caught with a cane pole with worm bait. They were cleaned, rolled
in cornmeal and deep-fried, and usually served with hush puppies -
small fried balls of cornmeal dough.
   Now consumers can buy pond-fed catfish in grocery stores as
whole dressed fish, steaks, filets, strips and nuggets. Recipes
offer ways to poach, barbecue, broil, smoke, stir-fry, fry, bake,
steam, braise, stew, blacken, saute or grill dishes.
   ``French chefs I've talked with are fond of both the flavor and
texture of pond-raised catfish,'' Claiborne said.

   LTV Steel Corp. said it is closing three
production units at its Cleveland plant and laying off about 900
employees because of weak economic conditions.
   The units include a blast furnace that will close Friday, and a
steel production department and a direct rolling complex that will

   LTV Steel said the units would remain closed until market
conditions improve.
   The company said about 90 percent of the affected workers had

<HEAD>Defense in Commodities Trial Concedes Rule Violations But Denies
Fraud</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL A. DRISCOLL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense attorneys tried to impress upon jurors
the distinction between rule violations and fraud as the 11-week
trial of 10 soybean traders and brokers winds to a close.
   ``Violating a rule is not inconsistent with good faith,''
attorney Matthias Lydon told U.S. District Court jurors in closing
arguments Tuesday.
   His client, Edward A. Cox, and the nine others are charged with
racketeering conspiracy and fraud in their dealings at the Chicago
Board of Trade. They were among 48 people arrested in a federal
undercover investigation at the board and the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
   The government has presented witnesses who testified that they
participated in improper trading with the defendants or witnessed
it.
   In their closing arguments, prosecutors scoffed at the concept
of traders breaking the rules to benefit customers.
   ``These men intended to get money from customers under false
pretenses,'' said Mark Rotert, an assistant U.S. attorney. ``They
think things like ethics, fairness and the law are a matter of
context.''
   Defense attorney Jim Epstein conceded his client, Martin J.
Dempsey, broke trading rules, but denied any intent to defraud, and
instead insisted these violations often benefited customers at no
one's expense.
   ``Did he violate the rules?'' Epstein asked rhetorically,
referring to Dempsey. ``Absolutely.
   ``Did he attempt to commit fraud? Absolutely not.''
   Epstein reminded jurors that testimony indicated many of the
rule violations were an everyday practice on the trading floor.
   One such violation is curb trading, which occurs in the trading
pit in the seconds or minutes after the closing bel.
   ``Sure, he did curb trading,'' Epstein said of his client. ``Is
he proud of it? No. Did he try to conceal it? Of course, he did.
   ``But not because he was committing ... fraud, but because he
was breaking the rules.''
   The defense contends the prosecution tried to confuse the two
issues, to trick the jury into believing that concealing what they
were doing was a sign they were trying to cheat the customers.
   ``Curb trading has been going on for who knows how long. It goes
on every day; it's no secret,'' Epstein told the jury.
   He said customers sometimes file orders just seconds before the
close. And there's no way, he said, for a broker to comply without
trading beyond the bell. At other times, Epstein said, a customer
specifies his buy-or-sell order should be made at the closing
price, which sometimes makes trading go beyond beyond the closing.
   ``So, people get the fill on the close,'' he said. ``Other than
breaking the rule, you're not cheating anyone.''
   On trial before Judge George Marovich, in addition to Dempsey
and Cox, are Charles W. Bergstrom, Bradley Ashman, William A.
Barcal III, Thomas P. Kenney, John Ryan, Joel J. Fetchenhier,
Sheldon Schneider and John A. Vercillo.

<TEXT>
   Australia's government-owned overseas
telecommunications carrier, OTC Ltd., signed a construction and
maintenance agreement Wednesday with 35 other carriers to build the
world's longest undersea optical-fiber cable system.
   The $620 million cable network will be built over the next four
years and stretch more than 10,000 miles from Sydney to Hawaii
through Auckland, New Zealand, and from Sydney to Guam.
   The South Pacific network cable will be able to handle more than
30,000 simultaneous telephone conversations, OTC said.
   OTC will be the biggest shareholder in the South Pacific
network, which will join an optical-fiber network in the North
Pacific forming a loop connecting the Pacific rim nations.
   Other companies taking part include TNI of New Zealand, KDD of
Japan and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. of the United States.
   Officiating at the signing ceremony, Prime Minister Bob Hawke
said the telecommunications loop would be of enormous economic
significance to the region and its interaction with the rest of the
world.
   Hawke also said the link would provide a conduit for the new
privately owned telecommunications company which will compete with
OTC and Telecom, the government-owned domestic carrier.

<HEAD>Toy Store Plans To Delay Payments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AVON, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Child World Inc., trying to get through a
cash squeeze, said it would delay paying for merchandise ordered
before today until Jan. 15 and suspend payments on the principal on
a $122 million credit line.
   However, the toy retailer said Tuesday it would make interest
payments on its debt and pay cash for all merchandise ordered from
now until Jan. 15.
   Child World also announced steep markdowns on its merchandise
for the remainder of the Christmas season to raise cash. The move
will result in the firm reporting a substantial loss for the year,
the company said.
   Toy retailers are expected to pay for merchandise shipped as
early as July by Dec. 10, but Child World is short of cash and has
a $19 million bank payment due Jan. 1.
   Although it was delaying payment for merchandise already
shipped, ``cash on hand, together with cash generated from
operations, will be enough to assure vendors of prompt payment for
new shipments,'' the company said in a statement.
   The retailer said it was negotiating for an extension of its
working capital credit line until 1992.
   Company President Peter J. Hayes said discussions were being
held with potential buyers of the company, including Trefoil
Capital Partners LP of Los Angeles, the group that last month
backed out of a deal to buy Child World for about $180 million.
   The retailer, with 182 stores in 32 states, is the second
largest toy merchant in the country after Toys R Us Inc. It has
annual sales of about $900 million.
   Child World reported a third quarter loss this year of $14.4
million on sales of $185.6 million, compared with a loss of $4.1
million on sales of $157.3 for the third quarter of 1989.
   The company's nine-month loss was reported as $30.3 million on
sales of $466.5 million.
   It earned $5.8 million in 1989.
   The company owes Hasbro Inc. $40 million, Mattel Inc. $25
million and Tyco Toys Inc. about $20 million, The Boston Globe said
today.
   Hayes said rumors that Child World may be close to filing for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection are false.
   ``We have value in excess of $200 million and no long-term
debt,'' he said. ``After we get through Christmas, we will be in a
much better position with cash.''
   CNC Holding Inc., a private Cleveland company, owns 82 percent
of Child World stock.

   The stock market was mixed today, hesitating
after its advance of the past three sessions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 60.89 points from
last Thursday through Tuesday's close, slipped back 4.45 to
2,575.25 in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 10 to 9 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 490 up, 446
down and 553 unchanged.
   Big Board volume came to 24.35 million shares as of 10 a.m. on
Wall Street.
   Stocks have been staging a yearend rally in recent weeks,
encouraged by falling interest rates and steps by the Federal
Reserve toward an easier credit policy.
   But analysts say investors have still been proceeding cautiously
as they wait for more evidence about the prospective severity of
the economic slump.
   Unsettling news is expected on Friday when the Labor Department
issues its monthly report on the employment situation.
   If advance estimates are accurate, the figures will show a drop
of as much as 100,000 in payroll employment and an increase in the
civilian unemployment rate from 5.7 percent in October to 5.8
percent or 5.9 percent in November.
   NCR rose 2&rsqb; to 85~ and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph dropped &lsqb;
to 30\. NCR has resisted takeover overtures made by AT&amp;T earlier
this week.
   On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 14.11 points
to 2,579.70.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 3 to 2 in
nationwide trading of NYSE-listed stocks, with 907 up, 639 down and
457 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 185.82 million
shares, up from 177.07 million in the previous session.

   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is making its first
foray into New England with five discount stores planned in New
Hampshire and a wholesale club scheduled to open in Maine.
   Patrick Peery, Wal-Mart's real estate manager, said Tuesday the
retailer chose New Hampshire as the site for the discount stores
because the state has no sales tax.
   The new Wal-Marts will be located near the borders of
Massachusetts and Maine to take advantage of shoppers from those
states who come to New Hampshire to avoid their states' sales
taxes, Peery said.
   The stores will be in Somersworth, Amherst, Derry, Seabrook and
Hooksett.
   Wal-Mart also said it would open a Sam's Wholesale Club in
Scarborough, Maine. Sam's Clubs are cash-and-carry warehouses open
to managers and owners of other stores and to groups such as
retirees.
   Wal-Mart, based largely in the Sunbelt and the Midwest, operates
1,527 discount stores in 35 states, including 146 Sam's Wholesale
Clubs and four Hypermart-USA stores.
   The company is the nation's third-largest retailer, behind
Sears, Roebuck and Co. and Kmart Corp.

   The European Community was given a
deadline of noon Thursday to draw up a new proposal for sharper
cuts in agriculture subsidies and rescue deadlocked world trade
talks, officials said today.
   Uruguayan Foreign Minister Hector Gros Espiell imposed the
deadline after a series of meetings to try to find a way to move
the stalled Uruguay Round negotiations.
   ``We're ready to move by noon tomorrow,'' said Hugo Paemen, a
senior negotiator for the 12-nation trading bloc. ``The EC is
discussing new agriculture proposals as well as proposals in other
areas.''
   But Ray MacSharry, the community's top farm official who has
been a hard-liner in the negotiations, said, ``Our degree of
flexibility is minimal.''
   ``A lot of contracting partners need to rethink, not just the
European Community. The EC cannot be expected to give in on
everything,'' he told reporters.
   David Woods, spokesman for the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, which is sponsoring the talks, confirmed the action by Gros
Espiell, who is presiding over the bargaining.
   ``He basically wants to see some new approach from the community
by midday tomorrow in order to restart the negotiations,'' said
Woods.
   The talks stalled Tuesday amid heavy pressure from the United
States and other countries on the European Community to make deep
cuts in farm supports. The talks also cover trade in services,
textiles and other major areas.
   Woods said Gros Espiell disclosed his deadline in a series of
meetings with trade negotiators to try to solve the crisis.
   U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said Gros Espiell
``has informed folks that unless several of these major areas are
essentially brought to a conclusion, or close to a conclusion, by
tomorrow (Thursday) noon, we're never going to get finished.''
   ``So in essence he's given the conferees until tomorrow noon to
get on top of these major issues,'' Yeutter told reporters.
   Gros Espiell said Tuesday the talks were in a ``very serious
impasse'' and started meeting with individual delegations to
explore prospects for a breakthrough.
   Australia and Canada appealed to the European Community to back
off its hard-line position opposing deep cuts in farm supports and
save the 107-nation Uruguay Round, the most wide-ranging trade
bargaining ever.
   Work continued behind-the-scenes to try to strike deals in some
of the other 15 areas under negotiation, but officials conceded
that little progress could be made until a solution was found to
the agriculture dispute.
   ``I don't think anybody is going to commit themselves to
anything while the negotiation is in this stage,'' said the GATT
spokesman Woods. ``We are trying to see if there is any chance for
movement in the areas that are blocked.''
   The negotiations, kicked off in 1986 in the Uruguayan resort of
Punta del Este, are designed to overhaul world trade in 15 areas,
including agriculture, manufactured goods, textiles and services,
such as telecommunications, transportation and banking.
   The latest week of bargaining, which opened on Monday, has been
stalled by the European Community's refusal to go along with deep
cuts in its extensive farm support program - as demanded by the
United States and others.
   Attention focused on an evening meeting between German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President Francois Mitterrand for
any sign of a breakthrough on the agriculture problem.
   Leading up to the talks, France and Germany were the most
resistant to deep cuts in farm supports. The German government had
been worried about the farm vote in last Sunday's elections.
   Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke said he was ``imploring''
Kohl and Mitterrand ``to inject the political will and the courage
which is obviously necessary to prevent a debacle in these
negotiations.''
   John Crosbie, Canada's trade minister, said, ``We would like to
have Mr. Kohl and Mr. Mitterrand instruct (their negotiators) ...
that their offer now has to be changed in accordance with what the
rest of the world is wanting.''
   There have been hints of cracks in the community's position
opposing any but the most modest reductions in farm subsidies.
Britain, the Netherlands and, surprisingly, Germany have urged more
flexibility.
   Trade ministers of the 12-nation community were scheduled to
meet in early evening to take a fresh look at the situation.
   U.S. President George Bush seemed to signal a willingness to
give some on the American side.
   Bush, traveling Tuesday in Uruguay, said, ``We are not locked on
a specific figure'' on how deeply farm subsidies should be cut.
``We are locked on the fact that there has to be inclusion of all
categories (of products).
   In an October offer, the Bush administration proposed cuts in
farm subsidies ranging from 75 percent to 90 percent over the next
decade. Export subsidies, payments to promote sales of a country's
products overseas, were targeted for the deepest slashes.
   The European Community so far has offered to snip only 30
percent from subsidies for major crops over 10 years, beginning in
1986. Some reductions already have been made, prompting U.S.
critics to contend that much less than 30 percent would occur in
the next five years.
   The Uruguay Round is the eighth in a series of negotiating
sessions since World War II designed to reduce barriers to world
trade.
   The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was established in
1947 as a forum and an agreement for promoting free trade.

<HEAD>Government Approves Temporary Layoffs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Italian government on Wednesday
authorized Olivetti to temporarily lay off 2,800 workers next month
following a drop in international sales for the office automation
equipment giant.
   But the government rejected an Olivetti request for a special
early retirement program for 5,000 Italian-based workers.
   The group is trying to reduce its worldwide workforce by 7,000
to 47,000 in 1991.
   Budget minister Cirino Pomicino stressed that the retirement
plan, calling for men to retire at 50 instead of 55 and women to
leave at 47 instead of 50, would be an unbearable burden for the
state pension fund.
   Olivetti, which is owned and managed by Italian financier Carlo
De Benedetti, said that the layoffs, to begin in January, will be a
temporary measure. But it did not disclose its duration.
   The 2,800 workers to be laid off will receive compensation of up
to 80 percent of their original salary from a state fund.
   The powerful metalworkers unions called a five-hour strike in
the Olivetti factories to protest what they called the company's
one-sided decision on layoffs.
   Unions are also opposed to Olivetti's early retirement proposal.
The company's managing director, Vittorio Cassoni, said the plan is
not an option but is necessary to help Olivetti face the crisis in
the computer industry.
   Analysts said that Olivetti's crisis is due to the growing
competition of U.S. and Japanese manufacturers and to weak demand
worldwide, which is severely affecting the major European makers of
information technology.
   Office automation is not the only sector faced with a severe
recession in Italy.
   Fiat, Italy's auto giant, has laid off about 70,000 workers this
month to cut its production.

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USX Corp. Chairman Charles A. Corry said the
company hopes to resum talks soon with the United Steelworkers
union, but said the likelihood of a strike has increased.
   Speaking to financial writers Tuesday in New York, Corry said
USX hoped to reach an early agreement with 18,000 union workers.
Negotiators for the company and the union met this fall to try to
work out a new pact.
   The current contract expires Jan. 31, and talks were recessed on
Nov. 10.
   ``We had some negotiations. We made an offer. I don't think that
offer was ever countered,'' Corry said. ``The early effort
failed.''
   Corry said one stumbling block is a union demand for a more
lucrative contract than agreements reached with other steel
companies.
   After his remarks, Corry told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette he was
unable to say if USX is willing to continue operating under a
contract extension if the deadline is not met.
   ``You have a different situation than last time. It was
concessionary bargaining then, so if you worked under the existing
contract, you paid more,'' Corry said. ``This time it's really a
question of if the steelworkers are willing to work under the
existing contract.''
   Corry also said he believes a proxy battle with financier Carl
C. Icahn is inevitable. Icahn, the company's largest shareholder
with a 13 percent stake, asked USX to restructure its steel and
energy units before the annual meeting in May.
   Icahn has said he will seek to place five people on the board of
directors to force the issue.
   ``I have to take him at his word,'' Corry said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Labor market conditions worsened in October with
no sign of a quick turnaround, a leading business research group
reported Wednesday in a monthly survey of help-wanted advertising.
   The Conference Board's Help-Wanted Advertising Index fell to 116
in October, six points below the September level and 34 points
below the year-earlier level.
   The index's decline substantiated other assessments of growing
trouble in the U.S. labor market, which has been beset by layoffs
and reduced hiring plans because of an underlying economic decline
that some are calling a recession.
   On Monday, for example, Manpower Inc., the world's largest
temporary help firm, reported in a quarterly survey that hiring
plans of U.S. companies will plunge to ``recession depths'' in the
first quarter of 1991.
   ``The decline in the economy in the fourth quarter affords very
little opportunity to develop new jobs,'' Conference Board
economist Kenneth Goldstein said. ``Layoffs continue to climb, as
does the national unemployment rate.''
   The national unemployment level, which moved from 5.2 percent in
June to 5.7 percent as of October, will likely climb to 6.5 percent
in the second half of 1991, Goldstein asserted. The Labor
Department is scheduled to release its figures on November
unemployment this Friday.
   The Conference Board survey showed advertising volume in
newspapers fell almost everywhere in the country, particularly in
the Southeast with a 12.8 percent decline and New England with a
9.2 percent decline. The least affected was the Pacific region, but
help-wanted ad volume there still fell 4.2 percent.
   More disturbing, the Conference Board survey suggested, was a
5.2 percent drop in help-wanted advertising in the Midwest, which
has enjoyed relative prosperity in recent months because of a
manufacturing resurgence and foreign demand for U.S. goods.
   ``There has been a significant deterioration in the labor
markets of the Pacific and the South Atlantic,'' Goldstein said.
``Even more telling - job advertising declines are now firmly set
in America's heartland.''
   The survey assesses help-wanted advertising volume in 51 major
newspapers across the country every month and is considered a
sensitive barometer to changes in the supply of jobs.
   The Conference Board is a business-funded research organization
based in New York.

<HEAD>Propose Shakeup of Airport `Slot' Allocation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Community's executive
commission on Wednesday outlined a proposal toredistribute takeoff
and landing ``slots'' at airports in the economic bloc.
   The proposal, intended to help smaller airlines compete in the
increasingly congested EC market, has attracted widespread
criticism from airlines.
   Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner for competition policy, said
smaller airlines would be given priority for half of slots -
landing and take-off spaces in the air-traffic pattern - that
became available.
   He said that the ``sting in the tail'' of the proposal was that
the commission could intervene in cases where it thought that slots
weren't distributed fairly.
   The plan represented a ``concerted attempt by us to provide
opportunities to smaller airlines who up to now have not had
them,'' Brittan told reporters.
   Under the complicated proposal, slots allocated to but unused by
bigger airlines at a particular airport would be distributed to
smaller airlines, defined as those holding no more than 30 percent
of slots there.
   Any airline not using more than 65 percent of its allocated
slots would have to relinquish excess slots for redistribution,
Brittan said.
   A problem with the proposal is that small airlines themselves
are not sure it will work. Many say the existing system for
allocating slots through traffic-scheduling committees run by the
airlines works reasonably well.
   Another problem is that even if they gain more slots at busy
airports, small airlines do not have large enough fleets to
compete.
   EC Transport Commissioner Karel Van Miert said he did not know
how many slots the major airlines would have to give up. ``It's
very difficult because of the reciprocity between airports,'' he
said.
   Under the proposal, if a new airline were granted a takeoff slot
at one airport, it would have to be given a landing slot at
another. The Commission would limit the number of new slots for new
airlines to four each day.

   The European Community's executive
commission Wednesday proposed requiring large firms operating in
more than one member country to establish councils for consulting
workers in decision-making.
   At the least, the councils would be forums where employes would
be ``informed of, and consulted on, any management proposal likely
to have serious consequences for the interest of the workers,'' the
commission said in a statement.
   Individual EC nations have laws requiring companies to consult
workers, ut there are no rules for companies operating in more
than one EC nation.
   The Commission termed its proposal, which requires the approval
of the 12 EC states before it can become law, an ``important
moment'' in the 12-nation trade bloc's progress toward the 1992
internal market.
   Only companies operating in at least two EC states and employing
at least 1,000 workers would be required to set up the ``Works
Councils'' under the legislation proposed by the Commission.

<HEAD>Saatchi Posts Annual Loss of 98.2 Million Pounds, Omits Dividend</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co. PLC, the world's
second-largest advertising agency group, said Wednesday it lost
98.2 million pounds, or $166 million, in fiscal 1990, the biggest
yearly loss ever for such a company.
   It was the second consecutive annual loss for the company that
grew rapidly through acquisitions in the 1980s to become one of the
biggest advertising and marketing services companies in the world.
   But the company stumbled when it branched out into the
consulting business and has spent more than a year arranging sales
of those operations.
   In announcing its huge loss, Saatchi also said it wouldn't pay a
dividend to its shareholders this year. It paid a dividend of 9
pence, or 15 cents, a share a year ago.
   The company blamed the loss for the year ended Sept. 30 on its
efforts to focus on its communications operations and to withdraw
from consulting.
   ``Our withdrawal from consulting reduces our downside risk,''
the company said in a statement.
   Saatchi said it plans to concentrate on advertising, media
buying, direct marketing and public relations.
   But Saatchi's operating results from communications businesses
like these declined in the latest year. Results were strong in the
United States and continental Europe, but sank in Britain and the
rest of the world.
   The overall loss was the second annual loss in a row for
Saatchi, which had previously bought ads of its own to tout its
string of earnings gains. Saatchi lost 72.7 million pounds in
fiscal 1989.
   Chairman Maurice Saatchi said in a statement ``1991 will be a
difficult year for the group but when market conditions do improve
I believe the group will be well positioned to benefit from the
upturn.''
   Advertising agencies generally have been hurt by the worldwide
economic downturn.
   WPP Group PLC, the world's largest advertising group, last month
announced that its pre-tax profit wouldn't match analysts'
expectations of 110 million pounds, or $213 million, and the news
sent the company's share price diving.
   Neil Blackley, an advertising analyst with the London investment
firm James Capel and Co,. said, ``The outlook is very poor indeed
with the U.S. economy weakening and the economies going down in
mainland Europe and the impact on margins will be felt.''
   Saatchi's ``financial position is not good. In order to survive
the company is going to have to restructure'' debt of 176.5 million
pounds, or $342 million, he said.
   The loss for fiscal 1990 reflected an extraordinary loss of 76.9
million pounds, or $130 million, on asset disposals, property
provisions, and other expenses, compared with a loss of 58.5
million pounds on such items a year earlier.
   Pre-tax profit rose 63 percent to 35.6 million pounds, or $60
million, from 21.8 million pounds a year earlier. But the latest
results were helped by substantially reduced restructuring costs
compared with a year ago.
   The 1989 results included reorganization and streamlining of the
group's communications division plus costs from its consulting
business.
   Sales dropped 17 percent to 808.1 million pounds, or $1.37
billion, from 973.5 million pounds in fiscal 1989.
   Operating profit for its communications division fell 10 percent
to 63 million pounds, or $106 million.
   Its U.S. communications activities had a 12 percent rise in
operating profit while continental European operations posted a 25
percent gain. But the operating profit from British communications
activities fell 48 percent and in the rest of the world, it fell 72
percent.
   Saatchi said that its two remaining consulting businesses will
be sold when market conditions improve. They are Litigation
Sciences Inc. of Los Angeles and MSL International, a London-based
executive recruitment business.
   It completed the $70 million sale of Gartner Group Inc., a
Stamford, Conn.-based market information company, earlier this
year. The price was below Saatchi's original expectations.
   Saatchi's results were converted at an averaged exchange rate
for the fiscal year of $1.69 to the pound.

<HEAD>Japan's NTT Announces What It Calls World's Smallest Cellular
Phone</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese telecommunications giant Nippon Telegraph
and Telephone said Wednesday it has developed a palm-size portable
telephone that is the lightest and smallest in the world.
   The 8.1-ounce cellular phone, to be made by four Japanese
electronics companies, can carry a continuous conversation for 45
minutes, NTT said.
   New miniaturized low-power circuitry is used to cut its size to
9.2 cubic inches, compared with 13.5 cubic inches for Motorola
Inc.'s MicroTac telephone, it said.
   The MicroTac, which the U.S. company says is the world's
smallest cellular phone, weighs 10.7 ounces and can transmit for up
to 30 minutes with its slim-sized battery, and up to 100 minutes
with a slightly thicker battery, Motorola spokesman David Pinsky
said. Motorola introduced MicroTac two years ago.
   Pinsky, speaking from his company's Schaumburg, Ill.,
headquarters, said Motorola would have no comment on the NTT phone
until it receives more information on it.
   ``The new phone comes out on top in all three areas - size,
weight and battery life,'' said NTT's Kazuyoshi Terada. ``After
feeling melancholy for two years, we now can feel proud about
having the best portable phone.''
   The phone is about one-third the size and weight of the smallest
model currently marketed by NTT, Japan's main telephone company.
   It will be available in four designs containing the same
NTT-developed circuitry, each manufactured by a different Japanese
electronics firm. The four companies are NEC Corp., Matsushita
Electric, Mitsubishi Electric and Fujitsu, NTT said.
   The phone features automatic dialing, message notification by
either audio or light signals, and a selection of three different
message notification tones. It also has a built-in electronic
memory for storing up to 100 names and telephone numbers.
   NTT said it plans to begin marketing the telephone in Japan in
April. Although it will not sell the phone overseas, the companies
that participated in its development may market similar products
outside Japan in the future, Terada said.
   NTT said it was able to reduce the volume of radio parts in the
phone by about one-half by developing new high-density integrated
circuits and reducing the size of other components. However, the
phone contains two separate receivers and antennas, including one
inside the case, and can automatically pick the stronger of the two
signals to improve reception, it said.
   The phone saves battery power by automatically limiting
transmission strength to the minimum amount needed. Transmission
power is a maximum 0.6 watts, the same as in the MicroTac, NTT
said.
   The new NTT phone, like most existing cellular phones, uses
analog technology, while digital technology, which allows many more
callers to use te service at once, is considered the wave of the
future.
   Motorola's digital voice-coder technology was selected last
summer as the future Japanese national standard, a move that helped
defuse trade tensions over Japan's cellular telephone market.
   Those tensions also were eased when the Japanese government
agreed in June to allow Motorola's analog cellular technology to be
used on frequencies in the Tokyo area, which had been limited to
NTT technology.
   Previously, Motorola supplied analog cellular equipment to NTT
and other Japanese companies only outside Tokyo.

<HEAD>Lack of Progress in GATT Talks Weigh on Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed lower
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade as concern over the lack of
progress in the trade and tariff talks depressed the market.
   The lack of export business to the Soviet Union also weighed on
the market, said Dan Cekander, an analyst with Rodman &amp; Renshaw
Inc. in Chicago.
   ``The market had been pumped up over all the talk of extending
credits to the Russians,'' he said. ``(The market) remains
optimistic it will happen. But it has settled back to wait.''
   The extension of a U.S. credit package would allow the Soviet
Union to buy badly needed grain.
   Cekander said there also was concern the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade negotiations, under way in Brussels, could
collapse. The main obstacle is the demand by the United States and
other countries that the European Community reduce farm subsidies.
   Analysts say a breakdown of the talks, scheduled to end this
week, could result in a world trade war, which would hurt U.S. farm
exports.
   At the close, wheat was a { cent to 2 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $2.43{ a bushel; corn was a \
cent to 1\ cents lower with December at $2.27 a bushel; oats were 1
cent to 2\ cent lower with December at $1.10{ a bushel; soybeans
were 2{ cents to 9} cents lower with January at $5.93 a bushel.

<HEAD>Holiday Inns Acquisition Helps Bass Profit, But Outlook Cloudy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The acquisition of Holiday Inns has helped Bass
PLC post a 23 percent jump in annual profits, but the U.S. hotel
industry's downturn now is clouding the outlook for the world's
largest hotel operator.
   Bass Chairman Ian Prosser told a news conference Wednesday,
``Overall, we are finding trading conditions difficult.''
   In a statement, Prosser warned that ``unless there is a swift
change in economic conditions leading to improved business
confidence and an increase in consumer spending, we expect those
conditions to prevail for most of 1991.''
   Bryan Langton, chief executive of the company's Holiday Inn
division, told reporters that U.S. hotels have been pressured by a
slowdown in demand from both business travelers and vacationers.
   Langton cited the U.S. recession, but declined to quantify the
effect on the company.
   Bass acquired the North American assets of Holiday Corp. for
$1.98 billion in February after paying $475 million for its
international hotels in 1988.
   The second purchase was clinched as the U.S. economy slowed. A
glut of hotel rooms in the United States - whose 40,000 hotels make
it the world's largest hotel market - now is forcing operators to
cut rates to attract business.
   Langton maintained that Holiday Inns could weather a slowdown,
citing Bass' strategy of segmenting the Holiday Inn product. It has
been developing Holiday Inn Express, targeting the upper level of
the economy class, for example.
   As many as 1,450 of Bass' hotels are located in North America
rather than faster growing areas elsewhere in the world, making
Bass vulnerable.
   But Langton said that fact that 1,365 of its 1,605 hotels are
franchised rather than owned or operated will help insulate the
company.
   Bass also has better financing and is not as indebted as some of
its competitors, and Holiday Inns is a strong brand name, he said.
   ``Our relative strength gives us the opportunity to outperform
the market,'' Langton said.
   Bass said its net profit for the year ended Sept. 30 came to 470
million pounds, or $808 million, compared with 382 million pounds,
or $657 million, in the same period a year earlier.
   Earnings per share came to 109.6 pence, or $1.89, compared with
92.7 pence, or $1.59.
   Pre-tax profit rose 15 percent to 535 million pounds, or $920
million, from 465 million pounds, or $800 million.
   Revenue climbed 10.5 percent to 4.46 billion pounds, or $7.67
billion, from 4.04 billion pounds, or $6.95 billion dollars.
   The group's hotel operations saw operating profit jump 69
percent to 127 million pounds, or $218 million, from 75 million
pounds, or $129 million.
   Holiday Inns accounted for 103 million pounds, or $177 million,
of that 1990 profit. Bass didn't provide the year-ago figure.
   Langton said Holiday Inns' profit had met the company's
expectations, and he said Holiday Inns' performance improved over
the year.
   Holiday Inns occupancy rate increased 0.9 percent over the
previous year, and outperformed its competitors in the middle of
the market, he said.
   Bass' brewing operations also experienced strong growth, rising
21 percent to 177 million pounds, or $304 million, from 146 million
pounds, $251 million. Its brands include Carling Black Label, Lamot
Pils, and Tennents.
   The company said it had 108 million pounds, or $186 million, of
one-time costs because of the British government's decision to
force brewers to focus either on brewing or pub operations.
   The decision, aimed at fostering more competition in
brewer-owned pubs that sell their own beers, means Bass will have
to sell or free up 2,680 pubs by November 1992.
   Bass' 6,886 pubs make the company Britain's largest pub owner.
The company also has smaller interests in betting and soft drinks.
   Bass didn't break out results for the latest quarter or second
half of the year. It isn't required to under British law.
   The figures were converted at company-provided exchange rate of
$1.72 to the pound.

   Oil prices fell more than $3 per barrel today to
the lowest level in more than three months on news that Iraq would
discuss a peaceful solution to the Persian Gulf crisis.
   With just minutes left to trade on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, light sweet crude, the key grade of oil, was down $3.31
at $27.35 per barrel on contracts for delivery in January. The
exchange said crude had last traded below $28 per barrel for
next-month delivery on Aug. 31.
   Oil came crashing down in the afternoon when the U.S. government
said Iraq had accepted its offer for high-level diplomatic talks on
the desert standoff that began when Iraq seized neighboring Kuwait
Aug. 2.
   ``That's what pushed it through,'' said Thomas P. Blakeslee, an
energy analyst at Pegasus Econometric Group Inc., in Hoboken, N.J.
``There was some good selling at that point.''
   Earlier, oil prices were down more than $2 per barrel today on a
television report indicating negotiations might bring a peaceful
end to the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Cable News Network reported this morning that Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein was feeling enormous pressure to withdraw from
Kuwait and quoted a ranking Iraqi source it did not identify as
saying, ``All issues are on the table, everything.''
   After opening lower following Tuesday's British television
report indicating Iraq might have a plan for pulling out of Kuwait,
crude started moving up when Secretary of State James A. Baker III
warned Congress that delaying war with Iraq could be harmful,
should war become necessary.
   The CNN report then prompted crude to reverse direction, said
Christian Gohler, a broker at Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.
Contracts for oil delivery in later months were all moving down,
though not as dramatically as the January crude.
   Futures for refined petroluem products were also tumbling this
afternoon.
   Home heating oil dropped 3.25 cents to 83.65 cents a gallon on
contracts for delivery in January. Unleaded gasoline fell 4.32
cents to 71.60 cents a gallon on contracts for delivery in January.
   Oil's drop in New York followed a fall in London that came in
reaction to an unconfirmed report that Saddam may be willing to
leave most of Kuwait in exchange for a disputed oil field on their
border and a guarantee that Western forces would not attack Iraq.
   U.S. and British officials said they had heard nothing of the
proposal reported by Sky Television News, which quoted unnamed
sources close to what it called negotiations between Iraq and
senior international mediators.
   Brent crude oil, the British benchmark grade, opened about $1
lower then drifted slightly higher on January contracts as traders
refused to respond strongly to the report.
   ``They've reacted in a very placid sort of way,'' said Geoff
Pyne, an oil trader at UBS Phillips and Drew. ``If the Sky News
report was believed by the markets it would have dropped three or
four dollars.''
   ``The thing that was interesting about the Sky report - there
seemed to be so much detail ... that it was too good to be true,''
Pyne said. ``It could be some sort of a smoke screen to make the
West think he (Saddam) is going to pull out and it buys him time.''
   The Sky News report jolted traders in New York shortly after the
market closed on Tuesday, but it had apparently been discounted
this morning, at least until the CNN report was aired and the oil
pit turned bearish.

   The stock market gained more ground today,
extending its advance of the past three sessions as the price of
oil tumbled.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 60.89 points from
last Thursday through Tuesday's close, rose another 15.10 to
2,594.80 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 9 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 947 up, 538 down and
499 unchanged.
   Oil prices dropped and stocks picked up new forward momentum
after word came from the State Department that Iraq had agreed to
hold talks with President Bush on the crisis in the Persian Gulf.
   Crude oil for January delivery fell more than $3 a barrel, to
the neighborhood of $27.50 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   Stocks have also benefited of late from falling interest rates
and steps by the Federal Reserve toward an easier credit policy.
   But analysts say investors were still proceeding cautiously as
they wait for more evidence about the prospective severity of the
economic slump.
   Unsettling news is expected on Friday when the Labor Department
issues its monthly report on the employment situation.
   If advance estimates are accurate, the figures will show a drop
of as much as 100,000 in payroll employment and an increase in the
civilian unemployment rate from 5.7 percent in October to 5.8
percent or 5.9 percent in November.
   Bank stocks were strong for the second straight session
following the Fed's announcement Tuesday of a reduction in reserve
requirements on some commercial deposits.
   Citicorp gained 1&rsqb; to 15}; Chase Manhattan 1&lsqb; to 12|;
BankAmerica 1{ to 26, and Chemical Banking ~ to 13&rsqb;.
   NCR rose 2&rsqb; to 85~ and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph dropped &rsqb;
to 30. NCR has resisted takeover overtures made by AT&amp;T earlier
this week.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained 1.22 to 179.41. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up 1.53 at 304.17.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 165.89 million shares with an

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Seagram Co. Ltd. said Wednesday its profit
rose 11.2 percent in the third quarter, helped by strong
international beverage sales growth, lower orange juice costs and a
bigger dividend from the DuPont Co.
   The Montreal-based producer of liquor, wine, coolers, fruit
juices and soft drinks said it earned $189 million, or $2.01 a
share, in the three months ended Oct. 31 compared with $170
million, or $1.77 a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue rose 9.2 percent to $1.5 billion from $1.4 billion a
year earlier.
   Edgar Bronfman Jr., president and chief operating officer, said
the company had strong sales growth in its Seagram International
operation, aided by currency translations. Operating income from
the company's Tropicana division benfited from lower orange juice
costs, he said.
   The company had $66 million in dividend income from its 24.5
percent stake in the DuPont Co., up 15.8 percent from $57 million a
year earlier.
   Seagram's equity in unremitted earnings from DuPont fell 11.6
percent to $61 million from $69 million a year earlier.
   For the first nine months of the year, Seagram earned $581
million, or $6.16 a share, up 2.8 percent from $565 million, or
$5.84 a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue for the first nine months rose 7.8 percent to $4.2
billion from $3.9 billion a year earlier.
   Among Seagram's brands are Chivas Regal and The Glenlivet Scotch
whiskeys, Crown Royal and Seagram's V.O. Canadian whiskeys, Martell
Cognacs, Sterling Vineyards Wines, Seagram's Coolers and Tropicana
Pure Premium Orange Juice.

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight months after arriving at Eastern Airlines
with the cold title of court-appointed trustee, Martin R. Shugrue
has come to personify the company while taking a place in its
tradition of colorful and controversial bosses.
   Shugrue enjoys obvious support, and even admiration, from
employees at a carrier known for labor-management strife. He's also
making new friends for Eastern among travel agents and other key
industry players and, he admits, has become something of a
celebrity.
   ``I'm no shrinking violet (but) I don't like being recognized on
the street. I can't go anywhere. I can't have a private dinner in a
restaurant,'' Shugrue said. ``But it's worked for us.''
   Along the way, though, he's antagonized the Eastern creditors by
fighting off their push to liquidate the carrier.
   And he's made few friends among union leaders, who say he broke
his promise to settle the disputes leading to the March 4, 1989,
strike that nearly paralyzed Eastern and pushed it into Chapter 11
bankruptcy five days later.
   While Eastern's future remains very much in doubt, Shugrue at
least has bought time for last-ditch marketing efforts to take
effect. Last month, he persuaded the bankruptcy judge to release
another $135 million from the company's escrow account, which
Eastern says will pay operating costs through March.
   An innovative ``100 Days'' advertising campaign and subsequent
ads, based on footage of Shugrue talking with workers, passengers
and reporters, has portrayed Shugrue as a straight-talking magnetic
leader. Some Shugrue backers say he's succeeded in giving Eastern a
scrappy, positive image.
   ``Americans always like an underdog,'' said Philip Davidoff,
president of the American Society of Travel Agents. ``When you see
an underdog really fighting for so long, you say let's give them a
chance.''
   ``His presence is probably the only thing that's kept the
airline in business,'' said Helane Becker, airline analyst for
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. ``He's brought to the employees a
sense of stability ... a sense of ability, and clever insight.''
   Shugrue's personalized effort to save Eastern has brought
inevitable comparisons to the Chrysler Corp. chairman.
   ``He's out Lee Iacoccaing-Lee Iacocca,'' Davidoff said.
   Several employees mentioned the comparison in a recent mass
meeting inside an Eastern hangar.
   ``If I could get $2 billion worth of federal loan guarantees,
I'd show you a turnaround,'' Shugrue replied, referring to the
government loans to the automaker in the early 1980s.
   The employee meeting was a virtual lovefest, with many of the
workers' ``questions'' just expressions of gratitude to Shugrue.
   ``We really feel he's out to save the company,'' said
reservations agent Mario Gomez.
   James Ashlock, a vice president and 25-year veteran of the
airline, said Shugrue has for the first time given Eastern a proud,
enthusiastic workforce that believes its management wants the same
thing it does. Ashlock's past bosses at Eastern included World War
I flying ace Eddie Rickenbacker, Apollo astronaut Frank Borman and
airline entrepreneur Frank Lorenzo, who was replaced at the Eastern
helm by Shugrue.
   Shugrue, whose tenure also has seen the departure of some of
Eastern's most unpopular executives, claims he used a simple
approach, telling his managers to ``get out on the ramp and tell
the people what you expect of them.''
   ``And I did it by example, I went out and talked to employees,''
he said. ``I think (when) CEO's get into a crisis situation, the
more visible they become in taking command of the crisis, the more
successful they're going to be getting out of it.
   ``There's no secrets, no magic to it. It may be Leadership 101 -
getting in front and leading.''
   However, Shugrue agreed his feelings about Eastern are stronger
than he would have ever expected the Sunday last April when he came
out of the shower in his Houston home to take a telephone call from
bankruptcy court examiner David Shapiro. At age 50, Shugrue was
heading a successful independent consulting group.
   Nonetheless, Shugrue was well-versed about Eastern's woes. He
was a pilot and long-time executive at Pan American World Airways
and then president of Continental Airlines, Eastern's parent which
this past week sought federal bankruptcy protection.
   Taking over as trustee the same week as Shapiro's phone call,
Shugrue said he quickly found Eastern's financial situation was
even worse than he thought.
   ``We were staggered by what we found - a company bleeding to
death; horrible media, liquidation stories, advance bookings were
zero; long-range planning at Eastern was Tuesday.''
   But Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland in New York told Shugrue he
wanted Eastern saved.
   ``And a funny thing happened. In a very short amount of time, I
fell in love with 18,000 people,'' Shugrue said, saying he was
moved by the employees' dedication and willingness to sacrifice.
   Whether Shugrue would enjoy the same rapport with those who have
been on strike 21 months seems doubtful, but he said he'd like to
settle the labor disputes and insisted: ``We can convert anybody.''
   Shugrue, from working-class roots in Providence, R.I., says he
has no anti-union bias.
   The flight attendants and pilots unions ended their sympathy
strikes more than a year ago. Most flight attendants are back at
work, but only 125 union pilots have been returned and the pilots
union is battling Shugrue in federal court to get more jobs back.
   Machinists union leader Charles E. Bryan said Shugrue, who cited
``labor peace'' as a top priority when he was appointed, has only
gone through the motions of negotiating and really doesn't want to
settle.
   The Machinists say they will continue picketing, urging a
boycott of Eastern and challenging Shugrue. Graffiti painted on an
Interstate 75 overpass north of Miami, complains: ``Shugrue makes
$35,000 a month. Eastern loses $2 million a day. Is this anyway to
run an airline?''
   Meanwhile, many airline analysts praise Shugrue and his
``corporate rate'' strategy that lures business travelers with
expanded first-class service at discount fares. However, most are
skeptical about whether Eastern can survive during what appears to
be an industry shakeout. Creditors' attorney Joel Zweibel said they
believe liquidation is inevitable.
   Shugrue plays down employee pleas for him to stay past his
trusteeship. He won't answer directly on whether he would stay on
if asked by Eastern's new ownership, when that comes.
   Although rarely in short supply of self-confidence, Shugrue does
at times seem surprised at how far he's come. He chuckled when one
listener at a Fort Lauderdale civic and business club asked whether
he was interested in a screen career.
   ``I'm just an unemployed pilot trying to sell some airplane
tickets,'' he replied.

<TEXT>
   MARNE-LA-VALLEE, France (AP) - Mickey Muuse made his official
bow to the French public Wednesday, inaugurating a welcome center
for Euro-Disneyland's theme park and resort complex opening in
1992.
   Fireworks exploded above the wintery noon sky as Mickey and the
band of Disney characters greeted guests at the colorful complex
known as ``Espace Euro-Disney'' - Euro-Disney Space - an
information center to familiarize the public with the park.
   ``Espace Euro-Disney is our first real opportunity to bring the
message of this exciting project directly to our audience,'' said
Euro-Disneyland President Robert Fitzpatrick.
   Espace Euro-Disney, a fantasy-like building topped with a blue
magician's hat, sits on the edge of the construction site, 20 miles
east of Paris. It provides a glimpse of the theme park through
attraction mock-ups, a scale model of the complex, a ``Fantasia''
boutique and a preview film of the park's attractions in a viewing
room. Mickey is to make daily appearances there.
   Euro-Disneyland will be the second overseas home after Tokyo for
Mickey and the Disney clan, including Goofy, Donald Duck, and Huey,
Dewey and Louie.
   It is expected to draw visitors from all over Europe with up to
11 million visitors projected for the first year.
   Scheduled to open in the spring of 1992, Euro-Disneyland is the
core of a complex that includes a second theme park, Disney MGM
Studios-Europe, more than 18,000 hotel rooms and other facilities
that will spread into the rural hinterlands by the year 2017.
   The more than $3 billion complex, crowned by Sleeping Beauty's
Castle, will have six hotels, an entertainment center, a camping
ground and an 18-hole golf course.
   Much of the park will be covered to protect visitors from the
often inclement weather of the Paris region.
   ``We learned a lot having operated in Japan,'' said Executive
Vice President Jim Cora, who noted that the Tokyo theme park was
lacking in weather protection.
   What would an American visiting Euro-Disneyland think?
   ``I think they'd think we've reached a new level of
sophistication,'' Cora said.

   The division will be the first of IBM's business lines to be
based outside the United States, spokesman Peter Thonis said. He
said it is part of IBM's drive to become more international, and
also is a recognition of the major growth potential in European
communications equipment sales.
   The division provides hardware and software products used to
link computers in networks and to manage these networks. It also
provides products that mix voice with computer applications.
   IBM said the move from Somers to suburban London will enable the
world's largest computer company ``to better serve its customers in
the global telecommunications marketplace.''
   The move, which will involve about 120 people, is expected to be
completed by the third quarter of 1991. The division, called
Communications Systems, is headed by IBM Vice President Ellen M.
Hancock.

   Airline analysts were skeptical
Wednesday about plans by an Iowa group to raise $1.5 billion to buy
Pan American World Airways and move its headquarters to northeast
Iowa.
   ``I'd give this a long shot at occurring,'' said Robert Decker,
an analyst for Duff &amp; Phelps in Chicago. He said it would be nearly
impossible to raise the money needed for the buyout, especially in
light of Pan Am's tottering finances.
   A Waterloo-based investment group proposes to sell at least
300,000 bonds in $5,000 denominations to buy Pan Am, according to
Pan Am airline Capt. Neil Sapp, 51, of Miami. That would be
equivalent to borrowing half the annual state budget for Iowa.
   Speaking Tuesday in Waterloo at a luncheon attended by 175
northeast Iowa business and government officials, Sapp said the
effort should not be taken lightly.
   ``We would like to make a solid offer in January,'' he said.
``We're not crazy; we're just innovative.''
   Sapp and Samual Nodarse of Cedar Falls, a retired University of
Northern Iowa professor, formed the Iowa Acquisition Group and said
they would buy the company on condition that its headquarters move
from New York to Waterloo.
   ``We're the white hats, the good guys,'' Sapp said. ``We're not
just someone who wants to buy it for its assets, then run away from
it with the profits from that.''
   He said money raised through the sale of bonds would be invested
with Iowa banks, primarily in certificates of deposit, with the
interest used to pay off loans from investment bankers. Investors
would get interest when bonds mature in nine years.
   Sapp predicted a ``very high probability of success.''
   Spokeswoman Pam Hanlon at Pan Am's headquarters in New York said
company policy is to decline comment on reports of mergers and
acquisitions. Industry analysts disagreed with Sapp's prediction.
   ``In today's market, it would be difficult to raise that kind of
money for an airline like Pan Am,'' Decker. ``We're in a period
where debt markets are cautious and conservative.
   ``There's not a lot of funds available nd Pan Am would
certainly be a high risk company to do a buyout on at this stage.''
he said.
   Thomas Canning, who follows airlines for Standard &amp; Poors Corp.
in New York, said, ``Selling the bonds might be difficult. And I
don't know what Pan Am might say about it. They've been looking for
a buyer for two years and have not been able to make a deal.
   ``I don't want to say there's no chance, but it's a little
wild,'' Canning said. ``It's been difficult finding somebody
interested in buying the whole company.''
   Pan Am has been losing money for years. It recently agreed to
sell key London routes and some other assets to Chicago-based UAL
Corp., parent of United Airlines, for $400 million.

<HEAD>Crayola Has Another Surprise: Top Crayon Maker Colorblind</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBs 4th graf to include Moser's title and add that the

<DATELINE>STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crayola company officials might be
turning a little red, make that fuchsia, with news that its top
crayon maker is colorblind.
   Emerson Moser, who is retiring next week after 35 years, isn't
colorblind in the sense that he can't see color at all. It's just
that some colors are confusing to him.
   That means trying to spot the difference between a cadet blue
and a blue green can make him feel, well, like a shrinking violet.
   ``If you have a serious case of it, you could foul up a lot of
materials,'' said Moser, 63, who has made a record 1.4 billion
crayons. His title at Binney &amp; Smith Co., the official name of the
company that makes Crayolas, is a crayon molder.
   As far as Moser and the company can tell, there's been no threat
of children coloring the sky green and the grass blue - unless they
were doing their Andy Warhol imitations.
   ``He's blue-green colorblind, but despite his handicap, he's
gone to the top of his trade,'' said Brad Drexler, spokesman for
the Easton-based company.
   Moser has made seas of salmon, pecks of plums and is a king
crayon craftsman, Drexler said. Tuesday, Moser made yards of yellow
and Wednesday, it was oodles of orange - colors that give Moser no
trouble.
   ``When you have shades of one color, you get a little doubt
about it. Before you go do anything, you double-check yourself,''
said Moser.
   It's the second technicolor shock to come out of the Crayola
plant this year. In August, it retired eight traditional colors
into the Crayola Hall of Fame.
   The company is asking Moser to donate his final pair of
ankle-high boots, splashed with the waxy colorful remains of his
time on the job, for inclusion in the hall.
   ``The colors splash a little bit when it comes out of the kettle
into the bucket,'' said Moser. ``People daily clean their shoes,
but I don't. I have a multicolored pair of shoes. It's probably
made them waterproof.
   ``This pair I have now ... there's yellow on them, because I
worked yellow today, and some orange and some red,'' Moser said in
a telephone interview Tuesday.
   A company doctor detected Moser's slight vision problem during a
physical conducted when he was hired Oct. 12, 1953, as a floor boy
in the packing department.
   ``It's so slight that if the doctor wouldn't have tested me, I
probably would have never noticed it,'' Moser said.
   Less than two years later, Moser graduated to the most colorful
job in the world, pouring molten wax into 2,400-crayon molds nearly
100 times a day. Once the wax is set, crayons are flicked out of
the racks and stacked in a bin for a conveyor belt to carry them to
a labeling machine.
   At Crayola, there are subtle shades of everything.
   But can anyone over age 12 really tell the difference between
violet and blue violet, cornflower and navy blue, blue green and
cadet blue, sepia and brown, orchid and thistle, or mulberry and
red violet?
   Other colors to worry about are the new shades of cerulean (a
type of blue), dandelion, fuchsia, jungle green, royal purple, teal
blue, vivid tangerine and wild strawberry. They replaced blue gray,
green blue, lemon yellow, maize, orange red, orange yellow, raw
umber and violet blue last summer.
   For less than obvious reasons, Moser likes the eight basic
Crayola colors: black, white, red, yellow, green, blue, brown and
orange. He even liked the eight retired colors, which now are
remembered only in 5-foot-tall models at the hall of fame.
   But Moser says there is no reason to wax nostalgic about
retiring the crayon colors.
   ``The new ones are nice. They really stand out when you color
with them,'' Moser said. ``The other colors were nice, too. You
grew up with them and got used to them, but you can't survive on
sentiment. Sentiment doesn't keep a company moving forward.''

<TEXT>
   Factory orders for manufactured goods bounced
up 2.8 percent in October, the government reported Wednesday, but
analysts said the jump mostly was due to the transportation sector
and the higher cost of oil.
   ``The October numbers are about as good as the factory orders
are going to look for awhile,'' said economist Robert Brusca of
Nikko Securities Co. International in New York. Like many analysts,
he believes the economy is in a recession.
   ``The strength was mostly in aircraft and in non-durable price
increases,'' added Cynthia Latta, an economist with DRI-McGraw-Hill
in Lexington, Mass. ``I don't see any reason to become particularly
hopeful on the basis of this report.''
   The Commerce Department said orders for both durable and
non-durable goods totaled a seasonally adjusted $250.7 billion
after a revised 0.2 percent decline the previous month. The
revision showed September orders even weaker than the 0.1 percent
gain initially reported.
   Transportation orders jumped 14.8 percent to $37.9 billion,
reflecting gains in both the aircraft and automobile industries.
But aircraft orders tend to be volatile and analysts pointed to
reports that car production was falling at the end of November.
   ``Discounting transportation, orders rose just a modest 0.9
percent,'' noted economist Thomas Runiewicz of the WEFA Group in
Bala Cynwyd, Pa.
   Factory orders are a key economic barometer of the manufacturing
industry. A decrease may forecast a slump in that sector and future
job layoffs.
   Durable goods - products like autos that are expected to last
more than three years - were up 3.9 percent to $129.8 billion after
dropping 1.6 percent in September and 0.9 percent in August.
   But Brusca said October total still was below the $131.7 billion
level reached last December and added: ``The orders situation is
really pretty bleak.''
   Indeed, a survey by the National Association of Purchasing
Management on Monday said its index of new manufacturing orders
dropped to 39.4 percent in November - the lowest level since it
stood at 38.1 percent in May 1982 during the last recession.
   Forty-three percent of the purchasing managers surveyed said
their firms had fewer new orders in November. Only 18 percent said
their orders increased and 39 percent said they were unchanged from
October.
   Non-durable goods orders rose 1.6 percent to $120.9 billion,
with the largest increase in petroleum refining, the department
said. The price of oil bounced above $40 a barrel at one point
during October but since has fallen back.
   One possible bright spot was in the key category of non-military
capital goods, often a barometer of business investment plans.
Orders there gained 8.7 percent to $41.6 billion following a 6.8
percent advance in September.
   The often-volatile defense orders fell for the second straight
month, down 9.4 percent to $7.1 billion following a 6.1 percent
decline a month earlier. Excluding the defense component, orders
were up 3.2 percent.
   Orders for other durable goods included primary metals, up 5.5
percent to $12.0 billion, and electrical machinery, up 3.1 percent
to $19.8 billion. But non-electrical machinery orders were down 1.5
percent to $22.2 billion,
   Inventories inched up 0.1 percent to $377.3 billion. Shipments
gained 1.7 percent to $247.5 billion and unfilled orders were up
0.6 percent to $522.5 billion.

<HEAD>Dollar Mixed, Gold Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar turned in a mixed performance
Wednesday as foreign exchange traders anxiously watched the Middle
East situation and the U.S. economy.
   Gold prices declined.
   ``The markets are still very nervous about peace, war, peace,
war'' and the dollar has fluctuated accordingly, said Robert Ryan,
corporate foreign exchange manager with Bank of New York Co.
   The dollar advanced against most major currrencies in Europe
after Secretary of State James Baker reiterated demands for Iraq's
withdrawal from Kuwait.
   Baker told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee the United
States would strike ``suddenly, massively and decisively'' if
military force is needed to remove Iraqi troops from Kuwait.
   The dollar has gained in recent weeks amid signs that Middle
East tensions were increasing. But it has also fallen as those
tensions seemed to dissipate or as the markets had second thoughts
about how serious the situation really is.
   The dollar generally advances during times of international
turmoil because some investors view it as a safe-haven currency.
   But the dollar was held down Wednesday by the faltering U.S.
economy and the belief that interest rates in this country will
fall.
   A Federal Reserve survey released Wednesday showed the economy
in all regions of the country was either declining or growing
sluggishly at the end of last month.
   Traders believe the Fed will be forced to lower interest rates.
That would be a negative for the dollar, which like all currencies
is supported by higher rates.
   In New York trading, the dollar advanced against the British
pound and the Japanese yen.
   Sterling fell to $1.9260 in New York from $1.92925 late Tuesday.
In earlier London trading, the pound fell to $1.9225 from $1.9350.
   The pound is also facing the prospects of lower interest rates.
   The dollar rose to 133.625 yen in New York from 133.30 late
Tuesday. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar fell 0.93 yen to 133.42
yen, and it was quoted later in London at a higher rate of 133.95
yen.
   The Japanese economy is seen as particularly vulnerable should
war break out in the Midle East and disrupt oil supplies. Japan
imports nearly all its oil.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Tuesday's prices, included: 1.49925 German marks, down from 1.5030;
1.2795 Swiss francs, down from 1.2825; 5.0770 French francs, down
from 5.0825; 1,127.685 Italian lire, down from 1,129.25; and
1.16295 Canadian dollars, down from 1.16325.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe compared with late rates
Tuesday included: 1.5025 West German marks, up from 1.4942; 1.2835
Swiss francs, up from 1.2750; 5.0898 French francs, up from 5.0570;
1.6955 Dutch guilders, up from 1.6933; 1,130.75 Italian lire, up
from 1,124.00, and 1.1623 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1632.
   In New York, gold fell $4.70 to $374.20 on the Commodity
Exchange, and Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $372.75,
down $3.50.
   Gold fell earlier in London to a late bid of $372.65 a troy
ounce from $378.20 late Tuesday. In Zurich, the metal fell to a
closing bid of $374.50 an ounce from $377.40 late Tuesday.
   In Hong Kong, gold rose 95 cents an ounce to $377.04.
   Silver fell 0.3 cent in New York to $4.148 a troy ounce on the
Commodity Exchange. The metal fell in London to a late bid of $4.16
a troy ounce, down from $4.18 late Tuesday.

<HEAD>Kodak Seeking Joint Venture for Sterling Drugs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastman Kodak Co. is talking with several
companies about forming a joint venture with its Sterling Drug
subsidiary, officials said Wednesday.
   Kodak spokesman Paul Allen confirmed that French pharmaceutical
giant Sanofi S.A. is among the companies with which Kodak is
negotiating.
   ``Sterling has been talking to several companies about an
alliance, and Sanofi is a company that Sterling is talking to,''
   But Allen said no agreement had been reached ``and there's no
assurance that any will.'' He would not comment on other companies
with which Sterling is talking or what kind of joint venture is
being sought.
   Sterling makes Bayer aspirin, Phillips' milk of magnesia, Midol
pain relievers and other over-the-counter products. Its
best-selling prescription drug is Omnipaque, which highlights body
organs during X-rays and CAT scans.
   Kodak acquired Sterling for $5.1 billion in 1988, hoping the
drug company would help offset sluggish growth in the photography
business. Analysts have expressed dissatisfaction with Sterling's
failure to produce new drugs or the kind of profits Kodak had
expected.
   But Allen said the negotiations do not reflect unhappiness with
Sterling's performance.
   ``They're right on target. Their performance is right on plan,''
he said. ``We said they would be contributing to the cash flow by
the end of 1989 and they are.''
   Kodak President Kay Whitmore has said the company won't sell
Sterling or buy another pharmaceutical company, but would look for
other ways to improve Sterling's performance.
   The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that sources close to
the talks said an agreement between Sanofi and Sterling could be
reached by the end of the year. Allen would not comment on a
timetable for the talks.
   The newspaper said a number of other pharmaceutical companies
may be considering a joint venture with Sterling, including F.
Hoffmann-La Roche &amp; Co., Ciba-Geigy AG and Sandoz AG, all based in
Switzerland; Bayer AG of Germany; and Rhone-Poulenc S.A. of France.
   If Sterling and Sanofi create a joint venture, Sterling probably
would market a number of Sanofi drugs in the United States, and at
the same time get a larger share of overseas markets, the Journal
said.
   The newspaper said Sanofi, which is 60 percent owned by France's
state-controlled Elf Aquitaine oil company, has been looking for a
U.S. distribution network to launch several drugs in the mid-1990s.

<HEAD>IEA: OPEC's November Oil Output Down 1.2 Pct from Pre-Invasion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   OPEC's crude oil production was down 1.2 percent
in November from levels before Iraq invaded Kuwait, the
International Energy Agency reported Wednesday.
   The 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
produced 22.9 million barrels a day in November, despite the U.N.
embargo against oil produced by Iraq and Kuwait, both OPEC members,
the agency said in a report released in London.
   The November figure was 300,000 barrels per day less than in
July, just before the Iraqi invasion, and up 600,000 barrels a day
from October, the report said.
   The IEA said that among OPEC producers, Saudi Arabia's output
was 7.9 millions of barrels a day, an increase of about 300,000
barrels a day over October.
   Iran boosted production to 3.3 million barrels a day, up 400,000
barrels a day from October, the report said.
   Iraq produced 400,000 barrels a day and Kuwait prodced 100,000
barrels a day, despite the worldwide ban on importing oil from the
two countries.
   The Paris-based organization said increases in production came
from greater output in heavier, high-sulphur grades.
   World oil supplies outside countries with centrally planned
economies totaled 53.8 million barrels a day in November, up from
the revised October total of 53.2 million barrels a day, the IEA
said.
   That was the second monthly rise since levels were depressed in
August and September, following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug.
2.
   Production in Western countries that are members of the
24-nation Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
rose slightly to 16.1 million barrels a day, mostly from increases
in North Sea and Australian output. Oil producers within the OECD
include the United States, Britain and Norway.
   Soviet oil exports suffered a larger-than-expected seasonal
drop. After averaging about 1.7 million barrels a day during the
first nine months of the year, Soviet crude exports to the OECD
countries have dropped to about 1.4 million barrels a day since
September, the agency reported.
   The IEA said the normal seasonal drop of Soviet exports to the
OECD in the fourth quarter of the year to meet rising winter
domestic demand was this year reinforced by falling output and a
drop in deliveries to eastern Europe, caught in a hard currency
crunch.
   ``Soviet deliveries to all destinations from the Black Sea ports
in October were at the lowest level since January and early
indications suggest a further fall to less than 0.9 million barrels
a day in November,'' the agency said.
   Outside the OECD, the IEA expects oil consumption to average
15.3 million barrels a day, up from 1989's level of 14.7 million
barrels a day. It projects oil consumption for the world outside
the centrally planned economy countries to average 53.1 million
barrels a day, an increase of 800,000 barrels a day from its 1989
level.

   The stock market swept ahead to a 12-week high
Wednesday, extending its yearend rally as the price of oil tumbled.
   Banking and other financial issues paced the advance.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 30.70 to
2,610.40, bringing its gain over the past four sessions to 91.59
points.
   That marked the highest close for the average since it stood at
2,625.74 on Sept. 12.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,087 up, 485 down and 446 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board reached 205.82 million
shares, up from 185.82 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 252.68 million shares.
   Oil prices dropped, and stocks picked up fresh forward momentum,
after word came from the State Department that Iraq had agreed to
hold talks with President Bush on the crisis in the Persian Gulf.
   Crude oil for January delivery fell more than $3 a barrel, to
the neighborhood of $27.50 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   Stocks have also benefited of late from falling interest rates
and steps by the Federal Reserve toward an easier credit policy.
But analysts said investors were still proceeding cautiously as
they wait for more evidence about the prospective severity of the
economic slump.
   Unsettling news is expected on Friday when the Labor Department
issues its monthly report on the employment situation.
   If advance estimates are accurate, the figures will show a drop
of as much as 100,000 in payroll employment and an increase in the
civilian unemployment rate from 5.7 percent in October to 5.8
percent or 5.9 percent in November.
   Bank stocks were strong for the second straight session
following the Fed's announcement Tuesday of a reduction in reserve
requirements on some commercial deposits.

   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000

<HEAD>Gold Futures Plunge on Increased Prospects Mideast Negotiations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold futures prices plunged Wednesday on New York's Commodity
Exchange on perceptions that developments favor a negotiated
settlement of the crisis caused by Iraq's occupation of Kuwait.
   Also helping to push gold lower was the steep plunge in crude
oil prices, with the January contract down $3.37 a barrel.
   On other markets, grains and soybeans fell and livestock and
pork futures climbed.
   Gold prices began their plunge on reports from Paris that French
Foreign Minister Randolph Dumas said the permanent members of the
U.N. Security Council would meet soon to discuss a Mideast peace
plan.
   An announcement by the State Department that Iraq accepted
President Bush's offer to hold talks on the Persian Gulf crisis
reinforced peace sentiments.
   ``Perception that developments in Middle East favor negotiation
rather than otherwise, sent gold prices down sharply,'' said Bette
Raptopoulos, an analyst with Prudential Bache Securities Inc. in
New York.
   Ms. Raptopoulos said the possibility of a peaceful solution to
the crisis sent crude oil prices plunging, adding to the selloff in
gold.
   Investors usually buy gold during periods of uncertainty because
its value is universally accepted.
   Ms. Raptopoulos noted that platinum and silver suffered minor
losses.
   ``The end of a war situation will be good for platinum and
silver because those are industrial metal,'' she said.
   Gold settled $4.60 to $4.80 lower with the contract for delivery
in February at $375.80 a troy ounce; silver was 3 cents to 6 cents
lower with March at $4.238 a troy ounce.
   Crude oil prices plunged on New York's Mercantile Exchange on
word of the various diplomatic moves.
   Analysts said oil prices also were influenced by reports from
energy experts of ample supply of oil in coming months. And they
say a report expected from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Counties indicating demand for oil will decline in coming months
added to the bearish tone of the market.
   Light sweet crude was 84 cents to $3.37 lower with January at
$27.29 a barrel; heating oil was 4 cents to 5.76 cents lower with
January at 81.14 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 4.55 cents
to 7.08 cents lower with January at 68.84 cents a gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed lower on the Chicago
Board of Trade as concern over the lack of progress in the trade
and tariff talks depressed the market.
   The lack of export business to the Soviet Union also weighed on
the market, said Dan Cekander, an analyst with Rodman &amp; Renshaw
Inc. in Chicago.
   ``The market had been pumped up over all the talk of extending
credits to the Russians,'' he said. ``(The market) remains
optimistic it will happen. But it has settled back to wait.''
   The extension of a U.S. credit package would allow the Soviet
Union to buy badly needed grain. Paul Dickerson, the Agriculture
Department's general sales manager, said Wednesday the decision on
whether to grant export credit guarantees to the Soviets is still
under review.
   Cekander said there also was concern the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade negotiations, under way in Brussels, could
collapse. The main obstacle is the demand by the United States and
other countries that the European Community reduce farm subsidies.
   Analysts say a breakdown of the talks, scheduled to end this
week, could result in a world trade war, which would hurt U.S. farm
exports.
   Wheat was a { cent to 1} cents lower with December at $2.43{ a
bushel; corn was 1\ cent lower to a\ cents higher with December at
$2.27 a bushel; oats were 1{ cents to 2{ cents lower with December
at $1.10 a bushel; soybeans were 2{ cents to 9{ cents lower with
January at $5.92{ a bushel.
   Livestock futures climbed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange as
cash prices held firm, while pork futures were higher on the
perception that Tuesday's sharp selloff was overdone.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .47 cents higher with December at
79.07 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .40 cent
higher with January at 87.72 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent
to .75 cent higher with December at 49.62 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .17 cent to .45 cent higher with February at
64.10 cent a pound.

   New York investor Saul Steinberg, once a major
holder of the stock of UAL Corp., has again bought into the parent
company of United Airlines, according to documents disclosed
Wednesday.
   A subsidiary of a Steinberg family-controlled concern, Reliance
Group Holdings Inc., disclosed in a filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission that it has purchased 451,000 shares of UAL
common stock.
   The filing, covering the quarter ending Sept. 30, disclosed that
the subsidiary - Reliance Financial Services Corp. - paid more than
$43.9 million for the shares.
   But the document is not required disclose exactly where or when
the purchases were made.
   ``As a policy, we don't comment on our investment,'' said Brian
Martin, a spokesman for New York-based Reliance.
   In Chicago, UAL spokesman Joe Hopkins also declined comment.
   Steinberg was a big investor in UAL stock before an employee
buyout plan fell through in October 1989.

<HEAD>Paul Pursues Appeal as Regulators Set New Bond Deadline</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATHERINE WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorneys prepared an emergency appeal Wednesday to
keep thrift regulators from seeking a $30.8 million bond from
ousted CenTrust Chairman David Paul, a symbol of wasteful opulence
in the savings &amp; loan crisis.
   Paul, whose lavish ways propelled him into the public eye, has
been a target of regulators since they took over Florida's one-time
largest thrift in February at an estimated loss of $1.8 billion.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision, which charged that Paul
surrounded himself with luxury ``to satisfy his insatiable greed
and vanity,'' sought the huge bond to prevent him from squandering
money from the failed CenTrust.
   The government initially set a Nov. 1 deadline for payment of
the bond, but Paul won some time by challenging the administrative
order in U.S. District Court. His arguments were rejected Tuesday,
and OTS set a new deadline of noon Thursday.
   But Steve Davis, a Paul attorney, said Wednesday that an appeal
was being prepared for the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Atlanta.
   Paul's attorneys charged the government was forcing him to pay
restitution without a way to defend himself against claims he used
bank funds for his personal use, but U.S. District Judge Edward
Davis rejected those arguments.
   The judge upheld the application of the 1989 S&amp;L bailout law
against Paul, rejected arguments that OTS was improperly pursuing
enforcement actions without benefit of due process or trial, and
cited an ``important governmental interest'' in protecting
depositors' interests.
   ``The ruling is clear. The constitutional arguments were
completely without merit,'' OTS attorney Faith Hochberg said in a
telephone interview from Jersey City, N.J. ``We believe it was a
proper order from the beginning and have followed proper judicial
proceedings throughout.''
   OTS wants Paul to post the $30.8 million bond, file an
accounting of his assets and seek OTS approval of any change of
personal assets involving $5,000 or more.
   Among questionable CenTrust spending cited by OTS are a $15
million legal defense fund for thrift officers and directors,
CenTrust's sumptuously appointed 47-story office tower in downtown
Miami, Old Masters paintings and a private dinner cooked by
European chefs flown in for the occasion.

<HEAD>Report: US Must Get Serious About Computer Security Before It's Too
Late</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: INSERTS grafs 14-15: ``A ``virus,'' to explain computer terms</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   So far, the country has been lucky. There have
been viruses, worms, logic bombs, Trojan Horses and other computer
scams but no successful, systematic attempt to subvert the systems
that are so essential to modern society.
   However, says an expert on computer security, ``there is reason
to believe our luck may soon run out unless we take action now.''
   A committee of the National Research Council spent 1{ years
looking into the state of computer security and found systems and
information in danger, and society, in turn, at risk. It issued a
300-page report Wednesday, titled ``Computers at Risk.''
   ``We have in many cases left computer systems unprotected from a
wide variety of current and future threats to their integrity,''
committee chairman David D. Clark told a news conference.
   ``National computing and communications systems are vulnerable
to potentially catastrophic ecurity breaches and accidental
failures,'' he said. Contending that the nation has been lucky, he
said, ``The committee concludes that tomorrow will not be like
yesterday.''
   Horrible examples abound:
   -For 10 months in the mid-1980s, a West German nicknamed ``Wily
Hacker'' attacked 450 computers operated by the U.S. military and
its contractors, successfully gaining access to 30. He allegedly
had ties to the Soviet KGB, the NRC report says, and it was assumed
he was looking for sensitive data.
   -In 1988 a ``worm'' paralyzed thousands of computers in the
Internet, a network that links 60,000 computer systems used in
university and other research. Robert Morris of Arnold, Md., is
appealing his conviction in federal court for unleashing the
program.
   -A software design error froze much of American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph's long distance network.
   -The German Chaos Computer Club broke into the NASA Space
Physics Analysis Network.
   -An error in computer software controlling a radiation therapy
machine, a Therac 25 linear accelerator, resulted in at least three
patient deaths.
   -More than 26,000 diskettes that featured AIDS prevention
information but were infected with a hidden computer virus were
mailed to hospitals, businesses and government agencies worldwide.
   There have been thousands of reported virus attacks and hundreds
of different viruses identified, such as Stoned, Devil's Dance,
1260, Jerusalem, Yankee Doodle, Pakistani Brain, Icelandic-2, Ping
Pong and December 24, the committee said.
   A ``virus'' is a computer program, usually hidden, that attaches
itself to other programs and has the ability to reproduce itself.
Viruses generally are ``Trojan Horse'' programs which, when
executed, result in undesired side effects unexpected by the user.
``Logic bombs'' are Trojan horses activated by a particular event
in the computer, perhaps even the occurrence of a particular date.
   A ``worm'' is a program that distributes itself in multiple
copies within a system or into connected systems. A worm attack
might exploit security vulnerabilities in a system or cause denial
of service to the computer user.
   Clark said the committee, which had 16 members from
universities, industry, computer manufacturers and security firms,
is concerned about a blase attitude among most in the U.S. business
community.
   ``Many people still use easy-to-guess passwords such as their
first name, or they use common English words that can be `guessed'
by a determined hacker with a computerized dictionary,'' he said.
``Attacks based on these weaknesses are commonplace today.''
   The committee recommended six key actions, a major one being
creation of a private, non-profit organization to develop system
security principles, supporting research, maintain a tracking
system of threats and foster training of computer security agents.
   ``The modern thief can steal more with a computer than with a
gun,'' the NRC report says. ``Tomorrow's terrorist may be able to
do more damage with a keyboard than with a bomb.
   ``Thus far we have relied on the absence of malicious people who
are both capable and motivated. We can no longer do so. We must
instead attempt to build computer systems that are secure and
trustworthy.''

<HEAD>Jury Takes Dixon Bank Fraud Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal jury began deliberations Wednesday but
reached no verdict in the bank fraud trial of Don R. Dixon, who
owned the Texas savings and loan that was one of the first costly
failures of the thrift crisis.
   Vernon Savings Association collapsed in 1987 at a cost to
taxpayers of more than $1.2 billion.
   Dixon, who owned Vernon from 1981 to 1986, was charged in 38
counts with misusing thousands f dollars of the thrift's money for
political contributions, a California beach home and prostitutes.
The combined charges carried a maximum penalty of up to 190 years
in prison and fines of up to $9.5 million.
   In closing arguments, attorneys on both sides urged jurors to
focus on legal questions presented in the case, not on the savings
and loan crisis.
   U.S. District Judge A. Joe Fish then read more than 40 pages of
instructions before the eight-woman, four-man jury began
considering more than five weeks of testimony. The jury was out
part of the afternoon before quitting deliberations for the day.
   Government attorneys portrayed Dixon as a ``master manipulator''
of Vernon and its employees. Assistant U.S. Attorney David Jarvis
told jurors the case was a ``classic story of power and wealth that
caused Don Dixon to lose his moral bearings.''
   Dixon schemed and used sham documents to render the disputed
dealings unaccountable to regulators and its board of directors,
Jarvis said. ``If these are legitimate deals, why wouldn't (Dixon)
put them on the table?'' he asked.
   Defense attorney Billy Ravkind said prosecutors, through their
choice of witnesses, had ``embraced people even a child would know
are lying.''
   He called the government's investigation of Dixon ``sloppy'' and
said it focused on ``a few minor transactions in a
multibillion-dollar business.''
   The 38-count indictment was a ``script'' that prosecutors had to
act out, Ravkind said.
   Jarvis said Dixon's defense focused on which ``drawers from the
cash register'' the thrift owner got his money.
   ``What's he doing in the register? What is Don Dixon doing
tapping Vernon's till?'' the prosecutor asked.
   Government attorneys brought more than 20 witnesses to the stand
and introduced hundreds of documents over four weeks. Dixon and a
handful of others testified in his defense during the last week.
   Dixon testified that Vernon employees were responsible for the
crimes for which he is accused. He said he had no knowledge of
illegal activity at the thrift.
   Dixon said the beach house near San Diego was used as a hotel by
the thrift's owners. He said he knew escorts were hired for parties
attended by Vernon officers and borrowers at the house, but said he
did not know who paid for them.
   In testimony about trips on which thrift officers took Linton
Bowman, former commissioner of the Texas Savings and Loan
Department, Dixon said he helped arrange for a female Vernon
employee to be a date for Bowman. Providing the date was ``probably
inappropriate, but at the time I did not think so,'' Dixon
testified.

   the discussions are on the verge of breaking down.
   ``It is a stalemate and it is serious,'' said a grim-faced U.S.
Trade Representative Carla Hills.
   Officials said there would be another effort at a breakthrough
Thursday.
   ``High noon is tomorrow (Thursday),'' said Canadian Trade
Minister John Crobie. ``If there is no change, then it is over.''
   The trade ministers emerged just before midnight from a two-hour
meeting in which they sought in vain for a compromise position on
the expensive subsidies that developed countries pay to their
farmers.
   An Indian official, Commerce Minister Subramanian Swamy, was
pessimistic, saying, ``It looks like they are heading for
suspension.''
   If the talks are broken off, even for a brief time, it would put
the entire four-year effort at trade reform in jeopardy because of
the tight deadlines negotiators had faced to submit a completed
document to the U.S. Congress.
   The dispute pitted the 12-nation European Community against much
of the rest of the world, including large farm exporters such as
the United States, Brazil and Argentina.
   European officials had been expected Wednesday to agree to at
least a modest expansion of their offer to reduce internal farm
support payments by 30 percent.
   Instead, the Europeans emerged from their separate meeting
saying they had decided to make no further offer on farm subsidies
until the United States made compromises on other issues.
   There had also been hope that the European position might change
as a result of a meeting Wednesday night in Paris between German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President Francois Mitterrand.
   But following that discussion, no new offer was announced.
   Crosbie described the mood inside the discussions as ``somber''
and said the meeting Thursday would determine whether there was any
point in continuing the talks.
   ``We are going to have to decide whether we are going to give it
all up or not,'' he said.
   The farm subsidy fight evolved as the biggest stumbling block to
conclusion of the most ambitious round of trade liberalization
talks ever undertaken. The negotiations, known as the Uruguay Round
for the country where they began in 1986, had been scheduled to
wrap up Friday after five days of marathon bargaining.
   But after three days the talks remained stalemated and some
delegations talked openly about the possibility of giving up and
going home.
   ``The United States has got to recognize that this is a
negotiation between equals, not a group of people to be pushed
around in this way,'' said British Agriculture Secretary John
Gummer.
   Otto Schlecht, Germany's deputy economics minister, said, ``We
have no reason to go to the Americans on our knees.''
   Gummer said the Europeans had insisted on American compromise
offers in areas including trade in services, textiles and
investment to be made at the same time that discussions went
forward on the farm issue. He said the U.S. side had rejected that
proposal.
   U.S. officials said the Europeans were engaging in a desperate
attempt to shift the blame for failure of the negotiations.
   ``What is holding up the negotiations here is that the European
Community has not yet provided a proposal on agriculture,'' U.S.
Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said.
   The European Community entered the negotiations offering to trim
domestic farm support payments by 30 percent. The United States,
supported by major farm exporting countries, was seeking much
deeper cuts of 75 percent in domestic supports and import barriers
and a 90 percent cut in export subsidies.
   The trade talks, the eighth in a series of negotiations dating
to 1947, offered the promise of lowering prices for consumers while
at the same time boosting economic prosperity, especially in Third
World countries with farm-based economies.
   The United States has argued that without sufficient progress in
agriculture, developed nations will not be able to win concessions
from Third World countries to reform their trade practices
including agreement on tough new rules to protect against copyright
piracy, something that costs American businesses an estimated $60
billion in lost sales annually.
   Negotiators spoke pessimistically about a failure of the talks,
which many fear could trigger a rise of protectionism and global
trade wars, similar to the events of the 1930s that were blamed for
making the Great Depression more severe.
   ``Anyone who does not admit that the round is in deep crisis is
just deluding themselves,'' said Australian Trade Minister Neal
Blewett.

   Government-run Canadian Broadcasting Corp.
announced a major reduction in operations Wednesday, including the
reduction of 1,100 jobs.
   The radio and television broadcasting company said a budget
shortfall of 108 million Canadian dollars, or about $93 million,
for the fiscal year starting April 1 forced it to take the austere
steps.
   Besides the job cutbacks, CBC said it would close three
stations, in Toronto; Goose Bay, Labrador; and Matane, Quebec. In
addition, CBC said it will reduce the operations of eight other
stations and could not longer finance the cost of operating Radio
Canada international, a short-wave service.
   The Canadian government said it would seek alternate ways of
maintaining the international radio service.
   CBC said no layoffs of regular employees were contemplated
before April 1.

   Maxicare Health Plans Inc. said Wednesday it
had emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization profitable
and at half its old size.
   The health maintenance organization said it made money in
quarter ending Sept. 30, its first profitable quarter in four
years.
   ``Our company is viable because we focused on the basics of
arranging for accessible quality health care at a reasonable
costs,'' Maxicare Chairman Peter J. Ratican said in statement.
   Maxicare's recovery includes signing up such firms as Bank of
America Corp., Price Waterhouse, Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., and Stanford
University, the firm said.
   Maxicare operates in California, Indiana, Illinois, Louisiana,
North Carolina, South Carolina and Wisconsin. It filed Chapter 11
reorganization plans 21 months ago. Within a year after the filing,
it sold or closed plans with more than half its original
membership.
   The U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana, Calif., confirmed the
reorganization plan on Aug. 31.
   The plan calls for creditors and shareholders to receive about
$130 million in cash, 10-year notes at 13.5 percent interest with a
face value of about $67 million, and common stock and options.
   More than half of the HMO's creditors and shareholders approved
the proposal. Forty-nine percent of the restructured company will
be owned by medical facilities and doctors.

   George Herscu, one of Australia's
richest men until his Hooker Corp. fell on hard times, was
convicted Thursday on corruption charges.
   The 62-year-old Romania native was found guilty of paying
$77,000 in 1983 to a Queensland state cabinet minister to try to
ease access restrictions to a failing shopping center.
   Herscu had pleaded not guilty to two charges of official
corruption. He claimed he made the two $28,500 payments to Russ
Hinze, who at the time was a state minister for roads, to buy him
two racehorses.
   The now-bankrupt Herscu appeared unmoved as the Brisbane
District Court jury delivered its verdict at the end of a four-week
trial. Sentencing was scheduled for Friday.
   A Romanian Jew, Herscu worked in Nazi labor camps during World
War II until being liberated by the Soviet Army in 1944. He moved
to Australia in 1950.
   As a 25-year-old in 1953, Herscu bought one small grocery store
then others, including one at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics. In 1959,
he went into property development.
   In 1986, Herscu took over Hooker Corp., Australia's premier
property developer with substantial U.S. interests. He took out
loans and spent $1 billion, in part on up-market American
retailers, including Bonwit Teller.
   The U.S. subsidiary, L.J. Hooker Corp., has disposed of the bulk
of its retail holdings acquired since 1986, including Bonwit Teller
and other department store chains.
   After being steered into shopping-center developments in the
United States, Hooker grounded on a $1.5 billion debt in July 1989.
Both Hooker and Herscu's personal company, Hersfield Developments
Corp., went into liquidation.
   In July, Herscu and his wife, Sheila, declared themselves
bankrupt. The move came two days before a bankruptcy claim made
against them was to be heard in a Melbourne court.
   Documents filed with the court showed Herscu had total debts of
more than $382 million and assets of only $1.5 million.
   Once among the social elite of Melbourne, Herscu was forced to
move out of his Toorak mansion, an extravagant home that was based
on ``Tara'' from the movie ``Gone With The Wind.''

<TEXT>
   Thomson Consumer Electronics said Wednesday
it was raising factory prices on RCA nd GE brand color television
sets, big-screen TVs and camcorders because of increased fuel costs
and a weak dollar.
   The company said the 3 percent price hike would take effect in
February. It blamed on rising oil and gasoline costs from the
Persian Gulf crisis and the decline in the value of the dollar
against foreign currencies for the increase.
   Thomson said the cost of materials purchased in Japan and Europe
have risen sharply because of the weak dollar, which makes it more
costly to buy foreign-made materials.
   Thomson is suffering ``tens of millions of dollars in annual
costs that are not reflected in today's pricing structure,'' said
Martin J. Holleran, chief executive of Thomson's Sales and
Marketing Co.-Americas.
   Rising energy costs have adversely affected the costs of
transportation and raw materials such as glass, plastics and chips,
he said.
   Holleran said unit sales of color television models are
declining and the prospects for future growth in the smaller screen
sizes are limited. Industry growth is focused on larger screen
models as consumers seek a theater environment in the home, he
said.
   While manufacturing costs have climbed, color TV prices in the
last 10 years have declined more than 27 percent, Holleran said.
   Thomson manufactures RCA and GE brand consumer electronics.

   Eagle-Picher Industries Inc. announced a
tentative agreement Wednesday to pay $460 million over 20 years to
victims of asbestos disease, but plaintiffs' lawyers rejected the
plan as too small.
   Eagle-Picher faces 65,000 claims by workers made ill inhaling
asbestos fibers in a key case in the attempt to clear a nationwide
court backlog stemming from liability over the cancer-causing
mineral.
   Cincinnati-based Eagle-Picher said it reached agreement with two
of four lawyers appointed by U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein
in New York to negotiate a settlement with the company.
   Last month, some plaintiffs' lawyers rejected a proposal that
offered a reported $500 million to victims over the same time
period, and the same attorneys said they would oppose the new
proposal.
   Under the plan, Eagle-Picher would create an independent trust
to resolve asbestos claims. The company would contribute $30
million in the first year, $20 million per year for the next nine
years and $25 million per year in the following 10 years. The plan
would take effect in November 1993.
   In addition, the trust would receive preferred stock that could
be converted after five years into 25 percent of Eagle-Picher
common stock if the company's meets the payment plan, and 50
percent if it does not.
   Eagle-Picher also would set aside 6.75 percent of its net sales
each year to provide for basic operations.
   A hearing was scheduled for Friday on Eagle-Picher's request
that Weinstein declare a class-action to resolve the claims on
grounds the company cannot meet its asbestos liabilities.
   A similar request has been made by the Manville trust fund, the
nation's largest asbestos resolution facility, which faces about
130,000 claims but has run out of money to settle new cases. A
proposal to restructure the trust is pending. Dozens of other
former asbestos users are watching the cases closely.
   Peter Angelos, one of the four plaintiffs' lawyers appointed by
Weinstein to negotiate with Eagle-Picher, said the latest proposal
``wasn't even worthy of consideration.''
   ``The obligations of the company are minimal in relation to the
number of persons who have sustained serious injury by way of
occupational exposure to its products,'' the Baltimore attorney
said.
   The plan was backed by attorneys David Shapiro of New York, who
is representing future claimants, and Stanley Chesley of
Cincinnati, who was added to the negotiating group only last month.
   Angelos said he and the fourth attorney, Henry G. Miller of New
York, were not consulted about the plan announced by Eagle-Picher.
   ``This proposal is millions of dollars less and has millions
less in value than one rejected last month,'' Angelos said. He
placed the present value of the proposal at under $200 million and
the company's potential total potential liabilities at more than $1
billion.
   A spokesman for Eagle-Picher could not be reached for comment.
   Chesley defended the plan, saying that the $460 million fund,
combined with $45 million to pay previously negotiated claims and
and estimated $178 million from the company's net sales make it
worth well over $600 million.
   He said the tentative Eagle-Picher settlement will protect
plaintiffs if the company has to seek bankruptcy court protection.
``This ... is a combination of cash, money, guaranteed income and
equity,'' he said. ``That's a plus.''
   The company has been inundated with lawsuits from people who say
they suffered cancer and respiratory problems from exposure to an
asbestos-based pipe sealant the company made primarily for ships
from 1934 to 1971.
   Eagle-Picher has said it faces insolvency if it does not settle
the claims, and said in a statement Wednesday that ``liquidity will
continue to be a serious concern for the next several months.'' The
company also said it would seek to sell some assets and receive
accommdations from lenders for a period.
   Eagle-Picher has said it has paid more than $500 million in
settlements and legal fees. Asbestos defendants want claims be made
class actions to reduce legal fees they say are exhausting assets
that otherwise could be used to compensate victims.
